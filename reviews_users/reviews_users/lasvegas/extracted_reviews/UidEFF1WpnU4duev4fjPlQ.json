    "text": "My girlfriend and I ate here on New Year's Day (2016). We decided to try a new place and I keep a copy of Las Vegas Weekly's October issue where they did a round-up of the best eats in LV. Therapy's \"In the Gnudi\" dish was ranked as best \"small bites\". So, we took the trip down there. First, the atmosphere is very trendy, but not unnervingly so. What I mean, is it's hip but if you aren't wearing your cuffed selvedge denim or lumbersexual attire, don't fret - you won't feel out of place. There was a mixed demographic of ages. Overall, it felt very comfortable in there. The waitstaff was great, too. They were doing some drink specials but they said only if you were sitting at the bar (which didn't make sense to me 'cause ya know...I was there, right?). But our waiter said he'd honor the prices. So, I wasn't really sure why he even made a point of telling me it was only for the bar, when I guess it really wasn't but whatever...I got my $5 Blackberry Smashes (Bourbon, muddled blackberries, 7up me thinks, mint leaf, powdered sugar). The drink was really good. The bourbon mixed well with the other flavors. I had 3. Got a real nice buzz. Took part in a wedding ceremony at the Plaza later. Not my own. Like to think the booze guided me a little bit there. Another few, who knows...might've been my own. As I mentioned before, we went for the Gnudi. Never had gnudi, but a magazine told me to eat it (the gnudi, not the magazine), so eat I did. It was really good. Baked ricotta balls with some fig jam and cranberry and walnut cristonis to spread it on. The jam with ricotta was a great taste. We also ordered and split the Red Velvet Waffle and Chicken Sliders and Oxtail Empanadas. Everything was great. The food wasn't cheap for the portion sizes, but, well, the food wasn't....cheap. It was all very good quality and I tend to like the smaller portion sizes that don't treat the American stomach like an ever-expanding balloon. I left full but not dragging my engorged colon behind me. With that said, the oxtail empanada portion (4x) was disappointing for the price of $12 (everything was $12). My girlfriend really, really enjoyed the empanadas. I thought the Waffle&Chicken sliders were the best followed by the gnudis and then the empanadas. However, this ranking is slightly arbitrary. Everything was good.  Finally, a disclaimer: I am in no way a gourmand or foodie. Give me an overturned trash can lid and throw a pile of charred meat on it and I'll probably be happy. So, take my opinion of culinary delights with a grain of salt (or whatever seasoning foodies prefer).",

    "text": "We loved the decor and the food was AMAZING!  We started off with an app called Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates stuffed w-goat cheese and almonds), it was sweet and savory and the thick cut bacon was perfectly done.  For dinner we shared a French Dip (roasted prime rib on a toasted hoagie roll) with home made Truffle Chips.  The prime rib melted in your mouth and the chips, oh the chips!  I don't like potato chips, but I tried them anyway.  Glad I did ... I ate half of them myself.  The oil and seasonings on these chips were like nothing I've ever tasted -- they are amazing. Then we ordered the pork sliders.  I was a little doubtful when I noticed the meat was not slathered in BBQ sauce, but once I bit into it I knew why ... the flavor is in the meat.  Not only was it tender juicy and tasty, but it was piled high and there was no gristle or fat chunks in any of it.  The pulled pork rested on a savory bed of mustard slaw ... we loved it.  I also had glass of the house Malbec - smooth and served at room temperature (so many places chill their red wine).  It was delightful.  The portions are so huge that we had no room left for dessert, and we had wanted to try the Cast Iron S'mores.  Next time :-)",

Our server came over immediately, welcomed us, and explained the menu. A few more people walked in, and service started to SLOOOOW.  I noticed they were grossly understaffed. Literally only one or two people, handling 20 tables.   Took about 15 minutes to get water and then we had an opportunity to order drinks, but I requested a sample of their labeled Chardonnay, took another 15 minutes, all and all it took about 45 minutes to just get my drink and we had not even ordered yet, we order It took about another 35 minutes to get our food. Meanwhile we are a party of two and the party of four that were seated after us, had completed their entire meal (drinks, apps, and meals) before we even got our dinner..kind of frustrating.  When we mentioned to our server we had a show to make, he scolded us that we should have told him that EARLIER.  Well we thought 2 hours was plenty of time to just have a drink and dinner (no apps), but we were starting to get pressed for time.   The chimichurri steak was excellent, the Duck Confit was too salty, and I like salt and it was too salty for me.   Overall it would have been an OK dinner, had the server not scold us ;(",

Me: Sure...I could use a therapy session. (LOL)  Friendly greeting when we walked in.  They were going to sit us at a table where we would have to face another party.  For this \"therapy\" session, I needed to be away from people...lol!  So we asked to sit up front, which they obliged.  Nice comfy atmosphere!  Our friendly server asked if it was our first time in and explained the menus to us.  Me: Grey Goose dirty martini  It is going to be that kind of a \"session\"...lol!  We ordered the oxtail empanadas...very tasty...I wonder if they thought about steaming them and making dumplings?  Just a thought!  The Chard Kale salad was really good!  It was served with beets, bacon bits, and a fried egg on top!  I would come here and order that for breakfast!  The mac n cheese...with bacon added.  Like always, I compare any MnCH to Cafe Chole's in San Diego, this one was by far very close.  So it is my 2nd favorite!  The chicken meatballs were just okay...I mean, I liked the sauce, but they just weren't my favorite.  She: Would you like another martini? Me: No, we have to go back to work. She: Where do you work? Me: I'm with my family this week...IT'S WORK!!!  She suggested the chocolate mousse cake and it was delicious!  Not overly sweet and just the right balance of mousse and cake!  As much as I love Le Thai, I'm glad they were closed or we wouldn't have found another great place to come back to when in Vegas!",

My boyfriend and best friend stopped in for some late afternoon snacks after checking out the Mob Museum.  We were seated at the bar because the hostess told us happy hour was going on (20% off food, bar only). The tap list is pretty short but they have some bottle and can selections so I got an apricot hefeweizen from the friendly bartender. So far, so good! I should mention that this is around 3:30 pm and there are only a small handful of others at the bar. Then we ordered the empanada trio and crab dip - both came out pretty quickly. The empanadas were amazing! There were two each of the three different fillings: chorizo, oxtail, and veggie. The chorizo was my favorite but I would eat them all again! The crab dip was also really good, mostly cheese and artichokes (light on the crab), but it had good flavor and the accompanying chips were great.  We were finished with our food and we sat around waiting for awhile... and waited some more... and waited again for our checks. Finally we managed to get them but we wanted them split. Ok, no problem says our bartender. We get them back and the happy hour discount is not applied. By this point we just want to get out of there so we end up paying full price. Not a huge deal, but something to check if you're looking for a deal.",

    "text": "Therapy has a great vibe going for it - the staff are buttoned up in fancy vests, there's 3 large screen TVs at the bar, and the restaurant pulls off an upscale industrial aesthetic. My beau and I decided to stop at Therapy before a concert on a Sunday night around 8PM. The restaurant on the first floor was empty aside from a few people sitting at the bar. We were immediately seated and our orders were taken promptly, but service after that kind of fell flat.  PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM BURGER ($13): Between a choice of this and macaroni and cheese, the burger won! The menu doesn't specify whether this entree comes with a side, so I asked the waitress if the burger came with fries. She said it usually comes with a salad but substituting fries would be no problem. Score! Nobody wants that rabbit food anyways. :P The burger taste-wise was alright - it could have been kicked up a notch or two flavor wise. The fries were warm and had the perfect texture, but likewise were pretty flavorless. We added salt. 3/5    CHIMICHURRI STEAK ($19): My husband said the steak was alright and that it filled him up, despite appearances. This is an a la carte menu item. 3/5  SERVICE: The manager brought us our entrees and opened the door for us as we left, so he was awesome. Our server was mostly absent, though. It was a struggle trying to get refills and the check. Another annoyance was that the table was sticky and left a gross film on my phone cover. 2/5  The real killer here for us was the service. The place was practically empty, so I don't see how the service could be so dismal. Maybe eating at the bar is the way to go here?  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #262",

The location is super cool because it's in downtown, although it might be a little hard to find parking. You definitely have to walk a couple minutes to the restaurant, you cannot just park in front of it. The service has been a hit or miss. The waitresses and hostess are always friendly, but I can't speak too highly of their attentiveness after being seated, but it is hard to blame them too much because it's always been so busy when I come in for a meal.  The ambiance is very urban and very cool, and it's nice that they have a bar!   They have a lot of sharing food, so it's good for a group. Otherwise, it's a little pricier than I prefer to get my own meal. We got the empanada trio, which I would recommend! And the smores skillet is what keeps me coming back!",

I'm glad for the name (though I think it'd be interesting if it was incorporated more into the decor), because this is a really nice place right on the edge of cheesy (but still fun!) Fremont St. We came in on a quiet Tuesday afternoon and went straight for the bar to see what their happy hour therapy shots were. Apparently they change the shot everyday and today it was a yellow cake shot, yum!  Their booze menu is something to write home about, it's extensive and delicious sounding with totally reasonable prices. The staff is very friendly here too. The decor, though not therapy-related I'd say is still therapeutic in its own way. The light colors and soft Edison bulb lighting makes it very inviting and relaxing, which is just what you're looking for in a bar.  I hear good things about the menu, and would love to come back for another shot of Therapy!",

Five minutes later they told us our table was ready.  Service was excellent, staff super friendly. I had the Caesar's salad with chicken, hubby had the short ribs. Both dishes were very tasty. We ordered the bread pudding for dessert which took a long time to reach our table. We were surprised to see the manager approach our table with two glasses of champagne and an apology for the delay on the dessert. Very impressive. We will definitely visit Therapy again when in town.",

    "text": "I am SO deeply grateful for Maria, the GM, and one of the partially Colombian bartenders with glasses from Jersey (whose name I did not get; but you know who you are!). To make this short and sweet, I was having severe dizziness and almost collapsed walking around downtown Vegas (particularly Fremont St) with family on the Monday before Thanksgiving and I happened to walk into this establishment to sit down and see if resting for moment would help me.   The first bartender provided me with some water and said I could sit there for as long as I needed. My headache, dizziness, and numbness in my body was getting worse, and I was getting super worked up about what was happening with my body, and I know the staff could see it was taking a toll on me and my family. The second, and extremely helpful bartender came up to us and offered some kind of drink (with bitters) to see if it would help me and told me that I should probably sit in a comfier chair by the window to relax more. It seems like she notified the general manager about what was going on and the GM made her way over to us. She knew I was suffering and told me that I could go upstairs to lay down if I wanted to, in which I respectfully accepted. We went upstairs and she accommodated me in EVERY way possible to make me feel better. She moved the tables a bit so I could get by and lay down on the flat booth seat, brought me several large and soft-ish packages to lay my legs on to keep up high than my head in case I was low on blood sugar levels, and the bartender brought me some small eats and some water and orange juice. We were just blown away by how amazing and caring these individuals were to me and my family, and for the entire (almost) 2 hours that I rested there, I felt that I was basically pampered and being cared for as if I was some sort of royalty who had a panic attack, lol!   I mean, even the bartender called her friend who is a nurse and let me speak to her on her cell phone about what I was going through! Just absolutely so grateful to have accidentally gone into this place because I know 100% had I walked into anywhere else around this area, nothing would have compared to the treatment I got here.   Both Maria (the GM) and this lovely bartender took amazing care of me, and I deeply appreciate their willingness to calm me down, help me out in anyway possible, and honestly leaving such a good impression on their establishment. I will DEFINITELY come back here to dine in or have drinks the next time I find myself in Las Vegas, because I feel that I owe them big time for everything that they did for me. Writing a nice review is the least I can do for such an amazing establishment whose people cared for me in a time when I needed some comfort and help.   Although I did not officially dine in here, I do have to note that the mashed potatoes that they brough me were delish (even though it sat for a while I wasn't even eating) and the drink with the bitters was all of the rave from my family. They all loved it! My dad and brother both ordered a few beers from the bar so I'm sure they enjoyed their time there too while I suffered, haha.   Nonetheless, if any customer has the pleasure of meeting Maria and the nice bartender, know that you are in great hands. I have restored faith in humanity, especially in a city like Vegas where one would not typically expect such great hospitality due to the negative connotations people perceive Sin City to be like.   Well, I certainly didn't make this short & sweet, but I just want to say again, thank you SO much again for everything! I truly do feel that Therapy certainly fits your restaurant's name (how ironic).",

When we were first dropped off here we were concerned because the neighborhood looked a little iffy but then we found this little place due to Yelp and everything was alright.  We think our waiter's name was Michael but have forgotten over the last few days.  We do know he was a newlywed.  He was an absolute sweetheart who not only recommended delicious meals but took the time to talk with us and help us to navigate Fremont Street.  I would never have ordered the amazing beet salad if not for him, it was unique, beautifully presented and delicious.  My husband had the chicken and waffles with French fries, a little hard to pick up and eat but yummy!  The atmosphere in Therapy was wonderful and must be perfect to hang out when the place is crowded later in the day.  We highly recommend this place!

Service was OK, nothing to rave about.  To get to the point, by the time we got home BOTH of our stomachs were torn up.

All of our 65 guests raved about the deliciousness and quantity of food--everyone was beyond satisfied. We even had several people tell us it was the best wedding dinner they have ever had (my uncle, who plays in a wedding band, was one of them!). It is also a really neat place--the lighting was moody, the vibe was perfectly cool, and the A/C in Vegas July heat was refreshingly on point.  We worked with Peggy and Maria. Peggy gave us everything we wanted, and Maria executed the dinner flawlessly. Maria made us feel SO special. She was genuinely excited for us, she let us pick the background music, and she ensured that her team provided exceptional customer service. We had a few waitstaff working with us, and while I don't remember all of their names, I do remember one was Jonathan. He was fabulous, quick with drinks, and professional.  I could go on and on and on. Best place ever!",

Laid back, clean, and a cool atmosphere, with good music playing. Johnathan made it a great experience. Please eat at Therapy!",

We ordered the crab artichoke dip and that was delicious! I also ordered the steak and fries and that was less desirable. I ordered it medium rare but because it was a small 6oz steak, only half of it was MR. The rest was well done. My husband ordered the French dip, replacing the horseradish with mayo, and when it came out, it had horseradish. So they quickly took it back and remade it. When done correctly, he said it was really good. Their music selection was cool and I enjoyed the ambiance. I would definitely like to come back and try their dinner menu.",

The only annoying part of the visit was the multiple requests for us to Yelp about experience. Every time we complimented or enjoyed something everyone from the manager to the servers asked us to Yelp the restaurant and to mention them individually.   I didn't understand the constant requests since the restaurant came highly recommended and seemed to be well established and doing well. I promised I would Yelp - so I logged in and saw the post about Dirty Dining from 10 days ago and suspect that is the culprit for constant positive feedback requests.   All is all- great dining experience but the requests for social media endorsements needs to be toned down.",

The place is a little loud, probably because of how open it is.  Some of the tables are close to each other, so you can sort of hear other people's conversations.   We tried: Oxtail empanadas - perfectly tender and juicy meat and just the right amount. Loved them! Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider - Wow!  This was the star for me.  The chicken was juicy, crispy and had a touch of spice. The waffles were not too sweet and the syrup is soooo good.   Super Mac - This is a huge portion. Creamy and delicious! Crumbled Carrot Cake - The perfect carrot cake. Yummy!  Loved this!!",

When we told the hostess her response was perfect and she immediately moved us to a different table. Our waiter was great. Just chatty enough and very attentive.   The Smash coctail with bourbon, black berries, mint, lime etc. was delicious! Ordered a second. We ordered from the Social menu. The beef tartar was yummy and made even better with the pickled turnips, cauliflower and pickles. We also ordered the ox tail empanadas.  The ox tail was sumptuous but I always prefer empanadas baked not fried. The baked Califlower with dates and curry was like a meat dish. Be sure to eat the mint with it. Takes the flavor over the top.   We didn't have room for dessert but they looked good too.  Overall a great experience. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for hearty flavorful inventive food.",

We were not greeted by the host sitting outside, just a simple \"two of you???\".  She then walks inside to grab menus with a snotty look on her face.  Upon turning around to lead us to a table, she gives us now an even more annoyed look and asks \"you want a table?\"...obviously...that's all there was!!  She then touches her headset, where an apparent manager tells her something.  She then says \"we are doing last call actually\"...naturally I am confused as I see about 12 tables in mid meal and a fully staffed bar.  Apparently \"they usually do last call at 10pm\", but they stop seating at 11pm.  I have never heard that in my life.  Needless to say we walked out and ate elsewhere.  I wish them luck by choosing to do last call in Las Vegas at 10pm, but show closing hours at 11pm, won't be back! Too much competition in this town to be treated like that.  No one wants to work anymore these days...",

It was mac and cheese with a side of slices steak. The steak was served on the wide lip of a large bowl, so when I tried to cut it the bowl would tip. After waiting 10 minutes for my fiance's food (fried mac and cheese croquettes) we decided to push my entree to the middle of the table so we could share it before it got cold. It wasn't bad, but not memorable either. The ox tail empanadas came next, and were really bland. Still no croquettes, which finally came after two reminders we made to our server, who we had to track down after not seeing him for 20 minutes. However, the croquettes with the tomato bacon jam were really good.",

    "text": "This place seriously is Therapy! I have been to this location on several occasions with family , friends, and for date nights with my boyfriend. I'll be fair to say I haven't tried everything on the menu but I must say I have tried many , many items. Everything I have had so far has been AMAZING! This is NOT low quality food by any means. The empanadas, fried mac , and the burger, etc are not the basic cheaply made items you'll get at other establishments.  For instance, the burger is a Wagyu Beef Burger , and the fried mac is on a bed of bacon jam!! Where has bacon jam been all my life?     They have many crafted cocktails, and I try to try a new one each time I go but my favorite is the Raspberry Rose. It's a rum drink that I think pairs well with a lot of items on the menu.  Service is always attentive! I usually end up with Christi or Michael and they are both really fast, professional and friendly. Maria is their general manager and seems to always be walking around the restaurant to make sure everything runs smoothly!   I heard that they will be opening a nightclub soon and I am so thrilled to see how it transitions!!!",

Definitely threw me off after walking in. Such a nice place and they have nice wood style covered menus for the drinks and then laminated diner style one page menus for food??  It honestly made me second guess our restaurant choice until the food came. Small complaint but it stopped us from ordering more off the menu cause we weren't sure if the quality of food would match the menu",

I mean who doesn't love alcohol/ a fun time (if you're over 21 of course)?! Ask for servers Francisco and TY and I promise they will make your first time and last time MEANINGFUL! I love a great happy hour whether it be good food or alcohol, I enjoy indulging my boyfriend and I came on Wednesday which is our Fridays and loved every last minute of it, considering we came 20 minutes before closing LOL regardless! We come every Wednesday and love love love it. Other than paying/finding parking everything else is great about this GEM. If it's an option to come here I say YES!",

Today we had the opportunity to sample many of the items we chose off the group menu, and we aren't regretting our leap of faith. The food is great and service is outstanding! The fried mac & cheese croquettes are a must-have. They are served with a tomato-bacon jelly which is surprisingly spicy and a little sweet. We also recommend the sliced steak chimichurri - be sure to get a combination of steak, chimichurri sauce and fried onions in every bite for the best flavor experience. Don't miss out on the carrot cake crumble!!! We also tried the s'mores which comes with bacon for the sweet-salty experience. The bar has so many options we didn't know where to start but since we had to drive home, we opted for a single glass of sangria which did not disappoint.",

I also ordered the red velvet chicken and waffles which were good, but I felt like there wasn't enough chicken. Im knocking a star off bc it took us AN HOUR to get our food. And I get it, I work in foods but an hour??? Really ? So moral of the story is DO NOT come here if you are hungry (like I was) but DO come here if you are patient and you love BOMB food bc again I'm salivating just THINKING of this Mac n cheese.(our server was also AMAZING just sad the food took so long! )",

There were zero drink specials  which is odd for a Fremont East bar. We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, which came in three fried balls which were bland. The sauce they came in, however, was   delightful. They don't have Bud Light or Miller Lite on draft, so I got stuck with Stella. My wife ordered a strawberry salad while I went with the chicken meatballs. She loved her salad but came in a portion size more suitable for smurfs. There were 6 small, dry chicken meatballs which definitely could have used more flavor. Then we ordered Irish coffees, which came in something akin to a Dixie cup for ten bucks. Our server seemed super high and out of touch with anything resembling reality. She kept bringing us food ordered by other tables. The TVs were all stuck on the Food Channel, which reminded us just how bland this venue is. Just not a good experience at all. Oh, and we spent $120 there, too!",

Our waitress was awesome, recommending two really good glasses of pinot noir. Wife salad was very good but my sandwich was a huge letdown. It was a sloppy mess, overstuffed with (perfectly cooked) prime rib and cheese. There was so much juice in the meat that, as delivered, the bottom of the sandwich was sitting in juice. The taste was excellent, and I did not waste anything, but it was more of an Italian beef sandwich rather than a french dip. The best french dips I have had used crusty bread and beef devoid of excess juice. After all, that is what the au-jus on the side is for.",

Since the food had such good reviews on Yelp we decided to give it a try and we were glad we did. The food was absolutely delicious! I had the burger and fries and it was so juicy and the fries were perfect. My husband ordered the empanadas and the Brussels sprouts. I did not know Brussel sprouts could taste so good! The description of the restaurant says it's a tapas restaurant but I've been to many tapas (small plates) restaurants and this restaurant did not have any \"small\" plates. The empanadas were under the small plates category but it was a large portion of 4 empanadas. The brussel sprouts were definitely enough for two. I highly recommend stopping in for a bite to eat!

    "text": "Therapy should win one of those best of awards for their salads alone. My husband and I strolled in after a vigorous workout, and had the most amazing and hearty salads. Full disclosure: I was not a fan of the Beets By Therapy. I thought I was a green leafy salad with pieces of beets, hearts of palms, hazelnuts,  goat cheese, pickled kumquats & orange ash. Instead, there were no greens and the full size salad was more like a fun-size salad. My husband ordered Therapy's Signature Salad with radishes, Granny Smith Apples, candied walnuts, blue cheese crumbles, and a white balsamic vinaigrette. He added chicken to it too, and could barely finish. Our server accidentally sent me the half-size portion of the Signature Salad without chicken instead of the Caesar Salad. She let me keep them both and I couldn't decide which one I loved more. It's like saying, which child do you love the most? Well, it depends on the day. All kidding aside, the salads were bomb and so was the Drinken Tofu. To all my virgin drinking friends, the raspberry lemonade is iconic! I will be back to try their chicken and red velvet waffle.",

With an add on a bacon, it's a $20 hamburger. For 20 bucks you expected to be really really good. In fact, the Big Sexy Burger was just meh. The bun was disappointing. The meat was supposed to be wagyu beef. If it was wagyu beef, it certainly tasted no different than ordinary chop meat. I had the Ricky Ricardo Cuban sandwich. It was good. But certainly nothing special. For $17 it was certainly not a good value. We did find two of the menu items quite good. The gnudi was excellent! And the Truffle fries we're also excellent. But having two excellent side dishes when the main course is just meh is disappointing at best.",

I ordered the red velvet chicken waffle and it was so delicious! The waffle was crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. My friend ordered the crab artichoke and that was super tasty as well, I wanted to order more of everything! On top of all that, our desert was also super good. We had the s'mores with bacon, bacon! I didn't know you could eat that together but my goodness whoever thought of that is a genius! The salty and sweetness balanced out really well making it not too sweet.

The place appeared as though there was no where to seat us since it was packed, but to my surprise there was an upstairs, and we were sat immediately. Everyone working in the restaurant was super friendly and greeted us as we walked passed.   I chose the chicken and red velvet waffle sliders due to all the rave reviews, and sad to say I was disappointed. The portion size was huge and filling, which was a plus. The flavor is where I felt the dish was lacking. The chicken was too salty, and the salt overpowered all of the other flavors besides the syrup.... But I didn't buy this to just taste syrup. The red velvet waffles had a cake consistency, but no red velvet taste. I also wasn't a fan of the \"slaw\" which was torn pieces of lettuce with sauce, but then again I was expecting southern slaw which was probably the wrong assumption.   I think this dish is a great idea and the presentation is beautiful, but I felt the execution was poor. Maybe the flavors vary based off who cooks it. More prominent, balanced flavors would do this dish justice.",

We ordered Devils on Horseback, Crab Artichoke dip, omg the Cuban sandwich was sooooo good and tasty, the Big Sexy and Korean pork belly plate - everything was tasty as hell!  Brandee (with 2 Es!) was an excellent server and on top of it! My only complaint was...I forgot my leftovers!!  P.s.

Its in a perfect location mixed between a lot of bars with not very vast menus and an atmosphere to set it apart from its surroundings.   The food and bar menu is impressive, a great selection and even picky drinkers and eaters can find something to enjoy. After much deliberation we picked a few different plates to try and share, I highly recommend the French Dip and Smores! We tried the meat platter, the pretzel bites, and Mac and Cheese and no complaints about any of them. The food is perfectly seasoned and all the sauces, dips, and gravies were mouth watering making you want more food for the dipping!  With drinks, a full meal, and dessert our bill was under $100. We were sat right away with friendly staff who offered recommendations. The music was great, all the servers and busses were very friendly. I loved the chairs at the table, you should be comfy while you eat! This will be a great sports bar and a highlight this football season.",

The pork chop was thick and juicy my father in law was pleased and shared bites with everyone.  The meatballs were well seasoned but a tad dry. Overall it was enough to bring us back.  Atmosphere was an A and service was on point.  We will come back to try the other items on the menu.",

We also tried the truffle Mac and cheese but the truffle taste was so overpowering, you couldn't taste much else. The ambiance was nice aside from the big screen TVs playing children being operated on for cleft palates. Extremely distracting. Service was okay but not excellent.

We had the Caesar salad, with what tasted like home made Caesar dressing. Then the pretzel bread with a great tasting dipping sauce. My husband had the French dip, which was very flavorful. I had the chicken with red velvet waffles, which were amazing! They also have a good selection of beers. Highly recommend!",

Both of these were excellent however after 2 minutes on the table (not even enough time to share half of one of the apps) the OWNER, who apparently is also the food runner, brought our main courses which sat at our table and died for 12 minutes while we enjoyed the rest of our apps. Listen, this place is cool and has some decent food and drink but if the owner is running food like that, good luck. We had a nice seat up front of the restaurant where a carry out type \"open\" sign was trashily blinking in the corner of my eye all dinner. I ordered the chimichurri steak and it was good. Very flavorful. My date ordered the French dip sandwich. It was very fatty beef, boring bread.  Don't order the French dip. All in all they are pretending to be something they're not.

Plus we had the \"Ricky Ricardo\" sandwich which is a Cuban style sandwich and that was awesome too.

The chicken and waffles were paired nicely with vanilla maple syrup and a spicy remoulade sauce. The corn was covered in cheese and spices.

We also tried some street corn here which was delicious and slightly better than Gluttons primarily because it was served on the cob and as a result wasn't soaked in the sauces - it made it feel less heavy.  The drinks we had were somewhat a miss. I tried their much hyped Smash drink and it was just ok. We also tried the mango and lychee blended drink but it was very tasteless with only a hint of alcohol.  The atmosphere here is slightly nicer than the general downtown feel - it's got a nice open layout and a modern look. Definitely a place that one could spend some time and feel comfortable in. That being said, it's a little pricier than other places nearby.",

The decor is nice, the food upscale - but not too bad price wise. They have a lot of things that are good for sharing, so this would be a great place for a mid-day snack or a meal where you want to share with your friends.   We had a lot of food. The Crab Dip, the Big Sexy, the French Dip, The Carrot Cake and The Chocolate Soufle. All were good. The Carrot Cake slightly dry and the Soufle not the best I had ever had, but still rather satisfying. There were many things on the menu and the drink menu that I would come back here to try.   Ultimately, I would come again and recommend this spot for your dining adventures.",

It was pretty busy on a Saturday night, but called ahead to make reservations. Food was great! The red velvet waffles were great and fried chicken was juicy! Definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner or even lunch. I will more than likely return when I'm in town again. Thanks Yelpers for helping us find yet another great restaurant!",

Had the Brussels because it was a highlight for many yelpers and sad to say they were extremely disappointing. The Caesar salad, which was served an hour after we ordered it, is worth a quarter of what they are charging for it. Chorizo empanadas and bacon-wrapped dates were decent, but not worth a visit. Staff were not knowledgeable about the menu or the wine list. $100 for two people, for a meal that is probably worth $40 at most. If you're going all the way downtown for a good meal, skip this place and go to Carson Kitchen or Le Thai.",

There was a make and a female bartender and we were approached by the guy. He carded us which is just ridiculous since he was much younger than us, then we sat there reading the menus and he never came back to ask if we wanted a drinks or food. The bar was 25% full when we sat down so he was not busy but he never approached us so we bailed. I guest maybe this place was just too cool for school.",

First time I had something go sideways and I thought I'd share. My wife and I decided to stop in for dinner, we're locals so we've been to this spot a bunch of times and we love it. Wife had a cocktail and Gabby proceeded to tell us that she would have to finish before we could be seated at a table... my wife inquires, \"since when?\" .. Gabby informs her \"Since always\". Well.. coming from a customer service industry I had to educate Gabby on the way out... let her know that wasn't the most customer service response she could have provided. Shared a couple of examples of what would have been fitting and how she should course correct in future if she wishes to find success in a customer facing role. Hoping it's the first and last time I have to see her. Her response to my feedback demonstrated she's not the best person to be dealing with customer face to face.",

    "text": "Cute new restaurant downtown. We went for a little tasting for a work event and it was enough of a tease, a good tease to make us want to come back for more. We got a taste of the carrot cake with brown butter ice cream, baked ricotta with fig jam on a walnut cranberry crostini, chicken meatball with cilantro pesto, gulf shrimp ceviche and summer squash flatbread. And upon arrival greeted with a delicious Cab. All very tasty!  Back for lunch the following day for a team lunch. I got the hangar steak tartare which the presentation was cute and liked the pickled toppings. Street corn was my favorite!! If you like bacon the popcorn mix is different and a fun appetizer.  I do recommend if you are going for lunch or a meal order the burger or French dip because the price you pay for a flatbread is the same and you get more for your money for a full sandwich.  Seems a little odd that you pay the same for a giant/good size burger or French dip and a small flatbread. The flatbread won't fill you up unless you have a bunch of other snacks. It's more of a pricey appetizer small plate, the middle section of the menu. It's good just not a meal if that is what you are expecting, so I think pricing is a little disproportionate.  Otherwise great new option downtown. I will be back to try the burger and dessert!",

We had amazing service, and they even brought out a s'mores dessert for my birthday, which, BTW was SO DELICIOUS, it was worth breaking my Keto diet for.  Seriously, I haven't had such a delicious dessert like that in so long.    I ordered the The \"Big Sexy\" burger without the bun, and added bacon and an egg to it, gave my fries away, but another friend did the same and changed the fries to a salad, which I should have done.  The portions are generous, and I was full, and we all eat a lot. (we all powerlift) We also ordered some other appetizers including crab dip (AMAZING, although i think it would taste better with bread vs chips), charred brussel sprouts (my personal favorite),   My friend's chimichurri steak was phenomenal. Everybody at the table enjoyed their food. I was completely surprised a restaurant of this caliber is out in DTLV, since I come to the golden nugget at least twice a year for a week for work, I am glad I found a good little spot to get my grub on!   Prices are decent for what you get, I've been to a \"nice\" restaurant in beverly hills and had the WORST bunless burger which was around 4-5 dollars more than what they charge here and this place blew that burger out of the water. To be honest, this may be one of the best burgers I had.",

We were seated on the upper level. Not a huge menu but something for everyone. I had chicken, with mashed potatoes, and broccoli with mole sauce. I got the sauce on the side since I had never had it before. Not for me but my boyfriend liked the mole sauce. My boyfriend got steak. It was a nice size serving. Everything was awesome. Service was great. Waiter didn't try and rush us. Very nice clean restaurant. Will definitely come again when I'm near Fremont Street. The reason I gave a four star is the tables are extremely close together upstairs. I don't like touching elbows with people at next table.",

We enjoyed the delicious food and our waiter Jonathan Thomas was phenomenal. The service he gave us was top notch!  I connected with Jonathan because I am from Maine and Jonathan had lived in Bangor, ME when he was younger.  He was very understanding and sympathetic as I had just lost my husband a month and a half earlier. We became instant friends and kept in touch over the years.   Fast forward to now when our Plexus Convention was in Las Vegas again. We decided to eat at Therapy and when I walked into the restaurant and saw that Jonathan was our waiter, my heart couldn't have been happier. I sprang from my chair and gave him a great big hug!  Old friends reconnecting again!  Here we are three years later and Jonathan is still an amazing waiter at Therapy. He never lost his touch. He was attentive to all our needs from the drinks to the food and dessert. He suggested the short ribs to my friends and they absolutely loved them! I had the Therapy Signature Salad and we all enjoyed the carrot cake for dessert.  Jonathan always checked on us being attentive to all our needs and making sure we had the best dining experience ever. He was very pleasant, curtious and kind. As far as I'm concerned, Jonathan is the BEST!",

My husband and myself are locals and we frequent DTLV often whether for business or pleasure. I have never been treated so poorly by a supervisor in my 30+ years of life.   We ordered a few social plates and entrees as well as drinks, it was date night we were ready for a great night! Well it started well Jonathan was very pleasant got us taken care of quickly. When the food arrived the presentation was great so we dug in. The crab dip was sooo good , we also ordered the red velvet waffle chicken sliders (the reason we came). When we bit into the chicken the texture was like rubber! We apologized to Johnathan and told him about our displeasure he was very kind and apologized.   MARIA the night manager came over and \"apologized\" by saying \"I'm sorry you did not like our dish it's made with real organic chicken and we have never had an issue\" ...... as to say we don't buy nor have we had organic chicken. She talked over me and spoke very harsh and abrupt. I never pull the race card but discrimination is what I felt. Yes we were the only Black couple but I didn't feel that until this moment! It was date night for us we were ready to order it all of we wanted to but after this we paid for our drinks and crab dip and ended our night. Ended up at a pub we frequent with our mood completely shot!   We tipped Jonathan and thanked him he apologized multiple times , even the guest next to us couldn't believe how she spoke to us! We will not recommend this establishments any of our friends nor partners",

Therapy is a cool funky type pub/lounge that has great food, friendly staff and decent prices.   We sat at the bar to take advantage of Happy Hour menu, which included $5 beer, wine, Mimosas, Bellini's, well cocktails, a Happy Hour menu and 20% off all regular priced food items.   I had a Bellini, and my husband had a beer. We split the shrimp ceviche which was excellent ! It was a generous portion, served alongside black bean taco chips. So good - if you like seafood - I highly recommend!   We asked our server / bartender Kimberly what she suggested for a main. She chose the Ricky Ricardo ( which we both were considering ) It is a Cuban sandwich filled with pork, ham, cheese and pickles. It was very good. We split this as well and it was enough to have us both satisfied.   We each had another drink and got the bill. It came to under 45$ including tax which seemed really decent.   Kimberly was behind friendly and polite. The ambiance was cool, and I really liked all the metal sculptures that were all over the place. It's not old and smoke filled like most of Downtown Vegas. I would definitely return and totally recommend.",

We also ordered Pork Belly and I asked if it was fatty and the server said not too much but it was quite fatty and had little meat. My boyfriend liked Devil on Horseback, and The Ricky Ricardo was supposed to be cuban style but the flavor didn't taste like a cuban sauce. It was tasteful but they should have called it something else.  The restaurant is spacious with a high ceiling which we like. We were seated upstairs with a table overlooking the restaurant.

It did advertise it on Yelp as being a popular tapas restaurant, which I would say is inaccurate to their food offerings during lunch. We ordered the steak-frites ($15), charred Brussel sprouts ($10), and crumbled carrot cake ($9). The waitress raved that we would come back for the Brussel sprouts, and she may be right. What I loved about these Brussel sprouts, unlike other comparable dishes, is that you could actual taste the Brussel sprouts in combination with the cheese, sauce, and cashews. The steak was prepared at a good temperature and accompanied by deliciously fried frites. The crumbled carrot cake was a cool deconstructed version. Besides the Brussel sprouts, I would say that the service and music would have me coming back. Our waitress was so polite and attentive. The music was all of my favorite latin hits! The reason it doesn't get a 5 from me is coming from the taste and price categories. The only dish I believe to be priced accurately would be the steak-frites. Overall, this place gets a 4/4.5.",

We had a reservation for a party of 7 and when we arrived a few minutes early, there was a beautiful table all set up and waiting for us. We were immediately greeted by Jonathan who was our server for the evening. If I could create the perfect person to represent a classy, hip, urban place such as this, it would be Jonathan. He was kind, funny, and so attentive to anything we needed. He didn't even mind as our party size kept changing (only 2 of the other 5 people in our party ended up making it and they showed up much later). The food was so good - we shared the Therapy's Crab Dip for a starter and it was the best one I've ever had anywhere. We ordered the \"Big Sexy\" burgers for our meal and those bad boys were juicy, scrumptious, and cooked to perfection. The bartenders nailed classic old-school cocktails and the overall ambiance of the restaurant is inviting and classy. I didn't get the name of the brunette hostess but she is such a wonderful first impression to this establishment. She and I spoke as she stood at her station outside in front of the restaurant while I stood outside to vape on and off throughout the evening. She answered questions I had about the restaurant and other random things we saw pass by and she was so adorable, sweet and professional. We were all impressed with Therapy for the amazing food, drinks and atmosphere, but it is their incredible staff that really made this an unforgettable experience for us.",

Variety of appetizers from chicken meatballs over a spicy fresh jalapeno pesto, chorizo empanadas, braised tofu over shishito peppers. Hubby had the braised short ribs over sun chokes- deep rich flavors tender beef.  I had the catch of the day, crispy salmon over farro, delish.  Hubby luved their signature cocktails; bartender brought us 2 samples of his concoctions, rum punch was good, mescal mixture was bad.  Decor is nice and open, great finishing touches. Open area acoustics is a bit noisy, while you're trying to have a quiet intimate dinner.  Service is friendly and attentive. You need reservations as they get pretty busy during the dinner rush.

It seemed like there was a party going on up stairs because there was constant yelling coming from a group of ladies.   The menu is very different from what I'm use to. There were many different items I had never heard of or tried.   We decided to try the DEVILS ON A HORSEBACK -Bacon Wrapped Dates Stuffed With Truffle Goat Cheese & Almonds on a bed of romesco.   We only ordered that item which was an appetizer and the server informed us it was going to take about 45 minutes to be ready. I didn't ready think it was worth waiting for but we wanted to try something new so we waited. When the appetizer arrived it was about 6 of the dates. The taste was sweet and then crunch from the bacon. The romesco sauce was very tasteful.   Over all the atmosphere wasn't my style and the wait time was way too long for some appetizers. I might give it another try to see if maybe at a different time it would be better.",

Little did she know the financial standing he has. After everything, she would not take our order and eventually told us that we were too loud. It is March madness, and this is Vegas. She was well compensated and still very judgemental. I don't want to claim racism, however there was no other patrons of any ethnicity at the. I'm done.",

The service was impeccable, the space was perfect and the food was delicious - seriously, all 35 people loved the food...hard to do for a diverse group!  Our meal was served family style and we enjoyed in the gnudi, shrimp ceviche, Therapy's signature salad, Scottish salmon, sliced chimichurri steak, fire roasted corn, brussels sprouts, mac 'n cheese, s'mores and carrot cake.  It was an abundance of food, but worth every calorie!",

It's worth it!  We had the Devils on Horseback, Fried MAC Croquettes and Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles. Each better than the last. Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding was decadent. We've eaten at many Vegas high end venues and Therapy can compete with any of them.  Our server, Jonathan was personable and knowledgeable. Great job!",

Things went a bit sideways after I ordered the filet. Flavor wise it was spot on, but the cook went about two steps past medium rare that I ordered. The filet came out medium with light pink in the middle and lots of grey on either side. It was such a shame as the spinach and potatoes it sat on we're great and the presentation was wonderful. 2 stars seems a bit harsh but given the sin of overcooking a filet I can't give Therapy more than 3 stars.",

A group of 6 of us went to eat there after walking up and down Fremont looking for food.  Right off the bat it looks like a cool place with a very hipstery vibe. We get seated right away and ordered drinks and food.  The drinks and appetizer came right out and everything was perfect.  Then we waited.  And waited. And waited.  Our conversations got quieter as we all realized it had been about an hour since we ordered and no food had arrived.  We were also staring at our empty glasses with our server nowhere in sight.  Long story short, we waited about 90 minutes for our food, but we did receive several apologies from our server, the manager and the food-runner along with a round of drinks from the manager.  The food was very good when it finally came out.  All in all, someone made a mistake (which happens) and we appreciated the effort that the people at Therapy made to make it right.  This was just a bad experience at a good restaurant.",

Great food (mac and cheese croquettes, empanadas, and street corn). We loved it all.  The croquettes were very good but what put it over the top was the tomato and bacon jam.  It was like a very thick barbecue sauce with the saltiness and smokiness of the bacon.  The street corn was fantastic, with grill marks and a finger licking lime aioli.  Lots of cocktail options.  I think the beer offering, both tap and bottles, was not as strong as previous visits.  They seemed to have moved away from craft brews.",

We sat at the bar and very much enjoyed Shannon's wit and highly-competent service.

The only thing I would like to see improving is the food portion is a bit small for the price being charged.   The best part of about this place is that it turns into an unltra lounge at 11:00 PM which makes this place a great choice to grab a drink.  The resident dj puts together great sets of music to compliment the ambience of the venue. All of us have thoroughly enjoyed our time here because of this new change.   Take a visit, you'll love the food, drinks, ambience, especially the music.   **I particularly don't understand why certain reviews would even complain about the good music being played here.

    "text": "After a bad first experience, I was contacted immediately by the management team to talk about the problems, and was invited back in to give it a second chance with a guest. I appreciated the quick follow up, and of course was willing to go back and see how they could turn it around.   My friend and I who were there the first time came back in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon at 12:30pm, and the 2nd time around was 100x better than the last (of course). It wasn't very busy, but our food came out very quickly, which I'm sure was not a coincidence since that was a huge complaint of mine last time. We each started with a salad, I with the charred kale and poached egg, and she with the caesar. We split the pretzel appetizer- the cheese mustard sauce is AMAZING. We split the side of mac n cheese (with bacon on the side for her, which was successful in execution this time), and then were surprised with FOUR desserts that came out. The fresh sorbets were a delight, I believe they were cherry, key lime, and passion fruit. The popular s'more cast iron skillet was among them, which was far too sweet for me, but she liked. The decomposed carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and brown butter ice cream was a pleasant surprise for me, and made a great breakfast the next day! The manager ALSO brought a chocolate ganache torte type ensemble out in a to go box, which was really just indulgent and over the top, but we appreciated the effort and it did get eaten a couple days later :)   The food was much better, the service was great, and we had a chance to chat with the chef and management. Of course it was a comp meal, but not everyone makes the effort to remedy a bad dining experience, and they really went above and beyond to make sure we had a good time the 2nd time around, and the VP of Ops even followed up that afternoon with a phone call. Now THAT's hospitality.",

The empanadas were ok. They were deep fried which i do not like and they were served with a tasteless mayonaise type sauce.  The Caesar dressing on the salad was good but the salad has so much dressing on it. A good salad is not drenched with dressing. The crab dip was ok. They serve it with tortilla chips that were soggy not crispy. We asked for them to be replaced which they did with much better crispy ones but then they charged us for an extra order of chips. The service was also with unfriendly wattresses except for one of them. All in all we were very dissapointed with everything and we would not recommend it.",

The space has very high ceilings with some industrial ductwork and also cool wood-plank ceilings. It feels airy and fun and can handle a lot of sound without becoming unpleasantly noisy. Had the house salad with greens, apples, bleu cheese, walnuts and big slices of thin radish. It was big enough for a meal in itself, but not knowing that, I also ordered the barramundi sliders. Tasty toasted buns and pan-seared fish chunks with a tangy zing--something you can't get just anywhere. Francisco at the bar was all over it and made me a really tasty gin cocktail with a nice balance of citrus and botanical. I'd definitely come back and if you're looking for something more than just greasy bar food downtown, give Therapy a shot.",

We were making walnut-cranberry crostini sandwiches with bri and spicy moustard, dipped weird little pickled beets in an apple jam and spent a lot of time saying, \"Hmm, what the heck is this?\" It was fun but a little pricy for a sharable app for 2.   The drinks were great, we had the Devils Eyes; a mint and absynthe tasty frozen drink. These bartenders are seriously professionals. They were practically dancing they were so busy but did their job with focus and accuracy.",

My wife and I were out site-seeing and stumbled upon Therapy. It was later in the evening so we only had to wait a couple of minutes for a table, it looks like it stays pretty busy, I would suggest a reservation. Joy was our waitress, she was helpful, fun, and quick. Make sure you request her, you'll think me later.          We ate the Mac and Cheese Croquette, that we're suggested by Joy, and they're the bomb. We also ordered the Braised Ribs and Chimichurri Steak but couldn't decide which was better, but after licking the plates the Chimichurri may have taken prize.          We'll probably go back tomorrow for round 2. Call me crazy but Therapy could actually be a reason to move to Vegas. Ha, see what I did there \"Therapy & crazy\".  GOOD EATS!!!   Bon ap",

I chose this spot based on friends' recommendations. I thought it was OK, but nothing to get excited about.  The ambiance is Big City Hipster  -- exposed ductwork, painted brick walls, a sort of upstairs dining loft above the main floor. The vibe is bustling and noisy, the air thick with clanking cutlery and snarky witticisms. Service was great and the crowd was attractive.  Food-wise, you might say I didn't try enough stuff to give it a fair review. I had a burger, which was alright but unexciting, plus a side of Brussels sprouts (shut up, I can pair whatever I want) which were fantastic. One of the Ginas had a flatbread sort of pizza thing which was also kinda meh. So considering that 2 out of the 3 things I tried were meh...I just don't feel an urgency to come back here.  I mean, I spent $35 -- for that, I could have gone to Chipotle three times, and experienced three times the exposed ductwork and snarky witticisms. Yawn!",

    "text": "We randomly came here to eat on a Thursday night.  For starters, everyone was pleasant, from the hostess to waitresses to bartender. I decided to order three appetizers and a salad for the table to share.  The crab dip and oxtail empanadas were delicious to say the least. Both were cooked to perfection where they had a slightly crispy exterior. However, the crab dip was an amazing consistency to the point it was velvety, while the oxtail inside the empanadas gave a tender, buttery filling. As for the salad (we got the Therapy Signature) it was fresh, tasty, and oh so colorful!  The only disappointment was the \"In the Gnudi.\" It's an appetizer with baked ricotta and toasted walnut bread with some fancy sauces included. However, it was too sweet, especially as an appetizer. It seemed much more fitting as a luxury dessert of some sort, so we didn't finish the plate.   Small note: The restaurant was loud (like really really loud) to the point where we couldn't hear each other across the small table. I am not sure if it was just the spot we sat in, but if you end up going for a date night, you might want to ask the hostess for a spot that is quieter.",

The burger was juicy and flavorful.  You really can't go wrong with wagyu beef.   We also got 2 drinks: the mango lychee sangria and melon sangria. Both refreshing and not too strong.   I'd like to go back again, and hopefully they'll start serving deep fried pig ears and cheese corn again.

We did not have reservations but the two hostesses we extremely accommodating sat the two of us right away up front which was fun. The waiter Rene' was the absolute best! Very helpful, personal, and tons of fun.  Therapy's drinks were amazing mostly bourbon bases with their own smoked version - they brought us a sample it was real smooth with a simple bite at the end and the bottle is gorgeous!  Our food was spectacular the best we have had in Vegas - but that is not really giving it proper merit. The food was superb really have not been impressed with Vegas food until Therapy. The Crab Dip was out of this world good and Fried MAC Croquette with the tomato bacon jam was incredible!  Now back to the drinks, I enjoyed The Smash so much that the hostess let me meet the bartender Michael who taught me how to muddle the berries and mint and make the drink for myself and yes they gave me that one on the House!  The best dinning overall experience I have had in a long time - looking forward to going back this time with reservation or to just sit at the bar to work my way through the drink menu and to have some of their own bourbon! Way to go Therapy!",

The Chimichurri flat iron steak was done just right; tender and juicy. The brick chicken was moist and tasty. The battered fried chicken & red waffle looked pretty but wasn't as crispy as expected. The charred Brussel sprouts was tasty, albeit somewhat over-seasoned. Our server Mike provided high caliber service. Overall it was an enjoyable dinner.",

The brussel sprouts and street corn were so good my husband asked for the recipe. The signature salad was yum and the meat (I got steak well done) was tender and full of flavor. The chicken and red velvet waffles were a brilliant mix of sweet and savory. The shrimp civeche was delicious and full of shrimp.  We shared a couple of servings of the banana bread pudding (served with chocolate, whipped cream, caramel, slices  of banana, and banana sorbet). It was delicious!   The food at Therapy has interesting flavor pairings that you don't find everywhere else. That's a shame because they worked beautifully.  Not one of the 12 people at our dinner had a complaint about our experience. I highly recommend Therapy!",

Our waiter Michael was OUTSTANDING in his service and care making the group comfortable that they would get food they liked and were comfortable with - NOT always easy with children. BUT...he absolutely nailed it and we all had such a good, satisfying, and happy meal!! I already loved the place, but after last night it has risen to one of my favorites in Vegas!!! Thank you Therapy and thank you Michael for such a great night!",

Our server (Berto?) was excellent. He was very attentive and friendly and did not rush us. We had a few signature cocktails that were great, and ordered about a million different menu items! Their menu is just really awesome and we wanted to try everything! My favorite items were definitely \"In the Gnudi\" which is baked ricotta and it was so unique and truly AMAZING, and the s'mores dessert which was exactly what you'd expect and SOOO yummy. We also really liked the drunken tofu, the texture of the tofu was right on point, it was just slightly crispy on the outside and not greasy at all. The shrimp lettuce cups and Korean bao buns were less memorable. And the heirloom tomato and burrata salad was standard but quite good and refreshing. This place is definitely a hidden gem downtown and I can't wait to come back!",

The vibe is comfortable and chromed in shades of blacks and whites, Therapy should always be without many distractions- remember focus on letting go. The service is friendly and the live music really puts one into a pleasurable mood.   On my visit, a friend asked me to join last minute and we sat, drank, ate and conversed in a therapeutic fashion. I ordered the Smash which was a great cocktail of berries and bourbon. I liked it so much that I medicated myself with two! My meal of choice was the Red Velvet Waffles and Chicken Sliders. Seriously, you can't make this stuff up. It truly exists! It was so comforting, so yummy and yes... So theraputic.   Therapy is one of those great Downtown Vegas restaurants with a great vibe and good food. I will definitely be back to Therapy either as an individual or group session!",

The place was relatively empty (hence the 4 star for ambiance, although may be I shouldn't expect much from a restaurant in Fremont street on a Monday) and we were seated immediately.   The food was great!! We had the brussel sprouts, the fire roasted street corn, and the chimichurri steak. We didn't get any drinks and the total without the tip was $53.04. The brussel sprouts was out of this world!!! I really liked it! In fact, I wish I could have some this very minute! The corn was also great! The steak was also quite good, not as incredible as the other two, but still quite good! I highly recommend this place!  Oh, and our server Gloria was super polite and friendly!

Her chicken dish was to die for, as was our Korean-inspired appetizers. Seriously if you don't try this place you are missing out. Our server Gloria was extremely friendly and attentive - we had not been drinking enough water and she kept our glasses full at all times!

Jenna recommended that we start with the Charred Brussels Sprouts which were delicious...a great suggestion. The ladies selected the Veggie flambe and the Chicken & Waffle Sliders; I got the Double-cut Pork Chop. The flambe was a crispy flatbread kind of thing made of several tasty ingredients, but it was sloppy and did not come together as a dish. I remember that the pork chop was very good, but I don't remember what it was served with (sorry). The bottom line is that I was happy. The star of the show was the pair of sliders.

For a Monday I wasn't quite surprised at how empty it was, but we really wanted to see how this ambiance is when it's busy.  I ordered The Meadows and I was pleasantly surprised by how mellow the mint was, but really enjoyed how smooth it was.  We ordered the Mac n Cheese croquettes with the bacon jam, the chorizo empanadas, the corn off the cob, and the Korean bao. I personally loved the Bao and the corn the most, as I found the bacon jam to be a bit overpowering, not that it wasn't bad, but I couldn't taste anything else. I loved the harissa lime aioli that came with the chorizo empanadas and they were extremely flavorful.   For our entrees Jacob ordered the French Dip and I ordered the Ricky Ricardo which is just as good as people have been mentioning. I hope I didn't upset them by not eating the plantains, but I just don't like platanos unless they are fried and covered in salt. Jacob just wished there was a tad more horseradish.  We finished this evening off with the s'mores dessert, which was yummy, but honestly a little much. We felt that if there was a vessel like graham crackers on the side to scoop up the yummy deliciousness it would have brought it over the top!   This place is a definite must try and there is so much more we want to eat there.  Until next time!  Happy Eating!",

Prices are a bit steep, but food quality and service more than make up for it. We tried the bacon-wrapped dates which came with a truffle tomato sauce. They were quite tasty. Then we tried two sandwiches to share expecting the portion size to be like tapas only to be surprised by such large, filling portions! Splitting one sandwich is more than enough for two people. I still don't think I'll have an appetite for dinner! We tried the French dip and the red velvet fried chicken waffle sandwiches and both were decadent with a surprising combination of flavors to delight the palate. We sat in a comfortable booth with a great view of the interior design and hip signage. Plus, the place transforms into a night club during the evening. So a bonus for those looking for some entertainment for their guests.",

Definitely recommend making a reservation for this place, especially on the weekends. They were turning people away left and right.   We tried a few specialty cocktails off their menu and every single one of them was SO delicious! It was pretty busy and we had a big group, there was only 1 bartender, and our server had quite a few other tables. The drinks took awhile to come out, but that's ok considering how delicious they were.   I have to say, the 5 stars are almost entirely due to the food. AMAZING. We pretty much got 1 of everything and shared amongst ourselves. My favorite was the street corn. Basically Elote in a bowl, and by far the best I have ever had! So flavorful!   I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area, and I'll definitely be returning.",

We ordered champagne but sent it back as there was no fizz. A new bottle was opened for us, which was perfect.  We had the s'mores dessert and it was amazingly gooey and delightful, as promised by our server.  We wanted to buy t shirts with the therapy logos but the shirts were incredibly scratchy and not cute.  We saw a cute red one on display as we were leaving and asked if we could see that one. We were informed by our server that the manager refused to come out to show it to us and so we left disappointed.",

Other then that the drinks were great, Diplomatico rum was suggested by our host and was so good me and a friend had to have another. Empanadas were dry, tacos we're 5/10 and was not hot when delivered to our table.

Adobo fried rice was way too salty, fried chicken in The King was dry and missing the crucial sauce, omelette was overloaded with onions we didn't even request for and missing ham, red velvet waffle was hard and overdone. No attempt to make up for it or to acknowledge the poor service at the end either. Disappointing.",

Our server/the bartender was slow. We arrived first ordered and about 30 minutes later 4 friends joined us.  They ordered and it appeared that our server didn't quite hear all of them and my husband tried to point it out.  After waiting for at least 45 minutes for the food to arrive it did with the exception of the one he didn't hear.  \"I thought you didn't order anything\" he said.  He put her order in with a slight protest from her and so we waited. Our friends ate the Betty's biscuits and a Ricky Ricardo (Cuban). The biscuits were doughy and undercooked and the Cuban wasn't very good.  When the forgotten order of Sweet and Savory arrived nearly 20 minutes later it was by far the only acceptable meal the 6 of us had. It was hit and very delicious.  Our server did not charge for the forgotten order or for one of the biscuit orders though. Overall we would not come back to this place.",

The sweetness of the tomato jam really set off the spice of the sirracha aoli and the crunchiness of the croquettes added great texture. We also had the battered chicken sliders in red velvet waffles. We didn't really like the slaw, but the vanilla maple syrup was oustanding. Finally we added the korean bbq bao, with pork belly cooked to perfection - tender yet crispy. The buns soaked up the flavor of the sauce and left us lusting for more. The portion sizes were huge and made for sharing. But we still found room for the banana toffee pudding. Incredible, and worth a return visit on its own. Might be too rich for some - but can that be a bad thing?  This place is worth the stars.",

It was a sprinkling of graham cracker crumbs on the bottom of a skillet, (not a crust-mind you), with minimal chocolate on top and a crap load of marshmallows. Yuck.  Other than that, not bad. Service was good. The guy at the front was super nice and even opened the door for us on the way out :)",

The street corn was my favorite. The fatty in me wishes the waffles came with syrup. The tartare was good but not memorable, and the s'mores were the perfect ending to the meal.  I also tried the mango and lychee sangria. Perfectly sweetened and strong from the grand mariner.   I would definitely pick this spot again for something to snack on downtown!",

The Oxtail Empanadas YUM, Super Mac a great creamy dish, Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider awesome, French Dip Sandwich too many items to mention.  My FAVORITE item had to be the Carrot Cake Dessert with Brown Butter Cinnamon Ice Cream.  I am not a drinker at all BUT the \"Fuhgettaboudet was so good I almost drank it in two giant gulps!  Also the Smash was great and the Deal Maker.  My server's name was Michael a young man that took care of our every need with such a great attitude made the experience that much more.  I would recommend this restaurant to many and have been back to try other items.  Keep up the good work guys!!!",

Pig ears & Oxtail empanadas are just two of the many \"Chef driven\" offerings.  I'll definitely be returning to to try the remainder of the menu.",

    "text": "This place had so many good reviews I don't know what happened the night I visited.  We first had a seat at the bar to wait for the rest of our party.  The Smash I ordered was fine, just like a nice refreshing mojito with Bourbon.  But the drink my girl ordered was definitely made incorrectly.  She ordered a frozen drink, but it was more of a meal since she needed a spoon to actually drink it with the huge chunks of ice.  I'll give the bartender the benefit of the doubt since he was obviously new and was reading the ingredient list as he was making it.  But even I knew you had to blend the drink for more than 10 seconds.    We decided to see if they could make something simple so we ordered a Jameson Ginger.  You cant' mess that up... Yes you can if you put all ginger ale and barely any Jameson.  I went back to ask for a bit more Jameson but he said it was standard pour and would charge me for another shot.  I was pretty surprised as we saw him make the drink right in front of us and he might as well has forgotten to put the whiskey in it.  This night was not starting out well.  We were sat 15 minutes later, around 8:00pm.  We didn't get our food until 9:20pm.  Even drinks were a difficult to get at our table as we watched them sitting at the bar, ready to be served.  We watched a family next to us leave after not being served after a while.  We were lucky we were in good company or else we would have definitely got up and left.  I ordered the Ricky Ricardo sandwich.  They should have just called it a Dijon Mustard sandwich because that's all I could taste.  The plantains were the best part of the dish.  Do not order that!  The Oxtail Empanadas were not memorable.  All night we had to flag down our server and we had wagers on the Over/Under on the time we would get our food/drinks.  The OVER won 9 times out of 10.    I will not be returning to this establishment.  Whether they were understaffed that night or chef's were having an off night, this experience was one of the worse dining experiences I have had in a long time.  Usually Yelp reviews have steered us in the right direction but something was off with this experience.",

A gem of a restaurant with a great wait staff, bar, food and hip ambiance that rivals a lot of the higher costing restaurants on the main part of the strip.  Went to dinner here with my sister and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly! I had the Sliced chimichurri steak and my sis had the Barramundi filet. Both cooked to perfection and the drinks from the mixologist were delicious also!  Definitely coming back! When you come, have a good time, enjoy, and relax!  Just wanted to add that Georgie was our server that night and she helped my lil sister's visit pretty awesome! Be sure to ask for her and treat her kindly!

My husband had the pulled pork sliders and had nothing but good things to say. I too had sliders but aimed for the white fish....not my favorite fish. Very fishy flavor and not something I ended up being able to finish, which was unfortunate. We also added on the truffle fries...which tasted like completely regular fries so choose wisely there friends. Overall, I think I'll keep exploring the local eats in this part of town but wouldn't say no to going back someday and giving it another go.",

Also, after we made the reservation, we called and they couldn't find it (despite giving them a credit card), so we made another reservation. The day before, they called to confirm both, but thankfully we were able to cancel the duplicated one.",

    "text": "It's been about a month since I was in here, but I'm definitely impressed by this place. I love the name! It still just makes me giggle.   My mom, my brother, and I were walking down Fremont Street when we got toward the end. It was insanely hot outside. Imagine that, Vegas being warm! Lol. Anyway, my brother and I were going to walk back to find the car and pick my mother up.   We left her here, at Therapy. This made for a hilarious joke! My brother and I annoyed her so damn bad, that she had to go get therapy, and a few drinks to make it through the rest of the day with us. Just kidding, but we did tell people this.   We left here here for approximately half an hour. She found a spot by the window, so we could just drive up and pick her up. Gave her money in case she really did want to drink while we were gone.   The staff were super sweet to her while she was there. They didn't mind she wanted to sit by the window while she waited. They brought her water, even adding extra ice after she requested it. They didn't seem worried about her that she wasn't ordering anything. They were more than happy to let her get out of the Vegas heat and simply hang out while she waited for us.   I'm not really one to go into a business like this if I'm not planning on buying anything. A business is there to make money, so someone taking up a table and not ordering anything basically costs them money. Is it the nice thing to do? Absolutely. I'm always impressed by a business that can look at something like that from a personal standpoint, versus a cold business standpoint. I wouldn't do it again, but I appreciated the fact they let my mother get off her feet for a bit (she's not too steady on her feet, which is why we went to find the car and left her there to rest) and just get some water in her and cool down from the heat.   It is a place that deserves both my business and recognition for being so kind to my elderly mother. It makes me love it that much more, and the next time I am in Vegas, I will make it a point to stop in and try some of their food and drinks.   Review 89 of 2017.",

We said we'd actually be there about 30 min early, asked could they seat us then. The host laughed and said they'd see... when we got the the place was busy but had plenty of tables available. We were seated immediately by (presumably) a different employee.   The food is either family style with tapas small plates or they also have individual plates as well. We decided to go the tapas route, and ordered the Pesto Chicken Meatballs, Seared Brussel Sprouts, Oxtail Empanadas, & Tuna Tartare. They were all good but honestly the brussel sprouts were my fave. The kitchen forgot to bring us out the chicken meatballs so they came out late--after some prompting. Our waitress felt so bad, we got a Carrot Cake on the house.   If you're coming here for drinks, they're a little pricey.. $13 on average for a mixed drink. Which, to me, is a little steep for not being on the strip. They were tasty though. The Smash was delicious! The Life's A Peachy was too syrupy sweet for my taste, but reminded me of a sweet wine cooler. They have an impressive whiskey and wine list, as well as a decent beer selection.   Overall, the food & drinks here were good and the atmosphere was surprisingly nice. One of the nicest sit down restaurants in the area, as far as ambience goes. Although the host we initially spoke with on the phone was a little rude, everyone once we arrived was very helpful and polite. I'd come back here.",

So the good folks of Therapy make this chicken and red velvet waffles slider dish... go ahead and get that because it is delicious! I never knew how important red velvet waffles were until I had them.   They are typically served with the slaw on the sandwich, but I opted to have them on the side just in case the flavors clashed - they definitely didn't and I definitely ended up adding it to my slider. The chicken was perfectly fried crispy on the outside.   I also ordered a side of french fries. Typical quality bar fries but also complimented the red velvet waffle fried chicken extravaganza well.   I do not recall the beer selection being anything to freak out about... but at least they have a selection I guess. The atmosphere is very chill... the staff didn't seem rush-y or anything... but not exactly super welcoming at first. Maybe because we stormed in as if we had been stranded outside with no water for a year... I'm not sure.   Definitely worth stopping by and grabbing a bite. I'd recommend making a dinner night of it.  *2017 Yelp Review Challenge: 8/100*",

We waited only a few minutes for a table and then we were sat upstairs and Jen was our waitress. She was very friendly and even though she seemed to have all the tables upstairs and a large party she was awesome! Wait time for drinks from the bar and food was a little long, but they were packed. All in all food and drinks were worth the wait but the service is what will bring us back!! Thanks Jen see you again soon!!!!",

Therapy reminded both of us of our favorite place back in Fort Collins that is laid back and inviting. We didn't get a chance to try the food but we will next time! We will definitely be back. Great drinks and service!",

Our server, JoAnne, was fabulous, and of great assistance in making cocktail decisions, as our already stressed tolerance for alcohol limited us to one cocktail each.",

Our bill with tax was $95 which seemed high for the amount of food we got. The crab and artichoke dip and Brussels sprouts were good. The rest of the dishes were not great. The sliders were a disappointment. All in all it was just ok.",

    "text": "We stumbled on this place looking for somewhere new to try... We actually went to a spot next door... We walked in and sat down an NO one even acknowledged us when we walked in and and for the 2 minutes we were there...that menu was very small and we were not feeling it. We walked out and was reading the menu for Therapy posted outside. Jason opened the door and came out to talk to us.... Asked us if we were locals... And we told him yes that we were wanting to try some restaurants downtown but were undecided... He mentioned a Thai spot across the St...but said that if wanted to try something different that their restaurant was Zagat rated... And said some other great things about Therapy.  We told him thanks and we would consider it.  He was very cordial... Not pushy and went back inside.  My husband and I were still undecided... But because of the way that Jason approached us about his restaurant... We had to try it!! We walked in and were taken by surprise on how unexpectedly nice the atmosphere was.   Upscale.. Perfect lighting and noise level... Loved the way the seating was arranged and the colors used.   We tried a couple of drinks.. Had the best Caesar salad I've ever had, oxtail empanadas with a dipping sauce that came from heaven.... Wanted to dip everything in it!  We ordered the braised short ribs which just melted in your mouth... And  the steak with a delicious mouth watering chimichuri sauce...both were so fricken good!!!!  Portions were just right ... we were not overly full and had room for dessert. My husband ordered carrot cake... I am not a carrot cake person....but omg....  When they brought it to our table, I got so excited!! The presentation of it was not a carrot cake at all!!! This dessert was sooooooo out of this world good!! The cake was unexplainable... Very moist and almost chewy like a brownie.... The manager, also a great guy.... Explained that you should eat all the parts together... Some cake... A little bit of the cream cheese whip cream and a little bit of the ice cream... (I think he said it was browned butter ice cream.... Yes please!! ) Wow!! The flavors and the texture together were perfect!!! I am now a fan of THAT carrot cake only!!!! I need to go back for more!!!! Such a great place!!",

We couldn't leave without dessert, we ordered 3 of the 4 and they are not recommended.  Will be going back to see if they are consistent with the food and maybe something new on the menu.

We got the bacon wrapped dates and chicken meatballs to start, the meats balls were super dry, and the dates were awful, they tasted so dried out not even the sauce they can in could help them.  The service grade was a C. Then we waited for 25 mins before our entrees came out. Mac and cheese w bacon and the roasted chicken. Chicken was super dried out, and Mac and cheese was a mediocre overpriced dish.  Really disappointed and unimpressed.  However the look and vibe is a cool. It's a cute little hipster spot. Would not recommend and won't return. You won't get your money's worth w this place.",

    "text": "My husband was browsing the internet and came across a review of the restaurant. Oxtail empanadas had his attention! So we tried this place on a Friday night around 4:30 pm. Walking into the place, we could hear EWF playing...positive sign #1! We were also greeted and seated by the assistant manager and he was awesome...very friendly and welcoming to the establishment.  Initially we thought this place might be a bit cold and pretentious just from the industrial-like interior design, but once we were inside, I really liked the place. It had a nice, intimate-type of feel and the chairs we were seated in were very comfy! We were seated in the middle row of tables. Our server was doubling as the bartender also and she was great! Very attentive and friendly. Positive sign #2!  We shared the The Perfect Cure, Devils on Horseback, Oxtail Empanadas and Fire Roasted Street Corn. I absolutely LOVED the Devils on Horseback (almond and truffle goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon in romesco sauce)! The bacon was nice and crisp and it tasted wonderful. The street corn had a great lime flavor I was digging as well. The oxtail empanadas were a bit smaller than we anticipated, but they were delicious. And the Perfect Cure which is a selection of cured meats and cheeses hit the spot though I do wish they served it with more than 4 slices of bread. The food was great and it was just enough that we weren't feeling like we were going to explode from dinner. Positive sign #3!  For dessert we had the Cast Iron S'mores. It was perfect for two people to share. We had the option of ordering it with bacon, so of course we did! I've never been a really big fan of s'mores because sometimes it can be too sweet for my taste, but I would definitely order this again. The chocolate and bacon joined with the toasted marshmallow goodness and graham cracker crust was so delicious! Positive Sign #4!  For drinks, we ordered The Smash! and White Peach Pisco Punch. My husband really enjoyed the pisco punch and I liked my drink as well though I think I would've liked his pisco punch a bit more. We also ordered coffee with our dessert. The coffee was a tad weak, but drinkable. We take our coffee black and would've liked a stronger coffee taste. But it's not a dealbreaker! :)  Atmosphere - the music was on point the entire duration of dinner...we like our old school (EWF, Commodores, Carl Carlton, Billy Paul, Gap Band, etc.)! It made for a very relaxing and laid back atmosphere which we really liked. We also met the restaurant owner/manager who stopped by our table several times to drop off some of the plates we ordered and also welcomed us to the restaurant. My husband made a point to let him know how much he enjoyed the music selection they had going at the time. Lol. The owner seemed to appreciate hearing that. Positive sign #5!   Everyone was very friendly. The service was great and the food was great too. Loved the music during dinner and it wasn't played overly loud either. I will definitely be coming back with my husband. The owner said that for the winter, they will be launching a new menu within the next few weeks, so I am excited to see what they will be offering! I hope this place sticks around. They've been open since around July.",

We sampled a variety of items in a tasting menu, including chicken meatballs in an INCREDIBLE jalapeno cilantro pesto that I am still dreaming about. The meatballs themselves were a bit dry, but the sauce was so delicious! Next was a crostini with ricotta, truffled fig jam, cranberries, almonds and walnuts - very rich, and very delicious. The last item was a take on fried chicken and waffles. The waffle was red velvet, accompanied by a red pepper remoulade slaw and vanilla maple  syrup. For the record - I do not like chicken and waffles or red velvet cake, so initially I did not anticipate liking this dish. I was pleasantly surprised beyond words. The buttermilk fried chicken was perfect. The waffle was crisp and not overwhelming in flavor. The slaw with red pepper remoulade was OUTSTANDING, beyond my wildest expectations. I would come here just to try this dish again. The staff were accommodating and personable. A delightful surprise.",

Place was dead, maybe three tables occupied  Parked a block away for $2/hr  Service was really SLOW. 30 min to get our food  We got the chicken and waffles (which was the only picture we looked at before deciding) and the wagyu burger.  The menu is limited. Most are side items and not really a lunch dish in my opinion. $10 Brussels sprouts, $12 crab dip, you get the idea.  Maybe it's better in the evening. With 1200 reviews and features on the food network I'd expect better!",

We came for a birthday celebration, made reservations a week in advance and I checked in with the hostess confirming it was for a birthday and she said she knew and they would do something special. If the something special was messing up our order, serving food that was boring and uninspired, never coming by to see if we needed more drinks or anything else, and completely forgetting the birthday person's meal, then they certainly did do something special.  It isn't an experience I'll soon forget and I was totally embarrassed. This place used to be packed to the brim. They have gone totally downhill. The chef and owner should be embarrassed.",

    "text": "Went here with my Fiance last night and was greeted (LOL ) by a waitress who looked at us with distain. She had dark hair, I believe green eyes and was quite petite. The one star is based off the service we received, or rather didn't receive. We stood waiting around for a while before the girl over behind the bar paid us any attention and made her way over to us. She immediately told us that a large party was coming soon and that she really didn't have room for us. Oh FYI the place was empty!!! Only one party, of I believe 5 people in the booth behind the hostess stand. She said she could put us at the bar if we \"really wanted.\" Like what is that? If we really want? I mean we're here.   We picked out where we would dine based off of the reviews we read on Yelp. To be basically told we really don't want you here by a waitress who clearly had no interest in doing her job, was kind of a slap to the face. After nearly begging her for a regular seat she was like, \"well . . . I mean as long as you guys don't take too long.\" I told her we just wanted a quick bite and that we had plans. She begrudgingly said, \"okay\" with about the same enthusiasm as a child who had agreed to eat their spinach. She seated us right by the window and gave us menus. I later had to signal her that we were ready to order. The food came out hot and straight out of the kitchen. If this review was based just on the food it would have to be 5 stars. We ordered the fried Mac'n Cheese and the Wagu burger and shared both. The food was fantastic! Absolutely perfection but felt very rushed to eat as fast as possible so we could free up our two prized seats. We were there a total of 45 minutes. I had to flag her down for our check. Honestly it's such a shame the service was so bad . . . The food was so good but the service was so awful it just really turned us off from wanting to come back. We are here a lot for work trips so it's such a bummer this place doesn't hire better staff and train them to be kind and positive. Her negativity and hostility was contagious and it left a bitter note on the first half of our evening. We dine out a lot and I have to say their is nothing worse then a rude waitress. Hell, I can even bare standard food but cannot stand poor service. We normally tip far above gratuity but after being treated like dirt we paid the minimum 22% because we were so unhappy with our service. If the restaurant was really booked out then she could have just told us, \"I'm so sorry but we are booked.\" It would have been better to just come another night then to be treated like characters out of Oliver Twist, pleading to pay for services that the restaurant doesn't wish to give. Oh and we never saw the \"Big Party\" show up, we then walked Fremont street down to the very end and came back to get our car and did not see the place packed.",

The cashews and mustard in the dish were okay, but the quantity of oil was off-putting. My husband got the signature salad, and it was fine, though quite common.   Several of the items were labeled as gluten-free, which was helpful. Many seemed fried and/or heavy, so if that's the food you're seeking, this could be good.  The 3 screens were playing college basketball, an old NFL game, and 8 tweets about the restaurant on loop. Other than that, the setup was good. Our server was very attentive, and the location in Fremont was good.",

    "text": "We really enjoyed this restaurant. It has a cool trendy vibe and food to match. We came at 6:30 on a Friday and were seated right away with no reservation.  They have their gluten-free dishes itemized, which was nice for my bae who eats GF. Options include their signature salad, beets by therapy salad, Brussels sprouts, crab dip, short ribs, hunters chicken, pork chop and filet mignon. They also have vegan items pointed out, but there are just 2 of them.  We tried the truffle fries. I'm not a big fan of truffle and I thought there was just enough truffle oil. My bae who LOVES truffle says they were good but lacked enough truffle flavor. Take form that what you will. Every fry was eaten regardless.  The \"devils on horseback\" is their bacon wrapped dates. They were pretty basic for me, nothing special from what I've had elsewhere. They were yummy as bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese always are.   The crab dip was a highlight for me. I couldn't stop eating it. I agree that it's probably not lump crab, or if it started as lump crab then they flaked it. In any event, the dish is creamy and delicious and full of crab flavor.   The pork chop was thick but a little dry. We weren't a fan of the mustard potato mash. Next time I come I'm going to try a different entre.   This is my first time here and I like what I found. The couple beside us seem to have come before and we're complaining that things weren't as good. Especially something about the brussel sprouts not having the mustard and cheese. The hostess did mention that they redid their menu.   We dug right in so I only have a pic of the menu and the pork chop.",

Portions were decent for the pricing. When it all arrives it beautiful and I am salivating with excitement. I take my first bite and it literally tasted like nothing?! I look at the hubby to see his reaction upon his first bite and he is also underwhelmed. It was cooked perfectly but very under seasoned in every way. It had the correct textures but absolutely no flavor, no red velvet sweetness, there was no saltiness from the chicken and there no maple or vanilla flavors. I have never tasted maple syrup that was lacking in flavor, Daphuk?! I dowsed the syrup on top with hopes that if I added more I could get some additional flavor. Nothing, it was not even aromatic. It was strange and I'm still perplexed. It was so blah we split just the half and boxed up the other for a homeless man we saw down the street for some nutrition. On the upside, the Brussel sprout were sensational!!! So good we scraped the bowl clean. It had Parmesan shaving and the cashews added a really nice texture. Bourbon smash was decent. Service was ok, efficient but not memorable.",

I'm an Argentinian American and my mother always made empanadas. They have these spicy chorizo empanadas here that are ridic! Sorry mom, but wow! Sausage with green and red bell peppers with some sort of magical semi spicy sauce.   The braised pork belly! I've never knew how juicy and tender the meat could possibly until I had it here. The meat just slips right thru the knife and melts in your mouth. I think there's some mushroom sauce with the mashed potatoes too!   The \"BiG Sexy\" is my go to right now! I think it's a wagyu beef. No idea what kind that is, but I like it! Brie cheese with some roasted tomato too. Medium rare cooked to perfection. Damn it's a good burger!   2. The space and atmosphere is cool AF. Industrial type place. With some good music and not too dim lighting and open kitchen.  It's just a cool place to have some dinner and drinks. It's cool! I love it so much I come here by myself now and eat in the corner and people watch through the window wall facing Fremont.   3. The location! It's prime in the heart of downtown! I love it! Just moved to downtown a few months ago and there isn't any other place like this here! I eat. I drink. Maybe bar hop on occasion after when the 7 friends I have wanna hang out. Ok. I lied. I have 6 friends.   4. The pricing is perfect! It won't break your bank, but this isn't a fast food joint either.  Food is just as good as some nice restaurants on the strip. Not like I dine inside the Wynn all the time, but I do go out for birthday dinners 6 times out of the year.  7 dinners if I include my birthday dinner.   5. The people who work here have some good positive energy.  It shows. It's contagious. I like surrounding myself around good people. They can take my money. It's worth it!",

    "text": "After many trips to Vegas, I finally ventured into the downtown area to grab dinner at Therapy. The restaurant sports a very clean and modern look with plenty of open space. We were seated in the upstairs dining area, which offered the perfect perspective to appreciate the design of the place.  The staff was very accommodating and had no problems making a change to our order after it was placed. We decided to go with a few options from the sharables \"The Social Club\" portion of the menu. The dishes were a bit on the pricey side, but they were also very tasty.  FOOD Oxtail empanadas: These were so moist and delicious. I only wish there were more of them for me to devour. My girlfriend and I had to split four empanadas between us.  Super mac (with bacon): This was some of the best mac and cheese that I've had in a long time. It was pure cheesy heaven! And even more so than with the empanadas, I really do think the portion size of this dish needed to be larger. I could have easily eaten the whole dish by myself.  Chicken and red velvet waffle sliders: This was yet another amazing dish. The chicken was especially juicy and the waffles actually tasted like red velvet cake. There could have been more syrup provided though.  Charred kale salad: This was the only dish that we didn't particularly enjoy.  DRINKS  The Smash!: According to the waitress, this is the most popular cocktail. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed. There was a certain bland, watery aftertaste to the drink.",

Even though they were booked out with reservations (which we did not have) they were very accommodating and sat us within 5 mins. Atmosphere was trendy but comfortable. The food had a bit of flair...typical pub food but with a nice twist.  The small plates were definitely sizeable...there were three of us and we ordered 4 of them to share, as well as salads for ourselves.  And we had too much food.  The brussel sprouts were amazing...the bacon pieces plentiful and the sweet apple was a nice touch.  Our waiter Michael was super attentive and very helpful with the menu.

I'm not a chicken and waffle person, so I reluctantly tried the red velvet waffles with fried chicken, and I was blown away (I'm drooling just thinking of it.). We also had the empanada trio, which I highly recommend.  For dessert we tried the chocolate banana bread pudding, which was good, and the deconstructed carrot cake, which was da bomb! Beyond the excellent food, the drinks were top shelf. The pina colada was hands down, the best I've ever had! If you find yourself in old Vegas, Go, you won't be sorry!",

    "text": "It's unfortunate that Daniel Ontiveros left, but if the new executive chef can lead the kitchen as well as his predecessor, Therapy will continue to be a quality spot Downtown and is already one of the most beautiful spaces in the area. They spent a pretty penny on this build out and the quality shows. More upscale than surrounding restaurants but still a casual environment perfect for hanging out with friends or for a date night.   I stopped by a couple times earlier in the summer and both visits showcased well crafted dishes where the smaller, shareable plates shined. They have some classic dishes like steak tartare made with hangar steak and chicken and waffles using crisp and airy red velvet waffles. Latin inspired dishes can be found on the menu. Street corn charred and smothered with cheese, a lime aioli and a subtle kick from chili peppers makes for some good bites. As do savory, rich, and slightly oily oxtail empanadas or an order of shrimp ceviche and chips.  The most successful items were also the most unique. Fried pig ears were a first for me, but I walked away a fan of its crispy exterior and chewy (almost like biting into a fig) texture. Their \"In the gnudi\" dish was also a hit. Although slightly sweet with a fig jam and cranberries, spreading the baked ricotta and topping on top of the accompanying walnut crostini created an enticing array of tastes and textures.  Both flatbreads I tried -- the summer squash and mixed mushroom flatbreads -- were equally outstanding where the buttery, flakey pastry-like crust stood out as the star of both dishes.  The biggest letdowns were the limp popcorn and salty and dry chicken meatballs. Aside from those missteps I'd have to say that Therapy has lots of promise, provided that the changes in the kitchen don't hold them back.",

My husband wasn't a fan of that and was talking with the hostess about other options. She recommended a different sauce. When we ordered the waitress said that they aren't able to take the dijoinaise off since it was a pre-made sandwich. Pre-made!? And why was this recommended by another employee. My husband figured out a different option for dinner. After we ordered, the manager came over to apologize and to our surprise it was the hostess!!!! The hostess that recommended us order the sandwich different. But then the cook couldn't accommodate. She apologized. There should NEVER be a time that a condiment on a sandwich isn't able to be taken off. This is not a deli.  While sitting and eating our food we heard the table next to us having an issue as well and management coming over. There should never be an argument with the customer. Never. Sad. Not to mention the time from order to table was over 20 minutes.  When the bill arrived nothing was taken care of. We weren't looking for a comp but something should have been done.",

Crab dip was good but I burned the roof my mouth trying to eat it too fast. Ok let's talk about the signature salad. Yep loved that too. All thanks to Yesenia! She suggested a variety of dishes which made the experience awesome for me and my friends. Gotta try it.",

    "text": "It was a Sunday afternoon, 2:04pm, HAPPY HOUR. Found this place online an hour before we arrived - the menu peaked our interest!  Upon entering, we were greeted and seated (@ the bar). The HAPPY HOUR menu was awesome - 20% off the menu and tons of drink specials! Even if it wasn't HAPPY HOUR, the prices were way wallet-friendly!   We ordered 3 mouth watering dishes thanks to the Yelp reviews we read - 2 appetizers and 1 sandwich. The 1st dish was the oxtail empanadas - the oxtail filling had the perfect blend of meat, sauce and spices tucked into a firm and not oily shell. The sauce that accompanied the empanadas gave it a I-SHOULD-ORDER-ANOTHER-ROUND taste. The 2nd dish is called IN THE GNUDI. Damn! My tastebuds were on cloud 10!! I'm not even going to describe it, so just read the ingredients and you decide. At this point we (2 of us) were pretty stuffed and satisfied. The 3rd dish was the Ricky Ricardo, a Cuban sandwich. It was recommended to us that you take a bite of the sandwich, then a bite of the plantains, and lastly add the plantains and pickled veggies to the sandwich...great idea!   Lastly, the service was Uber friendly. Thank you to our bartender, Troy, no Todd lol, for being such an attentive and passionate foodie. We will be back!",

I had previously been in here once during the evening when it had just opened up to the public, but this was the first time I had been inside during the day.  It's beautiful both during the day and night. The ambience is very classy urban. Almost as if you're stepping into a classy New York apartment type atmosphere in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. If you look up when you get inside, you'll know what I mean :)   There is a bar to your right, a dining room to your left and an upper floor dining room as well. We sat at the bar and were fortunate enough to get there during their happy hour (2pm-5pm that day) and were served by a friendly bartender. Their food looks a bit pricey, however when they come out the presentation is very well done and the craft of the food is absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend trying this place out!  (And hey, you can't go wrong with trying it out during happy hour for food and drinks!)",

Me and my friend came for brunch. It wasn't very busy.   There were many TVs behind the bar so you are able to watch sports as you dine. We had a waiter who looked just like Terrence Jenkins (E! News). He was awesome, very informative and attentive.   We had oxtail empanadas, those were uhmazingggg! They had this spicy aioli sauce which were bomb dot com. We got the Mac N Cheese, which were so good. Very cheesy but not over powering. We also got the pretzel bread which were our favorite. Very addicting.  The sizes of the plates are pretty small, kinda like a tapas style place. I loved it though and will be returning!",

The prices are a little bit more expensive than most downtown spots but definitely higher quality ingredients.  For starters we shared the oxtail empanadas. I really enjoyed these but the sauce overall made the dish. For entrees we had the pulled pork sliders and chicken & waffle sliders. The chicken & waffles was my favorite, just the right amount of ingredients and the sweetness wasn't too overpowering. The pulled pork I thought was just eh alright.  Overall this place was a great find but my reason for the four star was the fact that the mushroom flatbread was no longer on the menu :( I was really looking forward to trying it. Oh well though, still a nice dinner.",

    "text": "So let me start by saying that initially I was never going to come here, even though I won a basket that included a gift card for here, the restaurant is located downtown Las Vegas which isn't near my home nor do I ever intentionally come to down town.  However we had an event in this restaurant over the weekend and they were serving their entire appetizer menu, which was absolutely delicious. I decided to come by for lunch and brought my boss to use the gift card.  I ordered the empanadas app, because it was delicious on sat, I wanted to also order the chicken meatballs, which were equally as appealing, but I refrained.  We both ordered sandwiches, I the French dip and my boss the Ricky Ricardo.  Both were very delicious!  My French dip was very very good, the cheese was melted with the horseradish, YUMMY!!  The chips that came with it were delicious and not too salty!  I would give it 5 stars on food and service our waitress was very friendly and helpful her name was Yesenia, the ceiling fans were blowing a constant wind that was 4-5 knots, creating an icebox atmospheres well as causing my nose to run.  Otherwise I highly recommend.",

About 20 items.  Sadly, only a few stood out as things I would get again. The star for me was the French Dip with Truffle Chips. I also enjoyed the Fried Pig's Ears and the Hanger Steak Tartare. The rest of the spread were more like a \"one and done\" kind of deal.  TASTE is first and foremost, and while the presentations were appealing to the eye, I don't see wanting to return any time soon. Glad we got to try it out though, and it seems to be doing great for DTLV's dining scene. ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter: \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  3",

    "text": "I'm a local who visited Therapy for the first time this week for lunch (after having eaten at many/most of the places downtown). First, service & atmosphere were great. Coffee was great- some of the best I've had. My dining companion had the salmon, which she said was amazing-- although for $19, the portion seemed a bit small.  Unfortunately, I was NOT a big fan of the \"Charred\" Kale Salad. Kale was sauteed, not really charred (and I've had charred spinach and kale at other restaurants so I had some expectations about how it would be prepared). It was not cut into manageable pieces and was chewy. Very hard to eat (thank goodness I was eating with a friend and not on a date). And I think I counted about 4-5 small beets in the entire salad. Would not order again.",

The mixture they use was really thick and the bartender pretty much filled the whole glass with it and nothing else! I kept adding water to it bug it was just gross. The food was just as bad. We got the french dip which was way over cooked and bland. The truffle chips was actually the best thing in the dish. I got the pretzel sticks which was ok and the Big Sexy: wagyu burger with brie and pickled tomatoes cooked medium. Of course my burger didn't come out till after my friend already finished his meal! And the dude next to me who came in 20 min after me finished his meal! Over cooked dry and hard patty. Bun was also dry....only good was the pickled tomatoes! The burger was so dry it got stuck in my throat and had to wash it down with water cuz my bloody mary was too thick to drink! Total waste! Giving it 2 stars cuz the bartender was nice and the truffle chips were good. Never coming back and not recommending.",

The only reason I rate so low is there's nothing I loathe more than walking into an establishment for eating at 1030pm and hearing a \"dj\" who 1) has absolutely ZERO idea what hes doing. 2) Is playing music nowhere near conducive to the mood of dining room. 3) Continously playing a drop of his \"dj name\" DJ TOXIC to let the 6 people who were probably so hungry they overlooked the terrible music selection, inability to properly mix two songs together and masculine inadequate-ness to keep playing his name drop. IM HUNGRY (and most women in my life already tell me im hard of hearing, i dont need to be made completely deaf) Dont get me wrong, the food, service and room were tip top. Im just curious if youd hire servers, cooks and bartenders with ZERO experience much less a clue of what theyre doing, why youd hire a DJ of the same skill set.",

    "text": "Went in for a dinner tonight with my sister based on an article in a local magazine, our desire to try a new spot in town, and my knowledge of Chef Daniel Ontiveros and his super skills. Was able to make a reservation in the afternoon and were seated right away even though we showed up a bit early. The build out is extremely well done. One of the best new projects I've seen in the revitalization of Downtown. Trendy but still really comfortable. Our amazing server, Kyrsten, was helpful and answered all of our questions, making some recommendations but giving us plenty of time to talk out the menu and make up our minds. We liked a number of items on the menu and decided to do a tapas style share of everything we ordered and Kyrsten was super accommodating about it. We had the Oxtail Empanadas, Fire Roasted Corn, In the Gnudi ricotta bites, and Shrimp Scampi. As 3 of our 4 choices were apps or from the \"Social\" (or meant to be shared) portion of the menu, Kyrsten suggested we space them out so they didn't all arrive at once which we appreciated. The oxtail had great flavor and the wrappers were fried just right-not too hard or chewy. The corn was charred perfectly and though my sister requested to have the corn shaved off the cob and was told the kitchen wouldn't do it-it was so good she wasn't upset at having to eat it off the cob. The Gnudi was AHHmazing. It's a lighter and much more flavorful cousin to a gnocchi with a sauce that Chef Daniel outdid himself with! Just the right amount of sweet and savory all in one bite! We finished the meal sharing the smore's-I'm not a fan of smore's in general but wanted to taste everything. I made my sister give me my full half! It's sooo good! REAL marshmallows-not fluff, not bagged, but real, I'm assuming in-house homemade marshmallows browned to a satisfying crunch on top of a rich chocolate layer and a graham crumble. YUM!!  I would recommend coming down just to sit at the bar and have a late night dessert and drink if the rest of the sweets are as good as that one. I will say that I feel that the $$ price per person rating does not reflect a full dining experience here. Unless you only come in and have a non alcoholic drink and a sandwich/burger expect to pay more than 20 bucks a person. Our 4 shared plates tonight with no booze on our tab was $68 before tax and gratuity. I'm a local born and bred and have worked in the food industry for years so I have no problem paying for good food; just be prepared that you can easily drop $100 on a two person tab in this place. If there were any \"kinks\" or \"hiccups\" in their opening week or so, I believe they've worked them out because we experienced no issues. I fully enjoyed my first visit to Therapy and will return and recommend it to friends and visitors alike.",

Not in the \"I'm a hipster and so I think being gluten free is cool even though I don't know what gluten is,\" but in the actual \"has weird body reactions can't process gluten\" type of gluten-free. Therapy has many gluten-free options so we decided to go there. WELLLLL my peeps, she orders an entree CLEARLY MARKED GLUTEN-FREE and then when our food is about to come out, our server asks whether my friend is actually gluten-free BECAUSE THE SAUCE IN THEIR GLUTEN-FREE DISH HAS GLUTEN. This was after my friend confirmed before ordering that the entree was entirely gluten-free. So, that's a MUY BIG PROBLEMO, seeing as how you're representing that a dish does not contain a certain ingredient, but in fact it does. And that certain ingredient can cause health repercussions. Can someone say lawsuit? I mean, would you say that a dish doesn't contain nuts (for the nut allergy peeps) and then later when the food is about to come out ask if it's okay that it has nuts?? NO WAY JOSE. That would be a personal injury attorney's dream. And then, their solution is that my friend eat it without the sauce bc \"it's still juicy\" and the other entree she tried to order would take 30 mins. I CANT EVEN. Also, it was not juicy and it was bland. So bye Felicia. That's my story. /endvent  The good part: the drinks are good and my food was good but overpriced f'sho. I'm just glad I'm not gluten intolerant.",

They open at 11:30 am, and by noon they are almost at capacity. We were seated in one of their comfy booths and ordered drinks from our friendly server while we waited for the rest of the party to arrive.   The lunch menu is limited to sandwiches/burgers, a few salads, and some signature dishes. I am not really a fan of chowing down a burger while trying to carry on a professional conversation, and that along with sandwiches seemed to be the primary focus of the menu. I saw the sign outside claiming \"award winning\" oxtail empanadas. I am starting to quickly learn that \"award winning\" anything on a menu will not meet the expeactions and the oxtail empenada were no exception.  I opted for the burger and it was just a burger. The highlight was my husband's chicken and red velvet waffle slider. It sounds odd but it was a great combination of flavors that made for a delicious, hearty option.  I will keep this place in the rotation for business lunches in the downtown area.",

    "text": "What a terrible dining experience!  So it's a weeknight, and most of Vegas is pretty quiet (no major events going on.)  So the wife and I set up an 8pm reservation at Therapy.  Our Uber dropped us off at 7:45, so we went up to check in.  The hostess asked our name and reservation time, and then replied (with TONS of attitude), \"There's no tables now - we still have 15 minutes!\"  Ok, we were just checking in.  We'll hang out front and people watch.  Well, 8pm comes and goes, and now its closer to 8:15.  So we wait for the mean hostess to head inside, and ask another one what the status of our table was.  When she realized they were late and heard what was said to us previously, she immediately took us into the bar and comp'd us drinks.  SWEET!  Unfortunately, this is the last positive thing that happened.  So we're now hanging in the bar, getting a little buzzed on empty stomachs, and after having several waitresses ask us if we'd been helped yet, and hearing that we had reservations, we FINALLY were seated at 8:45pm.  Our new waitress came up and took our order, along with another drink order (since our drinks were long since gone), and brought us our drinks rather quickly.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Every 10 minutes or so, another table would get a single plate.  The table next to us (a lady and her son) were in the same boat as us, and eventually they paid their tab and left after receiving just 1 or 2 items.  FINALLY, at 9:40pm, we received our first plate!  We scarfed it down, and then around every 5-10 minutes, another plate would come out.  I'm estimating this, because by now, I was pretty wasted after drinking for 2 hours on an empty stomach.  The food was mediocre honestly - roast beef french dip was bland, crab dip was boring, the charred brussel sprouts were fine but forgettable, the \"in the gnudi\" was frankly inedible (we left over half of it behind.)  In fact, the only thing we REALLY liked was the \"devils on horseback\" (goat cheese and almon stuffed dates), and it was the first plate that came out, so who knows if we were just so drunk and hungry that ANYTHING would have tasted good at that point.  The bartender was nice, but the wait staff was overworked and stressed out.  And while the main hostess was nice, her assistance was perhaps the most rude hostess I've ever met (we listened to her give attitude to other people too - it wasn't just us.)  In the end, there were no redeeming qualities for this establishment.  Don't ever come here.  There are too many good places to eat in Vegas (even within walking distance of Therapy) to support a business like this.",

    "text": "\"At least she's pretty\" is what comes to mind when describing this highly anticipated bookmark check. The decor outshines the food with that downtown-esque ambition. But it is very pretty inside.  Chicken Meatballs - good with Indian overtones and a nice way to begin our meal.  The Ricky Ricardo aka Cuban pulled pork sandwich was ok, plaintains weren't as sweet as I like, pickles were good.  The Chicken & Red Velvet Waffles were surprisingly much larger than slider portions so a good value at $14. The chicken had a prominent & well-seasoned crust, the waffles were airy & reminded me of communion wafers. I did not care for the mushy slaw that ruined the sandwich or the sparse sauce on the chicken.   The wifey settled for a burger as there were no pasta options for her. The burger was meh and regrettable.  Service was just ok.  On a cool, rainy day trying to find find parking in annoying downtown to get here, I wanted more.",

The service started out a little slow, it took a long time for our server to take our drink order then it took forever for the Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates) to come out. That being said, the bacon wrapped dates were awesome!!! I was really excited for the Mac n cheese croquettes--I saw them go by and they looked amazing. I was a little disappointed bc they were dry inside when I expected them to be creamy and cheesy. We also got the wagyu burger--the beef was so tender and flavorful! The burger was really good I would have liked to try a bite or two of dessert but we had to get to a show...maybe next time. We came on a Friday and there was no happy hour pricing, which was kind of disappointing. We're local and expect a decent happy hour. Overall it was good, not great, but I'm willing to come back!",

    "text": "I just had to add another 5 star review to this place for one reason only....my mom loved the food. My mom doesn't like anything! She is the most critical person I think I have ever met when it comes to restaurants. No dish is ever good enough and she never likes the drinks. She always manages to find something wrong, and criticize both.   I knew I wanted to go downtown Vegas one of the nights I was here, so I googled restaurants in downtown Vegas. I clicked on an article called \"Ten best restaurants in Downtown Vegas\" and Therapy was one of them. It just seemed perfect, as i didn't want a place inside of a casino or a street-food type of place. I looked on Yelp and the menu looked like it had something for everyone so I made a reservation. I've given up on pleasing my mom, so I wasn't thinking of her. I just assumed she would hate the food like she does at every other restaurant.   Although my son and his gf got the big sexy burger, which they loved, the rest of us just shared a bunch of different things and it was all delicious! We ordered the fire roasted corn, the chicken meatballs, the Super Mac, the Crab dip, and the Perfect Cure. Even the soup was sharable! Instead of coming in one bowl, it came it 3 small bowls. It was a tomato soup with cheddar bacon dumplings. Omg it was so good! The menu didn't say it was spicy but it was. That was my favorite dish.   Ok so back to my mom, I put a little of everything on her plate and then just ignored her because I didn't want to hear her complaints. After I had 2 drinks in me, I got brave and asked how she liked everything. I almost had a heart attack when she said \"oh I loved it!\" WHAAATT!!!?? Did I hear correctly!!?? Did she just say she LOVED IT!!?? That's when I decided to write this review.   So if you are ever in Vegas, and want some good food, drinks, and service, come to Therapy! I know rude and I know nice, and this place is full of the nicest people. Everyone in my party loved the service, food, and drinks. It's also conveniently located steps from the entrance to the Fremont Street experience so once you're done, you can walk on over!",

The ambiance was upbeat, classy, and fun for all. Perfect place to be to celebrate a special event, complete with spectacular food.  The chicken meatballs were perfection. They are a must-have, especially if you're a fan of cilantro/coriander. Or a fan of good food. They were bursting with flavor when we ordered them and we'll order them again.  Energy was off-the-charts amazing. The food was phenomenal but its the service that really counts, and the service was definitely there. The down-to-earth, friendly hosts and hostesses of the evening made return customers out of us.",

Neon signs everywhere adversing steak and lobster for cheap.  I wasn't convinced and pulled out Yelp instead.  All the 4 star 2$$ places were closing in 25 min.    We almost walked into Denny's and then a cheap burger joint but glad we didn't as we found therapy at the end of Fremont street.  I saw the four stars in Yelp and was excited to try it.   We were not disappointed.  We had the French dip, juicy and delicious.  The truffle chips with it was addictive.  We ordered an extra side of it.  Also got the ceasar - loved the way they did it and high quality baby romaine they used.  Yum!  Also ordered the oxtail empanadas.   We were so full only ended up having one.  Will be a great snack.   What a great find.  We sat at the bar. Holly and Shannon were great bartenders and the atmosphere was nice.  We ended up chatting with our neighbors and had a great time. Highly recommend.  ;-)",

She said yes but couldn't not be bothered to actually do it, she went behind the bar and took the bacon out and brought it back to the table. Then the wrong meal was brought over for my friend and when the food runner came over to try and bring the right one we could hear the manager very loudly saying \"just leave it it's too late\"--like he wouldn't notice he was just served something he didn't order. After we finished eating we had to wait about 20 minutes to pay our check because whenever we did see our server she would not even make eye contact with us. A totally disappointing experience for sure. The food was fine but nothing fantastic and certainly not worth dealing with such rude people.",

The night before, we had the brussel sprouts from Wolfgang Pucks at MGM and I thought that was the best I've tried until Therapy. Our server Jason was excellent. Very attentive and helpful and was fun to \"talk story\" with like we say in Hawaii. Can't wait for our next trip to Vegas and more Therapy!!",

    "text": "Some things have changed since I was here three years ago not too long after the restaurant opened.  I had a talk at the Mob Museum later in the evening so I came here for dinner first.    The restaurant was empty and the hostess said I could sit anywhere I wanted.  I chose a two top near the front on the raised area with a view to Fremont Street to enjoy watching tourists.  I was given the menu when I was seated and my server soon came and asked about a drink.  Ordering my standard iced tea, I kept looking over the menu.  She brought my iced tea and I was ready to order.  I opted for the Ricky Ricardo--Therapy's take on a Cuban sandwich.  I also ordered truffle parmesan fries.  After the server left, I realized she had not left any sweetener for the iced tea.  Seated the way I was, I tried to turn around to see if I could get her attention.  No success.    When she brought my sandwich about 10 minutes later, I was then able to ask for artificial sweetener.  There was a couple in the restaurant now so there were three people there.    The sandwich was good tasting but calling it \"Therapy's Signature Cuban\" is to do disservice to Cuban sandwiches.  There was a lot of pork, a thin slice of ham on the bottom, and a lot of Swiss cheese on bread that wasn't toasted like a real Cuban.  The house made pickles were on the side along with some pickled sweet yellow pepper rings.  This would be better named a pork Philly cheesesteak because that's the kind of sandwich it is.  The fries were crispy and the fine strands of parmesan gave them some nice flavor.  I decided to have dessert.  There was one new item since I was there and I ordered it--chocolate bread pudding.  It's a dessert I only rarely get.  I'm not a fan of warm desserts but I gave it a chance.  This was the best part of the meal.  Topped with caramelized banana slices, banana sorbet, and Therapy smoke wagon whiskey salted caramel, the dessert was good tasting.  There was also an amount of a finely ground mixture along the edge of one side of the bread pudding that was a nice counterpoint to the softness of the bread.  Prices are more like Strip prices, not Fremont East District pricing.  I would have been better off going a block south to Carson Street.",

The steak was so flavorful and the chicken was so juicy and the red velvet waffles was amazing. I can't remember the names of the appetizers we ordered but all good. My sister ordered a sweet pasta dish and she loved it. There was 4 of us and felt like we ate like kings and we spent less then 100 before tip. I highly recommend eating here.",

Located in downtown Las Vegas near the El Cortez Hotel, a very cool atmosphere dining area with patio seating as well. They had their new brunch menu release with just a few options at the time we dined, looking forward to seeing how much more items will be added to the brunch menu.   We got to enjoy their Adobo Fried Rice, House made Betty's Biscuits, Berry Simple and Red Velvet Chicken and waffles, which all were very fulfilling and portion sizes were just right. Our other families tried their burger sliders, Fried Mac Croquettes and the King. Everyone enjoyed their meals as well.  Customer service from our server was ok, not much interaction with our party, took her a while to check up on our party to see if we were ready to order. We ordered our drinks first while waiting for a couple more people to our party. Would've been nice if our server explained to our party that they had a short brunch menu roll out.  Chef Chris came out to our party table to greet us, which was very nice of him to take time off away from the busy kitchen. Chef explained about the new brunch menu and what he has planned ahead for Therapy with new menu items. Very excited for Chef Chris on his new journey. Will definitely check them out again soon.",

Therapy delivered!  The ambience was good, this night they did have a DJ who was playing pretty loud music, but it was St. Patricks Day, so that may have been why. We were far enough away from the speaker that my boyfriend and I could still have a conversation at a normal volume, but I imagine that would not have been the case for those closer.   We shared the chorizo empanadas which were delish, and then also split the \"Ricky Ricardo\" Cuban sandwich, which was AMAZING. I loved the flavors of the sandwich, the plantains it came with, and allll the pickles that were included too! I would definitely order this sandwich again. My boyfriend said it was one of the best Cuban sandwiches he's ever had. We split the smores dessert, but I would skip this in the future, and order one of their fun cocktails instead.   Overall, I would definitely visit again if in the area!",

    "text": "Therapy is like Meditation through talking about Certain Perspectives, Problems and your Differences. This place is all about comfort Food, as in the Food is like Meditation throughout the Meal. Relaxes you with eat Bite or Sip that you Take. Like the sign said outside: After a couple days in Vegas who doesn't need a little Therapy. What was once a run down Dollar Store turned into an Eye Capturing eatery that attracts Locals & Out of Towners alike to take in Meal like they've never have before.   Just a bit past Fremont Street but before Container Park, I walked in to this Cool, Swank Joint that brought a casual feeling. There was also an Open Kitchen and an upper floor dining area, It was slow as there were only 2 Other Groups, as I was peering at the Unusual Statues like a Scorpion made out of Wrenches and a Bike Chain. I walked over to the Bar and sat down to have my Lunch. I talked to my waitress for a bit before placing my Order. None of the Cocktails really struck me as interesting except one called Spiced Gingerbread (Ginger Rum, Spiced Pumpkin Liqueur, Bailey's, Pumpkin Puree and Orange Bitters). Generous Spiral of Whipped Cream over the Top, got that Spice that slowly lingers on your Mouth, Orange was light but I thought that the Ice was unnecessary in the Drink. It was good but it was more of a December drink (I came in October) a week after I was there they had a Drink called the Boozy Bat (which should've been a Monthly Drink) or have drinks on the menu named after the City's beloved NHL Team the Vegas Golden Knights.  To start off I got the Empanadas (filled with Braised Oxtail) with a side of Harissa/Lime Sauce. As I bit into the Pastry to feel that Unctuous Meat then dip into this sauce that had that Hot Spice that stays with you but goes away eventually, the Lime was pretty light. I was trying to pace myself as this was an Hour and 40 Minutes after my Late Breakfast at Donut Bar. For my Main I decided to get myself a Sandwich, the Ricky Ricardo (after the namesake Character's Cuban Heritage from I Love Lucy). Loads of Slow Roasted Pork with Ham & Swiss Cheese, Dijon Mayonnaise and with some Plantains and Pickled Vegetables on the Side. The Meat had that Melt in your Mouth Tender feeling, with an excruciating Richness that can be mellowed out by the Pickled Vegetables on the Side (Onions, Cauliflower and Cucumbers). The Plantains while Crisp on the Edges I felt were Slimy in the Middle and did not finish them.  There was a Salad on the Menu called Beets by Therapy that really captured my interest (Different colored Beets, Goat Cheese, Hearts of Palm, Hazelnuts and Orange Ash). It said on the Menu that it was only for Dinner but I asked if they could've made an exception and they said that all the components wouldn't have been ready so that was a Bummer. Anyway I skipped on something sweet cuz I was feeling pretty Full, so I paid and was well on my Way, I thought that this Therapy Session went good for the Most Part. I'll be sure to let them know again when I'll schedule my next Appointment !!!",

We split some sort of delicious salad with walnuts and watermelon radish and apple and some sort of light and delightfully citrusy dressing followed by dreamy elotes and truffle fries and peach vodka bellinis and god damn it feels good to get help. They also played throwback rock tunes the whole time which I enjoyed very much.",

    "text": "We came at a pretty busy time. We got the only seats left ( a counter facing the street) which I actually highly recommend for people watching purposes. The tables are right next to the bar so I was surprised that we waited a pretty long time for our drinks ( soda water and ginger beer)! I saw Shishito peppers as part of a dish but I wanted them on their own. They had no problem doing that, which I think speaks volumes for their customer service. Our waiter, Zack was SO professional and really seemed to care about our experience. He apologized for any wait we had and then came back many times to make sure we were happy.   I can't leave a review without mentioning the IN THE \"GNUDI\"! To Die For! Well, I wouldn't really die for it but I might be willing to suffer a cold for it. Had it been socially acceptable, I would have licked the platter clean! They have a very large upstairs area with a massive TV that would be pretty cool for large groups. If you like small plates and a creative menu, this is a great downtown stop!",

    "text": "Cute place near on Fremont Street once you pass all the attractions and sights. Went based off of some Yelp review and not wanting to eat at the casinos. Ordered from the happy hour menu, which we came in with only 5 minutes to spare. Ordered Mexican Street corn, Brussels sprouts, chicken meatballs and firecracker shrimp tacos. The food was fresh (except the shrimp seemed like they were previously frozen) but I wasn't excited with the flavors and seasonings. The Brussels sprouts were too salty, and the chicken meatballs were on the dry side. The corn and tacos were definitely the stars of the show. As for service, our bartender wasn't the friendliest. She seemed as we were an inconvenience to her. There was conflicting information between the hostess and bartender about the happy hour time and the bartender acted like it was our fault. Overall, I wouldn't say this place is horrible, but this isn't a must-go place. Go if you have the time and want excellent happy hour prices.",

He was super friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. He was awesome.   We had the fried Mac and cheese. Definitely recommend. And we also had the red velvet and fried chicken... I was nervous it would be too sweet but it was close to perfection. Not too sweet, not to savory. I've had a LOT of chicken and waffle in my day and this was next level.   The cured board, so the meats and cheeses, was good but not great. Would probably skip for the Mac and cheese and/or chicken and waffle sliders.   We then split the shrimp tacos, which were also very good.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. The outdoor seating has great views of Fremont Street. Glad we found this gem. Shout out again to Jonathan!!!",

A little small so if you are just walking on off Fremont you may not get a table. Although tables were opened we were told they had reservations we sat at the bar.   Seems like the trend downtown is \"reservations\" but the tables are always empty. Maybe when people don't show they should give up the tables to guests waiting? With it being Vegas everyone gets waisted and ends up somewhere else.   I am giving them four starts because while to food was ok I felt the prices were over the top for what you got.",

The weird carrot cake (with a real part of carrot) is surprisingly satisfying.  This is a perfect place for a Happy Hour, or after work drinks.  Lunch sometimes feels a bit out of place.  And dinner can feel a bit lonely, like you should have gone home to your wife or husband.  (It's not much of a dinner place, IMHO).  But out shopping, or before going home, go in and take the load off. You'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "Visited on a Saturday night at 8 PM with no reservations.  Place was packed but we were lucky enough to find a spot at the bar. (Party of 2)  Service: 4/5 The bartender was also our server since we were at the bar.  She had our menus ready for us as soon as we sat down and took our orders promptly.  She kept checking on our food orders as well as keeping our drinks fresh.    Food: 4/5 The oxtail empanadas were tasty and is something I look forward to on my next visit. The chicken meatballs were also a hit for me.  The size was only slightly larger than a ping pong ball and 6 came out in a bowl, but the meatballs were dense with chicken and rich with flavor.  The raw filet tartar looked and tasted great.  The egg yolk and parmesan cheese mixed well with the filet.  The carrot cake was tasty and presented in this unconventionally mashed potato shaped fashion.  It was interesting and definitely didn't hinder the taste. Best part of the night was being introduced to tonic syrup for the first time with my Tito's vodka.  It gives an appearance that it's been mixed with Coke or Pepsi.  It's a little sweeter than tonic water but not too sweet and really takes the edge off the vodka.  Tonic syrup is something I'll be looking for in the future. (see pics)  Value: 3.5/5 The appetizers are priced in the $11-$17 range and the entrees are fairly priced for the quality of food you receive.  If you have a big appetite the bill can add up quickly but you will have a tasty good time.    Ambiance: 4/5 Industrially decorated with high ceilings to make it appear even more spacious.  It's going to be busy and noisy on the weekends as it is a popular spot downtown.  There seems to be a mix of parties of either looking to eat and run or staying for awhile ordering plate after plate. The tables and booths are separated enough and comfortable for dining.  There's a good energy and vibe that helps kick start a long evening out.  Summary: This is my second visit and I enjoyed it as much as the first.  I highly recommend reservations if you're coming down on a weekend night.  The location on Fremont street is close to the main bars in the vicinity, all walking distance.  Therapy is my go to place in Downtown for a light dinner and some good drinks right before I head out for the night.",

First time, the group of us got a few appetizers to share: oxtail empanadas and the crab dip. I couldn't eat the crab dip, but everyone said it was really good. For dinner, I got a filet, which was so tasty!! I almost ordered it again the second visit but after a tiny bite of the short rib I couldn't say no to that. Oh yea, on that note.. the short rib is amazing. The polenta that it's served on is meh, but the meat is amazing. On my second visit, we also got the mac and cheese, which the portion was definitely large enough for 5 of us to have small shares of.   Dessert wise, they have a yummy s'mores dish that you can order with or without bacon. I recommend it with bacon. Because bacon.   Both times I've made reservations and the first time we were instantly seated but the second time we ended up having to wait quite a bit even though there were empty tables. That being said, the gentleman at the front who greeted us was extremely friendly and had a great personality in the few moments of chatting.   The restaurant isn't huge, but it does have a bar area, a downstairs dining area, and an upstairs dining area. The decor is pretty cool, but as you walk down the hall to the bathrooms there's a bit of an unpleasant smell.   Therapy is delicious and I recommend going. Making it part of a friends night out is definitely some much needed and super fun group therapy.",

We were in Vegas doing media coverage for Punk Rock Bowling Music Festival and after several frustrated attempts to get some work done at our hotel and even Starbucks, we decided to call around to some restaurants to see if they could help us out.   Therapy was more than happy to save us a table by a power outlet and offer us the wifi code. Our waiter was incredible, he was super attentive while understanding that we needed to get some work done. We really enjoyed talking to him and he made us feel super comfortable and welcome, making sure we had everything we needed and telling us to stay as long as we'd like, even after we finished our meal. Therapy was certainly a welcome respite from that crazy Fremont Street life and we were so grateful for their hospitality (plus the food was to die for!).   I only wish we had found Therapy sooner and spent some more time relaxing there in our own special bubble :)",

Bartender gave me a massive pour of white wine blend, which who can complain about that.  The tuna tartare was one of the dishes suggested by the bartender and wow did I end up loving that dish. It was soooo flavorful and I truly enjoyed the combination of crunch, spice and creaminess.  Only odd thing is the bartender had to go manually add the HH discount and left the bar. Feel like they should a discount button or something.",

My friend got there first, mentioned the reservation, but staff said they can't find it. I even sent a screenshot of the email confirmation to my friend. Still can't find it. I also put a note on my reservations because I have a service dog, just out of courtesy to the business, even though legally I don't have to give notice. My friend mentioned it while staff seated my friend at the bar, but staff asked for a permit for the service dog. Legally not required to have paperwork or vest or any identification for a service dog. Business obviously isn't trained on ADA. Don't go to this place if you have a disability, especially if you have a medical equipment with you. When I try to go here on my healthier days, get welcomed in, and get to try their food, I'd leave another review.",

Not being a mac and cheese person, I can't tell you if it's good or bad.  The first visit here was with a couple of omnivores. We sat downstairs, split a good bottle of wine, and tried a bunch of shared plates of which the most memorable was the chicken and waffle sliders. Our consensus on that experience was that it was good, but not great.  This second visit was with a pescatarian. We sat upstairs (crowded) and ordered cocktails as well as the drunken tofu (tasteless), crab dip (heavy layer of scorched cheese on top, all the oily fat was rendered out of the cheese and that did nothing for the blah crab dip underneath), Caesar salad (more blah tastelessness with dressing that was basically mayonnaise), tuna tartare (the one bright spot - lots of flavor and texture with dried lotus chips a nice addition) and the carrot cake (deconstructed - and too sweet).  I would say this is a nice spot to have drinks and people watch, but the food needs work, or at least some salt.",

Get them and don't ask questions people! Next we got the butter parmesan brussel sprouts. Now those you should only get if you have a goal of getting diabetes. Not saying they are bad, they're delicious. Maybe too delicious lol (too much butter). We finished with the therapy's signiture salad with chicken.

That being said the waiter we had was very friendly and helpful. They food was pretty darn tasty as were the cocktails. We enjoyed the Brussel sprouts, The Shorty and the duck. I would eat all three of those again. And to be glutenous I had to have the s'mores dessert which of course I added bacon too and I was not disappointed. They have lots of gluten free options and are very knowledgeable on the subject and they offer a generous military discount.",

Ordered the following items including the price: 3 different empanadas (oxtail, veggie and spicy chorizo) $21 - they're very small. For 9 pieces, this is definitely a meal for one.   Super mac with bacon $13 - Therapy blend cheese. Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it was okay. When they said blend cheese, I was thinking more like mozzarella, ricotta, etc. Nope. Their house blend.  Crab dip $15 - Gluten free! Yeah I enjoyed this one except the most except the fact that the crab was too salty. Heart attack. Yum.  Chicken meatballs $13 - The green sauce on the bottom is jalapeno pesto. So yeah, it'll be spicy.  Crumbled carrot cake $10 - This is a joke right? You know how hard it was to eat crumbled carrot cake? I tried to fork it and it just fell apart. Still good tho, but I wouldn't eat this again.  So the bottom line is, it's a-okay. I wouldn't really go back here as it's not really worth the price for the small portions of food and okay tasting food. Service was subpar, it felt like a regular restaurant service.",

    "text": "Wow!  I was set on Le Thai, because I already love it there, but so glad we came into Therapy for dinner last night to try something new. Here's what our party of 5 experienced:  The Food:  The good:  CHICKEN MEATBALLS - comes with 6, we ate them all, quickly. Tender and savory, I would order these again.   FIRE ROASTED CARROTS - the vanilla bourbon maple syrup was divine. And the feta. Perfect.  SHRIMP CEVICHE - the tomato lime sauce was just so satisfying, I actually was running my fork along my dish to get a few more final tastes when I finished. Well done.   THERAPY SIGNATURE SALAD - the red wine vinaigrette was very acidic, some found it slightly salty, but I enjoyed it. I would like to try the charred kale salad, but I am a sucker for granny smith, candied walnut, and bleu cheese combos..  The not so good:  IN THE \"GNUDI\" - maybe it was the truffle oil, maybe it was that it was our last dish. It was a miss for me.  HANGAR STEAK TARTAR - with the confit egg and herbs...kind of was like eating meat waiting to be rolled into balls..and I'm a fan of tartar and carpaccio in general.  The neither here nor there:  CAST IRON SMORES - eat it while it's hot. Pretty good, but not memorable.  The Service: it was slammed in here. Park across the street was having an event outside with a half pipe and some snowboards. The bar was in the weeds (we sat there for an hour waiting for our table). We sat for probably 20 minutes without even being greeted, let alone served. With a barback, 2 bartenders, and a runner, I felt like they could have done better with a little assistance from the manager. I saw him, he seemed to be of no help whatsoever. Not sure what he did aside from look around. He didn't talk to guests or step in to make drinks or run anything. Strange. In spite of that, they were clearly trying, and I have been in their shoes. No judgement here.   Our food runner was awesome. Wish I got his name so I could give him the good feedback. Very sweet person.  4 stars instead of 5 for the lack of help on the floor, but they did really well for being so busy. Great food, I would definitely return!  P.S. also, Manhattans are typically made with a swirl of vermouth around the glass, not a shot of it. Not sure if that was intentional. If so, this needs to be reconsidered.",

It's fancier than some of the other new places (publicus/glutton/etc) and more restaurant-y than bar-y. The beer and wine and cocktail selections are quite good, with a couple unique beer offerings I hadn't heard of.  I liked the menu: small plates, \"new American\" style, kinda fancy, heavy on the veggies. Most of these things would be a turn-off to Mr. A., but luckily they had a burger/sandwich menu, too, to keep him interested. I tried the carrots, brussel sprouts, shrimp scampi, and 'in the gnudi.' Liked them all. Loved the gnudi, but it was a pretty big portion for just one person to eat and my husband isn't about to try something involving 'fig jam.' Also it's really rich, so I couldn't finish it. Also loved the carrots (although, again, too sweet for the Mr.). Brussels sprouts were good and shrimp scampi was good, too, but they weren't extra memorable. For 4 small plates and 2 beers, it ran us almost $90 with tax and tip, which seems a little high.  Service was friendly and efficient, but it's just too expensive for 5 stars. Would go back with out of towners or for a cocktail if in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "Eight of us came here to celebrate a birthday.  Perfect! We each ordered appetizers, main dishes, drinks, and, as our waiter was informed, our intent was to sample and share everything on the menu.  We came close to it! We were given extra sharp knives, had large plates on which to put our share of appetizers and meals.  Our waiter, Jonathan, was the best; he made excellent recommendations, was very friendly, took our MANY orders through the evening (requiring many trips to the table as we ordered only two or three things at a time) with good spirits and a smile. JoAnn was the expediter that night, and, boy, did she hustle, moving quickly around the restaurant to help servers, even offering to take a group photo of us when she saw what we were attempting. Three others also helped at our table, bringing water, napkins, dishes, clearing; altogether friendly, observant servers making sure the dining experience was the best. Oh, and the manager came to the table to make sure all was well, which was nice!  Yum for the food! The pork belly was the best I've ever eaten, and I'm glad--as I've had it three or four times before and NOT liked it--that I gave it a try. And finished off the plate.  Be warned if you like fat; there was none. All the other pork belly I've had before was just all fat. This was fall-apart tender and flavorful meat.  The Devils on Horseback appetizer was lovely, as was almost everything else. The only dish we didn't scrape the plate for was the macaroni.  It was creamy smooth, but just too bland even after we added salt and pepper to it. Had we ordered it with bacon, it might have been enjoyed more, but more flavorful cheese needs to be used, or the dish taken off the menu. That being said, we have already decided to return here for our next gathering to repeat some favorites and try the (few!) dishes we didn't get to this time! Bon Appetit!",

    "text": "*sigh* A bad experience. Did I upset the Food Gods? No idea but I sure did have hell of a lunch date! My date and I arrived at therapy around 2 o'clock to try the beautiful and delicious food we had previously discovered on Yelp. When we walked in we were immediately greeted and sat at a table. Our waiter was a beautiful young lady with dark brown hair that was also working the bar. She went over the menu with us because we were new customers, which I appreciate and took our drink and food order. The food literally took 30 to 45 minutes to cook because we had to leave right when the food came out to go pay for an additional hour for our parking. That was very inconvenient and a bit frustrating the fact that lunch was fairly empty but I guess that's what you get when you go to a restaurant that cooks fresh food. My partners ordered the famous burger and I settled for the red velvet waffle chicken sandwich. The host that greeted us at the door delivered our food.        My face frowned when I looked at my plate. The waffles were obviously very burnt inside and out having a black coating and a smoky smell. I immediately pulled out my phone and compared pictures on the same plate that other people had ordered on YELP & I noticed that everyone else is waffle was a bright red or bright pink color without the burnt glaze. My partner asked me, \"Are your waffles burnt??\". He waved down who seemed to be the manager on duty. Heavyset Caucasian male over to the table. I politely pointed at the waffles and asked to get a new batch because I received burnt waffles. I had already tried to scarf it down and cover it with mad syrup, but it did no justice.        What made me feel a certain type of way is the fact that the manager sat there and to my face explained that the waffles were not burnt and that they just come that way. The hell.... I don't know if he was trying to be funny or he was blatantly being an a****** looking me dead in my face telling me that these burnt rectangles are perfectly fine. I think he was trying to make me feel stupid!!! But he insisted on making a new batch for me. 7 - 10 minutes later I receive a new batch of red velvet waffles and just as the ones before had a charcoal coat. It. Tasted. Burnt and unappetising. I put all the waffles to the side and simply at the juicy chicken and left hungry. The bartender then came over to check on us. She asked his our food was, but before we could even answer she asked me \" Are those burnt???\" I shrugged and told her that the manager said they can't this way. She looked at the kitchen and said \"oh..\" And walked away with a scrunched face back to the bar. When we were done eating we never were given our check because our waiter, the bartender was busy. A birthday girl and her group came in and they ask wanted drinks. The manager is in the corner folding silverware and the host is upstairs, doing whatever. So we had to walk up to the bar to pay. We left no tip.   I was jealous that my partner enjoyed his bomb ass burger and I had shitty food and questionable service considering I only eat at YELP 4-5/5 reviewed restaurants. I am willing to try this place again but I will come for dinner instead to avoid #1 Whoever the Chef was and #2 the manager.   Good Luck",

Everything was was well balanced, flavorful, creative and delicious. Portion sizes were generous, plating was artful and overall experience was top notch.   Therapy is a welcome retreat from the overpriced underwhelming restaurants on the strip. Make sure to make a reservation, we had trouble getting a seat the second time.",

We didn't know the kitchen was closing in five minutes, but were relieved when the server let us order anyway.  We paid them a pretty penny for our late night nosh, so, good on them for recognizing the Drunk Hunger when it's ready to fork over their charge cards.  Not many options for pescatarian little-me, but I made do with the delicious lime-crema infused street corn and some ridic truffle fries.  My friends made me try bites of their other (insanely delicious) food, after picking out huge globules of bacon or pancetta.  That being said, if I were to visit this place again at a reasonable hour I would see if they could make me their truffle mac sans meat.  It would be worth the (probable) dirty looks from the kitchen just to try.  While our tab wasn't cheap, I felt the food was delicious enough to be decent value.  I'd go again in a heart beat.

    "text": "I want to really like this place because I enjoy new dining options in DTLV. However, this place just wasn't doing it for me. I believe they're going through an identity crisis? Though, I'm not quite sure.   I would like to say the hostesses greeting guests were very friendly, welcoming, and so was the bartender who served us, however, friendly only gets you so far.   First we took a look beer and wine list and the beer list is quite extensive and we had many questions about the different beers, unfortunately the bartender didn't know very much or even know how to pronounce them. They also server frozen drinks, which I thought was a bit odd considering it's all inside and it definitely isn't a pool.   Next, many \"manager\" or \"owner\" type guys were looming around (maybe they owned the place, maybe not). Now, I understand it was the first night, but none of these guys really seemed to be professionals, we weren't greeted by them, or asked how we enjoyed ourselves or anything. The reason I knew they had something to do with the place is because they seemed to have set up shop in the corner or the bar doing their work, eating, drinking (it was a big glup type drink, classy) all in view of the guests. If you are the manager or owner you should be greeting ever guest walking in your door on opening night, not just your buddies, and ask how everyone is doing.   The food was good, and this it was I'm actually rating my review on. We had the roasted cauliflower which is one of my favorites anywhere. This was super oily though, so for me I probably wouldn't order it again. The summer squash flatbread was great and my boyfriend really enjoyed the oxtail empanadas. None of the dishes were to die for, but they were good.  If this place is going to be more like a sports bar than a tapas experience then I probably won't be running back, especially if the owners/managers carried themselves the way they did.",

    "text": "I went to Therapy for dinner two nights in a row on Jan 29, 2018 and January 30.  I had the same server each night (Mike) and extremely attentive and friendly service from him and nice conversations with the manager.  On the first night, I started with a Caesar salad (with bacon, which is a really nice addition).  It was fresh and delicious from the crispy croutons to the flavorful dressing with a twist of garlic.  Presented beautifully.  Then I ordered the chimichurri steak and parmesan fries.  The steak smelled funny to me, chemical-like and I munched on my fries (outstanding) until Mike came back.  I tasted one bite.  I explained to Mike that I thought the steak tasted like it had been cooked over a gas grill and had the flavor of lighter fluid.  I have probably sent back about 3 orders in my entire middle aged life, so I felt bad about it, but Mike was very reassuring and I had a new steak before long.  It was delicious, had a beautiful balance of some acid and some sweet (lime I think) and some smoky flavors.  It had been marinated and was perfectly cooked to the medium rare I love.  I ate every bite.  I did not care for the onion straws on top, they were rubbery.  But I had plenty to eat with the fries.  The manager stopped by my table to apologize and offered me new fries with my steak (very nice but I declined as I had my fill even though they were amazing).  She and Mike were just concerned that I had a good experience and that I felt no guilt at all.  They both handled it beautifully and I felt so comfortable I went back the next night.  I ate more lightly the next night (I'm in LV for work and was by myself both times, at a nice table in this beautiful and elegantly simple- decorated restaurant.  I love the calm atmosphere.  Mike greeted me by name, which I found incredibly impressive and remembered I drink unsweetened ice tea.  The manager also came by and offered me a cappucino on the house-- very sweet.  I had the bacon wrapped dates which were an incredible combination with goat cheese and truffle and this to-die-for red pepper sauce.  Also filling, then I had dessert and the chocolate in the s'mores made me want to lick the plate, just the fix I needed.  When I return to Las Vegas, I will definitely visit Therapy again.  It does have something special-- human connection that you don't often find in restaurants.  I travel solo for business pretty frequently, and this is the first time in 25 years that I've been welcomed back like I'm a regular.  I very much appreciated that and the delicious food.  It was a great experience both nights I was there.  If Mike and the manager and the others who refilled my tea and checked on me as I was working on my computer are reading this, thank you.",

Food is excellent.  I would eat here weekly, except I have ADHD. When I'm on Fremont and walk by looking for a place to eat there are people waiting.

The reason for the 2 star review:  1. They had great happy hour specials ( I showed up at 11 on a thursday). Me and my friends ordered a bunch of four roses whiskeys on the rocks....for $5 bucks! Fantastic deal. Then the bill comes.....they charged for ice! Yes ice! We asked the bartender if the drink listed was part of the happy hour and she confirmed that it was. And somehow we didn't get the $5 dollar price. I looked over the menu after getting the bill and it didn't say anything about a charge for ice. I'm surprised that they didn't charge of for the use of the cups. Just absurd. Be aware of extra hidden charges!  2. The DJ blasts the music!. He plays nothing but club edm, which is fine. However, there isn't a dance floor at all. Not a huge deal, but it didn't make sense to me.",

I ordered the  chimichurra steak  at the recommendation of our server: a inexpensive cut ( still $25 on menu) which was diced w/chimichurra sauce: again good, not great. My wife ordered their filet which was oddly cut in half, assuming the chef was checking temperature in a rudimentary way. Who cuts a filet in half and serves that way? Again just good, barely. Here's why we wont go back: All seperate checks without discussion from server and my check (not my wife and I) actually had a $3 charge to put ice in my Crown Royal. WTF?? I get I'm spending $11 for a top shelf whiskey but to add $3 for ice??  When asked, the manager said when a guest asks for \" on the rocks\" it makes it a double. It wasn't.  The line items on my check said: Crown Royal: $11:00 and the next line said: ice: $3:00. With the dining options downtown We're done with Therapy.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love the food here.  On paper, each menu item sounded flavorful and creative, but I'm sad to say that just wasn't the case for me.  I will start by saying that two of the items we ordered were pretty danged good:  the oxtail empanadas and the chicken meatballs.  The rest, however, wellllllll let's just say very underwhelming.  We ordered the baked truffle ricotta \"In the Gnudi\" and although the cast iron skillet it was served in was screaming hot, the cheese itself was cold and hard and I was not a fan of the crostini that was served with it; too sweet when combined with the truffle and honey on the ricotta.  The lobster mac n cheese sounded delish as well, but quite frankly was bland and fishy tasting and smelling.  Took one bite and that was more than enough.  Lastly, we ordered the barramundi sliders, and again bland and fishy.  The kitchen should probably consider fresher fish offerings.  It reminded me of walking into a grocery store's meat department and smelling spoiled fish.  Not good.  The atmosphere is amazing however.  Love the high ceilings, brick walls, open floor and bar area.  And of course, it's hard to beat the setting of Downtown Vegas among all of the revitalized businesses and Arts District.  Maybe the kitchen was having an off night, I'm not sure, as this place didn't live up the reviews we'd read.  Unfortunately we won't know, because we most likely won't go back.",

First is its in a great location off Fremont Street extension to the east just a block down.  The area is hopping with new places, bars, restaurants and shops.  Great vibe in the area and Therapy definitely adds to this atmosphere.  It is combination of small, sharable plates with a few well executed main dishes that knows what it is and what it does well.  We shared multiple small plates with our favorites being the oxtail empanadas, pork sliders, the meat/cheese plate, Caesar salad w/ chicken and chicken meatballs.  All were really good and great portion for sharing and trying new things.  The table went crazy for the Mac & cheese which is so rich and creamy with some bacon thrown in.  Ordered a second batch after the first one disappeared.  We never made it to the entrees since the small plates were so filling and reasonably priced for sharing.  The bar did some great cocktails with the Lemon drop going over well with the ladies and lots of craft beer selections for guys and some good scotch selections for the real men.  Service was excellent from Georgi and the manager stopped by several times to visit and check in.  Make this place happen.",

We had 8 people and got 4 appetizers and each of us got one bite of each appetizer . My husband and I split the big sexy hamburger and that was fine because it was fairly large. When we said we were going to split it he said he would cut it into 4ths!? Haha. We told him in half would be fine. We ordered it medium and our friends ordered a big sexy medium as well and ours came out literally like raw hamburger meat and our friends was exactly what medium should look like. When we asked to have it cooked more we could hear the cook arguing with the waitress about how it was cooked medium. He sounded like he was trying to send it back to us?! I was appalled. He cooked it more but it was still pretty pink. We said whatever because by then our party was all done with their food and we were just starting. The waiters were pretty snooty and sometimes just straight up ignored us. The one very bright spot was the Mac and cheese appetizer. Holy hannah that was good mac and cheese. Too bad it was $10 and I got one bite",

    "text": "Suggested by a friend combined with the itch to get off the strip, this turned out to be a wonderful option for dinner. It's mainly American fare in a dining room that is unique and not generic. Although I understand their mixed drinks are excellent, we didn't have any.   Instead, we focused on the food starting with the \"In the 'Gnudi'\", an interesting dish of baked ricotta and fig jam. I loved that it was different than anything I've had in the past but it was also well prepared. Even though this place is known for its tapas, this is the only one we really had. Afterwards, we jumped into the entrees where I had the chimichurri steak. I have a hard time saying 'no' to this dish and for good reason! In this case, it was perfectly prepared (medium rare) and seasoned equally as well and the portion size was healthy. We finished off with the recommended carrot cake, which absolutely didn't disappoint and probably could have been the highlight at many other restaurants.   The service couldn't have been any better - excellent and honest suggestions by the waiter - and the ambiance was great for dinner. The one thing I would say is that the online menu isn't updated so we had rethink our entree selections. (It's still not updated as I write this.)",

    "text": "When comparing the hot triple threat of New American eats in DTLV, Therapy reluctantly gets the bronze medal by a few tenths of a point.  It's still worthy, offering things the others don't, like cozier seating, a nice sized bar, and the only place on the block with big TV's for sports.  But despite a few interesting menu twists, their dishes either match similarly in quality to their competitors or fall a bit short, but never really surpass.           The \"Crispy Fried Pig Ears\" are presented like a bride's bouquet at a high end redneck wedding.  This group friendly dish came a lot crispier with less breading on my most recent visit, which I felt to be not as good as my initial time; it still magically disappeared though.  The truffle honey mustard dipping sauce is kind of gross, so I just eat them straight, preferably with a large glass of Hamm's.    Another great partner with beer is \"Popcorn\".  The fried peanuts and maple candied bacon make for wonderful companions, but sharing this with actual companions is slightly awkward since you'll basically be eating bits that were touched, but unsuccessfully attempted to be picked up, by others when diving in for their handful.  I wanted chopsticks!  A bigger bowl with a mini shovel would work better.  I'd like a couple of hits of whatever the chef was smoking when he thought of this one.     The \"Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider\" is an eye catcher with all its color, but a crispier waffle would have made for a functional sandwich instead of sloppiness on a plate.  The fried chicken itself was crispy and very juicy.  I would have been down with just a bucket of that.  Definitely worth returning for, but I'll be eating this all deconstructed with a fork and knife next time.  One dish to be avoided is the \"Roasted Cauliflower\".  The extreme char masked any signs of seasoning.  That place on Carson that starts with a \"G\" does an incredible version of this.  Get the excellent \"Street Corn\" instead or save the extra bucks (and room) for one of Therapy's great desserts like carrot cake or smores.    3.7623235799213 stars.",

My girlfriend is in town from SF, so we had some big 'foodie shoes' to fill with finding places in Vegas to show her - I was up for the challenge and enjoyed bringing her outside of the usual 'Vegas Strip\" scene to Fremont.  We went first to Oak and Ivy - my favorite bar so far - which she loved, and immediately hopped onto Yelp to find a local restaurant near where we were walking... Enter: Therapy.  SERVICE: PHENOMENAL. Our bartender/server Manny was so friendly and descriptive of the menu. He knew each item, which he would refer, and took us on our first journey through their new menu seamlessly. The other wait staff never hesitated to refill water, check on us - the manager on duty came by and welcomed us to Vegas.   FOOD: We were floored! We had bourbon blackberry cocktails (called the Smash) - and I'm not the one to usually enjoy bourbon. We all shared a bunch of appetizers and food items including the Chimichurri Skirt steak with crispy onions, red velvet chicken and waffles, the Pretzel bread bites, roasted asparagus and roasted/charred kale.... the steak was so tender...the bread bites made in house with a beer cheese sauce...and the roasted veggies were devine. The red velvet chicken and waffles had juicy chicken and the waffles weren't too sweet or too dense...probably my favorite chicken and waffles I've had with two very nice sized \"sliders\". We also shared the cast iron S'mores - and let me tell you, we added bacon which was the right choice and TORE IT UP!  SCENE: Comfortable seating and a great style to the joint! I loved the vibe here and also the cleanliness!  We DEFINITELY will be back to have some Fremont Therapy soon!",

    "text": "My anxiety can only be cured by food. What better place to get that taken care of that than Therapy. The diners are your typical local downtown hipsters. The service was good.  The decription of menu items seemed all so delicious. We gave a few items a try...  In the \"Gnudi\": Fig jam, baked ricotta, truffle honey, roasted almonds, arugula on cranberry walnut crostini. They look like takoyaki with grilled bread on the side. Different textures and flavors in a simple dish. Sweetness from the fig jam and honey, the peppery taste from the arugula, the smokey flavor from the grilled crostini, the mild taste and creaminess from the ricotta, and the crunch from the almonds. 4/5  Oxtail Empanadas: Empanadas filled with oxtail with lime creme fraiche. Split the empanada in half to release the steam from the hot and juicy oxtail pieces then dip in creme fraiche. I just wish there was more of the tasty filling. 3.5/5  Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider: Crispy chicken breast with a red pepper remoulade in between red velvet Belgian waffles, with syrup on the side. The chicken itself was nice and crunchy without being heavy on the batter. The remoulade adds heat and tang but the sweet syrup with a hint of alcohol balances it out. I tried to eat this with my hands but the waffles weren't stable enough to hold the heavy chicken and the wet remoulade. Definitely eat with a fork and knife. 4/5  The French Dip: Roasted prime beef, horseradish cream on a grilled hoagie with truffle chips on the side. I haven't had a good beef sandwich in this country since I moved out of the MidWest. The jus is more like a gravy as it's thicker than your average jus but honestly, you won't even need it. The truffle chips were amazing. They weren't oily and they were freshly-made. They definitely taste like truffles. 5/5  I wanted to give the Roasted Jidori Chicken, Shrimp Scampi, and Filet Frites a try but I guess I would have to come back for more Therapy.",

    "text": "It's just bar food, but good bar food.   There are many options in Vegas for an \"upscale\" bar food experience, but sadly most of these spots fall pretty short when it comes to delivery. Therapy isn't reinventing the wheel here, but they are making a better, tastier, and more attractive place to hang with friends.   The location is great, smack dab in the middle of a bustling Downtown Las Vegas great for both tourist and locals alike. I came here after attending the Las Vegas Film Festival and instantly loved the decor and flow of this place. There are no walls in the place, you can literally see into the bar, kitchen, and upstairs dining area from anywhere on the lower level.   My guest and I weren't super hungry so we went with a smattering shareable food items found on the, \"Social Club\" menu section. The Oxtail Empanadas, The Chicken Meatballs, Roasted Curry Cauliflower and Mixed mushroom Flatbread.   From the best to the not so best... The Oxtail Empanadas, our server Georgie suggested these amazing little pockets of tender meat. Lite crispy pouches filled to the brim with slowed cooked shredded meat, a must order! Thanks Georgie!   The Mixed Mushroom Flatbread. Mushrooms, truffle oil, cheese, all on flattened puff pastry. This was a little heavy on the truffle oil, but was still very tasty. I really enjoyed the bacon cut into cubes rather than diced strips. Comes with a soft boiled egg for all that runny goodness!   Roasted Cauliflower. Solid curry flavor especially when paired with dates. Cooked perfect with a light snap as you bit into them.   The Chicken meatballs were just ok. They were a tad bland and dry, so thank goodness it came with a cilantro pesto. I pretty much had to drown the meatball in this tasty sauce. This might be a one-time thing so maybe I'll try this on my next visit.   This place is definitely worth a try even if you just pop in for a quick cocktail and snack.",

He was an all-star), the atmosphere was a split blend of classy and industrial, you could tell it was tailored for the younger generation of adult. While the drink menu isn't as large as some other places, it's impressively categorized to make selection easy.   Now let's talk food for a second... we did specifically come here for their special red velvet chicken and waffles, but also ordered their chicken mac and cheese out of spontaneous mood. Funny enough, the mac was the star of the night. I literally scraped the plate for cheese at one point haha. The chicken and waffles, while delicious, did let me down a little bit. It's hard to mess up the standard of the food but we came for the red velvet twist which neither of us discovered. It was basically just a waffle that's the color red. Delicious none the less, but kind of disappointing in novelty.   All in all great place that I will be returning to. :)",

I love the tuna tartare, and my fillet mignon was nicely cooked. My husband liked the mac & cheese croquettes and his chimichurri steak. The housemade sangria was super yummy too ( it's my drink of choice, so trust me ). I'm happy they are doing well, they took a ghetto souvenir shop and made it a beautiful space with a menu that is interesting but pedestrian at the same time.

Then...we sat.  For about 10 mins before we even got glasses of water and another 5-10 mins before our server came.  I have no idea why, there were 40% empty tables and servers running all over.  It seemed like we were invisible to them.  We had three apps (brussels sprouts-okay, crab dip-it's a crap dip, and tomato/beet/burrata salad-where was the burrata?) and an entree (chimichurri steak-tasted like meat w/ no seasoning and vinegar), total was $75 w/o tip,which was totally not worth it.  Our waitress was friendly enough, but overall, the staff was pretty dismissive, the food was absolutely marginal, and the bathrooms were filthy.  Won't be returning.",

Our alcohol tab wasn't expensive and the drinks were spot on, not watered down or skimpy. Two of us had pork chops which were cooked to perfection and the portion was generous.  Two of us had fresh trout served with ferro . Awesome dish the trout was served whole, descaled and deboned cut down the center. If you're not turned off by the trout head still having its head attached and you want fresh fish this was a great dish.   We shared 3 appetizers amongst the 4 of us which again portions were generous.  Overall this is a great restaurant, great vibe, perfect for groups, good spot just for drinks and appetizers,  nice place to eat dinner before hitting the old strip and not expensive for what we ordered. Make reservations this place gets booked fast.  We had Saturday night reservations at 8:30, after dinner the nearby clubs were getting started and old strip was hopping.",

I was in shock for a few minutes and thankfully recovered enough to decide on one of the unimaginative and equally unpalatable handheld items, or what these hip kids call sandwiches nowadays.  As an African American male with absolutely no ancestors involved in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, I was made to feel like I needed reparations after the prices charged for my meal and IPA draft.  The French Dip was a smidgeon better than what you could get at an Arby's here in Lansing, though in defense of the Home of the Horsey Sauce, at least with them you get some cheese of the genus chemical-byproduct with your sandwich, my French Dip was bare at Therapy.  The potato chips I received were indistinguishable from Lays' Truffle Oil \"recipe\".  I've been waited on by private chefs in Avignon, France's finest La Mirande, and have had widowers of late aristocrats in Monaco commit infanticide in front me and on their knees begging to have children from my superior gene-stock, so I know how to live and to enjoy.  This place is the loud and obnoxious, full of fools and their gold (I'll admit, I was one for one night).  Verdict: Inadequate.",

We ordered the Devils on horseback, which were solid and the Mac n cheese croquets, which the bacon jam made the dish. Then we had the chimichurri steak which was a good rendition and full flavor but was sadly served almost well done. And finally the reason I made reservations was for the chicken and red velvet waffle sliders. I was so disappointed. The waffle itself was so soggy and lacked flavor. But still we were full to say the least so we took dessert to go, one carrot cake and one white chocolate cheesecake which were both amazing!!

Once seated, our waiter arrived immediately, but only to ask us if our fourth person was coming. We replied with a yes, and before I could ask about the cocktails, he was gone. He returned just after our fourth person arrived. We all ordered drinks and they were moderately prompt with serving them to us. The cocktails come in short glasses. They were pretty tasty. but I believe they are a little skimpy on the alcohol. No big deal. We ordered 2 appetizers / small bites: Dates and Chicken Meatballs, and 2 entrees: Chicken and Salmon. After about 40 minutes of waiting our waiter returned to apologize for the delay as they had a large party upstairs. At that time, I wasn't upset about it because we were having a good conversation.  Several minutes later I began to get irritated, especially since I had an empty drink. The waiter returned with the 2 entrees but didn't offer to refill our drinks. 1 entree was incorrect but he returned with the corrected item about 5 minutes later. About 10 minutes later, after the entrees were now cold, he returned with the appetizers. This was probably the most irritating part of my night. He did mention he wanted to bring out the entrees so they didn't sit under heat lamps, but our appetizers were simple and should have been made before the entrees. I wanted to order another drink and another small bite, but was scared I'd have to wait another hour. I expressed my feelings about the wait and he sent over the manager who gave us a 25% discount off the entire bill. That was kind of him and much appreciated. Overall the vibe is nice and the staff was kind. I just think they cannot accommodate for larger parties. Maybe it was an off night or they were short handed in the kitchen. I'll give it another try because overall the food was pretty tasty and everyone was as pleasant as they could be given the circumstances.",

That alone, would be worth the distance to go to this restaurant.  But then you add in the mac-n-cheese, the French dip, pork belly and a chimichurri steak and .....MIND BLOWN.  If you're not stopping here to experience this restaurant, you're not treating yourself right.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed!  Extra perk...1/2 block away from the Fremont Experience.",

I was excited to try the oxtail empanadas but they were out of it (?????) so that was a downer from the beginning.  Their menu is not that big.  We ordered some appetizers and they were just average and they brought these at different times with long waits in between.  The main dish I ordered was the short ribs and they were ok.  My friend ordered chimichurri steak which he liked.  I would not go back.  The food is just average but the service was terrible.  Might need new management!",

To start, we ordered the vegetable empanadas, bacon wrapped dates with fig jam, charred brussel sprouts, fired corn, and of course their sangria. All tasty with distinct flavors. Our entrees included the French Dip, the Red Velvet Chicken Waffle and the Chimichurri Steak. Again, all prepared perfectly and great. The atmosphere is relaxed, casual in a non LV glitzy way which was very much appreciated. Prices were very reasonable for LV. Lastly, our server, Jonathan, was knowledgeable on all menu items, very friendly and a compliment to Therapy.  We would definitely return and would encourage others to enjoy!!",

However at the end of the meal I felt like each dish was missing something. The red velvet waffle and chicken sliders were just terrible. Lacked flavor all around. The oxtail empanadas were my favorite. However I think the kitchen may have ran out of oxtail because two of the empanadas were barely filled with oxtail. One empanada was filled with a piece of bone so be careful! Otherwise trendy ambiance, okay service but overall I feel the restaurant is overrated.",

    "text": "We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.  Just a few steps East from the Fremont Experience is a delightful , small nondescript restaurant that is not to be missed .  It's in an area that is \"re-developing\" and it is a restaurant that will appeal to a more sophisticated diner, not a Fremont Experience guzzler who loves $1.50 hotdogs.  We stopped to look at the menu and the hostess came out out to the street to greet us and induced us to give the place a try. Denise, our hostess, did an excellent job of greeting us and explaining the menu in very engaging terms.  A delightful restaurant, spacious, very well appointed, comfortable and with very attentive table service. And then there's the food... Excellent, unusual, delicious and filling. All of the food is housemade and the flavor demonstrates that. From the appetizer through to dessert the meal is a wonderful dining experience.  The Oxtail Empanadas (you get 4 small empanadas) were different, tasty and a fine appetizer. I recently had the French Dip which was excellent with tender and plentiful slices of beef and real (not salty bouillon) au jus filled with small pieces of beef. The truffle chips and the pepper chips are very good. The Chicken Fried Chicken Sub was delicious, with a large fried (not oily) chicken breast on a wonderful roll.  A very rich chocolate cake and good coffee topped off the lunch.   Full bar with a very nice beer,wine and cocktail menu.  Dinner service begins at 3PM.     The restaurant is wonderful for couples , business lunches and dinners and it has a loft area that can accommodate large gatherings . Roger, the owner, stopped by and we had a pleasant and informative chat. Our server Tracy was excellent, attentive and informative without being overbearing.  We commend Therapy to you without hesitation.",

I called and spoke with Gordon, who went out of his way to give us the best service via phone I've ever had, everything I asked for was no issue and he gave some great suggestions. I was called the day before our reservation and another gentleman reconfirmed all of my details and was extremely professional. They all went out of their way to accomodate us. Cue day of, we were taken in right away and our server Chantay was incredible! They had several huge parties before us and then during our time as well, but you would never know. Nothing was too much to ask for, she always had a smile and drinks were replenished without even asking. The staff was attentive and all of our orders came out perfect! The burrata and heirloom tomato salad and Mac and Cheese croquettes were easily a favorite, portions huge and beautifully presented. I can't say enough great things about Chantay, she truly made it look effortless when I'm sure it was stressful, everyone's bills came out split correctly and she never made us feel bad that we were high maintenance. Definitely go if in Vegas!!! Thank you for making a great night better.",

    "text": "2nd review because therapy convinced yelp to remove my first...  Ate Beef Tar Tar likely cause of hardcore food poisoning. Left me on the toilet for days and I would have been hospitalized if I didn't have many natural remedies.. Liquid bentonite clay, kombucha tea, 50 billion 24 strain probiotics,  bee propolis , royal jelly, copious amounts of pink salt water for electrolytes,  When my stomach finally calmed because of kombucha I began to be able to hold down some liquid ..I then became bed ridden with insanely ridiculous back and kidney pain and unbreakable fever left me in a pool of sweat  for 2 days.   Explosive vomiting over 35 times and diarrhea. Massive fever as well by far the sickest I have ever been.. now 1 week later I have a severe cold coughing green phlegm incessantly for days.. Important to mention  have not had a cold or flu for over 2 years previous to getting poisoned by Therapy..   I now wish I went to the hospital to gather evidence against them.  The reality was I felt too sick to get myself to hospital any way..  THESE MAMMALUKES are trying to cover up that they are getting people deathly ill.. let's see how long until they convince yelp to pull this too..  My friend who I ate with also got insanely sick. But not quite as bad as me.. he only puked and diarrhea for 12 hours or so. I guess that's what you call a lucky therapy victim..  Now for rhe food.  Beef tartar lacked seasoning was super bland and one dimensional..   Crispy pig ear is a gelatinous mess which is then coated in a thick batter and deep fried. A mushy and crunchy texture that kept my stomach turning for days just thinking about it..  Charcuterie board is a total joke. Super thin pathetic and definitely not unique selection of sliced cured meats which could be purchased from any deli. Accompanied by some standard pickles some mustard and toast points.  No one could make rillette, pate, lardo, brasaola something? That would be too much work apparently easier just to buy a meat slicer and purchase deli meats from grocery store. Absolutely zero creativity.   Empanadas were the only item we thought were good but not great.  Service was decent at the bar however had to ask for multiple water refills. And when we inquired about wines by the glass we would have been better off asking a chimp..   I want to be clear  I am not basing my food opinions on any part of the fact i got deathly ill.  Avoid this place like the plague unless you do not value your life. Especially, keep away elderly or children as they would not survive a food poisoning like therapy gave me..  Last review therapy had yelp remove it.. if my massive food poisoning didn't now turn into an awful cold I probably wouldn't have bothered to rewrite this but thanks to therapy and unlucky for therapy I am now sick in bed again with lots of free time.",

The food is good, well-prepared new American dishes. The lavash flatbread was excellent! We also tried the the special mac and cheese, but I have to admit it was nothing special.   While the food was decent, the best part was the service. Most of us were not feeling well at dinner and had gotten a little carsick in the uber ride over, but our server was incredibly accommodating and did everything he could to try to make us happy. (For example: one of my friends has a dairy allergy and he tried to get special accommodations for the chef to make the mac and cheese without the cheese.)   Good spot with something to please everyone. Also great place if you need a break from the \"Vegas\" feel.",

Let's get to the food. There's two types of dining : tapas and fork/knife plates. The food is to die for .  Started with oxtail empanadas , in the gnudi (owner recommended and I can see why!) , hanger steak tartar .   The service is great . Robert , our waiter, is so genuinely positive and calm .

We made reservations for 2 and were seated right away, although it didn't seem to get too crowded for a Saturday night. The service was a little slow too, considering the lack of crowd. But the food and drinks were very good. We splite the Gnudi, Korean BBQ Bao and side of frieds and liked it all. They forgot the fries so finally realized their mistake and brought them, free of charge. For cocktails, we had the Raspberry Rose and Downtown Manhattan. I didn't try the rose but my friend said it was good. And the manhattan was strong with just the right amount of sweetness. This decor was good too and it's a short walk from all the casinos. I would definitely give this place another chance!",

    "text": "Therapy was exactly what we needed on the night after election night!  And this place did not disappoint.  We got there around 5:30pm on a Wednesday and it was completely empty but filled up within the hour.  Happy hour was available to us (at the bar only) for another half hour so we quickly ordered some drinks at the bar and then made our way to our table in the dining area.  The place is very cute with big round cushy booths along one side of the restaurant.  I always love a small plate sharing experience and Therapy provides a small plate and an appetizer menu, so there were plenty of good choices (at least 15 to choose from).  Our group of three went for devils on horseback, ahi poke, an assortment of the house empanadas, roasted brussels, and crab dip.  Everything was delicious!  My favorites: brussels and crab dip.  The poke was a little strange as it was mixed with watermelon... I felt like the watermelon was just a filler for the ahi and the taste combination was a odd.  Everything else was really tasty and we went through every last bite of food!  A few rounds of wine, 5 small plates, and the bill was $100, including tax and tip.  Not bad!  Thanks for the much needed therapy, Therapy!",

Plus a great flavor and a nice, ever so subtle crusting.  Unfortunately, everything else was good, not great. Oxtail empanadas, ok. Chicken and red velvet waffles...mixed. Great waffle, crispy outside, and somehow melts in your mouth. And the bourbon maple syrup was perfectly balanced. But the chicken was just kind off there. I might have been just as happy if they substituted with a boneless strip from KFC.  Service, well, they try hard, but I think they need a stronger manager at the helm. We have a late reservation, knowing it would be Friday night and possible packed. Well, what good is a reservation if we end up getting served at the bar 40min later anyways? Plus you have 1 great bartender trying to mix drinks for the entire restaurant plus break away from his regular duties to take our orders. He tried, but it was obvious he was stretched thin.",

    "text": "Visited the restaurant amongst a group of 20 co-workers on Wednesday night.   We have our priorities after a day of meetings, so off to the bar we went after racing each other downtown. Came in during happy hour, which was nice for a pre-dinner cocktail. I had my beloved beer, went for a 12oz stout for $5 and a coworker got a Fuhgetaboudit. She loved it so much, she ended up ordering two more.   Dinner and appetizers came out promptly and everything was delicious. There was a shared appetizer of bacon wrapped dates and pretzels, dates got a raving review.   I had roasted cauliflower and steak tartar. Rest of my party ordered pretty much everything else on the menu and everyone was happy. Shrimp scampi smelled heavenly and pork chop looked amazing.   Had to have a house margarita, which was nice and strong, and also made me forget about looming fourth quarter.  I loved the atmosphere and most of all the owner, Roger, who was ever present in the dining room and engaged with our group all night. I especially appreciated Roger expressing his concern that food for our party would come out at varied times, we acknowledged that it was perfectly acceptable, and he coordinated it beautifully. Nice contrast to Public School we visited night before, where to our disappointment some in our party were already eating, while others barely had a chance to place their orders.   Space was great too, open and plentiful, nice updated decor.  Soundtrack could not have been better for my taste, blending Amy Winehouse and Frank Sinatra.   All in all, nice place worth checking out, welcome to DT!",

First the food  the mac and cheese was far from super it was pedestrian at best the bacon didn't enhance it at all it was one of the few times bacon didn't make it better.  Chicken meatballs, why did a chicken have to die for this?  It was basically an anti vegan falafel.  Deep fried with a mere spec of sauce. (I did like the sauce)   Last my beer, normally nothing to complain about but a fly was in it!  Ok sure it happens but it iced the cake. (the waiter did remove it)   The local who I came with was very disappointed after all the good locals reviews he started to wonder if they were paid reviews.",

We went to the bar to enjoy happy hour and it only went down from there. Our bartender was Kristina and she was the least bit attentive, and rude. Maybe it's because she's from New Jersey.... idk but she didn't make our time there enjoyable at all. It took forever for her to come to take our food order... our food sat under the heat lamps for more than a few minutes because nobody in the restaurant saw it there I guess?? The manager on the floor has to bring us out our food. The guests that came in after us got their food more timely than use when we ordered basically the same things, and they got checked on.  She had already printed our check before we even got anything, which didn't include the 20% off for their lunch menu. She said she was going to do it when we closed out, which makes no sense whatsoever. When my boyfriend and I were nearly done is when she came to check on us. We both work here in Vegas in the restaurant industry and her act was highly unacceptable. Sad to say this place could have easily gotten 5 stars since the food was delicious and reasonably priced. Will return when they have a better serviced bartender.",

Apparently he was so befuddled that he forgot to put in the rest of my order (it was two items). After I waited patiently for half an hour, my question about the missing dates was met with looks of bewilderment and utterances of \"uhhhh...\" The manager was around (his preferences in men obviated by the conformity in bar tender height, weight, facial hair and build), but was of no use. I love fried pig ears, but what the hell was that gummy pile of thumb sized batter sticks I was served? Not ears, I don't guess. And as for my missing stuffed dates, Firefly had never done anything but excellent by my account. It's worth the extra 10 minute commute from my apartment. I was so hopeful, but no, typical Las Vegas nonsense, too big for your britches. And that statement about booziness and vastness? Do better.  Update:  Well, I attempted it again, last night, Friday, December 23. The website said they were open until midnight, with the kitchen open until an hour before posted closing. There were no corrected hours posted on the door. When we walked in at 10:15, we were told we could have drinks, but not food. A fairly predictable bit in light of my previous experience. I don't even know why I tried.",

Second, the ricotta small plate was bland and had an odd texture.   The other thing id say is their signature dish, the chicken and waffles.. was okay but nothing special. Could not tell at all the waffles were red velvet.  My drink was so overmuddled with raspberries, you couldn't drink it through the mini straw they provided.  Would never come back here again.",

You look at the longevity of restaurants in this city, for example, Lotus of Siam, Yama Sushi, the environment isn't so fancy but they know how to turn tables and deliver great quality.   Our first impression into Therapy was inconvenience. We were walk-ins and the restaurant was 30% full and the tall woman with short, dark brown hair whom seems to be a manager greeted us with an abrasive attitude and asked if we had a reservation. We did not we said & I said do we need one and she whispers under her breath, yes. See we said we'd go elsewhere and she's literally saying out loud \"every reservation and times\" then grabs menus, no smile ever and drops menus.   I've opened 2 nightclubs, 2 restaurants on the strip and that kind of attitude isn't going to cut it. Manager or not, some managers try to do to much.   The food was sub-par but the meatballs were awesome but for 6 small ones, overpriced. The server room forever to drop the check too. For being such an inconvenience with no reservations you'd think they'd try to turn the table faster.",

Service was surprisingly not all that great, I.e. I had to call the waiter for refills despite the restaurant being not it all that busy.

    "text": "I decided on Therapy after another establishment I had my eyes on had over an hour wait. This place was just as busy but luckily there were two seats at the bar. Soon as we sat the bartender came and took our drink order. I had a Moscow Mule, very tasty but not in it's traditional tin mug. That didn't stop me from having a few of them. After looking over the menu my wife and I decided we were sharing for the night. -Oxtail Empanadas- four perfectly fried, crispy pastry filled with tender oxtail served with a harissa lime creme fraiche. Plenty of oxtail in these bad boys. the only regret is not ordering another order of them. -The Perfect Cure - the meat had varieties of soppressata and prosciutto while there were four selections of cheese. All were good but the creamy brie was the winner on this menu selection. They also had some house pickles and artichokes with a grilled peach jam,  cranberry crostini and some dijon and mustard seed for dipping. An excellent dish to say the least. -The Big Sexy - A Wagyu beef burger topped withlettuce, marinated tomato, brie. I had the  scallion mayo on the side and used it for the fries. the burger was very juicy and served a perfect medium rare. With the marinated tomato, creamy brie and lettuce no additional condiments were even needed. It looks like a basic, run of the mill burger but was backed with great flavors. - Sliced Chimichurri Steak  - marinated in citrus with spices and some jalapeno for kick, the tender cut of steak was melt in your mouth excellence. The chimichurri sauce and fried onion strings added on top for extra flavor and texture sealed the deal for me on this. I am glad this was one of the items we tried and I want to go back to get it again.  Service at Therapy was excellent, even sitting at the bar which was filled from one end to the other. Maybe next time I will save room for desert.",

Has been on my bookmarks list for the longest time, and we had originally planned to go somewhere else across the street, but they had decided to close earlier than what was advertised (on Yelp). Anyway...  Food was delicious. My family liked Therapy's Crab Dip (2 orders) in particular. If I remember correctly, we also had about 4 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine, Empanadas sampler, Chorizo Empanadas, Soup of the Day (chicken and veggies with added noodles), \"Ricky Ricardo,\" Filet Tartar, Sliced Chimchurri Steak, and the French Dip. Everyone pretty much shared their food fares. I should add that it was done only out of courtesy XD  Customer service was decent, but I think they might've just been extremely busy. Other than my family of 8, there were 2 other large groups around 10-11:30PM dinner service. I was happier than most in my family, but hey... It's Downtown on a Friday night, and we decided to come here last minute. I just really appreciated how patient Jonathan (sp.) was, and how he respected my wish to pick up the tab XD  If you're trying to put numbers together, I think I spent around $285-$290 that includes gratuity.",

Roger, the manager, is always gracious - always greets me by name, and treats everyone well.  The only thing missing? There were so many yummy apps that I didn't get my Big Sexy Burger - probably one of the best burgers on the planet in it's price range, and served with those yummy frites reminiscent of Bouchon's.",

Instead we found two available seats at the bar. The place stayed very busy for most if the night so reservations might not be a bad idea.   Bar staff was excellent. Very attentive. Manny was the guy, but I didn't get the name of the girl. Both were great, even though it was a very busy night.   We started off with the steak tartare. I loved it. They only brought out (4) Crostini and that was definitely not enough. Luckily, they had no issue bringing us more. The pickled beets or whatever they were tasted great.   Next we ordered the chicken meatballs and the chicken and waffles. Both were great. The Red velvet waffles were so good. Honestly, waffles usually aren't my thing. ..but this was really good. I took a small bite of just the waffle and it was heaven. I didn't really understand the little pickle garnish on top, but it looked nice. The jalapeno, cilantro pesto sauce on the chicken meatballs was simply addicting.   Since we ordered three small plates we decided to split just one entree, the hangar steak. I really liked it, but the boyfriend was hoping for a larger portion. After splitting everything I was full, but we maybe should have added another plate or a side dish of some kind. Regardless this was an excellent meal and a great place for date night.",

It came out after an hour and half. Everyone in my group had already gotten their food and ate it before my dish even came out. I was pretty hangry but the waitress kept telling me my food was still coming and that it was a thick slice of chicken. After the hour and a half my group was ready to leave after they were done eating and my dish finally came out I just told them I didn't want the chicken anymore because we were ready to leave. The waitress apologized and said they would not charge me. When the plate was in front of me it was a normal size chicken breast so I don't know why it took an hour and a half to cook. I was super petty so I was hoping it'd taste awful but the flavors were on point. If the service had been on time I probably would've given it 5 stars.",

The place was not busy at all on a Saturday night (not a good sign), yet our server would go 45 minutes without asking if we wanted drinks or needed anything. Our food took over an hour. They gave us a 10% discount for not having all of our meals out at once (roughly 10 minutes between each) I worked in restaurants for many years, and this place was clearly just run poorly - at least on the night that we came in. Don't get the beet salad - it is pretty much just a pound of goat cheese on a plate with beets with the stems still on them.",

I don't remember our servers name but he was very friendly and attentive, as well as the busser and food runner.   We were hungry so we chose 7 things to try on the menu. The heirloom tomato and burrata salad had baby beets in it and everything together was just great. Very juicy and refreshing. The oxtail empanadas were great as well, full of flavor with a tasty dipping sauce to accompany it. The roasted street corn was pretty addicting, and I ended up eating some of my friends half because I liked it that much. The aioli mixed with Parmesan cheese went very well together. My friend loved the crab dip; it had a good amount of crab topped with melted parm on top with a side of tortilla chips. Chicken meatballs and brussel sprouts were good but not anything amazing. My absolute favorite of the bunch was the Devils on Horseback which was truffled goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. I love anything truffle and this was delicious. It also paired really well with the romesco sauce it came with.   We had a couple of desserts but their most popular one is the s'mores dessert and I can honestly say it was fantastic. Very rich and filling, but worth it.   Overall, we had a wonderful dinner. I was a little sad because there were so many other things on the menu I wanted to try, BUT this gives me a great reason to come back and try everything else!",

The menu looks amazing and the space is one of the nicer environments for dinner in the downtown area. If you do find yourself here as you stumble across this review please find solace in the fact that woke nothing was awe inspiring, nothing was also awful...in fact certainly nothing that a couple drinks couldn't help you believe was actually very good...heck while you're at it order a shot too,it could turn out to be amazing...still, in the end, I'll probably pass on Therapy in the future.",

    "text": "So this swaggy bar/restaurant is located at the very end of the Fremont experience. Once you cross the street & are away from the hustle & bustle you will find this restaurant & you will be very glad you did!  Our 4 person party was seated at one of 2 tables fronting the kitchen which gave us the best seat to watch for our food. My friends started with 2 Bloody Mary's & a mimosa ( I'm not a fan of day drinking). I was peer pressured into trying the gigantic Bloody Mary topped with a huge piece of bacon, green olives & a slice of goat cheese soaked in red wine. Since we had read such great reviews we decided to order a lot & share it amongst ourselves. Our group ordered the red velvet chicken & waffle sliders, the BLT, the French Dip, chicken fried chicken sub & an order of their brussel sprouts. Yes, yes I know what you're thinking, how are 4 kids from Hawaii going to grind all this food? We were hangry, so it was quite easy!   Everything was amazing, but my favorite was the red velvet sliders. It was literally the perfect combination. The chicken was so juicy & not overly breaded so it went great with the red velvet waffles. I am so glad I decided to order this instead of the portobello sandwich. Thanks Ezekiel for doing a great job! He was so nice to talk to & always made sure we were doing okay!  I highly recommend making your way past the safety net of the Fremont experience & head down to Therapy. I can see where they got their name. Once I took a bite of their food I knew it was exactly what I needed to take a break from losing money.",

I opened my Yelp app to see what good restaurants we can walk to, and Therapy was one of the top ones. We didn't make a reservation but were still able to get a table for two in no time, in spite of the restaurant looking full and busy. Lucky us! We ordered a couple cocktails, Korean pork belly sliders, roasted duck, and for desserts, carrot cake and s'mores on a cast iron. Everything was delicious, especially the Korean pork belly sliders. My only minor complaint was that the carrot cake was crumbled. I was anticipating and definitely preferred a non-crumbled whole carrot cake that I can slice into and eat. The crumbled cake wasn't mentioned on the menu and I was a bit taken aback when it was served. Nonetheless, this place is definitely worth a visit when in downtown Las Vegas. It is conveniently right off the Fremont Street Experience. The restaurant has a nice industrial decor, the food and drinks are top notch and the servers are attentive, fast and nice.",

A simple and eloquent invite, got me and my fiancee to re-visit therapy. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful hosted that seated us in a very nice table with the view of the entire restaurant. Moments later Chelsea our server came and began what was a delightful evening by catering to our every need. She took the time to explain the menu and some of the new items in it. From water to answering questions, dessert or coffee she manifested the improvement I was inform of.  The food goes without saying a delightful culinary cuisine that I have experience before. My fiancee found herself reminiscing of her moms original Mexican heritage with Shrimp Ceviche; \"Best ceviche in town, just like my mom makes it\". I myself, found myself captivate my the Grilled Octopus a delicious new dish that wow my taste buds.   Over all our commitment to stay and \"Therapy\" was win over by the subtle  but impressive change made to meet customer satisfaction.",

    "text": "Updated review here:  For some reason, I always end up at Therapy when friends are visiting because it's just so easy so I guess this is a nice place to take out of towners. Parking this time was a b$6#@ but our waiter JASON was so wonderful as to give us an insider tip. Sorry, yelpers. I can't tell you the secret. Guess you'll have to go and ask JASON next time you're dining there. Thanks, JASON. You da best!  Between the 4 of us, with no drinks, our tab was around $90 before tip. No bad.  We ordered the Oxtail Empanadas, Chimichurri Steak, Crab Dip, Caesar Salad and another salad. Can we talk about this Ceasar salad again? I don't know why but I am addicted to the Ceasar salad here. It's just so simple with just enough dressing. I think it's because they cut the romaine lettuce into perfectly bite size pieces. You know when you have to shove a big piece of lettuce into your mouth? It's just not cute!   Anyways, I think this place is going to be on my regular list pretty soon. Thanks for a wonderful evening, JASON!  ***  Honestly, I love this place because it's a cool hipster hangout spot. (I'm sorry if this is offensive to you) I love the warehouse feel with the high ceilings and ventilation ducts? I really don't know what those are for but it looks industrial and cool. And their chairs! Who doesn't love to have dinner while sitting in nice chairs! So important! I also like the waiters and bartenders here. They make strong drinks and are dressed REAL NICE.   This scene is definitely my kind of vibe. This is a great place to catch up with an old friend for drinks and appetizers. A lot of it will be on the heavier side. One of the dishes we ordered was the CEVICHE. It was recommended to us but it wasn't my favorite thing. Guess I'm just used to the old traditional way rather than a new twist. All good, though. Everything else we had was spectacular, including my CEASAR SALAD. No really. It was a really good caesar salad. Just the way I expect it to be!",

Not once did we get checked in to see if we needed anything so we couldn't tell the waitress we were missing all our alcoholic beverages that came seconds before food as the bartender was too busy flirting with the guys at the bar. Drinks came, food came and we were still missing one drink which we couldn't get the waitress attention to let her know. We finished our meals and waited for the check that seemed like an eternity. We did nothing but wait for a long time for everything. There was a guy with a purple shirt running around like a chicken with his head cut off.

    "text": "I do have to say that I'm torn between a 3.5 star rating or a 4 star rating when it comes to Therapy. So I guess you can say it's somewhere in the middle there. Therapy offers a classier than your usual Fremont restaurant atmosphere. It is definitely fancier and nicer looking than a lot of the restaurants you find on Fremont street, especially so close to the Fremont Street Experience area.   I've been to Therapy about two times now. The first time was short -- we only ordered the crispy fried pig ears and the fire roasted street corn. Along with those, we ordered two drinks.. the smash and the devil eyes. The pig ears were delicious. It was fried perfectly with some yummy seasoning .. it was on the saltier side of things. If you have had pig ears before, it's pretty gelatinous when you eat them deep fried. The cartilage is also not as hard as they usually are. They're pretty much melted. The fire roasted street corn was amazingly delicious. That lime aioli that goes with it is just perfect. It adds just enough of a tang to the corn. The drinks, on the other hand, was nothing to write home about. The flavors were missing and the watered down alcohol is the only thing that sticks in my memories.  The second time we went, we ordered the crispy fried pig ears, the fire roasted street corn, mixed mushroom flatbread, and the \"big sexy.\" The crispy fried pig ears were a miss this time around. They were essentially burnt with no flavor. We had to get them to remake it for us and even when they remade them, it was still not as good as the first visit. It had too much batter with little to no seasoning. The fire roasted street corn was still very delicious. The mixed mushroom flatbread was amazingly delicious. The poached egg on the flatbread just brought all the flavors together in a whirlwind of tastyness. The \"big sexy\" .. the meat in the burger is very well seasoned. The tomato that they used and the brie that they used was definitely a different spin on everything. Overall, it meshed in perfectly.   We sat upstairs during our second visit and the service was slow. I guess no one wants to walk the stairs! Haha. Therapy is a good place to try some out of the ordinary food. However, the prices are a bit on the high side. Four pieces of corn for $8? Yeah, talk about steep for certain things that you can get for less than a dollar. Nonetheless, it's still a decent place just to grab a bite or two with a group of friends.",

We ordered drinks and they were just okay, my sangria tasted a lot like syrup. Definitely not worth the price of the drink, but I guess downtown that's to be expected. Our food was really good! 5/5 for sure. We shared the oxtail empanadas, brussel sprouts, and mac-n-cheese. I would recommend adding something to the pasta since it was very plain but still flavorful. We had dessert too which was excellent. Our main complaint was the atmosphere. We found it confusing, whether it was nice dining, a sports bar, or a night club. It was very dark inside and the music was so loud, and it was top-40 style dance music. Not something I want when I'm paying $100 for some drinks and small plates. We will probably come back again because the food was really good and the variety of the menu would be perfect for any type of eater. I would probably order wine next time and make sure to sit close to my husband so we are not shouting at one another at the table.",

As soon as I walked in, I was presented with the fresh ambiance of a casual yet classy all American pub. We were greeted by the general manager, Maria, who took the time to have a conversation with us while suggesting certain items on the menu. She was helpful and pleasant to talk to. She checked up on us from time to time and made sure our first time there would be nothing short of an amazing dining experience. It took me a while to decide what to eat because everything sounded delicious. I decided to go with  the shorty which was a braised short rib. Once it was handed to me, my mouth started salivating. It was tender and cooked to perfection. The bar manager Kristina had made me their signature gin cocktail, fly me to the moon, and not only was the drink great, but she also made us feel like welcome. Kristina is very personable and definitely has a talent when it came to bartending. Kristina was walking back and forth behind the bar all night making and dropping off drinks and can I just say that both the front and back view were sights I'll never forget. Although the restaurant was busy, the staff still took their time in talking to their customers and making sure everything was up to par. To say that this place has exceeded my expectations is an understatement.",

Today, there were no other options for us to go for lunch and was kinda \"forced\" to eat here. Glad we did! While I can agree it is expensive, I believe it is worth it because the portions are huge and it is delish! Do try the Empanada Trio to include the Oxtail. Mac and Cheese is truly cheesy and creamy, one of the top Mac n Cheese I've had. Also ordered the Ceviche, they have their own take on it. I can't say it's the best, but it's quite good. The portions are so huge I didn't get to eat my main meal (which I'm going to share with my daughter), BLT, we had a bite of the chips that came with it and it was great and peppery. The only thing I would change is the bread used for the BLT, they use croissant. It's still good overall. If we are to go back, I'll order less appetizers and just go for the fried chicken sub, which looked amazing when it passed me by.",

The popcorn was a disappointment for $7..way to small of a portion.  Empanadas were average.  Steak Tar tar was outstanding and all the flavors meshed well together.  Mac and cheese was also a hit.  In all, the appetizers were solid but the portions were too small for the price.  Draft beers - Not sure if it was me but the draft beer glasses looked to be a 12 oz pour and should be 16oz pints.  Also the wine and cocktails pours looked short..mgmt please review.  Strip maybe can get away with this but not downtown.  Entrees were spot on.  I had the best kale salad ever, and im normally not a kale salad fan.  The Char took it to another level.  Everyone else at the table was pleased with their entrees.  Burger, French Dip, Flat bread, and Caesar salad from what I remember  Desserts were to die for.  Had the Smores and the carrot cake which the server talked us into.  So glad she did because its not your typical carrot cake...much better and executed.  The service was perfect and the staff was always there if you needed anything without being intrusive.  Nice addition to the DTLV dining scene.",

My wife and I were visiting the LV area for the weekend with two great friends and decided to have dinner here on a Friday night. We were seated in a very comfortable spacious booth with a great view of the excellently appointed dining hall-like atmosphere. We started with wonders gin cocktails mixed with muddled fresh blackberries (our server's recommendation) and shared both a chorizo empanada and chicken meatball appetizer that were incredible! After another cocktail, my wife and I started with undoubtedly the best Caesar salad  we've ever had. Even though the menu is filled with tempting delights, our table settled on four different entrees. Our friends had the French Dip sandwich (OMG) and the Therapy Salad (generous portion and ultra fresh). My wife ordered the Red Velvet Chicken and Waffles (probably the best thing at the table--delicious!), and I tried the Wagyu Beef Burger with a fried egg and bacon on top (no words to describe except YUM!). We also had sides of the loaded mashed potatoes and 4 cheese mac--insanely good! This meal would have been $200 elsewhere (and worth it!) but it was literally half of that. I have been in the restaurant and food business for over 30 years and Therapy was one of the best meals I've ever had. Service great! Ambiance lively and great! Chef Talen's menu, quality, and presentation is to die for!!",

We ordered Brussel sprouts, crab artichoke dip, man n cheese with chicken, and shrimp scampi,, well crab artichoke was great, the Brussel sprouts were WAYYY over cooked!! Yes it says \"char\" but they were ovvvver char for sure .. burnt crisp that's all u could taste!!! Then the man n cheese tasted like the white shells u buy in a box no extra flavor at all.. that was $11 PLUS $7 for a tiny piece of chicken!! So $18 mac n cheese u can make at home! Nothing special! Thennnn the shrimp scampi came out, my friends dig into the first shrimp, then saw MOLD on the shrimp!!! We called the waitress over she said it looked DISGUSTING and was as shocked as we were!  So the manager comes over, says okay well we took those items off but the Brussel sprouts are supposed to be \"charred\" and also that shrimp we char those too so that was a char mark, no other shrimp was \"charred\" Omg since when is a char mark in a circle and a green black color?? He just made an excuse and blamed it on charring.. basically didn't even say sorry..   The only good thing about this place is location atmosphere and our waitress took good care of us. Other than that, u would get better food elsewhere DONT WASTE UR MONEY THE FOOD IS NOT WORTH IT AND ARE TINY OVER PRICED PORTIONS!",

This place was quite when we arrived and packed when we left, a really good sign.  DownTown Vegas needs to be acknowledged for all the good change that has been happening and how much better we feel going there. Each time its drawing a great crowd, and I hope these new restaurants  that are taking a chance know that we appreciate the efforts that the downtown project has produced and we appreciate them as well.  I see nothing but it getting better for Therapy and others in the future.  As we sat at the bar and saw the Therapy tee's for sale my hubby and I came up with a new logo for the tee.... it should say IVE BEEN TO THERAPY IN VEGAS .... and loved it..",

There isn't many servers who are very eager to thoroughly explain each dish but so far in my life, Joanne is probably the best server i have encountered, all the recommendation she made was on point!   I would definitely come back to this place when I visit vegas again.

The Philly arrived and the chips were totally unseasoned.  When I asked for new plantains the manager asked me what was wrong?  I said they are clearly burnt.  sha asked if I wanted more since these seems overcooked. I said yes and quite a while later another set arrived burnt.

I took bites of some of the other meals my family members got, and everything was excellent. This is the best restaurant experience I have had in a very long time.   Oh, and we did bring our kids (8 and 10). I wouldn't bring kids much younger. This isn't the type of restaurant that has coloring pages and crayons or a kids' menu. But for us, this wasn't a problem. My daughter got mashed potatoes minus some of the toppings, and my son got a dry cheeseburger (The Sexy, swapped in cheddar and omitted all other toppings and sauces).",

Let me start by saying, this place had the perfect relaxed and industrial feel that I was looking for. We had a party of 35 and they accommodated us up in their loft, which was absolutely perfect.   The food was amazing. I ordered the mac n' cheese croquettes as an appetizer and shared them with my bride's maids. They were absolutely delicious, and the three of us enjoyed every single bite. My main entree was the french dip, and I wasn't disappointed. It was delicious and the housemade chips complimented it perfectly.   On top of the great atmosphere and the delicious food, the staff was extremely helpful. They were able to answer all of our questions about the drinks, and they managed our group with ease.   All in all, this place gets a very confident 5 star rating, and I'll definitely be back the next time I visit Vegas.   Thanks again, Peggy for coordinating this so easily, and thanks to the staff for handling our party with no issue. You guys are amazing!",

Located on the nicer, more low-key section of the ever emerging \"new\" Fremont area, Therapy is a good spot for dinner whether it be for pleasure or business. We went last night with two other couples and had a great table in the back by the kitchen. Our server was super friendly, attentive and accommodating.  Food was fantastic. We ordered apps, chicken meatballs with cilantro-jalapeno pesto, goat cheese stuffed dates, tuna tartare and chorizo empanadas.  Salads were Cesar and the delicious beet salad.  Dinner selections were salmon, fried chicken and red velvet waffles, roasted chicken with garlic mashed potatoes, Cuban sandwich, and fried mac and cheese croquettes with a spicy aioli. Sides were fries, mac and cheese, and loaded potato mash. Dessert was the chocolate-banana bread pudding and the s'mores skillet.  Everything was delicious, and we'd definitely return.  Total for food and cocktails, (minus tip) was $400-ish.",

    "text": "I was really hoping this place would warrant a five star review. It's close to work and part of the revitalized area of Fremont Street downtown near the Fremont Street Experience. I had a lunch date with a few friends and co-workers I hadn't seen in a while, so I was primed and ready to go. A short walk through the brisk mid-morning air had us all hungry and ready to get our grub on. We arrived shortly after their 11:30 opening time and were the only patrons in the restaurant. We were seated promptly and that's where the promptness ended.   I never figured out if one of our waitresses was in training or if there just wasn't enough to do, but multiple servers for our party of seven added to the confusion and lengthy lunch. The menu referenced \"lunch\", but the lunch specials are not listed on the menu. Had a few members of our party not been there before, I don't think we would have known about the lunch specials listed on the Therapy website. I opted for the French Dip lunch special which consisted of half a sandwich, french fries and a soda. The quality of the food is what is keeping this review a float. The french fries were outstanding and the French Dip was packed with meat and flavor. There is no ketchup on the table, so you are at the mercy of your server to put it in one of those little stainless steel cups and place it on your plate. Somehow I managed to be the only one who missed out on the ketchup. DL quickly rectified the situation and requested some from the server. Although the server took my soda order, it never arrived, and by the time I got her attention, the meal was winding down.  Our party was fairly diverse when it came to lunch choices with everything ranging from the Beet Salad, to the Chicken Fried Sub and the Super Mac. The lunch special, after tax, was just north of ten bucks, so this kind of Therapy won't break the bank. TD ordered a salad with his Super Mac, but probably should have just ordered dessert instead, as the salad must have been hanging out with my soda, as it too arrived at the end of the meal.  I will be back for another round of Therapy and hope any kinks they may have had with the service are worked out. If you are headed there for lunch and have any sort of time constraint to make it back to work, you might want to seek alternatives or at least be prepared to come up with some excuse for the boss man on why you are late. From arrival to departure we were there is excess of 90 minutes, much of which can be attributed to the service. All things considered, it was just an OK experience.",

It almost feels like you are eating in a local neighborhood.  We sat right by the window and enjoyed all the people watching.  Good, classic Gourmet American type food.  Definitely try the crab dip--I will fly back to Vegas just for the crab dip.  We also had the Crostini, which has an interesting preparation.  Little pillows of ricotta baked together in stoneware and topped with fig jam and nuts.  You then scoop it onto delicious bits of crostini.  Split the Shrimp Scampi which was perfect.  Our server was nice enough to split it and was perfect after all the heavy food of Vegas.  Wine is reasonably priced and a good selection. Such a BETTER value when compared to the Strip.  And the food here was much tastier, better presented and in a better atmosphere when compared to a much more expensive, disappointing meal on the Strip. Shout out to Jason, who was an excellent server.  Pleasant, on the ball and checked on us often without being intrusive.",

That's fine though. We really were excited to see what all the hype on the food was. And we weren't disappointed!! My wife and I split three menu items and were so impressed. The best was the BIG SEXY burger. Damn that was delicious!!! Perfectly prepared!! Only complaint would be the caliber of drinks on the menu.

For the main course I ordered the bone-in pork chop and my companion ordered the shrimp scampi. Unfortunately my pork chop was overcooked, which made it hard for me to enjoy it even though they did an amazing job preparing the rest of the dish. The service was kinda spotty, maybe due to the large crowd that evening. We really had to work hard to get her attention when needed. There's a lot of other dishes I'd like to come back to and try, so I'd give them another chance to try and change my opinion of the place.",

This is where things took a turn for the worse. We waited thirty minutes to get our empanadas and only after we asked the server. Next the flatbread. Both dishes were awesome and tasted better than expected. We had to ask the server again for the pork sliders which he was surprised we hadn't got. We finally got the sliders after an hour of waiting. Last, we had the carrot cake and ice cream which was also delicious. The service was slow and forgetful but in the end he took two of the meals off. I would eat here again because the food was delicious.",

We got the pork chop which was overcooked, the salmon had a good crispy skin but was salty, the ahi tuna was salty, and the Ricky Ricardo sandwich just tasted like a mustard sandwich. The beers took so long to get to our table that they were lukewarm by the time that they got to us. The table next to us were so fed up with waiting that they left even after waiting such a long time to get to their table. They were probably understaffed. Never again.",

Perfect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside waffle . The Crispy chicken inside the sandwich had the prefect crunch and juicy chicken inside. With a spicy kind if slaw which is to die for if you like a bit of kick. My next favorite was the fried Mac! Honestly wow crispy outside and ooey goey inside with a spicy tomatoe jam sauce. If you love spice definitely order one or two if your selfish. The meat and cheese platter is also a really good starter if you want something lite and tangy. The Bellini Mimosa also really good not crazy strong and the perfect amount of peach. Honestly you won't be disappointed. And what a great fun party atmosphere.",

    "text": "Needing to escape therapy is usually a cure!  Cheers to the cure of therapy.  Therapy can come in many different forms, I plan to release some of my problems and woes in the bottom of a glass. That's right the glass started full, then got to half full, and finally empty. Am I cured? Let's find out. Another round if you please! Where else can one get a shot of therapy? Only in Vegas! Spencer will be my guide!  My most current issues melt away as I seek more and more shots of therapy. But let me explain, the therapy that I am experiencing comes in a shot glass, and is the flavor of pineapple upside down cake. My fabulous waiter Spencer is whom is administering my shots of therapy. Therapy is the name of the restaurant that I am enjoying. Who can go wrong with a restaurant that has been on the travel channel? Foodies have spoken, so here I sit gaining some light to the darkness that has filled my last few days.   One would never expect the style and class from the outside of building that Therapy calls its own! Trust me some of the best restaurants that I have enjoyed have the plainest outside decoration. Simple is best in my books. It's the quality of the food and experience that I am seeking. My visit was during the off hours when they are not very busy. Not too many seeking therapy at the moment. My guide through therapy is the amazing Spencer. He is going places and as my guide was more than helpful during my recent session. Assured that he was compensated well for his time too!  The menu that Therapy has to offer is way over the top! The sheer elegance of all of their sampling's are quite spectacular. Looking for just simple sampling's the fabulous Spencer advised me that most of the appetizers will fulfill these needs. Plus what ever was left over I could take home for later. The cuisine is truly no joke here. I cannot get over how special this restaurant really is. The menu here could stand beside most of those four star restaurants on the strip too. While the menu here is five stars the prices are those of a four star restaurant. Let's just say that while happy hour is advertised at the bar on beer and a few cocktails; it is not offered on their food. The quality of the food is that delicious and amazing that individuals pay full price every visit regardless!   If only there were more Spencer's in the world; it would be a much happier place. Spencer was genuine, warm, and cheerful making my visit here count. After having the day I was experiencing, Spencer returned that smile back to me. He helped through the whole ordering process with each of his recommendations perfect. The drinks that he brought were so delicious. In fact, Spencer offered me some other drink choice if I did not like what I choose. Where does that happen? Especially, if it's a customer mishap. The policies of Therapy are exceptional superb since they allow the employees to ensure that customers are happy, no matter what!   Now that we have covered the glorious customer service here, let's visit shall we, what I had to eat!  I sampled the Charred Brussels but with added bacon, and Devils on Horseback. Let me tell you, if you enjoy bacon, then they have you covered. Bacon is an incredible option as an add on for $3.00. Go ahead, get the bacon and spoil yourself. The charred Brussels with bacon were amazing. They were perfectly cooked too. The devil did not visit me, but it felt like I was sinning while eating this. The plate takes date and cooks them then the red wine sauce they come in is dangerously delightful. Then to wrap these devils bites up bacon is wrapped around it. Oh these are a must try. My drinks were the fabulous therapy shots which truly tastes like pineapple upside cake! Beyond these shots I enjoyed a Mezcali, which they make beautifully.   Now that my therapy session is coming to an end, we missed a piece that's essential. Yes, dessert. The dessert menu is not stellar here, but the few delicious desserts they offer are outstanding! I had Carrot Cake done therapy style. This is a mind blowing dessert. The carrot cake has the option of adding bacon too. Not wanting too many extra calories I passed on bacon for my carrot cake. The dessert is presented as cake crumbles with cream cheese at the end of each side, and topped off with walnuts and vanilla ice cream on top. There is even a real mini carrot too. Delicious truly, best cheese cake concept I have ever seen!   My session with Spencer is now over. Feeling fantastic I pass on this wisdom to you: Therapy is a great time, with enthusiastic employees, and delicious food. Come and try a therapy session for yourself.",

    "text": "I spent a lot of time trying to choose restaurants that we wanted to try in Las Vegas. Being a foodie in a foodie city, this was a like an oasis to try new things. Naturally I turned to Yelp to look for a new experience. We booked Therapy a couple of weeks ago in anticipation of an awesome meal! The reviews were glowing!  We came for brunch/lunch on a Sunday and went with some of the recommendations: Chicken and Waffles slider (waffles are red velvet) and chicken fried chicken sandwich. The chicken and waffles slider looked awesome but was underwhelming when eaten. The chicken was great and the waffles were good but both had such subtle flavors that when eaten together, they canceled each other out essentially. The chicken fried chicken was good but not stunning. The bread to chicken ratio just needed some extra flavoring to make it pop. the spicy mayo provided didn't quite hit the spot. The chicken could use a bit of moistening and something to jump out at you. the truffle, parmesan fries were good though.  In the end, this was a 3 star experience for us. The service was great especially considering they were running a full joint with only 3 or 4 main waiters. Therapy is located in Downtown Vegas so away in the strip. Just take an Uber there because I think parking can be a challenge.",

Glad we added this restaurant to our list of places to try!  First off we were able to easily make reservations ONLINE instead of calling, which I loveddd For appetiizers, we ordered the Fred and Mark Croquetes $14 , which is 3 pieces of mac&cheese (deep fried as a croquette) served in a pool of tomato bacon jam with sriracha aioli spread over the croquette only.  Although this was incredibly delicious, both my fiance and I didn't care for the tomato bacon jam it sat in.  We did finish off the croquettes itself tho!   We also ordered the Gnudi $13.  It came with 6 pieces of bread and a baked ricotta cheese spread.  There was a heavy spread of fig jam over the cheese, which my fiance thought was too sweet. Personally I still liked it but less would've been better.    For the entree we ordered the Senor Shorty $24 which was short rib seated in the middle of two pieces of bread? with black beans and corn.  It was unique and delicious as well.    Service was excellent too! our server kept checking up on us making sure everything was ok.  I definitely liked this restaurant and I wish I had come here less stuffed! Will definitely return with an empty stomach!!!",

Great service, great food, and great prices.",

My friend and I shared several appetizers and had wine. We had the Brussels sprouts, In the Gnudi, and the Mexican Street corn. All 3 were amazing. My personal favorite were the Brussels sprouts. The street corn was delightful and In the Gnudi is a cheese dish...don't ask it was amazing. If you're a local, go. And if you're visiting my fine city please go and enjoy. Therapy is is one of the best places that Vegas has to offer.",

The chorizo empanadas were very good. We wanted there to be more of them.  The Devils on horseback which were the bacon wrapped dates were pretty good as well. The sauce didn't seem to go with the dates though. It was like a tomato sauce.   When I got my drink it all went downhill from there. It was the \"Fremont on East\" which was pretty delicious but there was barely enough. It was in a small glass and the ice was filled all the way up, like 10 sips or less. And when I told the waitress about it, she just said \"well maybe you should get another one.\" Not cool... The Red velvet chicken and waffles was a disaster. The waffles have no taste. And the second waffle on the bottom was extremely soggy and mushy. It was unedible. And there was very little chicken. The coleslaw that was in the middle didn't really go with the dish.   Last but not least the S'mores was actually pretty good. But, we both burned our tongue on it. It's extremely hot and bubbly and even though we ordered it from the beginning, it took a long time to bring it out. I think maybe she just forgot about it. The waitress wasn't terrible but she wasn't that great either. It was a very short Hispanic lady with thick eyeliner. She could've been much nicer and friendlier. Rear the other reviews. That's what I did before I came here and that's why I avoided the crab dip and other things. See for yourself.",

I got the Al Pastor tacos - they were good but I'd get something else if I'm able to go again. My friend is a vegetarian and got the veggie empanadas, she was very happy with her choice.

I was quite excited because the yelp review was positive and they seem to have selection of pub foods, and dinner entrees. We came in on a Thursday hoping for a great dining experience. Sadly, it was disappointing.   The stars I gave them is for their food. Our server Gloria was the best. I love their overall customer service. I really appreciate her taking care of our table with good details during our time there.   I ordered starters to begin. Steak tartare and Parmesan truffle fries. Hands down therapy serve the best fries I ever had. I would totally recommend those. Steak tartare came in a very small portion in a mason jar. The portion was surprisingly very small considering the price $17.   Moving on to their entree. Their sexy burger underdelivered. Buns were dry, and their meat was not as juicy as I expected them to be. I ordered my duck entree medium rare $26, and half of the breast came somewhat right and the other pieces were completely hard and overdone. I overheard the table next to mine also had the same issue with their medium rare request on a steak taken back to the kitchen because it was well done.   There's an apparent discord with front customer facing and the kitchen end at this restaurant. I'm not sure if I came in on an off day for the kitchen, but I spent a little over $80 for a dinner meal here and left disappointed.",

We had the pork bao which was authentically prepared with spicy kimchee. The crab and artichoke dip with warm chips was excellent. We really liked the signature salad which was made with crisp greens and a perfect light dressing. Friends raved about the stuffed dates. The brussel sprouts were good although laden with fattening nuts and cheese.  My husband loved the pork chop and appreciated the gluten free designations on the menu. The only blip and a bad one was the duck confit. Highly recommended by the server it was so salty it tasted like meat on a salt lick. Unfortunately, it was my entree. The duck looked strangely dried out when presented, that explains it. In reading prior reviews there are lots of complaints about the overly salty duck. I have made duck confit. Chef - if you must brine the duck, rinse thoroughly prior to rendering the fat. Better yet just remove it from the menu.",

Then we waited and our food came out before our drinks had shown up. I had ordered the truffle fries instead of the chips that came with my order. My order came out with the chips no truffle fries. I asked for the fries they brought me reg fries. The last thing the waitress said was well we didn't expect to be busy at lunch on a weekend in Vegas. All I can say is I'm glad the food was good but their service leaves something to be desired.",

Super Mac - Again can't go wrong with this...  Filet Tartar - Fire and on par with most beef tartars...  Shrimp Scampi - That sauce was very good and the shrimp were generous portions...  Scottish Salmon - Can't believe it wasn't butter! Rich and smooth   Jocelyn's Organic Lemon & Herb Chicken - That chicken I had was cooked to perfection. You know it was cooked well when you get past the skin and the chicken still has the same flavor and not the only seasoned on the outside bs...

I emailed them for a reservation of 14 for dinner a few weeks before our trip and it was totally fine. Very prompt response. They sat us on a long table and we decided to split the check three ways inside our group to make ordering a little easier.   Parking: They don't have a parking lot, but you can probably find street parking somewhere close by.   Ambiance: Clean, trendy, welcoming. Slightly dim.   Food:  - Roasted Street Corn: Their take on elote. So good! We kept talking about it on the way back, It's a must get. It was so yummy that we got another order.  - Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Sliders: These are actually kind of large. I was trying to figure out how to eat it without getting my lipstick everywhere. It was pretty tasty, but I do remember the chicken being a little dry. We cut each side in half and shared between the four of us in our mini group.  - Shrimp Ceviche: Really yummy! Not too acidic either. I was a fan. Shrimp was nice and  fresh too.  - Korean BBQ Porkbelly: So delicious and mouth-watering. Must order! - In The Gnudi: I was sort of surprised by how much I liked this dish. It was a nice break from all the savory since it was also sweet. I'd def order this again. - Big Sexy: The patty was juicy and it the bun was nice and wasn't soggy.   Cocktails:  - Nice and strong. I was able to try \"The Smash\" and \"St. Therapy\". Both were really refreshing and had good flavors.   -Service: The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because they messed up our check 3 times (which took about 20 minutes to rectify) and I was getting agitated because we were on a tight schedule. Our waiter was very nice though and he checked in on us in a timely manner. Also, the host was really nice too. He was able to accommodate our large party even when I called to change our reservation to an earlier time.   TL;DR: Totally going to be coming to this place when I can. Also told my friends who just moved here to check it out. The corn is awesome.",

I ordered the The French Dip, which came out on a grilled hoagie roll - which gave it a crisp bite, but enough soft-insides to be good for soaking up au jus. The only thing I did not like about the French Dip was the au jus served alongside it. It was much more gravy-like than au jus, so the bread didn't soak it up very well. When I think of a French Dip, I want regular au jus to soak into the bread, not just a dipping sauce. However, I have to admit the gravy had great, deep flavor, and the meat inside the sandwich was succulent, with very little fat. Chips came with the sandwich, and were crunchy, salty, and tasty.  Overall I was impressed at their lunch offerings. I would certainly go back. Prices are a little on the high side (especially for lunch), but the food is quality.",

Where do you traditionally get red velvet waffles and fried chicken or oxtail empanadas, French dips and burger ok.   The food is good and atmosphere is pleasant, but I do have a few quibbles to air. Cole slaw with chicken and waffles is a nice idea but poorly executed here ( either too old or too finely cut to maintain any texture) the French dip has some of the finest meat available (and I'm a butcher) but the Demi (not au jus) is straight up number 10 can of knorr powder. Grilled carrots are uninspiring and over use of arugula garnish plagues many dishes.  But with some wise choosing on your part and solid dinning experience with a stellar server in Krysten",

Here are my quick hits on food.... - Oxtail Empanadas - Loved them! The sauce had some delicious creamy heat!  -Roasted Cauliflower - The dates were the best part, the cauliflower was fine but a tiny bit blah in the flavor department.  -Mac & Cheese - Truffleliscious! It was really awesome, the smoked bacon was a great add.  -Street Corn - I loved it! a bit too citrusy for other peeps on the table, so I ate theirs! YUM!  -Gnudi - Very tasty!  We all decided we would happily go back any time! The dining room is sexy and comfortable, the food is truly social!",

We got the chicken waffles, which was bland as hell; the Brussel sprouts were whatever; the fire roasted carrots were decent.   Our second server had the decency to apologize for everything which meant a lot. But took forever to refill my Diet Coke. Sigh",

The food was amazing and definitely the type of feel I was looking for. The staff was great, very friendly. Our waitress, Georgie was extremely cheerful and definitely made our experience fun. She actually seemed to genuinely enjoy where she worked and was on top of it the whole time. She was even able to recommend things around town we didn't know about. We didn't have dessert but overall it was a great experience. We will definitely be coming back next time we're in town!",

Walking distance from the Container Park. A fresh look for Downtown with good lighting and high ceilings. The private loft on the 2nd floor gives it a VIP feel that's perfect for a group or larger party. The bar is comfortable with a wide variety of drinks including a few frozen cocktails - try the frozen mango sangria, spa looking with fresh fruit garnish- refreshing and smooth. Lots of parking near by and tons of foot traffic around.",

I tried the salmon which was incredible (wish I can go back eat it while typing this haha). The ambiance is incredible they were playing very good EDM music. The wagyu burger and fries were delicious as well! Will go back :)",

    "text": "THIS PLACE WAS LIT last Saturday night.  We walked here from another place around the corner after finding it on a quick yelp search. We were seated immediately, but at the very last available table available in the entire place snuggly set up in between two other tables so close we felt like we were on a double date with the couple to my left, lol!  Normally this might have bothered me, but I actually found it to be a little fun.    We ordered the deep fried brussel sprouts and the mac and cheese croquettes.  Since it was so busy, food was coming out slowly and we found out that the kitchen ran out of the  mac croquettes shortly before our table neighbors got what was probably the last batch delivered to their table.  My wife and I had a good laugh, because of course they'd run out and we'd have to watch the table next to us enjoy the last batch!   I'm not mad though, the deep fried sprouts were fantastic!  In lieu of the croquettes we ordered a side of mac and cheese, which was delicious, but since it was a side, didn't have any frills- but still very delicious.     Service was good, despite the big crowds and the long waits, we were checked on regularly and taken care of well.  Overall I liked this place.  I think I will like it better if I ever get a chance to come here when it isn't packed, but I understand- it was a Saturday night in Vegas on a holiday weekend.  I'm impressed they held it together as well as they did.",

There are plenty of food options in the area but if you want some great food and want to show your crew that you have mad yelping skills then you need to bring them here.   They take reservations or you can walk in and sit at the bar like we did. No Dodgers available in case you're interested.   Mauro at the bar was super awesome. Talk about 5 star service, that guy was the epitome of what great service is supposed to be. He knew everything about the menu and made some recommendations.   I had to go with the big sexy burger. OMG, it was cooked perfectly. Comes with fries. I didnt stop there. My friend and I had to order the pork belly. Best pork belly I have ever tried. It was cooked perfectly. Right between solid and melting. It literally melts on your tongue. You need to at least try it.   Overall, great place to stop if you're in DT Vegas near Fremont street. Give them a try. Happy eating/ drinking!",

I can't remember the name of the drink I had, but it was basically a bourbon-based blackberry mojito, and it went down easy. I should say *they* went down easy. And I put down a few bites of a delicious s'mores skillet too. There's so much good food in the Fremont East area. Like, really good. Break free from the tourists and casino fare!! So worth it.",

There was some type of party going on when we got there and the bar was packed, but we were still tended to in a timely manner & christina made me the best old fashioned I've had downtown.

    "text": "A necessary stop on any DTLV bar crawl.  Comfortable, contemporary eatery fitting of urban renewal that, while not as innovative as before, still dishes out solid, tasty grub.  Tip:  Share everything (but take a bite of the sandwich and put it back on the plate instead of cutting off a piece and I'll stab you with a fork).  The filet tartar topped with shaved parm ad a raw (uncured) egg yolk, as good as any (though not as good as when they used hangar steak).  Coarse beef, gentle seasoning that relies on the parm for salt and earthiness.  Mix, spread on the charred toast, add a bite of vinegary pickled veg to brighten it up.  No complaints.  Oxtail empanadas definitely work.  Tasty, gelatinous oxtail and a hint of fresh jalapeno chili flavor and heat in a puffed, crisp shell.  A dip in the earthy, zesty harissa lime sauce balances the flavors.    Equally satisfying, the charred Brussels sprouts.  Buttery, cashews for texture, mustard for zest, shaved parm for earthiness all serve to enhance the bitter sweetness of the sprouts.  Perfect cocktail / beer food.  The tender grilled octopus and zesty shrimp crevice (to be scooped up on blue corn tortilla chips) both good choices.  Limited but well chosen selection of craft beers and wines by the glass and bottle.  Well made craft cocktails (Downtown Manhattan baby).    Tip:  HH Mon - Thurs 14:00 - 17:00; reverse 21:00 - 23:00.  Good discounts and f&b pairings.  Very friendly, off Strip service.  Still solid but seriously, crispy pig ears, how I miss thee.",

Therapy was an easy choice when looking at all of my Yelping compadres reviews & pics.   Our meal started with the crab & artichoke dip. Honestly, one of my favorite app's I've ever had. I could have ordered this as the appetizer. Another order for the entree. And a third order as my dessert. Gadzooks was it good! Rich & creamy, the blue corn tortilla chips that came with it complimented the dip perfectly. Buyer beware, it comes out like molten lava, but once it cools down you can't shovel it in fast enough.  For our entree's we shared the mac & cheese and a cheeseburger. Both were very good. I'd probably try something different on my next go-round as neither blew me away. The mac & cheese was really good. We ordered just the small side order portion. Per our waiter, it's exactly the same as the entree (and less expensive). The kobe beef burger was good, but a burger, not too exciting. I'd probably get a little more exotic with my entree next time.  For dessert we rolled with the Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding. Definitely enough for 2-3 people to share. Being totally honest, I was so full by the time this came out that my flavor sensors were probably stretched to their limits. It was a good dessert, the house made banana sorbet was definitely the highlight. I'd order this again for sure, but would have to be mindful of how much I ate beforehand so I don't tap out after a few bites.  Great spot for lunch or dinner, casual dining. Awesome location downtown near all the action on Fremont. Will be back soon!",

We went on a Friday night around 7:30 and had reservations to get in which Is definitely recommended. We had a very nice waiter. I did not catch his name but he was everything you could ask for. He was very attentive and took care of our every need very promptly.   We all started with the Red Velvet Chicken and Waffle Sliders, The Chorizo empanadas, and the Creamy and Crabby served with Blue corn chips. Everything was definitely legit and very tasty. I don't recall what everyone had for their entree but I had the Ricky Ricardo. This is their version of a Cuban Sandwich. Not a traditional one by any means but still an extremely delicious sandwich which was served with some of the best plantains I've ever had. I did not get pictures of anything as we all just dug right in. There are plenty of pictures here on Yelp and a good video of the Chicken and Waffle sliders from when Therapy was featured on Travel Channel's Food Paradise.   If you are thinking of going I would definitely recommend. I am not a local but when I return to Vegas I will return for sure!",

The prices were very reasonable and the portions were decent as well. Had I known of Therapy we would have dined there every chance we got while being on Fremont.   Very nice environment, music was so pleasant. Bachata was playing. Our server was Jonathan. Since being in Vegas we had not received the service Jonathan gave us. He was very friendly and patient. I never felt rushed or uncomfortable. He was just the right attentiveness.   Over all mine and my husband's experience at Therapy was amazing! Great and delicious food is what we had and we will be coming back for sure next time we come back to Vegas!   Husband had firecracker shrimp tacos & truffle parmesan fries. I had the Senor Shorty and we shared an order of charred brussel sprouts. Everything was absolutely delicious! We also took dessert to go. We got the yummy crumbled carrot cake. Cutest tiny carrot as garnish.   Overall our experience was wonderful!",

Therapy is unique to all other bars downtown, largely because of its menu. The food is a step up from regular bar food and the drinks are often unusual and unique. I was the DD, so I didn't get to sample a lot this time. But I did have a blueberry upside down cake Therapy Shot. The Therapy Shots are switched out every so often. I believe this one was some sort of vodka-based concoction. Overall, therapy is a must-visit for tourists and locals alike!",

Their menu is a limited collection of elevated bar food made with higher-end ingredients like wagyu, truffle, and foie gras. Food was well executed and delicious.

Preparing good duck confit is not every cook's cup o tea. But the kitchen nailed it. The meat was tender and flavorful. Many people avoid duck because of it's gamey taste (I have no problem with it). I could not detect any gaminess. So try it and you will like it.  My dining companion ordered the Relapse 518 Lox. He was pleased with it. I got a bite and I gave it high marks.  I loved the ambiance. Open and airy with a lively vibe about it.  Long live these wonderful eateries off the strip. Go to the strip only if money is burning a hole in your pocket and you are yearning for poor service with an attitude.  Viva Las Vegas!!",

Stayed on the strip for a week and decided to come up to Fremont on my way out. Found this spot via yelp and now i know why the reviews are soo good!!  Ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles, the fried Mac and cheese, and the fried chicken sandwich.   EVERYTHING was divine!  The chicken and waffles were sooo good! Loved that it came in a sandwich style! Although the portion looks small, it was super filling! My boyfriend could barely finish, he was so full! The Mac and cheese-- OMG. Other worldly! Never had fried Mac and cheese that was so good! The sauce on it and under it was just amazing!!! Paired really well. My chicken sandwich was heavenly!! I love fried chicken, I've tried multiple restaurants and this was a definite winner. I loved how they didn't give a huge portion of French fries because it would have gone to waste so I really appreciated that actually!   Louis was my waiter and he was FABULOUS! Great customer service! Made us feel so welcomed and he was so so nice. Definitely makes me want to come back even more! Great service always goes a long way so I applaud y'all for that.  Left Vegas with a BANG! Can't wait to come back",

Stopped by for a Therapy session before heading back to reality (last day of vacation in Vegas) and it was the best decision I've made all week.   We sat outside with a great view of Fremont. We also were allowed to bring our pup with us. We had the nicest waiter ever, Louis, who was super friendly and quick. He was very efficient and attentive, he even offered my pup some water. I'm grateful he was our waiter and he deserves a promotion/raise!   We ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles, fried Mac and cheese croquettes, and the King! Literally everything was bomb! The fried chicken for both dishes were finger-licking good! The waffles were delectable, very fluffy and cooked well! The fried Mac and cheese was interesting, in a good way. Never had Mac and cheese like this but it was so good. The jam it comes with makes it even better. Presentation was awesome as well!   I definitely will come back here next time I'm in Vegas!",

Now old enough to be considered one of East Fremont's staple eateries, the lengthy build-out of a space formerly housing a Dollar Store still looking fresh and attracting crowds of tourists for both Food and Drink, it is under the direction of General Manager Maria Horta that day-to-day activities are coordinated, and thanks to the spaces' \"Relapse Nightclub\" those hours frequently extend well past midnight.     Offering lunch and dinner, plus recently weekend Brunch, it was at the tail-end of Happy Hour that business began to pick up, service friendly yet professional while offering their suggestions as well as thorough explanations of plates from recently promoted Executive Chef Chris Robyn.  Originally themed as a gastro-pub, but since taking on global influences spanning from Mexico to the Native American Cuisine Chris has been cooking for several years as a corporate Chef for one of the Nation's largest casino groups, it is rightfully with Cocktails that many nights at Therapy. begin, both a $12 Mango Ricky and frozen Pina Colada performing well and pairing nicely to the \"Signature Salad\" of Apples, Candied Nuts and mixed Greens plus Bleu Cheese.  Still maintaining several day one dishes, both Devils on Horseback and tender Chicken Meatballs highlighted by vibrant housemade Sauces, it was unfortunate that \"Birria\" Empanadas featuring Beef rather than Goat were strictly one note inside over-thick Pastry, though \"Fred & Mark's\" Croquettes offered three fun bites thanks to fried Pasta topped in smooth Sriracha with a sweet and savory reduction beneath.  Moving next to \"Creamy & Crabby,\" at $17 not cheap but entirely justified by its sharable size and plenty of freshly picked Meat, suffice it to say that time plus an appearance on \"The Travel Channel\" have seen Chicken & Waffle Sliders improve tremendously in terms of taste and texture, though if one is looking for Therapy.'s best dish that honor still belongs to \"In The Gnudi\" with creamy gobs of Ricotta made sticky with Figs.  Not about to forget Chef Robyn's years as Corporate Executive Chef for Bachi Burger, The \"Big Sexy\" featuring eight ounces of expertly-cooked Wagyu on a springy Bun with Brie and Scallion Mayonnaise, it is in strong competition with The Kitchen at Atomic that Therapy.'s Pork Chop finds itself for best in town, though the \"Mustard Mash\" can at times be a bit overpowering.  Onward to Dessert, and showing off Indian Fry Bread served as part of the recently-debuted \"Senor Shorty\" en route, Therapy. currently features two old and two new sweets, the Campfire S'mores in cast iron decidedly rich in comparison to deconstructed Carrot Cake that rivals any in Sin City, though the real showstopper is titled \"My 3 Best Friends\" and features Chocolate, Peanut Butter and Strawberry Belgian Waffles heaped with nine scoops of Brown Sugar Gelato plus a trio of Sauces, Nuts, Fruit and Whipped Cream.  FOUR STARS:  Somewhat forgotten with the abundance of recent openings in Las Vegas, Therapy. nonetheless continues to lure in guests with fair prices and food that doesn't take itself too seriously, the promotion of Chris Robyn to Executive Chef promising good things to come given his interest in both Hawaiian and Native American culture.",

The restaurant wasn't packed but there definitely was patrons. After being greeted we were led to our booth and given lunch menus.   We ordered the steak frites, wagyu hamburgers with bacon,  chicken fried chicken club, French dip, truffle fries as an upgrade, several sodas, and water with cucumber/ lemon.   Our server/hostess/ greeter/ busser- truly was a one lady show. She had to work the whole inside plus tend to the patrons sitting outside. So yes the food took a bit, but after watching that it was understandable. After awhile they finally had 2 other people come out to help her.   Each person at my table had their own ideas regarding the food. I know for the French dip, chicken fried chicken club, and one of the burgers was hit, plus those truffle fries stole the show.   Interior is modern with plenty of table and booth seating. Plus seating outdoors. The bar was well stocked, with some racing playing on the televisions. They have a house DJ - who was playing songs that brought back some good memories.  Pricing is reasonable as it is in a tourist area.   Location is Freemont/ Las Vegas Blvd-- parking is streets, garages, or lots.",

    "text": "We came in on a Tuesday afternoon around 4 PM. There was not very many people in the restaurant which was nice because I was hungry and I was not looking for a crowd. The atmosphere seems like it would be fun place in the evening and they had great music playing during the afternoon. Our server made great suggestions and we took him up on a couple of his ideas.  The gnudi Is a complete must! If you don't plan on ordering food get this anyway. If you do plan on ordering food you have to eat this. It is so rich and perfect for sharing! They are small portions but it is very rich so it satisfies your appetite.  The carne Asada tacos were not my favorite. I took one bite and that's all I could handle. There is some sort of sauce that tastes like pesto and I do not like pesto. In my opinion I would not order the tacos again.  The chicken and Red velvet waffles were good but they could have used more sauce. I wish I would have asked for more syrup because they were a bit dry but very tasteful.  The sliders were very tasty! The meat seemed like it was higher grade and it was very moist.  I definitely suggest stopping by this place either for a drink or for food",

Had a friend in town so we walked up at 730pm on a Friday and was promptly seated without needing a reservation.   Inside was bigger than I had expected and decor was modern and music was great!  Our server was great, very attentive, dressed very well and when I couldn't choose between drinks and a meal he suggested which was better and I was very pleased!  I ordered the Mango Ricky and it was perfect!  Dinner I had The Chick and it was UH-Maze-ing!! Legit the chicken was PERFECT!! It was not over cooked, it was juicy and crispy. The sweet potato mash was sweet and yummy (could have been warmer but it was very flavorful), the broccolini was also cooked perfectly but wasn't very warm but I love broccoli so it didn't bother me and the sweet chili mole was to die for!!! Love love loved that sweet chili mole that gets 5 stars for sure!!  The service was slow but we were not in a hurry to get anywhere.   I'll be back - there's other food items I want to try and definitely more drinks I want to try :-)",

    "text": "When planning a place to meet up for dinner with friends, one of my girlfriends suggested Therapy. I had never heard of it (I do tend to live under a rock though) so I immediately Yelped it and found that it had great reviews. Sweet, let's go!  Let me just say, I do not like going downtown usually. It's a pain to get to, the street directions can be confusing, there's always construction, heavy traffic and parking is a pain in the butt. Well (praise be) I got there super fast, did not get lost, and there was a parking lot (pay to park on 6th St just south of Fremont) just across the street a little ways. So it was super easy and not a pain at all! We were there this past Saturday evening, Michael was our server and he was wonderful. He had great suggestions and his favorite drink ended up being the best one we tried! Raspberry Rose, it's so good! We also had The Smash and Mango Ricky which were both really really good too.   For food we ordered: Devils on Horseback-AMAZING and def my fav! The Gnudi-this was really good but not something I personally would get again Creamy and Crabby-delicious, I love chips and dip and this was so creamy cheesy and crabby! Yum! The Big Sexy-pretty dang good tasty burger, I did have to squish it down quite a bit just to fit it in my mouth! To conclude, all four of us enjoyed all of our selections and vowed to come back and eventually try everything else on the menu!",

    "text": "After scrambling to find a place in downtown Las Vegas, I finally settled on Therapy, as it seemed to have the widest array of food options for my group of 4.   We were seated upstairs relatively quickly, but the area upstairs feels kinda cut off from the rest of the restaurant. The downstairs dining section is very open and bright while the upstairs felt kind of intimate and packed; the ambiance certainly felt different upstairs.   We ordered 4 items off the menu: Red Velvet Chicken and Waffles, Charred Brussel Sprouts, Chorizo Empanadas, and the Filet Tartare.  I would say that the best dish was the Brussel sprouts. They had a nice flavor but were a bit softer than advertised: the crunchiness of the cashews helped to make up for this. The red velvet waffles were certainly an eye-catcher and make for a cool photo, but taste-wise, these chicken and waffles felt like a very standard interpretation of the dish. Somewhat difficult to eat I will admit, as gripping a waffle is very different than gripping a bun, but I like the creativity of using the waffle differently!  I wasn't a fan of the batard bread that the filet tartare came with, as it was somewhat tough to chew. The chorizo empanadas were average, nothing necessarily bad or great about them.   Our service was a little disappointing, as it took quite a while for our dishes to come out. Considering the size of the plates, I was surprised by the total amount of time it took to have them sent out from the kitchen.   I think there are definitely some solid plates to be had at Therapy, but my overall experience didn't match the expectations I had. I think it's a place worth giving a try though, as downtown Las Vegas needs some places that can match the excitement of the dining options on the strip.",

    "text": "It was my first time dining here, I went with my friends about a week ago after an event I went to at the Golden Nugget. I like the location of this place, great for downtown/freemont st. crowd.   We ordered the Fried mac and cheese, korean BBQ bao buns, Brussel sprotus, and Cast iron smores for dessert. I also had the Mango Ricky for my cocktail.  The mango ricky was good, I wished it was presented in a different glass, but that's just me being picky.  The fried mac & cheese is very different, but good! It was on a bed of tomato-bacon jam, which was a little too sweet for me, and there was a lot of it. Although it looked great as a presentation for the jam to be spread on the plate with the mac and cheese on top, I would have preferred the jam to be separated on small dish on the side. I also thought that the lump of sriracha aoli on top was too much, maybe a little less would be better, since the mac & cheese is already good and full of flavor.  The Brussel sprouts with bacon tasted very good, however, I would have liked it to be a little more crispier.   The cast iron Smores is probably my favorite dish of the night! The marshmallows were toasted perfectly, and was not burned, and the amount of graham and chocolate at the bottom was a perfect amount. Be careful touching the cast iron, because it comes out very hot!  5 start because the food was great and the service provided by our server, Michael(?), was excellent. He welcomed us, asked if we had questions, took our drink and food order on time, recommended items from the menu, answered our questions, and assisted with a friendly manner. Great service definitely makes a good restaurant!",

    "text": "So I am not sure what people are talking about when they are saying good value.  Does this mean that the portions are big, or the price vs. what you get is comparable to other DTLV?  Because that is not the case.    First of all let me say that I am not the type of guy to walk into a restaurant and base it off of how much food you can serve up onto a plate...this is ridiculous and the reason we have major health and obesity issues in our fair country...well along with a lot of other reasons but it is a strong contribution.  Therapy has come into the DTLV area and with the first restaurant under the owner's belts it falls short on a few things.    Let's focus on what they are doing right first, because I'm not here to bash, I'm here to help the readers make good decisions on their dinning experience and go to a place that is True to what you read.  The space is amazing.  Exposed beams that were stained walnut and were a discovery while demoing the room for the new restaurant, a brick south wall that ties in the exposed ducting and ventilation to make the place seem huge and open.  The place breathes and the 130 seats fit nicely within the walls.  Nothing is cramped, it was an impressive renovation and detail was attended to...nice job gents!  Chef Daniel Ontiveros who hails from Comme Ca as the Executive Chef in the Cosmopolitan has taken over the open window kitchen and has serious chops.  His menu has been sliced and diced though due to the size of the kitchen...which is the only thing in the restaurant that is small.  9 menu items have already seen the chopping block due to the sheer need for more space and prep.  On the DL he had more to his menu in the beginning and that was put by the wayside for a more \"American Tapas\" style.  What the Hell does that even mean...\"American Tapas\"?  They are more of a shared small plate style and do have a few larger entrees that look like they might fit into a more traditional meal style establishment.  The Bartender was super friendly and tried to guide me in the best way she could through the menu, although she really didn't have a good knowledge base of the beers they had and had no idea where to find them in the cooler....I actually had to point them out to her.  Not a big deal, but if you are new, and you have put all this money into a new venture, let's start paying attention to detail folks and train your staff.  The food...well it was good, nothing to write home about but tasty enough. But do you go to a restaurant to have just OK food?  I mean I like to walk away and be like, \"I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!\"  which is how I felt about Carson's Kitchen and the newly changed menu at RCP, all in the same area.  The dishes were also a bit overpriced for Downtown. The asparagus, country ham and shaved Parmesan with a poached egg is what really tweaked my britches though.  I never send stuff back, mostly because I have worked in the food industry and there are some shady buggers in the back that get peeved and do not so nice stuff to the food...maybe not in these types of places but enough to make me worry just a bit..ever seen \"Waiter\"...yea.  The soft poached egg came out, the first time, hard and not a bit of yolk to spill out over all the yummy goodness that I was expecting after the the GM prepared me for what was to come.  So, I sent it back and received a new one.....DAMMMMIIITTTTT!!!  It was the same bloody thing.  Ugh!!!! I asked the GM if they suveed their eggs or cooked them to order and he told me that they did them to order, and then proceeded to tell me that this was the way it should be even after telling me that it should run over the asparagus and soak into the dish like a pretty little yolk blanket (my words not his).  So I ate it and...well meh.  The Oxtail empanadas were pretty good though, the oxtail meat is braised apparently for 12 hours and the empanada dough is home made by the pastry chef in back who also does their bread in house. Chef Daniel came out to apologize for the mistakes and that made most of it all better for me, I love when a Chef has the newtons to come out and take the beating for what is being created in the back..good for you Chef.    So, I will probably go back just to try it out and see if it all was just growing pains and I will bring a bigger wallet and maybe a rich friend to pay for it all.  The last thing is, Owners, please don't lurk, I know this is your first venture but creepy is not a good way to keep people coming back.  Thanks Chef Daniel I know you have the chops to make this place better, please, please don't let the menu fall into the Bar and frozen drink category of Freemont street, seriously guys...frozen drinks on your cocktail list...wow.",

    "text": "Therapy is located in between RCP Pizza and The Beat coffee shop. Therapy moved into  the same location as the dollar store. I remember the Dollar Store, so when I walked into Therapy last night I was very impressed with the look and feel of the place. Therapy has a very natural, modern look with a lot of natural light coming in. The ceilings are arched and raised and the flooring is a beautiful tile that looks like wood. One of the servers advised that the ceiling was there since the 50's as well as the block brick wall. I was shocked, the dollar store covered the beauty with dry wall. I went last night for dinner with a group of 9 people. We made reservations in advance. When our group arrived we were given a friendly greeting by the staff and shown to our table in the back by the kitchen. At first we were apprehensive about sitting so close to the kitchen. One of the servers advised that we would not even know they were there, they were right. Our friendly, pretty server explained the menu and asked if we wanted to bring out the food as its ready or eat at the same time. We were hungry so we agreed to get the food as it was ready. I ordered the Chicken meatballs and the Corn, it was very good. I also tasted the carrot cake crumble dessert which was also amazing. Our server also went above and beyond in splitting our bill at the end of dinner, we were happy that she was able accommodate us. A lot of restaurants refuse to split checks for groups so we were very pleased. I also tasted other entrees that other people ordered. It was very good. We will return!",

The wait staff is always friendly and attentive and it's always a pleasure going back when I'm in the area. They have live music on Tues and Thurs and it's a nice getaway from the Fremont crowds without going too far. I usually sit at the bar and Kandice always treats her customers like it's her own establishment - nice find management!  Look forward to going back!",

The owner, Roger, was so wonderful to work with! He created an amazing pre-set meal to all of our dietary needs and gave us a very fair rate for two hours of open bar. We had the entire loft to ourselves, which even had it's own restroom, so we felt like we owned the restaurant! The service was wonderful! Even with open bar, the server was always filling our drinks and making sure we were doing okay. The food... the food was outstanding! Literally some of the best food most of us had ever had! I was worried because they serve everything family style, which can mean some get more than others..... that was not the case! We could not keep up with the amount of food they were serving us! Every one had more than enough food and ate far more than we should have!!! I would easily return here with another party, and most definitely come for night out. An absolutely great venue!",

Next, this place itself is a fish out of water for the downtown area as it charges strip prices for upscale menu items.   I understand the desire to reinvigorate downtown but know your audience.  Sandwiching this place between the vanguard lounge and a local coffee shop is not going to generate customers.  The atmosphere is actually quite barren, part of the disheartening trend to push customers through without comfortable dining.  The menu is sparse but with interesting options.    We tried the chicken meatballs, devils on horeseback and the shrimp scampi.  The chicken meatballs were ok but nothing to write home about.  The devils on horseback were very disappointing.  The shrimp was good but be warned, it is a small plate and comes just with shrimp and toast.  The toast is forgettable.  We did enjoy the cast iron smores with bacon which was the star of the night.  There are far better choices around town.",

    "text": "Therapy. Yes, I needed it because the past few weeks has been taking its toll on me.  Husband and I got some hours in to do what lovers do.   So of course that meant...beer hopping! Isn't that what lovers do--beer hop? Lol. Well, whatever...that's what we did that night. What a great place to kick off our evening--therapy.   We entered, immediately greeted then seated, and seated on the 2nd floor because yes...it has an upstairs seating overlooking all of you down there. If your legs are aching from a leg workout, watching you walk up the stairs to get to the 2nd floor would be so entertaining.   I loved the decor of this place. The flooring, the seating color, etc...just my type of spot.  Long story short...since we were planning on hopping around, alls we ordered was the \"In the gnudi\" and a 20oz Stella. It is a baked ricotta shaped into the size of an eyeball (or what I believe to be) served on top of a crostini with fig jam and honey dropped atop And holy gnudi did it leave me in the gnudi for a gnudi. Btw, gnudi...pronounced like nudey.   Apparently, it's an award winning appetizer per the waitress. Not surprising because it was fantastic! The waitress informed us most their menu is meant to be shareable...13 bucks and 6pcs of these little guys, I say one man for themself. Don't share! Lol.   If you ever make it in, I highly recommend the gnudi if you are a crostini type of folk or ricotta is your shiz. We were trying to catch their happy hour, but it ended at 5 and it's at the bar only. So NOTE that homeboy/girl.  Highly recommend. I honestly wouldn't bring my children in here because the menu and pricing isn't kid friendly. If the first floor is busy and you are seated upstairs with a stroller, infant carseat, etc... bah humbug.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Therapy is a cool, fun, trendy, hipster restaurant located downtown Las Vegas on Fremont Street. I have been there a few times and I must say that the food and atmosphere are both good. Ok let's begin. A few of the things I like to start with are the SPICY CHORIZO EMPANADAS which has Spicy Chorizo Sausage, Red Peppers, Green Peppers And Spanish Onions Served With Harrisa Lime Sauce. It is very good although it's easy for me to like this considering that I love chorizo. Another item I like to order from the Bites section of the menu is the IN THE \"GNUDI\" which is made with Baked Ricotta, Truffle Fig Jam, Roasted Almonds, Cranberry & Walnut Crostini. Next is DEVILS ON HORSEBACK with Soft Truffled Goat Cheese And Almond Stuffed Dates Wrapped In Bacon On Romesco Sauce! Absolutely delicious. Now for the one and only The CHICKEN & RED VELVET WAFFLE SLIDER that is made with a Red Velvet Waffle, Buttermilk Battered Fried Chicken Breast, Red Pepper Remoulade Slaw With Vanilla Maple Syrup it's amazing if you are a lover of chicken and waffles it's my personal favorite. The  Fried Mac And Cheese CROQUETTES with Deep Fried Cheddar Mac Croquettes Served With Bacon Tomato Jam And Sriracha Aioli is also very good. The Charred Brussel Sprouts Tossed With Roasted Cashews, Butter, Whole Grain Mustard And Parmesan Cheese is decent and something I order from time to time. The SUPER MAC Orecchiette Pasta With Therapy's Signature Cheese Blend Bacon, Chicken and Steak is also good. Honestly there are so many things on the menu I'm sure you'll find something that you like. The only reason they don't get the fifth star for me is because of how early they close. Once again this is Las Vegas closing at midnight is a mistake. I personally think they should be open until at least 2AM especially on Friday and Saturday. Ok gotta go",

I would have preferred it either pre mixed or in a bigger plate so I can really make sure the parmesan and egg blend into the tartare and distribute the flavors properly.   The duck was much touted. I actually liked the sauce and root vegetables quite a bit more than the meat. They recommended medium on the duck, but I'm glad I got medium rare. The duck was somewhat tough, and medium would have made it too dry to eat. When combined with the sauce it was a pretty good dish.    The desserts are huge. For sharing only,  I'd say. I got the banana bread pudding. There were some good flavors there.   The best thing I had there was the old fashioned. That drink was amazing. Kudos to the bartender. So good!  Overall, it is a decent place to eat. Your average gastropub to kick off a night of fun.",

The whole place was so upbeat and welcoming that we spent far longer than intended and whiled away 3 hours and a couple of bottles of wine. If we didn't live several thousand miles away this place would be our regular! Cheaper than actual therapy but we left feeling great :-)",

I recommend Therapy for a great change of pace from the typical Las Vegas fare.",

Went in on a Tuesday with my husband after work for a nightcap and some dinner and was pleasantly surprised!  Our bartender Shannon offered great suggestions for dinner and was very knowledgable about the beer options. we tried several items and liked the sexy burger the best! We also tried oxtail empanadas that were delicious.  I had two cocktails that were very tasty and hubby was happy with his beers. We will be back!",

We were seated upstairs with a table overlooking the restaurant.  We ordered Oxtail Empanadas, Devils on Horseback, Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles Sliders and Super Mac.  Food was slow to come out.  We were busy catching up so it wasn't an issue but if you have somewhere to be, beware.  The food when it came out was excellent.  Empanadas were my favorite followed by the Mac n Cheese.  The only issue I had was the waffles on the sliders were so hard and crispy.  Cut your mouth Cap'n Crunch crispy.  All other aspects of the sliders were delicious.  I loved my drink Fuhgettaboudet.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Therapy makes me want to go Downtown more often.",

We heard good things according to one of our friends Uber driver so we were excited that they were able to seat us right away. There was live music which added a nice touch in a city like Vegas. The menu offered a variety of food and everything was kind of small for how it looked on Yelp pictures. We asked the server to describe some of the dishes and she made it seem kind of small too. Rest assured, the dishes are of normal size! They are on the pricey side though but I think everything in Vegas is pricey.  I ended up ordering the Super Mac just because and I couldn't even finish it. I don't know if I would come back here because the restaurant seems to not offer anything special. Just a variety of food ranging from KBBQ pork belly to Spanish empanadas. I'm not a big fan when it comes to places like this because to me everything is just mediocre because it's not specialized. I wouldn't come here and recommend this place to other people just because it doesn't scream Vegas. But if you're into chill places, then by all means. Our server was extremely understanding and was super nice so if you're visiting, shout out to Chantel (I think I butchered the spelling of her name).",

We walked into the two-storied trendy restaurant and saw that our party was sat next to the open kitchen. I thought it was cool at first...until I realized it was a sore spot for outgoing orders. This meant waiters bumping into the back of my chair multiple times, trying to grab their food. One waiter even dropped his plates which splattered everywhere. Our group yelled out, \"Opa!\" and applauded to distract him from embarrassment. See, I did not let this discourage me!   It was more-so the food that disappointed me. It took sooo long for our food to arrive, aaand they all came out at different times. Some of us had already finished their meal while others had just started. After awkwardly staring at my friends enjoy their food for a quite some time, my dish finally came out (LAST) and it wasn't even hot anymore. Like it seemed like it had been laying out for a while.  Despite the wait, my friends seemed to enjoy their orders - red velvet chicken waffles, chimichurri steak, big sexy burger, and oxtail appetizer.",

The atmosphere, however, was extremely loud. The servers were always available and friendly! They did a great job. The food was overly heavy and at times a little greasy. Our cast iron s'mores were way to sweet. We had about two bites and that's all we could take. For a downtown spot this seemed a bit more touristy than we like for a date night. We were hoping it was going to be a bit more like Carson & 7th or Carson's Kitchen, but in the end it was not. Not a bad spot by any means but not great either.",

Not the end of the world, however the restaurant was empty besides two people at the bar and one table that came in later.  A large party had cleared out right before we got there but this really shouldn't have had an impact on service.    We spent the majority of our time waiting for Mauro the server to attempt to actually do his job, I don't know, check in on the drinks, maybe stop by before we were finished with two different appetizers....Never happened.  We had to flag down the poor busser for, water, to order food, to go boxes, the check. Probably the worst service we've ever had, we even tried to remember one time, one place that had worse service than this place.  The food wasn't so good that you'd dream about one particular thing they had on the menu or stop by with friends. Ever.  We had oxtail empanadas and the mac and cheese croquettes.  The first was just okay, nothing exceptional, the second was covered with spicy mayonaise, or aioli if you want the fancy name for mayonaise with something added to it.  It also came with a \"tomatoe jam\" which was more sloppy marinara sauce with too much sugar and a little bacon thrown in there for no apparant reason.  The fried chicken sandwich was dry and cold (it was acutally siting in the window for about ten minutes before it came to the table) with \"The Ricky\" a pathetic attempt on a cubano sandwich.  It was basically a soggy mess of over braised pork on ciabatta.  Miami and cuban culture would burn the place down.   Don't do it people, save your dollars for another fabulous spot downtown.",

I ordered the short ribs, which had great flavor but were overcooked- not terribly, but enough to remind me of at-home pot roast.  The food took forever to come out, which was strange because, well, no one else was there.  The waitress was pleasant, but not the most attentive ever.  The restaurant itself is nice enough for brunch or a casual dinner.",

The hostess lead us to a small table stuck in a dark corner underneath a stairwell facing a waiters' station. We asked to be seated elsewhere. We were then shown to a table by the propped open front door. Mind you this is in January, so I again asked to be seated elsewhere. The snotty manager or whoever he was then asked me where I would like to be seated. I indicated a table. He said no, that table was reserved. We left.",

The menu is simple, approachable and fresh and the space is very inviting. No places on fremont have TVs at the bar so I'm sure it will be more popular once football season hits. My friend and I sat at the bar and had a great talk with Shannon. She was genuine, honest, quick, and overall just awesome. Had a peach martini which was not too sweet, just perfect and went down smooth. Started with the cauliflower and street corn which was delicious, and had the Scottish salmon as an entree.I've never had salmon cooked with the skin crispy before and it was incredible. Loved the vibe, service, cocktails, and food-very happy to see it in the neighborhood and hope it thrives!",

    "text": "Well, I REALLY had high expectations here.  The reviews made this place seem like I would be missing out big time if I didn't go.  The decor is very cool and enjoyed by my entire party, but the food was all together different.  I had the portabello mushroom burger and a charred kale side salad.  Salad had no flavor and just tasted like burned food.  Also got the charred brussel sprouts because I LOVE brussel sprouts.  While the ingredients were solid recipe choices, everything lacked flavor.  Definitely needed more seasoning to pop the flavors.  I tried to help the flavor by adding salt, but their salt shakers did not really work.  A grain would pop out after about 5 shakes!  I asked for a side of their red pepper aioli sauce which worked really well with the brussel sprouts.  My husband had the Ricky Ricardo and was disappointed.  There was an ingredient that just didn't quite go and through the taste off completely.  He thinks it was the grain mustard.  Kids seemed \"OK\" with their meals.  Best part of the lunch goes to the Mac n Cheese croquettes.  Hit the nail on the head with those!",

    "text": "I'm seriously wondering about the authenticity of the reviews for this place. I have never been anywhere that couldn't at least get one thing right. We came here on a Friday night for my Birthday with a small group of friends.  Arrived at 7:30pm and were seated promptly.  The place wasn't packed and the atmosphere seemed nice. Our waitress was sweet and took our drink order right away. My boyfriend ordered the Sangria, I ordered a Vodka soda with muddled fruit, one friend ordered a Pina Colada (again off the menu) and the other was a \"specialty cocktail\" off the menu. ALL OF THEM were horrible. The Pina Colada tasted like chocolate ice??!! seriously?? my Vodka soda came with a skewer of bar fruit on top of the glass. The specialty cocktail tasted like flowers and the Sangria was the worst I ever tasted. Ok, so the food must be good...right? We waited an hour after ordering before we flagged down the waitress and asked where our food was.  We received it 15 minutes later.  Literally the burger that was ordered looked seared on the outside and completely raw on the inside. The meat wasn't even slightly cooked.  My Chimichurri steak was slightly cooked but tasted like meat with lime juice. We had a chicken dish off the menu and it wasn't cooked thoroughly either. What a disappointment. We asked for the manager and waited again. I felt so bad for our waitress, as this was not her fault and she seemed horrified. When the manager showed up at our table, she apologized for the food and said \"I've been working in this business for 10 years and sometimes there are off days!\" Really!? Ok, off days maybe...but at least get a decent bartender that can make a Pina Colada right. You might as well make your clients good drinks so MAYBE the food will look and taste better. After it all, we waited 2 1/2 hours and had bad drinks and no food. I tipped the waitress $20 because none of this had to do with her, and we left to go have a burger at the place across the street. What a terrible start to my Birthday weekend, thanks to Therapy.  I would NEVER recommend this place to any one of my friends.",

The drinks were wonderful, and we ordered enough food to try everything (and left pretty full). I particularly loved the Smash (bourbon, blackberries, lime, mint). Simple, balanced, boozy but balanced.   We ordered an In the Gnudi (baked ricotta and accouterments) as a side with all our other bites, but it was perfect for dessert, and would be the one thing I'd be sure to get if I came back. The korean bbq bao and the fried mac n cheese weren't groundbreaking, but those are classics for a reason. Always hella satisfying.",

    "text": "Cool lounge with some quality food, nice spot for something new on Fremont. It was too early in the day to drink, so I popped in for some apps: the Social Club portion of the menu is tapas-style but the portion sizes don't really lend themselves to much in the way of sharing.  OXTAIL EMPANADAS: Delightful outer shell, great flavor on the actual oxtail, but it was a bit on the dry side. Those corner bites where the grease and juices collected were pretty great, though. This was served with a harissa-lime creme fraiche dipping sauce that had more color than flavor and did not add anything to the flavors of the dish itself.  HANGAR STEAK TARTARE: A passable classic version, but not one of the better ones in town. Good selection of pickled veggies, four crisp slices of grilled bread, and a reasonable portion, but not something I'd necessarily get again.  Even with just the two dishes I tried, the menu shows some promise. I'll have to come back with a few friends to try more, particularly the In the Gnudi, as my dining partner this visit is unable to eat ricotta. Service was friendly and attentive without being pushy, bartender was happy to suggest a few of her favorite dishes.",

    "text": "Came here with 3 friends on a Saturday night around 10 PM and we were seated right away. Hostess was sweet and service from Umberto (?) was great! Lighting was dim and later on I wasn't sure if my eyes adjusted to the lack of light or they made it brighter... Anyway, really cute metal pieces of art and lovely chandeliers along with a clean bathroom. There is a long bar that's all along one side of the wall with 3 TVs I believe. There's also a few tables upstairs and some comfy looking booths on the first floor.  Our server suggested that we share about 3 tapas per person but we each wanted our own entrees and decided to order the Mac and cheese with lobster and the Brussel sprouts. My friend and I split the French dip and a chimichurri steak. We were told that the steak usually comes out medium, which is how we prefer our steaks anyway. The two guys in our group ordered another chimichurri steak and a portobello mushroom burger.  2/5 My French dip ($16) came with truffle chips. The chips were a bit oily and had a very subtle truffle taste. I enjoyed the chips but could only eat a handful before I got tired of them. The French dip sandwich itself was lacking cheese. While the meat was nice and soft, it was also missing pickles or something. It got boring very quickly.    1/5 we were recommended the chimichurri steak ($25) and we all agreed that it was SUPER chewy. The steak I shared was also done medium well, while my friends' steak was done medium. The chimichurri sauce was ok, but The entire table was very disappointed in the steak. I would recommend something else on their entree menu, but if you do order the steak, be sure to order a side salad!  My friend liked his portobello mushroom burger, and he said it was good how it was.   2/5 ma and cheese with lobster ($19). What I liked was that there were actually lobster chunks on top of the ma and cheese. The dish itself was creamy but needed a more cheesy flavor to it! I thought it was just me but again, the table agreed.   2/5 charred Brussel sprouts were semi charred and pretty soft IMO. It was missing a sauce but overall it was good.    Presentation wise, everything was beautiful. Our water cups were constantly refilled. The total for everything including a Stella ($7), a mango drink that tasted like a margarita ($12) and a chocolate stout ($11) was around $150 for 4 people. I loved the service but the food left me feeling disappointed.",

Most of us opted for the small plates. The Brussel sprouts (huge portion) and street corn (they took it off the cob for us) were my favorites. The flavors were robust and delicious. The corn had beautiful layers of flavor including lime. A colleague had the chicken and red velvet waffles. He raved over how good it was. Someone else had the tuna and someone else had the salmon. Both enjoyed. The mac and cheese croquettes were delicious and presented well. I chose the signature salad with grilled shrimp. It was tasty and had Diced apples, watermelon radish, Candied Walnuts And Bleu Cheese with a white balsamic dressing. It was beautiful and great portion. It is right in the heart of Old Vegas on Fremont street, so perfect place to make a night of it. My only real negative is the lack of a waiting space. There is one odd table near the front that could be adjusted to accommodate people walking in. We had to keep shifting back and forth as we waited on our table. Otherwise, great meal, ambiance and staff.",

The bartender (cannot remember his name) took very good care of us and had strong menu and cocktail knowledge. They have an amazing bourbon selection as well! We started out with the Brussels sprouts and ended up ordering another round because they were so good! The bacon wrapped dates were also amazing. They were stuffed with cream and almonds which added the perfect flavor profile! We will defiantly be back!",

    "text": "I'm excited about this new place! So far based on the two drinks I had, the service, and the environment, this place is getting 5 stars! Grabbed drinks here while waiting for a table at Le Thai, and our experience was delightful.   We sat at the bar and perused the cocktail menu. There were so many interesting, scrumptious sounding drinks to try, but I went with the Pina Colada, my favorite. This one had a particular appeal because it included banana liquor, which I thought would be a nice touch. My husband ordered the Smash. Both of the drinks were so unique and refreshing. Not super sweet and not super heavy. Very light, delicate flavors and very beautifully presented (see photos for presentation obviously).   The service was great. Our bartender was very friendly and willing to answer all questions about the menu and was just an all around cool person. He had a lot to share with us about the chef, the inspired food and drinks and just regular human conversations. As we were walking by the window of the restaurant a few hours later, he waved at us. The fact that he remembered us is huge for me. When I worked in the restaurant business it was rare that I could remember a person. But he did. It means a lot to be treated like new friends than just customers.   Pina Colada: I love this drink. I am always ordering Pinas and this one was very different from the Las Vegas poolside original. It was not super sweet and didn't feel like I was drinking a milkshake (which is a good thing in this case). The banana liquor added a different dimension to the drink and gave it an added tropical feeling. They finished it off with some shredded coconut on top, and i think there was some in the bottom of my drink as well, which was a nice surprise at the end. All in all, I really loved it.   The Smash: This one has all the things my husband loves \"smashed\" into one glass. The fresh blackberries muddled in the bottom of the glass with fresh mint leaves creates a refreshing, light, sweet combo. Its almost like an adult blackberry lemonade. It is one of the fan favorites so far. My husband loved it as well.   We didn't have a chance to try the food yet, but I took a glance at the menu and there are about a million things on there that I would LOVE to order. So I will be back and add to this review, for sure!",

We were seated right away and the decor is nice, so matching with the decent reviews I was super hopeful. We received water right away and my boyfriend asked about beers, but the waiter walked away before he could actually order.  We ordered the crab dip with blue corn chips and that was super tasty.  I ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp- this is the description: Fresh Parmesan, Creamy Black Pepper And Garlic Dressing, Served With Garlic Parmesan Toast Shrimp / Chicken  There was no Parmesan. The crostini were mediocre- it was literally a pile of romaine with garbage dressing. The shrimp was $7 more for a total of $17 for a shrimp Caesar and there were 3 SHRIMP! I have no problem paying for extras, but what is the point?!   My boyfriend got the filet mignon and he asked if he could get mushrooms- the waiter mumbled something about vegetables and when his dinner they brought him a big thing of brussel sprouts?   We waited forever for our check- etc.  2 middle aged gentlemen checked on the 20 year olds next to us, but neither bothered to check with us.   I literally don't understand this restaurant. I live in a small town and most local restaurants blow this place out of the water.",

The Ceviche is very tangy and could use a little bit of 'kick', the Tuna Cups are served In individual cups with Wasabi and the Meatballs were tasty (get the hot sauce on the side). The service was great. Staff was very attentive and checking is we needed anything and if everything was prepared to our satisfaction.

    "text": "Great service and atmosphere, decidedly mediocre food. Went here on a whim with a big group and we had a good variety of choices that we more or less picked from other Yelp reviewers. The most popular dish on the menu appeared to be the velvet red chicken and waffles while friends opted for the mac and cheese, the fried chicken subs and salads. The sandwich looked great and I was really excited to find that the waffle had absolutely no velvet flavor, or any flavor at all while the fried chicken was bone dry. You had to be very liberal with the maple syrup to power through the sandwich. My sandwich was also obviously on the short end as the slaw wasn't like anyone else's cabbage slaw, it was replaced by another leafy green for a half of it and really had no flavor.   My significant other had the fried chicken sub with truffle fries. The fries were done to perfect, but the same could not be said for the sandwich. It was just as dry as my waffle sandwich and the bland bread roll certainly didn't help.   Another friend had the mac croquette which was very delicious despite the density of each croquette. Although it had awesome flavors, it was marred by a very odd choice of sweet salsa garnish as opposed to what looked like marinara at first. The flavors didn't pair well with each other and the croquette would have benefited more from something that is more tangy than sweet.   The pricing is decent for what you get, and the serving size is definitely perfect. I'd recommend approaching this place as distinctly a gastropub.",

Side not try the mama knows best cocktail #delicious. The cicktalu menu is fun and tasty it's a hard choice when looking at the great choices. Now to the food.

Next we had the chicken and waffle sliders. Wow I must say a great take on chicken and waffels. We also ordered the chocolate banana bread pudding. This dessert was absolutely delicious normally banana pudding is heavy and thick this is light and fluffy so much flavor the caramelized bananas with the homemade gelato made this traditional dish a new age masterpiece.

I had the chorizo empanadas appetizer, sliced steak entree and the deconstructed carrot cake for dessert. I was really hoping to love this food but can only say I liked it at best. The empanada chorizo filling was delicious but the empanadas were overcooked and burnt on the ends. The slice steak was difficult to swallow requiring lots of chewing. Not a tender steak. The carrot cake was yummy. The restaurant was cool, the food was fine. I'm sure I would go back again but I won't be rushing to get there.",

We only ordered beer but their cocktails looked tasty! I would like to try one in the future.   They serve everything tapas style so you can order a few things to share for the table. They also serve some dishes that are considered larger and can be used as a meal instead of getting tapas. We decided to start off with bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese inside served with a red sauce. They were amazing! Dates and goat cheese are two of my favorite things so I knew I would love these. We then ordered a crab and artichoke dip. This was one of the daily specials and I was excited to be able to try it. It came with homemade blue tortilla chips but we also ordered truffled chips to go with it. I really enjoyed this dip. We then ordered the red velvet waffles with fried chicken. They were served as two sandwiches with coleslaw and a chipotle like sauce and syrup. These hit the spot! If you have never tried chicken and waffles this is the place to try it. You can't go wrong with red velvet waffles. We then ordered the sliced chimicurri steak. It came out sliced already which was really convenient. It was so tender and I enjoyed the sauce it came in. We were very full at this time but we had to have dessert because we saw other tables order it and it looked too good not to try. We decided to order the smore skillet. It was amazing! It had marshmallows with crumbled graham cracker and chocolate. A great way to end an awesome meal.  The service was great. They were friendly and helpful.  I must try downtown restaurant.",

Georgie recommended her favorite dishes and we tried many of them and were very pleased. Our favorites were the crab dip, chicken meatballs and chimichuri steak. Each dish was very unique and full of flavor.  The atmosphere in the main dining was exactly how I imagined it... Vibrant and full of activity.  My friends had recommended I try this hot spot, and I'm glad we decided to try a new restaurant out of Green Valley and off the Strip. Thank you, Jared and Thom, for a wonderful meal and experience.",

We were greeted by the hostess and were immediately seated. The server came by shortly thereafter and explained they were more of a tapas style American restaurant and explained the menu layout. She was very friendly and helpful, but feel she had too many tables to wait on and forgot us at times.   We placed our order for the wagyu burger and French dip sandwich (approx $20 each), both came with sides as well. We also ordered Brussel sprouts to start as well. The burger and Brussels came to the table and the server came by and apologized that she forgot to put in the French dip order to the kitchen, and she was putting it in now. We then waited about 20 minutes for the French dip. I understand mistakes happen, but there was really no resolution provided other than that they were sorry. We had a larger check, with a total of 4 beers, in addition to the other food items ordered.. I just would have expected something to have been discounted or taken off the check for the inconvenience.  Food was tasty, however service needed slight tweaks. Also, there was a wide range of menu prices. For example, the sandwiches were around $20each and then entrees ranged between $40-$50 in price. Would we come back? Maybe.. but only with tweaks to prices and to service as well.",

I ordered an impossible patty which is a branded beef substitute but it came out as a burger patty made of vegetables. They did take it off my ticket since I sent it back but i don't think it's fair that they put that on the menu like that. Also it was pretty slow service.  In response to the comment Therapy posted:  I understand you make your food fresh at your restaurant and I respect that. I just wish you were not misleading in the way you named it on your menu. I would not have posted a two star review had it said \"veggie burger\". I just want to set the record straight that the burger I ordered under \"impossible patty\" was in no way an impossible burger and I am upset that this restaurant portrayed it that way.",

    "text": "To be quite honest, I didn't know this was more of a restaurant until I visited for the first time last Friday. I had assumed it was just another bar in the Downtown area.  I met my cousin here for a few drinks before going out and we enjoyed ourselves.  The simple decor gives Therapy a cozy yet modern feel- Brick walls, high ceilings, charming light fixtures, and visible air ducts. I like it all. There is a decent sized bar where we sat, a separate section with restaurant-style seating, and more seating on the second floor that overlooks the space.   My go-to drink is always a rum and coke, but I wanted to try something different for once and ordered a Raspberry Rose from the Specialty Cocktails menu. Rum, fresh lime, fresh raspberries, and a rosemary garnish, I'd give this cocktail a solid 3 stars. It was tart as expected, quite refreshing, but where was the rum? A little disappointing, but still good.  I've never seen my cousin order anything but beer. He ordered a Heineken on tap and the bartender explained that they've been experiencing problems with the tap all day, so she offered him a bottle ($7) for the price of a draft. I thought that was really nice of her!  I'll have to come back and dine here to get the full Therapy experience. Updated review coming soon!",

    "text": "I have to say I am bummed about our experience. We arrived on a Sunday about 11am, the place was pretty empty- one table and a couple people at the bar. No hostess when we entered, we waited about 2 minutes for someone to come. She asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar for happy hour or at a table- we chose a table. There appeared to be only a bartender and our sever helping customers. She came and took our drink order. Brought our drinks a few minutes later and then took our meal order. Both times when she took our order she was practically walking away from the table before we were done. Weird, but whatever. So about 15 minutes goes by- she did not check on us nor was our food brought to us. My husband and I notice a particular person sitting at the bar working on a computer- both the bartender and our server are talking with her and looking at what she is working on. I see our food get put up for her to bring to us. She doesn't notice because she is busy with the woman at the bar- looking at whatever she is working on. Well now I am annoyed, so I timed it, our food sat in there waiting for us for 11 minutes. She finally see it and brings it over to us, only to let us know that she made a mistake and put two of the same sandwiches on the order- she asked us if we wanted the wrong sandwich or to wait for the correct one. We chose to wait- so here is the thing- the food was actually good. I had the Cuban and my husband had the Philly.  She did give us 10% off the bill for the mix up. As we were leaving we could see what the woman at the bar was working on- turns our it was the menus - so I assume she worked there at some level. So three employees spent more time working on their menu layout and chatting than helping customer (to be fair it looked like the bartender was helping his customers). So maybe on another day or another set of servers thing would have been fine, but we won't be back- even though the food was good.",

    "text": "The idea of going to downtown for any meal is a little extra for me because the parking is so complicated. Although, for those interested a friend use to have an El Cortez players card and was able to park in their garage for free. Anyways, apparently tonight's Friday night traffic, cold weather and far parking was looking a little too right.   Of course, I referred to Yelp and decided to try a new spot to catch up with a friend. It was pretty early evening and we were promptly seated upon entering.  They were serving happy hour with only a couple food items and drinks at the bar area but since I don't drink we were seated in the dining area. The food was decent and nothing on the menu was shouting pick me. I took a while to decide on something. We ended up going with the chicken meatballs to start with, pulled pork sliders and the big sexy. The chicken meatballs are a must!! They were mainly delicious because of the cilantro and jalapeno pesto sauce!!! The big sexy was 2.5 out of 5 due to the fact it had this gross extra creamy \"Brie and Scallion Mayo\". It almost tasted like goat cheese. In addition my friend rated the sliders a 3 out of 5. We ended our meal with dessert as well. We decided on the Cast Iron Smores and it lacked flavor. Maybe more chocolate could've added more flavor. I recommend ordering anything but that. The customer service was great, too. The servers checked on us often. Overall, for the cost I rather eat somewhere else. Downtown has many new and improved restaurants! Everything from the decor, seating, service, presentation of the food was great but the taste wasn't satisfying enough.",

I don't expect restaurants in the US to have good chimichurri but it was a valiant effort. Overall I enjoyed the experience. Nothing to really brag about but a great date-night spot. I felt it was a little over priced if I remember correctly.",

Debbie was so helpfull through it all. When we arived that day we were hoping people were going to like the food and the service was going to be decent.  In fact the service was GREAT!

    "text": "Two words: Never again.  We sat at the bar for brunch at 11:45 on Sunday. Not because there were no tables; there were only two parties seated at tables. As a bartender, I just prefer the bar. It's  a more relaxed environment all around, and usually, bartenders are more engaging. It's like you're a guest at their home.  Not at this place.  The first sign was when I asked a question about a particular drink. The response, \"You and I are going to have very different palates.\"  Ya think?  The tone would be off-putting coming from a server with a French accent at French Laundry on a Saturday night; much less a bartender on Fremont Street before noon. With two ballgames on the TVs behind her, yet.   I was a little disappointed at my 5oz wine pour -- but hey, I figured they're watching the bottom line, going by the book, so I had no right to complain... until I saw a solid 8 oz pour go to a person at the other end of the bar, and then 2 more to diners at a table, that the server picked up at the server's station. At that point I'd finished my glass, so I had no case to make.  Speaking of the server, he got a serious talking down to by said bartender not once but twice in front of us. He handled it quietly, mindful of the fact that we were sitting RIGHT THERE. If this was constructive criticism, it was disguised as pure condescension. And we should not have been privy to it at all.  There may have been a manager on duty. If so, he was purely on top of operations; never once came by to ask how we were doing. He did stop by the couple a few seats down from us, upon whom the chef (or someone from the kitchen) also spent a great deal of time chatting. Even the bartender seemed to enjoy their company, because we saw her smile while doting on them (note: it's great when friends come see you at work, but never good form to have two distinctly different personalities: one reserved for friends and one for everyone else).  Let's talk food. Kale salad was fantastic. It's hard to make kale tasty, and this was a solid execution, in terms of flavors, textures, and presentation. The chicken meatballs were okay. The jalapeno pesto made the dish. The mushroom flatbread... I knew that this was not the way to go when I saw the \"flatbread\" was in fact puff pastry. But the flavors sounded so good, we went for it. And the flavors were terrific. But a rich, soft topping of mushrooms, egg yolk, etc. needs the sturdiness and crispness of a proper flatbread to make the dish work - not a buttery, delicate puff pastry that gets weighed down by the toppings.  I've been to Eat, Carson Kitchen, and Park many times, for any combination of great food, solid service, and fun atmosphere. With all three nearby, there is no reason to return to Therapy.",

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.  Therapy is a very hip restaurant in downtown Las Vegas.  The crowd is definitely working class and the prices reflect that, with each tapa/meal costing around $12-15.  We came to Therapy to try a few dishes and settled on the mushroom burger and brussel sprouts.  The bad part was that it took about 45 minutes for the meal to arrive.  Considering it was 9:45 when we were dining, this rubbed me the wrong way.  Still, the mushroom burger was excellent and unique, while the brussel sprouts weren't anything to get excited about.  The drinks ranged from $6-10 for beer, wine started at $9, and cocktails around $12. Actually a very good beer selection, though prices were a bit high even for Fremont. Therapy is definitely a destination type of restaurant and not an every day Happy Hour joint.  I will be back because the food was good and the location unreal, but not the top of the top in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Meh....blah...basically a disappointment. I've been enjoying the new revival of downtown...E.A.T., Carson's kitchen, the Perch, etc. This restaurant delivers on the sleek and modern interior but falls considerably short on the rest. The food was ok. Out of the 3 shareable items we ordered the mushroom Flatbread was the tastiest. It's small and made with puff pastry but I liked the egg addition. The oxtail empenadas weren't bad but nothing I'd order again. They were small 2 bite empenadas. The mac and cheese was bland and void of flavor aside from the occasional bite of bacon. The sauce was more of a bechemel with very little cheese flavor at all. The waitress, although pleasant, was borderline car salesman-like. By that I mean, I felt pressured to order more food. She also blatantly interrupted our conversation to tell us more details about the items we had already ordered while we were waiting for them to be prepared. I also don't appreciate  being given only the option of 2 different bottled waters when I ask for water. I want tap water..yeah I know it's appalling, my apologies. The elder melon drink was another letdown. Priced at $12 and being given the sales pitch about how it's a sangria and made fresh daily on the premises, I guess I expected too much. The drink was small and tasted like a strong alcohol with a watermelon chunk in it. It resembled nothing of any sangria I've tasted before, no sweet fruity flavor. After we were done eating and were presented with our check...it took ages to get someone to take it. I ended up flagging down another waitress and asking her to take it, if I had cash I would've just left it on the table.  My final gripe is that there is no happy hour menu. We ate 3 appetizers and had 3 drinks...the bill was $77 and change. Sooooo not worth it. For half that price we could have gone to the Perch down the street or any other downtown restaurant with happy hour.",

And the food was overpriced and didn't even taste good. For the price I'm paying, it should at least taste a tad bit of good, especially considering that it's a tapa. Overrated by other yelpers... probably all part of the downtown community trying to help advertise this place. Would NOT recommend this place to eat.",

For my drink I asked I for it without the melon Iiquer but instead came out without the watermelon garnish. The food takes a pretty long time to get. After getting our food the next time we heard from our server was when we got the check. It's pretty unfortunate because this place seems to have a lot of potential.

We also got the Tuna dish which had way too much pepper on the seared parts of the tuna. Otherwise it was a good dish. Then we also had the oxtail empanadas and those were very good! My drink was called El Barrio and I wasn't feeling this drink. It didn't have much flavor outside of tequila and ice. I couldn't taste the lime or exotic fruit that is supposed to be in it.

After a long day of work and an early morning flight we were looking forward to some good wine and food. We were excited to find out that we had arrived just in time for Happy Hour! It is only available at the bar, but we were able to sit at our table and go up to the bar to order drinks. The bartender even brought our drinks over to us at the table after ordering. We all love to share plates so we ordered the empanadas, devils on horseback, ahi poke, roasted brussels sprouts, and crab dip. The empanadas were fabulous! Be sure to try the sauce that they come with. The devils on horseback were also delicious, as was the crab dip. To be honest the brussels sprouts were not memorable. The ahi poke was strange to me. It was mixed with watermelon, which I think served more as a filler than a flavor enhancer. I would not order it again. To top off the evening we ordered the s'mores for dessert. It comes with crumbled bacon on top. It was odd, but surprisingly good. It is a very rich dessert so unless you have a HUGE sweet tooth or are still very hungry I would recommend sharing it. I think we all agreed that next time we are in need of some therapy we know just the spot!",

The outer leaves were almost entirely blackened. The addition of the cashew nuts was interesting. This dish was brought down by the sprouts sitting in a bit of a bed of oil. For something as refreshing as Brussels Sprouts, it's disappointing to find them heavily greased.  Mac and Cheese: a little better than a standard mac and cheese -- the pasta was Orecchiette, which was cooked al dente and carried the cheese nicely. The cheese was good as well; not overwhelmingly flavored. However, this dish could have benefited from extra garnishing (spices, breadcrumbs, etc.).  Overall, I found this restaurant to serve decent food, though nothing outstanding by any means. However, it's probably among the best destinations on the Fremont strip.",

    "text": "Dining on Fremont East is finally worth writing home about.  Up until the arrival of Therapy, the 500 block was, in general, ailing with poor service and an even poorer menu selection.  Taking over what used to be a dump of a gift shop, the space is now a complete gut-remodel with clean lines encompassing two levels of industrial quality finishes that are subtle yet appealing to the eye in a way that does not try to detract from what really matters in the space: quality ingredients prepared properly and served with attentiveness.  Grub selected:   Soft Pretzel Bread - if you like soft pretzels as much as I do, one order won't be enough.   Oxtail Empanadas - light, fluffy and filled with the tail of an ox; really, these are a great appetizer.   The Perfect Cure - a very nice selection of cured meats, mustard and pickled vegetables; it is artery-clogging and healthy all at the same time.   Hangar Steak Tartar - large portion of chilled minced  beef with egg yolk and cheese on top. Comes in a nice mason jar type container to distract you from the fact that this is as close to puppie chow as you may be willing to get; fork optional, just how Fido eats works too.   Cast Iron S'mores - more of a baked dessert casserole than traditional s'mores but very nice nonetheless. I'm a traditionalist: s'mores should have milk chocolate not semi-sweet as these do.   Trio of Sorbet - the s'mores casserole didn't leave us feeling gluttonous enough so bring on the cherry, orange and key lime sorbet!  \"House-made\" and tasted delicious while being washed down with...  THE SMASH! - Four roses bourbon, blackberries, fresh mint & sweetened lime. Everyone on East Fremont is [trying] to make smashes; Therapy happens to know how to do it right.  Giving Carson Kitchen a run for their money...competition (and selection) is a good thing. May the best man win.",

    "text": "An excellent place for food and drinks while visiting Fremont Street. After walking through the Fremont Street Experience and past the Heart Attack Grill you will find Therapy on the left side of the street.  Hubby had the french dip and I ordered the portobello mushroom burger. You have a choice of a side and we opted for fries. The fries were crispy and made from real potatoes. I liked that the bun of my portobello burger was toasted to keep it from being soggy.  We ate at the bar and ordered a couple of their specialty cocktails. Drinks at the casino restaurants are $15 and up so I was thrilled that the drinks here were only $12! I can't remember the name of the drink but it was something that had peach jam in it. OMG it was GOOD!! Not too sweet, but a good balance of sweet and sour.  The service was friendly and the bartenders know their craft. It was fun talking to them and learning how different flavors are paired. This is not a cheezy, overpriced place with mediocre food and drinks. But, if you are looking for good hand-crafted food and drinks made with quality ingredients (and love), then Therapy is your place!",

The charred Brussels sprouts had a bit too much butter not as crunchy as I expected. Octopus was as good as you can expect for Las Vegas. It was tender and it had a good taste. Portion was a bit smaller than I expected. Didn't care for the Mexican street corn. Let's just leave it at that. The smash (drink)was very good. Good balance of taste and not overly sweet. Overall not a bad place. Prices are reasonable and better than the strip.",

Since I was on my lunch break I sat at the bar to get faster service (or so I thought) 10 minutes into sitting there before I was acknowledged. ughhh... did i mention i was on my lunch break?!   32 minutes into me arriving, I received my appetizer, the baked ricotta, which had a weird taste to it and was not very good at all. Then I waited for my meal.. a Caesar salad.. and I waited and waited... My food took 41 minutes to come out! I ordered a SALAD! a Caesar salad! The restaurant was empty, it basically echoed in there.   I let them know how much they sucked by tweeting them. They have a tv screen in their restaurant that if someone tweets them, it automatically shows the tweet up on the tv screen behind the bar. Well guess what??? no one edits or checks for negative tweets, so now you have a tv screen in your restaurant saying things like \"1 out of 10\" and how poor the food is. your operations manager must not be the brightest bulb...  and you better believe i contributed to that twitter screen.. i could see my complaints on the screen all over the restaurant, but the restaurant doesnt seem to care.  I will not be back. I will not bring people here and i will never recommend this place.",

Just craving some fun and different food for a reasonable price.  This place totally delivered. We originally intended to bring our entire bachelorette party here - but when a day club turned a bit too intense for most of the group, we came with three instead. The took us in with no problems and made us feel right at home!   Started with the empanada trio - super delicious. Loved the fillings - thought the outside could have tasted a bit fresher. Split a bottle of rose which we all loved. For dinner, had the red velvet waffles and fried chicken sliders. BOMB.COM. Five stars. For dessert, we had the dark chocolate souffle. Super good, felt like it could have been slightly better if it were warmer.  All in all, I'll definitely be back! On a fun street with lots of dining and drinking options.",

The fried chicken was moist and whatever sauce they put on it was great. My fiance got something and it came with these truffle chips. Oh. My. God. Amazing.

    "text": "I don't know if this place just didn't sit well with me or if I had an off night, but I was not having a great time here.   My first thought when I walked in was, \"this place was huge!\" Then I tried to scour my brain to think of what used to be there. We were seated immediately. The inside is very clean. Nice, modern touch to it. Everything is in top order. A plus.  Server was very nice. First beer I ordered was not available (it was a brown ale). The Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA was gross. Too flowery. The Fort Collins 10/20 pale ale was also gross. Not Therapy's fault, but this is just to set the stage of where my night was going.  We ordered the Oxtail Empanadas and the Steak Tar Tar. The Oxtail Empanadas are out of this world delicious. Oxtail is delicious and there is a generous amount inside that fluffy shell. The Creme Fraiche was a nice compliment for the empanada. Little sprigs of cilantro sit on top of the empanadas, great flavor as well.  Now the steak tar tar. There was not one thing I liked about this. The Steak Tar Tar comes with grilled bread and some pickled vegetables. I took a bite of the steak tar tar on top of the grilled bread and it was FUNKY. Just funky. Now I've had steak tar tar before, but not like this. I tried to pick out what I didn't like. I had a bite of the bread and it was legitimately gross. I asked the server what kind of bread and she wasn't quite sure what it was. I had a nibble of the steak tar tar and that was also funky. There must have been a spice in the tar tar, but I couldn't figure it out. Even the damn pickles were disgusting. One was fine and then the other...I just got a mouth full of black licorice. I was told it was probably (star anise?) the pickling agent. It was foul.  The good thing was that I was honest with the server that the steak tar tar was not good. I did say that it might just be me though. Server was nice enough to remove the steak tar tar off the bill (I didn't ask her too, it was very nice). I wasn't super hungry so I didn't get anything else, but was intrigued by STREET CORN.   Overall, I think this is a good date spot. It's clean and new. You can dress up or come in with shorts and a tank. It's versatile. Plus, the food servings are the best for really 2 people. I may give the place another shot. I will be downtown again and it's great to get a bite to eat. Just hope my next venture in I have better luck.  And some of that STREET CORN.",

My dining partner and I shared chicken meatballs,  Red Velvet Waffles and Chicken (commonly Chicken & Waffles) with a maple vanilla syrup and what I thought would be, heart stopping Mac and Cheese over a tomato bacon jam. Really good and not heavy. I was really suprised. Usually when a place is featured on a tv program, the food LOOKS GREAT, but is so rich that it's hard to finish. NOT the case at Therapy.. 5 Stars!",

We focused on sharing the small plates, and no one left hungry! The bacon wrapped dates were a stand out, but it was all great food. Wine list looked good, but the house-made sangria was delicious. The blackberry variety is sweeter, if that's your style, otherwise go with the other one; neither is a disappointment.",

Not only did she have a great attitude, she was thoughtful and fun to be waited by.    We would definitely go back and try other items.",

The atmosphere was also a lot of fun. We were there in the late afternoon, so were ordering from the lunch menu. It is not like me to order anything fried, but the red velvet waffle fried chicken sliders won me over with the salty sweet red velvet.  We also had the chicken meatballs which were moist and kind of spicy....and the deconstructed carrot cake, served with a tiny carrot on the side for effect. The sangria was amazing!  It was my favorite drink from the whole 3-day weekend in Vegas.  It had an almond vanilla flavor to it.  I drank 3 glasses.  Service was friendly and on-point.  My sangria and water were always filled. In the end, since I couldn't get enough, my husband bought me a cute pink Therapy T-shirt.",

We came in during their happy hour so there were drink specials and the bill was 20% off!   We had the charred Brussel sprouts, the empanada trio, the crab dip, and ended with the carrot cake.   I absolutely love charred Brussel sprouts and these were great with Parmesan on top.   The empanada trio consisted of their award-winning oxtail empanada, chorizo empanadas, and veggie empanadas. The oxtail was my fave but they were all yummy and full of flavor.   Crab dip was BOMB. Came out after the rest of our food even though we ordered it first. It was piping hot though so I knew the delay was due to it being cooked to perfection. Perfect blend of crab and artichoke.   Lastly the carrot cake was good, it was just way too sweet for me.   JOANNE WAS AMAZING AND WE WILL BE SURE TO COME BY AGAIN FOR HER AWESOME SERVICE.",

    "text": "I had a few amazing first's at this little down town, urban eatery. My First Tartar and believe it or not... My First time trying Charred Brussel Sprouts. I know... how have I never ordered Brussel Sprouts at a restaurant. Well I will from now on!   The Tartar was Filet Tartar. Topped with Egg Yolk Confit and Parmesan. Served with Pickles and Grilled Bread. This was so decadent, that even sharing, my husband and I did not finish it. It was very good, just too rich to keep going. The Pickles were a pleasant side pairing with the richness of the egg yoke. I would get this again but it might be a once in a year kind of thing for me. The Charred Brussel Sprouts were made with whole grain mustard and toped with Parmesan Cheese and Cashews. These little babies were a treat. Pop them in your moth and crunch down on pockets of awesomeness. These were gone in a matter of minutes, unlike the Tartar. Loved getting that extra crunch from the cashews.  We finished our night of exploring new things with something we were very familiar with. Carrot Cake. Crumbled Carrot Cake with brown butter ice cream and of course layered with cream cheese. Nothing special but very good. I tried to take the baby carrot that topped the cake out with us for the night but my husband wouldn't let me. It was just so damn cute!   Besides our meal we really enjoyed our 2 servers. I did not catch their names. Something I need to get better at. But it was a young man and woman that were personal and friendly. We very much enjoyed the atmosphere and set up of this place as well. Open layout with stairs that go up to what I think is a separate dinning area. Possibly for private parties I am assuming. And a very large high top bar area, where we sat. I can definitely see myself coming back next time I am in town.",

The mac & cheese balls were spicy and served with the most delicious jam I've ever tasted. The tomato jam tastes more like it's  a barbecue sauce and is the perfect accompaniment to the fried delicious bites.  The baked ricotta with cranberry bread is one of the best things I have ever tasted. It is light, creamy and warm. It is hearty without being heavy.

While the atmosphere inside is nice, the menu is a bit pretentious and unnecessarily expensive for the small portions served. If you're an uppity hipster, you'll love it.  Otherwise, pick somewhere else.  The two stars are shared for the servers and bus staff, who were the only light in this dimly lit place.",

The food menu is inspiration for conversation. Fried pig ears with truffle honey mustard are delicious. Full menu until 11 pm, then happy hour menu until 12:30. At the time we went, they had a sale on the back bar beers. 12 oz for $3 and $20 oz for $5. Awesome staff, good attitudes. Try this place out for something different in Vegas.",

We planned to have dinner and Therapy provided dinner at bar. Best part of eating at bar, drinks close and no children. We were quickly greeted by Christine and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered vodka rocks and she provided a gracious pour. Christine took our order we had a couple of salads and appetizer and shared a steak. I wasn't sure what to expect. I can tell you, it was an amazing dining surprise. Appetizer \"Devils on Horseback\" a real treat and loved them. Beet salad and Signature salad were both tasty treats. Filet mignon was gracious cut, and cooked to perfection. Service was exceptional and attentive to our needs. Jane our server, was available and focused on our progress and combined with Christine made an otherwise standard dining experience, \"exceptional\".  We typically pass on desert, but a Cast Iron S'mores on the menu was enticing. It was delightful and simply great and not to be overlooked. Christine and Jane satisfied our discerning tastes and provided great service. I am planning to revisit soon and will add to one of our nights of dining. Can't wait.",

The establishment was clean and well staffed. The service was excellent and the food, well what can I say, the food was really, really good. Not too over the top, not too mainstream but rather a new fresh look at basic favorites. The cocktail I ordered was well priced for top shelve and the bartender actually knew how to make drinks properly. Therapy does not try to be something it is not, its basically great tasting food in a very nicely decorated space with a management and staff interaction you would expect in higher level establishments. Understand your clientele and deliver good service and food. These guys (and gals) definitely know what the public wants and its refreshing to see for once, in Vegas a place that knows how to deliver!  Well done Therapy, can't wait till we return, and that will be often.  JWP - North Las Vegas",

I ordered a watermelon drink which was pretty good. It was about $12 or so for the drink. When I check my bank account, it says $50 at Therapy. At this point I was so angry. I called 4 times to talk to a manager and he said he would take care of it and NEVER did anything or called back. He had told me the bartender mixed up our bills. I understand, bars are busy, people make mistakes, but this was rude and left unaddressed and I apparently spent $50 to be annoyed and never wanna go back.",

It also came with heirloom tomatoes which I ordered on the side as I don't like tomatoes. They came in a little bowl and I tried them, but not being a tomato fan I cannot judge them appropriately... It also came with truffle fries which weren't overpowering with truffle like I feared. The food was outstanding. This was my second visit and I will be back again! The service was superb. The ice tea glass was constantly refilled/replaced without asking. Ordered the Cast iron smores with bacon which were also outstanding, though I would have liked a little larger serving for the price.  Highly recommend! The manager came by more than once to ensure all was ok, which I appreciate his attentive service. Serve was courteous and friendly. I have found the perfect wagwu beef burger!",

We also got the Super Mac (BEST Mac n cheese EVER with loads of Parmesan), Shrimp Scampi, Hunter Chicken, Chicken Meatballs with Jalapeno sauce, Short Ribs, Red Velvet and Chicken Sliders and for dessert, the Carrot Cake with Brown Butter ice cream and the Smores. The only reason I took off a star is because the carrot cake wasn't warm - it would e been perfect if it were served warm. I definitely need to go back to Therapy just to try their Charred Kale Salad - not ordering it was my biggest regret of the evening.",

After perusing the extensive cocktail menu we picked our poison and proceeded to be enticed to grab a bite.  I'm glad we did! I ordered Summer Squash Flatbread and Hubs got the Big Sexy Burger. OMG... So good!  Mine was very good, but the burger looked and tasted amazing. There are so many other items I want to try that going back isn't even a choice... It's a must!

    "text": "Order those smores. Do not pass them up. we were pretty stuffed with all the stuff we ordered, but one of the servers really pushed to have us order it... I'm glad we didn't pass.  Other must tries are the macaroni and cheese - it has pork belly / bacon in it. 5/5.  The bacon wrapped dates - 5/5. I wish it came with more though.  The red velvet chicken sliders - 4/5 . They give you two. I couldn't distinguish the red velvet waffle from the taste of a regular waffle. The bourbon maple syrup that came with is was amazing though - it tasted like it had a bit of vanilla in it too - I could be wrong....  Fried gator from the tailgate menu - Decent. 2/5 .You can't really go wrong with frying things. Tasted like fried chicken that wasn't dry.   Filet Frites - Ordered medium rare . 3/5 well cooked. I just didn't taste the truffle oil on the fries. Least favorite but most expensive.   Vibe - semi pretentious but bearable as you get a mixed crowd with it being located on Freemont street in downtown Vegas.  Service - excellent. Servers had much to say about each dish and even made recommendations. I think the manager or someone that ran the place even came out to talk to us about the food",

I was in Therapy over the weekend with my gf and a buddy I had in town traveling to see us from Australia. We thought Vegas would be a fun mini trip to show him a good time.. (were from California). So we hit downtown and stumbled into Therapy on a whim. We were stoked with the venue as soon as we walked in. Super sick looking with a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. We decided to sit at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender, Kristina. She was great and made us laugh the entire time. Totally funny. The food and drinks were great too. She recommended \"The Shorty\" to my buddy and he didn't stop talking about it all night. We had such a good time, we were basically the last ones out the door when they closed. We will most definitely go back next time we're in Vegas!",

We ordered several items, one at a time, with the intention of going \"tapas style.\" We started with the empanada trio and it was a hit with our group. Our favorite was the chorizo empanadas. Next, we ordered the buttermilk chicken breast on a red velvet waffle. That was very difficult to share. I really wanted to eat the entire thing myself, especially because the cole slaw topping was one of the best I've ever had. Next, came the \"Big Sexy\" burger. We ordered it medium well and it was perfectly cooked. The aioli gave it such a creamy texture that we all finished up licking our fingers. This was truly a memorable dining experience in a city full of mediocre buffets and overpriced Food Network chef restaurants. Please do yourself a favor and check out Therapy!",

We were met at the host stand by a hostess who may have been on her first day advising us of a 15-20min wait. We were added to the list and told we would be called once our table was ready. That didn't happen. 35-40mins passed and once we checked in at the host stand for status we were told we were deleted from our reservation. Here's how Therapy handled it...the manager (tall thin accommodating woman) bought us a round of drinks and personally served our meal. What great retention service. If I'm Vegas I'll come back for the service, the smash (cocktail) and the delicious food we shared. Oxtail empanadas were amazing as was the crab dip mmmm  Downtown Las Vegas is becoming gentrified!",

We made last minute reservations and were sat at great table with nice comfy seats. The service was polite and attentive. And while lively, the music wasn't so loud that we didn't have to shout at each other to have a conversation (I know...if the music is too loud, then you are too old..haha).   We ordered three dishes to share: Therapy's Signature Salad (a yummy salad with greens, watermelon radish, granny smith apples, candied walnuts with blue cheese), Sliced Chimichurri Steak (melt in your mouth tender and perfectly seasoned) and the Super Mac (a mac and cheese - of the three this was so-so, a bit bland, but we needed the carbs after a crazy Saturday night). I paired it with a glass of wine and was impressed with the generous pour (god bless America!).   Lovely meal. Thanks Therapy! We'll be back.",

We all loved the epinadads for the app, and wished we woulda just ordered a big plate of those. I had the pork belly which was well made but nothing set it apart from any other pork belly I've had. I generally like it when it's thicker cut. A few people ordered a pasta dish (sorry don't remember what it was but looked like a bacon carbonara) and they all loved it. There was also a Philly cheesesteak ordered and that was under whelming.   Server and hostess were both great and we had good service the whole night.   I'd recommend trying this place if you're down in Fremont. This is the first time that I've eaten down there so not much to compare it to unfortunately to recommend it above any other place.",

When the food came out, it was like opening day...many of us where here when this restaurant first opened, and I liked that the food hasn't really changed, it was just as good as when we first tried it the first time.  I'm happy that this place is still providing the same good food and service and kept it consistent.  If your ever in downtown Fremont, check this place with your friends or family!  :)",

We got our beer but after waiting for an hour we still hadn't received our food. So when the server came back asking if we were ok, I finally asked about our food, he said it was coming up. The restaurant had two tables downstairs and some upstairs but definitely not busy enough for the food to take that long. When we realized that he had even put in the wrong order we decided to leave they hadn't even set our table up with utensils so I guess they really had no intention of feeding us. Will never come back it's to overpriced too.",

The entire restaurant had been reserved for the night, so call ahead to reserve your table.   Big shout out to our awesome server Humberto! He was super attentive, great with dish recommendations and was so friendly. Highly suggest you ask for him when dining there.   ROAST DUCK ($26):  Crispy-skinned duck breast was perfectly cooked (the best fat rendered duck skin I've ever had!). It was served atop a bed of pureed butternut squash and roasted root veggies. I could've done without the roasted root veggies though because it was too briny.  The sweet huckleberry reduction and pepita seed granola brittle was a nice touch.   THERAPY'S CRAB DIP ($16): Gluten-free dish that was pretty damn good. It wasn't lump crab meat as advertised but there was a lot of crab meat & tasty melted parmesan nonetheless. We didn't taste any artichokes in the dip though.  FRENCH DIP SANDWICH ($17): Really tender roasted prime beef with aged cheddah served on a nicely toasted hoagie roll. The fries were nicely seasoned and really crispy too. Absent was the advertised creamy horseradish. Still a tasty sammie overall.   KOREAN BBQ BAO ($15 for 3): My favorite dish of the night! Super tender slow-braised pork belly that just melts in your mouth.  The thin \"Korean BBQ sauce\" was sweet & savory and didn't overpower the precious pork belly at all. The ripe kimchi and pickled julienned carrots added a nice crunchy texture to each delicious bite.  A must-order, I would've been happy with just eating this the whole night.   Their menu changes often. I missed out on the much-raved about Fried Pig Ears and Oxtail Empanadas, but overall was quite happy & satisfied with our picks tonight.",

The bread was fresh and the Au jus perfectly seasoned. The freshly fried black pepper chips were amazing! They were the perfect thickness, and seasoned well. I would return just for these. I also tried the Cuban sandwich, a.k.a. \"Ricky Ricardo\", it was very good. The plantains and house made pickles were a nice touch. I will definitely return here to try more of their amazing food! PS - get the chips ;)",

    "text": "My family and I were trying to find somewhere good to eat in Vegas on our last night, so we decided to go to Therapy. It is located on the \"old\" Vegas strip and the popular road of Fremont. Therapy has a cozy feel but is still spacious. As some of you know, I love tapas so this was a good place to go. The establishment was clean and the staff was extremely nice.   I love eating tapas because I love to be able to try different options. Here was no different.  -Chorizo Empanadas : Spicy Spanish Chorizo, Bell Pepper & Jalapenono Filled Pastry & Harissa Lime Sauce. These empanadas were very tasty. The pastry shell was fried perfect. The Chorizo inside gave it the perfect flavors and taste. They tasted homemade.   - Charred Brussel Sprouts : Tossed With Brown Butter, Crispy Bacon Lardon, Apples & Toasted Almonds. These by far had to have been the best Brussel Sprouts I have tasted. They were perfect and full of flavor. The crunch on them was perfect, not to hard but not too soft. The bacon added the perfect touch. Overall, an amazing side dish.   - Fried Mac Croquettes: Crispy Fried Mac & Cheese Croquettes With Tomato Bacon Jam & Sriracha Aioli. This dish was interesting. I have had fried Mac and cheese before, but I think the jam and aioli is what made this dish. The jam had a sweet flavor that was good. The Mac and cheese was fried perfect and had a nice crunch. The flavors all went together well in this dish. Yummy!   - Chicken & Waffle Slider : Red Velvet Waffle, Buttermilk Battered Fried Chicken Breast, Red Pepper Remoulade Slaw & Vanilla Maple Syrup. I can honestly say this dish was so, so. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best. The \"Red Velvet\" waffles were definitely NOT Red Velvet in flavor. They literally tasted like a vanilla flavored waffle with red food coloring. I LOVE Red Velvet and know that distinct taste and this was not it. The chicken wasn't bad. It was fried perfect and lended the perfect crunch. The chicken was seasoned pretty well from what I remember as well. Overall, it was ok but it's prettier than it actually taste. *shrugs*  Overall, we had a good dining experience at Therapy. The food was good and the staff was very nice.",

It was really good, meat was tender, fries were to die for. All on all I would say the food was 3.7 of 5. What really made this place was the service was outstanding. Having never eaten here before, our server gave us her honest recommendation and all of us that trusted her had a smile on our face. Atmosphere was laid back with the perfect amount of noisy. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone and will be back.",

I've had a few drinks here but really enjoyed the chocolate old fashioned. It's a little sweet, but something you can't get at a lot of places.  I've had several things to eat here including the Mac n Cheese bites and a wagyu beef burger.  They just didn't measure up to how tasty they should be.  That said, the vibe is worth me coming back and trying a few more things and hopefully increasing their rating.  I really want to like this place but the food next door at Eureka is much better.",

The waffle and chicken were so good, with the vanilla syrup and some sauce for the fried chicken. If the chicken was a little more seasoned, it would have been amazing.

I was recommended to come here by a friend who was completely correct in their recommendation (The Ricky Ricardo sandwich IS absolutely amazing!) but I found the rest of the evening to be pretty hit or miss.  First, my cocktail was gross.  I know, I know... if I didn't like it I should have said something but I hate sending stuff back and I always feel like \"well you ordered it, grin and bear it.\"  I just thought it would be good because it's named after the restaurant.  We got a bunch of apps to share and each of us got an entree.  Some things really stood out as delicious, like the gnudi and the cuban sandwich and some things were just eh, like the devils on horseback and the shortrib.  I think I'd rather be underwhelmed in general than to think some things are excellent and some things are terrible.  A service note that bothered me a bit was that it was my birthday and yet there was no acknowledgment of it.  I mean, I'm not the \"give me free stuff on my birthday\" type but I've never been to a restaurant that didn't even say happy birthday to the birthday person.    Would I come back?  Maybe.  But honestly, probably not...",

Love the interior - it's extremely open with high ceilings. There's plenty of seating inside both on the ground level and upstairs.    The menu is unique and enticing for foodies - I wouldn't recommend if you're a picky eater or looking for something plain and simple (burger and fries). I haven't explored their menu too much but have tried and really enjoyed their Filet Tartare. It was probably one of the best steak tartares I've had in a while! Very soft filet served in a miniature glass jar topped with cheese and egg yolk... absolutely delish! It also came with toasted bread and a few types of pickled veggies (pickled anything are my fav!)     I've only sat at the bar the few times I'ven been and have had excellent bartenders. All quick to refill waters and offer additional drinks.  Would recommend Therapy for a nice date night or a night out with girlfriends!",

    "text": "When downtown (east of Fremont) was not a place for tourists, it was full of small spots for quick bites (or long nights of drinking). Now there are so many restaurants and tourists in the area, it's hard to walk across the street.   Therapy certainly adds to this downtown bustle. It has modern decor and comfy seating. I haven't seen it too busy, so it seems relatively easy to get a table (however I tend to generally avoid the area during peak hours).   The food is okay here. We ordered a couple of small dishes including the \"In the gnudi\" and the fried mac croquettes. The gnudi was tasty filled with ricotta. The truffle fig jam gave it an interesting taste. The fried mac was a little bit like fancy bar food, but good nonetheless.   This place was good, but possibly a little overpriced for my taste. Will have to check it out during a happy hour ;)",

We had the following:   Chorizo empanadas: yummmy...i would get these again. Yes.  In the gnudi: baked ricotta? Omg this was so good. And it tasted just like a holiday dish. I want to make it now for thanksgiving.  Chicken and waffle slider: ill pass. The \"red velvet\" waffle was red, but wheres the flavor? Same with the chicken. It desperately needed seasoning.   Bacon dates: another yes for me. Its bacon how could you not?  I personally ordered the chimichurri steak and it was not good at all. The steak was tough. And i ordered it at medium rare. Can you imagine?   My friends also ordered the big sexy, the shorty and the ricky ricardo. Out of those 3 the ricky ricardo was the best thing. I wish i ordered that instead.   About $200 for 4 people..was it good? Meh. Would i come back? Nah. ",

    "text": "I was recently in there on Tuesday night, during Techno Taco Tuesday. I ordered a drink off of the menu, in which the cost was $13. The bartender brought the drink over, and said \"it will be $17\". I asked why, and he told me that there was a mandatory gratuity of 22%. At that time, I looked at him and said that was not 22%, more like 30%. He printed out the bill, to which it was 16 and some change, with the 22% gratuity fee. First off, I felt as if the bartender was trying to scam me if I was paying cash. It was so dishonest, especially since it was late and there were many drunk people there. This must have been a normal practice. Secondly, the bartender or menu was not forthcoming about the mandatory gratuity.  Never have I been to any establishment where they charge a mandatory 22% gratuity on a single drink. Sadly, I will not be coming back here, and I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.",

I started out with a Chocolate Old Fashioned, which was excellent, just like a regular Old Fashioned, but with a hint of chocolate bitters.  For apps, we enjoyed the empanadas and the \"In The Gnudi\", which consists of Baked Ricotta, Truffle Fig Jam, Roasted Almonds and Cranberry \"Bastard\". Both the apps were great. The empanadas were hot and crispy on the outside and filled with delicious chorizo, also very hot in terms of temperature and with a nice spicy kick. The \"In the Gnudi\" was definitely unique and even knowing the ingredients, it's hard to describe the finished product, but definitely worth trying.   For the main course, we shared the Sliced Chimichurri Steak, which was perfectly cooked, medium rare, tender juicy and very flavorful.  Both the hostess who seated us and our server were extremely friendly and accommodating. I would definitely go back!",

They didn't have a ton of alcohol in them, but they said they were delicious! We split two of the Charred Brussel Sprouts that we're TO.DIE.FOR. We could not believe how delicious they were! I had to have the leftovers boxed up so I would stop eating it and save room for our main course. One friend had the Farro Rissoto. She couldn't believe how good it was. It had a cardamom cream and pomegranate seeds that paired perfectly together. My other friend is a huge Koran food lover and got the Korean BBQ Kimchi. She said it was phenomenal and one of the most authentic and delicious Korean dishes she's ever had! I had The Chick, which was roasted chicken, sweet potato mash, broccolini and a mole sauce. I enjoyed the meal, however it wasn't as noteworthy as my friend's meals. I would definitely recommend trying a different gluten free or normal option off the menu.  Overall one of the best meals we have had on this trip and SO affordable! And thanks to Jonathan for the terrific service!",

One of our servers, Georgie remembered us from a few months ago which was super cool. I really appreciate the friendly atmosphere. When we first stepped in, we were hoping to get a booth...however, we were seated somewhere else. The host actually came by to make sure we were ok and that we were still happy where we ended up sitting.   Now on to the food! I've tried their brussels sprouts, signature salads, shrimp ceviche, ahi tuna, and french dip.  The French Dip is so good alone already without the dip and comes with truffle chips! I like my food simple and not slathered in sauces and so far I haven't tried anything I didn't like. Their chicken and red velvet waffles seem like a popular dish. Will have to try that next time we're in town.  Love this place for their food, decor, comfort and most importantly their really great service!",

It was a good balance of chicken and waffles, though the red velvet made it a little sweeter than usual -Filet Tartar 4/5 stars. My boyfriend loved this dish ate every last bit of it. I wasn't a fan of the bread they paired with it, particularly because I like softer breads than the thin crispy kind they provided -The French Dip: 3/5 stars. Not much to say about it aside from that it was filling.  Service was nice and they gave us a table by the window when I requested for it. Hence, the great lighting on my photos :)",

Regardless, sitting at the bar was awesome. We were tended to by Blake with the help of Shannon who were absolutely fantastic and attentive.   We shared the oxtail empanadas which came in 4 pieces, the fried mac and cheese croquettes, and the red velvet waffle sliders.   We reached the unanimous decision that the fried mac and cheese croquettes won our first place, followed by the red velvet waffle sliders then the oxtail empanadas.    We then met Mike, who gave us the honorable pleasure of tasting the carrot cake and smores dessert. The carrot cake is a MUST GET! I honestly have had only store bought carrot cake and this cake blows your taste buds away!  We are making plans of coming back and trying out more delicious dishes from their menu and is an absolute recommend. Thank you Therapy, the food and service was much needed.",

The waiter was friendly and genuine. But they must have been short handed because he (and one overworked bartender) was the only person serving the entire restaurant at lunch. So of course the wait time was unreasonable. And of course we had  hard time flagging him down. But that was a staffing issue. Not an issue with the staff.   Sadly, the food was just okay. The greatest disappointment of the meal was that they served the same aioli on most of the dishes that we ordered: mac and cheese croquettes, chicken and red velvet waffles (pass on this dish), and the oxtail empanadas.     I enjoyed the texture and crunch (there was lots of crunch) to the dishes, but there were no real distinct flavors to anything. It seems to me that they have a few standout dishes (that tomato soup) and the rest is just the newest take on faux-hipster.    I sound negative, but I have hope for the food here. Everything else seems to be in place.",

Great customer service. We were a big party of 19 and they did not skip a beat with attention, friendliness and fast service.",

    "text": "Came here on the recommendation of a local for some snacks in between gambling and drinking and OMG was it good!  We shared the crab dip and the oxtail empanadas, both of which were home runs!   Crab dip was creamy with generous chunks of crab, served with blue corn tortilla chips for dipping. I wanted to lick the ramekin clean!  Oxtail empanadas are 4 to an order, and probably half the size of typical empanadas making them easier to eat. The oxtail was slow cooked to perfection while the dough was crispy yet pillowy. Served with some sort of yummy aioli.   Judging by the two items we ordered, I don't think you could go wrong with any of the food options. To wash it all down I had a watermelon sangria, which was a bit sweet for my taste, but refreshing nonetheless.  Service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Bartender overheard me say my phone was dying and took it to charge for me.   Would go back in a heartbeat and would recommend to anyone visiting and/or in the area of old skool Vegas.",

Although, the server did say it came medium rare, just next time medium would be better. Anyways, the decor was nice and we really enjoyed watching college football and UFC. The TV's are in the bar area, but luckily we were seated at a table where we could see the screens perfectly. Score!   I can't say much about the cocktails because it was the end of the night and we just ordered coffee and water to drink, although the coffee was really good! I love a good cup of joe when I'm trying to sober up.  I would definitely come here again.",

This place reminds me of one of the 'famous chef' restaurants in Vegas but I am willing to actually come here and pay for it, while other places that are similar in the pretentious vibe and I am not willing to go in. The staff here was really nice and on the ball, I always appreciate that in a place.  I came here with a big group so I was able to try a bunch of their dishes. All the food here was actually really good, a nice surprise, and even though it looks like not enough food on your plate for most dishes, it usual has ended up being just the perfect amount of food. I had the pork sliders which came in a portion of 3, with nothing else but it really was okay, I felt full after eating them.  A burger here will set you back about 16 bucks but it will be worth it. They are made from wagu beef, and one of the best burgers I have had in Vegas living there about 6 years now. It comes with fries too which were handcut and freshly made, a nice touch.The side portion of carrots were interesting to note. They looked like a bunch of freshly picked long stem carrots that were soaked in honey or something similar, but were good. The seafood dishes also looked impressive and no one was unhappy with their meal after we left. They do offer a dessert selection as well, but we were so full that we only tried two of them. Both were good choices-if you want to see pictures of multiple food items of any desserts check out my photos for this place.  Overall I was impressed with the interior, atmosphere, staff attentiveness and quality of the food. Although it was a bit pricey I still felt it was worth it and would be willing to come back here for a date night, or other special event as it is a nicer place.",

The sandwich was a sloppy mess that was so soaked with cooking oil that the bottom bun was soggy and the filling was just slop.   It had so many Red Pepper slices in it you could not taste anything else and the chip were over done and I left them all.  I could not have been more disappointed.  They pretend to be upscale but that's a facade.  It was a total waste of $14 and you would think my my waitress would have asked me how it was when she could clearly see that I was leaving 80% of the meal but maybe they are used to disappointing people.  Avoid this mess of a restaurant. Terrible food!",

We started off with the crab dip YUMMMMMMM (a little skimpy on the lump crab) but the flavor was delicious. We also had order of veggie empanadas and chorizo. The flavor for both was good plus the sauce to dip them in! Lots of shareables here which means portions are small. I would say that was the only negative. Paying a big price for little portions. My husband and I shared the slice steak which was heavenly! Came out a little cold though.. It was a busy Friday so perhaps that's why. We accompanied it with their Mac and cheese! This was my fav of the night. Creamy, cheesy love in a bowl. Serving size only big enough for two but honestly I could have ate the whole bowl myself. Overall, really good food.",

I would understand if it had fine ingredients that cost more money but it dose not.  I do not see this place surviving here at all this will be closed within the year.  The service was horrid as well i was ignored at first when i went to the bar.  I do not know if it was because of the way that i was dressed but honestly it was my day off and i felt like i was judged.  SPEND YOU MONEY ELSE WHERE! go to le thai , pizza rock anywhere in container park! just not here.",

The street corn was tasty;  unexpected flavors come together well. Other reviews have contained complaints about the speed of service, but the restaurant has only been open a few days.  Also,  please take your time, Therapy, and keep producing that off -beat, outstanding food!",

Nice collection of specialty cocktails and a good wine by the glass and beer list. We chose the Annabella and Davis Bynum Pinot noir, which both proved to be an excellent pairing with the food. For our dinner, my wife and her friend chose the beef dip with braised Brussels sprouts as a side, while I ordered the pulled pork sliders. For starters we had the \"in the Gnudi\" featuring Baked ricotta, truffle honey, fig jam, roasted almonds & cranberry & walnut crostini. Wow really delicious! The beef dip came with house made potato chips which were delicious on their own-- crunchy and not too oily. When dinner arrived, in good time I might add, the girls let me know just how good the Brussel sprouts were--just as described by our waitress Georgie, who was very friendly, attentive and made excellent suggestions. The sliders were awesome, with just the right amount of crunch from the cole slaw (and I don't even like cole slaw) while the pork was cooked to perfection. Great dinner-- we'll definitely be back!",

My only downgrade was our reservation was delayed twice but once we were sat everything was absolutely perfect. Our table started with the pretzel bread, stuffed dates and crostini apps. My one minor complaint would be the cheese sauce with the pretzel bread was a little bland but still decent enough.  For entrees we shared a selection of house Mac n cheese, shrimp scampi, pork chops and braised short ribs( we tried to order the steak but they had run out. The server's spot on recommendation of the short ribs more then made up for it). All of the entrees were cooked perfectly and were full of flavor. On top of the great food, our server could not have been more professional and attentive to our table. I can see why Therapy has some of the best reviews in Downtown Vegas. The mixture of great food and top notch service is a must visit for any visitors to Downtown Las Vegas.",

After drink orders were taken, we order appetizers,immediately, because of the time wait. We ordered the Oxtails Empanadas and the Devils on Horseback. The Devils on Horseback came out first - which were ok. The Romesco sauce was excellent. 5 minutes later the Empanadas came out. Which were basically shredded beef inside dough - which tasted mostly like dough (\"Oxtail\" being the catch phrase). Blech! So Appetizers came out separately and took 20 minutes. I ordered the Super Mac w/chicken and my wife ordered the Hanger Steak Tartar. Mine was basically a white cheese Chef-Boy-R-Dee Mac-n-cheese with a grilled, no taste stringy chicken breast, and my wife's was a pickled nightmare of some eclectic vegetables and some type of ground beef (of which we could not decide). I'm not a picky eater, but for the $$$ price, don't waste your time.",

We had been there for drinks before but never for the food, but we've heard good things. The bartender was ok, not exactly friendly, but after we got our drinks and looked over the menu with a few suggestions from the bartender, we ordered a cheese plate and the steak tartar. After almost 25 min, I asked the bartender if they forgot about us, but she didn't seem to excited to help since she looked like she was checking out for the night. When the manager finally brought the cheese plate, he apologized and said we were behind a big party that ordered a lot of food. I can appreciate that, except for the fact that I could see the restaurant wasn't exactly busy or even close to capacity. I honestly felt like I was bothering everyone just to have a drink and appetizers. The food was good, but I have to say, I probably won't ever go back because there are so many other options downtown and I want to feel like I am welcomed, not a hustle.",

I have sat at a table, and at the bar.    They have a nice variety on their menu, with healthy options, and no-so-healthy offerings, big plates and small plates, a fun cocktail menu, and a variety of beers and wines.  I tend to stick to their \"Bites\" menu - plus these dishes are discounted during Happy Hour.  They are famous for their empanadas - I've tried every flavor and you should too!  The Devils on Horseback are as sinfully delicious as you expect them to be, and the \"In the Gnudi\" is a fun take on gnocchi that I really liked.  The service is a little cold, but not bad enough to keep me from coming back.  It's on my regular rotation of Vegas restaurants.",

Service is mostly good but I also had a bad waitress before. I like the environment. It's spacious and well designed with the industrial feel. It's a place I would keep coming back.   Some of the things I've tried,  1. Oxtail empanadas (4/5): one of my favorite thing on the menu. Although it seemed like it looked more like a potsticker than an empanada now when I went today.  2. Chicken meatballs (4/5): this dish is light with chicken and I loved the cilantro jalapeno pesto. It inspired me to be creative when I make my own pesto sauce.   3. Charred kale salad (4/5): I liked the grill flavor and loved the egg yolk on my kale.   4. Fried pig ear (5/5): I loved the fried pig ear, but it gets bit much after 4 pieces.   5. Steak (2/5): I've tried the steak here once and I wouldn't order it again. The quality of the steak here is under average.   6. Hanger steak tartar(dinner)/ fillet tartar(lunch) (3/5): I've tried both and they were just mediocre steak tartar to me. They are not well seasoned. I can do with or without.   7. Chicken and red velvet waffles (2/5): I love love chicken and waffle. However, the waffle here was soggy. I didn't really enjoy this dish. I've even told the waiters a few times. Hopefully they make the waffle more crispy now.   8. Shrimp scampi (3/5): light white wine sauce with fresh shrimp. Not too bad.   9. Fire roasted street corn (3/5): it would be bit better if they added more seasoning, the lime and the Parmesan cheese.   10. Cast iron s'mores with bacon (4/5): add bacon! It's free anyway and the bacon flavor makes the dish a bit less sweet which I like.   11. In the \"gundi\" (3/5): I love the baked ricotta with truffle honey, but they don't make this dish as good as some of the places I go to.   12. The perfect cure (5/5): I enjoyed some of their spicy cured meats selection.",

The Mac and cheese croquettes where amazing and not the mention the chicken balls where also flavorful. Must try this place out.  Came in again. This time we got the salad with NO bacon. Awesome. Then the artichoke dip. The best. MUST HAVE. The shrimp cocktail was okay. And for the main coarse we got the shirt steak. Have them put the Chimichurri sauce on the side. I didn't care for it too tangy for my taste buds especially the the meat is covered with the sauce.",

If you're like me and appreciate a good beet or two, this plate had different colored beets, goat cheese, pistachios & some green things? All was yummy! My friend & I also shared the french dip , quite tasty. Could have used a different roll but great au jus. Our first choice was the red velvet waffle & fried chicken, but to our dismay was sold out! The horror! We had a brief cry.... Overall, such a cute establishment, wish we had one in San Diego.",

Also had the Smash which is one of there signature cocktails. I would not have thought of putting blackberries in bourbon but it really worked and was very tasty! Give it a try!

    "text": "Went here for a lunch outing with a company I worked for during the summer. It was a few days after Therapy opened in July. I drove by Therapy this morning and was reminded of my awful experience and felt compelled to share.   I walked by Therapy a few weeks before the lunch outing and heard Dead Kennedys' \"California Uber Alles\" blaring from their doorstep at 11 a.m., so I had a positive initial impression.   Our party of close to two dozen was seated at a long table in the back. The decor was wood and metal and the kitchen was open which added to the homey, comfortable vibe. Two waitresses were taking care of us. I looked through the menu with my vegan lenses and narrowed it down to three items; a salad, a flatbread or a side. I wanted something filling with a variety of flavors so I decided on the summer squash flatbread and ordered it without cheese. I informed the waitress upon ordering that I cannot have meat or dairy and she said she was nearly certain my order would suit my needs, but if there was an issue she would let me know.  The entrees came out and the waitress informed me the dough for the flatbread contained dairy. Since the entrees had already arrived, I asked her what other menu items I could have. She frantically looked at the menu for a few minutes and suggested the mixed greens salad without Parmesan.   I didn't want to waste any more time so I agreed. I was pretty disappointed since I was looking forward to something filling and toothsome. I remembered I had stashed a trusty and incredibly tasty Trader Joe's $3.99 vegan BBQ chicken wrap in the fridge at work the day before so I was less annoyed since I wouldn't have to be hungry for the rest of the work day. The salad was the most pathetic plate I've seen in a while. Half the plate was empty and the salad was dressed spring mix and a few radish slices.   The owner came by after I had a few bites and asked the group which dishes everyone enjoyed. People replied with this and that and he asked one of my coworkers what he thought of the mac and cheese. \"I'm lactose intolerant so I couldn't try it,\" he replied. The owner said with a chuckle, \"Well you don't matter.\" I saw a few people look my way and the owner quickly walked away from the awkward silence after his comment.   I was taken aback and frankly insulted that a restaurant owner in downtown Las Vegas would say that customers who can't eat dairy don't matter. Even as a joke. The absence of vegan items, besides some overpriced spring mix, made a lot more sense after his comment.   By no means do I think they need to do a menu overhaul. The dishes that came out looked very creative and fun (like the red velvet waffles and chicken), but in a neighborhood where you can get various dairy-free lattes, vegan nachos, vegan pizza and vegan donuts asserting people who can't have dairy don't matter is asinine.",

It had everyone's attention and we all kept picking items to share.  It was fun but hard as everything just kept getting better.  Must haves: Beef Tartar.....wow, just wow. Brussels sprouts....we couldn't stop eating them Empanadas Chorizo was my fave but the oxtail were great too  We can't wait to go back for the items we missed.    Thank you Team Therapy.

I can't comment on the staff other than that they were incredibly kind and helpful.  Anyway!  I think this place is great! Admittedly, for perhaps the first time ever, I didn't actually read any reviews for this place, I just saw tapas and was like heck yeah that's what I want. I came here on a Saturday night with my partner, who's a chef and it's honestly so hard to please sometimes. Well he was skeptical and said the menu toed the line between inventive and pretentious, and I told him to shush and give it a fair shot. And honestly I think we were both really pleasantly surprised!! I got the fruit salad thing, and the \"gnudi\" dish. He got one of the burgers. We ended with a souffle.  Everything was great. He made a comment about being relived that they knew how to make a good burger. I was in love with both things I ordered. Our desert was very rich but it wasn't huge so we finished it pleasantly full. The portion sizes were totally appropriate.   For a Saturday around 9, we walked in without a reservation and got seated immediately. The service was prompt and polite. It's a little loud? That might be my only complaint to be honest. Our food came out quickly.   Anyway. Like I said, idk what's going on with all the negative stuff. I can't comment on that. All I can say is this place is definitely worth coming to!",

    "text": "It's neat to see what Therapy has become, especially considering where it started. What used to be a complete dump of a horrible tourist gift shop is now one of the nicer lounge type restaurants in the area. Not only does Therapy have a full bar if you're looking to just stop in for a drink, but there are dining areas both downstairs and upstairs. It's another great example of the revitalization of downtown.  Our first visit here was a somewhat short one. We had just finished dinner around the corner, and decided to stop in for a drink. Alongside a handful of beers on tap, they have a few signature cocktails and house-made sangrias. For the ridiculously hot days in Vegas, they even offer some frozen drinks. I decided to give The Smash! a shot after hearing good things about it, but unfortunately wasn't a huge fan. The bourbon was there, but not much of it and completely masked by the blackberry and sweetened lime.   On our next visit, we sat down with a party of about 10 and ordered up about as much as we could on the menu. Much like the direction many new restaurants are taking, Therapy has two sections of the menu called \"The Social Club\" and \"Bites\" which focus on shareable plates. Of the 15 items between the two sections, we ended up ordering 10 of them.  A few things that stood out for me were the Chicken & Red Velvet Waffle Sliders, Shrimp Ceviche and the Hangar Steak Tartar. The chicken and waffle sliders are actually pretty big and if ordered alone could probably be a dinner for some. I liked the large, juicy piece of chicken and the mild sweetness from the waffle. It also has a spicy remoulade that adds a nice little kick. And while the ceviche was real heavy on the tomato flavor, but mild on the citrus, I still enjoyed it. It was fresh, bright and flavorful. As far as the tartar goes, I think i was one of the few at our table who enjoyed it. I haven't had tartar at many restaurants, but I liked the seasoning in addition to the egg and crispy grilled bread.   We didn't order a whole lot from the larger plates, but we did have a couple items that are worth mentioning. The Charred Kale is an excellent salad that was really one of the top items of the night. It had amazing flavor and I loved both the fresh egg and bacon smoked bacon vinaigrette topping it. Another surprising favorite was The French Dip. This sandwich is not the typical dry bread, low quality meat and oily ju that you find almost everywhere else. The flavors were spot on, the meat was tender and juicy, and the sandwich as a whole just had the right amount of heat from the horseradish. It's also served with crispy chips that have a present, but deliciously addicting truffle flavor.   To finish out the night, we ordered 3 out of their 4 desserts. The Cast Iron Smores was crazy sweet, and could definitely benefit from a little more bacon to offset that. Both the Crumbled Carrot Cake and Pure Decadence chocolate cake were much better, but still probably not something I'd order again. I did really enjoy the brown butter ice cream though that was on the carrot cake, and would probably order that alone if it was offered.  Because we ordered nearly 20 items from the menu and only a few were things I'd come back for, I don't think I'd rush back. We also had less than stellar service. For whatever reason, our waiter forgot to put in an order of the Cheddar Mac & Cheese, which was something quite a few of our party was anticipating. She admitted to forgetting it, but after asking her to still put the order in, she either forgot again, or blew it off. This was basically towards the end of our meal too, and we had already asked for it twice before that. Shortly after, we watched another table next to us get an order of it, then our table was cleaned off and she started asking about dessert. Luckily she remembered to take it off the bill, but it was still frustrating to miss a dish that was asked for multiple times.  After 2 visits, I'm still a bit torn on Therapy. They've definitely got a lot to offer, and it's another great addition to the \"New Downtown\", but some things just fall a little short to bump this up to 4 stars.",

The chicken, while seasoned on the outside, was a thick cut that did not carry much flavor, even when dipped in the wine Sauce.  The bacon wrapped dates were the best.  staff was great and attentive.",

My boyfriend and I ordered the soup of the day (the lobster bisque), the crab and artichoke dip, and the short rib with creamy polenta all for the two of us to share. Our friend then order the Chicken and Waffles sliders and the other the Ricky Ricardo (a cuban sandwich of some sort).   The first thing to come out is the lobster bisque which is lukewarm at best (it had obviously been sitting there for a while). We decided to send it back for a fresh bowl (this time it came out hot) and then another 5 minutes and we received our Short Rib Entree, another 5 minutes and the chicken and waffle sliders come out. I thought it was strange the timing of everything and then another 15 minutes goes by before the crab and artichoke dip and the cuban sandwich came out. The server had said that he thought we were all sharing everything (trying to cover for the kitchen); however based on what we ordered and how we ordered that was unlikely. The food was actually really good and I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the untrained kitchen and their horrible timing of serving dishes together.   We will prob give Therapy another try when we are downtown and not with a group or in a hurry.",

    "text": "It feels bar-ish from the outside and when you first walk in but their menu is so much more than bar food!   Most of it is small plates to share but they do have a spoon & fork section on the menu that is meant to be larger portions.  Upstairs is perfect for getting more of a restaurant vibe.    Service was good-ish and a bit off-timed.  Not to the point of being awful or anything...little things like taking food order before getting drinks in, not bringing enough water glasses, refilling only when we asked, slow to clear some plates but collecting others as we were still eating off them (literally) and not knowing the menu.  Again, it wasn't terrible....these are just some reasons it's not a 5.  They were out of a few liquors so they couldn't make some of their specialty drinks.  Not a deal breaker for me.   Can never go wrong with vodka!  The food!!!  Everything was good (+) to delish (++) to awesome (+++)!   Not a bad plate in the bunch.  We had chicken meatballs+++, roasted asparagus+, mac & cheese+++, the meat/cheese plate++, steak tartare+++, bacon wrapped dates  ++, the (HUGE)porkchop+++, (jumbo)shrimp scampi+++, mushroom flatbread(which is really puff pastry)+++, squash flatbread++ & the ceviche+    Desserts....GET THE CARROT CAKE.   Did you hear me?  Just do it....despite the description & despite the pictures that make it look like a heaping pile of mess.  I only like my mothers carrot cake so a bit of a \"snob\".  I L-O-V-E-D this carrot cake with its sugared nuts, dollops of icing & mixed up texture.   Soooo crazy rich and huge -- plan to share!   The chocolate cake was pretty but taste was meh (had fridge flavor)....don't waste the calories.    Parking is a bit of a challenge.  El Cortez is the cheapest & probably the safest.    Bottom line....not a morsel left on a single plate (even the meh choc cake) & we'll definitely be back!",

It's a small restaurant but it wasn't crowded (mid-day on a Saturday) so that was a plus. The drinks were delilsh. The oxtail empanadas were AMAZING! I would go back just for those. I had the chicken and red velvet waffles as a main dish. Not as fantastic as the empanadas but was still a great choice. One of the members of our party is vegan and they went out of their way to create an eggplant dish especially for her. She seemed to enjoy it. I don't visit Fremont street too often but would definitely frequent this restaurant again when I am in the area. I wish I could remember my server's name to give him a personal shout out (Black gentleman, nice build, working on 6/17 around 2:30PM). But everyone truly rocked from the cook, bartender, server to the hostess. It was truly and enjoyable experience.",

The Cuban sandwich was not the typical, but this one was quite tasty. We also tried the meat \"empanadas\" (can't remember the name, if different), and they were also very good. Almost gave it a 5, a booth would have been better than sitting at a table next to the kitchen/ bathroom - wink. Enjoy :)",

Unfortunately, the kitchen did not! I noticed my companion was struggling with his Ricky Ricardo, a Cuban-style sandwich with pulled pork. I tried a bite, & I could see why. I honestly thought it was Tuna Fish, & I asked him why he got such an odd variation on a classic Cuban. I was shocked when I found out it was pulled pork. Yuck!",
