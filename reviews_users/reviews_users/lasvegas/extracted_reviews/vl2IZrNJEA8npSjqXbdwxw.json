    "text": "Go with a group and sample as many pancake flavors as you can! They were all surprising and delicious.  If you're going to spend $ on breakfast, this is the place to do it. I honestly HATE spending money on breakfast. What is a pancake, except for some flour and water? And Let's be real, waffles are WAAAAAY better.   Except here! We found BabyStacks when looking online at places to eat off the strip. We live in Ut and make the trek to Las Vegas a few times a year. Buffets and overpriced hotel food gets old. When we heard about the red velvet pancakes, we figured it was worth the drive.   BabyStacks, is really small, and if you get there are the wrong, time or with a larger group expect to wait. We were a party of 4 and waited about 25 minutes on a week day. It is a family run establishment and everyone is really friendly and nice. They are quick to refill your drinks and check in a few times to see if you need anything else, and to make sure everything is tasting great. The staff was really accommodating- my mom wanted Adobo but no rice, and not in a full plate. They threw in a side for her, free of charge so she could taste it. Maybe it was because we ordered so many damn pancakes.   We decided to just go hog wild. We ordered 6 small stacks so we could all try different pancakes: red velvet, carrot cake, rocky road, orange creamsicle, white chocolate macadamia Nut & banana cream pie. They were surprisingly delicious. We figured we would find one or two that was a miss, but we didn't. The carrot cake was my favorite, and the orange creamsicle tasted just like the popsicle of my childhood. I only wish they had a sampler platter so that you could taste a variety of pancakes.   We will defiantly be going back on our next trip to finish tasting the rest of the pancake menu.",

We were greeted and sat down right away we had a drink orders taken by Ariana she was great and polite! We did need a couple of mins for ordering food. Since, there is a lot of good food to choose from! I had the loco moco with spinach and mushrooms added to it! I had medium poached eggs, which were perfect! Everything was very delicious the macaroni salad tasted homemade which it's a plus!! I also ordered a baby stack the white chocolate macadamia very delicious! My sister in the other hand went the healthier way and had the Veggie Skillet with avocado added and subbed eggwhites! Finally eggwhites that are white and not burnt! She ordered a babsystack as well the famously known red velvet which are amazing!!",

The only downfall of this place is the wait time. If you're in the mood for a quick breakfast, this is not the place. It's best to arrive early because the wait time is usually 30-45 minutes. They are expanding to a Centennial location, so that's good news! All in all, great breakfast spot.",

The best part about eating with the family that I was able to taste also the banana cream pie pancakes and adobo burrito! Everything I tastes was really good! I see why there was a line!

    "text": "The cousins and I ordered: 1.)  RED VELVET    7.95 (FULL) 5.25 (SHORT) Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup. This tasted super delicious.  It wasn't too fluffy nor was it heavy.  Normally when I eat pancakes from other establishments, I feel very heavy.  The combination of the whipped cream with the chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup blended well together.  2.)  RICK'S ADOBO FRIED RICE  8.50 A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions. I thought it was just okay.  I wasn't too much of a fan with the egg since it had no flavor to it.  My cousin said that because the Adobo Fried Rice already has enough flavor, to add sodium to the egg would just possibly be too salty.  I think I would just like the Adobo Fried Rice without the egg wrapped around it.  3.)  KALUA PIG BENEDICT  9.75 A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and our delicious hollandaise sauce. This was my favorite.  I would come back here for this because I just love Eggs Benedict.  The taste of the Kalua Pig gave it a flavor that matched well with the Hollandaise Sauce.  A lot of people on Yelp felt that it was too bland.  I found adding some salt to the dish pepped that up.    4.) NUTELLA CREPES  8.25 plain or 9.25 (with seasonal strawberries) Nutella mixed filling spread topped with fresh whipped cream and almonds.   This was definitely a great way to end our meal.  It wasn't too overpowering with the Nutella and had the right amount in the crepe.  I'm not really a dessert person, but this was well done.  It doesn't look too hard to make.",

    "text": "When you're out of town and you're in Vegas, you just want to be in the middle of the action and be on the strip. Going anywhere outside the strip just seems sketchy, right? We wanted to meet up a couple of friends, who are both locals, for brunch. We suggested going to the buffet at The Cosmopolitan and they both gave us these hesitant, unsure faces. They suggested going to this local mom and pops place instead, which is off the strip. Then it was my turn to give the hesitant, unsure look. But when they mentioned \"Adobo fried rice\" and \"red velvet pancakes\", I was convinced.  Baby Stacks is a small restaurant located in a shopping strip. I was told it was originally named \"Baby Cakes\", but people kept thinking it was a bakery so they had to change the name.  The place definitely looks like an unpretentiously casual, local diner. Nothing fancy, no frills. Scanning the menu, the theme of the restaurant seemed to be Hawaiian with items like \"Loco moco\" and \"Kalua pork egg benedict\".  Our server, Lori (or Laurie, Lawry, Lorie, Loree...), who was a very agreeable lady came to take our orders. I decided on getting the \"Loco Moco with garlic fried rice\", my bf got the \"Adobo fried rice\" and we both got half a stack of the Red Velvet cupcakes.  I loved EVERYTHING! I was surprised with how I shamelessly devoured everything, considering that I have a very little stomach for food. Maybe, it's my genetic predisposition to love white rice.  The Loco Moco has 2 solid beef patties atop rice. (It originally comes with steamed rice but I strongly suggest you get the garlic fried rice instead.) 2 eggs go on top of everything while smothered by some tasty gravy! Ultimate comfort food!!! The adobo fried rice is genius idea! You get fried rice mixed with chicken adobo pieces (you can also do garlic fried rice) wrapped in beaten egg. Exactly, it is an adobo fried rice omelet. The Red Velvet pancakes were the perfect way to finish our meal! You think you wouldn't have room for it? Think again! The half stack comes with 3 pancakes while the full stack comes with 6. The pancakes are sprinkled with mini chocolate chips with a side of sweet cream cheese sauce.  I am soooo glad I was convinced to get off the strip. You can almost never go wrong with mom and pops restaurants. *BURRRP!*",

Sometimes... check that... frequently, hype overshadows the actual product. Thankfully, this was not the case with Babycakes. For all the praise showered upon the Red Velvet Pancakes, they still uber-deliciously and surprisingly exceeded my expectations. They are easily the best pancakes I've ever had. Red Velvet Pancakes with the Cream Cheese that they provide  regular pancakes with maple syrup.  We also ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Benedict, and Nutella Crepes. I like how the fried rice is wrapped in an egg to make it sort of like an omelet. My cousin, Sarah N, commented that the egg was bland, but I think it works well with the saltiness of the Adobo. The Kalua Pig Benedict was also yummy. I do love a good [insert food adjective here] Benedict and this one works for me. Finally, the Nutella Crepes totally hit the spot to end our meal. Strangely enough, I'm more of a savory crepe person but this one also works for me.  I wish they weren't so far from home. Or maybe it's a good thing they're not near my house.  5 stars",

Obviously, by the look of everyone's review its screaming out RED VELVET PANCAKES!!! Once I saw those three words, I immediately bookmarked it! I was sooo stoked when my girlfriends and I went on Sunday morning. There were groups of people standing outside and my first thought was \"this place is serious.\" It was a bit of a drag with the wait time taking more than 30 mins since we were starving. So definitely must come early on weekends.   I ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes of course. You have a choice of ordering the short stack (3 pancakes) or the big stack (6 pancakes). It was absolutely amazing. So fluffy. So velvety. And the cream cheese syrup adds the cherry on top. It was pure heaven in my mouth. I had one of those silent moments to myself for a good 3 mins (: I've gotten to try the Smores pancakes as well from my cousin's order. It was also good but it did not compare to the red velvet.   I've also tried some of the Kalua Pig Benedict from one of my girlfriends, which has the toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. That was a good choice! The meat was tender and juicy. Plus adding ketchup and hot sauce to it made it more flavorful! I love spice.   I was completely satisfied with my whole experience. The staff, the service, the quality of the food, and the atmosphere of Babycakes Cafe were fantastic! Spread the word... this place is phenomenal.",

    "text": "Stopped in after hearing all the raves regarding the red velvet pancakes and the kalua pig benedict....Noticed a few local hawaiian and filipino dishes-portuguese sausage, loco moco, spam, adobo fried rice omelette and kalua pig!? for breakfast???  So I ask my waitress if the owner was from Hawaii....\"No, she's not from Hawaii, she's just been there a few times\" Uh-oh.............I take my chances anyway and go with the benedict and forego the potatoes and pay a little extra for a side of the red velvet pancakes.  Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and an egg is really hard to screw up, but these cooks did a great job at that. I felt like I was cutting into an egg mc muffin because the yolk wasn't oozing like it should have if you know how to poach an egg. Hollandaise looked and tasted instant and I know wasn't made fresh. And how are you gonna have carnitas pass as kalua pig? same meat, different preparations....definitely lacking saltinesss and smokiness you get from properly made kalua pig....definitely failed on execution here.  Red Velvet Pancakes were good and I'll just stick to the non-local items if there is a return visit. Some may disagree on my 3-star rating, but being a stickler for  good food DONE RIGHT, I call it like I taste and see it and I'm sticking to my guns......BANG BANG!!!!.......................................................ALOHA!!!",

I've heard that when you have more than one child you love them both equally and there are no favorites (I would imagine anyway, lol). Well that's how I feel about both of the items I had. I loved them both equally ;)  Our server was great, awful chipper for early in the AM. The best part? Not sure who she was but an older women saw my brother and I walking up from the parking lot and opened the door for us welcoming us in and already had menus in hand \"follow me\" she says. I'm such a sucker for excellent customer service. Aww shucks :)))))",

In Vegas?  Come on, who's out of bed before 2pm in Vegas.  I had the peanut butter and banana pancakes and was a bit disappointed... the PB flavor was very faint (to me), but the waitress brought me a side of peanut butter to make up for it.  My girlfriend had the strawberry pancakes and she said it was one of the best pancakes she has ever had.  And she's a pancake fiend!  We somehow didn't get the red velvet pancakes, but we plan to get it next time.  Oh, we had a side of hash browns, too, and they were really, really good.  So close to a 5 star.  Make it 24 hours, guys.  Please?!",

    "text": "What's HOT on YELP right now?! You got it! Babycakes Cafe!  I just had the most amazing brekkie ever!  I can see why they Red Velvet Pancake is getting sooo much attention.  They're no joke!  I think it's because of that special cream cheese syrup!  I mean, I thought it was crack at first since it made my heart skipped a beat, but nah!  It jolted because it was getting a reincarnation.  At first i was skeptical after reading all the reviews that this dish alone would be too sweet, but that first bite was just heavenly that even the angels sang. Glad I saved this for last.  My friend and I shared a few other dishes.  We had the Kalua Pig Benedict which were amazing.  The pork was surprisingly tender and not overly salty.  Very good balance between the eggs and hollandaise sauce.  I annihilated this one.   The Loco Moco was also fantastic and hit the spot as well.  Two homemade hamburger patties over a bed of rice with an egg on top then smother in brown gravy.  Delish!!  This was my friend's favorite.  We also had an order of the Adobo Fried Rice wrapped in an egg omelet.  This was my 2nd time having adobo since 10 years ago, so i can't really comment on that other than that it was a tad bit salty.  But in all honestly I think it worked out perfectly since we both enjoyed this dish.  With it's charming staff and appealing atmosphere I can see this cute cafe being a local's favorite very soon.  *side note* We got to sample their homemade country gravy and man that was the best i ever tasted.  So good we ate straight up with a spoon.  Don't judge. Can't wait til we come back to try it with their fried steak or dare i say it, biscuit *gasp*  *side note 2*  This can't be good for my diet.   Tip:  Hide y0 kids, Hide y0 wife.  Hide y0 husband because Babycakes is feeding eberybody up in hea..",

    "text": "I was skeptical this place would live up to the hype, but OMG did it ever! The 30 minute drive from my house, the 40 minute wait, all freaking worth it. This will never be a regular spot for me (5000 calories for bfast isn't a habit I need to get into!), but for a special breakfast this is the best place I've been off the strip in Vegas (sorry, Bouchon is still my overall fav!).   They get major props for letting you pay a minimal charge to upgrade to the \"specialty' pancakes when ordering any of the egg dishes. Honestly the smaller (2?) portion of these sweet things is perfect and it's nice to have an egg dish AND a dessert to go with it !   I had the breakfast burrito (special from the chalk board) and red velvet pancakes. The breakfast burrito wasn't much of a burrito (well not in a stupidly huge Chipotle sense), but more of a large taco. This was absolutely perfect for me - huge burritos are a turn off and I don't like the ingredient ratio you get with this burrito the size of your face. Burrito (bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes) was perfect, but the red velvet pancakes did steal the show! Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Ridiculously fluffy, perfect red velvet flavor - you must try these !  My husband has a certain fondness for chicken fried steak and sausage gravy. He's tried it everywhere here in town from Tiffany's to all the casino diners. He's always bummed that it's not nearly as good as what he's used to from TX. This place was by far the best we've had in Vegas and might be better than any in TX as well. The steak was tender (not chewy and gross), the batter was nice, and OMG the gravy was perfect. It seemed to not be frozen, or they buy an incredibly high quality frozen product - either way, they fooled me. Tasted homemade! He had the smores pancakes that were tasty, but not nearly as good as the Red Velvet!!  I never thought I'd find a local place with BETTER pancakes than my favorite (Oreo Banana Pancakes at Bongo Room in Chicago, btw), but honestly they were! I'd put this breakfast spot up against any diner, anywhere. I'd love to see them add some coffee drinks to the menu (oh and expand to Henderson!).",

All tables were in use but there was no other people waiting but us.  So we waited about 10 minutes and immediately got seated.  It really is a small restaurant so be prepared to wait upon arrival if you go in the afternoon.  I ordered the Adobo fried rice omelette and gf ordered the kalua pig eggs benedict.  \"Hey babe, wanna try this?\" I said this because i wanted to try hers! HEHHEHE!!  Kalua Benedict was a different taste, but way better than the classic eggs benedict.  But dont get me wrong, i was happy with my Adobo fried rice omelette, filling indeed and it came with some bomb mac salad.  (QUICK NOTE: mix some tabasco in with the mac salad! gives it a kick! a karate-judo-brazillian jiu-jitsu-MMA-KICK!)  Next is the Red Velvet pancakes, MY GOSH!! they're so good it deserves its own paragraph! Super moist on the inside, crispy outer rim crust. and  the cream cheese syrup and the whipped cream complimented it so well.   Good thing we only ordered the short-stack to share.  We had it as our desert for after our breakfasts.  Our total bill came out to $24 bucks.  not bad eh?  Our waitress was nice and friendly, polite and brief. No complains there.  They also had 2 big tv's to watch while waiting for your food.  All in all, i recommend this place to everyone, and I will bring my friends and family here if/when they come and visit.",

Imagine my excitement double when I saw that they also had white chocolate macademia nut pancakes on their daily specials board.   The pancakes were excellent, and I really thought it couldn't get any better...until I took a bite of the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the pulled pork, and cabbage were amazing. My expectations were pretty high, but everything tasted twice as good as it sounded. The only downside is that the restaurant is really small.  There was a 1 hour wait when we got there at 11:30am on Sunday.  By 12:30-1pm it slowed down considerably.  I will probably just try going later next time.",

Both of us loved these and will probably order them if we end up back on this side of town for breakfast.  Service was great!

The taste and atmosphere went well beyond my expectations.    Our orders consisted of:  - Red Velvet Pancakes - I suggest you get the short stack if you're not a big eater, because even that felt a lot.  The taste and consistency of the pancake was amazingly delicious, and the cream cheese syrup is what made the taste even better.    - S'mores Pancake - I've always been a big fan of s'mores, but for some reason this dish just didn't catch me.  It was good, but I was under the impression that the batter would have s'mores in it.  Probably something I wouldn't order again.  - Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict - OMG! you won't believe how amazing this dish was. Everything about it was just delicious! This dish made my trip worth while.  The flavors of everything just bursts in your mouth, like a \"FOOD ORGASM!\" Ok, probably not the right choice of words, but I wouldn't know how else to describe it.

It's a small, cozy place - decorated with HUGE butterflies on the wall [oddly enough, I didn't notice them until my friend pointed them out].   Service was great. Friendly smiles all around, and good about keeping the coffee cups filled.  I ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict, which were amazing. The only semi bad thing was that they were a little heavy handed on the amount of Hollandaise sauce - but that is something that can easily be fixed. Coffee was decent enough to drink black. It looked as if their whipped cream is homemade, which always gives cool points to an establishment.  Unfortunately, we were seated right next to the counter where the food goes out, so I was forced to watch all the delicious food being delivered to everybody. Which, ultimately made me want to keep ordering more food so that I could try everything on the menu. But alas - I couldn't, as the Benedict more than satisfied my hunger.  Needless to say, I will be back to try everything I saw coming out of the kitchen. From the red velvet pancakes to the crepes to the humongous French toast - I can't wait to conquer everything on their menu.",

    "text": "Leaving Las Vegas en route for Los Angeles we'd originally considered traveling pastries from Bouchon versus our leftovers from Robuchon as breakfast - at least until I heard about Babycakes Cafe.  Highly regarded on Yelp! and reported to be committed to local high quality ingredients the small shop was a brief detour and, honestly, how often do I have a car at my disposal in Las Vegas?  Opening at 7am we woke early, loaded the car, and arrived at the restaurant at 7:05 - so early the coffee hadn't even finished brewing.  Entering the restaurant we were greeted sleepily by a young Hispanic woman at the front and seated by a young Hispanic man who would also act as our server throughout the meal.  With water poured menus were delivered and once coffee and tea were optioned for we were told it would be a few moments as water was still boiling and coffee still brewing.  Low on decor we sat back and watched highlights of DeSean Jackson lighting up the Giants on the plasma screen until the young man returned with beverages and took our orders.  With quality service throughout the meal - coffee refilled frequently and water never empty - we watched the restaurant slowly fill to half capacity while we waited...and from my vantage point I watched the kitchen, a two man operation running the griddles and grills with great speed and skill.  With the time just shy of 7:30 our plates would arrive - each warm, well prepared, and accompanied with appropriate toppings in small plastic cups.  The first plate, ordered by my sister, was the short stack of Peanut Butter and \"make your own combination!\" pancakes - in her case banana and chocolate.  Served with maple syrup the pancakes were decent but not spectacular - a mild peanut butter taste within and chopped bananas and chocolate chips atop.  My aunt's selection, a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles and served with cream cheese syrup would fare better than my sister's choice, albeit largely only because of the syrup.  Cocoa tinged, thin, and somewhat crisp on the exterior the pancakes themselves were tasty while the addition of the chocolate crumbles lent some textural variation and the whipped cream was expectedly sweet.  In the cup, imagine a mildly citrus cream cheese frosting thinned out - a great idea that worked nicely on both this dish and my selection.  As we'd be dining on Red Velvet pancakes for the next two days I feel obligated to note that these were the worst of the group by a large margin.  For my choice, Carrot Cakes - certainly the most interesting of our pancake selections with shredded carrots and pecans studding the batter.  Topped with more crumbled pecans and the same lovely syrup served with the red velvet options I actually enjoyed my short stack quite a bit and was glad I'd opted for less food so I could sample some of my mother's choice - the best of the meal.  Titled Honey Toast and described as \"two pieces of thick sliced honey toast dipped in a farm fresh egg wash and cooked to perfection! Then drizzled with sweet honey. Yummy!\" I will have to agree with Babycake's assessment - they were prefect and yummy.  Significant in size and heft the two thick slices of toast were perfectly caramelized on the exterior and custard within while the slowly melting whipped cream and honey proved to be a smooth and sweet balance without being overly saccharine.  While superfluous, I will note the house syrup was actually quite good - it reminded me of the Sweet Syrup at Camellia Grill in New Orleans.  Settling the modest bill - a mere $7.50/each with tax and tip - at the front before making our way to the car we were bid farewell and told to come back soon.  While I'll admit that in retrospect I rather wish we'd have simply gotten some pastries for the road, I certainly did not dislike Babycakes - it just wasn't worth the special trip.  While the small cafe would be well suited for a city like Columbus or Toledo, given the quality of the competition in Las Vegas it just doesn't stack up, even if the price is a steal compared to options on the strip - I'd much sooner venture to Hash House a Go Go (on strip or off.)",

The Pancakes were light and fluffy just the way my wife likes them and I tried the Huevos Rancheros which were pretty cool. Kind of like tostadas. The wife tried the Adobo's Fried Rice wrapped inside of an omelette. Will be back. And if the owners are reading this, add the Tiramasu Pancakes permanently to the menu! They are incredibly good.",

    "text": "One of the biggest reasons we go to Vegas is to explore all the food options. You may be surprised how much of a foodie town Las Vegas is, well beyond the Strip. This last trip, we went to Babycakes Cafe (@BabycakesCafeLV), which is about 20 minutes off the Strip. Their claim-to- fame is pancakes inspired by popular cupcake flavors -- you know it was a must-try for Kim.  The pancakes were really good. They were light and fluffy but packed full of flavor. You can tell they put a lot of care into their pancakes and perfecting cupcake-like pancake batters. They had many flavors like lemon ricotta, peanut butter, strawberry and we had a hard time choosing. We decided to go with red velvet and carrot cake pancakes. Both were awesome and served with a cream cheese syrup. One suggestion for them, selfishly speaking, would be to create a pancake sampler to give customers an opportunity to try a variety of their flavors. We had to order two separate dishes just so we could taste more than one of their flavors.  In addition to cupcake pancakes and traditional breakfast menu items, they also have Filipino and Hawaiian-inspired dishes. I ordered Rick's adobo fried rice. This is a Filipino dish that includes shredded chicken adobo and fried rice, wrapped in egg.  It was nice to find a place that Kim and I can both enjoy. It lets her justify eating cupcakes for breakfast and gives me an opportunity to eat dishes that I enjoyed when I lived in Hawaii. Moreover, it has a little bit of everything so you can satisfy a diverse group of people and palettes. The food was very good and we stuffed ourselves. They could work on their service a bit. They have a lot of teenagers working that don't have a lot of service experience - you have to ask for refills or flag them down when you want your check, but the food was awesome, so it's definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "If breakfast places had a hierarchy, then Babycakes is the ruler of them all!  They rule in the realm of salty and sweet. All other places bow down to the new cool kid on the block: Babycakes Cafe!  Easy enough to find in the Northeast corner of Buffalo and Smoke Ranch, there was not one moment where I was not impressed. The ladies serving were all incredibly sweet and service was top notch.   The Salty: -  The fiance ordered corned beef hash and eggs which comes with crispy nuggets of happiness (hash browns).  The corned beef hash had the reminiscent lingering taste of childhood memories associated with the canned deliciousness that is corned beef hash.  mmmmm comforting canned food....   -  Chicken Adobo Fried Rice.  Anyone who's had chicken adobo knows that it is one bomb filipino dish.  Add that into fried rice, even better!  Wrap that into a fluffy egg wrap.  Mind blowing!  The fried rice inside consisted of shredded flavorful adobo chicken and super greasy (not a bad thing in my mind).  Add a touch of siracha, I fell in love at the first bite.  The Sweet: -  Red Velvet Pancakes.  Holy moly baloney!  This is the best breakfast marriage ever!  Red velvet cake is awesome by itself, and making into pancake form kicks its deiiciousness to unbelievable levels!  The texture of the pancake itself had a very slight crispiness on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside.  Add in a healthy dollop of whipped cream and chocolate bits on top, I don't even think I needed to use the cream cheese syrup at all.  Sweet sweet pancake bliss......... mmmmm  Conclusion:  Babycakes, you are the ruler of my breakfast world.",

Never tried them before, but now I know how fluffy they are supposed to be. The omelette was also delicious. Although my wife didn't enjoy the crepe, I did; and we both agree that the sweet cream inside was outstanding.  Despite going on a weekday both times, we had to wait for approximately 15 minutes.

    "text": "What is the hype about this place?  Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, this place has about 6 regular tables and 6 bar tables that use high chairs.  I was going to order the chicken fried steak, but the server said it's frozen and then fried.  I asked about the corned beef hash being made scratch, but it's out of a can.  I asked if they make their biscuits from scratch and the server said \"I think so.\".  I was alarmed.  I went with the Kaluha pork eggs benedict with the seasoned potatoes.  Very disappointing. The potatoes are just deep fried potato cubes.  No bellpepper and onions.  The pork was smokey and just okay.  My sister had the loco moco. The gravy was bland.  The hamburger patties had a good flavor.  We also had a short stack of buttermilk cakes.  They were okay.  Nothing I would write home about.  140+ Yelpers averagin 4.5 stars really had me puzzled.  The food isn't made from scratch.  Frozen and canned just don't get me in that 4.5 star mood.  Spam is the only canned item I would accept only because you know it's canned.  Corned Beef Hash doesn't mean it's canned unless they say Hormel Corned Beef Hash.",

Visit any of their locations, they are all awesome. I'm going to let you in on the perfect BabyStacks breakfast:  Get either the 2 egg breakfast or the bacon and eggs breakfast if that's more your liking. Then, and heres where you need to pay attention, sub the regular rice for the garlic rice. It's a $1 upgrade, but it's the best $1 ever spent. Seriously, this rice is amazing. I make a version of it at home since I've moved to Denver. In my opinion, over medium eggs work best and they are amazing with the rice. Ok, toast or pancakes? PANCAKES! And here's the awesome part, you can sub your favorite BabyStacks flavor (again for an up-charge, but who cares, it's awesome). I suggest the Hazelnut, or Strawberry but most love the red velvet. Seriously, if you are even thinking about going, just do it. They have some amazing things on the menu to try.",

Yup just like I predicted, they were a huge fan.   I ordered the Kula Pic Eggs benedict. OMG it was amazing. It was so yummy. I would have never thought to mix these two together.   After telling my coworker it's a must to order their famous Red Velvet pancakes, I had to order on for myself. They fell in LOVE with them.   Customer service is always great when I come here. Sometimes the wait is long but, don't let that stop you cause trust me it will all be worth it.   I do love how BabyStacks do get involved in our community of Las Vegas.  I can't wait to come back!",

I've had the Portuguese sausage plate and it's delicious too.  I'm always tempted to try other pancakes but every single time I go here I only end up ordering the red velvet because I'm afraid I won't like any of the other ones as much and I'll miss out on this delicious creation.

Breakfast is solid, country Benedict is crave worthy, with a delicate biscuit that is oh so fresh. I really like the Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice, it's like an omelet filled with meaty chicken and yummy fried rice. Their homemade red and green salsa is not to be missed. Those. Pancakes. Though.

Service is friendly and quick, but once they give you your bill make sure you head to the front to cash out- the servers don't do that part.  KAHLUA PORK BENEDICT: Didn't care for the cabbage, found the pork itself a little bland, but somehow all the flavors together really made a great dish. Wish the potatoes had just a touch more seasoning, but they were perfectly crisp. HUNTINGTON SKILLET: Seasoned potatoes topped with over-easy eggs, bacon, cheese, pico de gallo, AND avocado?! It's a party in your mouth, no additional seasoning needed.  WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES: These are so sweet, you wont even need the syrup. Between the two of us, we couldn't even finish a short stack they were so sugary. Didn't detect any macadamia flavor or crunch, though. GARLIC RICE: Love how fragrant this dish is! Smelled it cooking and had to have some, definitely tempted to upgrade to the adobo fried rice next visit.  The thing that really amazed me was that none of the food we received was unnecessarily greasy, a common issue with breakfast/diner food. If you want to come here, better to go early (before 10) or wait til lunch- the place really cleared out by 11:30AM. Really liked the friendly island-style service, want to come back for the Kahlua grilled cheese.",

The gravy is really good. Better than the other restaurant that I'd tried. But the s'mores pancake is not what I expected. Just like a plain pancake nothing special. It's just have marshmallows toppings.  The Price: It's very affordable. Not too pricy. For my order, Loco Moco with the side of 2pcs of pancakes. It's like $11.   Gonna come back for their Loco Moco. And gonna try their other pancakes.",

My boyfriend and I come here so often that the servers feel like family and they give us hugs every time or ask us how we're doing. Which I think is very sweet.   But I'm reviewing today deducting one star because of the very slow service I received today. My friends and I came here after class to just have a quick brunch. But we ended up having a 2 hour brunch because of the wait times for our seat and our food. I've been here too many times to know that this place is small (about 13 tables total) and there is usually a wait to be seated. Today we were sat down after 15 minutes of waiting (which isn't bad) and then right when we sat down the busser gave us our drinks. The downside was waiting for our food. I felt like we waited for our food for about 40 minutes, which didn't feel like the usual serving time that babystacks had. I would say it might be because the kitchen was backed up, but I have seen this place more packed and I have gotten my food way sooner. When we got our food we were finally ready to eat, but my pancakes are missing and my server told me it will be right out. But it literally has been about 30 more minutes, my friends have eaten all their food and my pancakes are nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, I'm just observing the other tables get all their food already. Finally I get it, but I didn't really have an appetite for it anymore... it would have been nice if I was accommodated some way, but I was still charged for the pancake that was pretty much irrelevant my entire dining experience today.    P.s. Our usual servers weren't there. They're usually much more efficient.",

    "text": "Long time listener, first time caller; I'm careful to fall in love but the pancakes at Babystacks really sweep me off my feet. The short stack portion is satisfying and won't run you for more than $6 maximum. I've always felt welcomed by the service here as well.  Hazelnut Pancakes- Gentle but mandatory suggestion: order these with strawberries. 9 out of 10 doctors agree that Nutella is good on its own, but it's proven to be incredible when paired with buttermilk pancakes. I'm certain the dollop of whipped cream brings everything together and negates the need for syrup.  S'mores Pancakes- These have something akin to Golden Grahams cereal in the whipped cream topping, which gives you something to crunch on. The bits of melty chocolate and mini marshmallows do the whole s'mores thing justice. I'm a fan.  Banana Cream Pie Pancakes- Not only do you get some slices of banana in the whipped cream garnish, but there's slices of bananas in the pancakes as well! The banana cream sauce is something like banana pudding. Really, you won't be disappointed by these if you're already a fan of the namesake dessert.",

This place is not that big, so I can see a wait being an issue if it was busy and if you were a party over 4 there is really only one table that you can be sat at. We ordered S'mores, Cinnamon pancakes and Spinach Benedict with fruit. Everything was delicious. Service is excellent. I like how you just pay at the register. Great pancake place. I am actually sad that it is a 30 minute drive for me.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were in town during President's Week and ventured off to find a good breakfast/brunch restaurant in the LV area. He's dined at this restaurant before and vouched that their pancakes are delicious, and I read reviews on Yelp that their red velvet pancakes with a cream cheese sauce on the side is their signature pancake dish.  We arrived on a Thursday morning. There was a 30 minute wait, but that was a good sign to me that this place is popular with the locals. We were seated in the time frame that they promised, and the server greeted us warmly.  The menu had many entrees, of course, and many of them pertained to pancake entrees. However, I noticed that they had an extensive option of Hawaiian based breakfast dishes (loco moco,fried rice, etc). I wanted to stick to a smaller breakfast since I had a large dinner on the previous day. We stuck to their pancake entrees.  He ordered pancakes with infused bacon bits (odd combo I know), and mine was the red velvet pancakes. We both ordered the half order of three pancakes instead of full.  Of course, I can't live without ordering home fries to balance my palette off with something salty. Plus, I just love potatoes -- carb addict, I know. My boyfriend recommended the potato chips, and I went with his recommendation.  When the red velvet pancakes arrived, the taste was on point. Every bite was simply amazing. They were fluffy, warm, and perfectly sweet. The cream cheese side complimented the dish beautifully. Not to mention, the whipped cream with chocolate flakes on top of the pancakes were a nice addition. Loved the dish.  The potato chips, on the other hand, were very oily and greasy. They were drenched in vegetable oil -- just gross. I didn't enjoy them at all. Very disappointing! I should've opted for the home fries.  When we went to pay our bill, their computer system was down, so some of the diners were left waiting. They were polite about it, and the short wait didn't bother us. They still managed to get their credit card system working, at least.   I would definitely return when I'm in the area, but I'd rather get my potato fix elsewhere.",

    "text": "Visited Babycakes after purchasing their groupon offer.  My favorite breakfast place is Egg Works so they had a lot to live up to. The verdict? Thumbs down.   The eggs benedict was terrible. It was overcooked and hollandaise sauce was bleh. Seemed like maybe it was made from a powder mix? It was definitely missing something. The seasoned potatoes were okay but salty for my taste.  Also ordered an omelet that had veggies and a variety of meats. Once again, lack luster. I felt I could have made it at home and for the price, it was smaller in proportion to what Egg Works serves. The hash browns that were on my plate were probably the best thing but once again, small in portion.  We also ordered a small stack of plain buttermilk pancakes. This was probably the best thing we ate at our table.  Although I wanted to like Babycakes because of their cute logo and reviews, I must sadly say that I will probably never be eating breakfast here again.",

Don't get me wrong, the food was stupendous.The skillets are amazing and the red velvet pancakes are heaven on earth, just wish the cafe was a little bit bigger.

    "text": "I'm sorry but I don't get the hype about this place. I read the yelp reviews and got excited because it's close to where I live and I've been looking for a really great and convenient breakfast spot... but after my two experiences here, I will never go back. Even if it was across the street from my house and offered free breakfast, I would never ever go back. It is that disgusting.   How do you mess up any egg dish? That blows my mind. I had a denver omelet and it was mostly egg, hardly any cheese or peppers, and just had maybe 10 ity-bity bits of ham. Other than the loud-mouthed waitress who had no manners, what I noticed the most from this visit were the cheap crappy plates and tableware. Never seen anything so cheap in any restaurant ever in my life. I felt dirty using them.  On the second visit (yes, I stupidly gave it a second shot), I had steak and rice, and both were absolutely inedible. HOW DO YOU F UP RICE?!! The rice was hard and dry. The steak was like the meat I would imagine you would get in prison. It was tiny, round, and charred to the point where all you could taste is charcoal. The meat was so hard that the cheap flimsy fork wouldn't penetrate it.   But that's not the disgusting part.   I reached for the steak sauce so I could try to choke this charred crap down and nearly dropped the bottle. The bottle looked like it's been used and refilled for at least five years without being cleaned in any way. The opening of the bottle was so clogged with nasty, crusty old sauce, I'm sure the sauce that was left in there would only trickle out. Not that I wanted to use it after seeing that. Then I reach for my straw to drink the nasty water and the straw was stained with what looked like blood O_O. I quickly dropped that too, completely appalled. I waved the waitress down to get another straw, and she grabs another from her dirty apron and throws it on the table and guess what?... it's stained and crusty looking too!   At that point I decide I'm done. I didn't eat, didn't drink and I just wanted to run out of there as fast as I could. I grabbed my stuff and paid and got the hell out of there. I didn't raise hell or demand to speak to a manager because... how do you tell someone everything about their establishment is repulsive and they should be shut-down. I'd be embarrassed to even have to say that to a place of business. They should be ashamed. Yelpers beware.",

We ordered the red velvet, banana cream pie, and strawberry pancakes and they were all delicious.  My personal fave was the banana cream pie.  All the pancakes were served with homemade whipped cream and the red velvet came with a cream cheese syrup (YUM!!).

For one we had never heard of a place having red velvet pancakes.. second it is a locals place. a little hole in the wall and thats exactly what we were lookin' for.  Was easy to find. Heard about waits, but we got there around 11am-ish and got seated right away. I can understand some peoples complaints about waiting because there isnt much seating. But then again, when its a small owned business that serves good food, a wait is expected.  The service was good. Lady was friendly and helpful with menu. I ordered something boring [eggs, bacon, regular pancakes]. Didnt want to go over board since i was pregnant and still had morning sickness. My food was good. The hubby ordered the loco moco and bacon pancakes. He raved that the pancakes were delish, but said the loco moco should have had more rice.   Overall was good and we shall come here again :)",

Gosh, Im not one to wait an hour, Party of 7, food was a not that great, should have when to I hop, gravy was poor with no taste. the rice omelet that I got excited about horrible and only one of our party had any thing good to say. Hostess was rude , but waiter was trying but after we had our order messed up.... Yelp was wrong, after reading similarity stories about flavor profile and wait, its just not going to happen again, good waiting for a meal thats not that good!",

They reminded me of Hawaii. The wait was less than ten minutes for us. I, personally, ordered the adobo fried rice and red velvet pancakes and boy, were they delish. Starting with the adobo fried rice, you can definitely share this with another person. It was very big but that's the way it should be and the meat was season perfect. It was to die for that I wanted to bring it back to the hotel with me except we didn't have a microwave. Now, the red velvet pancake. Oh man, I devour that thing. From the whipped cream to the cream cheese sauce, there was nothing left on the plate. Highly recommended.",

It is always busy and by always, I mean always. I have never been here where I didn't have to wait for more than 30 mins. Service definitely incorporates that aloha spirit. Food never disappoints from their red velvet pancakes, to their kalua pig eggs benedict and corn beef hash and eggs. My mouth is drooling just talking about it. Prices are overly reasonable. If you get a typical breakfast like their steak and eggs, you get a choice of pancakes or toast. PANCAKES!?!? as a side?!?! That's AMAZING! They have two locations on separate sides of town so you can stop by no matter where you're at. Mahalo and enjoy the grindz.",

Way better than the other place down the street, in my opinion.  I'll tell ya' only if you ask.  Jacob stay awesome!  You've got the smiley service.  Thanks for keeping my hot coffee topped off.  We got our beverages within a couple minutes of being seated.  After ordering, food didn't take longer than 10 minutes to be served.  Wow the menu!  Can we order everything please?  Except we'll be extremely food baby'd...  Had us giggling about why we can't order 2 nutella crepes which would've been perfect.  Nooo sawwy chawlie it's one or three.  Yummyyyy :D all that's missing is ice cream!  Get it!  Approving and recommending their Hawaiian (spam) and / or Spinach (has mushrooms) Benedict plates.  Comes with two, plus potatoes served different styles.  Dousing the Cholula!  NOM-awesome!  The English muffins under the ingredients were not soggy oil sponges at all.  Loved that they were still fluffy with a slight crisp :)  They got it right!   Babystacks has a great menu, appetizing food presentation, good prices, clean dining area, great customer service, music and TV.  Billing receipt presents tip suggestions between 15% to 20%.  We have nothing to complain about.  You've made part of our day!",

The portions are great, the service is always friendly for how busy it gets. And yes, depending on the time/day you'll have a wait time. Just make sure everyone from the party is there or else they won't seat you.  Since the restaurant itself is small, it can get pretty noisy.

Babystacks is worth the wait.   As for food, my favorite dish to order was always the corned beef hash. The corned beef hash is GOOD! Everything else was ok.

Going right into it, I enjoyed the Mexican Omelette which had jalapenos thrown into it and served with seasoned potatoes on the side. 7  White Chocolate Macadamia stacks w/ cream cheese sauce were outstanding. 10! Steak and Eggs didnt seem to impress me at all. Hash browns had no flavor and eggs were bland as well. As for the steak, it was juicy but had to throw some A1 to get the flavor i wanted. 6 I did digg their Hawaiian jams that came on every so often though. I guess you can say, it set the mood.   Make sure you hit up this joint! Its more than worth it to stop by with their prices. If it wasnt for the orgasmic tasting pancakes,  i believe they would be a 3 star restaurant.",

Once we were seated we were greeted by Danielle and she took our drink orders right away. She was super sweet, always had a smile on her face, and made us all feel so comfortable. She answered a few questions about the menu and didn't get annoyed when I asked her if she had tried the German chocolate pancakes before and if so, would she recommend them? She said they were yummy although she doesn't like chocolate cake herself (I'm the same way lol)... She was attentive the whole time. Refilled the drinks when needed to and asked us if there was anything else we needed. Overall, the food was yummy and the service by Danielle was even greater.",

Red Velvet Pancakes: so good and not just because it's sweet, but because the sweet is a delicious one. It's that white cream sauce on top, better than any syrup could ever imagine, a gourmet cupcake kind of delectable in the simplest vanilla cream. I can definitely understand the hype with this dish. If not for taste, it's in the sizing. I could not finish off the huge saucers on my own.   Eggs Benedict: well, it's what you'd expect, it's great and a nice portion.   Adobo Fried Rice Omelette: I would go back for this dish. I liked it that much and it's worthy to note that I normally don't care for adobo at all. Being from Hawaii, pork or chicken adobo, especially filipino adobo, is everywhere, but not on my radar. This, however, could've changed my life growing up.",

We were seated right away (I mean, it was 7am so...obviously it wasn't very crowded). Took our orders right away and they were also ready quickly.  Both times I've been, I got a \"skillet,\" which is a type of meat and combination of veggies and cheese on top of some country potatoes with 2 eggs any style on top. I know this place is named after its pancakes, but honestly, if I don't have some none-carbohydrate food in the morning, I get hungry again 20 minutes later. 20 pancakes? Hungry in 20 minutes. 20 pancakes and 1 egg? Hungry in...many hours. I had the carnitas skillet (delicious) and some sort of chicken skillet (very good) and was very pleased with those decisions.  Over 20 flavors of pancakes make this your toughest decision of the morning. I think pretty much any way you go, you'll get something delicious. I've had the PB & banana and the plain banana and both were fantastic; my older sis raved over the chocolate mint chip 'cakes as well. Anything you're into, they put in a pancake here, and they'll sub in flavored pancakes for the plain ones to any skillet or omelet meal. Definitely do that.  Highly recommend, the earlier in the morning you can go the better! Can't wait for my next trip here!",

Adobo Fried Rice and Red Velvet pancakes are my go-to, can never go wrong with these two dishes.   Adobo Fried Rice-- the egg wrapping the fried rice like a burrito is cooked perfectly, texture-wise. It isn't salty, lacks a little bit of salt in my option, BUT the fried rice itself is so rich you won't need the extra salt. The fried rice is flavorful AND moist, which is a lot of Asian fried rice lack almost always. The potatoes I ordered was seasoned well --  had a little kick. I believe it had cayenne or paprika.   Red Velvet pancakes-- I ordered the short stack which was plenty for me. It came with seemingly homemade whipped cream. It was light and tasted very good. It also came with cream cheese syrup -- it was quite thick and sweet, so instead of pouring it all over my pancakes, I just dipped in it every bite I took. The dish was garnished with some chocolate powder and some chunks.  Banana cream pie pancakes-- I didn't have these my last visit but I remember it being creamy and tasted amazing! And I'm not really a big fan of bananas.   Breakfast burrito-- my girlfriend had this dish. She was very satisfied with it and said it was filling. She could barely finish the last few bites.   SERVICE- Very welcoming and genuinely nice.   Would always come back when I'm in town/State!",

We went super early on a Sunday morning to beat the crowd/line and sure enough there was no wait at all and we got to pick our table. I was so torn between crepes or pancakes, so settled on the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which reminded me of a slightly thicker Swedish Pancake with more tart flavor from the citrus. I also got a side of bacon because, protein. House coffee was very good as well. My friends got skillets and omelettes, and the bacon pancakes (cue Jake from Adventure Time! Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes, take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake, bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make, bacon pancaaake!). Everything looked so good, and from what I had, pretty darn good stuff. I will be back, Babystacks.",

Our server was kind and checked in on us every once in awhile to see if everything was okay. It didn't take too long for the food to come out either for a place that was busy. Sadly I was on a budget that day so all I got were nutella crepes. Since it was my first time trying crepes I wasn't sure if there suppose to be cold? I still want to come back and try the other foods on the menu. One day I will!  Food can be pricey but that's basically like any other restaurant/cafe out there. If you love a sweet breakfast, this place has a lot of options for you! The staff is friendly as well so that's a bonus!  Only negative things I have to say about this place is that the tables are very close to one another. Almost as if I was eating with the family next to me haha. And the tables were too small. If there was more room/space in general, that would be great.",

The omelettes, pancakes, and adobo fried rice is yum. I recommend the Cookie Butter French Toast and garlic fried rice, if anything. Service is prompt, but cramped inside.",

    "text": "Red Velvet Pancakes! That's what got me to want to try Babystacks Cafe, and I was not disappointed! They are absolutely the BEST! Just the right thickness, a little crisp on the edges, soft, tasty and most importantly not too sweet. The Cream Cheese Syrup, fresh Whipped Cream and bits of chocolate crumbles top the order off perfectly. I am salivating just thinking bout them!  We've been there a bunch of times and there is usually a wait, anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour no matter what day of the week you go. The second location at Buffalo and Flamingo is larger and sometimes you can walk right in there, we go there on occasion but still prefer the charm of the original locale. The servers are always friendly and even when the place is packed the food comes out quickly and piping hot.   I've tried a plethora of the pancakes, but I keep going back to the Red Velvet! My second fav would the the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, sweet, tasty and done to perfection. The Smores, Rocky Road and Bacon are all good as well. The Carrot Cakes, however, had a good flavor, but were a bit dry .. maybe an off day for whomever made them?   Babystacks also offers a full menu of different breakfast and lunch type items for those who are not craving pancakes. The Biscuits and Gravy are delicious and we usually get an order to share. That way we have sweet AND savory for breakkie. The gravy is flavorful and they give plenty of it. Sooooo good! A friend of mine had the Mexican Omelet which he said was perfectly done and just the right amount of spices and heat.   This is definitely a place I would recommend .. the prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, the service is great. The only thing I would say is that it's not really set up for larger parties as it's quite small. If you are wanting to do something for more than 6 people, you may want to take it to the Buffalo / Flamingo location.",

The server rudely told me, \"you can't eat that you aren't under 12\". When I told her I was 12 she laughed at me and wouldn't serve me. I have never had a server refuse to give me the kids menu. I'm paying so I should be able to order what I want? So I had to order something else and I got the bacon pancakes. They sucked, extremely mediocre. So dry and even when I drenched it in syrup they still had no flavor. Literally the pancakes out of the box are better. The server was rude and the pancakes were terrible. I would give it zero stars but I have to at least give one in order to post this. Never coming back. I don't recommend this to anyone. Sad to say that IHOP is better",

We were easy customers who ordered immediately & left quickly. The only request I had was for a take-out box, & my male server must have forgotten. I wish I could have given them 5 stars. The only other reason was because there were a few little ants on our table and walll, which our table leaned up against. My boyfriend & I tolerated it & didn't mention it.

If you eat that thing with no icing, theres no taste.   Anyways, on to the positive aspects. The place is nice and homely filled with welcoming services and a great variety of choices (especially for those asian/filipino people and their type of breakfast with rice and spam.. etc).  I ordered a crunchy whole grain french toast and i must say i was very surprised how good it was! it seems very simple, a french toast covered in crunchy corn flakes, but it was so yummy and good looking, the people next to me ordered it too and loved it! My boyfriend got an veggie omlete and the red velvet pancakes as the side so we can both try. Overall this place was good but I wouldn't drive all the way across town to come eat again, sorry!",

It was a Thursday, mid-morning, and we were greeted right away by a woman who sat us. She was very nice. I ordered the \"homemade\" corn beef hash & eggs & I got the red velvet pancakes. The red velvet pancakes are divine. If you like red velvet, you'll love these. I've had lots of RV pancakes & these are by far the best. The corn beef has looked like a cube of dog food. I've had corn beef hash a lot & this wasn't that great, neither were the eggs which were a strange color. The hash browns were undercooked & bland. My boyfriend got the Mexican skillet which also looked underwhelming & wasn't that great, according to him & he is an authentic Mexican. Haha. The portions were small & it was expensive. The reason I'm giving it 3 out of five stars is for their pancakes, which they're famous for, and our excellent service. Our server (I wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shoutout) was amazing. She was happy, friendly, and very attentive. The service from everyone I saw was amazing. I'll go back again for sure.",

Also tried the adobo fried rice, which could easily be mistaken for an omelete. The stuff is actually wrapped in egg. Ridonk. I ordered the Kalua Pork Benedict and patted myself on the back as soon as I took the first bite. I already love eggs Benedict, but that dish made me love it even more.

First off, there was a 30 min wait to be seated but despite this, we decided to wait it out so we can have a taste of Babycakes dining. The inside looked pretty cozy but nothing spectacular.  Once seated, we ordered coffee and was served some along with nasty looking cream. By nasty, I mean there were brown stuff crusted on the half and halfs.   I decided to order Rick's Adobo Fried Rice since I like adobo and I like fried rice and was curious what it tasted like as an omelette dish. The others I were with ordered banana pancakes and the piglet omelette.   The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time but sadly, they were a disappointment. Maybe because of all the hype, I really wanted to like Babycakes. But the food was pretty bland and a bit overpriced comparable to other breakfast joints like iHop or Blueberry Hill, both which are much better food-wise and price-wise.  Don't think will be returning here anytime soon.",

    "text": "My family of four (two adults two kids) went for Sunday brunch and really enjoyed it!  Don't let the sad shape of the mall it is located in fool you. The atmosphere is really nice, the staff friendly, and most importantly, the pancakes are spectacular!  We ordered two short stacks (3 plate sized pancakes). The kids ordered s'more cakes which had marshmallow pieces cooked into the cake and topped w chocolate shavings and golden grahams. Rave reviews from the younger set.   Dad and I split the red velvet pancakes. WOW!  These were spectacular. They were moist and fluffy, with a cream cheese topping. Some of the best pancakes I've ever eaten.   Portions are HUGE!  We split 2 short stacks and one side order of bacon between 4 people and had leftovers.   Saw some wonderful omlets go by. May have to try one next time. Or the bacon filled pancake. Or the peanut butter pancake.  Bottom line is we will be back for more!",

We waited an hour for a table, yes the place is small, but when I see emply tables and servers staff around talking, you have to agree that the wait is not warranted. The flavors of the pancakes are quite interesting and we liked the ideas when reading the menu, but the pancakes were a little thin, dry and tough - I think a fluffy pancake is worth talking about. I will admit the cream cheese syrup was totally tasty! Call yourself BabyCakes and the Cakes should be amazing. We wouldn't go again, I can make better pancakes at home.",

First the girl told me it would be a 20 min wait for a table when there was only one party ahead of us with 3 ppl. I peaked in the dining room and here were 2 empty two seater tables. When we were sat a couple minutes later I found service A bit slow. I ordered the spinach Benedict and my husband got the French toast.  The Spinach Benedict was HORRIBLE! It had this strange cheese wiz all Over it. I asked the waiter if that was the hollandaise sauce and he said it was and I could change it if I wanted to for another item on the menu. I said I just scrap it off. Half my plate was this thick cheese wiz like sauce.  My husbands French toasts was good but cold!!! And the syrup the brought us was cold too!!!  We will never go back there and I can't understand where all these good reviews came from... If I thought it was a Bad day I would give it a second chance but sadly I think they just suck",

This last time I showed up with my father and my 10 month old son. We asked for a table for 3 plus baby. They would not sit us or even acknowledge that we were there. My sister and I live across the street in Desert Shores but my sister could not find her keys. They said we can not sit you until everyone is present. My son was starting to get fussy because we are not sitting him down. They sat 8 other tables by the time we waited. So I asked if we could please be sited the girl at the front said it was a 30 minute wait. I have been wanting to eat there 4 times needles to say they are not friendly. They did not care that 3 out of the 4 were there and by the time we were walking out not even a bye. I say I rather go to the cracked egg because I can at least be treated as with respect and to be acknowledged, and to top it of I can have breakfast with my family.   Shame on you Baby Stacks that's 2 less households you will not have as costumers. And believe me I will tell everyone I know if the horrible experience at your establishment.",

    "text": "Best breakfast place in Vegas by far.  I am a big fan of breakfast.  Egg and I and Original House of Pancakes are good, but the menus there get old with the same old stuff.  At Babycakes, there are so many nontraditional items on the menu.   My girlfriend ordered a short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes.  I don't like red velvet cake, but I loved these pancakes.  They are not too sweet, so the sweet cream cheese syrup tastes perfect with them.  They are also served with homemade whipped cream.  I had a short stack of the S'mores pancakes.  While they were delicious, I'm not sure if the menu description matched what I got.  It says that it has marshmellow and chocolate cooked into the batter.  However, it's basically just two plain pancakes with a little marshmellow in between.  There was graham cracker and chocolate sprinkled on top that added the S'mores flavor.  It was good, but I think they could make it better by mixing chocolate into the batter.  S'mores is supposed to have melted chocolate anyway.  I also had the portuguese sausage and eggs which was good.    Service was great here.  When we came in, it took awhile for the hostess to take our name and she ended up taking down a party that came in after us before us.  But it was no big deal.  The wait time was not that bad.   I will come back here again and again to try more of the menu items.  I already bought 3 of the groupons.",

    "text": "Baby Stacks is a very cute breakfast joint that reminds me of grandma's kitchen. Unlike other chains of breakfast restaurants such as IHOP or Denny's, Baby Stacks definitely has an aura of individuality, making it a fantastic ma and pop hideaway. You can almost be certain the recipes are original and as homemade as it can get . With it's homey country style decor and easy, laid back ambiance of staff (all servers are casually dressed in jeans and a t-shirt), this place is definitely the spot to go to for breakfast and a newspaper.. or brunch dates with a few close friends.   Definite Recommendations:  RED VELVET PANCAKES *Signature dish*  (short stack $5.75/ full $8.95).  Before trying these pancakes, I was never a fan of red velvet cakes because they were always too sweet for me. However, these pancakes were amazingly balanced in taste that it blew my mind away. It's served with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles along with the most delicious cream cheese syrup. The pancakes itself is fluffy to the taste and sweeter than your traditional buttermilk pancakes. (In this case, the sweetness comes from the pancake rather than the syrup we're so used to in regular pancakes).  The best part about this dish is definitely their cream cheese syrup. The creamy cheesy flavor of the syrup extremely compliments the sweetness of the pancakes, balancing it out, making ever bite the perfect combination of sweet, with a hint of salt and richness. Words cannot describe how amazing this dish is so definitely try it for yourself!  KULUA PIG BENEDICT ($9.75) The Kulua Pig Benedict is an English muffin layered with Hawaiian style slow-cooked shredded cabbage and pork, poached eggs and topped with hollandaise sauce. This dish definitely kicks the traditional Benedict to the next level. The Kulua pig taste so tender and juicy with just the right amount of saltiness that goes well with the muffin and sauce. You can get this dish with a side of seasoned potatoes that are delicious with or without ketchup/ sauce.  I always get this when I'm in the mood for something light that I know can fill me up right away and then easy to take home later to eat again. Because this dish comes with 2 Benedicts, it makes portioning the meal perfectly, and definitely something I recommend if you want to split with someone else.  CORA'S CORNED BEEF HASH AND EGGS ($10.95) Now I know corned beef hash is a very common dish that can be purchased anywhere. There's really only so much you can do with corn beef, however, the corn beef at Baby Stacks has a very fresh flavor that definitely separates it from the canned corned beef you find in the stores. The flavors definite taste homemade, with a delicious garlic flavor that follows every bite. The dish comes with 2 eggs and a choice of either buttermilk pancakes, hash browns, seasoned potatoes or steamed rice ( you can always upgrade ).. My suggestion is to upgrade to their garlic rice *drools*.. It's simply rice that is fried in garlic and onions, enhancing the flavors of the beef to the next level. With Tabasco and ketchup on the side, this dish is definitely my favorite dish of all time.",

My boyfriend and I split the red velvet pancakes and the specialty eggs benedict. I credit this place for introducing me to eggs benedict. I've always wanted to try them and never had until now. So. So. So. Good :)  There were tons of great sounding dishes on the menu but we had to choose something. If I ever make it back to town again, I look forward to diving into some of the other yum yums.

We were told that we had to wait in the 10+ line to be seated. I'm really sorry but this is not how you treat a potential customer.

    "text": "Believe the hype on the pancakes!! Worth the 5 mile drive away from the strip for brunch. The wait for 4 was said to be about 45 minutes, but the quick service and efficiency of the kitchen kept the crowd moving and we only waited probably 20 min max. I ordered the banana cream pie pancakes and they were amazing!! Bananas baked into the fluffy pancakes and covered with the thickest, creamiest, and best tasting whipped cream I've ever had. I wish I could have taken that stuff home; it was so good! On my hierarchy of breakfast treats, pancakes land in 3rd behind french toast and waffles, however BabyStacks definitely won me over with these pancakes. Also had a bite of the red velvet (bomb with the cream cheese syrup) and the strawberry (freshest strawberries and hella whipped cream) as well as fries and the garlic fried rice. That fried rice was legit. Definitely on my must visit list when I'm in the area.",

    "text": "If not for the desert mountains surrounding me, I would have thought I was back on vacation in Kapaa.  I'm sensing a recurring theme here, with Hawaiian food in the desert.  I'm not mad about it.  I'm just jealous, that's all.  There was about a 20 minute wait at 10am on a Friday.  This place was packed!  That didn't change during our whole meal, people eat, people leave, more people sit and more people eat.  I think we got here at the right time, because it seemed like the people who came after we got seated had a longer wait time.  This isn't a big place, maybe one day, they'll expand.  Anyways.....  I've been terrible at deciding lately, but I suppose it's just a Vegas thing.  Too much looks good, and there's not enough space in my body.  I was torn between the Spam scramble with rice and mac salad, and the Ricks adobo fried rice omelet....What to choose?!?  Lucky for me, my mother-in-law ordered the adobo fried rice, and I was able to get the Spam scramble, but I changed out my white rice for garlic fried rice, of course!    So the Spam gets diced and thrown in with eggs and cooked on the flattop, and left a teensy bit runny, and while that would have been just gravy, they went and sprinkled Furikake on it!  It kinda seems to lift everything it gets put on, that Furikake.  Next time, I'm going to put it on my frozen yogurt and make it 10x better.  The only thing that kind of turned me off to my breakfast was my rice, because the garlic and onion were both slightly raw.  Is that a Hawaiian thing?  I've just never had it that way, and when I cook, I make the garlic kind of crispy and dice and saute the onions so they're less noticeable, , but it wasn't that bad due to my LOVE of garlic and onion, even if it was a bit undercooked.  The Mac salad, al dente noodles with subtle flavored dressing, I don't know anyone that LURVES mac salad, I certainly don't hate it.  I hate half because I was saving room for....wait for it......  Adobo fried rice omelet!    I'm from that school of eating that loves to cut their food up into little pieces, mix it all together and eat it with a spoon, and adobo and rice?  Certainly falls into the category of foods that take well to being mangled like that.  I just wish it was Pork Adobo instead of chicken.  But I suppose if I'm going to gain a pound a day every time I'm in Vegas, I should do it healthier right?    The adobo fried rice omelet, so wrong yet so right!  Soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, shredded meat and rice all wrapped up in egg and sprinkled with green onions?  Done improperly, this could be about the worst garbage ass omelet in the history of man, but in the magic hands of the chef at Baby Stacks, it turns into a culinary masterpiece!  Just don't be afraid to destroy the art, it can't stay beautiful forever.    Good coffee, great food, a bit on the small side, but a great place to start your day.  Just don't forget to get portuguese sausage like I did.  I guess I have another reason to make my way back to BabyStacks.",

I would suggest having one area for groups if any.  Our wait turned out to be over an hour! I watched several people walk in and back out.  I will say the food is very good!

So the bf and I drive about 35 minutes to get to this place, wait about 45 minutes to get seated, order our food and about 15 minutes later they bring out my food and it was wrong..TWICE. Okay, it's not that big of a deal and honestly I wasn't even really that mad because the wait staff was really friendly and it wasn't really their fault. I ordered their spinach Benedict (no bacon) and of course it comes out w/ bacon. Okay, no biggie they bring it back out and the eggs are WAY overdone, like literally hard boiled. Okay, let's try again. They bring it out again and its done perfectly. Their hollandaise sauce was actually REALLY good but by this point my boyfriend was already done eating and after all the waiting I wasn't even that hungry. Their potatoes were not that great at all either.   My bf did share his red velevet cakes with me and those were deliciouso. Overall, it was a miss for us but if we happen to be on that side of town for some reason, we might give them another shot. The place is really cute and I think we might have a better experience the second time around. Just not really worth driving across town for.   Sorry babycakes..you're super cute but just not that amazing!",

I heard all about the Red Velvet Pancakes so that is what I ordered. BabyCakes also has tons of other types of pancakes too. Smore's, Banana and Bacon just to name a few.   I also ordered the Huntington omelet which come with bacon, cheese, avocado and pico de gallo. This thing was huge and delicious.    The service here is great too.   Overall 4 stars. I am taking away a star because the ambiance seemed a little plain. If you disagree, try Sabrina's Cafe in the Italian Market in Philadelphia.",

I went with the Kalua Pork Benedict and it was surprisingly good.  Kalua pork is usually super salty, but B-Stacks' wasn't.  not bad at all.

The waiter said that the green chile sauce is the spicier of the two, but I think next time I'll go with the red sauce. I got hash browns with my meal, which were AMAZING!! Really, some of the best hash browns I've had.   My girlfriend ordered the red velvet pancakes. She enjoyed them quite a bit. I'm not much of a cake person, but they were pretty good. It was like eating cake for breakfast - which is something I always looked forward to as a kid after a birthday party. I couldn't see myself eating a whole meal, but the few bites I had sure were tasty.   We also ordered the adobo fried rice with the intention of taking it to go. We didn't realize that it was an omelette with fried rice in it. We apparently didn't read the menu very well since it says that it's adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg. I guess I just assumed that most fried rice has egg bits in it and didn't think that it would be an omelette. Pretty interesting take on fried rice. It was pretty good, too. It didn't really have much of the adobo flavor I'm used to, but I liked it.   Overall, Babystacks is good. The service was great and the staff members were very friendly.  I've been wanting to try it for a while now and I'm glad I did. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I've been here 3 more times since my last review.  Here's what I've tried so far:  I love the spinach benedict.  I'm not sure if it's because spinach and mushrooms are one of my favorite vegetables, but I really enjoy this dish.  The spinach is perfectly cooked the way I like it.  I hate it when restaurants overcook vegetables and it's mushy.  I also like the cripsy bacon in between.  The english muffin is lightly toasted and not hard like some places I've had before.  I'm not a fan of the kalua pig benedict, but it might be that I normally don't like pork as much as beef or chicken.  I won't say it's not good but it lacked a little favor and the only thing I've had here that I won't order again.  The honey toast is really good too.  I love the thickness of the bread.  It's simple but delicious.  It's so hard to decide what to eat here because I like so many things and want to try everything, so usually I would order a savory meal and something sweet like this as a dessert.  I know I'm such a pig :-P  Who eats dessert after breakfast/lunch??  I've also had the sweet cream crepes with bananas, which is a nice dessert.  They have honey on the side, but it's pretty sweet as it is.  My boyfriend ordered steak and eggs which I've had a bite of.  I thought it was a really good deal.  It came with 2 eggs, potatoes, 2 pancakes, and an 8 oz steak.  The steak was really tender, but my boyfriend said it lacked flavor.  All he needed was to sprinkled some salt and A1 sauce (which was provided along with 2 different hot sauces and ketchup at the beginning of the meal) and it was all good.  It was cooked medium like he requested, still pink on the inside.  Other than the food, I've never had to wait for more than 15 min for a table but I usually go during the weekdays or past 12 on weekends.  The service has always been good for us.",

I actually didnt like the pancakes they had a weird bitter taste to the batter and the banana flavor tasted artificial. I had the lemon ricotta before and didn't care much for those either. 1 star for coffee. Worst cup of coffee I've had in years. The awesome waitress brought me a fresh cup and it was still disgusting. How can you be a breakfast place and have gross coffee?",

I think the idea for this cafe is great because it's a mix of Filipino, Hawaiian and American breakfasts. All they need is chicken and waffles and it's the perfect brunch place!  The first time, I ordered the chicken adobo fried rice and it was awesome. For those who don't know what chicken adobo is, it's a very popular Filipino dish. It's basically chicken cooked with soy sauce and vinegar. My friend ordered the red velvet pancakes and those were amazing! They taste as good as they look!  The second time I went, I had the spam scramble, which was pretty good. Nothing too special though. My friend ordered the Loco Moco, and we both had the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes! Again, the pancakes were great!  The place does get crowded because it's not that big so expect a long wait especially on the weekends.",

    "text": "The wait here is pretty long, unless you have a party of two.  My party of three probably waited at least 30 minutes.  It kinda sucked bc we'd see parties of two arrive way after us but get seated right away.  :(  It's not their fault that they have many more two-person tables, but it was still irritating.    Anyway, once we were finally seated, we ordered pretty quickly.  You get a side of buttermilk pancakes with most orders (a stack of two) and can pay a small fee to upgrade to a flavored one.  I think they should offer an option to get one pancake bc I saw a lot of people leave a ton of leftovers due to the amount of food.  I got the Chili Omelet, which had Zippy's Chili (my favorite from Hawaii!) on top and inside.  Though there was Zippy's Chili inside, I wish they put more on top.  It was pretty basic - just an omelet filled with Zippy's!  Good but not great.  The has browns were really good, though, as they were crispy and not soggy.  I also upgraded to the Red Velvet pancakes, which came with a deliciously sweet whipped cream (they must make it there bc it def did not taste like the canned kind), chocolate bits, and cream cheese sauce on the side.  The cream cheese sauce was super sweet, but I liked it, though the whipped cream was probably enough.  Pancakes were light and fluffy and really good.  My friends got the chili verde omelet, which she found to be very average, and my other friend got spam and eggs.  I can fry spam myself at home, so I never order it out, but she had a craving for it.  One friend got a side of buttermilk pancakes, which she said was good.  Food came quickly, and we ate just as quickly since another line was building up.  The place had a constant flow of people coming in.  I can see why, though.  I'd definitely eat here again, even though it's a bit of a trip off the strip!",

I'd say no if you have more than 6 in your party as it's not cramped, but not huge either.   I got the cinnabun shortstack pancakes (3 cakes) and a side of the Portuguese sausage. The pancakes had crushed pecans, a dusting of sugar and cinnamon and a drizzle of icing. They were so good I only needed syrup for the bottom pancake that missed out on some topping. That's saying a lot, as I love my syrup! The sausage is a link cut on the bias, and has a great smoky flavor. Think of it as a kielbasa with more savory touches. I also got to eat some of the bacon too, and it is high quality, with plenty of flavor; not just the usual salty fat of most bacon.   I'd come back again.",

Very tasty with the cream cheese filling, but the crepes themselves were a little chewy. Crepes should be light and crispy.  I had an ice tea which tasted like water, with virtually no tea flavor. Not good.   Service is always good, looks like the same crew of waitresses as my last two visits so they keep staff around which makes for consistency in service.

I've been to Baby Stacks a ton of times and it's this specific location that happens to be my favorite. Then I realize, my visits were all before I started Yelping.    BabyStacks use to be a staple for breakfast before I moved out here.  The restaurant is small and can get crowded, but once you're seated be prepared for a breakfast treat worth bragging about.  I'm not embarassaed to admit, there was a time I was here weekly.  From service to their food, you cannot go wrong with this place.    -Red Velvet Pancakes:  This is what they are known for and if you haven't tried it, it's a must.  Review the photos and tell me you can't resist.    -White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes:  This is actually my favorite stack here. Imagine eating your favorite Macadamia nut cookie transformed to a fluffy pancake.   -Garlic Rice:  My favorite dangerous dish all time.  The rice looks plain, but it's so good and melts in your mouth.  Who describes rice to melt in your mouth? I do, that's who.  This another suggestion.  -Adobo Fried Rice:  One of my newer favorites here.  Not as big as say Aloha's Kitchen, but I think it's better in taste.  A healthy serving of rice and chicken Adobo wrapped in an egg omelet.    -Loco Moco:  Hit and miss with their Loco Moco's.  Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's just okay.  I think it's maybe due to the fact I think Hawaiian BBQ makes the best Loco Moco.    -The Others:  Then you got the traditional stuff that will not disappoint like eggs, sausage, their Portuguese sausage.  Their Portuguese sausage is also very good.  If you're visiting Vegas, BabyStacks is sure to be one of your highlights.  After you've tried BabyStacks, you will not be impressed with the others out there.  Trust me on this one.",

That said, this was our first time at Babystacks. Two people ordering a fairly standard breakfast... $30. Breakfast doesn't cost  $30. For $30 I expect a life experience. We ordered eggs, sausage links, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, and potatoes between the two of us. My scrambled eggs were over done. I don't expect my eggs to be crispy. The sausage was greasy... to be expected of links... but all but flavorless. The biscuits and gravy were interesting. Buttery or cheesey.. not sure.. but also kind of sweet. I didn't finish them... I walked in starving and I love breakfast food.. didn't finish.   Restaurant was still very full and seems to get reviewed well. I just don't understand the attraction. What's it cost.. maybe a nickel to make a pancake! $30! I'll pay too much for good food, but I'd put this place in par with a Denny's. Nothing special.",

The first time I visited this place, it was really packed so we did take-out.  The second time I came here, we were lucky enough to get a seat after waiting a few minutes.  My friend loves it because it reminds her of Hawaii and she gets to eat her favorite portuguese sausages.  I LOVE that they have a variety of choices for pancakes!  After eating the tiramisu pancakes, I had the worst cravings for it.  It got so bad that for several months after, I was looking up recipes on how to make tiramisu pancakes...which turned out NOTHING like the ones here. I enjoy the omelettes that they serve here, and can see why there's always a long wait for this restaurant.  If I'm back in Vegas, I'm heading back here for my pancakes!",

This is one of those restaurants where it really doesn't matter what you choose, everything on the menu is equally delicious. Even if you're not too big on pancakes, you're gonna love these. Unique flavor combinations and the fluffiest stacks you've ever tasted. Short stack or full stack if you're really hungry, topped with whatever your little heart desires. Bananas Foster are my favorite. Red Velvet are also a big hit. Also, I'd skip the skillets if you like your potatoes crispy (I know I do).  But when I'm not in the mood for pancakes I opt for the Portuguese Sausage & Egg Whites and Seasoned Potatoes or The Huntington (a bacon omelet topped with avocado served with a side of pico). Other notable mentions: Spam and Eggs with Garlic Fried Rice, Adobo Fried Rice & Portuguese Fried Rice. Rice, Rice Baby! Lol.   Tips:  Lots of parking, but this is a smaller location. Come early of you don't want to get stuck waiting on the sunny bench. They won't seat your party until everyone has arrived.",

The only downside was that the inside was pretty cramped, but that's not their fault. The Spam Scramble (scrambled eggs, spam, rice, and furikake seasoning) was packed with fluffy eggs and a generous amount of spam. I was afraid it would be too salty, but it was perfectly seasoned. My favorite dish was my bf's Adobo Fried Rice. The portion is humongous. It's delicious fried rice wrapped in an egg. Definitely try this one if anything! I also got the short red velvet pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy, and the strawberries were fresh and sweet. I wish they had a pancake sampler or something like that..I would have loved to try the other flavors. I would come here again for the Adobo Fried Rice and the other pancakes!",

I ordered the Hawaiian staple Loco Moco. They had it with garlic rice for an additional charge as well as spam. Since the last place I had Loco Moco in the area (see review of Kapuna Cafe) did not have spam in the rice I ordered the garlic rice with spam. I didn't realize until it arrived that what they did was substitute the spam for the hamburger. So I got this plate which did not look appealing as you can tell from the photo with a little gravy and spam covered rice. The rice itself was salty the gravy was salty so you can imagine how it was when you added spam into the mix. At least the eggs will cooked right. Also the side of coffee and enfused chocolate pancakes were tasty.  I was really hoping they would knock it out of the park with their food unfortunately that was not the case. In fact half of my wife's dish went to our dog.",

    "text": "First off, I love our waitress Danielle. She was so accommodating with a high energy personality.  Danielle was very friendly, fast paced and always looked out for our needs without us having to wait. She even threw in a free mac salad on the side which was also accommodating. My friend and I were very pleased with her service!   My friend and I ordered the Chili Moco, Lolo's Adobo Fried Rice,  Buttermilk Pancakes and the Red Velvet Pancakes. The prices were moderately inexpensive and they were big portioned plates. I had to take my food to go, along with my pancakes because this was very filling and delicious.   I also ordered another Red Velvet shirt stacks to go and she definitely hooked us up! I got three stacks of pancakes with extra extra cream and syrup on the side! Way to go! It was very satisfying.   I only had one dislike about an item and it was the macaroni salad. I know we just got it on the house, but i just wanted to bring up the critique of the food. It was very watery so the flavor was pulled out of the macaroni salad which made it taste flat. If it was a little more dryer, I would definitely hold up its texture and flavor next time.",

I got read the reviews about how busy it is on the weekends, so I decided to call in my order. When I got there, there weren't many people so 8am on a Sunday seems good if you don't want to wait.  The red velvet pancakes are just okay. Almost like a dense piece of red velvet cake. The RVPs I had from IHOP are just as good. I also had bacon, eggs and hash browns, which were pretty standards. I did sneak a bite of the macadamia nut pancakes. They were amazing. Way better than the red velvet!   If I am ever in the neighborhood I'll go again if the wait isn't too bad and I will just stick with a stack of the macadamia nut pancakes. It's definitely not worth going out of your way.",

Because  friends recommended the place and warned us about the wait, we were expecting it, so I can't complain.   Staff was super friendly and the food came quick. We were checked on numerous times throughout the meal for refills on coffee and water.   I had the carrot cake pancakes on the side which were the bomb. I will definitely be back. I really want to explore the Filipino side of the breakfast menu on my next visit, and will probably try a different kind of pancake every time.   I am docking one star because my omelet didn't have very much filling in it. It was supposed to have sausage and bacon, but it was kind of sparse; almost mixed into the eggs in very small pieces.",

    "text": "Hello. My name is Melanie, and I am a pancake addict.  Awe, why so serious? Being addicted to pancakes isn't so bad. I mean, so long as I don't let it get out of control. It's not like I eat pancakes for dinner...regularly. And I totally don't own pancake batter in a spray-can form. And I DEFINITELY have never argued with a McDonald's clerk because they wouldn't serve me a Hotcakes 'n Sausage platter a measly five minutes after breakfast ended. Never.  Okay, you got me. I may be fibbing a little. The truth is that I have a hard time saying no to pancakes. I could be wish-I-wore-my-stretchy-pants full, and if a warm stack of fluffy flapjacks somehow landed on my table - well, let's just say I wouldn't let it go to waste.  And so you can imagine what a pancake cafe would be like for me. Tummy temptation at its finest! Babystacks boasts the most ridiculously extensive selection of pancakes I have ever had the pleasure of choosing from. Red Velvet...Cinnabun...White Chocolate Macadamia Nut...Rocky Road - their pancake list reads more like a dessert menu! For those who seek savory over sweet? BACON pancakes! And even a Honey Whole Wheat option for the carb-conscious.   The best part? Each is available as a short stack of three pancakes. Translation? You can order like THREE different kinds without busting your pancake bank!  I played it cool and ordered just two flavors - the PB & Banana and the Red Velvet.  The PB & Banana was definitely the frontrunner of the two, with banana as the perfect complement to the unmistakably peanut-buttery batter. Simple, yet such a mouth-pleaser! The Red Velvet did quite well in its pancake debut, served with a delightful 'cream cheese syrup.' Though I would have done without the chocolate crumble topping -- it was an unnecessary distraction from the decadent-on-its-own batter.   Bottom Line:  The perfect place for feeding your flapjack fetish! Short-stacks are your best bet for maximum pancake sampling. Beware the long wait for a table -- especially on weekends.",

Not orgianized, service was less than average, my server I think needed a good night sleep, maybe out too late the night before... the wait time was unexceptable.  Now on to the food.... overpriced breakfast with below average food.  Maybe it was an off day but it was my first visit and I think it will take me ...never to come back.  Cold eggs, soggy toast and all without a smile.",

BabyStacks is a good place to sit back, enjoy a cup of coffee for luch and slam as many Red Velvet Pancakes in your mouth until you reach your limit!  All the rave about these heavenly cakes live up to its reviewers 4-5 star rating.  The Red Velvet Cakes were accompanied with cream chese syrup, choco chips and whip.  The other dishes we ordered on the menu were no comparison to IHOP and Denny's.  Eggs Benedict w Kaluhua Pig and Chicken Adobo Omelet just to name a couple.  The place is quite small and the wait can be quite long which is the only downside.  Otherwise.. Onolicious Brah!",

The deliciously moist, fluffy pancakes come in a wide range of flavors you'll recognize from childhood, such as smores, red velvet, and pb&j. I can't wait to try them all! Also worth a mention is the other items on the menu. They don't get the starring role that the pancakes do, of course, but they certainly round things out if you're not feeling like sweets. The eggs Benedict were very tasty, with the Canadian bacon having that nice smoky flavor that lets you know it's actually bacon, and not ham like so many other restaurants.  Prices are reasonable and the service is fairly flawless, though perhaps a bit more serious than I'm used to at a local breakfast joint.  I highly recommend this place for breakfast and brunch!!",

    "text": "NOT YOUR TYPICAL BREAKFAST or LUNCH CAFE...  Because we had a huge party of 8 people we were able to order FAMILY STYLE and just pick from an amazing variety of dishes from Babycakes Cafe's delectables!  =P Below is my description of the following items...  -**Red Velvet Pancakes -**Cinnamon Bun Pancakes -Country Fried Steak & Eggs -**Kalua Pigs Benedict -**Honey Toast -**Wheat French Toast -Rick's Adobe Fried Rice   (I added an \"**\" by the items that I've never had before and were special.)  So let me just describe how our meal went down...  From the light texture of the Red Velvet p-cakes and the full and savory flavor of the airy homemade whipped cream (Never had anything like it! I don't like whipped cream, but I really like this one...A LOT!)  that accompanied it, to the special of the month (at the time that I went June 2011) - Cinnamon Bun Pancakes (Whoa!), HOMEY Country Fried Steak and Eggs, the Kalua Pig Benedict (which was my FAVORITE!!!! If you like the smokey flavor, then get this! I've had salmon eggs benedict before, but the flavor of this thing just BURSTS forth like no other.) We also got the Honey Toast AND the Wheat French Toast. Both HIGHLY recommended. If you LOVE HONEY then get the Honey Toast, and if you really love cinnamon and the whipped cream from here AND a crunchy texture, get the Wheat French Toast. See, the Wheat French toast had \"cereal bits\" built into the bread that added an extra level of crunchiness, yum yum! Rick's Adobe Fried Rice was also on our table and was devoured within a few minutes.  These are just some of the things we ordered which were definitely NOT your typical breakfast/lunch items (except country fried steak and eggs). If Babycakes Cafe were located in my neighborhood back home I'd definitely be a regular. =D",

The service was busy, but yet somehow the servers always came to check on our table at the right time. The food selections are wonderful. Many include breakfast plates. Their portions are huge! If your hungry get the Mexican food plate with tortillas which comes with chicken, rice and beans. I came hungry, but after leaving not only was I happy with the service, price and food, but I was full! My portion was more than tasty enough food. Enough to feed two! I recommend next time you want some good tasty breakfast, but not from a big food chain eatery come to this place it's excellent! You won't be disappointed!",

If its your first time, please don't get turned off by the wait as you will not regret it. Breakfast was the kalua Benedict, adobo fried rice, and their special cookies n creme pancakes. As others have stated try all the other pancakes before thw red velvet because those are the best in my opinion!  As usual it was busy but service was great, staff is friendly, and the food arrived in a very decent amount time given how much people were there. The kalua Benedict is great! Smokey, savory kalua pig with hollandaise sauce and potatoes. The potatoes are awesome crisp and tender with great flavor. The kalua Benedict is definitely a must. Then the adobo fried rice.... just greatness wrapped up with an omelette! ! The adobo is nice and salty but not to much with the mac salad on the side this is winner and is highly recommended to try for your first time. The pancakes were a great surprise!! Chocolate pancakes were light but dense, I know weird but True! With cookie bits and an awesome syrup these pancakes was mean!! If they are still on the menu try these and then order a side of red velvet pancakes lol! I think there is nothing that will disappoint at Baby Stacks!! Definitely a must try place when coming to vegas! But I live here so I can anytime, chee!",

The setting looked alright very simple and clean. It gives you a warm Hawaiian feel because I am from the island of Oahu myself.   The menu listed my favorite: CHILI MOCO and also some local favorites in there as well. I believe that I would rate the chili MOCO a 7 out of 10 because the plate looked too big for the portion. I think that there should be more flavor in the meat and provided a bigger portion of food.  Overall it was great but I would have wanted the portion a little bigger.",

First of, it's a small, cozy venue.  Greeted really nicely.  Reasonably priced.  We could not decide on the flavors of pancakes so we had 3 short stacks: banana cream pie, red velvet, and bacon pancakes. Plus we had a side order of the Portuguese sausage.  Everything was delicious.  My husband loves the red velvet.  It was not super sweet, just perfect favors. Enjoy!!",

Looking forward to trying to make my own version at home.The pancakes are of course the real reason to come! Hubby upgraded the side to Red Velvet Pancakes for an extra $2 and loved them.  I got the Lemon Ricotta pancakes ($8) and they were delicious. I added a side of strawberries and whipped cream ($2.50) to go with them and they really made the lemon flavor pop.

It's nice to have steamed white rice available to switch up with their potato options. The array of pancake options from smores to red velvet to banana fosters makes it impossible to choose your favorite because they're all delicious! Also the servers are excellent, they are patient with our kids and always check back on you so your drinks are top off and you're not left chasing for service. I do know this is a physical constraint with the size of the overall place, but think wisely when you're going there during a breakfast rush. The front of house always quotes an extremely long wait time, but due to the in and out, high traffic, you never know if it's actually going to be 10 minutes or longer. Also the seating is not comfortable during the rush as the tabletops are small and limited seating.",

Out of the three specialty pancakes ordered--red velvet, white chocolate, hazelnut--the latter, hazelnut was ah-mazing! Would definitely come back for stacks of those deliciousness! Red velvet was moist but was too sweet for my buds, next time I don't think I'll slather the cream cheese.

I got the strawberries and cream pancakes with the cream cheese syrup instead of the strawberry syrup it usually comes with. The pancakes were slightly chewy and on the thinner side, which is actually how I prefer them.   My boyfriend got the corned beef hash and eggs, which did not come out at all the way he was expecting. Normally corned beef looks like shredded beef, but this looked more like ground beef. He also said that his rice was hard. For the price, we were expecting the portions to be a little more generous; it didn't seem like that was the case for all dishes, though.   Not anything amazing, but good for breakfast/ brunch if you're in the area.",

You could see it written all over the menu - rice, portuguese sausage, spam, kalua pig -- I even saw adobo fried rice!  But what they specialize in here are their pancakes. Not a huge pancake fan (I don't mind them as sides but not as a full meal), I wasn't sure what to do. I ended up with one of their skillets. It is potatoes on the bottom with you eggs and whatever else you chose on top. It's not technically in a skillet though. Each skillet (and most other main entrees) come with a short stack of pancakes. You can upgrade to any of their \"fancy\" pancakes too (they must have over 20 types!). Being near the holidays they had chocolate peppermint pancakes so I went with that (one of my fav flavor combos).   The skillet was good but the pancakes even better. Ok, they almost tasted like cupcakes so maybe that's why they were so yum!  I hear the lines can get long so go during an off hour or expect to wait. Ample parking in the parking lot in front (free).  I wish they would bring Baby Stacks to Hawaii!!!",

My favorite stack is this cinnamon bun ones, although I've tried several others and was not disappointed. The pancakes can be a little overly sweet, but definitely a treat. Every location I've tried had been consistent with flavors and service. I love their attitudes. Everyone treats you like you're family and that's my favorite kind of service.

Being from hawaii, it's hard to find good food from back at home that hasn't lost its taste along the way. Our server was Jacob, who was the sweetest & very helpful!   Pancakes: White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut- overall it was alight,but it did get tough after a couple of minutes. Wished there was a special sauce to go with it but that's just my preference.  Rocky Road - probably the best pancake we had on the table, it was soft, chocolatey & the marshmallow cream scoop on top made it even better!  Orange Dreamsicle- tastes exactly what it sounds like, cream and orange.   Food:   Kalua Pig Benedict w/no cabbage. It was overall good, but I'm a Benedict fanatic and found that the hollandaise seemed like it was missing something (maybe some citrus?) I couldn't put my finger on what it was. The Kalua pig itself was ono! Not tough, moist and flavorful. Kalbi & Rice- the kalbi was marinated well and the flavors were there. The rice was a little hard like it didn't have enough water when cooking so it wasn't as moist as I'm used to but non the less, it was good! Huntington Omelette- good, liked that the pico was on the side!  Side of Portuguese Sausage- it wasn't what I was expecting, it tasted more like a link Sausage than a regular Portuguese sausage. I'm used to Redondo, Hawaiian style brand or Gouveas but something about this one didn't taste like what I'm used to.   Overall the experience was good, the food was good for somewhere that offers local hawaii food in the mainland & id come here again.",

I love breakfast for lunch and/or dinner :)  So we got there closer to closing time (2pm on weekdays) because nobody vacationing in Vegas gets up earlier than noon (well, definitely not me!) so we beat the morning congestion and were seated promptly. I guess we got lucky because I've read that the wait can get pretty bad.  I ordered the red velvet pancakes and my sweetheart ordered the s'mores pancakes. DAMN! Both were sooo good. The red velvet pancakes were like eating perfectly flattened cupcakes smeared with cream cheese syrup and whipped cream! Each bite melted in my mouth... perfection!    The service was great too! My coffee cup was always filled and we didn't wait too long for our food to come out. Also, they were very accommodating and  even though we showed up closer to closing time, they didn't rush us at all which I appreciated very much.   Definitely a must-try especially if you're visiting from out of town. Yeah, so it's located on the other side of town from the strip but it's definitely worth the drive!",

    "text": "I wish there was a place like this in So Cal!  My husband and I were in Vegas and on the way to Death Valley.  We wanted to find a GOOD breakfast spot that wasn't a buffet or touristy place on the strip.  We found this place on Yelp and were lured in by the red velvet pancakes and eggs benedicts.  We got there at about 10:30 am on a Friday morning and waited about 20 minutes for a table. I noticed that the menu and the music (island reggae) in the restaurant has a Hawaiian theme.  I saw Kahlua pig and Loco Moco on the menu - and they're particularly Hawaiian food.   I ordered the Kahlua pig eggs benedict, and my husband ordered the country benedict.  We ordered a half stack of red velvet pancakes, which ended up arriving a bit before our two plates.    I'm actually not a big fan of pancakes, but I ate those pancakes like a starved person!  I loved that they were soft and moist and tasted like what I hoped red velvet pancakes would taste like - and not like I was eating a overly sweet cake like I was afraid I might be.  But like red velvet cake or cupcakes, it's more about the soft and moist texture along with what makes the cake - the cream cheese frosting.  The cream cheese frosting/syrup wasn't too sweet and pour out on the pancakes about the consistency of ranch salad dressing.  The little chocolate chips sprinkled on top were definitely made the pancakes irresistible.   As for the Kahlua benedict, they were good but not great.  When in Hawaii, Kahlua pig is one of my favorite things to eat.  Even living in So Cal, I've never found any Hawaiian place that has ever done Kahlua pig the way it's done in Hawaii.  Carnitas at some authentic Mexican restaurants are probably the closest, but still not the same. I was a bit disappointed with my benedicts since they also had a lot of cabbage in them, giving the Kahlua pig a slight bitter taste rather than the juicy pig taste I was hoping for.  The Kahlua pig tasted pretty bland otherwise, and was a bit soggy rather than meaty like I hoped.  As for my husband's country benedict, it tasted I guess as it should - like country fried steak with eggs.  As for the hash browns (I didn't wanna risk ordering the potatoes, since I've rarely found a restaurant that did breakfast potatoes well), they were perfect. It was fried to a perfect crispiness on one side and moist and potatoey on the inside.  These were probably some of the best hash browns I've ever had!  Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would definitely make the 20 min trip off the strip to go there again next time I'm in Vegas. I'm certain a breakfast place like this would do really well in So Cal. :)",

I've tried biscuits and gravy, Kahlua pig Benedict, a turkey sandwich, corned beef and hash, fried rice & of course the infamous red velvet pancakes. It's not that it didn't taste good it was just that nothing stood out. Nothing was amazing or 5 star worthy, just your standard diner tasting food. I love the concept of the place and the little fusion thing going on. But to be honest I prefer breakfast at The Egg and I or Blueberry Hill..",

My dish was delivered about 10-15 minutes later, just before everyone in our party of 5 finished eating.  I opted for the bacon pancakes.

    "text": "When Babycakes Cafe first opened in October, we were invited to join the Husband's cousins in experiencing this new breakfast joint.  Unfortunately, we couldn't make it out that morning but heard raving reviews from them and soon after, it was blowing up on Yelp!  It's been on our radar since, and when a groupon for Babycakes showed up, we scooped up on this coupon!  Yesterday was the big day - most importantly, we wanted to avoid the weekend rush.  Reviews about an hour long wait weren't something we were interested in, and luckily, it was only a ten minute wait for our party of three on a Wednesday around noon.  We decided to share three items that were unique to Babycakes Cafe than other breakfast joints in town.  * Red Velvet Pancakes \"Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles.  Served with cream cheese syrup.\" (Full stack $7.95, Short stack $5.25) - First off, I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes and it's not my first choice in breakfast.  But hands down, these pancakes are REALLY good.  They aren't too fluffy or thick.  The sweetness is just perfection and sweetness from the cocoa, whipped cream, and syrup all add to this yummy cake.  I was sold and would definitely reorder this over and over again.  We went for the full stack to share, which was a very smart choice!   * Kalua Pig Benedict \"A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, English muffin.  Topped with our delicious hollandaise sauce.\" ($9.75) - The Husband and Truc N. were loving this dish.  As Truc was saying, he doesn't really like pork all that much but he really enjoyed their version.  They both complimented on how moist the meat was and enjoyed the savoriness.  The accompanying potatoes could use a something something though.   * Rick's Adobo Fried Rice \"A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions.\" ($8.50) - This was the downfall of our breakfast.  It was a huge scrambled egg concoction with the fried rice mixture inside.  I was the first to split it open and there was a weird smell that came from it.  And then the taste, I wasn't quite getting it and wasn't sure if this was how it was supposed to taste.  When the Husband got into it, he ultimately said their burned it - the rice, the meat, just everything inside.  I'm still not sure if it was intentional to have the 'burnt' taste or not, but all of us were not impressed with it.  Not something we recommend.  Overall, they have some unique items that make them stand out - specifically the first two items we ordered and additional things like Honey French Toast, S'more Pancakes, Bacon Pancakes, seasonal items like Pumpkin Pancakes and Macadamia Nut Pancakes.  Service - it did take awhile for our food to come out.  And I can only imagine how much longer the wait may be on weekends after you get seated.  And yes, there is more than just the food here, the view is quite nice too for the men.  I don't recommend coming with a large group as it's a small restaurant and there isn't that much room for large groups.",

Based on the familiar items of SPAM, Portuguese Sausage, and other island style dishes....I'm guessing that the owners are from the Pacific Islands.  I ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes (Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup. $5.25), which are 3 Pancakes about 8 inches in diameter each.....and a side order of Portuguese Sausage.  Mom ordered the Jalapeno Burger ($8.75).  The food came out in short order and I eagerly started on my Red Velvet Pancakes......they were freakin' AWESOME!  Wow, I was blown away with the Sweet, Soft, Velvety flavor and texture.  I should have ordered a full order dammit.  I then took a few bites of the Portuguese Sausage.....it was disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the flavor of it at all and it didn't taste like the Portuguese Sausage I was accustomed to eating when I'm in Hawaii.  Bummer.  Mom couldn't finish her Jalapeno Burger, so she gave me a few bites.  I thought it was OK, nothing special.  Certainly not worth $8.75.  Our server was friendly and on top of things.  Overall, a nice breakfast experience.  Will I return?  Those Red Velvet Pancakes are calling me.....",

Simply, just go for the main dishes... which I did as well.  The omelets were flavorful, but their take on whole wheat french toast was unexpected.  I really wanted some soft and succulent french toast, but when I was presented with 3 pieces of hard fried looking bread, I was surprised.  I'd skip that dish.   If I were here again, I'd probably go for the pancakes like everyone else does.  I was just hoping that all the other dishes were good as well.  Also, be prepared for a short wait when you check in.",

    "text": "YUMMY! On our mission to try as many \"Yelp\" favorite restaurants we can, we of course had to stop by Babycakes Cafe. Babycakes had been blowing up on Yelp recently for their Red Velvet pancakes and Kahlua Pig Eggs Benedict. So, off we went...  At first site of the red velvet pancakes, my sweet bud sensors went off. ALARM- this may be way to sweet to eat! I was afraid, I was petrified. The beautiful red pancakes covered in chocolate pieces and whip cream with a side of cream cheese icing look....sweet. I WAS SURPRISED! The pancakes were not overly sweet at all. They were sooooo tasty. The cakes were rich tasting, almost like a cake. The icing was smooth and creamy and perfectly accented the cakes. YUM!  We also had the Kahlua pig benedict as well. It was pretty good too. I found the Kahlua pig to be a big to oniony but my boyfriend loved it .  Overall a great place to have breakfast / brunch. TIPS - we went on a Thursday and completely missed the over 1 hour wait on the weekends. This place is small and there is not a lot of seats so make sure to go early!  This Baby has her new favorite cakes - at Babycakes :)",

    "text": "It seems like they changed their name from BabyCakes to BabyStacks, I guess to emphasize their pancakes... We were a party of 3 that waited about 30 mins when we arrived at noon.   I ordered ham and eggs with hash browns and s'mores pancakes. My mom ordered eggs with seasoned potatoes and regular pancakes and my sister ordered the red velvet pancakes. My over-easy eggs were made to perfection, 3 nice strips of ham steak was grilled and not overly salty, hash browns were ok - ketchup had to give it a boost and my s'mores pancakes were disappointing.  I was expecting something that was going to make my tastes buds happy and go \"mmmmmmm\" like how a s'more usually does... but that moment did not come.  My mom's seasoned potatoes had no flavor.  My sister's red velvet pancakes were a big flop; it was super bright in color (too much food coloring) and very lacking in flavor, if I was blindfolded, I would not have thought it was red velvet.  I guess I'm a little spoiled with red velvet pancakes from Cinnamon's out in Kailua, Hawaii - which is melt in your mouth chocolate heaven!  I really wanted to like this place but it's just all hype - I'll wait until I go back to O'ahu to get some real red velvet pancakes, I'm going to bring my sister next time she's there so she will know what I'm talkin' about.",

It has so much flavor and the carnitas are properly cooked. The skillets come with pancakes so my kids always have something to eat without having to order their own meal (they are 1 and 3 and can't eat a huge portion).   The prices are reasonable especially for how fresh and consistent the food is.  The only reason I took away a star is because the wait time is always so long!!! They definitely need a bigger location to accommodate their business!",

From what I saw, most of the items on the menu are your typical breakfast/brunch items: eggs, bacon, crepes, etc. I'm sure they're all cooked great BUT I really encourage you to get the menu items that make this restaurant unique! It seems that a very popular choice is Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Yup, thats: fried rice lathered in chicken adobo sauce and chicken, wrapped in an egg omelette - making it look like a burrito. It is indeed very good, and that's an endorsement coming from a Pinoy. For those not too familiar with Filipino food, the rice/chicken part WILL be salty, so if you're not in to salty foods, this may not be for you.  Despite being a big fan of that dish, my family members around me got it so I just picked off their plates. I myself got the Kalua Benedict with country potatoes. What makes the benedict special is its shredded pork. The pork is so tender and moist, its a unique substitution from what you typically have on benedicts.  My dad and uncle both got the Loco Moco, and although I didn't get to taste it, they both gave their endorsements. We all ordered nutella crepes, and that plate is very large! We were able to split it among 6 peoples as a perfect dessert.  What a gem! Mahal na mahal kita!",

Sat down and looked at a crazy cool selection of items. Different skillets, eggs Benedict options and staple egg dishes. Flipped the menu and the fun jumped to the \"sweet\" section. Pancakes, crepes, and French toast dishes.  Told my waitress that I was STRONGLY recommended by the hotel concierge to eat there. As I will do often I asked her what her favorite thing to eat was and she led me to the KALUA PIG BENEDICT (Yes...I was yelling it just then) and it was amazing. Shredded pork was awesome. Hollandaise sauce was velvety smooth with a perfect balance of acid and cream.  I also ordered a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes...don't judge me I walked 7 miles earlier.  Here's the deal...she could have given me the full short stack and charged me the 5.95 for the short stack but instead informed me of the option to go with pancakes over potatoes for only 1.50 instead!  That's service. These pancakes were amazing. Sweet, buttery, and the sweet cream icing...only used a bit but it was delicious!  Las Vegas...you gotta check out BABYSTACKS Breakfast and Lunch Cafe!!!",

HOWEVER if it's 30 minutes before closing, the restaurant is practically empty, and the people who are present are willing to order for those coming in 5min or so, you'd think they'd sit the party instead of having them wait outside in the heat.  Food: got two of their signature items (red velvet pancakes and Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice). Both were just ok. The fried rice was a little too salty while, as a huge red velvet cake fan, I was a little disappointed by the pancakes (though the cream cheese \"frosting\" was good). Also tried my sister's baby chick skillet and again, just ok. Not sure why this is on best breakfast lists ...",

Finally went to Babycakes this past Friday :D My friend/high school classmate was visiting from Florida so I wanted to take him to a yummy breakfast spot! I've been wanting to try Babycakes for the last 2 months and have been waiting for someone to visit me in town so I could experience Babycakes with someone else. I didn't realize that Babycakes is 8 miles north of me... but it was worth the drive!  Came in around 10am... no wait. We both ordered the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice... I got the red velvet pancakes and my friend got the white chocolate chip mac nut pancakes. Both pancakes were delicious and you can't go wrong with the local favorite portuguese sausage eggs and rice.  I would love to come back again... when more friends visit me in town again.   Pay your bill at the counter. casual dining. stress free parking. good customer service.  If you're visiting Vegas or a local... make Babycakes on your to eat list!  I'll be back for more!!!

    "text": "I've been a few times with the BF since my initial review and it's slowly crept up into a favorite breakfast spot for us.   Firstly, I'm a Filipino so any place that has steamed or garlic rice is cool by my standards. This is a cool inbetween middle of Hawaiian breakfast and American style breakfast that is similar to what we would have at home. It's the varied options that bumps this place for us. I cannot eat pancakes alone for breakfast as it just is too much, too sweet, so it never seems worth it for us to get a full order at many places and they don't do short stacks of flavored ones. Here, many of the breakfast come with a option of a \"babystack\" (2 pancakes) and you can upgrade it to the many gourmet flavors for just $1.50 more. That amount with a savory breakfast seems perfect and costwise is great to get breakfast AND the flavored pancakes for under $10. Most places we would have to basically order pancakes as our third entree plate and that's usually too much to eat without others sharing.  I tend to favor their omelettes, as they are pretty fluffy and a good size or I let my Filipino all hang out and get a simple breakfast eggs and sausage type plate with rice.  Our go-to pancake flavor is the lemon ricotta. This one is a bit more crepe or german pancake like and is just very light in flavor. Lemon flavored sweets is a new thing for me, and this place definitely has helped convert me We normally get another rich flavor to contrast. However, the chocolately type pancakes here are not overly saccharine and dense. We had a almond joy flavor recently off their specials and it was fluffy, and just deliciously balanced. Nothing richly sweet like the chocolate bars. Chocolate pancakes is one of my least favorite kinds, but theirs is highly enjoyable for me. I've had their famous red velvet before, and honestly, every other flavor I've had surpassed that one so don't be afraid to delve out of the box.   Service has been pretty decent of a range of acceptable to great. It's always at least friendly consistently. We go during the afternoon mostly, so it's never been a wait but is busy. I'm not sure if this place is packed with a waiting during usual breakfast hours on weekends, but I imagine so. If you don't like waits, well breakfast at breakfast time is maybe not a good thing to do.  I have yet to try some of the specialties like the kahlua benedict, but mostly because I have trouble thinking about coming here and not getting a pancake. They sound great though that it just might be worth it! In fact, I think I may go this weekend again. I've been on a big breakfast kick lately since we've been waking up early.",

There is often a wait, even during the week, but it's never too long. The place isn't huge but it's so worth the wait. I always get the Kalua pig Benedict and last time I went I swapped out the English muffins for Hawaiian sweet rolls and that was one of the best decisions of my life. Seriously tasty. All them pancakes are good, so it's their Portuguese sausage. We go often and love being regulars. A must go to place for off the strip breakfast. Love all the Hawaiian options here. My kids kids love the s'mores pancakes and the special pineapple pancakes are my fave when they have them available.",

    "text": "I finally came here with my boyfriend after trying to drag him here for about five months (it's just too out of the way for us). We went on a Tuesday morning and there was still a 40min wait, which sucked because we both get hangry (a hybrid of hungry and angry) fairly quickly. We just sat silently perusing through the menu and smelling the delicious scent of fresh cooked food until they finally called us up.  Since we already went through the menus, we threw in our food orders when the waitress asked for our drinks. We both ordered Spam and eggs with pancake sides. I got the Red Velvet and he got the banana. I believe both of our orders were over $11 because we got specialty pancakes and he upgraded to garlic fried rice. I felt that $8.95 for the Spam and eggs was a little pricey considering we got 3 pieces of Spam each and you could easily get about 10 slices of Spam from a can that's only $2.50. We really wanted a taste of home though, so we both got it.   I specifically told the waitress I wanted my Spam crispy, but they gave it to me soft and floppy anyway, so I only ended up eating one piece. My boyfriend ate all his Spam, but hardly touched his rice because it wasn't what he expected (it had a lot of thick long strips of onions all over). I guess we're both used to the Filipino style garlic rice we always get at places like Nanay Gloria which just has small pieces of chopped up garlic and that's it. Having both chopped up garlic AND large strips of onions is just a recipe for halitosis.   On to the pancakes...  My Red Velvet pancakes were nice and moist. Even after piling on all the whipped cream and cream cheese syrup, they weren't too sweet either. They were definitely good, but it was the first time I've ever tried Red Velvet pancakes and I wasn't very blown away. There are a few other places in Vegas that also serve Red Velvet pancakes, so it's not exclusive to BabyStacks.   My boyfriend thought his Banana pancakes were alright. Rather than adding mashed bananas to the batter, they just put 8 small slices on top of the pancakes and serve it with syrup, so it's actually pretty plain.  I guess I had very high expectations for this place due to all the outstanding reviews, so when I went I was a little disappointed. I mean, it's a good breakfast joint, but not something I'd be willing to wait almost an hour for after making the long commute.",

Friday morning we had a table of about 10 and waited almost an hour for a table, but it was so worth it!!  If you come with a big group, best go as early as possible!  Out of the dishes we ordered, I tasted: red velvet pancakes, adobo fried rice omelet, and the loco moco.  The pancakes were so much better than I expected them to be!  I'm really not a fan of pancakes but the red velvet ones were super delicious!  And they're not topped with butter; they're topped with a cream cheese syrup and chocolate chips.  Loco moco was really good and I absolutely loved the adobo fried rice.  Prolly gained 5lbs while eating there but I will def want to come back the next time I'm in Vegas",

The restaurant entrance could be a little less crowded if they removed those high chairs.... Being in a wheelchair it was difficult to get in the front door.

Free wifi internet was available. So I was able to hook up with my iPhone!! Yay!! Was helped immediately by a friendly waitress who got me Coffee.....STAT!! Being filipino I opted for the \"Ricks Adobo Rice Omelet\" .... The waitress said \"Is that it\"? and I asked if it was a small portion... She said NOPE!! Trying to watch my girlish figure I opted for the Omelet alone.... And pardon my french but it was FRICKEN HUGE!! hehehehe!! The rice and Adobo pork was cooked to perfection and the eggs nicely cooked. Yummy !! So scrumptious.   Will definitely come here again!! I'll even brave the weekend  crowd for this place.

I've had the bananas foster pancakes and the carrot cake ones and they are both fantastic. The bananas foster was really sweet. Surprised? Their bacon and eggs are also good. I can't recommend the coffee. It isn't terrible, but it tastes a lot like Folgers and it is my only real complaint about the place. I've had good service both times. Definitely recommend this place for a leisurely breakfast on a cheat day.",

We managed to get seated in the last table for two.  After us there was a wait.  The menu was fantastic!  Not only did they have the standard breakfast favorites of pancakes and eggs but they had garlic fried rice.  Ohhhhh...they had me at garlic.   I end up ordering the loco moco and was not disappointed.  Rice, hambuger and gravy...you can't go wrong with that!  The hubby ordered himself some garlic fried rice with corned beef.  You could smell the garlic before the plate even reached the table.  I love that!  We left there full and happy.",

Both places were good, but Babystacks was outstanding, with original offerings. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was huge, and perfectly seasoned -- really delicious and different. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The Almond Joy and Butterfinger pancakes were heavenly. Surprisingly, not too sweet. Red Velvet were also predictably good based on reviews.   Service was fantastic. Worth the wait, no question. Excellent value. Loved the fact that all breakfast combos allowed an upgrade to any specialty pancake for a modest charge. Loved it so much -- we will be back before we return to Orange County tomorrow!",

Go get some yummy breakfast at Baby Stacks in Summerlin!  So many good things about this place.  Here is what I got to try so far: - Red Velvet pancakes with buttercream frosting topping.  Small little pancakes just the perfect size for a sweet taste. - Portugese sausage with eggs and rice.  This place gives you more than 4 slices of sausage!  I hate when I have to ration out my Portugese sausage to last the entire meal.  There were 9 slices I believe!  Enough to get your fix.  Upgrade your rice for garlic rice.  You won't be disappointed. - Kalua pork and eggs benedict.  Usually kalua pork is too salty but this one is not too salty at all.  My roommate thought it was bland but I would rather it be less salty than too salty.  An interesting take on the usual eggs benedict.  I really want to take my parents here when they come to visit.  It is a cute little brunch place that anyone will enjoy.",

For a location that has a STAGGERING amount of business all day everyday they have the shitty ass excuse for call in orders. If you can't handle phone orders then DONT TAKE THEM.  Ridiculous. Disappointed.  Get with the program and upgrade your phone system. It also has static. Get a phone that has Call waiting as well. You gotta constantly call them until it isn't busy any more.

I was hesitant to order it because I have a tendency to gravitate towards savory foods, but after reading so many reviews about it, I knew I had to give it a go. As mentioned in other reviews, the pancakes are so soft, fluffy, and just filled with flavor. It comes with some cream and condensed milk in place of regular syrup, but you can ask for addition syrup on the side.   I also got Rick's adobo fried rice, which came wrapped in an egg! It was pretty good, however the rice was slightly hard and/or old. Other than that, the dish wasn't too salty and was yummy!   The service was a tad bit slow... when I went to pay, I was second in line and within 5 minutes, there were three parties behind me! Workers were nice, but slightly slow.   P.S.  The cashier told me there are five different locations around the Vegas area.",

My routine when first trying a restaurant for the first time is, reading the reviews and then looking at the pictures, keeping in mind the most popular dishes. Yes, I do judge a book by its cover...    First time, I tried the adobo fried rice omelette. I couldn't even finish it, it was too salty for my liking. With 6 people in our household, someone's gotta finish it somehow right? Wrong.... Could it be that we're Filipinos and we were spoiled by our grandmother's adobo? Maybe...  Second visit, it's the closest brunch place from my son's high school. I still had it bookmarked since I believe in second chances. So I'm on yelp and decided on what I was going to order before I start picking up my boys from school.   Red Velvet Full Stack- It's good! It's fluffy and it's True that it's breakfast and dessert at the same time. I, don't have a sweet tooth and if I like something that is anything desserty then you know it's not too sweet. The hubby tried it and so did the boys but by then end of the day, I was the one that finished these pancakes. I hate myself and so do my pants!   Country Fried Steak & Eggs- Back to me, I'm not a morning person but I do LOVE breakfast. And I LOVE country fried steak. If you take me anywhere for breakfast, you can bet I'm gonna order country fried steak. Ask my husband, my boys, friends, ask anyone. I will not be coming here for my country fried steak. The gravy wasn't as tasty and they didn't pound the meat enough,IMO.   Cora's Corned Beef Hash- My family and I love corned beef, they finished this. I didn't get to taste it due to how fast it vanished but by the looks of it, I don't feel like I missed anything.   Portuguese Sausage- I remember when I was younger, after a night out with my girlfriends, we'd go to El Dorado in Reno and order Portuguese sausage... I'd bring my family there for the Portuguese sausage. We didn't finish this either. I also opted for the garlic fried rice and wow the onions were humongous! NO!!!!! Just no.   Lastly, the regular buttermilk pancakes the boys did enjoy. I was too busy eating the red velvet pancakes I didn't get the chance to try this.   I spoke to my co-worker about my second visit at Babystacks and I'm not the only one that didn't enjoy the food there. She was also not impressed. So, I'm not the only one.",

Thankfully they're opening another one in Centennial and another just opened down the street so that may alleviate the long wait for a table. Mr. G had the eggs and garlic rice and let me just say if you want to ward off the vampires...  Service was fabulous, friendly and attentive.  I'm glad I came back and gave them another try.",

Crickets.  I had the Banana Fosters Crepes, they were perfect, with sweet syrup and the non-sweet crepes, complimenting each other perfectly. I asked if the bacon is crisp, she asked If I wanted it crisp and I explained crisp but not hard. It was perfection.  My GF The Locals Favorite, a burrito with Mojo. It was To Die For. Capitals firmly needed for this. When we go back next week I think we're all getting it, even my sweet food loving daughter.  Said daughter got the Macadamia Nut Pancakes. We both added cream Cheese Syrup, and barely used it cause everything was perfect.  My Mom got the Red Velvet Pancakes and ate so much that our chickens were depressed at the lack of leftovers.   We arrived at nine and had a five minute wait, we heard the hostess telling people 20 minutes at one point, so we'll be there at 8:27, our usual meeting time next week.  Parking was ample, and the coffee was good, never empty.  Paul H had given this place decent reviews, and Yelping about it discovered we both were Biscuits lovers, this place doesn't have the love you feel of Biscuits, however it may win out in the end!",

And then when we finally get sat they seat us at a table for 6 so we asked if we can get another chair and they said no because it's a fire hazard which is understandable, but they should have just waited till they had enough seats/tables available before seating us, so here we are squeezing 7 people in a tiny ass table.

Without the cream cheese \"syrup\" and whipped cream, it would have been nothing special at all.  We also tried the Adobo Fried Rice, which comes in am omelete. It was a nice, large portion, but I thought there could have been less eggs, and more flavor.   The other specialty pancakes we tried were the Cinnamon Tres Leches (the best, in my opinion-- DELICIOUS), the Smores (soso- basically just pancakes with chocolate chips and cinnamon cereal and marshmallows on it), and the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut (our second favorite, our second favorite after the Tres Leches).  As for the service, the place was really really crowded. We arrived around 11:45 and it was about a 30 minute wait. I kind of felt like we were rushed, as the server kept asking to take away our plates. Despite how often she came by to try to clear the table, we got zero refills on coffee or drinks. Not even water. It wasn't until she bright the check that she asked if we wanted more coffee. I get that it's busy, but I feel like they should pay more attention to their service, rather than try to rush out all their diners.",

I brought it to the waitress attention who was also a manager, and instead of apologizing she argued that's how they came. I pointed to other customers plates that there was a major difference yet still no apology and refused to give me a new order as I requested. I called when I got home, spoke to another manager who instead of an apology argued. Finally was offered a replacement. I asked if my brother could pick them up on his way home but was told I would have to drive all the way back and bring the small pancakes for a replacement.

The country potatoes are classic and flavorful with seasoned salt and has the right amount of crisp on it.  The lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for! It has a slight lemony flavor and the sauce (instead of syrup), is a light icing flavor syrup. They have a nice consistency and don't feel heavy. They are almost as light as a crepe but a little thicker. My husband, who is picky about pancakes, loved the lemon ricotta and the honey whole wheat.  We are making this our usual spot!!",

    "text": "Honestly, I just thought this place was okay.  I'm not really a fan of tight sitting quarters when I'm enjoying breakfast. Id much rather feel as though I can lounge, enjoy my coffee, and have a conversation that 20 other diners are privy to hearing. So, as for ambiance, I'd give the place a 1  The food was alright. Maybe I'm just partial to the places I've grown up with (The Egg and I, Blueberry Hill), but even still, I cant say the food is that great. The scrambled eggs had a very strange coconut flavor to them that caught me a bit off guard in a kind of unpleasant way. My pancakes tasted like, well, pancakes. Nothing I could not have gotten at IHOP (and I hate IHOP) Maybe I should have tried their famous Red Velvet pancakes, but not being a fan of anything Red Velvet, I didn't see how a pancake would possibly be so good as to change my mind.  The service was what one would expect in a busy breakfast joint with limited seating; nonexistent. I cant say they were rude, but nobody seemed to engage with us or give me any reason to feel welcomed. I felt as though I was being rushed out of my seat the moment the food was sat down on the table.   The only reason I cant give this place a much lower rating is because I'm sure there are people who love their famous Stack of RV, and because I didn't try it, I cant say the food is all that bad. Its just not my favorite. Coffee was great, and bacon was prepared perfectly. Had it have not been for the seating arrangement and the service I could have given this place a 4 star rating. It's just okay for me.",

It basically reminded me of going to my friends house (Filipino) after they had a party and in the morning making some scrambled eggs and eating some left over fried rice and adobo. Then serve have options for a side and recommended their special banana foster pancakes. Man that was just a taste of heaven! Also what was great about this place is the accommodation, since my gf is vegan they we're able to make a vegan breakfast burrito, did fresh vegetables and breakfast potatoes with avocado on the side. So needless to say great service great food definitely will be coming back soon!",

When done well, variety is such a nice thing, and there pancakes are pretty darn tasty. Of course, I went with the boring old honey whole wheat. I love my whole grains! They were executed just right, not too big, not too thick.    I enjoyed the hashbrowns. Would have enjoyed them more if my husband hadn't insisted I share! My eggs on the other hand weren't scrambled soft per my request, but that's not a deal breaker for me I suppose. The service was friendly, and the spot is cute. They definitely need to expand, as I don't know I could regularly justify waiting 30-45 minutes on a weekday afternoon to get a plate of pancakes. Still, it always makes me happy to see a local business killing it. When you have a hunch you need to brunch (or breakfast), add this to your list. But, you might want to call to check on the wait!",

    "text": "By sheer luck I stumbled upon this place when looking for good eats in Vegas! I'm not a pancake fan by any stretch of the imagination, but the reviews made them sound so good that I was a believer. I'm really happy I got over my hatred for pancakes and gave Babycakes a try.  My brothers, a friend, and I made this our last stop in Vegas before heading home. While it was a little out of the way for us, it was well worth it. We waited maybe 20 minutes, just long enough for me to change my mind on my order a few hundred times. I was going to go with the s'mores pancakes or the white chocolate macadamia pancakes, but I ended up giving in to the Yelp reviews and going with the red velvet.  And you thought my hatred for pancakes was bad, I despise red velvet. Not because it tastes bad (it doesn't), but EVERYONE is doing it. Every bakery and cupcake shop from here to Kalamazoo is doing it. Every baker on Cupcake Wars thinks they have the original, prize winning, most amazing, down-home, just like moms red velvet cupcake. It's run of the mill. It's tired. It's boring. It's so freaking cliche I can't handle it.  Then there was Babycakes. It's criminal what they've done here. A short stack (three pancakes, full stacks are six) of fluffy, brilliantly colored red pancakes command your attention from across the restaurant (and they did at least three times). On top sits a generous mound of whipped cream studded with chocolate chips. Heaven on earth! They come with a side of a lightly sweetened cream cheese syrup. The pancakes are prefect without the syrup, but add a little and you'll be sure to find yourself in a foodie nirvana. The red velvet pancakes were simply amazing. Sweet, tender, not at all like any other pancake I've had.  My brother had the cinnamon roll pancakes and they were delicious as well. I'm not entirely sure if the pancakes themselves were  regular pancakes or something else, but they were good. Topped with a cross-hatch of the cream cheese frosting, a dusting of cinnamon sugar, and a generous handful of walnuts and these things are phenomenal!!! They come with a side of regular syrup, though I doubt you'll be needing that.  My friend loved her omelette, but her pancakes were the epitome of my distaste for pancakes. This surely wasn't Babycakes' fault, I blame the pancakes. My brother loved his bacon pancakes.  Service was great, really friendly. We ordered and our food was out within minutes. Everyone was so friendly and the food was delicious. We will certainly be back!",

Being the lover of red velvet cupcakes that I am, I wanted to try out the red velvet pancakes that everyone was raving about to see if it really was that great.  Ladies and gents, the red velvet pancakes were better than just good. They were INCREDIBLY delicious! Every bite was like a fluffy piece of heaven. The last time I had red velvet pancakes was in LA and it was too overly sweet, but Babycakes did a great job of bringing out the flavor of red velvet without making it too sweet. The melted mini chocolate chips added a nice touch to the pancakes. The best part about it was the cream cheese syrup. It added a sweet touch to the pancakes and made it the perfect combo.   I tried the eggs benedict here as well, and it was definitely one of the better ones I've had as well. The eggs were cooked just right, and I barely tasted the yoke that oozed out from the middle. Note: I dislike the taste of yoke, and prefer egg whites, so I rarely order eggs benedict. But the eggs benedict I tried here was delicious. It came with a side of hashbrowns, and those were crispy and yummy as well.   Out waitress was attentive and great, parking space is ample, and I will definitely be returning again the next time I'm in town =)",

    "text": "I live in the Southwest part of Las Vegas and I usually find anything I need here. It takes a lot, something like red velvet pancakes, to make me venture out into another part of town. The possibility of trying red velvet pancakes made my friends and I wake up at 8 am on Presidents Day, drive about 40 minutes to Summerlin, and wait 45 minutes to get a table.  Despite all of that, I would do it all over again just to get a taste of those wonderful pancakes.  My two girlfriends and I shared these three menu items:  Red Velvet Pancakes - yes, it lives up to the hype. The full stack came with 6 pancakes. The pancakes tasted like flat cupcakes and they are to die for. It was the right amount of sweetness. You may expect the whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup to be overwhelming but everything was just right.  Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - Adobo chicken is a traditional Filipino dish so my expectations were a little high on this dish. It came with fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in egg like an omelet. It was very tasty and flavorful. We didn't really dig the macaroni salad. Someone was a little too liberal with the pepper.  Spam Scramble - this was the only dish we didn't care for. It tasted as simple as it sounds... Spam with scrambled egg. I guess we just expected something different. This was something anyone could make at home and make it better.  If I were only rating the red velvet pancakes, I would give Babycakes Cafe 5 stars, hands down. I love the pancakes so much that I would make the drive out there again on my day off just to get a taste of them again.",

The reason for coming here was the different types of pancakes...we were all satisfied!  The cream cheese syrup was amazing. We'd highly recommend coming here, but try to get there a little early.  We arrived about 8:30 and were seated right away, but on the way out there were some people waited to get a seat.",

There Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are amazing. Good prices, good portions, and friendly staff. The only downside can be actually getting into Baby stacks.  The location is small, and due to the awesomeness of the food, its very busy. If your in a hurry though, you can call ahead and have the food ready for take out! 5 Stars!",

    "text": "During a weekend of overeating and trying new places we opted for a brunch and the much talked about, highly Yelp rated Babycakes Cafe. We \"trekked\" across the valley with the anticipation of a 1 hour wait.   We were quoted 45 minutes, but because there were some larger parties in front of us we were seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Excellent.   The venue is pretty small but again, Yelp prepared me for that too. Here is what the family ordered:   Mom: eggs and sausage. She said the link sausage was excellent.   Dad: corn-beef hash. He also said this was excellent!   Hubs: biscuits and gravy, side of Adobo Fried Rice. Both were great and bonus the gravy is homemade.   Me: Mexican omelet. Yummers! The pico, sour cream and jalapenos made it.   Table: short stack of red velvet pancakes. WOW! Super light, not too sweet. I thought for sure they would be a sugar OD, but not at all. We were all impressed and surprised at how great they were. A must try for first timers for sure!   I really wish this was closer to home so we could go more often, but I do believe it was well worth the drive and I know we will be back again.",

Prices were excellent and I will defintely go back.  Our plan next time is to order different pancakes and just pass a cake around to everyone at the table.  Kinda pancake buffet style.",

I eat the pancakes plain and don't add any syrup or sauce because they get really sweet if you do.  I also ordered a side of garlic rice which was tasty until I took a big bite of garlic paste that wasn't spread through the rice well. Expect to have a long wait if you come for breakfast, they tend to get busy and if they could move to a bigger venue that would make things better.  Would I go back? Only if the wait to be seated wasn't 30 minutes plus.  Weekdays are probably better days to go than the weekend",

    "text": "What do I love about this place? The question should be, what don't I love about this place?   We had Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - a traditional Filipino dish made with marinated, shredded chicken and rice wrapped omelet style with green onions, accompanied with their homemade macaroni salad. The omelet is exactly what one would expect, if you ever had adobo...VERY, VERY GOOD! The mac salad was a little salty for my taste, but still very good!  Their Kalua Pig Benedict - toasted English muffin, topped with Hawaiian-style, slow-cooked, shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce...A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  If benedicts are what you're looking for, this one tops them all. My absolute favorite!  Our son had their bacon cheeseburger, well done, and fries. My husband was quite pleased and surprised that, yet again, another great entree!   Our daughter had their carrot cake pancakes. I love carrot cake to begin with, and I have to admit that it was even better than I thought!  To top everything off, we ordered their Red Velvet Pancakes with chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. If pancakes are what you're looking for, anyone who's been here would, I'M SURE, highly recommend the Red Velvet. Words cannot even describe such a simple dish that is OH SO, well...you'll just have to try it!!!    Don't think that we could eat all this. I'm actually sick to my stomach from all the amazing food! We packed up two take-home containers and went home to crash, but I wanted to take a moment to rate this restaurant. Definitely worth it. This being our first time there, we wanted to order so much off their menu to try what we heard/read rave reviews about, so we already knew we were \"taking leftovers\"...the question was, just how much?  Being New Year's Eve, it was really packed! They served us juice and coffee as we waited, which was extremely nice! You're happy with how their items are priced! Service was still very good for how busy it was.  EVERYONE, including us, walked out of there with a smile on their face.   WHAT A GREAT FIND! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for breakfast/brunch!!! ENJOY! :)",

    "text": "Wowee!  I finally got to eat here after hearing all about the red velvet pancakes.  I waited until a day that I had a good, long workout in before venturing over and imbibing what I assumed would be massive amounts of carbs.  Today was that day:  I ran 10 long miles (triathlon training) beforehand and then met a friend at 8:30am for the sugar-fest.  There was a short wait for our table since this is a cozy, little joint, but we were seated in 5 minutes instead of the 15 that was initially mentioned.  Service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  Afraid that the red velvet pancakes would be just too sweet for a whole breakfast, I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and hash browns with the pancakes on the side.  Yes, this girl can eat!  The nice surprise is that the pancakes were not as sweet as expected.  Yes, they come topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips, but the cream cheese syrup is on the side and one can control how much sweetness with that stuff.  I LOVED them!  My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were also delish.  I want to go back tomorrow and try some of the other tempting items on the menu--it may be a blessing or a curse that Babycakes is right down the street from my house!",

I won't add too much because the other 100+ reviews covers it but I thought the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice was a little too salty.  I think when the rice is cooked with the adobo it really absorbs the flavor and it gets too salty.  Others may like.  Still it was ok.  As the majority stated, the red velvet pancakes are the star of the show.  Order a 2 egg breakfast and pay the extra 1-2 bucks to upgrade to Red Velvet.  We'll be back.  Will try the benedict next time.",

It's full of flavor, not too much of one thing. Like the omelette, the hash browns are amazing. Both have a light buttery flavor.   I've tried a few of the other things that others I've gone with have ordered, and I'm amazed at how good the food is.   I'd also like to say that the staff is wonderful.

We arrived around 10 am,  so it was not very busy and we were seated right away.  The hostess noticed my daughter and immediately set us up in a spacious corner table with a high chair.  I didn't have to sit awkwardly with a squirming baby in my lap waiting for a place to put her.  Our server greeted us very quickly. She was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. Our drink order was taken right away,  my coffee was excellent and clearly fresh. (Bonus points for keeping it fresh after breakfast rush has slowed and there is a lull of customers.) For breakfast I had the strawberry cream cheese pancakes with a side of toast and a side of bacon. The food looked appetizing and beautiful.  I had gotten the toast for my daughter,  but it was crusty and tasted like it had been sitting out. She shared my french toast and Bacon with me instead. The French Toast was outstanding and the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes. She requested extra lemons and they were delivered immediately. I tasted a bite of her pancakes and they were fantastic. Our coffee was never allowed to become empty or cold.  Our check arrived on one bill which was promptly split when we asked, even though it was getting busier as early lunch dinners were arriving. The server didn't tell us to pay at the front,  so we waited a while before realizing.  In that time she did walk by us a couple times.  She was very busy,  but it might have been nice for her to stop and just let us know where to pay or ask if we needed something. There were customers waiting at this point so would have been nice for them if we had left that 5-10 minutes earlier. Didn't bother us too much though because we still had coffee and we were chatting.  Overall it was a great experience and i am excited to take my son and my husband to try it sometime!",

It then turned  pasty in my mouth sticking to the roof of my mouth. Luckily service was good and my coffee was frequently refilled.    Ricks Adobo Fried Rice was delicious.   Chicken fried steak was \"ok\" according to my brother.   Found a number of breakfast places this trip. Unfortunately Babystacks was not one of them.  Don't think we'll be back.",

    "text": "Great brunch spot! Beware of long weekend brunch wait. There is usually at least a 45 min wait on Saturday and Sunday at this location! The one further south has a shorter wait as they have a bigger dining space. Overall food is just a bit above average good but their pancakes are the bomb! There are so many options and we have yet to go through the entire selection. Red velvet, rocky road, white chocolate macadamia are among some of our classic favs. They also have special pancakes of the month that tend to be either a hit or miss. The German something something special was bomb but the most recent red white and blue in honor of the 4th is meh. But overall great location for a taste of island style brunch!",

An item that was ordered, that required little time was the very last item to come out. While people that got seated after us got there order before we did!! We were sat at a table in a tight spot even though there was many more empty ones as we did go when the rush hour was done. Honestly, I would have just walked out. I hope the employees are ashamed of the way in which they treated us and learn how to be hospitable.",

    "text": "Stack em up stack em stack em up!!!! As a lover of all things breakfast, baby stacks has definitely been a consistent force when I get my breakfast on. Why?? Because they know their skills and they play to it. It's vibe is small and charming, the staff is super nice and helpful and I've never not seen a crowd inside. It's also right next door to a bar, which means I have had to use them to soak up the previous nights questionable decisions. However eating here has always been a good decision. They have lunch foods like Kahlua pig and adobo fried rice but I stick to breakfast. I usually opt for the Piglet, which is several forms of pork in An omelette  or the Denver omelette, which is a The same everywhere else. All omelette can be had in skillet form, which is nice. The real star though are the pancakes. It's called baby stacks for a reason, so sitting down and stuffing your face full of pancakes is what you need to do. They have about 15 types and I haven't tried them all yet. The crown jewel is of course their red velvet, which is only my 4th favorite. I absolutely go bonkers for the white chocolate  macadamia or the German chocolate. Orange creamsicle is also a bit weird but good. The only two I can say I didn't like we're the honey wheat and PB&J. As much as I love PBJ, it just doesn't work on pancakes. However you're not stuck with that because you can do peanut butter and banana or peanut butter and Nutella My only gripes about this place is that their bacon game could step up. It's fine for an omelette but on its own, I expect more I'm not going to complain about the wait because not only is it usually less than what they say, I take it as a sign they're doing something right  TL;DR come in, eat some pancakes. Tip your waitress, walk out like a boss",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to eating here for months!   I've been busy but finally, I managed to plan another mini road trip:  Just like my donut adventure I filled up gas night before, google mapped babycakes, set the alarm....went to bed early.   DESTINATION: Babycakes. Mission: red velvet pancakes & kalua pig eggs benedict!!  I  was SUPER EXCITED! :)   I was coming from Henderson, I also had to pick up my friend, hop on 3 freeways, and took about an hour to get there, it was definitely a mini-road trip! Before I left the house, I made sure I had my coffee and cold water.   I woke up at 8, picked up my friend, and got to Babycakes at 10. Not bad.   It was a weekday 10am, and there was a wait. Not complaining, but just want to mention that. We waited almost an hour for a table. When we got there it was PACKED! And there was at least 10 people ahead of us, and some waiting outside.   If there's a long wait.... it MUST be good. I don't mind waiting if it's something worth waiting for. And having a friend with me, we were able to do a lot of catching up! With women, that's always a good thing! You know we love to talk! hehe :P   It was about an hour wait... till we got our table. 11am.   We already knew what we wanted, we did some research on the menu online the night before. hehe.   Full stack red velvet pancakes, kalua pig eggs benedict, and fried rice omelet PLEASE! And bring on the coffee, lots of it!   Our waitress was really nice. Checked up on us every few mins, offered to refill our drinks and coffee. And didn't rush us, she even told us that there's no rush and we can still have coffee and chat even after finishing our meal.   .......................Not sure if anyone else mentioned this but their COFFEE, is aaaaaaammazing!!!!!! I had about 4 cups of it! haha  I LOVE coffee, but I don't drink that much every morning, I have 1 cup a day. But at Babycakes, It was like crack! I had 4 cups, I need to find out what it is!!!!   So anyways, on to the glorious food.   I had the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, my friend had the Fried Rice Omelet, and we shared the red velvet pancakes.   Honestly.... Surprisingly, I fell more in love with the kalua pig eggs benedict!!!   I was looking forward to loving the pancakes more, but it was the opposite. I didn't think I would like the k.p.e. benedict, it was just suppose to be \"something to try.\"  But I fell....... hard.  There's just something about the yellow (hollaindaise?) sauce that was different than any other I had before. My fave meal of the day is breakfast, and my two fave breakfast items are pancakes and eggs benedict. I'm from Hawai'i and I love kalua pig, but on a eggs benedict...??? Who would've thought?!   It's aaaaaaaamazing! They were HEAVENLY!  It's definitely a must try!   I sampled my friend's fried rice omelet.....and I gotta say, I've had better. It was HUGE though. My friend didn't finish it, but didn't take it home either.   Okay now on to the star of the show: The Red Velvet Pancakes.  Hmmm... honestly, I think it's too hyped up. I've had pancakes else where and this didn't top it. It may be b/c my cousin makes these totally awesome red velvet cakes that can't compare to anyone elses... so the flavoring for the red velvet pancakes were just.... okay-good. My friends who told me about it, they loved it and said you don't have to add the cream cheese syrup, but I had to. I love intense flavors. It was Not spectacular. not heavenly. :( and I was sooo looking forward to it. My expectations were too high.   We ordered a full stack, it comes with 6 pancakes. The pancakes were thin and seemed small. For me, good pancakes = thick & fluffy, and at least medium size or large size. They seemed like they were smaller than those photos posted here or on their website. I don't think it was worth the $9 bucks. And I expected the chocolate chips to be slightly melted so I can smear it on my pancakes but they weren't. The red velvet pancakes are a good idea but I think they could've done better. But I will still try their other pancakes next time I'm there.   They were good, but this is not something I would look forward to the next time I'm here.  Others have different opinions so try it out for yourself. My friends who have tried, loved it. Don't take my word for it! It's definitely a must try, at least once!   OH...... and if I haven't mentioned it yet, they play HAWAI'IAN MUSIC here!!!!!!!  That's the first thing I noticed when I stepped in and I felt like I was back home. :) That's definitely a plus with me. The owners are from Hawai'i. And with the good service and essence of it, they post the kids colorings of their mascot up (that's cute.) I felt like I was at a breakfast place back home. :)  Looking forward to my next visit, I want to try the spinach eggs benedict and the smore pancakes.   Rumor has it the owner is looking into creating a 2nd location, I hope she puts it in Henderson! :) Cuz the 1 hour drive is too far! But still worth it. ;)",

Everything we have had here is outstanding except for the corned-beef hash which is the basic traditional kind that tastes like the canned kind.  I know people who love that, but I don't.  Even that, though, is good if doctored up with ketchup and hot sauce.  Anyway, all the pancakes we've had are incredible, including the red velvet and the banana cream pie.  Neither is too sweet or heavy, as one might reasonably fear, and they are light and beautifully prepared.  The lemon ricotta crepes are also great.  The Kalua Pig Benedict is different and delicious.  Hash browns are great, cooked nicely.",

I am an eggs benedict connoisseur and have returned my share over the years, but today's breakfast was not going to leave my sight after my first bite.  This was ridiculous good, here is the twister, it was a Country Eggs Benedict, perfectly toasted english muffins with country sausage (5 stars for the sausage), two perfectly poached eggs and then country sausage gravy covered the entire masterpiece.  Their gravy was on point.  You can taste the freshness of each ingredient in every bite.  Hubby ordered egg whites scrambled with Portuguese sausage and potatoes.  The Portuguese sausage was amazing, so much flavor in each bite.  The potatoes were spiced just right and cooked to perfection.  With his breakfast he also got red velvet pancakes.  The red velvet pancakes were sprinkled with chocolate chips and some whipped cream.  On the side was a cream cheese syrup that is unbelievable.  The pancakes were good, but the syrup is what makes them.    The staff is so nice, they greeted us immediately and sat us as soon as the table was ready.  My coffee was refilled often and everyone helps there.  You do not have to wait for a particular person, everyone takes care of all the tables.",

And let me tell you we were all very pleased with our meals and know for sure we will def. be ordering from here again.  The chicken adobo fried rice was awesome and it def hit the spot as being from Hawaii, adobo fried rice is a common thing out there and here in Vegas its always nice to find local Hawaii styled eateries. Yet again another local styled place here in Vegas that makes me less home sick. The service is quick and friendly and the portions are decent for the prices. There is ample parking and its free and its very easy to find as it sits right on buffalo. Def a place i highly recommend for a great breakfast and lunch.",

This place is a good 10-15 minute drive away from the strip. We arrived around noon time on a Tuesday but were still in the mood for breakfast since we didn't eat anything beforehand.   The place was filled with people but thank goodness there were still a handful of tables available so we didn't have to wait.  I did decide to yelp the place to check out the popular food items. The same two menu items kept coming up:  RED VELVET PANCAKES and the ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE. So what do we do?  of course we order:  *RED VELEVET PANCAKES  *ADOBO FRIED RICE  We decided to try both entrees and it was a big hit.  I've was a little apprehensive about ordering the red velvet pancakes because I have ordered them before at other places and they just don't really ever live up to the expectation of my favorite Red Velvet cupcake at Sprinkles but to be honest, it was pretty darn DELICIOUS.I loved how the pancake had a crisp taste on the outside but was also fluffy in the inside.  I only had a few bites of the ADOBO FIRED RICE OMELETTE but from the couple of bites, it tasted YUMMY.  Service  was great too so  I will definitely be back.",

Our waitress was so nice with us even when they lost our order, it didn't even seem like a big deal to us when she told us because she was so apologetic. The only good thing I did eat was the pumpkin pancakes. The whipped cream on top was actually one of the best things I ate here.   Their \"cream cheese\" syrup was meh. They should use more cream cheese in that syrup to keep the tang of the cheese. One fork dip for the testing and that was all I needed. They should also think about using real maple syrup...... Just sayin'. The hashbrowns were so generously pulled out of the freezer, browned a bit on each side with some thick grease, and put on a plate. Real tasty and this is me being real sarcastic. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.",

Next time I'm getting the large order of this and bathing in the \"syrup\"  The Mexican skillet was pretty delicious.  Crispy carnitas, spicy jalapenos and creamy sour cream really made the dish  I ordered a breakfast burrito, wet with gravy...oink oink  The cinnabun pancakes were too sweet for me personally but well enjoyed by others.  A group of five ate \"family style\" so I got to try a couple of dishes.  Our server was a very sweet young lady.  She was attentive and our order, albeit modifications, came out exactly as requested.  Kudos to her!",

Solid, but the sauce was a little too thick but it didn't prevent me from eating every bite.  The slow cooked pork was amazing!!   BF ordered a skillet thing that came with buttermilk pancake and the nice staff let us replace them with red velvet ones.    OMG! I don't like red velvet but the pancakes made me reconsider with the cheesecake frosting on the side!  Sadly they do not make ice coffee.  Vegas is hot, not sure why other places don't make ice coffee either?  They did offer to give me ice and put in my hot coffee but it's not the same =(",

We came in right after the 6:30 mass near by and we were sure happy we did, because about 5 minutes after we got seated, the place got PACKED!    Anyway, we got exactly what we came for, the adobo fried rice omelet.  If you've never tried it...gotta go.  They also have these pretty good red velvet pancakes; which definitely taste more dessert-ish than they do pancak-ish, he he he.  But we all enjoyed our food and the service was excellent.    A little far in my opinion, when there are other options near by, but if it was close to me, I'd definitely go pretty often!",

    "text": "Our family came in for breakfast today...we waited 55 minutes to be seated (which we were totally willing to do) but the problem began when the host (tall blonde kid with a man bun) welcomed his sister & her friend into the restaurant (after we waited nearly an hour) and then sat them before us. My husband became upset (understandably so) and had a confrontation with the young man host. The host then admitted to us that his sister called in to be put on the list & was sat minutes after arriving. We also called ahead to be put on the list and were told that was not an option. There's also a sign stating you can't call in, you must be present.  Anyway, the situation escalated and my husband became upset after waiting an hour, calling it to the hosts attention and nothing being done. Enter Monika Rodriguez. She came over without knowing the situation and suggested we leave. I waited til my husband walked out to talk to her. I explained yes I agree my husband was upset and probably got too upset. I explained I would however really like to talk to the owner so I could make her aware of what happened. Monika treated me EXTREMELY poorly in front of other customers & staff. I NEVER raised my voice, I NEVER argued (I in fact was apologizing that my husband got so upset), I explained no problem we would go but I just wanted some info first. She REFUSED to listen to anything I said. I told her what the host did and she said no way he did...I said ask him, he just admitted it.  She said oh well, I'll talk to him. She kept saying I refuse to give you the owners personal information. I explained AGAIN I didn't want anyone's personal information but I would like a contact office number or surely the owners email. I was denied all of these. Look, I'm a Regional Property Manager. I understand customer service. We were completely shafted by what the host did. Yes my hubby got upset. But I stayed behind to calmly discuss and I was treated horribly. Not cool babystacks. Not cool at all. I don't care how good your pancakes are, not worth being treated so poorly.",

Given the praise this place has received and how busy it gets, I didn't mind having to wait just to be the first customer.   Once I was let inside I didn't have to look at the menu because I already knew what I was ordering; red velvet pancakes. This was my first visit and I was blown away by how incredibly good the pancakes are! they are by far the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The cream cheese syrup and the whipped cream topping with little chocolate chips is simply an amazing combination! I will definitely return here, it's too good to miss out on.",

We actually got seated faster than they said it would take. I personally don't care if there is a long wait. A long wait means there are tons of people that want to eat there and I understand why. If you complain about a wait at a restaurant you are the same kind of person who thinks traffic is a personal attack on you. Wow I'm preachy.  The food is excellent. Everything we ordered was great. I can tell they care about making good quality food with real ingredients. There is no comparison between a place like this and some chain restaurant.   Lets talk about the food! I ordered the breakfast burrito and the carrot cake pancakes. Holy hot damn were those pancakes good. The breakfast burrito was also great, I ordered it with the sausage (I think its Peruvian sausage or something, I can't remember). My gf ordered the Two eggs and bacon with the red velvet pancakes. It really is like having cake for breakfast. They are amazing, I get why they red velvet pancakes are so popular.  That's it! Go here and eat food you jerk!",

    "text": "We kept hearing about Babycakes from our friends that live out around Summerlin or Lower Utah area LOL and because of the distance we put them off. But, we were around the area running errands and found some time to see what everyone was hooting and hollering about. I'm glad we did.  We walked in around 11:30 and it was semi crowded. We got seated quickly and service was quick. Right away someone took our drink order and also brought our daughter a kids menu and crayons (that was very important). My daughter also noticed the decor, especially the 2 huge butterflies on each side of the beautiful flat screen that was on ESPN. I really liked that decor...not the butterflies but the ESPN. They also put up the kids Babycakes menu colorings all around the restaurants. You can also see the cooking area, it is small but they churn out ONO grindz!  This was our 1st time but we've heard enough through our friends and  Yelpizzles on what we should try. My wife ordered the Cowboy omelette which was pretty big and ordered their new Rock Road Pancakes. I ordered the Kalua Pig benedict.  ~RR pancakes. Our kids loved it and what kid wouldn't. The chocolate pancakes were fluffy and loaded with mini marshmallows, choco syrup, slivered almonds, and topped with whipped cream. They also have other pancakes which you can get in full or short stacks. ( we'll try these next time) -Red Velvet -S'Mores -PB & Jelly -Lemon Ricotta -Carrot Cake -Bacon Pancakes -Whole Wheat  ~Cowboy omelette-  For $9.95 she got good size 4 egg omelette with ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. And you can get either toast or get 3 buttermilk pancakes. You can also upgrade the pancakes to any of the above.  ~Kalua Pig Benedict was really good. I've had this before at other restaurants and they get thumbs down, but Babycakes does it right. The Kalua Pig-shredded pork has a nice smokey flavor and not too salty is served on a toasted English muffin, topped w poached eggs, and a nice hollandaise sauce (they don't slather it on...It was just on the eggs). They also put a bit of sauteed cabbage on the tender Kalua pig which added a nice crunch. You might think to yourself \"Why cabbage?\" In Hawaii we grew up eating a dish called Kalua Pig and Cabbage, it was an easy and delicious home cooked meal. This a favorite in my book.  I saw the person next to me order the Loco Moco and i wanted to reach over and snake a bite from him. But, my wife said don't do it. This will be my next choice.  Babycakes is worth the drive and the wait. We've been here once and it won't be our last. But, we do have a message to Babycakes owners....Babycakes please make your way to GVR area...PLEASE!!

The menu items suggest a Hawaiian influence, and I would recommend that you stick to those items.  The flavor of the burrito was insipid. The poached eggs were soggy (they brought them in a bowl that was filled with either water or uncooked eggs), the fruit bowl had very little to it (5 grapes, where 2 were rotten, 2 overripe strawberries, 1 cube of melon), and everything was soaked in butter.  The  best bet is the pancakes (the title character in their menu) and the Portuguese sausage.  I also noticed that the decor near us was covered in dust curtains. This makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen.  The server was very nice and accommodating. The food came promptly.  Overall, this place is trying to be too many things ( pancake house, Mexican breakfast, Hawaiian food, breakfast basics). They should just stick to pancakes and spend the money they spend on spoiled fruit on real maple syrup and fresh squeezed juices.  I give them one star for the staff. The second star is for the wait time for food.",

I ordered the Corned Beef and Hash and the fiance ordered the Rick's Adobo  Fried Rice. I ordered the blueberry pancakes on the side with my order and my friend ordered the banana pancakes. (Yes, I didn't try the Red Velvet Pancakes only because I'm not that big of a fan of it). My corned beef and hash was cooked very nicely. It was crispy but moist all in one. Seasoned potatoes were a lil dry, but a lil over medium egg yolk solved that problem. I also tried the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. What an awesome concept....eggs and fried rice in one. Yum! My pancakes.....well I don't think anything can beat my light fluffy blueberry pancakes from Maui....so that was a bust for me.  Overall, service was good, we all left full and plates were emptied.

And so affordable. The red velvet pancakes, oh my! They offer a very wide menu with a great variety, it'll be hard to decide what to get. I'm really keeping my fingers crossed that this place makes it, I'll def be spreading the word!",

It's a pretty small place but the quality of the food was amazing. Along with the Red Velvet pancakes we ordered the Carrot Cake pancakes and Almond Joy Pancakes with a side of hash browns. The carrot cake pancake is exactly what it sounds, it was just like eating a slice of carrot cake. Pretty delish.. the Almond Joy pancake was a little overwhelming. I think that flavor should stay with the chocolate bar alone. We had a 45 min wait, the service was good and fast. They have such a diverse selection for pancakes its amazing but if you're feeling overwhelmed just try the red velvet, you can't go wrong! They serve the pancakes half stack and full stack. Half stack is 3 pancakes and full is 6. Not sure who can eat a full stack but kudos to you. This is definitely one of those places you kinda have to try once.",

For the quality of their food (at least what I had), their prices are VERY reasonable. I had an adobo fried rice omelette and white macadamia nut pancakes. The omelette was HUGE and being Filipino, I can say it tasted very much like adobo. The pancakes were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! I'd have liked bigger pieces of macadamia (they were tiny little slivers that you almost missed), but I'm just someone who loves nuts, so that's only my preference. If they tell you to wait a while, do it. It's COMPLETELY worth it.",

    "text": "Went here looking for a real good breakfast spot after reading the reviews.  I must say that overall, I was pretty disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, I really did, as I want a great breakfast spot.  This is a pretty small (about 10 tables) spot in a little shopping center.  First off, the orange juice I ordered was tasted like cheap concentrate, which is a knock against them in my book.  Second, the service was pretty slow.  We were a party of 6, and they brought 2 plates of food, then a few minutes later, 2 more.  By the time they brought the last 2 orders, I had already almost finished my breakfast.  Not to mention, one of the last orders was bacon and eggs, and the bacon was ice cold when it came out.  Third, the potatoes that came with some of the entrees were just frozen bag potatoes (the little squares), which were mediocre at best.  I had a full order of blueberry pancakes, which were fine, but nothing to write home about.  They say they are homemade, but does that just mean you made some instant batter?  The pancakes were not terrible, although I thought they were a little rubbery, and the portion size did not blow me away.  My wife, however, did enjoy her cowboy omelette quite a bit.  She stated the mix and texture of ingredients was very good, although I do not enjoy omelettes so I cannot comment directly.  Also, some in my party had huevos rancheros, which had a pair of absolutely dry and miserable looking cheap store bought tortillas in them.  The menu is filled with a lot of esoteric items, like red velvet pancakes, loco moko, kalua pig, etc.  I think that a great deal of the interest in this place is the variety of unique breakfast offerings on the menu.  However, I found that for standard breakfast fare, the quality and service were pretty mediocre at best.  Now to be fair, the service was polite and friendly, just not that efficient.  Overall, I found what most of us ordered to be perfectly average or below average, so I am not sure where the fuss is.  Maybe if I had ordered something unique like the red velvet pancakes, but as I said before, I would expect better work on the basics.",

    "text": "So, I finally got to go here.  I brought my dad here for a belated fathers day breakfast.   We both had the two egg breakfast with pancakes-regular and red velvet.    First, my eggs were delicious!  They tasted so fresh and were cooked just as I had asked-over medium.  I got them with seasoned potatoes which were not seasoned at all-just fried little squares.  But, that is fine cuz they soaked up my yolk just fine.  Dad said his eggs were great and he got hashbrowns that were cooked perfectly crispy and not at all greasy.  Now onto the pancakes.  He got just the plain pancakes and they were not good at all!  It was like the dry mix was missing the sugar or there was too much baking soda.  They almost had a sour taste-blech.  I was dying to try the red velvet.  I love, love, love red velvet cupcakes but sometimes they are just too sweet for me.  So when i read about these and that they aren't that sweet I had to come in and try them.  Okay, they were just okay.  I just feel like there was something missing.  They were a good texture and the cream cheese syrup was okay.    I will come back and try other things.  The omletes looked really good as do the eggs benedict, sandwiches...well it all looked good.  This is a nice small NON-CHAIN (love that) place that hopefully continues to do well and sticks around.  We need more of this kind establishment to help give the town some heart!",

Ok, by far the best pancakes I have ever had.  they come with a cream cheese syrup.  They are amazing! Just ordered a short stack but with a side of bacon.  The bacon was a wonderfully smoked bacon.  Almost tasted like it was smoked like a good brisket.  Very good!  There was a bit of a wait since the restaurant is kind of on the small side. It is worth the wait.  The waitress and cashier were both very delightful and attentive.  Will have to go back and try the biscuits and gravy or something else.",

The chicken fried steak was definitely a pre-breaded, frozen piece of crap.  The gravy on top also tasted canned.  I'm sure it was.

The food is good but not great...Loco Moco, good, but its not that hard to make and for 8.25, thats a little pricey for that dish. The Adobo Fried rice is good, but similar to a lot of Filipino Adobo at any other Filipino Restaurant and again is pricey. Also, the portions are very average. Its a ten to 12 dollar meal that doesn't really fill you up like island food can, so bring a bag of chips or get ice cream on  the way home  Eggs benedict are good and there are a lot of different styles of it so that cool to try. Red Velvet pancakes are good if you really have a sweet tooth. $4 dollars for three strips of o-k tasting bacon....oh no.....  The service, its a little slow...its gets really crowded, and the servers can be pretty smug...Half of the servers are really hospitable and the other half seem annoyed. We were a big group and we waited about an hour... My friends Waffles came out so late, that he asked to cancel them...for Waffles....there explanation was that the waffle machine wasn't working correctly and they wanted to make them just right...He cancelled but they still gave it him when our meal was basically done, and they still charged him...really...and they were just O-K.....  I love the ideas in this restaurant, but I expected way more and have had way better food, at a better price with better service.  It was Island style Las Vegas food....",

My sister and I sampled the red velvet pancakes, cinnamon roll pancakes, spam and eggs and a side of country gravy and potatoes.  I thought the red velvet pancakes were just OK.. I think they'd be better without all of the melted chocolate on top of them. It seems to be way to sweet/bitter with them. The cinnamon roll pancakes were DELICIOUS.   The spam was disappointing, and I LOVE spam. This was actually too salty to eat. The breakfast potato is just your run of the mill frozen breakfast potato so nothing to say really there. The gravy almost tasted like a ham gravy or maybe bacon gravy. There wasnt really any meat to be seen in it although it did taste more homemade than some places I've had gravy at.   I would go back to maybe try some other pancake varieites",

It took a bit longer to get our food order though.   10 minutes to be exact.  I tried making eye contact with either of the two servers with no success.  I wasn't even sure who our server was.    Finally our server came, apologized for the wait and took our order.  She was sweet.  My son ordered the full order of red velvet pancakes.  Delicious.  The best pancake in Vegas.    I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich.  I usually order this slightly spicy sandwich that is really tasty.    This time, however, the sandwich was flavorless.  After 2-3 bites, I opened the sandwich and the chicken filet didn't look blackened.  I showed it to our server and she agreed that it didn't look right.  She apologized and took the plate.    It took about 10-12 minutes to get the replacement sandwich.  My son was already done with his meal.  The sandwich was tasty but I had kind of lost my appetite.  I gave half to my son and ate the other half.    Now here is what disappointed me.  I would have thought that the server would've offered to pay for my soda...offer a little dessert...something.   By all accounts, this was not a good dining experience.  Nothing.    I suppose I could've been a jerk.  Maybe that would've been more effective?",

    "text": "Stopped in on a Thursday morning last week.  Very quaint family run diner.  A little on the small side for Vegas but just about right for a nice sit down meal with friends and family.  Friendly atmosphere and staff make you feel like your in someone's home rather than a strip mall.  Although comfortable, I did not like the bar table setup we were seated at.  About half the seating is bar height and the rest your normal booth/chair setup.  Menu is a mixed bag of Breakfast fare, definitely Asian/Hawaiian influences with your typical pancakes, waffles, and benedicts.  What we tried:  Loco Moco; bland gravy and patty was prepackaged and had no flavor.    Adobo fried rice; definitely fried but no distinct adobo flavor...the presentation was odd as well, almost sent it back thinking I got the wrong order (rice is stir fried then folded into an omlette) .  The macaroni salad that came with the omlete was runny and bland...and seriously who serves mac salad for breakfast?  The food was decent but not exactly what I was expecting... I think maybe they are going for Hawaiian/Asain-Fusion on some of the items (Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Benedict) but for the most part I think they are missing it.    Gets pretty busy so make it early on a weekday to save yourself the wait.",

I looove a good breakfast place and enjoy supporting, local mom and pop family type operations, so I was definitely looking forward to naming Babycakes as my new b'fast/brunch stop.  Never mind.  So awful all the way around that I will not even go into all the details.  The entire experience was a loss - it started from the indifferent greeting (barely a look up in our direction from the hostess at the podium/cashier desk in front) followed with painstaking slow service and then topped off with cold, rubbery food thrown on a plate.  The bad service was not offset by the equally poor food, or vice versa.  And what is with the grunge/slime in the iced tea!  How hard is it to brew tea?  That should have been my sign to leave befor even attemtping to eat.  Bad, bad!",

My first time here and by the looks of the food on the table and how crowded it was being a wednesday afternoon, I knew it was gonna be good.  My friend was on her whack diet (she ain't even fat), so she just ordered tuna salad and biscuit with gravy.  I ordered the mexican omelette and red velvet pancakes, which I never there was such a thing.  The mexican omelette had marinated carnitas, sliced jalapenos, pico gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with sour cream.  It was pretty good but the red velvet pancake was the main dish I enjoyed the most.  I have never been a big fan of anything red velvet and this is the first.  She gave me a bite of her biscuit and gravy but I thought she was done with it and I killed it.  Haha she was like really, I look down for one second and you eat it all without sharing, ooops.  Very affordable too with friendly servers who attend to you right away and checks up occasionally, despite the place being busy.  I will definitely be coming here for breakfast again. My ex and her tuna salad, what a waste of visit to baby cakes for her.",

They were good and I cleaned my plate of the small portion, but if they were around the corner from me I am not sure they would make the regular spot list.  This place was good, but I felt a little over-hyped.  The regular breakfast entrees (non-dessert ones, lol) didn't look any more fan fare than any other \"good\" breakfast.  I was not drooling over anyone else's plate, that is.    My main purpose in review was for anyone making the trek and being underwhelmed.

I give automatic 4 stars for mom and pop places that are innovative, offer something special and follow up with fantastic service. Babycakes have real potential to hit all those marks if they correct a couple of things:  1. Service is fast and efficient but doesn't really have any personality that stands out. 2. My poached eggs came out well and I didn't even get the opportunity to send it back because no one came to check on us.  3. Your red velvet pancake is the bomb, but it's not showcased. It's like having Kobe Bryant on your team, but keeping him on the bench. Why bother?  4. The wait is atrocious for people who would want to trek here for breakfast. If you live far away and come here to wait for another 45 min - 1hr, you may leave feeling disappointed.   I guess my expectation for this place was too high. And considering I value my Sunday so much, I hated the fact that I spent 2.5 hrs on something that didn't live up to what I had imagined.",

The short stack split amongst 3 people (1 pancake per person) was enough for us, since it was THAT sweet!

All were bland in flavor, as the banana pancakes had very little banana, and my husband's bacon pancakes had just 3 tiny pieces of bacon in them.  He was extremely underwhelmed and annoyed.  There were other little things that I found annoying.  The potatoes were not that good and were riddled with seasoned salt.  They looked like the egg works potatoes that I hate so much.  I love big huge chunky pieces of real potato that is soft and velvety inside and crispy on the outside, like Beach Cafe does.  Sausage was the same stuff I could have gotten at a cheap buffet and cooked in the same manner.    Overall just a very ordinary experience.",

    "text": "This restaurant appears to be a mixed bag for me.  In some things, it is amazing, and in others, not so great.  First as to ambience and first impressions:  The restaurant is small (maximum capacity 50) in an uninspiring but clean strip mall.  upon entering the restaurant, it is clean, with warm homelike decorations and a warm inviting somewhat neutral light brown paint color that you might see in model home.  The decorations are ones that you might get in a bed bath and beyond or pier 1 imports which give the ambience of a homelike restaurant environment.  Some of the tables are high stool oriented that use comfortable leather stools as the chairs.  Other tables are against the wall using hardwood bench seating as chairs.  Initially the hostess was welcoming.  But within moments the hostess gave a cold uncaring impression.  She stated that the table would be ready in a few minutes and then proceeded to do cashier work, which was fine.  However, three new customers came in and for no less than 5 minutes, she never spoke with the new customers.  Not even the quick look up and \"I'll be with you in a minute.\"  She would even walk past myself and other customers and not establish eye contact.  Even when she did establish eye contact, there was no smile.  Not something that will destroy an experience, but also not something that would help the overall feel of the restaurant.  Unfortunately, after being seated no menu was provided and it took the waitress a few pregnant pause minutes to get the menu to me.  I had the feeling that she was the only waitress in the restaurant -- which I later found out was not the case.    However, when she did provide the menu, her attitude and service were warm and friendly with many smilies.  She certainly helped to overcome the feelings that the hostess had created.    Food:  In this regard too, the restaurant did some things amazingly well, and others oh so mediocre.  For the good, they are known for their red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and they are very good.  If you don't like sweet, don't try them.  They are inviting and indulgent.  They come with a creme cheese syrup.  The two combined make for a taste of red velvet cake combined with a sweetness of a cinnabon roll with syrup.  Decadent.  The waitress invited me to have them as a side to my omelette which was just perfect -- rather than a full stack of pancakes.  In addition, I had the mexican omelet which included carnets, jalapenos, cilantro, onions, cheese.  The combination of the omelet and the pancake made for a wonderful confluence of tastes from spicy to sweet and then back.  With such a wonderful combination, the frozen potatoes that came with the omelet was such a violent speed bump on my wonderful country road journey for breakfast.  The potatoes were clearly dull, uninviting in taste and such a contradiction with the other dishes that you are now questioning why you came to the restaurant in the first place.  It is a shame that they couldn't just pan fry some homemade potatoes to complement an otherwise wonderful meal.  I felt like was experiencing a painting by an artist and as I moved from left to right I realize that the oil painting of the mona lisa is done in exquisite detail, but the background is quickly drawn in crayons because there is a deadline to put out volumes of art.  Overall, I would still try to go to the place for an experience.  I would probably go again to see if the experience was the same, but I worry that the generic school cafeteria style could infect other dishes.",

    "text": "After hearing about their infamous red velvet pancakes, and taking advantage of their Groupon offer, we decided to give this place a try.  First of all, this place is small - we're talking seating for less than 50 people, give or take a few. I had read that there was usually a wait due to the popularity of the place and the lack of seating, but luckily for us, we were seated immediately when we arrived at 9:30 on a Tuesday morning.   We ordered:   Country fried steak: I almost always order country fried steak when it's on a menu, and this one was one of the better ones I've had in Vegas. It was really tender, and the outside was nicely seasoned. I also loved the fact that it came with country gravy with breakfast sausage in it - it was yummy and tasted like it was homemade.  Eggs: My eggs were over-easy, and they were cooked perfectly; no runny whites, only runny yolks, just how I like them. Hubby had scrambled eggs, and they were nice and fluffy.  Potatoes: I had the hash browns and Hubby had the seasoned potatoes. The potatoes were crispy and didn't require any salt, but were pretty average.  Sourdough toast: I don't know how many times I've ordered sourdough toast only to be disappointed. That wasn't the case this time - this is the real deal - not that imitation white bread posing as sourdough.  Corned beef hash: This was the canned version, which was disappointing. If there's one thing on a breakfast menu that most people expect to be homemade, it's corned beef hash.   Red velvet pancakes: Hubby was nice enough to offer me one bite, and boy, was it delicious! It's the perfect balance of the red velvet flavor in a fluffy pancake. It came with whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and... wait for it... cream cheese syrup! I wanted another bite, but Hubby gave me that \"I love you, but don't even think about touching my pancakes or I will seriously stab you with my fork\" look. Yeah, I think he liked the pancakes. ;)  Service was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back soon.",

My choice is always the red velvet, it's like having dessert for breakfast, need I say more?  I don't have to use the cream cheese syrup as it is good by itself.  My mom and I always share a spam scramble plate (scrambled eggs, spam, rice, and furikake) which appeals to my Filipino side and the red velvet pancake.  My husband always try different types of banana pancakes, he got the banana cream pie this past 4th of July.  Our children loves the s'mores one.  Our youngest who has a hard time finishing his food actually ate spam scramble and his own stack of pancake and finished it all!  They also had adobo chicken fried rice which is very good but can be too much if you have to finish it yourself, so share!  We can't wait to visit our parents again and have delicious breakfast at Baby Stacks!  Btw, the wait is super long...but definitely worth it.  Service is good and fast.",

Tried the cinnabun pancakes, the bacon pancakes, the kalua pig benedict and of course no breakfast is complete without a side of bacon.  Starting with the kalua pig benedict with shredded pork shredded cabbage egg poached medium and hollandaise on an english muffin. I thought it was awful the hollandaise was a strange bright yellow almost gold instead of the very light yellow which I think is normal.  The whole dish had a strange taste to it thanks to that sauce. The bacon pancakes were good but nothing you couldn't make at home by just dropping crumbled bacon into batter while making pancakes. Side of bacon you cant go wrong with, it would be very hard to mess that up. The cinnabun pancakes were delicious. A little too sweet to make a whole meal out of them but as a side of 3 pancakes it was just right. I also got a side of cream cheese syrup which went great with the cinnabun pancakes. Big sugar rush though.  Service was attentive,  coffee was refilled, food came out quickly everything you would expect from a breakfast spot. I will give it another shot but definitely order different stuff.",

Anyway, tried the Red Velvet Pancakes and Eggs Benedict made us instant believers of this place. The servers are also great and efficient and not too pushy. Food was served immediately even if you waited a long time for an open table. Also tried the Adobo Fried Rice, White Chocolate Pancakes, Carrot Cake Pancakes eventually on the succeeding visits and haven't been disappointed, not one bit or one time.

We had to wait a long time till our food came out and when it did I wasn't too impressed compared to all the good things I had heard. I thought I'd give it another chance with the boyfriend this time because he loves breakfast food. As soon as we walked in I regretted it. It was dirty and kind of embarrassing because I had chosen where we were to eat. We got seated by the door and were FORGOTTEN about. No one came by, looked at us, acknowledged us, or gotten us water. They must have clearly seen us sitting there. We were so irritated, but didn't want to drive elsewhere. I walked up to the front counter and explained that we have been waiting 15 minutes and no one has helped us. No one felt bad at all. We finally got a waitress who rushed us and made us feel like a burden. Needless to say it ruined my meal, and frankly my morning. I've never had worse service. Fast food has been better! I don't mean to be harsh, but that is NOT customer service.",

I couldn't detect any lemon or cheese taste.  They served it without any syrup and I had to ask for the cream cheese syrup which I was informed cost 75 cents extra.  I thought the ricotta cheese would be rolled inside the crepe but the 3 crepes tasted just like plain crepes.  You could do much better at IHOP for pancakes and the long wait in the small cramped restaurant just wasn't worth it.",

The place is clean and bright and was pretty quiet for a weekday morning.  I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice. Disappointing. The rice has hard and had a few charred pieces of chicken lending it a strange burned off -flavor. The egg \"wrap\" was thin and oily. I can usually finish a whole plate but it was so unappetizing I only had a third. The adobo fried rice rules at Thelmas... check em out. My husband had the Loco Moco and it was alright. It was the standard Hamburger patty and brown sauce found in many valley local places, nothing special. The kids had the children's breakfast - eggs & pancakes. Also nothing special. Our big mistake was getting only a side of Red Velvet Pancakes to \"try em out\". They were heavenly! I almost like em better than Nothing Bundt Cakes Red Velvet Bundt. They came out hot soft and fluffy, with a light puff of whipped cream and choco shaving. There was a side of cream cheese topping which was heavenly drizzled on top. Just lovely. It was funny watching a grown man wrestle over pancakes with a determined and hungry five year old. Priceless. Save yourself some disappointment and go there for the Red Velvet Pancakes... you won't be sorry!  Staff was very friendly and attentive.  The tables were very small though and crammed together so if you want some breathing room I recommend you come on a weekday cause the weekends are packed!",

My husband ordered the adobe fried rice and didn't enjoy the flavor and the mac salad was bland.

We arrived at 9:30; was told the wait would be 1 1/2 hrs to 1 hour and 45 minutes. As crazy as it sounds we decided to wait but left the premises and was back within an hour thinking we would have at least another 30 minutes before we would be seated. We gave our name and asked how much longer the wait would be, only to find they had called our name within 30 minutes and not 1 1/2 hour as they had told us. I think the girl at the counter felt bad and said \"let me see if I can seat you now.\" (obviously there was a table available) She asked an Asian girl who I later found out is one of the owners daughters. She said no; we would have to wait another 30 to 45 minutes now. I explained; this was our 4th attempt to eat here and was told the wait would be much longer than what it was, are you so busy you can't accommodate 2 people? The Asian girls answer was \"yes we are.\" I then asked for a manager and Vangeie (Asian girl) informed me it is a family owned business and she and her sister are the managers and there was no one Else to talk to. I told her I would be writing a review and asked Vengeie for her last name (Salonga); she then told me \"Oh and by the way my sisters name is Liberty.\" It is pathetic when you think you can be so cocky and disrespectful as the owner to think your business is invincible. Vangeie; I have been a business owner for 25 years and you need to learn about customer service if you want to stay in business. You might be so busy now you can send people away without a care, but restaurants come and go in this town and with your attitude and lack of customer service as the owner don't count on being around long. This is a small town and word gets out. Remember if one person has a bad experience they will tell 10 other people....make that 20. How stupid you are not knowing business 101.....customer service.",

Though the counter girl told us it would be a 30 to 40 minute wait and wrote our names on the list on the wall, with 4 people ahead of ours. The \"hostess\" was SUPER RUDE! She made it seem like they were doing US a favor by ALLOWING us to eat there! To make it worse, she started a new guest list, and after adding the next 10 customers that came in, she out those of us who had already been waiting AFTER THEM! So the 4 people in front of us quickly turned into 14 people in front of us! When I asked the hostess if she could adjust the list so that those of us who came in first could still be at the top of the list instead of the bottom, she became RUDE and snapped back \"I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!\" .. well, obviously, you don't.. So, that 30-40 minute wait turned into an hour and 15 minutes and there were STILL 5 people ahead of us! Which is messed up since there was only 4 ahead of us when we got there! To make it even better, some one missed their name because they went shopping to kill time had come back 30 minutes after their name was called and was still put ahead of those who had been waiting patiently!! I regret buying those Groupon tickets for Babycakes now, because now I'm stuck either forfeiting the money or going back to that hell hole full of rudeness.  I even tried calling and speaking to a supervisor, but no one will return my calls, so I guess management cares as little for their customers as their \"lovely\" hostess.  I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!! You get more friendly service at Dick's Last Resort where they intentionally treat you like crap!",

The syrup on the pancakes was amazing...the red velvet pancakes were beautiful, but sort of tasteless (at least I couldn't really tell they were flavored). However, the sprinkling of chocolate flakes and the whipped cream more than made up for it.  I love everything about this place and I would highly recommend those who only stay and play on the Strip to make this 30 minute drive to Northern Vegas for this breakfast treat.

I mourned.  Hazelnut pancakes were dry but the whipped cream wasn't bad.   Didn't catch my server's name. Didn't catch much of him actually.  The hostess asked how everything was. I said \"Eh. Barely okay.\" She cheerily continued ringing me up and said, \"great!\"  That's about it.",

I would say that they are better at a quick waffle or pancake plate as well as a fast egg plate than HHAGG. The presentation is great as long you don't need fireworks and fanfare to set the tone of your breakfast. If you want rapid service, fresh, hot coffee, and fresh food, then this is the place. While not nearly as expensive as HHAGG, the quality and size of portions are not as great, either. This is a perfect place to meet up for a quick and quality breakfast, with several locations in the LV area, although I can only vouch for the one at Smoke Ranch and Buffalo. If I can't get to, or am not willing to spend the money required to eat at HHAGG, then this is my guaranteed second place to go eat breakfast. It's an easy recommendation for any casual breakfast eaters.",

    "text": "I have a new favorite breakfast spot! I noticed several benches outside and I can only assume that is because sometimes the line is out the door from people waiting to get into this place. Lucky us though we got in before a rush came through and nabbed a spot without wait. The inside is clean and the employees are very friendly. Seating seems limited for the amount of people wanting inside. I saw the occupancy sign said it could seat just 50! If BabyStacks keeps putting out such a good breakfast they might have to move to a bigger location.   The coffee here is awesome! It is full of good flavor. This is one of those cups of coffee I just really enjoyed sipping on and could have stayed all day just for that! I figured my first visit wouldn't be complete if I didn't order pancakes. With all of the options BabyStacks offers for pancakes how does anybody ever decide?! I chose the \"Banana Cream Pie\" pancakes. OMG! These pancakes are the b-e-s-t I have ever had!! The pancakes are so darn thick and fluffy and have such good flavor. There was banana in the pancake batter as well sliced fresh all over the pancakes. It also had banana cream sauce, almonds and pie crust on it.  I only ordered a *short* stack and couldn't finish my meal. The short stack cost just $5.75. What a great price! Others in my party grubbed on \"Carot Cakes\" and \"PB & Bananas W/Chocolate Chips\" and of course I had to try a bite of both of those. I would order everything at our table over and over again it was just all so good. I will be back for sure!  Our server was excellent. I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was and he suggested \"Portuguese Sausage And Eggs\". He said they have a \"Garlic Rice\" that pairs very well with this dish. He had me at garlic rice! I need to try this rice for sure at some point.   They have a great kids menu at affordable prices.",

The taste was not to sweet like a regular Red Velvet cake. The cream frosting and crushed macadamia nuts complimented it just right. And the Loco Moco was the biz! Gravy was soo good! It had little chopped up mushrooms too. Patty and egg cooked just right. This place will definitely be a must next time I'm back in Vegas. I highly recommend that you try this spot out.",

The owners of Babycakes are some mighty nice PILIPINO (I say it like my nanay) people!  Have you eaten yet?  Babycakes is packed in the morning especially on weekends because they are only open for breakfast and lunch up until around 2 PM!  So if you can get over your \"What happens in Vegas...stays in Vegas\" hangover get here early!  If you get to Babycakes at prime dining time be prepared for a bit of a wait.  But it's ok because it's worth it.  We meandered here on a Furlough Friday for us and intended not to spend any money of this day of no pay.  Boy was that a mistake!  We 'accidentally' pulled into the parking lot just to see what the crowd was like.  Once that smell of pancakes and grilled goodies hit me I couldn't help it.  We got out of the car and walked in.  Thankfully, no wait!  I just couldn't keep myself from looking around the dining area and checking to see if I was related to anyone in the place!  So bad...I know!  So many Asian people around me...like I was at a Wow-Wow-Wee taping!  Or a Journey concert with Alan Pineda as the lead singer!  Alas, there was no relatives of mine within the vicinity.  On to checking out the Babycakes Cafe menu.  Lots of familiar breakfast choices.  Babycake pancakes, favorites, omelettes, benedicts, crepes, all kinds of good stuff!  We ended up ordering the Baby Chick omelette with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and cheddar cheese ($9.50), the Two-Egg Breakfast with two eggs, and hashbrowns ($6.25), and a short stack of their famous Red Velvet babycakes ($5.75).  Both of our orders each also came with two buttermilk babycakes included!  Not too shabby!    The food?  Delicious!  The omelette was fluffy and had a good amount of fillings, the eggs were cooked great (sunny side up..yum) and my hashbrowns were the way I like em'...super crunchy!  The babycakes were excellent as well, buttery and light.  But damn...those Red Velvet babycakes?  They were pretty bomb!  Topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips?  It was like having dessert for breakfast!  So savory!  Didn't even need the cream cheese syrup.  I will be sure to order a FULL stack of these next time!  And probably not share, ha ha!  Babycakes Cafe also has some stuff on the menu that is definitely Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian inspired.  These guys serve Spam!  Oh yeah!  The king of meats in Hawaii!  Definitely feelin' like I'm home.  Babycakes also has a Kalua Pig Benedict which definitely rings in the islands.  Don't forget Loco Moco!  It's made there too.  They serve Asian inspired Honey Toast!  Japan would be proud!  One of Babycakes biggest specialty sellers is Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  I wish I had ordered it because it looked so yummy!  Steaming hot with a side of macaroni salad included, all I needed was to top it off with ketchup, shoyu, and Tabasco.  Breakfast nirvana I say!  We'll be going here again soon.  Food was good, service was good, atmosphere is good.  I heard on the grapevine that the members of Jabbawockeez and Super Cr3w frequent Babycakes Cafe quite a bit and they love it!  I didn't see any of them in there the time we visited...but then again, how would I know what the Jabbawockeez guys look like without their white masks on?  Go here for a good breakfast!  It's the most important meal of the day!  If I remember correctly, the lady owner of Babycakes Cafe was super duper, mighty fine lookin', very pretty lady!  Friendly too.  Another reason to visit sooner!",

We each got the short stack.  The three cakes come with a dollop of whipped cream and a container of liquid cream cheese.  I thought I detected a slight vanilla flavor in the cream cheese.  It was divine!  There was also a sprinkling of mini chocolate pieces that melted from the warmth of the pancakes!  I had coffee and my friend had Coke.  Service was wonderful!  Our server had a great smile and was right on top of everything.  I had a coffee refill almost before I knew I wanted one.  I will be back to try some other items on the menu.  Being able to go on weekdays lessens the worry about waiting although we met at 8:30 and the place was almost filled - it is small - before 9.",

After that unnecessary outburst, I settled down and ordered the full stack of the Red velvet Pancake for $7.95. The full stack of the red color pancake had six red slices with mini chocolate chips, a thick cloud of whipped cream as the topping and two cups warm cream cheese syrup on the side.   My pancake: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=3ms4kj7wayMeLFKfxJpb1Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2I...</a>  I got to tell you that this cute little cafe is one-hour away from downtown Las Vegas; the red velvet pancake is definitely worth the drive. I have never had any pancake as good as this. The whipped cream is thick and the cream cheese syrup is very unique and adds the exciting taste.   This cafe is only open for breakfast and lunch. The cafe is also located west of the Las Vegas medical facility.   The one-hour drive is definitely worth it. And I might do it again and try the other flavored pancakes and American and Filipino cuisines.",

Sour Cream really made the difference!  Hash Browns and sourdough toast was \"Dennys\" quality.  Nothing special.  My wife had the Sweet cream crepes topped with strawberries. The Sweet cream filling was soupy. Strawberries must have been out of season cause I counted maybe a dozen slices of strawberries. Nothing special.  Would certainly go back for the omelet I had.",

I guess I had higher expectations due to reviews raving about it. The crab eggs benedict in Magnolia Cafe in San Antonio, TX is still the best for me. It's far though.   The HASH BROWNS that came with the eggs benedict is good. Had some weird tasting hash in some breakfast places in Vegas. This is what I remember a hash should be.   RED VELVET PANCAKE is awesome. Trumps any pancake I've eaten in my life. It's fluffy and moist, and has the right amount of sweetness. The portions are just right to fill me up. I give it 5 stars because their pancake is awesome. They trump any other breakfast place around town. (This doesn't exclude the high class breakfast places on the Strip, which I haven't tried yet.)  We'll be back again, but in their resto in Spring Valley. I think they're opening another branch, but I can't remember where. Hopefully it's close to where we live.",

They don't seat incomplete parties, and can be quite busy, so you may want to take that into account if you're going at a popular brunch time.   This was my first trip here, and luckily, I convinced my dad to split some sweet pancakes and a savory eggs benedict, so I got to try both! The coffee was good and the service was friendly- overall it was a good experience!  I would strongly recommend the Lemon Ricotta pancakes- they are closer to crepes than pancakes, light and lemony, with a delicious sweet cream cheese syrup. I sprinkled a bit of lemon on them as well, which added a bit of extra zest!  The Kalua Pig Benedict was okay- the pork was tender and flavorful, but the \"hollandaise\" sauce was closer to congealed and brought the dish down quite a bit. It wasn't terrible, but I would try something different next time.   Other dishes at our table included a skillet (looked delicious) and the red velvet pancakes, which were basically cake disguised as breakfast and well appreciated all around.",

I tell myself that I'm going to try one of the amazing looking pancakes, but every time I get there I remember the sweet smoky flavor of kahlua pork mingled with the warm egg yolk, rich hollandaise sauce, and crunchy shredded cabbage. I can't order anything else! My daughter has ordered the s'mores pancakes and I did get to taste those, which were heavenly. She has also ordered the spam sliders, but was disappointed to find out the spam was diced and cooked with egg and onion, instead of just spam slices. My parents have both tried different omelettes and have enjoyed them. The service is consistently attentive and the prices are reasonable. This is definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas.",

I think the food is on the right track, but the execution is lacking...  I was very reluctant to try the red velvet pancakes, since I thought they would be overly sweet, but they were delicious but could be more fluffy and and moist. Luckily the actual pancake wasn't too sweet so the whipped cream, chocolate chips and cream cheese sauce that topped it weren't too overpowering.  My omelette was cooked exactly as I requested and so were my potatoes.  Pleased with the experience overall. The waitstuff was friendly and efficient and the food came out in a timely fashion.  My only two major complaints were the long wait and less than welcoming hostess.  Those two things aside and this place might become a regular hangout for me if I can figure out when it's less busy, lol.",

    "text": "Weekdays are best. Expect to wait about 20-30 min on weekends but its worth it the food is great. Try the Strawberry Red Velvet pancakes. The last time I was there I had the \"Peanut Butter and ____\" pancakes. The 'blank' means you can chose what ever peanut butter partner you'd like from a selection of items. I had the PB & Bananas.   No anywhere as good as most of there items but it can be improved upon. The pancakes themselves where banana filled, but the PB was in the form of PB chips. As in choclate chips. They melted on the pancake eventually but you still have to kind of spread them on to the stack. That would have not been my first choice. Maybe a spread on the side or just spread some actually PB on the stacks. Maybe they do it for presentation?...  Either way they didn't taste as good as they sound.   The food is awesome and you can get some traditional Filipino and Hawaiian items as well. They have an extensive menu for pancakes and omeletts which are my favorite so you have plenty to chose from. Just be sure to order the half-stack if you're not hungry. The pancakes are about the size of your hand in diameter but they are very rich.   The four stars comes from the size and set-up of the establishment. Very very small and very limited seating for a place where you have to wait at least 20 minutes to be seated, longer if you're a bigger party. In the dead of summer or cold of winter you have to wait outside to be seated if the few seats that are inside are already taken. It's almost elbow to elbow inside and if you are private person there isn't anything you can really talk about without the folks at the next table being able to hear it.   Otherwise, this place seldom disappoints. I would definitely recommend you try it at least twice.",

In fact, been to both the North Buffalo and South Buffalo locations and never had a problem with the food or customer service.  Coming to the restaurant, it's always busy. Fair warning: they don't seat you unless your entire group is present. The hostesses are always friendly, and once you let them know that your entire group is on, you're all back on the list for the next available table.  I usually have the area with the lady that's got shoulder length hair with highlights, but this time the sister, cousin and I had a tatted guy with glasses. Gah... I really should start asking for names. Anyway... Cool, friendly server that constantly checked on us and gave us updates when we couldn't get the entire order out in one go. Didn't sweat it though 'cause we got our main plates, and the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia short stack was our dessert.  I also haven't found anything I didn't like on their menu.  The sister had gotten the Country Benedict, and that had awesome gravy! Super savory dish. The cousin had gotten the Kalua Pig Benedict, and that is always ono! I had gotte the Huntington Skillet, and I do like a kinda classic trifecta (bacon, eggs and potatoes), but I liked more with their pico and fresh avocado.",

    "text": "I have been here twice...and I'm glad I gave them a second try.  I love the unique pancakes this breakfast place offers.  Carrot cake pancakes, red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, and many more!  I was fortunate to try both the red velvet and carrot cake pancakes...YUM!  I had the Huntington Omelet both times (without the bacon) which had just cheese, avocado, and salsa served with country-style potatoes.  Good, but not extraordinary.  Coffee and OJ are average, but also good.  There are other unique items on their menu such as the adobo fried rice omelet (adobo fried rice wrapped in an \"egg burrito\") which my hubby liked.  Menu does not include many options for non-meat eaters (like myself), but there is a create-your-own omelet option.    Service was not really good the first time (I got my pancakes after I was almost done with my meal...my hubby got his pancakes with this meal), but the second time was better.  The owner even came around to check on us.  Tables are tiny (if ordering pancakes plus meal, the plates don't fit!) so it's almost better to go as a three-or more party to get a bigger table...or to ask for one of the high tables, which look a little bigger.    After the first visit, I was reluctant to try them again.  But thanks to some coaxing from a friend, I decided to give them another chance.  Although this is not my favorite breakfast place, I would still go back to try more of their unique pancake creations and to support a local Filipino business.   I'm hoping each time I try it, I'll like it better and rate it better.  For now...3 stars.",

    "text": "Read about this place on yelp (of course) and we were in the area, so we gave it a try.    The restaurant is shockingly small.  Be prepared to get up close and personal with your neighbors table. It's no wonder they have a reportedly long wait for tables, but we got in fairly quickly since we went more towards lunch time.  The husband asked for coffee while we waited, and the hostess was very accommodating.   I was pleasantly surprised to see Hawaiian foods featured on the menu.  This place has a large selection of pancakes, but also has sandwiches and salads and such if pancakes aren't your thing.  The husband got the portugese sausage with the garlic fried rice option and I got an omlet with a side of the famous red velvet pancakes.    The pancakes were as reported: awesome.  The omlet was just ok, as were the potatoes I got with them.  The sausage was ok too, but it would be pretty hard to screw up sausage.  The real disappointment for the both of us was the garlic fried rice.  Sounded so good in theory, but did not deliver.  There was too much garlic in it, and I love garlic.  Also, the rice was Uncle Bens.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to cater to Hawaiian transplants, you gotta come correct with the rice.  It has to be sticky calrose rice, not hard, dry Uncle Bens!    Overall, this place was decent.  If youre into pancakes, this is the place for you!",

Got the grilled cheese special with pork and the adobo fried rice omelet. It was all ok. Carrot pancakes had a nasty after taste and could only eat with the sauce. They might as well called the grilled cheese with pork a pork sandwich. It barely had any cheese and almost all pork. Not good at all! The only thing I kind of liked was the adobo fried rice but it doesn't even compare to aloha kitchen. Service was good. But I would not come back unless I was craving red velvet pancakes. I am not a morning person at all. But I would have preferred another place.",

The food is still as good as ever.   As you can read from previous reviews, the red velvet pancakes are far and away the most popular item.  Don't get me wrong, they're absolutely delicious, but I can only handle a few bites.  I always order them as a side and share them with my hubby.  I mean, come on you can't come here and not get the red velvet pancakes.  I have tried various menu items here with Babstacks providing all of your breakfast staples.  The eggs benedict is always pretty good, and I have been tempted to try the Kalua Prok benedict but haven't had a chance yet.  Rick's adobo fried rice is always a good choice with fried rice surrounded by a warm blanket of egg omelet.  Pour a little sriratcha on it and you are set.   The service is always pretty good here.  It can get very busy on Sundays when we usually go so be ready to wait (usual time for us is about 20-30 minutes).  But don't hesitate, it is worth the wait.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "I think the food at babystacks is very good but I have a big issue with the establishment. They won't seat you unless your entire party is there. I understand that this makes sense in case a person gets seated at a bigger table and then the rest of their party doesn't arrive until much later which could cause wait times to lengthen. However, sometimes people only have an hour lunch and if one of the party their meeting up with is able to go early and order everyone's food so it's on the table by the time everyone else gets there then what's wrong with that? All the food is being ordered at the same time! Especially for a small party of three which would not take a big table even if the rest of the party got held up and didn't show all the food would have still gotten paid for. Also, if your establishment is doing so well that you have to have this unpleasant policy bc of all the people that want to eat your food then get a bigger establishment. Babystacks is no hole in the wall even tourists go there. It would be a nice place for an afternoon brunch when family or out of town friends are here except that it is so small. I really like the food at this place but today they made me feel like they were too good to work with me and my situation. When I called the girl who answered the phone said it was the manager's call and when I asked to speak with the manager she said, \"Well he's busy if you wanna hold it would be awhile.\" Just disappointing service.",

    "text": "So much ado about nothing.  Could over 250 people who raved and ranted about how great Babycakes Cafe was be sadly mistaken?  You bet your sweet little buns they could!  After reading so many reviews from ecstatic foodies about how fantastic this restaurant was, I braved the over 18 miles drive to Babycakes to get some of their \"famous\" fare.  On a Saturday morning, we waited 50 minutes to be seated.  Hostess Lindy needed some serious lessons in customer service.  She called my name and motioned for me to follow her. She slapped the menu on the table and left without a word. Granting that it was a busy morning, a little courtesy would be much appreciated.  I guess, she was doing us a favor by giving us a seat in this unbelievably busy morning.  Waiter Preston was attentive and cheerful.  He was patient in answering my questions about the dishes and the restaurant operations in general.   Now on to the food recap.  I had the Portuguese sausage and two over easy eggs, paired with two small red velvet pancakes.  Nothing special with the sausage and eggs, no garnishing at all.  Eggworks' version of this dish was more acceptable. Anyway, really, how could you mess up commercially bought sausage and fried eggs?  The RVP - what's so special about red colored pancakes?  They were fluffy like the way pancakes should be.  The special sauce was simple condensed milk. If anything was added, it was beyond detection.  Verdict:  Entree was acceptable but nothing exceptional.  Hubby had the in\"famous\" adobe rice.  Since we were told the Filipino owner developed all the recipes, I was hopeful I would be enjoying some nasty good adobo rice.  Since I read the reviews I knew that it would be served wrapped in scrambled egg like an omelet.  Japanese often serve omelets in this fashion so I did not find it strange.  After the first bite, it was clear I was headed for disastrous disappointment. The adobe, which I assumed was pork, was shredded and did not taste anything like Filipino adobo. It looked and tasted like reincarnated kalua pig mixed with soy sauce and nothing else.  What a shame to call this dish \"adobe rice\".  It was clearly a misnomer. Verdict:  Entree was crap and an utter waste of money.  Conclusion:  There was so much hype about this restaurant.  It was not worth the drive and definitely not worth a second trip.",

Furthermore, no lattes, cappucino or espresso! BOO! Our eggs were so overcooked they were essentially hard boiled.  For a breakfast place, screwing up the eggs and coffee is sort of a big deal!  Pros:The hollandaise sauce is dreamy.  The kahlua pig benedict was excellent except for the above mentioned eggs.  The prices are fair. $50 for 4 breakfasts and 4 coffees. The red velvet pancakes were excellent and surprisingly not too sweet.  We also ordered a huntington omelette, and spinach benedict.  Omelette was o.k. Nothing special; on the dry side. Eggs were overcooked on this benedict as well.    Service was o.k. We had to flag her down to take our order but she did keep our coffee full without asking. We waited 30 mins. to be seated at 10:30 on a Friday morning.    I'm willing to try them again but right now not so impressed.",

    "text": "Okay okay, I can feel the backlash already.   But after all the hype about this place, I'm far from being impressed. But yet again, I'm not one to drive into hype.   First off, why drive away customers with a sign that exposes a 60 minute wait time when you have a bunch of empty tables waiting to seat hungry patrons? and when we only ended up waiting about 25 minutes (as was everyone else in front of us and behind us), I automatically felt pretty bad at their potential loss of business for those that left because they didn't want to wait \"60 minutes\". I mean cmon now, this isn't Disneyland. Or maybe it is because one of the waiter's were obviously friends with a party that came in and went straight in to be seated. Fast Pass. Nice. But hey, it was only a 25 minute wait, so I can't complain.   Now on to food.   Cuz this is what so many of my friends hyped about.   I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Okay. Folks- save yourselves and just head on over to Aloha Kitchen or Island Flavor. Now they know how to do it right. If you can't make your adobo correctly and expect to throw it into some fried rice and covered with a thin layer of egg- then don't even bother. Learn how to make adobo first- then try and throw it into an \"omelette\".   Boyfriend had the Loco Moco. Please, don't even get me started. Even him- not being from Hawaii- was highly disappointed. Gravy was bland and so was the hamburger patty. Which meant-- no flavor whatsoever. Cmon folks. Get it together.   And now...drum roll please...  The pancakes.   Macadamia Pancakes.   Tasted like generic, boxed pancake batter. Not mixed correctly with proper measurement of liquids because it was dense beyond belief. Really? Pancake sticking to the roof of your mouth? What the? And I wouldn't even have known it was macadamia nut pancakes if I hadn't read it myself. The white chocolate chips on it was the only other flavor aside from \"batter\" that you can taste.   RED VELVET PANCAKES:  Strike me now babycake fans.   Last time I knew-- red velvet pancakes is a touch of cocoa and chocolate. It shouldn't taste like CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES. Granted, chocolate chip pancakes are delicious (elsewhere-idk about here), but to have chewy and dense red velvet pancakes that don't taste like it? Not acceptable.   So now, I'm going to leave my little experience to an anomalous fluke because people seem to love it here and their red velvet pancakes. So maybe I just came in when they just weren't up to par. But I gotta review as I see and experience it.   Will I go back? Maybe.",

Red Velvet Pancakes (Yum!!) - These pancakes are nice and light. Not too heavy. Very flavorful but not too rich where you feel like you would need to drink a gallon of milk. To top off this wonderful dish it comes with a whipped light cream cheese syrup and mini chocolate chips.             2.) Loco Moco - ( Oh ma gawd!) - This amazing dish is made up of steamed rice, an all beef patty, and eggs served any way with brown gravy on top. So magical. All the flavors blended together very well. The only thing I don't like about this dish is the macaroni salad that comes with it. No flavor. Maybe you could substitute the salad with some fruit?                                                                                                                              3.)

It comes with a scrambled egg, sausage or bacon, hash browns (which is enough for my daughter and I to share) and 1 baby stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Baby stacks is known for their gourmet style pancakes. They have several different options to choose from such as s'more, lemon ricotta, carrot cake, Rocky road, cinnabon, and bacon. If I could ever get out of my comfort zone, step out of the box and try something new, I would like to try these other pancakes. They sound wonderful! I will also need to try the Kaluha pig Benedict or spinach Benedict. I hear these dishes are tasty as well?   Baby stacks has two locations. I live closer to this location (smoke ranch) but I think the one off of Flamingo is bigger? You definitely want to get to either location early because there can be somewhat of a wait. I am a fan though and find myself going at least 1-2 times a month.",

Skillets are awesome, omelettes are great, and the Eggs Benedict options are out of sight (best hollandaise I've had).   Vegas appears to have an odd approach to breakfast (later openings, no diners to be found?!?)  - at least, it did for us NYers. If you find yourself in a similar predicament, go here. You will be delighted.  If we come back to the area, we'll definitely be back to Babystacks.",

    "text": "All I've heard about in terms of bangin breakfast has been Babycakes Cafe. The hoopla has been mainly about their red velvet pancakes, and since red velvet is my most favorite dessert, how could I pass up an opportunity to try it in breakfast form?   From my understanding, the line to get in to this joint is typically outrageous, but little secret..on a Tuesday morning around 11AM, you'll have virtually no problem finding a seat in this strip mall hidden treasure.   The restaurant itself is small which would explain the (typical) wait time to get a table. I have reduced my rating by a star due to this fact because the seating is awkward, the restaurant can be noisy and most seats in the house will have you facing the kitchen or hallway to the restroom.   Moving right along.. The other half ordered some garlic infused omelet (I'm Italian, but garlic in the AM is just too much for me) complete with potatoes and a side of red velvet pancakes and I ordered their cinnamon bun pancakes and a side of scrambled eggs.   Much to my surprise I quite enjoyed my cinnamon pancakes even better than the red velvet! But hey, if you forced me to eat either one, I wouldn't complain.   All in all, food was delicious, service was great and should I ever be in the area again and there's not a line, I would happily indulge once again in the Babycakes extensive, festively flavored pancake menu.",

I was glad to experience this place on a weekday when there isn't a 3 hour wait. The restaurant is small so it is a little awkward that you can see everything from the runner station especially if you sit right by it. Food execution is great & the service is good so I give it two thumbs up!",

Their menu consists of traditional American favorites along with Fillipino and Hawaiian delights.  The place is really small and on the weekends, the wait is anywhere between 30 to 60 minutes long.   The service is wonderful and is owned by a local family and not some huge chain, which I love seeing in Vegas. They know regulars by name.  My favorite thing is the fun pancakes they serve: s'mores, red velvet, German chocolate... the list goes on people.  They also have daily specials.  Definitely worth the trip and the wait if you're not in the area and not in any rush (especially on the weekends).",

Reading reviews I know the place is small and gets busy so I got there right at 7am on a Saturday.  I was the second group to be seated.  Within 30 minutes the whole place was filled up and a line was forming.  I was shocked on how fast that happened.    Since I really came for the red velvet pancakes, that's what I ordered, short stack and a side of sausage patties.  The RV pancakes were delicious and so filling!!!  I wasn't to fond of syrup stuff they give, its just to sweet for me.  I mean the whole platter is a sugar high but I just couldn't do the syrup.  I would rather have regular syrup, next time.  The pancakes were good enough that really the syrup wasn't needed.  I only hate half the pancakes and took the rest home.  Seriously the short stack was just to much, haha.  The sausage patties were really good and I enjoyed them.    The service was great and they were on top of checking up on me, filling my water, etc...  I definitely want to come back again and try some of the other stuff on the menu.  I do know though, its a place to get to first thing because I am hungry when I wake up and get grumpy without food, haha.",

That makes me SOOO disappointed, because they have a great restaurant, but some of their staff is ruining it for customers  :(  ****ASK FOR ANOTHER WAITRESS if you get \"FELICIA\" (Phyllicia)****  I was beyond frustrated with that waitress' attitude when she put her friends (2 people she knows) ahead of  ***SIX***  groups of people who were patiently waiting for the next available table.  It was appalling that when I asked a male waiter why she let them cut in front of everyone, both him and Felicia (Phylicia) **LAUGHED** and did not take the customers' concern seriously.  I was polite when I asked about the situation, but their attitude back towards me was rather rude.  Finally (after much debate), she told her friends they had to leave (since they clearly were skipping the line ahead of all those people waiting and they didn't even have a reservation).  However, she continued to give mean looks to myself and other customers who complained to her about this unfair situation, while we were finally seated and eating our meal.  Very poor service.  So again.... do yourself a favor... if Felicia (Phyllicia) is still working there, then ask for another waitress.  She is absolutely rude to customers and it's not worth the hassle.",

In fact, I have yet to encounter a pancake that didn't make me swoon.  The non pancake dishes and even the coffee are whatevs, but the pancakes are reason enough for me to return again and again.  Carrot cake and Red Velvet are my favorites on their regular menu, but keep an eye out for their seasonal specials because THOSE are spectacular, particularly the pumpkin pancakes... yummo!   I am glad I only live around the corner, because the wait times on the weekends are ridiculous.  I have done it once and learned my lesson. (Boy, was I grumpy!) Weekday brunch dates when my husband rolls into work after noon are wait free!  Stick to the pancakes and you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "We'd passed this place at least a dozen times and always remarked how we should try it -- and finally we did on Easter weekend.  It  was much smaller than we thought inside -- but not too crowded. Cozy, I'd call it.  But there are no booths, it's all table seating.  The staff was really nice and attentive as they could be considering it was pretty busy. We walked in around 10:30 on a Saturday morning, but we must've gotten lucky, because despite her saying it would be 20-25 minutes, we were seated within 5 minutes. Not too shabby.  I ordered the Mexican Omelette with buttermilk pancakes instead of toast.  The omelette was delicious -- could've been a little spicier or maybe had another elements, like pico de gallo, but I just hit it with some Tabasco and all was well. Delicious carnitas, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and topped with sour cream. Yum. I'd order it again, for sure.  I'm kind of picky about my pancakes. So many places make them heavy or dense or way, way, WAY too big. I don't need silver dollars, but I prefer them smaller than my face.  These are the exact right size, especially to accompany eggs.  I wanted to try the red velvet pancakes everyone raves about. The guy at the table across from us ordered them and they looked amazing.  Babystacks lets you get a specialty pancake instead of just buttermilk in lieu of toast, but I figured if this is a breakfast joint that specializes in pancakes, I should start with the basics. If their buttermilk pancakes are good, the rest probably are, too.  And they were good! I ate them both and ended up bringing home most of my omelette.  Next time, I'd like to try the lemon ricotta stacks or the red velvet. There are really so many to choose from, though i'm not much of a dessert-for-breakfast type of girl, so I likely won't try them all.  But I'll definitely be back -- it was comparably priced with places like Cracked Egg just up the street.  And while I love Cracked Egg, Babystacks will provide a nice alternative, especially when I really want pancakes.",

    "text": "While visiting Las Vegas we wanted to desperately  escape the overpriced low-quality  food from the hotels on the strip. Thank you Yelpers for your help  finding this jewel! We arrived 30 min before closing and we were welcomed as if they just opened their doors.  Our server Jacob made some suggestions since this was our first time here and  we were not familiar with the menu. I had the special: short ribs, two eggs, garlic rice and for the perfect ending German cake pancakes. Hubby ordered the pork egg Benedict. Oh boy...what a breakfast!! Food came out super quick. Everything was delicious, cooked to perfection, the ribs were unbelievable.  Tender, juicy...could have been a rib eye. That good!! Thanks again to Jacob for this suggestion and for keeping my cup of coffee full at all times.  He was very attentive. The pancakes...ufff....to die for. I can't describe it...just have them.",

I asked her if she'd like to see the order. she gave me a hasty \"NO\" So i start reading the order out to her and while i was in mid sentence she interrupts to ask me how i want the steak cooked. Which would have been FINE if she let me end my statement. I ask her if its necessary to interrupt me while i'm speaking and she says \"don't yell at me.\" its a loud cafe! i wasn't \"YELLING\"   I then give her the second Item which she had me repeat because she didn't hear me, this was a hamburger by the way. i give her the last item... and the ticket is done. She said it would be ready in 15 minutes. 15 minutes pass... she shows me the food. and i ask where the hamburger is. She claims I \"never ordered\" one. I retell her of how i repeated my self earlier. She replies that she had read back the order to me sans hamburger and i okayed it. I pushed back a bnit and said \"did you really? are you absolutely certain you read it back to me?\" She then said \"do you want to speak to the manager?\" I said \"absolutely\"  The Manager comes over and tells me the hostess had said I \"wanted to cancel the entire ticket and get a refund.\" I explained that this was unTrue as all i wanted was the missing item to be included. I also asked if it was necessary for the hostess to be condescending. I got no answer and the Manager fixed the ticket. 8 minutes later i got the hamburger.  it was completely unnecessary to go through all of that. if the hostess would have just added the hamburger and not attempt to shift blame onto the customer this all could have been avoided. won't ever eat there again.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  Inspired by a meeting with my husband's relatives on their quick visit (that was so nice to see them) recently for breakfast at the Blueberry Hill (yum!) on Flamingo/Tamarus, I wanted to go out for breakfast on my birthday (a few days ago) and scoped out a few places (1) thanks to Yelp, (2) remembered this place, a few months back, from a benefit segment on the news and (3) may have heard about their best seller, Red Velvet Pancakes from a local radio show hostess (we hardly go out for breakfast, but I miss it). I am always checking out menus (but changed my mind on my choice---this menu has a ton of options) and since I'm on a restricted diet, look forward to eating a little more freely on my cheat days.   This is located in a small strip mall, corner pocket, and is a bit small, but it feels cozy and it is clean---turnaround time is fast because this is a popular breakfast spot (counted about 13 tables, booth and table/chair combos, with the booth side against the walls); not quite, a hole-in-the-wall. My son noticed the giant butterflies on the wall, by stating \"Big bugs!\" There were two tv's on opposite ends of the L-shaped restaurant. When we arrived, it was quiet, and many tables were empty. By the time we left, there was only one empty table, two tables if you count ours. When you walk in, there is the cashier (where you pay), and  the menu is posted on the wall at eye-level height (for me anyway, I'm short).   Our server was Monica, and she was super sweet, outgoing, and helpful (suggestions) when we had questions about the menu. She was also pretty attentive, checking on us many times.   My husband got the german chocolate pancakes, the full stack. It was huge! It looked really decadent and more like a dessert. I had one, the little guy had half of one, and we took one and a half to-go. It was really good, light and fluffy, but very sweet (caramel sauce), so it's not something I would get (I don't have a sweet tooth). My husband loves his pancakes, but when we go again, said he would get the short stack with a side of something salty, sausage or something. Even the guy next to him (got the build your own omelet) was looking at it when it was brought to our table. I got the biscuits and gravy with two sausage links, and it came with my choice of potatoes, I got them seasoned. The gravy was very good, and the biscuits were soft (four). Little man liked the sausage and potatoes. I was going to get the adobo fried rice (that was my 1st choice), but opted for a less heavy item because lunch was going to be AYCE sushi, and I really didn't want to spoil my lunch (balance). I really enjoyed the hot chocolate, sprinkled with bits of chocolate (didn't melt), mmm. I would definitely get that again. It was full of flavor, not watered down, and most likely the best cup of hot chocolate I ever had, and when I told my husband, he said \"You downed it quick, someone didn't even offer me a sip\" My oops. If we go to a new place, I try to check out other people's food (but I'm not a neck-stretcher), to see how they look, and also portion size. Someone next to us got the red velvet pancakes and they looked decadent.   I will definitely try something different next time. Hubby said we could always go out for breakfast and eat in for lunch or dinner, just to switch it off, and that way we could enjoy breakfast out sometime (he is the breakfast maker in our home).   There are four locations, two on the west side (summerlin, spring valley), one in the centennial area, and henderson.   To reiterate, a popular breakfast spot (all the reviews on Yelp, c'mon!), nice staff/very good service, great food, and definitely one place to meet out of town guests for breakfast.",

The menu has a wide variety and there is something for everyone in it. I had the country fried steak and eggs and I upgraded to the garlic fried rice. My other half ordered the corned beef hash and eggs and upgraded his order of buttermilk pancakes to the Banana Foster pancakes. The food was plentiful and soooooooo delicious! Our server Maria provided excellent service and our food came out quickly.  The restaurant is located on the corner of Smoke Ranch and Buffalo right next to Sierra Gold. If you're in the neighborhood, I definitely suggest that you stop here for breakfast!",

Let me address the 4-star vs 5-star rating: It wasn't a bad place. I took one star away because some of the dishes were seasoned a little too lightly. Maybe that's their style, which is fine, but it's not my preference.   Now, on to the food - BEST PANCAKES I'VE HAD. For that, I applaud you guys. I ate their two days in a row - once with my brother and once with my dad. One day I had the Kalua Benedict. It was good, but a little bland. Also ate the Tiramisu baby stack which was BOMB DIGGITY.  The next day I had the breakfast burrito, which was a solid burrito. I also ordered the Hazlenut pancakes. They were a little dry; not the pancakes themselves but the overall dish. Overall it was a good plate (or plates) of food.  THe staff was kind and very attentive. We had them play musical chairs quite a bit with our stroller and high chairs, but they were awesome the whole time. I'd go again, and I'd invite people there.",

Strawberry short stack and a Cinnabon BabyStacks. Very good food!! Even my daughter stated 5 stars and she's picky with seasoning and texture of food.

Ever since I found the place, hubby knows that I will be making at least one visit to the place before we leave Vegas!  I come here mainly for the signature pancakes .. bananas fosters!   It's so good that I can bring myself to try any other flavors.  Mini me loves their red velvet pancakes there too. We don't even attempt to try each other's pancakes either we are so stuck on what we like LOL.   The coffee is not great very watered down but I mainly come here for the pancake and some eggs and bacon.  The Filipino adobo and spam and eggs are good too.  They don't really do substitutions so be prepared if you are trying to cut calories.  Other than that I recommend the pancakes here and they are very affordable and also the place is small and gets very busy but they are worth the wait.",

    "text": "The food is delicious but some of the staff is rude. It's Monday morning and there's not that many people here, but we have to wait 25 minutes because they put all the two person parties at the 4 person tables and all that is available is 2 person tables.. and they won't hold our place on the list if we leave to go do something while we wait for 25 minutes because they don't know how to seat people in their restaurant. The biggest issue here is that i am an asshole, but they could do a better job. Lots of other good places doing it right around here.  Update: We let them know our frustration and they offered us a discount for our troubles the time before when we were removed from the waiting list for not waiting in their designated area. Still disagree with the way they do their waiting list but I appreciate them trying to make up for shortcomings. And again, the food is always 5 stars delicious.",

    "text": "This place is SMALL and BUSY - which was a pretty good indication I'd probably like it.  Well, all I can say is that my son REALLY liked the oatmeal - other than that, it was passable, not something I'd rave about.  There's better breakfast spots in Vegas, TRUST me on that one...usually longer wait to be seated too elsewhere, but this place was okay.    I was really hoping for fantastic pancakes, but as a side, not so much.  Mine were dry, flat not fluffy, and barely warm enough to melt the butter, with very little flavor.  Perhaps if that was the base for something more decadent as on the menu, then I might have liked them more.  When you try a place that has \"cakes\" in the name for breakfast, you'd think the pan\"cakes\" would be the star of the show.  Not to me, and not to my son either.  The portion sizes were average, which is good to me since I didn't have any left overs, and I also wasn't left feeling like \"that's it?\" - for the prices, it was competitive with other similar type places.  I'd probably opt to say this wouldn't be where I'd choose for breakfast over other locations in the area.  Service was the best part of the meal, but I honestly felt very cramped being stuck right next to the server table thing.  I looked around, and there wasn't many other options for seating that weren't as cramped too.  I'd be more inclined to call in a to go order instead here!",

The Kalbi was tender and the flavors would have had mothers everywhere dodging slaps! Yes I said it, my breakfast was slap ANYBODY'S mama good!   Last and more than mentionable, I took home the Nutella crepes for my kids to try being they were not invited. Long story short! These crepes were much too good for children! They were slamming! The Nutella was so creamy and rich, the crepe was cooked to perfection, and the bananas were the perfect match! Let's just say maybe next time Kids! *wipes Nutella from cheek*  This is a great place to meet with friends and also take your family for a good meal! Get there early they close at 2!",

While I understand there is normally a wait for a table I do not understand while the hostess Adrianna would think it was ok to sit a party before us that came in later than we did. Here's how the excuse that the wait list is different than the lobby wait(??) Yeah, I dont understand that one either. When I asked for the manager you could tell she had that panicked moment.  The manager Jamie said she already knew what the complaint was but how could she? I hadn't said anything other than I wanted to speak to a manager. So obviously the hostess knew what she had done, she lied about it and tried to insult my intelligence by doing so. Very poor customer service and to top it all off the banana cream pancakes were bland. Btw I didn't want the 10 percent discount I dont have a problem paying full price for good customer service.  I can forgive everything but bad customer service.  I dont know if I will return to Babystacks.",

There is always a wait as the restaurant is pretty small, but if you're a party of two, it seems easier to be seated quickly. Be prepared, though, you may be sitting REALLY close to people at the next table. I hate this, but for such an awesome breakfast, I'll sacrifice.  I am not a pancake eater- I'm an egg & meat lover, but I just *had* to try the red velvet stacks. BabyStacks allows you to add their specialty stacks to your egg order, so I ordered a skillet (always my breakfast favorite) and added the red velvet pancakes.   The red velvet pancakes are not too thick, not too thin, sprinkled with mini chocolate chips and a generous dollop of whipped cream. The cream cheese syrup is to die for - it just totally reminds me Nothing Bundt Cake frosting! It's like eating chocolate cake for breakfast, which may gross some people out, but for a chocolate lover it's sinfully delightful.  The skillet was one of the better skillets I've had in Vegas. They layer potatoes, cheese, and any omelet choices and top them off with eggs any style. I ordered my skillet with onion, tomaotes, spinach, cheddar cheese and sausage. It was gigantic, could barely finish half, but so full of flavor. The tomatoes were very sweet - just the way I like them.  Next trip: carrot cakes with cream cheese syrup!",

The second time we went, which was just this morning, we had our same server and hostess! I loved that. They are both super smiley and welcoming. My boyfriend got the same as before and this time, I got the \"make your own skillet\" with carrot cake pancakes. I almost ate all of my pancakes before I even started on the skillet which had mushrooms, onions, and green bell peppers over potatoes with melted cheese. I chose cheddar and got scrambled eggs. With some cholula drizzled on top, I was in heaven. I enjoyed every bite and every bit of service :P they rock! We will definitely be going back soon. :)",

Like 30 different kinds and flavors, and they're small so your group could get multiple flavors to try and share. Red Velvet, cookies and cream, classic chocolate chip, and S'more are some of my favorites. Additionally, some of the dishes are influenced by Filipino island flavors, like Rick's adobo fried rice \"omelette\" and the Kahlua pig Benedict--the bomb! Not a ton of seating, and it's a popular place so expect a little wait, but it's totally worth it. My favorite place to eat in Vegas.",

I've tried other pancakes here, but the red velvet are the best BY FAR. They even come with a side of cream cheese syrup. It's like having dessert for breakfast! The adobo fried rice comes wrapped in an omelet and is awesome!  I've also tried the spinach eggs benedict which is very tasty. It comes with a side of buttery hash browns. I will definitely be tryng the kalua pork benedict next time. The spam scramble sounded interesting, but was nothing special. The french toast is also not very good.

    "text": "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! So might as well make it the best too.  I came here a few days ago with a friend and the place was packed, waited about 30 minutes to get seated, but it was worth the wait. Once we we got seated we got immidiate service, our coffee was brought to us faster than we could order it.   I looked at the menu for a good minute since everything looked delicious, i am a simple girl and dont like having to choose between so many awesone choices. Why cant i just choose them all?!  Anywho, i ordered the red velvet pancakes(short stack) and 3 beautifully sized, fluffy red pancakes arrived in less than 10 minutes(now i remind you that i waited an extra 40 minutes to eat, so i was starving)  and my friend ordered cookie butter french toast.  About my pancakes: WHAT THE H*** WERE THESE THINGS MADE OUT OF? CRACK? I didnt eat the pancakes, i inhaled them. They were so good! I wanted more when i was done(even though i was about to explode) and still to this day i am craving them.   French toast: i tried some of my friends and it was delicious as well. If i wasnt so stuffed from my pancakes i probably would of inhaled them too while my friend was in the bathroom.   I definetly recommend this place. The food wasnt the only thing that was outstanding, the service was as well.",

My mother came in an hour before they closed and they Absolutely had no wait and she needed a table for 2, yet they wouldn't seat her until I have arrive. She mentioned she was even ready to order, but they still made her wait with empty tables in the dining room.  How are you going to make an elder women wait and not let her sit and ORDER?! Party of 1 or 2 she will still be sat at a table for two anyways?!  RIDICULOUS. I even called the manage and said she's ready to order can you please seat and her they said they'll \"TRY\" to work something out.  I arrive and no one has even spoke to my mother. Not only did the manger lie to me on the phone, but they won't even seat a guest with empty tables in the dining room. Never going back to this location.",

    "text": "decided to make Babycakes part of my NYE festivities since i was going to be in the north part of Vegas most of the day.  Besides, I have a couple Groupons to use.  So gf and i originally decide let's hit it before we go to Aliante to sign up for nye bingo and pick up tickets for the Journey cover band playing post-bingo at Aliante.  When we get to Babycakes, big surprise, the place is packed - 45 minute wait. We put our name in and take the chance to drive to Aliante and return in time for brekafast.  It did take 45 minutes but they already called our name - we did call them to ask that they move our name lower - they refused ...bummer.  so we get back t Babycakes - another 30 minutes .  We order the Rick's adobo rice , the pork bennie and we dshared a small stack of the red velevet pancakes.  Service was good - timely refills, food came out reasonably fast.  The food ?  mixed bag - the gf's adobo rice - i didn't notice on the menu - it's an omelet filled with fried rice.  I like the creativity but didn't quite get there on taste - i kinda laughed since it reminded me of an occasional sunday breakfast for me - take your leftovers from the night before and jam it into an omelet.  The pancakes were tasty - didn't need the whipped cream - again, a creative dish.  the pork bennie  - again, i like the creativity and i did like the saltiness of the pork mixed with the egg but it definitely needed more bernaise sauce  and the potatoes ??  for such a creative menu, the potatoes SUCKED !   I have another groupon so i'm sure i'll hit  Babycakes again but not sure if it's travel worthy.",

I kept blabbing about the red velvet pancakes to my girl and  convinced her that it was worth a try (she's not much of a foodie.. yet!)   Got here before noon and was seated right away. I couldn't help notice this lady that was seated right next to me. She looked so familiar.. Well, it was my first invited friend on Yelp! She provides some of the most interesting reviews: Blair B.! Hi Blair! And Megan S., nice meeting you as well! What a small world..  The Belly Pleasers:  Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: Came neatly plated, corned beef was the typical canned stuff but for being canned, it was satisfying. I must note that I do prefer the real stuff (shredded/chunky) but their stuff did have a slight advantage over almost identical looking corned beef I've eaten at other places before. There maybe something with the oil the cook it in or some special seasoning they throw on there?! I also decided to try their seasoned potatoes. They looked plain but once again, they were tastier than I expected. Results, Nothing over the top but I was happily filled up!  *Chicken Fried Steak with Hash, still Reigns Supreme!  Carrot Pancakes: I wanted to try something different, since my girl ordered the obvious red velvet pancakes that she wasn't gonna finish and scoot over my way anyways.. The carrot pancakes came with the same cream cheese syrup, nuts sprkinkled on top, had the same texture as the velvets and tasted good, borderline great.. BUT in no way compared to the Red Velvet Pancakes!!  Red Velvet Pancakes: my girl ordered the short stack (3 pieces). She took a few bites but didn't really express her emotions much but I could tell by her facial reactions that it was captivating! She finished more than half the order, more than I expected and said \"they were delicious! I really liked the little sprinkled mini chocolate chips and the whipped cream\".. Another happy customer :)..   Round 2: Everything was pretty much as Great as the 1st Time!",

Although, I'm sure you can it'll jus be a longer wait.   I ordered the Kalua pig Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the adobo omelette. And together we ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes as a dessert. That's how we get to try a little bit of every goodness. The kalua Benedict was perfect the way it was made. The yoke breaking over the meat and the crispy edges of the meat added a smokey hint to it. I tried some of the adobo omelet and it was good, but I've had bigger for the same price at aloha kitchen. On the other hand, the macaroni salad that came with it was unique with it's hint of crab meat. The red velvet pancakes was the perfect puzzle piece for my belly's satisfaction with it's sweet cream cheese syrup.   The service was on point and friendly. The parking is plenty. Be aware, it's disguised in an industrial area.  I am most certainly filled and ready to come back to try the s'more pancakes.",

Very rarely, however, have had moment where tasting food left me speechless for a full five minutes.   That is exactly what happened when I tasted the red velvet pancakes at Babycakes Cafe. There is absolutely no way 5 stars does them justice. They are heaven personified in a pancake.   The other food I tasted was exceptional as well. The eggs, hashbrowns and bacon I had were cooked right to order and very fresh. The person I went with tried one of the Benedict options, and it was quite tasty too with homemade hollandaise. I also sampled the honey whole wheat pancakes and they were marvelous. Their secret is entirely homemade pancake batters, and the work pays off.   Service was satisfactory; we were always greeted with a smile by every employee we came across and the food came out quickly despite being quite busy at the cafe.   This place is well worth the drive from where I live in the University area, and I will be back.",

Upon driving up to this place you can already see groups of people waiting outside so you must know that this restaurant is good.   I had their Kalua Pig Benedict which I enjoyed a lot. I would recommend this dish to anyone who likes egg benedict.   My boyfriend had their Portuguese Sausage and Eggs and it was okay, don't think he'll get it again as the sausages were just sausages, nothing really stood out with this dish. The garlic rice that he order had too much garlic in it as well. Will not recommend this dish to anyone.   Tried a few pieces of their Red Velvet Pancakes and it was good, little too sweet for me, but no complaints here.   Also tried their Buttermilk Pancakes and again it tastes like pancakes to me. Honestly I can see why people would stand for over an hour to eat here, this please is pretty good, but next time I'm in town I would just pick up the phone and order, lesson learned. =]",

However, the service and the food were lackluster at best.  Being seated on a Wednesday afternoon, my brother and I were fully expecting to evade the normal rush. However, this didn't stop service from being inattentive and practically non-existent. Sitting for a few minutes without being acknowledged at our table, another waitress noticed our unsettled behavior, and quickly made amends with service. Normally, I'd understand a wait, but Babycakes has about 15 tables throughout the restaurant. Small is an understatement, and in this, I didn't understand the neglectful service we received. I felt more attended to by our neighboring table's child than by the wait staff.   My brother and I shared the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and the adobo fried rice. The adobo fried rice was nothing special - other than surprising me in being wrapped in an omelet. The Lemon Ricotta pancakes were the biggest disappointment. I fully expected lemony, fluffy crepes; however, what was placed on my table were dry, bland crepes. Nowhere could I identify an ounce of ricotta, and the only lemon throughout was squeezed on myself.   The price is decent for the portions we got, but the taste isn't justified for that price. Overall, for such an adorable concept, I was disappointed by the lack of service and lack of flavor.",

The food here is astonishingly unique, fresh and tasty. We split an order of the red velvet pancakes and an order of Rick's Adobe Fried Rice (a Filipino dish) and the combo of sweet and savory was heavenly.

    "text": "Super cute little breakfast/brunch joint with a pretty unique menu - not your standard generic breakfast. I was excited to try the red velvet pancakes, which did live up to the hype. They're so pretty and fluffy with great flavor. Even just a half stack is more than enough, I think the full would've been too much of a good thing. Wheat French toast kind of looks more like pork chops in my pic, but its actually thick slabs of bread dipped in a corn flake crust for a really different texture. I was excited to try their French toast based on the description, but it was a little dry and overwhelmingly sweet to me. I ended up just having 1 piece.  I didn't try my friend's strawberry crepe, but presentation was pretty. Service was surprisingly bad despite it being pretty slow. I'm always a little shocked when little homey restaurants like this don't provide good service. There were maybe 10 tables max with 2 or 3 servers working. The waitress was sweet and nice, but I almost had to beg her for a 3rd place setting. We also ceased to exist once the food came, had to beg again for a refill of their watered down coffee. Tried unsuccessfully twice to flag her down to pay the bill, only to be told that she didn't do that - we had to pay up front.  I really wanted to love this place because it was so cute, but I don't think ill be back. Just have to be on the lookout for another place w red velvet pancakes.",

I agree with everyone else that the pancakes are very good, but my daughter was the only smart one.  She ordered Banana Nut pancakes, yum!! I ordered the sausage and eggs and I wasn't impressed.  I asked for over medium eggs and I got less than over easy eggs.  I'm kind of wondering if they were cooked at all.  They didn't have much flavor either and they just ended up being a soupy mess on my plate.  My husband ordered the Kahuna Pig eggs benedict and was not impressed either.  I'm dissappointed as I had high hopes for this place. If you want just pancakes, this place is probably the best, but everything else we tried was no good! Back to Jamm's we go.",

I got an omelette, I forget what it was called, but it had avocado and bacon and cheese.  It was good!  It was a perfect portion for me.  The Cracked Egg has a much bigger portion but I end up with leftovers all the time anyway.  However, I am also a very small person.  I loved that it only cost a couple dollars extra to upgrade my pancakes from plain buttermilk to the.. of course.. RED VELVET PANCAKES.  Lol!  They were definitely good and pleasing and different however... just like my overall opinion of this place... nothing to go out of my way for.  The service was attentive, and the place was very small.  I went on a weekday morning so there was no wait but I can't imagine on a weekend morning!  Was pleased and will go back, but nothing I can see myself craving.",

I ordered the Huntington Omelette-  the omelette kinda sucked- the avocado on top was not ripe and the cheese had no flavor. The hash browns which we ordered extra crispy were only half cooked (hate to see how they would have been otherwise).   I did not bother to take more than 4 or 5 bites. I did order the Red Velvet Pancakes-  they deserved 4 stars! They were very good.     My husband ordered  the corned beef hash which he said  was \"nothing to write about.  He thought it tasted very bland & almost canned although the menu states it was home made.  He was also disappointed in the hash browns.  He ordered the Smores pancakes.  He liked them-I found them way too sweet. .   Service was quick and our server was pleasant.",

    "text": "To be honest I had no idea about how AWESOME of a place this cafe is. If you're a fan of AMAZING breakfast options I highly recommend you check this place out. I had the pleasure of coming here for a Book Club meet up. We are a group of Sci Fi/ Fantasy readers who are female food lovers. Our fearless leader set up this Brunch and let me tell you I was really impressed. Upon entering the parking lot the place didn't look too special but I could see lots of people waiting for a table. I was running late as USUAL so once I entered we had already been seated. Our  server Jacob was prompt at greeting me politely with a smile and asking what he could get me to drink while he went to grab me a menu.  I literally opened it up expecting to go with my normal go to breakfast choice when I was #MINDBLOWN. They have so many different options from Red Velvet Pancakes to these awesome fancy eggs benedict dishes. I had a really hard time deciding what to go with but I couldn't help but wanting  try the Fried Rice Stuffed Omelet. I however didn't trust myself to just impulsively go with my gut choice without asking Jacob what his thoughts were on the dish.  He smiled that bright smile and stated it was DELICIOUS and one of the most popular dishes. Let me tell you he was RIGHT!  about 3 of the 8 ladies went with the fancy eggs benedict varietes another got a crepe and some fruit. Since I didn't try any of them all I can say is EVERYONE had empty plates . My dish was super yummy but HUGE so I ended up bringing half of it home. I am terrible at remembering the names of items but I will say this place is priced around 10-15$ per entree but you get TONS of food and good quality taste and EXCEPTIONAL service. I was helped by Happy and Friendly people even when checking out and paying at the front. What impressed me the most though was they had no problem giving us seperate checks and at NO TIME were we rushed at all even while we were done eating and sitting there talking the afternoon away. I can't wait to return with my family to try out some more awesome dishes...If you're a breakfast person or even just a fan of delicious asian fushion give this place a shot!",

BUT, you must either come really early to ensure you are not waiting in line too long, or come an hour and a half before it closes (considered lunch time - or Brinner if you will) so that the wait isn't as long as in the morning.    I ordered the Adobo fried rice.  It comes wrapped up in an egg omelete.  A little much egg for me, but the adobo fried rice itself was really good!  In fact, my mouth is watering as I'm typing this out.  That's how good it is!  Then I ordered a short stack of the Peanut Butter and Jelly pancakes with banana.  Best pancakes I have ever had.  I loved it!  You have to come here and order both an entree and another entree just for the pancakes.  You will not regret the calorie intake!  The people I came with had the corn beef hash, the portoguese sausage and eggs, and of course the infamous red velvet pancakes.  The full stack is huge!  They both very much enjoyed their meal as well.  I HIGHLY recommend this place.  It's so good!",

Babycakes is nestled in a tiny plaza (which I didn't see anything that was corporate, just Mom & Pop places) on Buffalo, near Smoke Ranch.   My friend and I showed up here at 11:25am on a Saturday and were told a 45 minute wait.  No prob!  Gave us time to catch up.  45 minutes later we go up to the hostess stand and were told we needed to wait another 20-30 minutes longer.  ugh!  really?  I was ready to gnaw off my arm!  Finally, an hour and five minutes later, we were sat.  We decided to order: -A Single Nutella Crepe w/ Strawberries: served w/ whipped cream and almonds. TO.DIE.FOR!  OMG!  Everything you expect in a delicious crepe with Nutella.  The fresh strawberries sent it over the edge.  So good!  We shared: - Short Stack of Red Velvet Pancakes: topped w/ whipped cream & chocolate crumbles, served with cream cheese syrup.  These were very good.  More like a dessert, but delicious!  The cream cheese syrup is what seals the deal!  It's like frosting, just a little thinner and not AS sugary as frosting.  Really.  You are eating cake for breakfast- and no one is judging!  My husband asked me to bring him home the Tuna Sandwich on Wheat.  The tuna was good, but not \"like mom makes\" if that makes sense.  We didn't touch the fries because they were cold by the time I got home.    I want to go back to get the Adobo Fried Rice and the Cinnamon Bun or the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes. (those pancakes are seasonal).  I also want to try the hashbrowns,  bacon and omelettes.    Yes, everything looked delicious!",

Which ensures that you'll be able to enjoy some of their other awesome menu items!  I am a hawaiian girl, so I'll all about the portuguese sausage & eggs- thumbs up for authenticity! I just wish they would get coconut syrup for their macadamia nut pancakes!!!  Even my boyfriend loves Babycakes- he gets chicken fried steak everywhere we go & claims that they have the best. He's not very easy to please either- so this means alot.   The service is just as great as the food, everyone is so nice & helpful. The two times we've dined here- we have had outstanding service.   Can't wait for our next visit! =]",

The wait is bad. It's not a great place to come to if all your friends are planing to meet up here. They don't sit you down unless your whole party is there.   The food was spectacular though and our server was very friendly and accommodating. And the wait for our food wasn't that long.   I ordered the Baby Chick Omlette and Cinnubun Pancakes  I highly recommend coming here especially if you're from out of town. It's a nice, relaxed ambiance.",

We got our much needed coffee within maybe 2 minutes of being seated. Also, our server (I want to say his name was Jake?) was so friendly and attentive. Coffee never dropped below half full. Now to the most important stuff: the food. O.M.G. It was delicious! I had a skillet with the hazelnut pancakes on the side, hubby had the adobo fried rice with red velvet pancakes, and our daughter had a short stack of the banana cream pancakes. We ate until we were beyond stuffed because it was too good to stop! The skillet had lots of flavor, I didn't even add hot sauce like I usually would. Pancakes were to die for. Husband was very impressed with the adobo, and he's usually hyper-critical of any adobo that isn't his mama's.    All in all, the 3 of us left very satisfied.",

Never ran out of water and my boyfriend never ran out of coffee.  I got the Portuguese sausage plate. It tasted like kielbasa. Not what I was looking for. I upgraded to the garlic fried rice and it clearly states that there are onions in the rice but DAAANG, These were fairly larger pieces of onion that were barely cooked. It didn't taste like garlic at all. Just sweated out onions mixed in some oily rice. My eggs came out okay though. After I picked out the onions and mixed everything together things kind of got better.  So let me talk about the dude with the ponytail when we walked in. I made eye contact and said hi to him. He did not say hi back. I said it loud enough for others to hear it. He did say hi to my boyfriend though. Boyfriend said hi back. Boyfriend noticed he didn't say hi back to me and kind of brushed it off. I hope he didn't hear me or something because that was kind of rude. It kind of put me in a bad mood for the rest of our experience here though so that kind of sucked.  If I go back I think I would get either the loco moco or the kaluha pork grilled cheese. They looked good. I don't care if it doesn't \"match\" with the super sweet pancakes. It's good for the soul and you can always treat those like dessert.   Make sure you come early and you are patient. This place gets really busy and it's really tight and cramped. Don't get impatient. It's not their fault.",

I really don't want to give this rating for such a great food spot. But how can it be such a coincidence that I come order the same dish between different months that we can possibly find hairs in the food.   The first occasion when we found the hair we spoke to the manager and he switched the dish for us, the second time they just apologized and offered a free small stack. It's quite unfortunate that it happened twice but that's more than enough for me not to come back.

    "text": "If you're looking for a local breakfast spot with good home cooking, BabyStacks is definitely the place to checkout. They have several pancake options to choose from. My favorite pancakes are the Banana Fosters or German Chocolate pancakes.   The Banana Fosters pancakes are sauteed bananas cooked in butter and sugar which is smothered on top of 2-4 stacks of buttermilk pancakes and a dollop of fresh whip cream.   If you like fried rice, I recommend that you order a side of garlic fried rice. The fried rice definitely has a great flavor of roasted garlic and onions. I absolutely love to balance it out with Portuguese Sausage that has a kick of spice and top it with an over easy egg.   I must admit the customer service is not always consistent but the food is so worth it.",

    "text": "Just left. I'm so bummed. I've been to BabyStacks once before at a different location, and it was great. I don't go often because it's so unhealthy, but I was having a bad day, so decided to cheer myself up with a skillet and some pancakes. I got the veggie skillet, swapped peppers for carnitas. I got a hazelnut baby stack on the side. My friend got a full stack of the mocha.   His pancakes came out fine. They had the speciality mocha pancakes with chocolate and whipped cream. I got my skillet at the same time. It tasted okay, but it had its own swimming pool in the bottom, so everything was kinda wet and gross. I had been planning on only eating half while also eating my pancakes, but there were no pancakes to be seen. The waiter told me it would be out shortly.   I finished the entire skillet, and then finally got my pancakes as my friend asked for a box. I decided to take a bite before boxing them up myself. They looked a bit light compared to how I've seen them before. lol and behold, it was just plain pancakes with a hazelnut drizzle on it. Which was like, the most disappointing thing possible when coming to the only place that had specialty pancakes. I just put them in a box. I don't want to waste my calories on pancakes I could make at home. I didn't say anything to my server because we needed to go home and I don't like making a scene, but I'm upset, so here ya go.   I came here with regular expectations. I just expected my food to come out as it's supposed to. But unfortunately, that was a bit too much today. Maybe the chefs are having a rough go of it, I don't know, but my trip to cheer myself up unfortunately just left me in a worse mood and $33 poorer.",

Like a lot of other reviews said the place is very small so there isn't a lot of seating but we didn't have to wait at all which was great. It was also very cold in there, I was borderline shivering and my friend and I were trying to find somewhere without a vent but they were everywhere.   The service was good. They were very attentive and nice and kept checking on us during our meal which was a highlight. I kept asking the waiter for recommendations while ordering and he was helpful and didn't get annoyed by it.   They had a special for a fajita omelette or you could have it as a skillet. I decided to try that because it sounded good. I asked for no mushrooms, no sour cream and light onions and they made it exactly how I asked with no mistakes. The skillet was good and i enjoyed it. They used carne asada type steak, green peppers, onions and cheddar cheese on top which were over roasted potatoes. It was a bit runny on the bottom though which made the potatoes slightly soggy. Lastly, I got the strawberry lemonade for my drink along with water. They make it with strawberry puree and then they mix Tropicana lemonade out of the machine into it. Kind of a strange way to make it but it actually tasted pretty good, but very sweet. Overall I would give it another shot. It was a decent experience and the service was excellent.",

In this location, I have tried their adobo fried rice omelette with banana cream pancake short stack.  Both of my friends all got the spam scrambled with banana pancakes as well. Their portion size is very genuine and I had to share mine with my boyfriend.  It was very hearty with the fried rice and banana pancakes.  Their short stack is about 3 pancakes, regular size I heard has about 6 pancakes.  Oh my!   Service: was great.  Servers were nice and attentive and would come check on us constantly and refill our drinks too.   Food: i like their adobo fried rice and banana cream pancakes.  I got their banana pancakes again for take out at the other location too.   Their banana cream is just right amount of sweetness and not too overpowering.   the pancakes were pretty fluffy.  Talking about it makes me want some now. hahaha.  I heard in May, they serves Tres Lechan pancakes, Oohh I am looking forward.  stay tunes on the updated review.  They sell K cup coffee too.  I had the sample of it and really like it and decided to purchase more to bring it back home.",

Be sure to get there early because it gets busy and the wait can be long, but if you have time please stay, I'm sure you'll love it.   _________________________________________________________________ SPANIS VERSION  Pancakes es uno de mis platillos favoritos y cuando escucho que hay un lugar que ofrece unos deliciosos y esponjados pancakes tengo que probarlo.  Cuentan con algunas locaciones en la ciudad donde puedes disfrutar de un delicioso desayuno, tambien tienen varias opciones aparte de pancakes para escoger.  Siguelos en sus cuentas de redes sociales para estar al tanto de sus especiales de temporada como el panque de calabaza, o panque de limon y muchos mas.

About fifteen minutes later we were seated in the refrigerator.  I mean you could almost see your breath in there.  Way to cold, and as I expected food didn't stay warm very long. Waitress took our water orders and when it arrived it smelled just like a heavily chlorinated pool.  Had to ask that she take it away.  I ordered the Spinach Benedict and a side of Lemon Ricotta pancakes, and the wife ordered a Ranchero skillet with the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  Food was very good, but cool due to the low temp in the room.  When paying for our meal, we advised them that the ladies room was unusable and the cashier, a guy, said yeah we know it's been going on for some time now, as if he could care less.  We also noticed that the place was rather dirty with food and lots of trash all over the floor.  Probably would not return.",

Yelp has this place at $$, but I think $ is more fitting. I got a four egg omelette, potatoes, and pancakes for $10.01 after tax pretip. The portions aren't humongous, but that's not a bad thing. After a long session at the gym, I ate two pancakes (the main reason I came), half of my potatoes, half of my omelette, and I felt good as in \"no nap required\" good. The food wasn't greasy either.   I ordered the Mexican omelette. Carnitas, jalapenos, Pico de gallo, and sour cream. I'm not big on sour cream but I did ask for a side of green salsa for some extra kick. If I did it again, I'd see if I could get green salsa instead of sour cream.

Its True the place is on the other side of town, but after my girlfriend brought me to this place I can't help but want more.  The service is great and I always feel welcome whenever I go there.  I've already been there a few times and I must say I've recommended it to my friends and those who are looking for a place to eat.  If I had to suggest something, I'd prolly say try Ricks Adobo Fried Rice, the Chocolate Chip Pancakes, or the Breakfast Burrito with Sausage...  If you do live far, if you go there to eat, I'm gonna tell you right now, that it is worth the drive. Hehe",

    "text": "Breakfast is my \"thing\" and I struggle to find great breakfast spots in area neighborhoods. Heard about Babycakes a while back and finally tried it this morning with another breakfast lover. The menu is phenomenal. I'd go back with a large group - preferably after running a marathon so I could indulge guilt-free! This is a breakfast and lunch place but I was all about breakfast.  The menu featured any kind of egg item imaginable - many omelettes. Eggs benny. Etc.  And this place is a carb lover's dream come True. Pancakes. Waffles. Crepes. Combos. I tried an egg combo with poached eggs and turkey bacon so I could enjoy bites of two different types of pancakes - banana and also peanut butter. (Go with someone you feel very comfortable with so you can share and sample, as I did today.)   The peanut butter pancakes (studded w/chocolate chips) were outstanding. So good that I was content after a few delicious bites. I'd love to try the cinnamon bun pancakes (a special this week) or the mac nut pancakes. The menu also featured carrot cake pancakes, s'mores, lemon ricotta and many others.  Side items include everything imaginable plus some more unusual items, like garlic fried rice. The eggs benny varieties were also impressive!  Kalua pig eggs benny, for example. Loved the inventive and affordable kids menu , which features a grilled PB&J.  This places gets really busy on weekends so trying it for the first time during the week is a good idea.  Was worried the hightop tables would be uncomfortable but the leather barstools were great - they also had some lower tables.  I loved that the combos are so inventive and that the menu was so extensive.",

    "text": "i looked up breakfast places to check out during my trip to vegas this past week and babycakes cafe totally caught my eye. i had my friend in vegas meet up with me at mgm and i drove us there. he lives in henderson and is in vegas all the time so he was pretty dubious about driving to summerlin to get breakfast.   as we sat there waiting to be seated (don't worry, the wait wasn't bad at all) i pointed at their specials and the newspaper article on the wall that says they base their pancake flavors off of cupcake flavors (hence the name. DURRRRR. yes. i am slow... but i got there!). he got excited and grabbed a menu. it was sensory overload as we studied the menu like a doc studies a brain to be dissected. before we were even taken to our seats, he decided on the adobe fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. ask i am not a fan of getting the same thing as whoever i'm with (i'll admit, i was a little sad. those were both things i wanted to try hahahaha) i went with the special: white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes and the portuguese sausage and garlic fried rice. actually it was the sausage and it came with rice and pancakes and eggs. i just added the garlic fried rice and white choc mac nut pancakes. and i'll tell you.   LOVE.  L. O. V. E.   the mac nuts in the pancakes weren't huge and annoying as some mac nut pancakes are. the white chocolate kept its shape but melted easily so it wasn't just huge chunks of chocolate. the portuguese sausage went really well with the garlic fried rice. if you like spicy like me, a little tabasco makes it even better.   next time, red velvet pancakes and cream cheese frosting, you are mine.   oh and btw, love the interior. lots of nice natural light.   i think the only thing that would make this place even better is macadamia nut syrup for their coffee. or kona coffee.",

    "text": "Ok, so....  Knowing I had a day off on MLK day, my mouth started notifying me that it would again like to indulge in red velvet pancakes.  I submitted to the request, and got to Babycakes at just about 9am.  There were 3 tables open, so no wait.  Huge improvement!  It was again a weekday, though, and I noted that 15 minutes after I was seated, there were indeed approximately 10 people waiting.  That being said, I decided to tweak my ordering to include one of the Polynesian elements of the menu, and rather than getting potatoes or hash browns with my over-medium eggs and peppered bacon (yum), I got a mound of garlic and onion fried rice.  Very good call on my part.  The rice was slightly crispy and had slivers of onion and whole cloves of garlic which had a roasted, rather than pungent, flavor.  It was delish with the eggs!  And, as the trip demanded, I upgraded my pancakes to 2 small red velvet pancakes.  My taste buds cried a little.  :)",

We waited in the tiny entry way with about 5 other parties while tables cleared and no one was seated.   Some people who the hostess apparently knew were offered coffee while they waited, but nobody else was.  Our 20 minute wait was actually a 40 minute wait.  We ordered red velvet pancakes, smores pancakes and an omelet. We all thought the food was awful.  It was obviously prepared quickly and just slopped on the plates.  No taste and very poor presentation.  Another thing that really irritated me was $3 for a kid's apple juice.  That is just wrong.",

They are similar in style to Original Pancake House, great buttermilk flavor, and waaaay more interesting varieties (pb+j, smores, carrot cake, red velvet, and seasonal pumpkin!!). The red velvet pancakes are truly delicious, much better flavor then ones I've had that are more like pancakes dyed red. These are topped with homemade whipped cream, chocolate, and a cream cheese syrup that serves as the icing and is heavenly. And somehow they are not overly sweet! Other menu items include omelets, benedicts, and some Hawaiian and Filipino specials (including a fried rice omelet). Major props for having good iced tea (Shangri La tropical). Cant wait to come back and try their other pancakes. Oh and be prepared to wait- our server said the wait this morning was 45 mins (and this joint is small!).",

Even on a Thursday morning at 8am u would  expect to see more customers. It felt weird to be the only customers, I kinda wanted to leave but glad I didn't . The place is small and most of the tables are high, hate that like to feel the floor when I'm sitting down. I had the loco moco( eggs, burger patty and rice )covered in brown gravy served w/ side of mac salad.. Rice was a little crusty, burger little tough , gravy was good. Mac salad ok . Now your wondering why the four stars , that's ez the RED VELVET PANCAKES !!!! These pancakes are awesome . Red pancakes sprinkled with choco chips and a huge dollop of what looks and taste like fresh whipped cream , served with cream cheese syrup . These are some of the best pancakes I ever ate, they taste like a cross between a cake and pancake. Pure genious . After tasting the red velvet pancake i was so close to ordering the smore's pancake, but held back don't know why , should have gone for it. I gotta try the smore's and carrot cake pancakes. There are couple intresting menu items kalua pig Benedict and spam sramble :) . Next time, service was really friendly and prompt .",

I ordered kalua pig Benedict and my husband ordered adobo fried rice with Mac salad. Both were not good at all! The kalua pig Benedict was kalua pig and CABBAGE Benedict...totally gross no taste from the kalua pig and the English muffin on the bottom was soggy from water...if it was soggy from like a tasty liquid that would've been different but it wasn't. The adobo fried rice was junk. If you are from Hawaii and know good adobo fried this was not even close. We thought aloha kitchen AFR was junk this was worse. The Mac salad was DISGUSTING to say the very least. It had no taste and the macaroni tasted old. It was like soaked (not boiled) macaroni in a watery white substance. I gave this one star because we also ordered the red velvet pancakes and although it was a little dry it did taste good. We also got a side of zippy's chili which was about an ounce for $2.75 that tasted good (like zippys chili) so our bill came out to $47 and some cents and we were Very Very disappointed to have to pay that much for such a crappy meal.",

For a restaurant that opened a month ago, they were bustling with activity.  The hostess told us there is a 35 minute wait.  Even though my partner gave me a look that meant \"should we?,\" I ignored the tone that came out from his voice and told the lady we would wait.  While we waited, we perused the menu in and out because they had so many choices.  I was having a hard time keeping to my pescatarian leanings when I saw the Rick's Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelet.  I finally gave in and ordered the adobo and a short stack of red velvet pancakes.  The partner ordered the Breakfast Burrito (without the meat, so proud of him).  I was so happy when the pancakes came.  It had whipped cream, chocolate chips, and cream cheese syrup.  The pancakes were awesome.  Even my partner enjoyed it and I am the one with the red velvet cravings.  When the adobo omelet came, I was in heaven!  The egg that wrapped the adobo rice(yes you read right) was fluffy and had green onions in it.  Plus, the fried rice had TONS of chicken adobo.  I didn't regret the meat eating after the first bite.   It also came with macaroni salad on the side.  Like everything else, it was yummy.  My partner ate his Breakfast Burrito and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The owner also asked how the food was and when she walked away, my partner  said she looked like an Asian Jessica Alba.  The place was a nice place with cozy decor.  I would totally recommend this place to anyone.  We are definitely coming back there when my sister visits.  She saw the picture of the Red Velvet Pancakes and told us to take her there next time.",

I ordered the kalua pig Benedict (two of my favorite foods combined sounded amazing) and the red velvet pancakes. The best thing about the pancakes was the whipped cream on top them. The pancakes themselves were really bland with odd tasting chocolate pieces and a decent cream cheese syrup. The concept is great and the price isnt bad but they're definitely not worth ordering again. The eggs Benedict were mediocre as well. I could get more flavorful hollandaise from ihop, which is says a lot. The pork wasnt tasty to me but I've had too much perfectly cooked kalua pork to enjoy anything less than. I thought the fried cabbage was a pretty good accent though.  I'd try different menu items from this place again when it isn't as busy in hopes that it's reputation isn't pure hype but honestly this place is average at best.",

    "text": "I went here with one of my best friends the other week since she's been talking about it for quite some time now. I was visiting Vegas so I thought it would be good to try it out since I've heard so much about it.   I ended up ordering two items since we decided to share them both.  I ordered the Huntington as well as the red velvet pancakes. The Huntington was a very tasty omelette that had the perfect mix of ingredients. The avocado on top was a nice touch as well.   The red velvet pancakes were delicious as well. I loved the fuchsia color that is used, which gives it a really nice appearance. They use cream cheese syrup that goes PERFECTLY with the meal. I think the red velvet pancakes are a must.  I'm excited to come back and try more things but the red velvet pancakes will always be ordered!",

    "text": "Red Velvet Pancakes with Cream Cheese Frosting.  If any other review on this profile are calling these \"the shizz\", there's a reason.  I'm joining that chorus of voices because this is more like a dessert....  A dessert filled with AWESOME!  I had Eggs Benedict to go with them, and it was also pretty delicious.  Basically, everything I tried here was pretty darn good,  A few things to note: The place is inanely busy, the wait takes a fairly long time, and they close in the early afternoon.  I can understand the wait regarding the quality of food.  It's worth the wait, but come early.  The wait was about 30 minutes or so, but they keep a pretty tight schedule in making sure you get seated before of within that time.  The staff remains friendly, and attentive from seating to getting refills.  A little crowded with a short dining window, but man, was it ever worth it.  But really, if there's any reason to go, it's those red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese frosting.  Any other point I could possibly make is pretty much moot after eating those.  (That was the highlight of my breakfast, if your couldn't tell.)",

Just yesterday (Nov. 4, 2014) I dined here with my daughter and we were seated right away.  Place was almost filled, but that is to be expected for a small dining area.  This day we had Monica as our server, and she had waited on me before on previous visits as well.  She is the constant professional, sweet, attentive, and clearly knowledgeable of her duties.  On this visit I ordered the bacon and egg breakfast with seasoned potatoes, their seasonal pumpkin pancakes with that delicious sauce, and an order of wheat toast.  My daughter enjoyed their bacon pancakes.  Everything came out within 10-12 min of ordering and was perfectly prepared.  I forgot to ask Monica to make my bacon crispy, but it was still good.  I love their bacon!  Daughter also enjoyed her cakes too...while stealing a few of my potatoes.    I look forward to my next visit where I know the food and service will be just as enjoyable.  Keep up the great quality BabyStacks team!!",

They have a vast variety of pancake types, a special of the day for pancakes, and are known for their red velvet pancakes.  Heres my rundown of plus and minuses: -for our two regular breakfasts,with upgraded pancakes, I had coffee and oj, she had apple juice,after tip our bill was $30!!!!!!!!!! +red velvet pancakes are fan~freakin~tastic -not real orange juice +overall a tasty breakfast -a very small venue,which is super busy -for the size of the food/price, we didn't have much to take home  I would return again by myself to keep cost down, because those red velvet babies are delicious. My daughter wasn't a fan of red velvet anything until trying these. Those little chocolate chips, whipped cream, and cream cheese syrup really create the perfect toppings.",

Everything about the food was fantastic.  The ambiance was awesome.  The hostess made us feel welcomed, as if we were Ohana (that's Family in Hawiian).  Waitress was extremely friendly and was helpful with suggestions since we had never been there.    There is a little bit of a wait, I think that was because of how good of a place this is.  They seemed to have their regulars because I saw them calling people by their first name.    I think this place is one of the best places I have visited in Vegas.  The only thing I will knock on this place is the restrooms (sorry I'm picky about certain things), they did need to be attended to.  I would have given this place a 5 STAR rating if it had not been for this one thing.",

That's right, this place is good enough to take your hungover a** in the car and drive 15 mins of the strip to get replenished by Red Velvet Pancakes.   My boyfriend was whining and griping about going so far to eat breakfast. I had Babycakes bookmarked for a year, and there was NOTHING that was going to stop me. We got a short stack of the cakes and a spinach benedict to share. After one bite, he was singing the same tune.   Just what we needed to soak up all the liquor from the night before. Babycakes, I love you.",

The only difference is that in Babycakes Cafe in Las Vegas it is much cheaper to get the full stack.  You get six pancakes topped with cream cheese syrup for nine dollars.  In San Diego, you get two pancakes with cream cheese spread on top and in between the pancakes with fruit for $11.    Personally, I would rather have red velvet pancakes in Las Vegas than San Diego because I get my money worth for six pancakes for nine dollars.  Sorry, Babycakes in San Diego.    I recommend coming to Babycakes Cafe on a weekday near opening time because my boyfriend and I didn't wait on a Tuesday morning around 10:15 AM.    If you love red velvet everything-cupcakes, drinks, pancakes--I recommend getting these pancakes.  You will not be disappointed.",

I ordered the corned beef hash (which was a no brainer after the waitress said that it was NOT from a can), scrambled eggs, seasoned potatoes and bacon pancakes. Yes.... BACON pancakes.  The corned beef hash was delicious. Scrambled eggs, good. Seasons potatoes weren't really noticeably \"seasoned,\" but it wasn't bad either. The bacon pancakes are a creative invention, but when it comes down to it, it tastes as if you took a bite of pancake and just so happened to shove some bacon into your mouth a couple seconds later (Don't judge. That's probably a normal thing for people who eat fast). The pancake with or without the bacon though, is really good.  Kalila got scrambled eggs, 4 sausage links, hashbrowns and RED VELVET PANCAKES! She doesn't even like pancakes, but there was no way we were going to baby stacks without getting the RVpancakes. She got them and loved them. They were really good! Kalila was nervous about the \"cream cheese syrup,\" but she loved that too! It tasted like the frosting that comes with toaster strudel. Scrambled eggs, just as good as mine. Sausage links, bomb dipped in maple syrup. Hashbrowns were tasty!   Everything was really good! While walking back to the car, we talked about how much fun we actually had eating that meal. It was worth the road trip it took to get there.",

They have a wonderful selection of pancakes. The fiance raves about the Kahlua Pork Benedict. He has never shared so I cannot comment on that. I would say that their garlic rice can be hit or miss.

They come out hot, moist and delightfully soft. Soft enough you do not need a knife to cut them, as all good pancakes shouldn't. Aside from the texture, the innovative spins they have in their recipes (Cinnabun, orange creamsicle, PB and ?) tie them together in an extremely palatable and delicious experience. Boyfriend had rocky road, I enjoyed the hazelnut myself. Both were delish!  As it was pushing into lunch time we also ordered a kalua grilled cheese and an eggs benedict. The grilled cheese deserved a 4/5 in terms of tastefulness and innovation. The benedict I found a little bland in flavor and too reminiscent of many other breakfast joints in town.   Service was an A+. Seated at approximately the given wait time, staff was very friendly and attentive.  Altogether a thumbs up!",

    "text": "BabyStacks Cafe brings me back to island life because of their ono grindz, island music, and kamaaina-esque service. This place sort of reminds me of Eggs 'n Things and Koa Pancake House in Hawaii, but comparing BabyStacks to those places just isn't fair.  BabyStacks is your typical breakfast/brunch joint with an island/filipino-inspired flare. Their menu items include the usual eggs, bacon, sausage, crepes, french toast, pancakes (large variety), etc. but if you're looking for something more (I'm talkin' to all ya'll Pacific Islander Yelpers) they also have spam, Portuguese sausage, loco moco (with the choice of garlic fried rice), Kalua pig (benedict), adobo fried rice (omelette), etc.   The restaurant is quite small and fills up rather quickly, but for our party of 7 (arriving after about an hour and a half of opening) only waited for about 15 minutes. Not too bad. I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and thanks to my family, I was able to try bites of the Kalua Pig Benedict and Nutella Crepes. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was delicious! The rice is fried with Filipino-style chicken adobo, wrapped inside a fried egg (hence, \"omelette\"), and garnished with scallions. The portion they serve is big enough for two people, so if you're not too hungry or want to try more things on the menu, I'd suggest sharing. The Kalua Pig Benedict was also very good. The pork was cooked and seasoned well. I wouldn't mind ordering it on my next visit. The Nutella crepe was just alright. I prefer my crepes to be thinner. The thickness of the crepe topped with cream made it a little soggy for my taste. If you do decide to order crepes I'd, again, suggest sharing it because they're huge! Talk about kanak-attack!!!  They also have daily specials that aren't menu regulars, so if you're looking for a unique breakfast experience check this place it out!",

Not \"blow your mind amazing\", but good. Had the lemon ricotta, and they were light and fresh. Don't just dredge them in the cream cheese syrup, use it sparingly. Very sweet!  Huevos rancheros. \"What kind of salsa do you want, red or green?\" \"What's the difference?\" [blank look] \"One is red, and one is green.\"  After the meal... \"I am leaving the check for you. Have a nice day.\"  Usually that's code for get the heck out, but the place was still half empty and there was no one waiting. We wanted a 2nd cup of coffee, but couldn't get anyone's attention. Finally gave up and left...got back in the car and realized that we'd spent a whole 20 minutes having breakfast.   So, fast food when the place isn't packed, but the service needs some training. We didn't feel welcomed enough to make this a regular stop, but will keep it in mind if we're in the mood for pancakes.",

    "text": "Vegas is quickly becoming my home away from home.  The mister and I want to continue with our off the beaten path Vegas experience.  I've been wanting to try BabyStacks ever since I discovered that they serve Adobo Fried Rice omelette.   We headed over to BabyStacks as soon as we arrived from our long journey from LA.  The place a bit small and there was already a wait at 8:30AM on a Saturday morning.   The 10 minute wait wasn't too bad considering some of the lengthy waiting I've had done in the past.    While I waited, I noticed the sign with the pancake specials: Almond Joy pancakes or Butterfinger pancakes.  Ooh!  That sounded yummy.  I also noticed that a lot of the people were ordering Red Velvet pancakes.  It was going to be hard for me to decide what to order.    When we got to our table, I quickly scanned the menu for the Adobo Fried Rice omelet and I got nervous when I couldn't find it under omelettes.  Then, low and behold, I saw Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. The description said it was chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg.  Bingo!  That was it.  I ordered that as well as the Almond Joy pancakes.    I got my pancakes and was pleasantly surprised at what I saw.  I thought it was going to be a regular pancake with bits of Almond Joy candy pieces scattered though the batter.  Instead, it was a chocolate pancake with coconut flakes and sliced almonds sprinkled on top of the whipped cream with chocolate drizzle.  It tasted like a friggin cupcake, it was sooo good.    The Adobo Fried Rice was also spectacular.  It was such a clever idea.  Why didn't I think of making that?  I made a mental note to try making my own version one of these days.  The only thing that fell flat was the macaroni salad that was served with it, it was very bland.  I doused it with Sriracha sauce, which helped.    This is an awesome breakfast spot. Prices are very reasonable and it is great for families. I wished they had a location back in LA.  At least it will be one of my breakfast spots whenever I am in Vegas.",

Their hours are just right for those early risers and those who like to munch for brunch.  Came here once for a quick lunch before work and loved the idea of omurice done Filipino-style. Immediately ordered the adobo fried rice and my food was out in no time. Someone was heavy handed on the soy sauce or I'm really sensitive to sodium, because fried rice was overwhelmingly salty. The egg and the macaroni salad helped tame it, but I was still gulping down lots of water.  That didn't deter me from coming back to try their kalua pig benedict and splitting a stack of their signature red velvet pancakes with some friends. They have the basic eggs benedict on lock. English muffins were toasted well, eggs were poached perfectly, and the hollandaise sauce was creamy but not heavy. Love their Hawaiian twist on it with the moist kalua pork! I really liked their fluffy, tasty pancakes, but I'm more drawn in by their savory offerings.  For a weekday afternoon, they seemed pretty busy, but it didn't affect their quality of service at all. The wait staff was always very attentive and friendly!  Normally, I just sleep off my hunger and miss breakfast, but I'd wake up early for this. Willingly.",

    "text": "I've been hearing the buzz about BabyStacks forever, and hadn't checked it out because I'm not big on traditional breakfast food for breakfast and very rarely indulge in pancakes etc.   Today, I was driving around and saw that they are very close to my home in the old Becker's Steakhouse center. It was 1:30 and I walked in, was greeted and led to a table and told my server would be right with me.   A couple was enjoying huge platters of pancakes and what looked like French Toast nearby. The mood was livened by reggae music playing.   My trepidation about arriving 30 minutes prior to closing was alleviated straightaway by the cheerful server. She was more than happy to suggest the Turkey & Avocado sandwich when I said I was debating that or salad. I opted for the $1 add on fruit salad in lieu of a side salad whose dressings all sounded heavy to me, and I'm not sure if fries were an option, but I avoid them.   My sandwich was huge. Hard to get my mouth around huge. Thick slices of toasted wheat bread housed a generous portion of very good turkey, fresh avocado slices and tomatoes, and lots of iceberg. It was so large I took half to go along with half of my fruit salad which contained strawberries, melon, grapes, blueberries and pineapple. I made the oversight of failing to request mustard or to put mayo on the side, so it contained quite a bit of mayo (unnecessary because the turkey was moist and avocado only added to that)   Chatted with some of the staff who were very sweet, and in no way felt rushed so close to closing time. I'll definitely be back to try some other items and bring my chocolate lover friends in for those red velvet pancakes. Some of the crepes and other pancakes sound promising.   There was cute and cheery decor and the place was clean and inviting. After reading of long lines, guess I lucked out taking a chance.   For 11$ + 5& tip because my waitress was just so sweet talking about explaining skype to her grandma in Hawaii, I enjoyed a lovely lunch & dinner later on.   Glad to have finally discovered this neighborhood gem and look forward to supporting a charming local business.",

We found this cute lil place that clearly had good food.  We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, but we were seated in under 5 minutes.  The waitress got the drinks quick and was ready with all our questions on the menu.  We had three different omelets that were picture perfect!  We tried their German Chocolate, Strawberry, and Cinnabon pancakes.  All were great lil piles of smiles!!  A really great bang for your buck breakfast spot!!!",

Next time you come to Baby stacks as to be seated in Jacobs' section, you will be glad you did.",

By the name you would guess that they specialize in pancakes and you would be right. They have at least 12 varieties and usually a special flavor of the day. I can only speak to the pancake combo breakfast but it is fantastic. Way better than pancakes at home or anywhere else. The eggs are always cooked perfectly to my liking and their turkey bacon is tasty. Service is quick and friendly. Great spot for great pancakes!",

I ordered the steak & eggs with an upgrade of red velvet pancakes ($1.50 more for the upgrade).  I was highly disappointed on how everything tasted.  It was all DRY.  I know i'm not at some high-end steak house but the steak was extremely chewy and hard to cut.  There was absolutely no flavor and had to doused it in A1-sauce. The red-velvet pancake tasted good, but dry.   I love the chocolate taste that goes with it, but that was the only thing that tasted appealing (Since I am a lover for sweets.)   The server was sub-par, she took a while to get our orders and we had to constantly call her to re-fill our drinks.    Maybe i'll come back, but who knows.",

I have tried red velvet pancakes a many times at other places since visiting BabyStacks and I can unequivocally say that no one does it better than BabyStacks.  I've also yet to see anyone else do the cream cheese icing that pairs so wonderfully with the red velvet pancakes.    The restaurant fills up quickly so you'll probably end up having to wait a for a table.  Luckily, getting a table for two only took about 10 minutes on a busy weekend.  I can't wait to come back and get my red velvet pancake fix.",

    "text": "Hmmm I have weird reviews on Babycakes.So I gave them a 3 star cause the pepper killed my food. So I will just don't know were to start. Ok let's just start with the food.   RV pancakes it's alright nothing to rave about. The only thing that is good was the sauce for it and it was moist. White Mac pancakes nothing different just add mac nuts in a regular pancakes and top it off with white chocolate chips. oooooh so exciting. I ordered the the Rick's adobo fried rice and my niece ordered the loco moco. Man can I say \"someone REALLY loves pepper. Even the mac salad was way to peppery. It seem like someone was mad at the pepper that day. The Loco moco was ehhh good. My nephew ordered the piglet which was actually good. But I can't say about the home fries I did not taste it cause I'm not a fan of any type of home fries except for hash browns.   The service was friendly and I think she was the manager she was awesome. She came a few times to check on us. And so did the waitress. That's always a plus. Water was filled and with a smile.   The place is cute and the decor was pretty cool. They even have a section for the kids coloring section. plus plus for that.   The parking is a private lot which there is plenty. I would love to come back but it's far from where I live so it might be awhile.   But be prepared to wait for awhile there was a wait of 15 mins when we got there at 1230 (lunch time)",

    "text": "BabyStacks Cafe is definitely on my list of favorite places in Vegas. Not only do they have great breakfast food, but the atmosphere inside is so relaxing. Upon walking in the first thing I heard was the local music playing in the background.  I haven't heard any local music since I last visited Hawaii during the summer, so it was a very nice surprise.   The menu at BabyStacks Cafe definitely reflects that Hawaii feel as well. There are some great breakfast selections such as Portuguese sausage & eggs, Rick's adobo fried rice, and of course the pancakes. I decided to try the red velvet pancakes after reading many, many, many positive reviews off of yelp. I also ordered a side of seasoned potatoes because of my HUGE potato addiction.   The red velvet pancakes weren't disappointing at all. Keep in mind they are sweet though, so if you don't care for sweet tasting foods I would stay away from them. The red velvet pancakes are served with whipped cream, chocolate bits, and a side of cream cheese syrup. The combination of all of those toppings definitely leaves a heavenly taste in your mouth after every bite. The seasoned potatoes had the perfect amount of seasoning and wasn't overpowering at all. The texture of the potatoes was slightly crispy, which I enjoyed very much.   I definitely recommend that you try this place at least once. Be warned though, there is always a long wait to be seated. Also, the cafe is only open during select hours during the day, so be sure to double check those before heading out!",

Dad: Go find where the latest I-HOP or Dennys is that isn't on the Strip for breakfast. Don't want to walk that far. Whenever a suggestion of either occurs and I'd rather not go to chains , I use Yelp to find where I could find a gem. Me: (looks at the review page for this restaurant) How about this place? I'm already sold on red velvet pancakes. Dad: Sure.  So after about ~20 minutes of driving, we come across what appears to be the REAL Las Vegas, even down to the \"Lugaw\" sign. We kinda got lost, but quickly found our way back after realizing that their restaurant was across the street and had changed their name.  We came in at just the right time, we were able to find seats yet the restaurant was starting to fill up. I observe the \"People Love Us on Yelp\" and \"Best of Las Vegas 2011\" stickers near the front door.   As I looked at the menu I see a couple of things that struck a chord. \"$1 extra for garlic fried rice\". \"Corned beef hash and eggs\". \"Rick's ADOBO fried rice\". This wasn't going to be a typical breakfast place. What sealed the deal was the \"extra charge to replace buttermilk pancakes with your favorite pancakes.\" SOLD. (If it wasn't already obvious, I'm a Filipino-American with a slight obsession for red velvet). It also helps that all the waitstaff looked Filipino.  My mom built her own omelet, dad ordered the adobo fried rice and I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs with garlic fried rice and red velvet pancakes.  I was quite pleasantly surprised that our breakfast came out pretty quickly. I wolfed my dish down in probably the same amount of time it took to cook it while maintaining a sense of decency. The dish was everything I expected from a Filipino family if they were going to cook the same dish using American corned beef. The onion in the garlic fried rice was a nice touch and I'll consider modifying my garlic fried rice recipe to include onion.  The red velvet pancakes were quite delicious, it tasted like red velvet, but more savory than say a red velvet cupcake. Went well with the melted cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips.  One of these days I'll have to try the adobo fried rice. I wasn't able to have some because I didn't want to infect my dad with a cold, and though it was one of my choices as to what to order, I didn't order it because the dish didn't come with pancakes. Maybe next time.  From this experience I learned a lesson: A lot of the more casual dining gems in Vegas are found off-strip and I look forward to finding more of them. I WILL come back here someday just to round off my review and (hopefully!) upgrade to a 5.",

Babycakes did and I had to try them with a quickness!   I've been here twice already. The first time was with a girlfriend of mine. We were seated immediately, but then again, we came on a Monday morning. Of course, I had to order the red velvet pancakes... and I was not at all disappointed! They were done just right... fluffy, not too sweet, and the cream cheese syrup was the icing on the cake... well, the syrup on the pancake! :P They were so delicious and very filling. I only got the half stack (3 pancakes), but that was more than enough. My friend got the kalua pig benedict and she said it was spot on. I had a little bite and from what I tasted... it was good, but I was just so into my pancakes!   The second time was just a few weeks ago when my brother & sister were in town. The three of us and the bf came on a Saturday morning and waited about 40 minutes, but we knew to expect that and I told them it was worth the wait (since none of them had ever been here before). I, again, got the pancakes (but as a side, which is only two... enough to get my fix) with the bacon & egg breakfast. The bf got the kalua pig benedict with a side of Portuguese sausage. My brother ordered an omelet with some garlic fried rice and my sister had the spinach/mushroom/bacon benedict. Everyone was quite pleased with what they ordered. They all liked it so much, that my siblings want to come again the next time they're here and the bf really wants to try some of their other items.   The food is great, their prices are reasonable, and their staff is super friendly. I live on the SW end of town, but will continue to make the drive out there to get my pancakes! Hope that you all open another location soon... maybe on this side! :)",

Once seated was impressed by how fast and friendly everyone was. Wifey tried the Loco Moco with Garlic Rice. This was fantastic, really very good. I tried the Huevos Ranchero with green salsa...damn good. We both shared the Bacon Pancakes, delicious. Coffee was never empty and great. This was worth the wait. Great breakfast spots are hard to find. Will return many times.",

It just tasted like regular fried rice. It came with a scoop of macaroni salad, which was bland. The pancakes were cooked perfectly, but not good enough for me to drive all the way back here for.

The coffee has always let me down, but service has never disappointed me since the day they opened.   The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of consistency with the pancake batter. Like I said, I've been eating here since they opened. I notice when they change the batter. Most times I get the perfect melt in your mouth pancakes. There was a period I was less frequent because they pancakes were too stiff. I understand they probably play with the recipe to make sure they produce pancakes that hold up under the various topping choices, but I hate stiff and rubber like pancakes. My last visit the pancakes found their way back to their original glory.   Favortie pancakes:  carrot cake banana fosters peanut butter and banana  Luckily large portions does not equal good food to me. If that's your criteria for a \"good' meal then you should go somewhere else. I'm a fan of them not giving me more food than I can or should eat, and I will always comeback for the pancakes.",

I ordered a orange juice, but it was pretty bitter so I asked to switch it out for an apple juice, which the waitress happily did. For my meal, I had a build-it-your-own omelette, with cheddar, chicken, tomatoes and green onions. It was kinda dry, and had a little less chicken than I expected, but the hash browns it came with were pretty on point. The pancakes it also came with were also hella bomb, so next time I'll try a pancake item. If you're into fruit, the strawberries were juicy and ripe. All and all, it was a pretty positive experience. The waiters could be a little more attentive, but I'd give it a whirl if you're in the area, looking for a good breakfast, and it's not the weekend, because then you'll be waitin a helluva long time, ya dig.",

I dont even have the pictures anymore....hmmm. Anywho. OMG this place is amazing!!!!  I think I ordered the Sausage and Eggs and the pancakes came with them.  Hubby ordered the Build Your Own Omelette with the Honey Wheat Pancakes.  Everything was really fresh and the pancakes were out of this world. No words can describe the taste of those Orange Creamiscle pancakes and I tasted his Honey Wheat and they too were amazing.   The only thing is the place is so small.  As soon as our food came the people next to us were lke ohhhh whats that with his nose almost touching my pancakes.  For that reason I will not go often.  I like to have some privacy when eating...give me at least an arm length apart.  If we wouldve both stuck out our arms, we could've hugged lol.  Other than that, great food!!!  May just order to go next time!",

For patrons that may be concerned about the wait, don't be, the time you lose waiting for a table is quickly gained back as the food comes out within five minutes of it being ordered.  Babycakes Cafe is situated within a small strip mall, the wait is long because the food is amazing and the venue is pretty small.   If you don't mind rubbing elbows with hungry Las Vegans and don't get claustrophobic easily, Babycakes is worth a shot.  The menu is plentiful, most notably, Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Benedict and the Red Velvet pancakes which come with a cream cheese frosting.  The pancakes themselves are very light and fluffy with a \"melt in your mouth\" type of consistently.  45 minutes.....worth the wait.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I didn't.  I heard a lot about their pancakes, so I decided I must try some!  I ordered with my sister, brother in lw, and my baby niece. They were very accommodating with the baby.  I see how people can be turned off by the real wait time versus the posted wait time. Our 20 minute wait was only about 10 minutes. Someone was told 30 and they left when they only would have waited 15.  I was leaning towards 3 stars, but the service and speediness of our food made it a 4.  I thought the place was very cute and their staff was very nice.  Our male waiter was especially awesome, checking up on us and coming around at the perfect times, even though the place was packed.   Now for the food..  The orange juice was definitely not fresh, but it's cool. They'd have to keep a bunch of oranges.  I ordered the carrot cake pancakes and the pork adobo fried rice.  My sister got the same entree as me and her fiance got the kalua pork eggs Benedict.  The bro in law thought his food was really good, which is what I'll probably order if I return.  The sister and I agreed the pork adobo fried rice was underwhelming.  The dish was just flat in my opinion; barely seasoned, unseasoned egg, and just lacking flavor. I only ate half, and I usually always finish my food :]  My carrot cake pancakes were awesome! It had actual carrot in it and pecans on top. The cream cheese syrup was really good! I appreciate the portion of syrup, although small, because you get to taste the actual pancake itself instead of sugary syrup.  About everything was under 10 bucks that I saw.   I'd definitely go back for more pancakes, but their \"specialty\" entree of adobo fried rice should have been more of a standout.  Oh yea! We needed hot water and cold water to mix with baby formula and the waiter came through.",

After a long wait 45minutes on a weekend we were finally seated five of us not including the baby. It states all over the menu that a party of six automatically gets charged a gratuity of 18%. We did not order a meal for the ten month old baby, the waitress did not serve the ten month old baby but yet counted him as a whole person charging us the 18% gratuity. I did not notice this on the receipt until we got home. I had left her a twenty dollar tip not realizing that she was counting the baby to get the 18%. I should have checked my receipt before I left the restaurant that is my fault. I don't think a ten month old baby should be counted as a whole person to get a big tip. I have learned a expensive lesson to always check your receipt at restaurants. I don't like this kind of business. Needless to say that I will not be dinning at BabyStacks cafe again.",

    "text": "WOW!!! Is one of the few ways to describe this place. Let's start with the fact that I'm no morning person whatsoever. I work swing sleep all day play all night. It's Vegas you get the idea. The reason I start here is because, this place was so outstanding I woke up early three times in the first week of trying just to have breakfast here. I wake for no one and nothing. Another thing the menu sounds so appetizing I would eat basically anything on it. Why is this also important? Because I'm one of the most extreme picky eaters known to man. Was not afraid to try something new everyday either. Which is just crazy for me. On the way in make sure to read the specials white board so you don't miss out on great seasonal items aswell. I almost passed up pumpkin pancakes. Yes they're different then friggin ihop's or denny's don't know how to describe how though, that's where you find out for yourself. Not to mention great service the wait for food felt like no time. House potatoes pretty typical but they have just the right amount of seasoning then add a side of red salsa...Exquisite! Small location on West Buffalo but worth any trouble anytime. Honestly Love this breakfast joint, life long customer added here, can't wait to keep trying new stuff!!! FYI the famous Red Velvet pancakes really are that unique and amazing, but like I said there's so much more to explore, and they make ordering in different fashions and combinations easy. Definitely give this place at least 2-3 tries lol even though it'll only take one. So much more to go on about but let's be honest, no point waisting time on reading this hurry in and eat up!",

    "text": "Oh BabyStacks, I love you so much!  Staff is always friendly and attentive.  Food is always delicious.  This place consistently impresses me with their service and dishes.  I've been here at various times and different days and this place is always busy.  Normally when I come here I expect at least a 20-30 minute wait, but they usually are pretty good about seating you before the time they tell you.  Let me tell you it is well worth the wait!  However, if you are feeling particularly hungry and can't wait out the time, I recommend going up to the cashier and ordering your food to go.  When I do this I usually wait at most 10-15 minutes for my food and am on my merry way.   My top recommendations are the red velvet pancakes ($5.75 for the short stack) when I first ordered this I was scared that it would be overly sweet, but it's just the right amount.  The pancakes itself are fluffy circles of heaven and the cream cheese syrup compliments it perfectly.  I also like the banana cream pie pancakes ($5.75 for the short stack) and the banana foster pancakes ($5.95 for the short stack) as well.  I always get a side of their crispy bacon ($3.95) too.  Come here to treat your taste buds to a delicious breakfast!",

    "text": "AMBIANCE: 3 - This location is clean, cute, and pretty busy. But I feel like it's just too small for the amount of people it serves on a daily basis. Even waiting in the front area, it just feels like there's not enough space for everyone to walk through--especially since where you pay is also where you wait.  SERVICE: 4 - Our server was really friendly and helpful. He was fast and didn't want us to rush with eating, even though there were quite a few waiting people. He made us feel comfortable. The food we ordered also came really fast, which was a really nice change from regular waiting times.   FOOD: 3 - Kahlua Pig Benedict: I usually really like Eggs Benedict, so I was really excited about trying one with pulled pork inside. I wasn't that impressed though with this one. I thought that the flavors were missing from my plate and I felt like they forgot to add an ingredient in.   Garlic Fried Rice: I wasn't a fan of the garlic fried rice. It just felt wet, too oily, and the garlic was almost too subtle so that it just tasted like regular rice. It was a pretty big disappointment since people rave about it so much! For me, it just tasted like rice.   **Red Velvet Pancakes (a must try!): The red velvet pancakes and cream cheese syrup that they make at this location are super good. The pancakes are warm and yummy. The way I eat them is I cut the pancake into pieces and dip them in the sauce..because pouring the sauce on does not cover enough of the pancake for me!   It's a pretty sugary breakfast, but damn. It is so good.   Their pancakes are the best, so I'll definitely be coming back to try the other flavors to get my morning sugar high on!",

The receptionist said our wait would be about 20 min. which is pretty standard and usually well worth it, because the food is amazing. The 1 Star is not for the food, it's for the lack of service. There was a party of 11 that walked in roughly about 15 min after we got there and they were seated within 10 minutes. Our name apparently wasn't written on the board when we arrived, which made us appear after the party of 11. Not cool at all. Such an easy task obliterated. You've lost a customer.",

We prefer to eat in but nevertheless they have great food & are reasonably priced. We own a restaurant ourselves & know very well how it is to provide great food & a great experience.  We're also glad to see that they don't do grub hub or any of the other 3rd party services that take 30% of the sale. These people deserve every penny for their hard efforts.

    "text": "I was delighted to discover this restaurant while in town for the week of Thanksgiving.  I typically don't like to eat at restaurants with traditional American breakfast fare as I dislike maple and pancake syrup.  To my surprise they have an awesome selection of pancakes that have enough flavor or toppings hence eliminating the need for syrup.   My family was happy, they got their traditional steak and eggs and chicken fried steak fix. Both husband and daughter said the hash browns were some of the best they've had in forever. Crispy and not loaded with oil.  Both subbed traditional pancakes for the premium pancakes.  He got the German chocolate, she got the Chocolate Chip/cookies and cream (I can't recall what they're called).  I sampled my husbands german chocolate pancakes (which means I totally stole and took over), they were delightful! I ordered the white chocolate macadamia pancakes, while they were good I'd try something different next time.  Our server was awesome and retrieved me some cream cheese topping to sub out the traditional pancake syrup.    Yes there is a wait because this is a small location but it is well worth the wait.  Food was delish and was served piping hot.  Server and busser were attentive during our visit.",

I wanted to try something new so I ordered banana foster pancakes and was happy with my new discovery. The eggs were also good.

BabyStacks is not just a breakfast place, BabyStacks is a way for my boyfriend to convince to me get out of bed on our day off. \"Well, if you come with me to ____, then I'll buy you BabyStacks... chocolate chip pancakesssss\". I must have told at least a thousand people about my love for BabyStacks. I dream about the Spam Scramble with Garlic Rice and I have tried to personally recreate their potatoes and failed so many times. I am a customer for life. I love the servers, I love seeing their familiar faces and even the hostess. I know this is a very dramatic review, but when friends come in town, we go to BabyStacks. Honestly, if I could have them cater my wedding, I'd hire them. I've taken so many photos of their food, it's even been the background on my phone for an extended amount of time. As I'm writing this my coffee has been refilled and I'm just waiting on heaven to land on my table. Peace out, Yelp.",

Once everything arrived I went for the crepe and tasting the rice and thought, yum pretty good but I was craving the spinach Benedict. I go to cut into my poached eggs and they are way over hard. When the server finally came over to check on us (after waiving at them) I showed him my hard boiled eggs and now cold food. My spouse now at this point is about done with her food.

After seeing all the rave reviews we decided to save Babycakes Cafe for a Sunday brunch meal.  YES it was a long wait. We arrived at 10:20am and we were seated about an hour later.  That said...I feel that the wait was worth it. Everything was fresh and delicious.  Our order-  short stack of red velvet pancakes huevos rancheros pulled pork eggs benedict  The RED VELVET PANCAKES are really that fabulous! I'm a huge fan of red velvet anything regardless (so long as it's good cake of course) and I was a little concerned that red velvet pancakes would be too sweet for a brunch item but it was a perfect balance. It definitely had that distinct red velvet taste and smell but it wasn't overly sweet, it still tasted like a pancake. There was a sprinkling of chocolate chips and a small cup of cream cheese frosting syrup...WOW. It was so delicious :) Go to Babycakes Cafe for their delicious pancakes, it's something new, cheap, and I didn't mind the long drive from the Strip.",

The place is small and cramp but clean and so are the bathrooms. We came in at 0800 on a Friday and was seated immediately. Servers were friendly, checked on us often and our food came out quick and hot.  The food.... Rob says his Portuguese sausage eggs and rice was throwback to what we were used to eating in Guam and his orange juice tasted like the canned ones  we were served in school.  Mine was the loco moco, they used a darker gravy than what I'm used too but I did like it a lot. I'm glad they don't use cheap rice here which takes away from the dish like the other island restaurants here do. I don't know which they use but it was not heavy and thick. I got through two of the patties and was stuffed,only got to eat a quarter of my pancakes which is a shame since they were soooo good.",

I've been perfecting my own omelette making skills since I was 11 (I'm now 30) and I enjoy cooking in general... so for me to get out of the house for breakfast, it better be darn good.  That said, I am a regular at BabyCakes Cafe.  The pancakes are far better than I can ever make at home, and they've spoiled me with awesome toppings such as fresh whipped cream (i.e. not that junk from a can)... also not something I would take the time to do at home.  These few negative reviews were clearly written by someone who came once when they were in a bad mood, or for whatever reason had an isolated bad experience.  I have eaten here dozens of times and from that more proper sampling I can say that this place knows how to \"break the fast\" better than anywhere else I have tried in Vegas.  I usually don't care much for taking the time to write reviews (I know, I'm a jerk), but I am taking the time to create a yelp login just so I can review BabyCakes because it's that good... and everyone I bring there loves it.",

The only disappointment was I didn't have enough stomach room to down the red velvet AND s'mores pancakes so I had to settle with just the red velvet pancakes and adobe fried rice.  The cream cheese syrup is probably what makes the pancakes delicious-yo...I'm not even a huge fan of red velvet or cream cheese but these were so amazingly decadent that I had to bring a batch back to LA with me.  The fried rice was also yummy and balanced out the sweet pancakes well.  The dining area is small but the staff was so friendly and quick to service to us non-locals. I was impressed at the amount of people that filled up the place at 7:30 am on a Sunday and the place was 100% filled when we left.  One day I may be back if I could find some crazy person who will stay up until it opens, or go to bed early enough to wake up for it. The former sounds like the more fitting option for Vegas, don't you think??",

    "text": "Babycakes, Babycakes, Babycakes...  Red velvet pancakes, red velvet pancakes, red velvet pancakes....  These words have been dancing around in my head for months now ever since I read a bunch of reviews about this place. I finally got the chance this morning to go to Babycakes and discover if all my lingering dreams of RVP's would come True and they definitely did.  My boyfriend and I arrived today (Sunday) at about Noon and the place was packed. I knew as soon as we drove up that we would be waiting, but never the less we were going to eat here no matter what. It ended up being a 30 minute wait, actually not bad for a brunch on a Sunday in my opinion. Would I wait that long during a week day? I'm not so sure.  After our wait we were escorted to a table in their very small dining room. Yes, this place is TINY!   I ordered the Huntington Omelet and I upgraded to the red velvet pancakes ($1.50 to do so), and my boyfriend got the full-stack of RVPs. Okay, so all the hype is True - these pancakes are freaking amazing. My boyfriend said he liked his, but he didn't finish the whole plate. Probably because they're extremely rich.   But here's what I really liked, their omelet and and serving of hasbrowns were perfect sized. Not too much, not too little. It's not like going to IHOP where they bring you out an omelet the size of your head that you're never going to finish. I appreciate that.   The prices were spot-on, the service was super sweet (they kept my coffee filled, always a plus!), and the food was DELISH.   Babycakes, Babycakes, Babycakes,,,,,",

We arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday and waited about 20 minutes for a table. Not too bad considering the size, which is pretty small.  My son ordered the standard Buttermilk pancakes with a side of bacon and I had Honey Whole Wheat pancakes. In a nutshell, everything was terrific! The bacon was thick and generous and the pancakes were a good size and prepared perfectly! I resent not ordering the Red Velvet, after seeing it delivered to the table next to us, but that is what next time is for!  Certainly worth the trip if you're in the city and want to avoid a $40 room service omelet or the ridiculous buffet lines. Can't wait to come back and give it another go!",

I am not talking about my actual review of course, but of the place that I am reviewing.    Babycakes is worth my 200th slot and my 300th and my 400th and so on.  It is that good.  I was visiting Las Vegas from Houston a few weeks back and my family and I wanted to go get some fantastic breakfast.  My fellow yelpers told me to try this place out and after reading the reviews, I decided it was worth the try and the drive from our hotel.  After a bit of complaining from my family as we drove there and found a bit of a wait, the complaining stopped the second they took a bite out of their omelet.  The four of us go different omelets and I decided to get the Macadamia Nut pancakes with my omelet.    \"BEST OMELET I HAVE EVER EATEN!!!\" - Family  \"........mmmmmm.......\" - Me  I am having trouble finding the words to describe the food they have here.  Everything is amazing and the pancakes were RIDICULOUS!!    For example, the food was so good I ended up buying one of their mugs.  Their little Babycake mugs.  Just so I will have a memento of my favorite breakfast place on earth.  Thanks right  MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST PLACE ON EARTH!!!!!!  I feel like going to Vegas, but only for the Babycakes.  Peace",

    "text": "Heard a lot about this place and their red velvet pancakes.  A lot.  We called one morning and asked if there was a wait to gauge if we should attempt this infamous place.  We were told there's no wait, come on down!  So we jumped in the car and got there literally 5 minutes later and there was *surprise* a 25 - 30 minute wait.  There were only 2 parties in front of us, so I figured it would probably be less of a wait.  Well, we ended up waiting 40 minutes.  That put a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth right at the beginning of this experience, going from no wait to a 40 minute wait.  But that's the nature of the restaurant biz, and I wanted those red velvet pancakes!  We ordered.  I ended up getting an omelet and upgraded my bread side to the RVP, my husband got the fried rice adobo, and my mom got the Eggs Benedict.  When the food came out...I was surprised by how crappy it looked.  Sorry to be blunt, but that's how it looked: crappy.  I expected more after hearing so much buzz.  My omelet, which was supposed to have swiss cheese in it, had 2 slices of processed-store-bought-fake-sandwich-slice white stuff barely melted on top.  My potatoes were obviously from a frozen bag and blandly seasoned at that.  My husband didn't mind his fried rice, but said it was very dry.  My mom's eggs benedict was just ok, and it also came with the frozen potatoes.  I couldn't believe the lack of quality.  The RVP were the only saving grace for the place.  They truly are delicious and I'm glad I got to experience them.  However, I definitely would not be able to eat a whole order of them as they are extremely sweet.  So in short: the wait is long, the food is from frozen and processed crap, and the pancakes are delicious.  Would I make a trip back and wait that long just for the pancakes, though? No.",

    "text": "Although it has been on my bookmarks for some time, I am plagued by the Vegas reluctance to drive more than 20 minutes to get to my destination. Going to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North cut the trek in half and gave me a reason to explore this beautiful side of town.  My sister and I thought that we had outsmarted the regular rush but there was still a wait on a Wednesday afternoon. It makes sense since Babycakes can only seat 50 people and has a total of 10-15 tables depending on how they breakdown the seating.   The place is quaint. The hostess/cashier saw us come in and placed us on the list without us having to approach her. Fifteen minutes later we were sat. It took another ten minutes and a few puzzled glances to get a waitress over to take our drink order. Once we were noticed, the service improved.   Between the two of us we shared the lemon ricotta crepe/pancakes and the adobo fried rice. There were three thin cakes, dusted with powder sugar with butter, lemon wedges,maple syrup, and more powder sugar on the side. The crepes were crisp. The traditional lemon and sugar combination was nice. We did not taste the ricotta though. I wished it was thinly layered on each instead of mixed into the batter. My Filipino friends will probably scold me for getting such an easily made dish, but the adobo was decent. It was more salty than sour or sweet, but balanced well with the omelet wrapped around it. Not being a big fan of mayo, we subbed the mac salad for house potatoes. They were seasoned well, but could have been more brown. For both meals, we left satisfied for less than eighteen dollars before tip.",

I don't know how to explain what the white syrup is, but it compliments it really well. It taste similar to the normal frosting of a red velvet cake in syrup form.

I immediately called my best friend Lauren and made a date for the following Sunday morning.  Ok, let me just pause to tell you here, just now, I was thinking about the menu and my MOUTH-WATERED. IRL. JUST HAPPENED. Ok, so not only do they have Red Velvet Pancakes that are served with Whipped Cream, Chocolate Crumbles and CREAM CHEESE SYRUP (more like a not so think icing) but they also have S'MORE Pancakes, Peanut Butter and (Jelly, Banana, Chocolate...you pick) Pancakes and one of my personal favorites, Bacon Pancakes (aka: a one stop shop).   They also offer a variety of traditional breakfast options, as well. We wanted to try the Red Velvet Pancakes but knew that it would be sweet overload so we opted to also get the bacon and eggs breakfast. Their seasoned potatoes need a little more seasoning but other than that, delicious. A great savory balance to our sweetest ever breakfast.   The place is totally CHARMING with high-top tables, flowers and a GREAT waitstaff. I spilled my drink all over our table (in typical Katie fashion) and we had 2-3 staff members come over to help us clean it up.  The best part was as we were wrapping up (our $20 bill....bang for your breakfast buck!), Andi and Austin, who recommended the place to me, walked in the door. Andi said she had woken up saying \"Pumpkin Pankcakes....\" and they headed out the door.   I'll be heading out the door every weekend to my new favorite breakfast place.",

    "text": "Time Matters!  We tried this place for the 1st time last recently.  The hostess needs help with her perception of time and service.  I showed up with my family and was told 30-35 minutes was the wait to be seated.  The place was packed and decided to take a chance on the wait.  It was in a shopping center and we weren't going to wait outside with 3 kids.  I took the kids to go sit in the car while my wife went an picked up an item at a nearby story in the center.  After 15 minutes, I asked my daughter to go check and see how the wait was going.  She came running back saying that they had called us several times and we needed to go or we would lose our spot.  I grabbed the kids an ran into the restaurant; however, the hostess asked if we were all together and I told her No, but my wife will be here in a moment.  The hostess said, \"I can't seat you unless you are all together.\"  I replied with, \"You are going to seat us and if I need order for my wife, I can since I know what she likes.\"  The hostess told me, No again. I told her that we would not be in this predicament if she would have been more accurate on her time.  So, she sat us down.  Some may be excited that to see that they wait wasn't as long as suggested, but when you're juggling 5 people.  That task is not as easy as one might seem.  Luckily the food was okay.  But due to the service at the beginning, I have no intention of returning.  I wish I recalled her name, but it was an older woman with a grumpy attitude and who likes to yell.  A hostess is a critical component of a dining experience.  They are the first person the customer sees and the last one too.  Centennial doesn't have many good breakfast options, but I don't mind traveling 10 miles to get the experience I expect.",

Service was good even though they were busy. Restaurant looked clean. Dining area is not very huge. This wouldn't be the location I would pick for a big group. 2 person tables are kind of small for all the plates and stuff they bring out for breakfast. Skillet was good, pancakes were great. They have a bunch of specialty pancakes too.  It's a must try if you are a pancake fan",

    "text": "If your favorite cake flavor is Red Velvet, the Red Velvet Pancakes will hit home for you like it did for me. I'm a Red Velvet fanatic so I was in immediate heaven as soon as I took my first bite. I am typically not a fan of extras like whipped cream or chocolate chip toppings, but I welcomed each and every savory bite. This menu item also came with its own cream cheese syrup but I felt like the pancakes were so fresh and perfectly done that it didn't need any extras. I even ended up eating the entire thing after my Spam & Scrambled Eggs order!  This is definitely one of my top breakfasts spots. I can't wait to come back again to try the rest of the menu. The place is small, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are already considering an expansion or additional locations because it was so busy when we got there. No wonder this place is so popular, the food is great, service is served with a smile and everyone is very friendly!",

My Opinion/Story: I got the groupon special and prepared myself for when I go to Vegas. I had an agenda to check this place out and I was happy to have made it here.  Of course I got their red velvet pancakes but as good as it sounds, it wasn't enough for me. We got two medium size pancakes and it made me crave for more.  Thank goodness I ordered an omelette and another got their White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes. Now that was delicious. I guess I like all the ingredients in that one.  Hubby got their Adobo Omelette which was different but also good.  Service was good, friendly, quick. I like this place.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  being that this place is the hottest ish on yelp i hadddd to try it.   on a friday around noon there was no wait for 4 people. yay!   i had the loco moco which comes with 2 eggs, gravy, 2 home made hamburger patties, rice, and mac salad. let's start with the good. eggs were cooked just right and the gravy was reallllly good. the hamburger patties were just okay. it seemed like they had been pre-cooked and re-heated. the meat was very tough. it was like a day old bbq hamburger patty. i'm used to the really tender thin hamburger patties so this may just be preference. the mac salad was not good to me at all. there was a lot of black pepper and something else i couldn't quite figure out. i shared this with a friend but it really wasn't enough food to share. he didn't like the mac salad either but enjoyed everything else.  sooo the real reason why i came here was to try the red velvet pancakes everyone is talking about. and yes. it lives up to the hype! the pancakes are very light, fluffy, and not overly sweet. the whipped cream on top seems home made and can be compared to a marshmallow flavor. yum! the cream cheese syrup is sweet and has the perfect syrupy consistency.   my other friends shared eggs benedict and half was done well and the other half was overcooked. they also got regular pancakes and really like them.   overall service was friendly but on the slow side. it took a while to get our food. the tables are set up in a way where it's very congested and it's not a great place for groups if you have more than 6 people.   i absolutely fell in love with the red velvet pancakes but i'm not sure if i would come back for their lunch.",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying I love BabyStacks. My boyfriend is a huge Cragged Egg fan (which I am not) so getting him to even try this was a struggle. The first time I finally convinced him to give it a try he ordered the chicken fried steak. It was okay, he of course preferred the one at cracked egg, and after tasting it, I agreed. After coming back a next time, he tried the mexican skillet. That's his new go-to. I'm giving only 3 stars because of the service. Coming in for sit down, theres never a problem. Lately we've only been in the mood for take out & its only a minute drive from Desert Shores. The past 2 times we've been, the take out service has been horrible.I don't think I'll be ordering from BabyStacks anymore due to our past 2 experiences. First time, we called in to order the mexican skillet to share. The hostess said it would be about 15-20 minutes. We got there about 20 mins later, thinking we would actually be late because although they say 15-20 mins, it usually never is. It took an additional 20 mins for our food to come out!!!!! 40 mins for takeout on one item? okay, I get it, they're busy.. but PLEASE give me an according time. It bugged me, but I understand it happens, so I let it go. A few weeks later we decided to order the same thing. We called in and its the same 15-20 mins. We got there in about 17 and were greeted by a new hostess. We told her we were here for pickup but she informed us the hostess was in the bathroom and she had not learned the system to cash us out yet (not her fault). So instead of waiting in front of the tiny cashier table because people were sitting on the bench to our left, we took a step back to give the people some room. Upon waiting 5 mins, a group of ladies walked up to the cashier to check out and stood in front of us. While the new hostess watched. My boyfriend wanted to say something but I told him to not to, reassuring him that the new hostess would tell the other hostess that we were there first. 5-6 mins later the hostess came out. I decided to try to inform her that we were there first(nicely) while she was walking towards us just incase the new girl forgot. I started out with \"Hi....\" and immediately got cut off with a \"I'll be right with you\" Being a hostess for 4 years and now a server, I thought that was extremely rude. So she proceeds to the cash register and starts checking out the ladies who stood in front of us, while the new girl watched and didn't say anything. Of course they wanted to spilt their bill. Another 4 minutes. After receiving our food, we took a bite in the car because I was starving, and to no surprise found our food to be extremely cold. The ladies cutting in front of us was not the hostess' fault, but to cut me off trying to tell her, is. I was so upset after this experience; it bugged me so bad I highly doubt I will be returning. Not for a good while at least.",

My hubby got the spam scramble and we got a short stack of bacon pancakes to share.  We both liked the spam scramble the most... so simple, yet so delicious!   The kahlua pig itself was also good, though I'd have to say, as a benedict with the hollandaise sauce, the two flavors were competing with each other.  And they didn't quite go together, in my opinion.  The bacon pancake was just okay too. I had such high hopes for it, since I love both things.  I was hoping the bacon was crumbled inside the pancake, but it was more like two strips of bacon plopped onto a cooking pancake. The pancake also seemed too fluffy to me.  Maybe as a meal on its own, it would've been delicious, but since we already ate other entrees before trying it, it became too much.  I give 4 stars overall, because the service was superb, and there are so many more things I want to try from their menu!",

She wasted the corned beef because she didn't like it.  I enjoyed my Cinnabon pancakes.  I would recommend ordering the short stack with a side dish.

There was about a 15 minute wait when we got there (noon on a Monday). The place is pretty small so the wait times are to be expected. The menu is pretty big. They have about 12 different kinds of specialty pancakes, omelettes, crepes, breakfast items and a few lunch selections.  I ordered the omelette which came with 2 pancakes that I of course upgraded to Red Velvet for an additional charge. The omelette was delicious and the breakfast potatoes were pretty good as well. I saved the best for last: The Pancakes. It was like dessert and breakfast all in one. The cream cheese \"syrup\" is more like icing but it gives the pancakes the real RV feel. The pancakes themselves aren't too sweet so it is a perfect balance.  Next time I want to try the S'mores pancakes but that's a whole different review. :)",

Good experiences, waitstaff is very friendly and prompt. The smallness does detract, like other reviewers have noted. It can be a little loud too. Check it out if you are in the mood for pancakes and have some time to kill.",

    "text": "Oh, how the mighty have fallen!  I arrived here around 8:10am and was seated relatively promptly.  My order was taken and water on my table by 8:15am.  This is where this turned from a great experience to a bad one.    I know that this is a relatively small eatery.  It's a mom and pop type business.  The pancakes were good--  a tad too chocolatety... More so than I remember, but I could have just been in a bad mood after waiting 1/2 hour for pancakes.  Are you kidding me?  I'm a solo diner.  I watch full stacks brought out to the table to the right of me and short stacks to my left--literally.  If it didn't take me 1/2 hour to get there, I would have left.  Finally, my waitress notices \"Hmmm... I think she probably came here to eat\" and asked the kitchen where my food was.  They start to argue about if it was put in or not.  I'm thinking, \"Hey, I'm sitting right next to you guys. Can you be more discrete?\"  So they start making the pancakes.  Do I get an apology, an explanation, a \"are you still doing alright\", \"your food will be out in a bit\", or at least some water in my empty glass? You guessed it... No!  That was the insulting part.  Look, I eat out a lot.  I do probably more than I should.  I know that things happen and mistakes are made.  That's absolutely fine.  There will be some human error.  What is not acceptable is keeping the patron in the dark-- especially if I can hear the whole he said/she said conversation... This right here is where restaurants are defined, and this place failed miserably.  To add insult to injury, they put the check on my table literally 3 minutes after I got my food.  I eat fast but really?  Again, really?  You've got to be kidding me.    I WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS PLACE AGAIN!  They need to hire someone to teach them how to run front of house or at least get some manners.",

I used to wait tables you are a jerk if you do this and stay long after the establishment you are bs'ing in has closed. Now I told my friend we weren't going to be a jerks like that.  Despite us rolling in the girl who took care of us was really cool about it.  I told her upfront we would tip her well.  This is a Vegas must if you don't leave the strip to get here you are missing out big time.  I'm not even going to get into it all's I'm saying is I was impressed and this is a foodie breakfast heaven! Carry your a$$ on over there.",

YUUUUUM-ME!  totally be prepared for the wait.  it's a wait.  they tell everyone 20 minutes and it can carry over 30.  the place is small and with a million people waiting to get in, it's obvious why there's a wait.  i can't wait till this thing spreads like wildfire and chains open.. or they make it bigger.. we definitely need one of these babies in the southwest area!!!  *hint *hint!",

They had many flavors like lemon ricotta, peanut butter, strawberry and we had a hard time choosing. We decided to go with red velvet and carrot cake pancakes. Both were awesome and served with a cream cheese syrup. One suggestion for them, selfishly speaking, would be to create a pancake sampler to give customers an opportunity to try a variety of their flavors. We had to order two separate dishes just so we could taste more than one of their flavors.",

Thanks to all the positive Yelp reviews, we decided to go on an adventure  and check out this place.  We were not disappointed!  Warning....the restaurant is small so expect to wait.  We noticed that there were several empty tables while we were waiting.  Maybe this is to allow the wait staff to provide all their customers outstanding service.  Hubby ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  The omelette is stuffed with shredded chicken meat and rice.  Served with your choice of Mac salad or potatoes.  Huge!    I had Portuguese Sausage, Rice and Eggs which is served with your choice of BabyStacks pancakes or toast.  I upgraded to garlic rice and Red Velvet pancakes. Mmm...mm good.  Don't scrimp, it's worth the extra charge.  Red Velvet Pancakes are a definite must!  Portions are generous.  Come hungry!",

The cream cheese syrup is a bit on the sweet side, but it paired perfectly with the flavor of the pancakes - regular maple would not be nearly as good.    The Eggs Benedict was also very good, although the ham was a little on the tough side.  There can be a super long wait here and they aren't always accurate with their quote times.  We were quoted 20 min and ended up waiting 45 min for a table.  They had many tables clear of people, but the one busser couldn't keep up to get people seated quickly.  They could get a lot more business if their service was ran more efficiently.    Nonetheless, I would return for the fantastic food!",

So one Saturday morning we decide we'd check out Babycakes.  I do happen to love red velvet cakes when done right so were looking forward to the red velvet pancakes, even though I'm not a pancake fan.  Anyhow, we arrive at about 11:30 on a Saturday and the wait is 45mins, okay, we say, let's hope it was worth it.  It wasn't too bad, the actual wait time was about 30mins and we were seated.  There was all types of people, lots of families.  I order the Kahlua pig Benedict and half order of velvet pancakes, the mister got something ( can't recall so it was probably not that memorable) and banana pancakes.  He said his was just okay, but he tried my velvet pancakes and fell in love.  My Kahlua pig was so good, it had cabbage and shredded pork, just the right amount of hollandaise.  My velvet pancakes is were I was hooked, which is a lot for me considering I am not a fan of pancakes.  The pancake was soft and warm and the cream cheese syrup had just the right amount of sweetness....Babycakes has made me a fan of breakfast!  I will definitely be back, next time with my daughter cause I know she will be hooked just like her mama!",

I fired up the yelp and it was between that and some other spot but these pictures from here won me over!   I don't know Vegas and what part we were in but getting there was almost nuts because it was flooded getting there. Damn storm in Vegas kinda ruined my Vegas mojo. Oh well. So found the spot in a shopping center next to a donut shop I wanted to get a donut BUT the food coma after this orgasmic meal stopped that LOL.   Since this was a weekday brekie, we didn't have to deal with the weekend rush that I kept reading about, so :p Walked in and sat at the counter so I can watch some tv while stuffin my face. The service was good . We had a dude that I think may have ran the place himself or family. Anywho scaled the menu and was drooling over the options. So typical me :D  Finally  we figured out what we wanted after trying to figure it out for damn near 15 minutes. My fault HA!     I opted for the build your own skillet. With the eggs ,spinach,bacon,mushrooms and cheese. Under that is a bed of breakfast potatoes. I also added two red velvet pancakes for an additional charge. Still came with toast OH LAWRD LOL. Pic ordered the Ricks adobo fried rice and also we did a side of portugeuse sausage and kailua pork. Man this sounds like were some mad fat asses LOL.  So im getting excited for all this food to come out. Thank god we had the whole counter to ourselves HAHA. We start piggin out. My skillet was delish BUT I didn't care for all the potatoes under my fixins. I like hashbrowns much more than breakfast spuds. The eggs were nice and fluffy. I could have used more cheese but im a cheesehead LOL. The red velvet pancakes were CRACK! Thats pretty much did my tummy in! I kept eating them and eating them and eating them. I usually hate pancakes but these were OMAZING. The cream cheese syrup was so damn good! The chunks of chocolate chip with the batter and syrup made it a perfect bite! Damn now im starting to day dream about those.  The portueguese sausage was a good amount and cooked perfectly. The kailua pork was a lacking something, some kind of brown au jus with a touch of sweetness would have made it more enjoyable. His dish was  good as well but not the best fried rice. But still good and he ate it all!    We walked out stuffed as hell and we were going to go shopping BUT I couldn't take knowing that I would have to walk amongst the crowds, so I said F it take me back to my room so I can sleep LOL. Can't wait to come back here!!!!!!",

Today, along with three family members, I ate at a friends brand-spankin' NEW restaurant called Babycakes Cafe on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  I find myself rendered speechless; it was so FANTASTIC! We're a sharing family, the only way to eat out in my opinion, so I was able to try a little bit of everything.  ~If you like a little KICK, eat the Portuguese sausage! ~Rick's adobo fried rice and eggs with macaroni salad.......WTF?  FANTASTIC!  ~Perfectly cooked over-medium eggs! ~Hash browns.....YAY, HASH BROWNS! ~Benny's, oh how I love thee....! ~Lastly, pancakes...........my favorite food of all time!           *Red Velvet- Better than actual cake!         *Bacon- So delish!         *CARROT CAKE- (SIGH) These are hands down the GREATEST             pancakes that I have ever eaten!  I am without words..........!  You'd be doing yourself a favor if you go to Babycakes Cafe! =)",

Ordered the banana cream pancakes, garlic fried rice, adobo chicken omelette and kalua pig rice. WOWWWW talk about DELICIOUS! I've had the banana cream pancakes before and I actually like them more than the red velvet pancakes, not saying the red velvet pancakes aren't good because they also deserve 5 stars but the I just LOVEEEE banana cream anything! The food was quick, delicious and so original! I wish I could have taken food home or wish there was a spot like this in Cali.  Definitely a must if you can get your ass off the strip! Reasonably priced too!  Total spent $free.99 (Bill was a little over $30 but my friends got me)",

When it came to ordering our food the service was friendly and quick. My hub ordered the eggs benedicts and I ordered the basic 2 egg breakfast with potatoes, bacon nothing out of the ordinary. I also tried some of the pancakes and wasn't impressed, but I'm not really a pancake person to begin with.  The prices in this joint seem to be fair for what your getting, but I don't see myself  making my way back any time soon because it just didn't make a lasting impression on me.",

Clearly, they need a bigger restaurant since we weren't the only ones leaving due to their lack of ability to accommodate weekend traffic.",

Service: This place is always busy, so it took them about no more than ten minutes to get us seated. I'm not complaining because there are other days where the wait is an hour (sometimes, more). Anyway, the servers here are always very nice and prompt. Ours was definitely perfect to us today; she was wonderful! They check on you often, and they don't take forever just to serve you or bring you your drinks/food. A+ for their service, seriously. I've never been disappointed.  Food: They have a lot of Hawaiian-Filipino-American fused food items on their menu, so I love that this place is very original for that. I ordered 3 spam and eggs over easy with garlic fried rice & hash browns on the side. I also upgraded my pancake. They're known for their delicious red velvet pancakes with whipped cream and cocoa powder sprinkled on top with cream cheese syrup (yum yum), so of course I upgraded to that. (Almost) Everything came out delicious and hot! However, I wasn't the biggest fan of their garlic fried rice. The rice was really oily and the garlic tasted burnt... I don't like wasting food that I paid for, so I ate it anyway. But I have learned my lesson. Other than the rice, the rest of my food was delicious!  Overall experience: I really do enjoy this place. It's one of my favorite places to go eat at. It's affordable, inexpensive, and delicious. Service is great. The food is delicious. But never again with the garlic fried rice.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I gave this place a try last weekend after hiking in the Red Rock Canyons. We have been trying to eat somewhat healthy, and this showed up under a search for 'healthy breakfast' haha well after reading about red velvet pancakes, all bets were off. We turned on the GPS and headed over.  We waited for quite awhile, probably a half hour or so, because of the fact that it was Saturday at around 11:30. We really hit the rush because right when we sat down, like four or five tables got up and they didn't get re-seated (do we stink or something!?)  The menu looked INCREDIBLE. Banana cream pie pancakes, carrot cake pancakes, orange creamsicle pancakes, SMORES pancakes, and I believe cookies and cream pancakes (there were plenty others but these stuck out to me). We had choice overload, because every single one sounded unbelievable. Since we also read about the homemade corned beef hash, I also wanted to try that.  We ended up getting the meal that comes with eggs, corned beef hash, and a couple of pancakes, and ordering a separate short stack as well. We got the short stack of red velvet, and the other 2 were banana cream pie.  Well, first, the corned beef hash was FANTASTIC. I would come back just to have that for breakfast again. For some reason I was craving it, and man did it hit the spot.   The red velvet pancakes were probably the best I ever had, and mostly because of the creamcheese sauce they put on top. If I wasn't 'eating healthy' I would have asked for some extra, because that would have made it the best thing in the whole world.  The banana cream pie ones were also really good, but my girlfriend felt they tasted a bit too artificial. I personally really liked them.   The bill was something like 20 bucks, and for 2 people including coffees, we were more than happy with that. The two woman that were at the front were also really friendly, and chatted with us about our experience afterwards.  Great value, great breakfast, and incredible pancakes. Will definitely be back again.",

The restaurant is small! There are other locations, I went to the one at Buffalo and Smoke Ranch. Expect to wait on a Sunday (even with football at 1pm) but I promise it's worth it!  I couldn't decide on what to get. Red Velvet Pancakes are their best seller, but chocolate isn't really my thing.  Everyone around me ordered them...they must be good. I was torn between lemon ricotta, hazelnut and banana cream pie pancakes...(they need a sampler plate! For real!) I asked my waiter, Mike, his suggestion and he told me lemon ricotta was the way to go. Delicious!! But the pancakes are way HUGE. I mean huge. Bigger than your head. Think the size of a large dinner plate. The short stack is three pancakes. I went famished but finished about half.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were thin halfway between a pancake and a crepe and had a nice lemony taste. I squeezed on some fresh lemon and butter and dipped them in cream cheese syrup (WHAT???) and had a foodgasm.   I am going back to try some more!  My bill came to $16.50. Very reasonable.  I had coffee, oj, short stack of pancakes, and a side of scrambled eggs. I'd probably skip the eggs, not great...and since the pancakes are so huge I wouldn't have needed them if I'd known.",

Wait was long so don't come hAngry! Service was decent. Not that it was bad or anything but it was just OK - wouldn't go out of my way when I come back to Vegas. Maybe should've tried the red velvet pancakes as that seems to be the rave in most reviews.",

    "text": "We've tried to eat at BabyStacks several times, but the line was always too long. Today was my husband's birthday, so we decided we'd go no matter how long the wait. We got there a little after 8, and luckily there was no line at all! (Not the case when we left, though. I guess if you come after 9, you're out of luck.)  I had the adobo fried rice omelet with a side of red velvet pancakes. The birthday boy had the country eggs benedict with hash browns. All were excellent -- even better than anticipated! My omelet was chockful of chicken and rice, and the marinade made the chicken taste almost like pork. (It reminded me of my grandma's pork-fried rice, and that's a good thing!) The only bad thing I can say is that I loved the adobo so much that I can't imagine ordering anything else. (Maybe a different side dish, although the red velvet pancakes were delicious.)  This place is tiny, which is part of the reason why there's usually a line out front. But the main reason for the wait is that the food is just that good. Maybe next time we'll come with  friends so we can try some of the other dishes on the menu. It's definitely worth the wait!",

It's a small place and right now very trendy so be prepared to wait.  I found their red velvet pancakes a but too sweet and definitely overrated.  I love red velvet but when you add in the chocolate chips and their icing it was just too sweet.  It was better without all the other stuff but then slightly dry.  Liked their buttermilk pancakes more.  Nice and moist and delicious with the butter and syrup.  Believe I also got corned beef hash - it was very good but the potatoes with it were meh.",

They drizzle Nutella with whipped cream and chopped hazelnuts on top! Plus the fresh strawberries made it even better! Every single bite was delicious..I actually finished the short stack! I don't think I could ever order a full order though! A short stack is perfect! I ended up ordering two different sides of potatoes, the hash browns and the breakfast potatoes. Both were good but I will probably stick to the breakfast potatoes next time! I spent about $14 for a short stack with strawberries and two breakfast sides and was not upset about it.

Their red velvet pancakes are awesome - you can never go wrong with those.  The cookies and cream and banana foster pancakes are great also.  There eggs and meats are just like any other breakfast place, but the reason to go there is for the pancakes.   Get there before 8:00 AM to avoid the wait on the weekends.  It's worth getting up early!",

I have never had a single bad experience till today. I ordered the Chili Moco, new item on the the menu and it sounded interesting. Came out barely warm. Waiter not in sight for quiet some time. My  daughter who I was having lunch with had to go to the bathroom. Cant put off a toddler going to the bathroom, so we got up and went. By the time we got back, my food was ICE COLD. I could see why since the restaurant was FREEZING.  I Finally got the waiter and informed him of the situation. He did ask if I would like it heated up ( microwaved eggs... YUCK!) or remade. I let him know I was on my lunch and had to get back. My family was already finished with their meal by this time. I was a little upset to see that I was charged for a) something I did not consume and b) something that was not to my satisfaction.  After further talking to a \"Manager\", I was told that it was my fault the food was cold and that they normally don't take items off but this will be a one time thing. Like really? It was my fault the food was barely warm to begin with and I don't have the time to wait for them to make me another dish. I inform my server as soon as he was around. I did my end, sorry I was an inconvenience. Never have I felt so talked down to for something I have no control over.",

I swear they get their eggs from some super secret chicken farm in Narnia or something because their omelettes and skillets and spam and eggs are delicious. By the way, LOVE that they serve spam and eggs.  Brings me back home so it's really nice.  And their seasoned potatoes are out of this world. I don't really feel like I need to say anything about the red velvet pancakes, just walk in and look at all the articles on the wall.  The staff is great.  It helps that I discovered a long lost friend works there.  They're really prompt and friendly and I enjoy very much eating there.   I could have brunch there every single day.  I may suit up for it next time.",

    "text": "We decided to try out this little cafe strictly based on the Yelp reviews. We are so happy we did. Although the wait was a bit long, we are used to waits from other happening spots like The Bagel Cafe, Hash House-a-Go-Go and The Omelet House. So, 20 minutes wasn't too bad, if I was starving, yes, it would not have been good.   The cafe is little, and there were a couple large parties that definitely slowed things down a bit. I'm not sure if there is a best time to come but it was worth the wait.  We had the red velvet pancakes (to die for), the honey french toast (deliciously large and savory) and the s'mores pancakes (divine!)   We also shared an omelet with cheese, bacon and sausage and potates.   The former Becker restaurant is closed - maybe they can take that place over so there's more seats and less of a wait - just a thought :)   Overall, we were very happy and full! We would definitely come back again. The cafe is quaint and you feel like you are at a local's spot, which is always very nice. This is definitely a once a month treat because I can only imagine how many calories are associated with food that tastes so heavenly!   Yay Babycakes!",

    "text": "Yes, the red velvet pancakes are awesome--make sure you ask for extra cream cheese \"syrup\". But....there is no way I could eat a stack of them for breakfast!   So we went at lunch time and ordered a stack for dessert! I will admit that they were just the tiniest bit dry but once you pour on that delicious cream cheese syrup, it didn't matter. We thought they might have been just a tiny bit better if they had mini chocolate chips in them (ala red velvet bundts at Nothing Bundt Cakes). We shared the Kalua pulled pork grilled cheese which was solid. Really good pulled pork with muenster and cheddar grilled on sourdough.  The fries were crispy but my son said they reminded him of the Ore Ida frozen fries that are marketed as \"extra crispy fast food fries\". He's right, that's totally what the fries are like. But not terrible.  Youngest kid had a kids meal of scrambled egg, bacon, and hash browns with a s'more pancake on the side. Pretty standard fare except for the amazing pancake. It's a pancake with marshmallows, melts chocolate chips, graham cracker crumbs and marshmallow fluff.  So yum.  We went on a weekday close to 11am and had to wait close to 30 minutes. I'm sure weekends are crazy. Our server was great (and cute!) and very apologetic when our red velvet pancakes were delayed due to another server swiping them.   We'll be back every time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "I drive by here a lot but I never really wanted to eat here. But, when my mom came to town she kept noticing the sign whenever we drove by. She thought the girl on the sign was cute and she also thought it looked like Heidi from the classic Japanese series: \"The Girl of the Alps\". So after seeing that, she really wanted to eat here.   I really think that BabyStacks is one of those places that could be the next Starbucks... What I mean is that if they tried to franchise and expand, we could be seeing one of these BabyStacks locations in just about every shopping center.  They should try to expand to California or something..  I am a big fan of those Hawaiian-Filipino style pancakes. They are pretty hard to find on the mainland(outside Hawaii). So I was very happy to find out that they had one of these places only walking distance from where I live. I was not disappointed when I showed up.   The country gravy here is the best I have ever had. It's not that canned stuff, they make there own gravy here with bacon, milk, and flour. The biscuits & gravy and the chicken fried steak are the best things they got here.   The customer service is superb. They got very social and friendly workers here.   The only problem I have with this place is that they don't open for dinner. I'd be here almost every night if they opened late.  Also want to address Kevin A's review of this place. His profile is here: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=87TJFieNsGOTFGsaTDegwQ\">yelp.com/user_details?us...</a> If it isn't annoying enough that he runs around and gives every single local restaurant in the summerlin/north west area a 1-star rating, claiming they have \"bugs\" and \"insects\"... he gave this place one star because he didn't like that there were \"too many Asian's here\". And according to this profile  the dumbass is married to a mail order Filipino woman...what a loser! Get the F*ck out!    5-Stars to BabyStacks. It's the best Filipino-American restaurant around. It's so good, I'd even recommend it to the King of the Philippines(aka Manny Pacquaio) if by some chance I ever met him.",

I do not know who they have cooking in the back, or running this place but it is wonderful. Friendly staff too. A little bit of a wait as place is small, but absolutely worth it! Salsa was good.

    "text": "First and foremost, I love that Baby Stacks is a family owned business. They are obviously doing well since they now have 4 locations in town. I have heard nothing but good things about this place and was finally so excited to be able to try it. I was most looking forward to the famous babystack pancakes. I do think I will be the odd man out when I say that this place was just A-OK though.  The bf and I wandered in for a late brunch around 2pm, and we were seated right away. This place is super small, so I can see how there would be a wait during peak hours which is from 9a-12p Sat and Sun. They take to-go orders, but not during peak hours so be advised. They are open 7 days a week from 7a-2p on weekdays and 7a-3p on weekends.   I ordered the loco moco with garlic fried rice (+$1) and for my side I upgraded to a small baby stack and got the red velvet pancakes. My boyfriend had the piglet omelette with seasoned potatoes and toast. The loco moco is a Hawaiian dish which has 2 burger patties topped with 2 eggs and brown gravy, all sitting on a bed of rice. I loved the garlic fried rice, it was soo tasty and went well with the rest of my food. The burger patties were underseasoned, but the gravy was really flavorful and definitely made the dish come together. I tried the pancakes the minute they arrived at my table. This should be a dessert they were soo sweet. They were good though, but I didn't think they lived up to the hype. They were topped with whipped cream and cream cheese syrup which came in a little cup on the side. I did really enjoy the cream cheese syrup and found myself scraping the little cup to get the last bit of it onto my cakes.   My boyfriend's omelette was 4 eggs stuffed with bacon, sausage, ham and cheddar. He also added jalapenos for a small charge. While it was plentiful, it was nothing memorable. It was $23 for both of us which I though was very reasonable. We only ordered waters though so drinks would have been a bit more. I plan to come back and try some other yummy pancake flavors, especially the lemon ricotta and the banana cream pie.",

Ordered the Rocky Road pancakes.  All were really good.  My friend had the red velvet pancakes, which are really sweet.  I want to try so much more, some other time.  Expect about a 30-45 minute wait for a table.  It's a small place.  Worth it.",

We're vacationing up from SoCal, staying over at the Marriott  and just picked this place to drop by.  Food was a great value - tasted great, came pretty darn fast, but seriously, if I lived here I'd be in there every week just to go in and have a waitress like Danielle bring me my food. If you're a waitress and you're in the service industry,  you wonder why you don't get tips or you wonder why your tits aren't big enough, come on by here and take a look at how it's done!  just unbelievable! Whoever is running the place,  I hope you're paying her enough because this gal is not going to be here forever!! What a gem!!",

The food tastes like they were homecooked...and I don't have to do the dishes afterwards.  They have \"exciting\" pancakes that are worth trying like rocky road, s'mores, and cinnabun. Gone are the days of boring old commercialized pancakes.",

It is also the first pancake listed on the menu, so it must be their signature item. The red velvet pancakes were so delightfully sweet and tasty that no syrup was needed. The combination of the oozing butter, the melted chocolate crumbles, and the whipped cream  added up to some of the best pancakes I've ever tasted.   i also ordered the Adobo Fried Rice which also comes with a small macaroni salad. They wrap the rice in an egg, resembling an omurice. I think they added too much soy sauce to my rice, because it was quite salty.   Friendly service and atmosphere. If I ever have a craving for pancakes here in Vegas, I definitely know where to go :)",

We also ordered an omlete which was tasty added avocado.   now lets talk pancakes! Now I am all about pancakes and I got the smores but cant wait to go back and try rocky road. We also ordered strawberry pancakes which were delightful.   To top it off (no pun intended) the service here feels like home. They were always topping off the coffee, making sure we were taking care and the servers represented everything hospitality. The price point was amazing.

The hostess sat every table that walked in after us before seating us. And no they didn't have a call ahead or they were not waiting outside. When I asked her about it she just apologized. But while sitting every table she made sure to avoid eye contact with me. Then when we got sat our server you could see just got double sat, which again was fine we were not in a rush. But to hear him give his speech and introduce himself to his other tables, then to walk over to us and say \"what do you want to eat\" and not even as to check on us one time. My steak was over cooked, my potatoes were unseasoned, and the buttermilk pancakes were flavorless and cold. Then when we went up to pay the other hostess asked how everything was and when I said terrible all she said was \"okay your total is blah blah blah\". What a horrible place filled with incompetent people. I regret wasting my time and money here. Never again.",

The wait for seating didn't take too long at all on a Thursday morning. When we were sat, they took our drink orders promptly and then our server eventually came to see us. She came and saw us pretty frequently, which I appreciated, especially since members of my party had to look through the extensive menu. When we ordered, it didn't take too long for our food to come out, which was pretty amazing. The food tasted just like how I was expecting. I'm glad the food quality and taste is consistent among the different locations. Babystacks regardless of location, is an amazing place to eat!",

This place being nearby my school I wandered in one morning and I was pleasantly surprised. The place holds a decent amount of tables, no hole in the wall, but there's elbow room. It's not suffocating, and the food is fantastic. I came in here twice this month, once ordering lunch and once ordering breakfast. Both meals were excellent! I tried their cry baby jalapeno burger, don't let the name fool you it's quite mild but it was cooked to perfection and I love their fries! They have a light batter on them but it's pretty light and they were perfectly crispy! Breakfast was even good, baby chick skillet was great, most places can't do spinach without that bitter taste, this place nailed it. I will be back everytime I'm in this neck of the woods hands down. My only drawback is their pancake gimmick. An entire side of the menu of pancakes ranging from the typical blueberry to the outright insane orange creamsicle. The breakfast came with a side of pancakes and that was truly the worst part of either trip. They are VERY dense and cakey. If you like that then great go for it, but I wasn't a fan. I won't let pancakes stop me coming back, though. This has got to be one of my new morning favorites!",

I don't know if I will be back and if I do it will just be for the food.   I called them at 1pm to see what time their last seating was since they close early on Mondays at 2pm. The employee I spoke to on the phone was so rude. I live clear across town (20-25 mins) and called because I didn't want to be refused service after a long drive. I asked the girl on the phone when their last seating was and this is how our convo went   Me: \"hi I was just wondering what time you guys stop seating\" Hostess: \"we close at 2 so any time before that\" Me: \"okay are you sure if I show up at 1:55 you guys will seat us\" Hostess: \"that's before 2, right?\" Me: \"okay I was just making sure because we are on our way right now\"  So we show up to the doors at 1:50, a time before 2.... right?! And guess what the girl tells us?! Any guesses?   \"Oh I'm sorry we are actually closed right now\"  Hahaha and in my head I'm like youre f*cking kidding me right? So we ask to talk to a manager and this girl brings out a little teenager and she was trying to tell me to my face \"no we didn't get a call\" \"nope that was a different location\" so rudely and then she asks the girl who brought her out to me \"did you get a call?\" And she says \"yes\" lmao. Oh management, these kids running the business are going to ruin it for you. The fact they had no empathy for the mistake they made was mind blowing.   If I ever come back to Babystacks it will be for the food and you bet your ass this service doesn't deserve a tip. But honestly I think I will have to boycott red velvet pancakes for a while *kanye shrug*",

The guy told us it would be a 40 minute wait but we didn't wait more than 20 mins. It is very clean and bright inside!  We ordered a full stack of chocolate chip pancakes with the Huntington omelet. Everything was delicious!! The only thing i would say is the full stack was way too much!! The service was friendly and fast!",

    "text": "BabyStacks is solid gold!  They have multiple locations (5 if I'm not mistaken), but this is the only one I've been to, as of the time of writing this review.  So far we've tried: Country Benedict, Country Fried Steak, Patty Melt, and their famous Red Velvet Pancakes.  Everything was stellar! My favorites are the Country Benedict and the Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm not a huge sweets person, especially not for breakfast, but their RV Pancakes were unbelievably good. I kept taking bite after bite, thinking how are these so damn good? Hands-down, best pancakes I've ever had!  Their gravy is terrific, so anything smothered in it, like their biscuits and gravy, Country Fried Steak or Country Benedict are great dishes to try.  Whatever you end up ordering, do yourself a favor and order some pancakes for the table to share!  Now, onto service. Everyone here has been amazingly nice and friendly. Danielle, who happened to be our server both times, was so great, I'd come back just to say hi to her, even if the food wasn't worth coming back for, which it most certainly is!  Can't wait for more of those Red Velvet Pancakes!  Food: 5 Ambience: 3 Service: 5 Value: 5",

The pancakes are amazing! They are soft, fluffy, sweet and yummy! We also ordered the senior breakfast and I was impressed at the amount of food that comes with this meal. My mothers doesn't eat much but she ate it all, even the pancakes. I will definately be coming back.",

It was a Sunday morning, the crowds weren't there yet, I think the line out the door started around 9 or so. My husband ordered a Chocolate Milk to start, well I think they only put the C in, it was the lightest chocolate milk I ever saw, our friend ordered one too and his looked the same, I think one drop of chocolate syrup was added to each cup. For breakfast he ordered the Breakfast Burrito with a short stack of S'Mores pancakes and I got a short stack of the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes with a side of Bacon. So my main gripe is about the pancakes, they weren't as light an fluffy as the SW location, they were also a tad over cooked and dry and my pancakes hardly had any bananas inside. My husband agreed that the pancakes weren' t as good this time. The Breakfast burrito was good and so was the bacon. My OJ tasted a little off as well so I just didn't drink it.  I would visit this location again but with all the other Babystacks around town now, I think I'll skip this one until it's absolutely necessary.",

It's also very affordable. I have yet to try the Nutella crepes, although they look decadent.   The place is a bit cramped and would like to see it bigger. The wait time can also tend to be quite long if you get there around 10-11.  I'm excited for the Centennial location to open; I'll be plastered at the door like a puppy to be the first customer..",

    "text": "It's too bad my new favorite breakfast place is in Nevada.  I'll have to visit this place every time I'm in Vegas.   It's worth waking up for.  It's worth driving to.  And it's worth the wait.    Everything I tasted was phenomenal.   The Red Velvet Pancake was out of this world!  The cream cheese syrup with buttery whipped cream really made this velvety pancake unforgettable.  I can have this for breakfast everyday!   I thought their Rocky Road pancake would be too sweet.  It was perfect! Impressive that almonds and marshmallows were inside the chocolate batter as well as on top.  As a peanut butter fan, I went bananas for my PBand??? pancake.  With peanut butter in and out of the pancake, I can taste how any topping would go well with this pancake.  Elvis would be proud!  He'd probably be here everyday too!    I had an omelet with ground beef, bacon, cilantro, and green onion.  It was like a marriage made in heaven.  Every flavor came out and I enjoyed every bite!    The Adobo Fried Rice was amazing too.  With marinated shredded chicken mixed with rice AND wrapped in four eggs, this unique omelet is definitely something to brag about.    Service was flawless, even with a long wait.  Their large size cups are ingenious for less frequent refills (for water, orange juice, soda).  But the coffee kept coming.      Can't wait to come back for more of their fresh pancake creations and other breakfast specialties.",

    "text": "The original Babycakes/stacks  Located on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch in the small strip mall next to Sierra Gold and a Hair Color Xperts. Plenty of car parks in the lot.  So your hungry or needing something sweet, Babystacks has got you covered from every angle. Traditional Breakfasts, Hawaiian breakfast, kids Meals and the Famous Pancakes are all on the menu.  I've been coming here since this place opened, and I'm never disappointed. The service is always prompt and the meals are always cooked and prepared in a timely fashion.  I Always recommended the signature dish of Red Velvet pancakes with white chocolate but in recent times I have been here, the Banana Foster pancakes have been outstanding!  Extremely kid friendly with high chairs and coloring to keep them occupied. Also adult friendly Flat screens with news or sports on tv to keep the grown ups occupied.  Weekends are a tricky one, due to the popularity of Babystacks the line up can get crazy so I recommend during the week.  Overall Food: 5-5 Drink: 3-5 Service: 4-5 Coming back: Yes",

Simply divine :-)   The place has a strong Hawaiian theme and feeling, from the decor, music and most important the food :-) I felt relaxed and laid back, very Hawaiian style. Our waitress even told us to buy the Groupon deal before we paid our bill. Who does that?? Seriously that was awesome and we saved a bunch of money! This is now my new breakfast spot :-) Next on my list is to try the banana cream pancakes :-)",

It was plenty of food, but I think of an omelet as eggs on the outside, filling in the middle.  What they gave me was more like a scramble with the eggs and ham and such all mixed together before cooking. Both the green peppers and the hashbrowns would have benefited from further cooking.  But overall the food tasted OK.  My service was good and food was prompt, but the coffee was mediocre.",

They don't mess around here. First off, pancakes. This is the place to go to try some sweet cakes of different varieties. My favorites are the Red Velvet and the holiday Chocolate Mint.  Skillets here are really good, but that could just be because the home potatoes are crunchy and well seasoned.  Now, crepes. Oh my, the Nutella crepe with strawberries here is to die for. The crepe is so light and airy, and they do not over due it on the Nutella, so it's not a heavy dish. You can get one, or many. You will want many. Service has always be top notch, and like I said before you are in and out in no time. Though there are other locations, this one stands out to me as the best based on the food quality and the service.",

I tried the loco moco breakfast which was scrambled eggs, white rice, a hamburger patty, and delicious brown gravy over the top. I also chose to replace the macaroni salad with hash browns. My wife ordered the biscuits and gravy with seasoned potatoes. Her plate arrived  with 3 massive biscuits and a white gravy that had bits of sausage throughout.   We topped off our order with a short stack of their red velvet pancakes. WOW-- these are great. However, a little too sweet for me to eat as an entire breakfast. My 3 year old son could not stop talking about these red pancakes, and even wanted them for dinner that same day.  Service is efficient, and the staff is friendly.

    "text": "For vacations, I love to browse yelp to look fro great places to eat in the city I visit.  So, for this past winter break I went to Vegas with friends and family.  Before we left Las Vegas, I wanted to try out Babycakes since it seemed pretty popular on yelp and one of their specialties was red velvet pancakes.  Mind you I LOVE red velvet cake/cupcakes/yogurt, so this was a must try.    My friends and I came at the right time and we didn't have to wait long.  This was probably around 8:45 Friday morning New Year's Eve.  The server was wonderful and friendly.  I of course ordered red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup and a cup of coffee.  It was soft and fluffy like a flattened red velvet cake.  I truly enjoyed the pancakes, and so did my boyfriend (we shared a full stack).  I would definitely have to stop by here again whenever I come back to Vegas. :)",

Kalua eggs benedict had the welcome addition of Kalua pork.  We also got a short stack of Red velvet pancakes.  These were rich, fluffy, and incredibly tasty but i'm so glad we only ordered a short stack to go with our other two meals.  I tend to like my brunches savory with some sweetness.  Any more pancake would have been overkill!  Will definitely be returning to try other dishes!",

We waited about 1/2 before being seated and another 15 minutes before we got our food.  I was surprised that with the many Hawaii related food items that the decor had no tie-in to Hawaii.  Our waitress was friendly and was quick to take our order.  She was so quick that we got our food before the couple that came in before us got there's.  (They had a different waiter)  I was disappointed that she offered us another beverage after our meal was done and we were about to leave.  My wife had the portuguese sausage and eggs with hash brown, and I got the Zippy's chili omelet with hash brown.  I got my food exactly what I ordered, but wished I got more chili.  My wife got the garlic rice instead of hash brown (which she didn't like and we felt it wasn't worth upgrading).  The mistake wasn't the waitress's fault, but with the kitchen because we didn't get charged extra for.  Overall, the food and service was okay, but factoring in the wait time, the mistake with my wife's food and the constant staring from the couple.  I would rather go to the breakfast place up the street on Flamingo.",

In the past we have had, the orange creamsicle, red velvet, maple bacon, nutella, banana cream pie, and carrot cake pancakes. They're all really delicious but SUUUPER sweet. My little family consisting of me, bf, and our 4yr old usually just order a short stack and share between the three of us. They have filipino-esque dishes like adobo fried rice along with hawaiian fusion options like Loco Moco.   My bf's favorite is their patty melt. It IS delicious but the last time we had it, I think they added an extra helping of grease.... which my bf didn't mind, LOL.   My favorite USED TO be the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, but recently, their hollandaise has had the consistency of pudding, the color of cheez whiz and the taste of.... idk, NOT hollandaise. Tis a shame because I always ordered it when we went. The last time I ordered their Kalua Pig grilled cheese and although it was delicious, it too, had an extra helping of grease. I couldn't finish the whole thing so I just handed it to the bf.    Other than the hollandaise, this place is pretty consistent and although I have a hard time picking out stuff to eat (partly bc I'm filipino and can cook a lot of what they offer), we can't help but to keep coming back for their pancakes. The 4yr. old is a definite fan! :D  *Also, they've opened up a second location in Spring Valley (still on Buffalo Dr.) It's still a ways from our place but close enough to have in the back of our minds when weekend brunch approaches!",

    "text": "Yum, yummy! My official new favorite breakfast place, the Baby Stacks on Smoke Ranch and Buffalo. We received a friendly greeting and were seated quickly. It was more like brunch time when we got there and it wasn't packed, but most of the tables were full.  I ordered the white chocolate macadamia pancakes with hash browns and bacon. My daughter had the kalua pig eggs benedict. Delicious all around and the bacon was thick sliced and cooked perfectly. Only negative was the two eggs on the benedict didn't match, one was cooked hard, the other was properly runny. It's a small, cozy restaurant. If you're looking for waiters in tuxedos, this isn't your spot. But if you want a homestyle breakfast served by friendly people with a tv up in the corner showing the game, try Baby Stacks.",

It was delicious combination of Eggs Benedict with biscuits and sausage and gravy and seasoned salt country potatoes!! I loved it all, nothing was left on my plate.  Basically this place is known for their variation on  homemade pancake batters.  If you come here you have a to at least have a short stack. We wanted to try them all. But instead choose these three.  Red Velvet short stack  5 stars Peanut Butter and Banana short stack 5 stars Hazel Nut short stack 4 stars  I will definitely come back here when I visit Vegas again.

I bet you were thinking I was going to say the wait huh? Because if you don't know, now you know, YOU WILL WAIT! However, I don't really mind the wait. If you come super early, or late you might get lucky and be seated right away.  I have not had that experience. My wait times have been 45 min on a Sunday, and 20 min on a Wednesday. Worth it? INDEED! Baby Stacks is known for 2 things in my opinion. 1. Their variety of pancake selections. Red Velvet, Rocky Road, Nutella, and my personal fav Lemon Ricotta. There is a hotcake to please everyone. 2. Their Hawaiian options like Loco Moco, spam, and garlic rice.  I would eat here way more if they opened up a Henderson location. Although I have never ventured outside of the breakfast, I wouldn't hesitate to do so. I am always satisfied with service, the food, and the ambiance in general. Solid, local business, with extraordinary  pancakes.",

I came here with four of my cousins and we all ordered from the \"breakfast favorites\" section of the menu that came with pancakes and we all ordered different kinds of pancakes and sampled from each other's plates.  I ordered Cora's corned beef hash and eggs and got the Cinnabun pancakes. The portion of rice in the order definitely was not enough, so I had to order an extra side of rice. Everything was cooked well though! My pancakes were delicious in flavor, but they were overwhelmingly dry for my taste. I also tried the red velvet, carrot cakes, banana cream pie, and chocolate chip pancakes, which were all also quite dry, but still tasty.   Overall, this place was cute and everything tasted good, but I came here expecting a lot more.",

I have heard a lot about BabyStacks and I am always reminded when I drive past it at least once a week.  I am a devoted patron to a different local breakfast dinner and usually go there for breakfast.  We wanted to try something different, so we headed over to try BabyStacks.  Our first mistake was getting there at 10:30am on a Sunday.  Oops and here comes a 45 minute wait.  That was self-inflicted pain, but we dealt with it.  Since we had a long wait, we had already checked out the menu and figured out what we wanted.  The menu has a lot of variety and definitely something for everybody.  This is always nice because I know we can never agree on food at my house.  They have your normal breakfast items like egg dishes, biscuits and gravy, and of course a multitude of pancake choices.  They also have a decent lunch menu with salads, sandwiches, and burgers.  On top of all of that, they have Hawaiian food on the menu.  Like I said, something for everyone.  I wasn't in the mood for breakfast by the time we were sat, so I went with Loco Moco.  It was good, but not great.  It totally hit the spot for my craving, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It came with a side of mac salad and it was really pretty bland, in my opinion. The first time I had Loco Moco was in Maui, so I am probably ruined since I compare everyone's version to the first one, and few compare.   So it was good, but not great.  My hubby got a breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage.  It was a huge burrito and he was only able to eat about 2/3 of it.  It also came with a side of regular pancakes.  The pancakes were ok, but again, nothing special.  Overall, his breakfast was ok and pretty average.  My mini me got the kid's grilled cheese and it was an awesome grilled cheese.  It was super gooey and overflowing with cheesy goodness.    Now I know what you are going to say, \"Why didn't you try the fancy, smancy pancakes?\" Well, I wasn't in the mood, so there.  Maybe this is why I am only giving it a 3 star rating and didn't get my socks blown off..  We do plan on checking it out again when we are craving pancakes and maybe it will be better next time.  For just regular breakfast food though, I think I will stick with my go-to place around the corner.  Based on this experience though, everything was ok.  The service was ok, the food was ok, and the prices were ok.",

I'll say we got lucky and only waited 25 mins on a Sunday at around Noon for a table of 4 (and the place probably only seats 30!).    I ordered the adobo fried rice which sounded good on the menu, but was just 'A-OK', in fact I didn't finish it all.  Disappointed.  It was missing something - more meat, more veggies, more taste overall.  I was tempted, but resisted dousing it with tabasco and shoyu although looking back now, maybe I should've.  Not impressed at all.   My daughter had the spam scramble and that is right up her alley - she was smiling ear to ear -- scrambled eggs with spam and rice with furikake!  She also ordered a side of seasoned potatoes which were yummy, not memorable yummy, but reorder worthy.    Friends that were with us ordered the red velvet pancakes which were pretty thick n heavy - if you like them that way, then you'll love these!  The taste was good and the cream cheese syrup was the best part!!  My girlfriend ordered the nutella crepes which we ooo'd and aaah'd about.  She said they were amazing!!  All in all, ok . . . I like the menu, so many choices and everything is just a little bit beyond the norm . . . lots of local favorites and service with a smile which is something I'll come back for.  I was disappointed with the adobo fried rice after all the rave reviews.  Next time, I'm trying the kalua pork eggs benedict - or portuguese sausage breakfast burrito!!",

    "text": "So a new foodie friend I made upon recently moving to Las Vegas texted me on Saturday to ask if I was interested in getting up at the crack of dawn on Sunday to go eat breakfast at 730 a half hour across town.  My initial thought was insanity and my second was whether or not anyone in town other than some compulsive gamblers needing a hangover meal would actually be there.  But then I heard three words that I didn't think was possible to string together in one phrase: Red...Velvet...pan-Cakes.   Having grown up in the south, folks take their red velvet cake pretty seriously, so I had to at least make the trip for a taste.  When I arrived, not only was my friend there 10 minutes early, but the entire place was already packed, so I knew I was walking into some serious eats.  As multiple orders of the infamous pancakes were ordered at our table, I began to think of that sketch where Bill Cosby talks about feeding his children chocolate cake for breakfast only to incur the wrath of his wife.   Perhaps these pancakes would have salvaged Bill from the doghouse.  If you ignore the sinfully red color of the pancakes, the chocolate chips are disguised as blueberries, the whipped cream as butter, and the sneakiest of all is the cream cheese syrup as the maple syrup....pure genius.  Assemble the components together and you get the perfect bite of warm red velvet cake with some additional bonus textures of the slightest crunch and chew from the edge of the pancake and the chocolate chips respectively.     This dish offers irrefutable proof one CAN have their cake and eat it too.",

Never had a benedict like that before and it was evenly portioned out between the shredded pork and cabbage. Yanno how some places give you more cabbage than meat. Yuck. But not Babycakes!!  The pancakes come with an amazing cream cheese syrup which completes the entree. I was in heaven. We split both entrees so it was a perfect amount! Got a little bit of dessert and regular food.  This is A MUST GO TO spot if you have a car. The drive is worth it. We didn't even have to wait because we went at the buttcrack of dawn. But as time went on the place got really packed, FAST. Plus the restaurant is pretty small so I can see there being a wait. Also keep in mind they close at 3PM.  AWWW YAH!",

I have to admit I had something totally different in mind when it came out. It is so filled with rice its not fried more like wet. Mush with the adobo and minuscule amount of chicken. I upgraded to the garlic rice which is just a waste. 3 stars because service was good. Thanks Ariana for taking care of us. Mostly likely sticking to normal breakfast for awhile.",

    "text": "Have you heard what everyone has been saying about the red velvet pancakes?  Well, it's True and more. These things are absolutely addictive.  Given the description, I really thought these pancakes had to be super sweet.  But they're not.  Even my sister, who isn't fond of sweets, loved these pancakes.    The staff was nice enough to create a potato dish for my sister with potatoes, cheese, avocado, salsa, and sour cream.  It was really good and nice of them to be so flexible.  I got the Adobo fried rice.  It was ok.  I have to admit, I am not a big fan of Filipino food.   Same thing with Hawaiian food. A little too bland for me.  But I love Chinese fried rice, so go figure.   All they had was Tabasco sauce, which I didn't think would work.  So I focused on the pancakes and took most of the Adobo fried rice home.  Heated up the next day and covered in sriracha, it's not too bad.  Most of the tables are high tops which can be a little uncomfortable.  And this place is tiny!  I hope they get a chance to expand.  I looking forward to coming back and trying more of their dishes!",

The service was spot on and the food was amazing.  I loved watching the plates come off the line.  I didn't know that it was Hawaiian owned and the Hawaiian plates on the menu were a pleasant surprise because I love all things Hawaiian.    Husband had the deliciously yummy banana cream pancakes, I had the kahlua pig eggs benedict.  I love eggs benedict and pride myself on knowing if a hollandaise sauce is freshly made or not.  This one was.  I could drink the stuff.  Anyway, overall this place had great service and awesome food so support this little local business.",

With all the options around it is not easy to come up with a different breakfast menu. Its different than most places. BUT does it make it better?? My main complaints:  1-OJ is NOOOT fresh or natural. WTF!!? You would expect a decent juice madeout of fresh oranges. Especially with the high ratings in Yelp. Nah.   2-Burned coffee. Yes, burned.   3-Slow service. I waited around 30min for a table and when seated, other 10-15min only for the first plates to be served.   4-My fiancee ordered the \"popeye crepe\" or something like that. The sauce (hollandaise?) was awful. Very greasy, salty, creamy and disgusting. I had the flavor in my mouth all day long.   The only decent thing was the walnut pancake.   Ill stay with Eggworks.",

    "text": "It was during our annual Thanksgiving trip to Vegas that we came across this cafe. My boyfriend and I needed to fuel up before we head out to the outlet for some serious shopping. We wanted pancakes so I did a quick Google search under \"Best brunch in Vegas\" and this came up as one of the 10. I have the tendency to look up menus to see if anything jumps out at me before I actually head there...the red velvet pancakes got me.  This cafe ended up being a little further than I expected off the strip...but wasn't hard to find.   To our surprise, we walked into a Filipino owned restaurant! It's as if the motherboard was calling my boyfriend home! :p As we got to our seat, I kept seeing patrons munching on a breakfast burrito and I couldn't find it on the menu at all! Whenever there's a breakfast burrito on the menu, I had to get it. So being too shy to ask, I ended up ordering Baby Chick Omelette with a side upgrade of the red velvet pancakes. My boyfriend didn't go far from his homeland and ordered the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice with a short stack of the Rocky Road pancakes.   The service was casual and quick. We got our food not too long after and as soon as it came, we dove in...after taking pictures of our food, OF COURSE! My Baby Chick Omelette was good and definitely loaded! The red velvet pancakes were good but I think Larchmont Bungalow in LA makes it better. I had a bite of the Adobo Fried Rice. It was good but a little dry for my taste. My boyfriend loved it though. His Rocky Road pancakes were to die for!!! It's ice cream in carbs form. Yum!!  I think this establishment is a great change from your strip buffets and overpriced food. I would definitely come here again.   As we went to the front to pay, I noticed behind their cashier was a blackboard of....their specials. And guess what was on their...the burrito. :( Lesson learned...ALWAYS CHECK OUT THE BLACKBOARD FOR SPECIALS!",

Me and my family went here for breakfast on 5/3/12 and after 6 months of researching for a great place to eat breakfast in Vegas i was set on Babaycakes after reading about thier red velvet pancakes.  Yum!  Im a fanatic about awesome breakfast and red velvet cake so to find a place that puts both of things together in to one dish made my day.  I got the long stack which came with six pancakes and a heaping scoop of whipped cream, butter and these chocolate chip coco nib things.  When i bit in to it the cakes were nice and warm and had just the perfect amount of sweetness with the cream cheese syrup.  Perfection.  The whipped cream and cocoa nib things were just the perfect amount of sweetness and was not overly sweet especially for me a person who doesnt have a sweet tooth.  It was heaven on a plate.  When i was done i felt very fool and satisfied with nothing left on my plate.  My lady had the breakfast burrito and it was really good espcially because i have a high standard for breakfast foods and its hard to mess it up.  My daughters shared the usual which was scrambled eggs, sausage and the regular pancakes.  My mother inlaw had portuguese sausage and french toast and she really liked it she said it reminded her of home and made her feel like she never left Maui lol.        All the food was exceptional for diner food and the prices were very reasonable.  Babycakes is a little restaurant outside the Las Vegas strip probably a 13 min. drive but well worth it.   The atmosphere and decor is like a typical diner. but more hip because it has a flat screen tv lol.  The service was exceptional and attentive and our waiter was very nice and patient and hooked it up with some crayons and paper for my girls.  Our food took about 15 mins which is not that long but like the drive its well worth the wait for it.  All the food came out hot and steaming although the presentation isnt anything to write home about, but once you take that first bite, devine!  Are you drooling yet???      I highly recommend this place for breakfast people especially for those that love red velvet cake.  When you pull up to this place it seems like its a hole in the wall but once you walk in its a whole different world.  I believe its one of the best breakfast spots in the area and even though its away from the strip it creates a suspence so dramatic that once you get there you wish it didnt end lol.  Enjoy!",

They only have two high chairs for the whole place and both would be in use.  IMO, a pancake place should be much more kid friendly than this is.

    "text": "Excellent breakfast spot, two of us ate and the food was fantastic.  Bannana Cream Pie pancakes (yes thats what they were),  were as fantastic as they sound,,,,it was bannannriffic.  Bacon and eggs were cooked perfectly and bacon was tasty.    Definately not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for.   This is definately a place worth frequenting if you enjoy breakfast out.",

A quick trip to the washroom ruined my breakfast- couldn't clear the stench of months old urine out of my nose- makes me wonder if the whole place is maintained this poorly.",

    "text": "The red velvet pancake is top notched. My niece loved her pancake with honey and chocolates. I forgot what it's called. The atmosphere is pleasing. We waited a little bit because it was really busy but the service is excellent. They serve garlic fried rice and adobo rice which is peculiar for a cafe (I'm guessing it's owned by Filipinos). Anyway, we'll come back again when we visit Vegas.",

    "text": "Yep..I heard about these amazing red velvet pancakes and had to drag the family to that side of town and try em. Of course the hubby had to try the grilled cheese and FF. They off the fries seasoned which is nice. His sandwich was pretty ordinary but he was happy. I had the special which was a breakfast burrito and that came with 2 of the best pancakes EVER!! They come with a small jar of cream cheese syrup and they are sprinkled with chocolate bits and a huge spoonful of whipped cream. 1st the burrito..it was perfect. I had ham in mine since my little guy loves it and we were sharing. We both tore into it. It had just the right amount of cheese,potato,ham, and eggs. We ate the whole thing. Now onto the most wonderful pancakes in the world... One word: YUMMY!!!!! Go get some NOW!!! These are amazing. Then do some serious cardio cuz god only knows how much sugar/calories there are in them. I also ate them both and did not share with the hubby or my baby! LOL Its a bit pricey..our bill was almost $24 bucks plus 5 buck tip. And it was on the other side of town. But I will drive here again  for THOSE pancakes. Oh..service was also fantastic!",
