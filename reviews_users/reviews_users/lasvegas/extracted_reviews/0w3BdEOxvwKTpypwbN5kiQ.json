My BF & I mostly go during happy hour (after 10pm) and our orders usually consist of : brisket, regular pork belly, ribeye and marinated pork belly. My top fave is not included during happy hr and u have to pay extra (Short ribs). I noticed a decline in their marinated pork belly. I noticed during the last several visits, most of the meat is fat. Brisket comes in different thickness/length with each order, but still tastes the same. (Pls keep it long & thick!....\"that's what she said....\")..When we first started coming here, we didnt know if what they gave us was brisket or tongue coz it ALWAYS looked so different every time they brought it out....I am a HUGE fan of their salad...so flavorful! i'm not a big salad girl and this is a definite must have every time i eat here..My bf loves their korean pancakes and i am a fan of the japchae. Overall, good banchan.  Our servers are usually the same 2 guys at night and they are both so friendly, attentive and hard workers!   This and Sura are my faves for Korean bbq...Honey Pig wasnt bad either!",

This night we chose the latter, sharing orders of spicy chicken and bulgogi (grilled marinated beef). The entrees were very good, but the 6 banchans (side dishes) were largely forgettable. I also tried for the first time a cup of mushroom tofu soup that I did not find to my liking.  Prices are moderate when combined with a KSHP discounted gift certificate.",

    "text": "I asked my son to pick a place & invite some of his friends to have dinner after his graduation. So when he said he wanted to eat at Tofu Hut, my first thought was, \"tofu? seriously?\" But don't let the name fool you, Tofu Hut is a Korean BBQ restaurant. They offer a regular menu or a cook-it-yourself, all-you-can-eat BBQ menu ($16.99 10am to 11pm & only $13.99 11pm to 4am). We chose the all-you-can-eat (of course).  Once we were seated at one the built-in grill tables, we ordered the sliced ribeye, short rib, brisket & pork belly (there are other meats like chicken, tripe & beef tongue). The meats were quickly brought out on platters, portioned enough to cover the entire grill. All of the meats were good & the sliced ribeye was super tender & really flavorful.  An assortment of side dishes were brought to our table. Rice, salad, kimchee, bean sprouts, pickled cucumber & a bunch of other stuff that I don't know the names of. Everything was tasty & the salad - shredded cabbage & lettuce, more like cole slaw, but with a sweet Korean spiced dressing that made this a favorite. The only dipping sauce we got for the meat was an olive oil with salt & pepper, but it was good.   The servers frequently asked if we needed anything, so I can't complain about the service. The restaurant is small enough that you can flag one of the servers down, or just look toward the counter and get their attention, if you need anything. It's all you can eat, so just ask for more.   Overall, the food is really good, prices are reasonable, restaurant is clean & our group of 10 was easily accommodated. This is a fun & interesting place to bring a group of hungry people. Although we did go back to our hotel smelling like kalbi, we'll surely be eating here on our future visits to Las Vegas.",

I would say it took them over 5 mins to even acknowledge our presence even though they did see us walk in.  I expected a \"Hello, or Welcome\" at the very least.  We passed on the AYCE tonight & went ala carte. We ordered short ribs & spicy chicken. Both orders were good, but nothing memorable or anything to rave about. I did love their banchan offerings! I liked the fish cake, japchae, spicy cucumber, and I don't recall the others but it was yummy!  I would go back.. but don't think I'll be a regular at this place.",

    "text": "Ah KBBQ - I almost didn't believe it when a friend described it as \"all you can eat meat buffett\" but it was True, and a dream come True!  There are a couple AYCE KBBQ here in town, most right up in Chinatown on Spring Mtn. For the most part there are same, with some slight variations. Tofu Hut is one my favorite though.  Tofu is set-up where they bring the meet to you. Its a small place so there really isn't much room for you to actually go up and get the food yourself. This of course puts you at the mercy of the wait staff. But usually their service is on point and there isn't much of a delay in getting what you want.  The prices are pretty cheap when compared to some of the other KBBQ joints. AYCE is $17, and they knock off $4 after 10pm. They have the full of assortment of Korean meats: brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, squid, beef tongue, and the like. I absolutely love the Kalbi, its delicious as is the steamed egg. (I have been calling it egg soup and no one has ever bothered to correct me).  Despite the name Tofu.. this place is anything but it. Overall a above average KBBQ spot and a great value.",

    "text": "Driving through China town on a Saturday night about 11. Wasn't really hungry but saw a Fukuburger truck and pulled into the parking lot but now I wanted rice. Come on I'm in China town, I am not gonna eat a burger with all the different restaurants around. Saw this place in the same parking lot, what is this all about, a bunch of tofu dishes? ok I'll try it.   They offered a pretty small selection maybe 8 Items AYCE for 13.99 (the way we went), tongue, squid, brisket, spicy chicken, 2 types of pork belly, and a few more.16.99 for short ribs or steam eggs. Include a variety of Korean sides and a kinda salty salad. I think drinks like soda and alcohol were extra because they never offered drinks and kept giving us water. The tongue was surprisingly ok, tasted like regular meat.  Spicy chicken and marinated pork belly were good but took too long to cook.  The very first item on the menu, forgot what it was sliced something, but not a good choice for grilling it was in tiny chunks like ground beef but not as packed in and kept falling into the grill openings. If u do get this cook it as one whole piece like a burger and let it burn a bit, easier to flip that way.   Customer service was ok once we got going. Two other groups were there when got there, the girl told us take our seats, waited almost 15 mins before anything went on. They got our ingredients, etc quickly.   In comparison to the other self cooking Korean places that I've been to, two other places, it is my #3 choice. Because its cheaper but way lesser selections and have no idea about the drinks.",

A group of us came in to grab a bite after work. We did not feel like doing all you can eat, so we ordered off the menu.  Japchae- glass noodles with beef and vegetables used too much soy sauce. Normally they are lightly colored by the dark sauce and has a complimentary taste of sesame oil, but this one was predominately soy sauce. I didn't eat more than a few bites of it.  Mixed beef and seafood soon dubu had plenty of seafood and beef pieces. The abundance of soft tofu made the dish enjoyable, but it lacked flavor. Same could be said about the mushroom pot.  Bulgogi- thinly sliced beef marinated in soy sauce and sugar sauce with vegetables. This dish was on the sweet side. Combined with the kimchi, it balanced out, but too much on it's own.  Kalbi- soy sauce based marinated beef short ribs. These are the best! It was so good, that we ordered another plate. The flavor was balanced and the meat was so tender. I could pull the meat right off the bone without much resistance. It definitely was the saving grace of the meal.",

There is usually no wait if you are not getting the all you can eat bbq so if that's you check the right part of restaurant first there will prob be tables for you to start grubbing. I got the dumpling which comes with dumplings and beef. All tofu soup is $8 something. It wasn't the best I've had but I was impressed by the amount of beef and dumpling in it. Usually you get super shisted but they don't hold out. The ban chan is not bad either. Also the combo with tofu soup and meat is a good value. I tried the combo short ribs and it was good but you can tell it wasn't a great piece of meat. Service was fast and food was hot though and I am a very happy wannabe Korean despite the continuous play of ghetto Korean music videos with skinny Korean chicks' shaking their little butts and words like swag sporadicly pop up in mist of all the bootie shaking and tofu soup. You may think that I'm going off on a bit of a tangent but all these little elements adds to the dining experience. So yeah eat at your own discretion.",

    "text": "After visiting Sura so many times, we decided to give Tofu Hut a shot after a coworkers recommendation. In short, tofu is just the tip of the iceberg. This review is for the AYCE experience.  AYCE is served differently here than most buffet style restaurants. Yes, it's all you can eat, however you place up to four orders of meat and they bring it out to you, which are actually perfectly portioned so you don't get charged for wasting items.  Food wise, the food is fantastic. They bring you out six small appetizers to snack on while your meat arrived. We decided on the sliced ribeye, short ribs, beef tongue, brisket, and pork belly. All we satisfying. One of the things we wished we had was some kind of sauce (be it soy, tempura, teriyaki, anything) to dip our meat in. Granted, the natural flavors of the meats are great, however some of the meats other than the pre-marinated ones are lacking in seasoning.   The downside, the service is awful. We only seen our waitress twice, and that was to drop off our water, and present the check. We were never asked for any soft drinks, beer, etc, and we had to order from another server when we wanted refills on our drinks, and to order more meat. We just sat there wanting to eat more, and it was a good fifteen minutes before we grabbed the attention of a friendly male waiter. I know most traditional inspired Asian restaurants aren't known for their service, however if I'm giving you my money, I want to at least be acknowledged from time to time!  Decent experience, food was great, kind of overshadowed by lacking service. Oh well. Still full!",

Only half the restaurant is dedicated to BBQ and the other half regular menu service. So with that in mind, on busy nights, there can be quite a wait, especially if you have a larger party.  Now on to the good stuff. Everything here is awesome! I mean where can you go wrong with AYCE BBQ? There are plenty of sides and the staff is quite attentive. Personally I love to sit there, grill my meat and just mix it right in the salad bowl and go to town. Man do I miss this place. Because when it comes to Korean BBQ, fancy doesn't always mean good.

Everything was really tasty and our stomachs were happy! Too bad you're not able to take the leftovers home. Felt like such a waste of food. Not my first time here and won't be my last.",

    "text": "I came here with my fiance and another couple.  We wanted to eat at Mr. Tofu, but they are closed on Sundays.  My fiance used to come to Tofu Hut a lot before discovering Mr. Tofu.  Since I have limited experience with Korean restaurants, I will be comparing Tofu Hut with Mr. Tofu, which is directly across the street.  The parking in both places could be better.  Tofu Hut has more seating and was busier.  Some tables at Tofu Hut had grills built into the tables.  As you may know, each meal comes with some complimentary sides.  The sides at Tofu Hut are better.  I like the fish cakes.  Also, they gave us slices of bread made from rice that was pretty good.  I always order the same thing, bibimbap dolcet.  They are equally good at both places.  Tofu Hut gives you a large bottle of spicy bean paste.  Mr. Tofu provides a small portion.  The rice never got crunchy, which is my favorite part.  I guess the hot pot cooled down too much before they could add the ingredients.  Perhaps an oversight because they were so busy.  A careless mistake in my opinion.  That is the best part of the dish.  At Tofu Hut, bibimbap dolcet also comes with spicy tofu soup made with spicy bean paste.  That was the best part.  Really good and hot.  They add one raw egg.  I love dipping the fish cake in the spicy soup.  I think the price is similar.  My fiance got her usual, which is tofu soup.  It was not very good.  Our friends ordered galbi, bulgogi, and some sort of spicy chicken dish.  The galbi was very good.  The bulgogi was disappointing.  The other chicken dish was really good.  Overall, I liked Tofu Hut better, but I doubt my fiance will agree, so you will probably see me back at Mr. Tofu.  Both are good.",

We just went last night for some topu soup. They had a little poster on the wall advertising free karaoke from 11p to 4a above a little karaoke system and monitor.   I ordered the sashimi bibimbap ($10) from the poster next to.   I like ordering things off the wall apparently. I think I got that from Ichiza.   The server dropped all of the banchan, nothing special, but there was seven or eight different shallow banchan.   My entree came with a topu soup, the Korean version of miso. The server said my sashimi was \"a white fish, yellowtail.\" They drop this huge bowl of salad greens, daikon, and sashimi. You're supposed to dump some rice in and this spicy, sweet, vinegary sauce and mix it all up. I've never had bibimbap because I don't eat meat too often. It was pretty good. Only the sashimi was still frozen. Meh.   It was enough to fill me up PLUS take leftovers home. Leftovers is my best friend.   When you're ready for the bill, you have to body check the waitress to get some attention. But aren't all Korean/ Chinese/ Viet restaurants like that? No? Dust? Anyone? I don't know.   I like Tofu Hut. Their prices aren't great, but the portions are huge. And they have soju. And soju puts me to bed with visions of sugar plums ...   * off the strip, non-casino",

The flavor of the meats were also good n there was hardly any fat on the brisket everytime. Now the part that really sucks...the lag on meat big time. We had to ask repeatedly and when I say repeatedly I mean at least 5 times before they brought out another plate of meat. One guy even pretended he couldn't hear me when he was walking past me as I was trying to ask for meat. For me if your not giving me my order then you're trying to rip me off. So if you like the sides at kbbq, then go but if you like a lot of meat skip this place because they're fuckin shiesty!!",

After reading the review from channel 13 dirty dining reports, we were hesitant to go back there. But nonetheless, they got their A grade back, which means everything should be up to health code. Owning my own restaurant, keeping up to healthcode is sooo important. We reserved a table and the same guy and girl who works there is always kind to us. The meat is good and can't complain too much about the banchan cause we only go there to eat the meat & salad. Okay for $13.99, you really cant beat the price, yes their selection is limited BUT their selection contains main meats that we usually only get. Come to happy hour with your friends to share a few laughs, drink, & eat!!! well worth it!",

Waitress showed up at the beginning and end of the meal to drop of the bill. Kids drop their utensil? Get up and ask for another. Need a napkin or chop-sticks? Get up and ask for it.

Hmm maybe I'll fork over the extra couple of bucks to go somewhere else.   There was a ~10 min. wait, as usual (actually, \"as usual\" means a 30+ minute wait, so I guess it was a short wait). By the time we got to the table the small plates, rice, salad were already there. A+ for fast service! However the rice was already a little cold so it was a nice attempt, but a fail.   Order the marinated sliced ribeye, order the marinated sliced ribeye! It was the best out of the meats we ordered. Soft and juicy! The brisket, tripe, beef tongue were a little dry.  The small plates were good- you can get extra orders of it all.  The steamed egg was dry and not the soft fluffiness you expect.",

    "text": "Yeah, I would say \"Hut\" is a good word to describe this place. It is kind of small for being a Korean Barbeque joint.   Here's the deal. When you first come in, the left half of the restaurant is designated for AYCE while the right half is for a la carte. Make sure to sign in so you can have your place in line. Don't forget to include the time you signed in along with the number in your party.  I would say you got room for about 48 people total in the whole restaurant. So on really busy days, you just might be waiting a while to sit down.  The day I went, we had total of 16 for our party. Surprisingly, we were seated after waiting about 30 minutes. Not bad for a party of our size.  So here's the low down if AYCE is your option. - You need a minimum of two people to pick this option so if you are going solo, then a la carte is your only option. - $16.99 per person any time. $13.99 from 10 pm to 2 am. - No to go or take home. (Duh!) - Don't be afraid to ask for refills on any of your sides because there is no extra charge. - You must eat all the meat that you order or you will be charged extra.  As for the meats, I was pleasantly surprised, especially the marinated items like brisket, ribeye, and pork. The sides were good as well from the kimchi all the way to the salad, which is very solid. The salad itself I can eat all day.  Service was fast and furious, which would of made Paul Walker proud (may he Rest In Peace) for our party was eating like there was no tomorrow. I was impressed because not only did they keep up with our demands, but all our waters were constantly refilled.   So TH, I will definitely mention you if anybody asks about ACYE Korean Barbeque.

There was no other reason for us to be here other than we were craving Korean BBQ. I can eat pretty much every hour since I'm always hungry. There were some empty tables at 1am which is why it didn't make sense to me to have to wait for a table. There were 2 guys before us waiting for a table.  We got our ban chan which were pretty tasty. But their meat selections were pretty limited. We got the marinated rib eye, pork belly and brisket. There's an AYCE Korean BBQ place that has rib eye not too far away from TH and I like theirs better. So, I was a bit disappointed with TH's rib eye...it wasn't tasty for being marinated and it's not that tender. You can't go wrong with brisket since it's super quick to cook and it's good stuff. Pork belly - we kept ordering this. They have a limit of 4 orders and at least 2 people need to do AYCE. You mean, if I sleep eat they won't serve me anything? Well, booooo!!!",

Their decor, Service, and meat is actually improving. Although they offer a late night special on AYCE the best meat isn't offered so go for the $16.99 option.  My one gripe is the service is really lacking. They don't come around much, they hardly refill drinks, they hardly bring around napkins, they don't seem to like when you request a banchan refill. That last part is most annoying. I admit it is a hit or miss. It really just depends on the time and who is working.  I first noticed this annoyance when dining at Sura. They are buffet style yet their servers come come around so much! They refill and check on you more than Tofu Hut and that is just disappointing for Tofu Hut.",

We honestly shy away from the chicken thighs because it takes too long to cook & tends to be somewhat dry. The salad that comes with the meal is incredible and so are all of the sides!  The price after 10pm decreases to only 13.99$ for AYCE, which is a great price for how much you get. The only downside is they close at 3AM with a last call at 2, and there can also be a wait on busy days since seating with grills are limited. But nonetheless, extremely recommended as our favorite Korean BBQ place in Vegas!",

    "text": "No wonder my buddy Jerry Ngo goes here seemingly every night!  This place offers a great korean bbq experience at a fraction of the price that other similar places offer.  At $16.99 all day, and a few dollars cheaper after 10PM, why even bother anywhere else?! =P  The food was great and offered many selections of meat.   Off the top of my head:  Chicken, pork belly, tripe, marinated short rib,  beef tongue, brisket, and even squid.  There were a few more and I'll remember to take a picture of the selections next time.   If you paid the regular price you also can order their steamed egg dish.  It came out piping hot, with green onions mixed in with the fluffy eggs.  Very tasty, but let me warn you again, it's comes out really hot!  Prior to the arrival of all the meat, we were served many side dishes which included rice, seaweed, a chopchae noodle dish, something with chopped fish in it, and a few other things.  The standout side dish is their salad.  Im not sure what was in it, but it was very very good,  Come early!  This place is not as big as other places and fills up fast!  The wait can be long.    If the storeowners read this, I would definitely recommend considering changing their other half of the room (the ala carte section)  to add in more tables with grills.   That half of the room was pretty empty save for maybe one person, while there was a line building up in the front door.  I should have checked out this place sooner, definitely coming again.",

    "text": "I really hate to do this, because this once was my \"Go-to\" spot for KBBQ.. it has the best late night price in Vegas for $13.99, and even there regular all day price for $16.99.. I mean really you cannot beat that price!!   But why 1 star?! Why am I updating my raving review about them?! Why am I probably never going to return to my once favorite KBBQ spot?! why you ask.. lemme tell you, it's because a little critter called a COCKROACH crawled its way across our chair we were seated at, and made it's way up against the glass window.. while we were still eating!!  Had to get the attention of the servers that we had an unwelcome guest trying to join us.. and he quickly grabbed two menus to scoop up the critter to have it removed, and tossed it outside.. but I'm sorry my friend, where there is one seen.. there are always more to be found. There is NEVER just ONE COCKROACH.. and this one that was trying to join us was not full grown.. so somewhere are its mommy and daddy COCKROACH and siblings roaming around.   The server apologized.. and we could see the rest of the servers quietly talking about it among themselves at the register. To EXTREME disappointment, no management came to approach us to apologize for the incident that totally ruined our meal and appetite.. I was even about to order another round of brisket, but after that.. I could barely swallow what I was already chewing..   My bf's dad, who works in hand with the health department and the USDA, was NOT HAPPY.. he asked to speak to the manager after they gave us the check.. which nothing was compensated for the horrific experience, and the server he was speaking to was playing dumb like she didn't understand what he was asking.. so he calmly said, \"Well, when you do speak to your manager, please let him know everything was really good. The food all tasted great and was good up until the COCKROACH.\"   To make this story even better.. is that this was my first time having dinner with my boyfriend's parents, it was their first time eating here at Tofu Hut, and it was their first time having KBBQ grill style, oh and it was me that recommended the place :/ I was SOOOOOO embarrassed because I had explained the concept of the restaurant and raved about how good it was, and the parents were even saying on the car ride there that they were excited to have AYCE meats..   My boyfriend's dad was really upset and super disappointed that no type of management came out to apologize and talk to us, there was no sense of urgency, sincerity in the apology, or showing that there would be some kind of action taken.   I originally gave this place 4 stars because I really did love eating here.. DID is key word. I had taken off 1 star for the decor being run down and old and menus being sticky, and the bathroom being nasty.. but after this experience yesterday on 10/07/15... that's something you never forget, and it really does make you sick to see COCKROACH running around while you're eating. And something needs to be done. And to physically see a cockroach run around with my own eyes, while I'm eating in a restaurant is something I would never wish on anyone to experience. I literally almost threw up right there.   So to end this review.. I'm sadden.. and disgusted to say that I will never be returning to Tofu Hut, no matter how good the meat is. It honestly saddens me to give this review and rating, but it's one thing to bitch and complain about terrible tasting food, or shitty service while dining.. but to be accompanied by a COCKROACH while eating raw meat that is being brought out to you is one a whole other kinda level. Oh, and my boyfriend's dad today did make a call to the Health Department.",

My family and I ate here last night and we had a good dining experience. Normally their kim chee is lovely, but last night is was way too spicy and my water was not getting filled up fast enough. All of the other side dishes were marvelous, though. Last night, my favorite was the Jab Che. Everyone at my table ordered the Kalbi plates. Last night my Kalbi was sooo tender! I finished everything! Oh, we also ordered the Barbeque salad, and I felt that too was also a tad but spicier than usual. Other than the spice, everything tasted great, like it always does.  Tofu Hut is a great spot for having some great food! Definitely choose to sit at a regular table if you want to avoid waiting.",

But it's good enough to get me to come back again for the late night price. I do however find the service to be spotty and sometimes a bit unfriendly.",

They have several different varieties featuring pork, beef, seafood or even vegetarian friendly mushroom tofu soup. I usually order the mix... yup, has everything :)  I'm afraid, I can't help you much on the rest of menu as I can't pull myself away from their tofu soup!!!  Service is... Korean style. They will bring your drink ans food but if you need something else, i.e. refill or more napkims you just wave or call. It is customary and they won't think you're being rude. If you wait for them to check on your table, you may wait a while.",

When your order the squid you get the whole squid which is cool, The tripe also had beef intestines which were really good they cleaned the intestines pretty well because you don't get any of that strong flavor that you would normally get if someone didn't clean it out well. The beef tongue was very tender as for the pork belly, which i like a lot because it had a nice kick to it. Yum. I thought the side were good as well. You could as them for more without being charged extra.   Service was ok. But that is only because it was busy. i'm pretty sure if they weren't busy they service would have been a little bit better. But that's for any place.  What i really love about this place is the quality of everything was really good for the price that the offered. Well worth it!",

When I walked in I stood in the door way/waiting area for like 5 minutes as I waited and stared at each employee of this place idk maybe because I wasn't Korean I wasn't getting the best service at the door. Finally we got seated, I felt rushed by my waitress and trust me after she dropped off our dishes that was the last time I saw her. She never came back to refill our waters or anything. Flagging someone down just to pay the bill was also an issue no one paid attention to us.   Kim Chi Beef: 3/5  I liked their Kim Chi beef but it doesn't compare to other places I've tried. A bit mediocre it was very watery and salty. I had huge chunks of Kim Chi which I liked but I had no idea where he \"beef\" was. I'm guessing it had to be some sort of ground beef. The tofu was cooked perfect though not too soft not to hard  Seafood Beef: 2/5  My boyfriend got this dish because he loves sea food in this Tofu, but omg super salty it tasted to bland not even tasty. There was barely any sea food in his the only thing I could recall were scallops and they tasted like imitation scallops. The tofu was cooked perfect though not too soft not to hard  Side dishes: 2/5 I actually really liked their assortment of side dishes but our waitress was never around to refill them. I was pretty disappointed.",

First off, if you are going to call your restaurant \"Tofu Hut,\" understand that you need to have more than one dish that is vegetarian.  Period.  You might as well change it to \"Only Meat Hut.\"  The rest of the place is scary down to the scary karaoke on the flatscreen.  Try to avoid the bathrooms, they wreak of a combination of vomit and heavy duty cleaning solutions.    The one frazzled woman working the lunch shift was nice enough although very confused when we asked where the tofu was when looking at the menu.  The only vegetarian dish is a cold buckwheat noodle dish with chopped lettuce on top.  Despite the claim that it is vegetarian, there is a totally suspect looking hard-boiled egg tossed on top.    The one thing that was actually enjoyable was the array of kimchi.  It was truly impressive ranging from the standard pickled Napa cabbage to seaweed to tofu varieties.  I guess I'll end this review on that positive note.  Meh.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Tofu Hut for years and it's definitely had it's ups and downs but seemingly the quality is going up. My favorite part is always the salad. I won't lie, depending on which staff was working would depict the quality of the banchan and salad. Recently though the quality is good day and night and no matter which members are working.  Pros: Pretty cheap prices for AYCE. Meat thickness is always consistent and marinated beautifully if they're meant to be marinated. Meat always is fresh and delicious. Sign-in list for AYCE during busy times has helped manage the crowds much easier during dinner and late hours opposed to its early years. They offer a menu of non-AYCE meals that are reasonably priced and taste very good for when you don't feel like cooking your own food. The AC is usually running at a decent rate depending on the crowds - there was only one time in the past few years where I was too hot to eat. Unlimited everything so it's good for big groups and hungry people! The staff is often very nice but sometimes the women don't appear friendly.   Cons: Only two restrooms, one male and female, so there will be a wait time sometimes if suddenly multiple people need to use the restroom. The atmosphere is often times going to be loud due to overhead music, people chattering, and the sizzling of the grills. The waiting area is small so sometimes you'll be lining up down the hall or near the door waiting for your AYCE table. The grills may be set too hot sometimes, but if that happens just flag down a waiter and ask them to turn it down and then wait a minute before cooking again (like you would at home).  Overall it's always been a great experience for me at Tofu Hut and I eat here like 15 times a year without regret. I only give 4 stars because I'm counting all my experiences from their opening to today and it's not always been perfect each time.",

They crack an egg into the little cauldron and you stir it up and enjoy.  It is also served with a bowl of rice.  The portion is good for 1 1/2 meals. All for around $8.  Every time, I request it spicy, and every time, it is not.    They are open late so it is a good joint for late night comfort soup.",

The BBQ sausage is just a hotdog and a sausage with your typical BBQ sauce on it.   With only two servers and a packed house, they maintained to keep the plates coming along serving other tables. As your grill gets too char'ed up, ask for a grill change to keep the meat tasting delicious!   I'll definitely be back here since it's the most bang for your buck!",

Ordering brisket is a must for me since I'm not a fan of their other meats (bulgogi can be inconsistent and pork belly is too fatty). I love their ban chan (the Korean pancakes are sooo good !). Of course , their house salad is a plus. It's amazing. My favorite salad of all time :D  - There is usually a wait during the evenings , especially when time gets closer to late night special. Seating is limited.  - The service can be a hit or miss , it usually starts off good with the orders + water refills then it dies down.  - They'll do split checks , no problem. No troubles there so far. The bill also adds tax and gratuity in it.  - Always a go-to to fill the Korean BBQ cravings in this area.",

Yelped the closest place and it was Tofu Hut, took an uber, put our name down for a  wait, ONLY to realize that the line/wait is only for the people who want to partake in the kbbq option. Woops, I'll remember that for next time.  After about 10 min and realizing that the other half of the restaurant which was just meant for non-kbbqers, we got seated immediately (as this side was pretty much empty).  Ordered mushroom soondubus for the both of us, which surprisingly were only $5-7 (in the bay, these dishes range from $12-16) and we were served with QUALITY ass soon dubu. I was blown away with how much product was served from the ban chan to the mushrooms to the tofu (i swear i've never received a soon dubu where the soon was literally falling off the brim of the pot). SOO much for such a little price, I was shook.   Needless to say, this meal cured us and we felt way better after getting this in our systems. Will come again whenever we're in the area, you can make that a promise.",

Every time I flagged down a waiter or waitress, they quickly came and took my order. None of my orders were forgotten about and my requests were quickly fulfilled. They even offered my party a pitcher of water to leave at the side of the table so that we can refill our waters ourselves and not have to wait. I am adding a star for the improvement of service. I'm guessing it has to do with increased competition.  I still am bothered however by the way they seemingly cheat their customers by not telling them the parties over four people are charged automatic 15% gratuity. There still a line for gratuity when you pay for your meal. It's not until you ask them if gratuity is included that they will admit it. I don't know if it is a method to avoid paying tips to their servers since I believe it's usually based off of what is written on the gratuity line but I think it's sketchy nonetheless.",

The AYCE line was long, as per usual. I walked to the front to wave someone down because I was there for the regular menu. Everyone ignored me, probably thinking I was just an impatient AYCE customer.   I ordered my usual, spicy shredded beef soup. I could hardly wait, anticipating the strong flavors and spices that made me grow to love this dish. Unfortunately my mouth tasted a watery, and strange tasting soup. Something was different....cabbage?! Tons and tons of cabbage. No no no. I was really disappointed to say the least, just ask my boyfriend lol. He ended up getting bulgogi which was very dry and overcooked. Where did the sauce go?   I don't know what changed. The management? The cooks? Either way, I didn't enjoy it.",

The AYCE KBBQ prices for both lunch and dinner beat the rest. I mean $13.99 between 10:00pm to closing and then $16.99 any other time. You can't compete with that.   You. Just. Can't.  Their appetizers will prepare your mouth for the glorious meat you'll eat. My favorite is the Korean pancake and tofu. Their house salad is also amazing. I have contemplated endless times to see if I could do a pick-up order on just their salad alone.  As for their meats, my favorite would be the good o'fashion pork belly. The brisket follows and then maybe the marinated pork belly. If you're extremely hungry, go ahead and order their steamed egg. It's a perfect combo with the rice.  The only reason why this place is 1 star away from a perfect 5 is their size. I really wish it was bigger! Half of the restaurant is divided so it can be a long gruesome wait if you come at the wrong time.",

I came with a group of friends extremely hungry, yet able to wait for about 45 minutes without dying. And yet they had us waiting around OUTSIDE for an HOUR AND 45 MINUTES. And heres the kicker - when we checked up on them to ask what the hell was going on (line hadnt moved an inch since we got there), they rudely snapped at us \"Uh-- no table for you. We close now.\" And told everyone that waited in line that entire time to haul their asses back home with an empty stomach! Unbelievable.   This doesnt even cover the fact that they have an ENTIRE section in the back that they sequester away from all of the \"all-you-can-eat\" diners(which subsequently makes their restaurant have a much lower capacity) either because they have no restaurant management skills or because they are lazy. I assume its a combination of the two.   Please update the way you manage your table service. Otherwise, you have lost at least two loyal customers.",

They no longer have the AYCE special that is offered after 10:30pm and that it is a single rate of $17.99 per adult. For the menu, the only real addition is the BBQ Sauce Sausage. It is just a plain hotdog with bbq drizzled on it lol. Very odd and definitely does not justify that price increase. Wait times still seem to be very long. Why is it that only half of the restaurant is for KBBQ? Does anybody actually eat at the other side? I would imagine profits would be much more substantial if the entire place was converted to KBBQ and which would definitely cut down on the wait times. To finish up, for that new price there are much better options such as Hwaro, BiWon, or Doh. I would only return to Tofu Hut now as a last resort.",

Won't be giving this business another nickel.",

Not much for flavor in those 2 cuts.  Come with the usual assortment of sides, rice and a salad this is good but went mostly untouched as we chowed on the meat instead.  Service was fine, they don't really come up to you much asking if you need something, you'll need to flag them down, but there were enough on staff that it wasn't a problem.",

One thing I appreciate from servers is when they refill my water constantly when it's low. They did a really great job with that and checking up on me. Honestly, I ordered wayyy to much food than I could handle & asked how much it was per entree if I didn't finish my food. It's about $7 & the sever was kind of enough to tell me not to worry about it. Service was awesome and food was awesome! Thanks tofu hut for the great kbbq experience!",

We got here around 11pm on Thursday night and there was a 45-60 minute wait, since there are only a few tables available for bbq.  We saw some other people eating off the menu, so we decided to do that instead.  We opted for one of the stews and it was terrible.  Everything in it tasted like it was just quickly thrown together- from the soup base to the dumplings. The soup base tasted like one of those premade tofu soup packages that you get from Asian grocery stores mixed with some frozen dumplings that you also get from the grocery stores.  DId not like it AT ALL.  The service wasn't bad... they were pretty attentive.  If I'm ever back here, I'll try the bbq instead.",

The reason why I'm giving two stars is because when my bf and I were eating, this lady was cleaning a table across from us. I kid you not, she took a napkin from that dirty table, dipped it into someone's water cup that was already on the table as well, and wiped the frame of the grill with it. I know it's just the frame, but that's still so unsanitary! I didn't even see her clean the grill itself, our grill was kinda oily and had burnt bits around the edges. I wouldn't come back again just because there are so many other Korean bbq places in vegas.",

    "text": "Because my mom is an amazing cook and restauranteur, her food has become the very high benchmark to which I compare all Korean restaurants. That being said, there are no restaurants in this valley that surpass or even meet that level. However, when I do want Korean food and my mom isn't here, Tofu Hut is very comforting.  What brings me here is their Soon Dubu Jjigae (soft tofu soup). The type of tofu that is used in this particular soup is difficult to purchase non-commercially, so soups made at home will not be able to mimic this silky offering. The flavors are so delicious and indescribable. You can also choose the type of soup you want like Kimchee or Seafood, changing the overall flavor of the dish. I always go with Pork because I think its flavor really transforms the broth to something amazing. The spice level can also be chosen (don't let the red color scare you, it's a non-spicy spice they use). The best part? It's around $10 for the meal! It comes with a bowl of rice and unlimited Pan Chan (side dishes).  When I dine with certain people, I will also do the AYCE BBQ. It's not my favorite thing, but for $17, it's pretty awesome! My favorite cuts of meat to order are Beef Tongue, Brisket, and Marinated (Spicy) Pork. They give you the traditional sesame oil/salt mixture to dip your unseasoned meat in and a refreshing salad of cabbage and romaine lettuce. It's a modern twist on the traditional Korean dining method of wrapping the meat and rice in lettuce leaves called Sang Chu Ssam. I thought it was weird at first, but I've really grown to like it! Bonus: Soon Dubu Jjigae is only $5 with your AYCE meal! Score!!  Expect a wait during busy times for AYCE since it's only available on one side of the restaurant. Fortunately, the longest I've waited was about 15-20 minutes.",

    "text": "In my opinion, the food here isn't that good, sometimes even bland. But to me, this isn't that place where you come here expecting great food and service. You come here when you just finished partying and it's 12:47 at night, you come here when your friend is feeling bummed out and you want to treat him, or just to catch up with a group of friends you haven't seen in awhile. It's that type of place.   They just recently remodeled to some more modern furniture so that's pretty nice to see. The place is located on spring mountain right off the i-15 it can be really easy to miss so just keep your eye out.   If you come here on during the day you should have no problem finding a table. But coming in at night is a different story. Expect a min. of a 40 minute wait. And no you can't make reservations haha.  The service here can be very different at times. But lately they have been on top of it. Sometimes you have to raise your hand to be get some attention. Don't expect top notch service.  Waiting for food isn't a problem, when you order they usually get it out within a few minutes. Top priorities should be bulgogi, pork belly, and brisket. They don't have it on their menu but you can ask for rice! For the taste, nothing is really note worthy all just average tasting food.  PRO TIP! Call in to see how long their wait is, if it's too long for you just go to another place to eat. Instead of being surprise when you get there and saying what a waste of gas it was too come.  If I could change something about this place I wish they would just expand their place already! The waits are too dam long.",

I think I would always attempt to write one but kanack attack (food coma) hits me & then I KO, sadly forgetting to submit a review. Therefore, here I go.. finally!  Pros: AYCE, $16.99/person (CHEAP!), good customer service, FOOD.  Cons: \"Hut\" in Tofu Hut is the absolute TRUTH; very small restaurant. Wait times could be very, very icky.   The meats are absolutely delicious. My favorites would have to Marinated Ribeye, Short Ribs (Kalbi) & Marinated Spicy Pork Belly. Banchans (sides) were yummy too and that Steamed Egg doe, mmmmm. Love the fish cake, bean sprouts & jap chae noodles. I always skip the big bowl of salad though; I am not a fan of that. I guess it's the carnivore in me.  I've gone there different times in the day and the most quiet time surprisingly was lunch time on a Sunday. Came around 1130 AM & it wasn't packed at all. I guess wait times are a hit or miss but it's worth the wait and they're open till after midnight so pick your time accordingly. Also, the servers are just great. After dining at Woonam Jung Lee's Korean BBQ & receiving the absolute WORST customer service (Hence, my review on them, grr), Tofu Hut surpasses them by a mile or two or maybe even more!   In all honesty though, after dining here 324987598 times, I have never gotten any bad service, eaten anything unappetizing & waited too long to dine. So yes Yelp, you are definitely correct: \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" :)",

    "text": "I believe I have found my new Korean BBQ place in Tofu Hut. The simplicity of this place makes this an enjoyable place for me and whoever I come to this place with.  The dinner price is about $17 bucks and includes all the items on the all you can eat menu and about $14 after 10 P.M. The extra items you get for the extra three dollars are the short ribs and the steamed eggs. The short ribs I would say is well worth it because that is my favorite meat on the menu personally. The egg is good as well, but it's not as special as the short ribs. I do really enjoy the bulgogi (marinated sliced ribeye), the brisket, and the short rib the most, but the pork belly and chicken thigh are good as well. The meats have been fresh every time I have visited and so I haven't had any problems there. The rest of the food are served with various side dishes and you can ask for that, as well as salad and rice when you run out of those things.   The service is adequate, but sometimes it feels like they see your hand, but they just ignore you just cause. They do bring you your meat and whatever else you ask for in due time. The food is good, and the only way the food sucks is if you suck at cooking, so don't suck at cooking. I recommend this place for anyone that wants to get a Korean BBQ fix in the area, especially late night.",

Hell yea... after two days of practically no sleep on alcohol and red bull all I wanted to do was eat.   My cousin Judy had brought my family here as this is Vegas's \"best AYCE Korean BBQ place\". We had waited about 15 minutes for a table of 8 to open up, I do recommend you get there early because it gets packed quick and its a pretty small place.   The regular korean side dishes and also came with salad. AYCE was $16.99 for everything, they had pork belly, beef tongue, marinated short ribs, brisket and more. Very good price considering it is an AYCE. It also comes with a salad and a bowl of rice, you can get as much as you want.   The food was marinated perfectly and I loved the brisket with the dipping sauce.   Why only four stars? Their service sucks. The servers forget easily and are always trying to get you in and out.",

    "text": "One of the best kbbq places bc of its cheap pricing (only after 10pm). I personally love the brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, squid and salad. The salad compared to other kbbq places has this amazing dressing! I'm assuming that it's a sesame oil based dressing and its delish! The brisket is more on the fatty side but fat always equals more flavor. Everything else is pretty much the same as other kbbq places.  Customer service is ok. Depending on who's the servers. I've been coming here for about a year now, I would say at least once a month. They've been improving on their customer service. Especially the guy server! He's really nice. I wish that they would check up on you a lot more and refill your water without asking.  Overall, the food and pricing makes up for their customer service. Also, be prepared to wait if you're coming from the late night special. It's totally with it though! So far tofu hut is my #1 go to for kbbq.",

We also had the brisket was not too bad but not much flavor so had to throw hot sauce on it. The pork belly was ok, if you love all of that juicy fat then that would be your go to. The steamed egg was also very good with the rice I actually enjoyed that a lot. The service was alright not always there when you need them but maybe because they started to get a little busy. Anyways, it was a good Asian bbq spot and if you around the china town area it would be a good place to have all you can eat for only $16.",

The AYCE Korean BBQ was outstanding with several meats and accompaniments available at a really cheap price.  I wouldn't say the meat was top of the line, but it wasn't poor quality either, for the price it was excellent.  The servers were prompt and friendly.  Be advised, they throw 15% tip on parties of 4 or more.  Add tip as appropriate, they work hard.",

Meat: We ordered: Beef Tongue, Pork Belly, Short Ribs, Soy Sauce Chicken, Sliced Rib Eye. The meat was fresh and marinated very well. No complaints.  Service: The service was wonderful. Servers came around frequently to remove empty plates, made sure drinks were refilled, and always asked to see if we wanted to order more food.  Cons: Probably due to the summer heat, it was very warm inside. Air condition wasn't high enough. In addition to the grilling, it was hotter than usual. The vent for the BBQ smoke wasn't strong enough, lots of smoke remained at our table instead of being pulled upward to the vent fans.  All in all, it's not bad. I gave a 4 star and will probably come back, just not on a 115-degree day.",

The ayce price is about $17 per person and you have a 90min limit. The options include: brisket, marinated ribs, beef tongue, intestines, pork belly, sausages, chicken, squid etc. You also get steamed egg and bean paste soup. The quality is not the best but it's not bad either. For the price I believe it's a great spot for you to come if you're craving korean bbq but don't want to spend too much   Decent food overall 7.5/10 but terrible service at times..",

Getting seated was confusing since there were both barbecue grills and ordinary tables. As someone else arranged eating here, we had no idea what to do, so we just took an ordinary seat.  They serve tofu soup so I got one, although the combo came with a set flavor of tofu soup (I wanted something else, but the party member that paid made me order it). It came out at a medium pace.  As far as the food's taste was concerned, it tasted more or less like any other Korean tofu place, so it's good enough.  The restrooms were fine.",

But, it's hard to beat Tofu Hut's price of $17-$18 AYCE.  One thing that is unmatched is their salad. Tofu Hut probably has one of the best salads out of all AYCE KBBQ places in Vegas. They seem to have changed their brisket... It kind of fell off. Maybe I just went on a bad day or something.  I'm not sure if I've observed wrong, but quality of food tastes better in the day time. It could be because they get super busy at night.  Service was good, as waters were refilled promptly. You can ask for a grill change, and they won't do it unless you ask most of the time. Newer KBBQ places will offer to do it, which is nice.",

I honestly still don't know how they make profit for selling the meat for such an incredible low price. Please go here if you've never been because you won't regret it.

I don't think it's simply the fact that since I go there usually 2-3 times a month that I'm recognized as a regular customer, but I observe other tables getting good service as well.  Food is pretty good, whether you decide to do the All You Can Eat or from their regular menu. The AYCE is soo good and a great value - my favorite meat is the brisket. I also love the salad greens and soups (bean paste & an egg) that come along with the meal. The banchan are some of the best I've tasted in any Korean restaurant.   Overall, good service, decent value, above-average option for lunch, dinner, or late night feasting. I'm a loyal customer and will continue to come here, as long as nothing changes.

    "text": "Why is this place still open? It is disgusting, unsanitary, and just plain G-R-O-S-S! Not only did they close down a few weeks ago because the Health Department gave them 52 DEMERITS.. 52!?!?! WOW. I'm baffled that this place is STILL open after that short restaurant closure to \"clean up\" after their mess.  Okay.. surprisingly this place USED to be good back in the day when there was a different owner around 2009? After that.. this place should just call it quits.  The last time I went here was back in 2012. I was excited because I have not been to Tofu Hut since then. When I walked in with my friend, we didn't have anyone to greet us. We stood there for a few minutes before someone came out. Whoever the lady was, was just so rude! She came out and pointed at us and said to sit anywhere. We sat at a table near the front area so they can see where we sat. After another 5 minutes, no one came by to greet us and give us a menu. I had to walk up to ask for the menu. The lady again just pointed to the corner of the table where the menus were for me to grab myself. HORRIBLE SERVICE ALREADY! At this point, I was getting really upset. When someone came by to take our orders, I did not want to get the \"AYCE\" k-bbq. I was in a time crunch and all I wanted was to eat bulgogi (shredded beef) and the house salad. I guess it was my mistake.. I should have cooked my own meat. When the meat came out.. it looked pale already. I didn't think of it then because I thought the food would taste as good as it did when I ate there last. I ate the beef.. and it tasted a little funky. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste like that. The beef tasted like it was soaked in beer.. literally.. it tasted like old beer and that it was soaked in it for hours. I thought thats how it was supposed to taste like.. I gave some to my friend to taste and she spit it right out! She said it was old and spoiled meat. Wow... was I too late or what?! I tried hiding the taste with the bland and OLD house salad. After I realized that it wasn't supposed to taste like that, I decided to just leave and get my check. I was so unhappy and STILL hungry that I just wanted to leave and not waste my time at all.  Later on that day... I started throwing up and my ass sat on my toilet for hours... I had FOOD POISONING from Tofu Hut!!!!! I was so upset and felt so disgusted. Ugh! I have NEVER been back since and when I ask a few of my friends, they all have experienced bad quality of food and bad service.  I know.. you may think that it has been 2 years since.. and that I should give it another try. Well.. after they re-opened a few weeks ago since their 52 demerits.... one of my really close friends went to eat there with her boyfriend and she found a BUG in her dish! Not just a small bug... but a big bug and she didn't even know what it was! EEEEEEWWWW! After she told me that.. I then knew that I will NEVER go back to this place.  If you want bad food service, then go here. If you want nasty, bad quality food, then go here. If you want bugs in your food, go here. If you want to get sick, then this is the place to be. This place doesn't even DESERVE a star. NO STARS FOR TOFU HUT!",

    "text": "I honestly love love Korean Barbecue. It is my absolute favorite thing to do! Tofu hut is a great place to get KBBQ. I love this place. The meat is great, the marination is a little sweet but Americans would love them. The meat that they give you is frozen. Like they had a frozen block of meat and cut them right before they give it to you so the meat is frozen when they bring it to you.  The salad is great, a little salty but still good. A long with the kimchi, salty but good. Their other sides are pretty good as well. I love love the pickled cucumber. And I don't know if it's an Asian thing or it's just them but they're very \"not attentive\" if that makes sense. Like they could careless about their customers. Every time we asked for something, they always give us this \"ugh, again?\" face. I'm Asian myself and I've worked with a lot of customers but I would never do that. They're stingy and doesn't want to give you the food. I had to order brisket and beef tongue like 3 times before I got them. If they were busy I would understand but no one was there. They just seemed very careless.  Food quality wise, it's very good and delicious.  Customer service wise, it was pretty bad.  They charged us the 18% gratuity and there was only 4 of us in our party so that's another thing. I don't mind tipping at all, I really don't. I do it according to the service that was provided but the service was pretty bad.  Usually I give more then 18% but since they want just 18% I just let them.  If you're looking for good food and don't care about service, I say go for it!  If you want service and don't want to cook your own food, I say pass.",

I don't know if the food is worth the wait, but the price definitely is!   but if you don't want Korean BBQ and you just want some Korean food, there's the other side of the restaurant for that. there's never any wait on that side, so you can seat yourself and eat pretty much right away! I really like their tofu soup there! my favorite kinds are the kimchee beef and dumpling. it's just really good and comforting!   I only gave this place 3 stars because I think of this place as just average. they're not horrible, but they're also not breathtakingly awesome, you know what I mean? but to just satisfy your Korean food craving? it'll do.",

    "text": "This is probably My go to AYCE Korean BBQ place here in Vegas. I've been here many times already with friends and so far there's nothing that much bad to say about the place so let's focus on the good.   First of all their dry meats are the best ones to go for. The marinated items just don't cut it for me. The steamed egg is always perfect and the Salad is always appetizing. $16.99 is pretty good for their prices, not too much out of the range of other AYCE places.   The only gripe I have with this place is the space and waiting times. They need to move somewhere larger. As good as their food is people come here because they want to binge and are hungry right at the moment they step in the door. To wait for another 30 minutes just to get seated kinda ruins it for some people. Parking is also an issue since there's more people coming in individually with their own cars versus people who carpool. Most times I park in the junkyard right behind the garage in front of the resto(not that I care though since the Tire shop in front of it is pretty well lit).   Overall the place is an institution with foodies and Tofu Hut has already grabbed their fair share of regulars including Me and My crew. The place just needs enlarging both in resto space and parking space. Will be coming back here expecting for more Korean BBQ awesomeness.",

The quality is really poor, the place is dirty, and they seem to have an attitude.  I could say more negetive things, but it would be pointless.

And its my first time!   The highlight: ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BBQ!!! (nom nom nom!) The price: $16.99 per person (not bad) The list of meats we picked:  - Short Ribs (my fave..so juicy and mouthwatering) - Brisket (my 2nd fave! Thin sliced and flavorful) - Boneless chicken thigh (good, a lil spicy) - Short Ribeye (good, tender, but kinda salty) - Pork Belly (taste like bacon) The Sides included: - Cucumber - Tofu  - Kimchee - (korean radishes) - a big bowl of salad   This place is \"COOK YOUR OWN SHIT!\" Lol.  So definitely it would be a cool place to eat at with friends, family, and especially A DATE! haha. that way everyone can all help out together cooking, crackn laughs, and just having a good time!

Normally would eat here, but this horrible, harassment level customer service shows that this company doesn't care about their guests. I've worked over ten years in the customer service industry and I've never been treated so cruelly before. I warn anyone who wants to eat here, please stay away.",

However, if you are NOT hungry or does not mind waiting for A LONG LONG TIME to get service, then go right ahead, this just might be the restaurant for you.  Service overall is absolutely terrible. The restaurant is so stingy that they don't give you the appetizer dishes until your main course is completely finished cooking, all other Korean restaurants give out appetizers first thing right after you've ordered food. Also, if you are just to dine there and not going there for bbq, you will wait longer because they will serve the people who goes for bbq first, and then maybe come to you.   Food is so-so. I would go to another Korean restaurant if I were you, there are so many of them on Spring Mountain Road/China Town, why come here and receive such bad service?!",

The service isn't perfect all the time, but I've been pretty satisfied recently. Of course, their salad is a plus. I ADORE THAT SALAD. I still need to get an order of it to-go. It's amazing. My favorite salad of all time :D.  I don't usually come here unless it's for the late night $13.99 special. I'm not much of a bulgogi person so I always get just pork belly and tripe. Tripe isn't everyone's thing but it's definitely MY thing. I'll eat brisket if ordered but I don't really care for it. It's not like I can eat that much in one sitting so just pork belly & tripe will do for me.  Come with a few friends so that you get a variety if you wanna try everything (in case you're not a big eater).  They'll do split checks, no problem. No troubles there so far. The bill also adds tax in it so it's a nice surprise.   This is definitely one of my to-go place for KBBQ. And their side dishes aren't too bad. Love the pancake one. :0D",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of giving out single stars but unfortunately this is a must.  It used to be that I was a regular here before they opened up better quality Korean bbq restaurants in town and provided better service, wayyyy better service.  The simple appeal of tofu hut is their late night price of 14 dollars for ayce but you also get what you pay for, McDonald's is also cheap, again you get what you pay for. Poor quality food.  The last time I came here I was actually extremely humiliated. It was for a goodbye dinner with my family. One of us who spoke Korean fluently asked about the menu to the owner, at which she said you can only order 3 items on the ayce at a time.   Okay no big deal, she could of said it a little more politely but whatever, it's packed, they're stressed we understand.  So we ordered the brisket, bulgogi, and the beef tong-\"THATS IT NO MORE.\"  And just like that the owner cut us off and turned her back and walked away. WOW completely rude. Did we really just wait an hour to be treated like this?? Water cups were practically never filled, I think we had to ask 3 times whenever we needed a grill changed since I was breathing in more second hand smoke than at a cigar shop..  The food was low quality compared to the other Korean bbq places like gen djk and hwaro. There's always about an hour wait for their late night prices, and so far from the last 3 times I went, service was nonexistent..the last experience I just wrote being the worst.  And FYI, it's always the same Korean owner lady who treats us poorly. I guess that's how you treat your regulars? Okay that's cool, there's better Korean bbq places just down the road anyways. *Cough cough* ones that haven't been shut down for too many demerits due to health code violations *cough cough* And with more ample parking, less of a wait, better quality, and manners maketh restaurant..Ehem, better service!  I bid thee adieu, adieu, parting is such sweet sorr..\"NOPE! ITS SUCH SWEET BLISS!\"",

    "text": "I always pass this place on Spring Mountain and see that it is always packed. I went in one time with my family when I found out that it wasn't only a Tofu house but also a All you can eat Korean Bbq place. Unfortunately there are only a few tables for the BBQ (the other half of the restaurant is the tofu restaurant) that they told us the wait would be over an hour and a half. Because we did not want to wait, we left. I was able to try this restaurant without having to wait on a Thursday night and I am happy that I was able to try it out.  All you can eat Korean BBQ for $16.99 (Anytime/90 minute limit) or $13.99 (Late Night Special 10PM- 2AM/ 90 minute limit). There is a minimum of 2 persons for a BBQ table so if you are planning on eating here on a date with yourself you're out of luck. The choice of meats are as follows:  *Marinated Sliced Ribeye- One of my top favorites. It was tender and marinated well. Not to much \"fat\" on the meat which to me is a plus. *Brisket- Another one of my top favorites. It is also one of the quickest to cook since it is thinly sliced. It was good to snack on while waiting for the other meats to cook. *Pork Belly- Another one of my top favorites. Was of good quality and was extremely tasty. *Beef Tongue *Tripe, Honeycomb *Squid *Marinated Sliced Pork Belly *Boneless Chicken Thigh- One of my top favorites. Note: this takes a lot longer to cook. I recommend putting this on the grill first! *Bean paste soup *Short Ribs *Steam Egg- YUM!!!  I absolutely loved the sides. The bean sprouts and fish paste were amazing!  The only thing that I disliked about this place was now it was designed. Like i said, half of the restaurant is for the Tofu House/Restaurant and the other half was for the Korean Bbq. The Bbq tables are close to each other so when i was seated and eating, my chair was touching the guys behind me the whole time and I would have to stand up when anyone from their table had to get up to use the restroom or go outside. It was pretty annoying.",

Their late night all you can eat special is only 13.99 and that's a hard price to beat. It's a small clean restaurant. We had ordered a lot of different cuts of meats and they brought out the food pretty quick. It tasted very fresh so no complaints there!  It was very busy but I really wish our waiter had checked up on us more. You have to flag them down to get a new clean grill. Other than that no issues here.

The service was prompt and \"asian\" friendly.  What I mean by that is that asian servers don't usually engage with the patron as like other types of restaurants/cultures.  That said, our server was fine, and gave service with a sort of smile. She was by no means rude or testy.  This was only my 2nd time at a cook-your-own spot.  We ordered the marinated sliced ribeye, beef tongue, short ribs , and brisket. We also had the steamed egg. The meat items were all very tasty and tender, except for the tongue, which is on the chewy side, but that's probably how it is.  The ribs was especially melt-in-your-mouth tender.  The steamed egg was a nice counter to all that meat.  The meats were preceded by the usual pickled vegetables, kimchi, and a nice vegetable tossed salad. The rice was very good also.  All-in-all, this was a tasty and fun experience.  And it's such a great bargain!  Thumbs up all around.",

I have tried their AYCE which is very good, under $20 for dinner and even cheaper for lunch. The meat is good, fewer side dishes than other places, but you can order bean paste soup and steamed eggs with your AYCE, which not every place has.   The best deal is their combinations, listed under \"Lunch Specials\" but we have ordered this for dinner too. For 4 people, we usually order a Chicken Combo and a Rib combo, which comes with the two meats, and two soups. Order 2 extra rice and everyone is happy, satisfied and stuffed! Comes out to under $40 for 4 people for very good food!   Have been coming here for years and will continue to come back. Service is good, we come so often the waitress there remembers us and usually asks if we are doing the same as we always do :)",

Service was good, but it wasnt that busy when we were there, but we did take the last bbq table at 1p on a Monday afternoon.  I'll definitely return, but with more people so we dont waste food.",

The atmosphere is lively and service wonderful. They won't come around and cook for you unless you really need it. Which I prefer.   The restaurant is small, half is dedicated to BBQ and the other half to normal dining. The wait is long. Make no mistake about it you'll have to wait. Do yourself a favor and grab a seat in the sparsely populated normal dining area, get a few bottles of soju and cass, and pour each other Somaek as you wait. The food will taste much better anyway when you're all drunk and having fun.",

I am so thankful that I was introduced to this place, the place where I lost my KBBQ-ginity. Since leaving Vegas, I have been to many Korean bbq restaurants, but none compare to Tofu Hut.  I wish there was a tofu hut convenient everywhere I go! I miss it so much; the delicious sides, sauces, salad, THE MEATS. Everything about this place is perfect. The price? AMAZING.  I have heard a lot of rumors about this place being unclean, but I don't even care their food is to die for. Some of my friends hate tofu hut, so Im assuming its a hit or miss for everyone.  But for me its a hit straight to my heart. I miss this place so much and I plan on going every time I visit Vegas.",

When I finally made my way over there with a fellow vegetarian (the only person who could possibly be as excited as I was about a restaurant called \"Tofu Hut\"), I have to say we VERY disappointed.  As far as I could tell, there were only two tofu dishes on the entire menu.  And they both had meat in them, too.  This was apparently more of a Korean BBQ place than a vegetarian haven.  Not only was its name misleading, I found the inside to be very unclean... When I ate there the first time, I didn't touch my food.  Needless to say, I wouldn't eat there again.  Ever.",

I loved their salad that came with the bbq and the banchan was pretty good too. The service wasn't all that great and the place was a little cramped but the good food made up for it.

Just what we needed to tie us over in our alcohol drenched evening.  I guess the name is a bit of a misnomer.  I don't really think you're supposed to come here and enjoy their \"tofu mastery\" (isn't there another \"tofu\" place right across the street?).  From what was relayed to me by a local, this is the place to come for Korean \"street\" food like ddukbokki (spicy rice cakes) and odeng (fish cake soup).  This place loves jalapenos like Ricky loves Lucy.  We found traces of it on the ddukbokki, the marinated pork and the chicken wings.  We even expected to find some in the fish cake soup but no such luck.  No one is perfect, after all.  +1 for being relatively close to the strip.  The crew and I will definitely mark this for another go the next time we're in town.",

The flavor is great. We specially like the ribeye, short ribs and the brisket. My son loves the steamed egg. I did not like the squid and the chicken. The sides are good as well specially the long noodles. One thing I did not like is the long wait. It gets really crowded on their bbq area. I wish they turn the other dining area into bbq area as well.  Also, when they get busy...you will wait for your meat to come. Couple times the servers forgot about our meat coz they were too busy and not enough servers. It is still one of our fave korean bbq! Love this place!",

If you are making a post-club visit, be smart like me, and leave your club clothes in the car. Come in with just a t-shirt and pants. Your clothes will smell like Seoul when you are done. 2. Bring your hunger. Drunk. Sober. High. Low. Whatever.  3. Order the salad with your banchan (side dishes for you amateurs). 4. This place is the epitome of an ethnic restaurant. It's not fancy, it's not pretty. Leave your pretentious bitchy friends outside. In the cold, winter weather. Or in the hot, hot heat. Make them more miserable. :D 5. Marinated pork belly, beef tongue, brisket are excellent choices. 6. Get rice. 7. It makes sense to order some Hite (Korean Beer) 8. It's all you can eat, so don't be shy. Have no shame in your food game (I stole that from my friend Kurdy S.) 9. The grill is at your table, so you grill it yourself. You run the show! 10. Don't plan on doing anything after this meal because you will be so full!  I love this place!",

Me and my friends each ordered the all you can eat buffets, and each paid about $20 with tax and tip included. And we also got plenty of side dishes! I love Korean side dishes, and expect them to be at every Korean restaurant I go to. The kimchee wasn't that good, but the tofu, cucumber, sprouts, and noodles were some of my favorites. Ooh and the salad was good too. I was not that thrilled about cooking some of the meats myself, but after awhile of seeing my friends go at it, I ended up doing it, and it wasn't bad. I definitely liked the short ribs, the squid, and the the spicy pork belly. I was in a lot of pain afterwards, but sometimes food coma and that bloated feeling is worth it. I guess.",

    "text": "$17 all day for all you can eat Korean BBQ. What a great price. The menu has about 10 items on it, typical Korean fare - except for the amazing rib eye. It is absolutely utterly a work of art. It's rare to get a meat that is so tender and soft it just melts in your mouth. The marinades and sweet tangy flavors will tickle your tastebuds. I am positive I could have ordered 3 or 4 plates of this and a half cup of rice and been in food heaven.  As for the rest: korean appetizers - very good peanut salt & pepper dip and fish cakes rib eye - a bit dry, like pho well done flank, nothing special steamed egg - a fluffy egg similar to that in soups except in one piece. it works really well with meat and rice, I recommend it marinated short ribs - very good, but if you've had korean bbq you've had it 200 times marinated pork belly - fatty and a korean bacon clone, tasty but too much fat boneless chicken breast - took forever to cook and was pretty bland, nothing special here  This place is open til 5am for the drunks in Vegas and has a special cheaper price after 11pm I believe.  Definitely worth coming to again for the rib eye.",

They made us wait an hour and they finally sat us- at the table that was open this entire time!!!  We did the all you can eat and it was only $16.99.

The wait was horrible. About 45 minutes. When we were seated, the server did not explain ANYTHING to us. This is one of those places where you cook your own food. We had to GOOGLE instructions for how long to cook certain things. I have been to other places where you cook your own food and they explain the minutes to cook certain foods for and are generally available with any questions. We never saw our server again.  You guessed it...it came out awful. But it wasn't just our awful cooking skills (which I do take partial blame for) but the meat was incredibly disgusting. Dry, room temperature, grey, sometimes brown, just looked like it had been sitting out for a long time. Also the sides were equally disgusting so I know it wasn't all because we cooked it badly. It just tasted like they left yesterday's food out on the counter and brought us that to eat.  I didn't get sick from it but it just left a disgusting taste in my mouth and my stomach. I actually found myself purposely vomiting as my own vomit tasted better than their garbage food. I wanted it out of my system immediately. The thought of it makes me want to hurl again.  I don't see what the hype is about this place: bad service, bad food. Will never return. I don't have other Korean BBQ spot recommendations but don't come here.",

This is the go to place for kbbq for my group of friends and I.  16.99 from opening till 10pm 13.99 from 10pm to 3am   The food here is not bad, the meat, depending on which one you choose, is usually frozen unless it is marinated. The marinade they use is good but like any marinated kbbq causes the grill to toast over. The meat is fresh and is yummy when it's really late. Finally, the sides that come with the food are good.   The service is there is hit or miss. Some days it is really good and others it was a bit lackluster. This is understandable, people have their good days and their bad days. They are very quick in taking your order and brining your order out.  Overall not a bad place to grab some late night kbbq, I know you can find me there after my work for some late night munchies.",

Seeing that it has 3.5 stars, I thought it should be ok.   The furniture was old and raggety looking, especially the torn up cushion on the chairs, but nevertheless, I should try the food.  The menu needed some wiping done since it was covered with sauce.  Ewww.  Anyways, we decided on the beef seafood sundubu and a plate of kalbi.  When the older lady waitress came back to take our order, she was so impatient and short.  We wanted to understand their spicy level so we asked if the spicy level is Korean spicy, she said it's not that spicy.  So we continue to ask her at what level she would order it and she said she don't know since she doesn't eat spicy.  WTF!?!  Her ill-mannerism and major bad attitude continued and I wanted to leave right there and then but my friend wanted to try out the food at least.  Ahhhhh!!!  When we paid the bill, she walked by and hurriedly grab the receipt.  I was pissed that my friend tipped her because truthfully, she did not deserve a penny for the crappy service she gave.  Food was sub-par, nothing special.  I will never ever come back to this crappy place with this crappy ajumma waitress.",

    "text": "So I know a lot of people complain about Tofu Hut's service, and especially with it being slow (which I completely agree) .. but the food here in my opinion is delicious and one of the better Korean restaurant in China Town.   I've been going to Tofu Hut since before they started having their all you can eat bbq special.. and that was when I noticed the place had picked up a lot more than before. The workers here are all the same workers from the beginning, which is why I think they should really hire more so that 2 women (the normal amount of servers even at 3 AM) don't try to cater to half a side of all you can eat parties and half a side of regular dine ins. It's just too much plates to serve and demands for them to keep up. Every time I go there, I can tell the waitresses are flustered and there's not a time I don't see them run around like crazy. The all you can eat large groups is just too much for them to handle with a small staff.  The food on the other hand is very good, especially their bulgogi, and tofu soups. Their kimchi beef soup is my favorite because it has the perfect blend of sour and spice. This is the one place where I think their spice levels are accurate, and if you order very spicy.. it will come out very spicy! The only thing that I noticed with their broth is that it is very deep in color (like a deep orange red). Even if you order it not spicy, the color will still be as red which I'm unsure of the cause.. Perhaps its food coloring or the oil they use... But the color almost looks artificial sometimes. (Someone needs to do research on that. I haven't died yet from eating it lol)  Their bulgogi combo is my favorite. It comes with tofu soup and bulgogi. Bulgogi is their thinly sliced beef, marinated with scallions, onions and korean spices, served on a sizzling iron pan. The meat contains a perfect amount of fat to make it taste extra special when you eat it with rice. Their bulgogi is slightly on the sweeter side.. but not too sweet or salty. It almost taste like Korean kalbi ribs, with the texture of extremely thin sliced beef so it melts in your mouth.. I really think it taste wonderful and something worth trying!   Lastly, their sides are also very good. They sometimes serve glass noodles and potato salad, which is my favorite.. They are the only place in town that are gracious with their side dishes and will give you a decent amount even if it is for one person.  If you ignore the service, and concentrate on the food quality, I'd definitely pick Tofu Hut any day.",

We sat in the section where you get to grill your own food, ordered just about every type of meat on the menu as it was four of us, we were hungry, and we wanted to try everything. I honestly cant remember one thing that I thought was good. The meat was so bland and tasteless! The sides were not very good either.   It could be that I am just not used to this type of food but in my opinion it was not very good at all. Mind you I was HUNGRY when I went here.

    "text": "Korean BBQ in Vegas isn't anywhere close to Korean BBQ in SoCal. For real. But you get what you can get and Tofu Hut is the place to get your Korean BBQ fix for a decent price.  During their regular hours AYCE is $16.99, while late night (10 PM - 3 AM) is priced at $13.99. Not too shabby, considering you can get as much meat as you want. They offer a good variety - brisket, bulgogi (marinated beef), thick pork belly slices, tripe, squid, beef tongue and a few others. I'm a fan of the brisket, personally. You can't go wrong with ultra thin slices of beef dipped in their sesame oil/pepper sauce! The marinade on the bulgogi is decent, nothing to rave about. The pork belly is pretty fatty, just a warning.   Side dishes are just as important to a Korean BBQ meal as the meat itself. There wasn't a lot of side dishes - kimchi, spicy cucumbers, japchae (stir-fried vermicelli noodles), fishcakes, steamed egg and a pre-dressed salad (essential for any Korean BBQ meal). This may sound like a lot, but really good BBQ places offer a lot more, probably twice as much. I was longing for some bean paste, maybe some garlic and jalapenos. Perhaps I'm asking for too much. After all, you get what you pay for.   So why the name 'Tofu Hut' when this place is popular for their Korean BBQ? Before the BBQ times, they once strictly sold a variety of soondubu (soft tofu stew). You can get this from not-so-spicy at all to ultra spicy, all depends on your taste buds. They still have this here and are decently priced. But why spend a near ten bucks on a mediocre soondubu dish if you can pay a few dollars more and eat like a king?",

The place is small, the service is BAD but hey your doing the cooking so their BAD service I've learned to brush off. It has been a hit or miss for us.

    "text": "Had a random k-bbq craving the other day and decided to try tofu hut. It's been my go to place for Korean food, but my first time w their $16.99 ayce.   Started out rocky - it was half empty but we stood waiting to be seated for what felt like forever, while the frazzled server and busser both ignored us. There were a few other service issues to follow but sadly, authentic Asian places aren't known for great service. It is what it is.   Anyway, food was great - decent selection of banchan (the sides), a surprisingly delish salad of romaine and cabbage mixed w a light dressing and I think kochujung sauce. We ordered bulgogi, kalbi short ribs, spicy chicken and spicy pork. The meat quality and marinade was really good, but I'm not a fan the marinade on pork and chicken. Both lacked flavor and the pork had really excessive fat and gristle.   Although not included in ayce we got an order of the fried mandoo, which seemed to be homemade and a pretty generous portion. Also got the spicy tofu soup, which arrived boiling hot and yummy. Tried the steamed egg, which was incorrectly described as kind of a custard. It was more like a really fluffy omelette - seemed like a scrambled raw egg poured onto a little bit of boiling broth w green onion. Surprisingly good, must try.  Service was mediocre with just 1 poor guy running around and the busser girl who spoke no English - she just stared at us although I'm pretty sure coke is still coke in Spanish too. Things got better once one of the cooks came out to help wait tables, he was actually an awesome server. I'd suggest ordering everything at once while you have their attention, and you have to be pretty aggressive about flagging them down.   Sounds like a pretty bad experience, but it is probably my fav of the ayce k-bbq places over sura and woo che. Quality seemed better and a good selection of ban chan. The main negative compared to others is that they're not good about changing out the grill as the charred bits get stuck, but they probably would if you ask. And like with all k-bbq places, just be prepared to smell like Korean food the rest of the night.",

    "text": "Needing some food to sop up the bacchanalia, I immediately thought of meat + rice comfort.   The BF and I came here for the $13.99 AYCE. This is different from some of the daytime known AYCE KBBQ since it's all table service and not a buffet line.   For banchan we had- fish cakes, korean pancake, bean sprouts, napa kimchee, cucumber kimchee, chap chae. They serve you a bowl of rice and a large bowl of salad. I wasn't feeling the chap chae seasoning, but the rest of the banchan was good. I liked the lightly sweet and tangy dressing on the salad which went well with all the meats.   For meat choices you can get- brisket, thin sliced ribeye, pork belly, marinated pork belly, squid, tripe, tongue, chicken thigh. Also ayce bean paste soup. You can upgrade your ayce to include short rib and steamed egg for $16.99.   We got the ribeye, marinated pork belly, and tongue for our meats. Ribeye had a nice marinade to it which a lot of places lack flavor. Pork belly was with a spicy marinate with onions and pretty good once you let the fat get crispy since they slice it very thin. Tongue is always my favorite- cooks fast and great with salad. Since they plate the meat for you, they sometimes serve a bit more than I want of one of the meats so if you want to taste a lot, ask maybe for small serving.   I was worried about the service after reading reviews, but the service was good. Our water was refilled and refills on food came out quickly. It wasn't very busy, but the guy watching our tables cared to check on people which makes a big difference.   Good late night eats and good value. Definitely will be back.",

Wish they would have explained what was what when they brought the extras, as I ended up eating some fishcake thinking it was seitan (silly me for thinking they'd bring us vegetarian stuff after telling them we were vegetarian). Other than that, I barely felt disdain from the service staff.  I got a laugh that they have a Spice level lower than mild (it's called \"white\" - hah!). Kudos for telling it like it is. I had the mild and probably could have had the medium without worry ( I is not good with spice). One of our party got \"Spicy\" and he said it wasn't.   Unlike other yelpers, none of us had a bad return once we got home. :)",

First, we sat down and the waitress served us two bowls of salad, I'm not sure if the salad dressing is store bought or homemade, but it was pretty tasty and the salad was fresh and crisp.   Then came the side dishes/appetizers and we got quite a few, 9 dishes. most were really yummy except for the potato salad (?) it looked like a scoop of ice cream, ha.   Finally our main dishes came, Kimchi Beef Tofu + Bulgogi and the BF and I really enjoyed it, it was perfect for the chilly weather outside. The tofu soup was flavorful and they didn't skimp on the beef, unlike other places. The bulgogi was really well marinated and yummy too.   Also, the prices are very reasonable. $30.00 for two tofu soups + bulgogi + side dishes and drinks.   We will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "So my mission for an AYCE Korean barbecue restaurant in Las Vegas has finally come to an end! Last night I started feeling a grumble in my tummy and I knew that I was hungry. I wanted to try a new restaurant but wasn't too sure where I could go at 10 pm on a Thursday night. I needed both a place  that could fill my food standards and my hunger. I had heard a lot about Tofu Hut so decided to give it a try.  Once arriving at the restaurant, the server was very prompt in seating us and taking our order. The Banchan came out just a few moments after. Most were different from the other Korean Barbecue restaurants I have been to, but they were all very tasty. My favorite of the dishes was the Oi Sobeagi, also known as cucumber kimchi. It had the right amount of spicy and wasn't too overwhelming like others I have had before.   The meat was all very flavorful and delicious. We ate the brisket and marinated beef mostly. For all you Samgyeopsal (pork belly) lovers out there, I recommend ordering it marinated. It adds a little more flavor to the pork belly making it even more delicious.   My only complaint is that they did not have the usual dipping sauce that is served at most Korean Barbeque places. The sauce the did have was unique, but not my favorite.  Recommendation: They have a special there from 10 pm - 2 am where you can get AYCE for $13.99, instead of the usual $16.99! I recommend going around that time to save a few dollars.",

    "text": "Not all that great but it's just so cheap. Of the stuff we ordered, my least favorite would have to be the marinated rib-eye. The marinade was pretty bad. I also would not reorder the marinated pork belly, as that's cut into strand like pieces, not large thick slices like the regular pork belly. Speaking of the pork belly, not as thick as I like that other places do. The first round of brisket we ordered was good. The second round however was cut so thin that it just kept flaking apart as we tried cooking it. Picking up shreds of meat is not a fun way to eat. This was probably related to the service.  So speaking of the service, it wasn't that bad if you consider they were seriously understaffed. Every BBQ-able table was filled up, which is a little more than half the restaurant. As far as I could tell, there was one server and one person working the kitchen.  The orders of meat usually come out in pretty small quantities on a small plate too. Don't know why they did that while being understaffed. The salad mix they give you on the side is delicious, probably my favorite Korean BBQ salad anywhere.  Eventually we stopped eating because: 1. it took so long to get our next order of meat and more salad (I think they ran out and kept having to make more) and 2. the grill was so small that it was hard for everyone to keep eating at a good pace.  Even with all the negative comments, I'd still give it 3 stars because it's decent and so affordable.",

Among the violations, employees not properly washing their hands, spoiled food, food unprotected from potential contamination, ineffective pest control measures and more. Just google 'tofu hut dirty' and you'll see. Can't believe this place is still open. I will report them to SNDH and hopefully this place won't stay open for long. God this place is trash!!!",

    "text": "Our go to whenever we have a basic craving for yakiniku meats!  If you've been to a restaurant on Spring Mountain during peak dinner hours, you'll know that parking is scarce and lines to wait can be cumbersome because of seating and because Asians love to eat in large groups for some reason. I know this, because I am Asian and I love eating with the entire fam bam.  Tofu hut is perfect if you want your basic yakiniku meats. It's also awesome if you and your party arrive right before 6pm because they can usually seat you right away. Otherwise, there is a list you sign in on and a small bench you can sit on to wait. Oh and I highly advise that you listen very carefully because there was one time that my party was waiting for 45 minutes till we noticed other parties were being seated before us because we were bypassed. The hostess said she called our name and no one responded. I'm sure one of the five of us who were waiting on the bench would've heard it.  The women's restroom in this establishment isn't that bad, usually well stocked and clean. I always wash my hands before we get our meats so I've visited the restroom over 7 times already.  We've never had any alcohol here before, but there is a small list of available beers and soju available on the back of the menu. The sides are mediocre, I only really eat the kimchi and the salad...I love the salad. The only meat I don't really enjoy cooking and eating is the ribeye, it's not like a steak or something...expect shredded meat instead. Everything else is great, even the squid which I enjoy. My kids love brisket, tongue, and pork belly. We don't ever get chicken so I'm not sure if they even have chicken available and what it would look like. They could use some soy sauce and hot sauce on the table but if you need it they're happy to provide it when asked. They have kids rates. So kids aren't free depending on age but it's not that bad because some places will charge you half the adult rate for a 3yr old which is kind of ridiculous given that the average 3yr old doesn't eat everything you feed them and is way to fascinated with all the cooking action that's going on to even think of eating.  Five stars because I've always had a great experience here with my family even after that whole wait list mix up.",

BUT for a first experience, it wasn't that good but wasn't bad either. I didn't like any of the food, the chicken spicy thigh was the alright one of them all. But my rating won't be based on the food since I didn't really eat anything.   The service there was friendly but then they stop after being there for a couple minutes, eventually they did bring out the things we asked for, but it took a while to do so. They seemed to take better care of everyone else.   I don't like the fact that if we \"over order\" the food we will be charged for it.  Also, I think HAVING to be basically forced to leave a tip is ridiculous. I think you should earn the tip; you shouldn't be forced to have to leave one, they just make it part of the bill. Cause then they don't even need to be nice cause they're getting a tip regardless.   Also, if we are spending $16.99 PER PERSON already, for an ALL YOU CAN EAT I think drinks should be included rather than being overpriced. The total was not worth it in my opinion. Never coming back, because of the service and cause I just don't like Korean food.. sorry!",

Maybe they don't have the best cuts of meat, maybe the selection is small, maybe the banchan isn't that great but for under $17 for all you can eat this place certainly satisfies the craving for Korean barbeque.     I would suggest their kalbi and and their steamed egg.  Almost always delicious even if sometimes it's a miss.",

Rice didn't come in a stone pot, and when we asked the server why it didn't, she said because we didn't ask. Lol smfh.   For a place that's called tofu hut, I ought to kick the tofu out of this hut.

I guess it's good for the price you pay but I still prefer to pay a little more to have the things I do like. We did the all you can eat yakiniku (they have the other side which has more options but not ayce style). We came with a party of 11 no reservations so it was a semi long wait. The wait did seem forever because we were starving. We all wanted to sit at 1 table as well instead of being separated (4 of the 11 were children) so we figured we could fit but boy was it a super tight squeeze! I say 9 people is comfortable on their big table, if you go with a party bigger than that be prepared to sit separately. The waiter was pretty attentive and I'm glad he left the pitcher of water close enough for me to grab because I'm one of those people who drink a lot of water and if I wait a long time for it to be filled I start to get annoyed. Parking isn't the greatest. Luckily we went at night when the other businesses are closed but I can image that it's hard to find parking during the day. I'm not positive that I would come to this place again just because of my personal preferences. But if you are hungry and want something that's cheaper/reasonably priced this place is good for you. It wasn't horrible it just wasn't what I was expecting or hoping.",

I really like the atmosphere this setup creates, promoting camaraderie and making a fun dining experience. For AYCE you have a selection of chicken/beef/pork/squid to go along with a salad mix and several condiments scattered around the table. Our first batch of meats were actually quite tasty and the salad and condiments were enough of a change of pace to keep things interesting. Unfortunately the second round seemed to drop in quality and became unwanted. The others in my group also noticed the taste and it was a struggle to finish. The steamed egg was a highlight and the price was definitely reasonable. Too bad the second round of meat was underwhelming.",

Even though there are more kbbq places now, Tofu hut will always have a special place in my heart. 5 years ago, Tofu hut was my first Korean BBQ experience in Las Vegas.   It does get busy and there can be a long wait. Especially if you are a big party. The service is ok. It depends on how busy they are but they try to get the meat out quick. I remember there was a gentleman that worked there and every time we came in he remembered our order. He doesn't work there anymore though. After 10pm their price is amazing and affordable. But it gets super busy around this time as well.   The meats are ok. We normally get the beef tongue, brisket, short ribs, pork belly, and squid. You do get a lot, which is nice because we don't have to keep ordering. Their salad is AMAZING! It is my favorite out of all the kbbq places I have ate at! It is really the best one. They also offer Korean pancake as a side. I recommend warming it up a little bit on the grill to make it a little firmer. They can also give everyone a steam egg and bean paste soup, unlike other places. Which is nice because I don't have to share.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I've been to practically every KBBQ spot in town, so I'm aware of the alternatives. With that said, there's something about Tofu Hut that keeps me coming back (sometimes twice in the same week)!  I've done both sides: AYCE and a la carte, more often recently the latter. We've been coming so frequently that they know my order before they can get me a glass of water. Their bean paste stew with a side of steamed egg is my go-to, especially on cold winter days like today. Funny enough, both of these can be ordered on the AYCE side as well. I prefer their bean paste soup over others' for two reasons: 1) it's always boiling hot when it gets to my table and stays hot, and 2) it's at a preferable spice level. I also swear by their water. There is a magical quality about it that just quenches thirst in a way no other does. The staff is generally on it about refilling your water as well, I swear it's almost as if they've spiked it and are trying to get you to a state of ecstasy. On the AYCE side, the meat isn't exactly premium quality and there isn't a wide selection but you definitely get what you pay for. I normally opt for the brisket and pork belly, and their salad is also my #1 amongst KBBQ salads. This place is also the only KBBQ where I enjoy each and every one of the small side dishes they serve (also refillable and on both sides); most places will have 2 or 3 I won't touch. Overall, Tofu Hut comes in clutch when I'm looking for a relatively cheap KBBQ meal.   There really isn't much I can complain about. The size of the restaurant is small, so wait times can get pretty long for AYCE. But on the other side, seating is almost always instant. I know people complain about certain staff members being cold or rude, but I give them the benefit of the doubt and attribute that to a common Asian feature known as RBF (resting b**** face, which I too suffer from, so I can relate). Another common complaint is that the restaurant could be a little cleaner, but that doesn't stop me from coming back time and again.   All in all, Tofu Hut isn't top notch KBBQ, but it checks all my boxes and I'm perfectly happy with that.",

I stopped by the Tofu Hut and wanted to have some Korean BBQ. I told the waiter I wanted the BBQ. He seated me on a table with no grill on and brought over a menu. I told him I am here for the BBQ and he gave me a very contempt look and told me that they don't ALLOW one person to have all you can eat BBQ. Seriously? Is that even legal to refuse service based on headcount? What if someone just feels like to have some damn Korean BBQ and nobody at the moment can join him? What makes it even better is that after I told him that is what I want to eat he told me to go somewhere else. Are you fXXing serious? Common decency would at least say I am sorry we can't accommodate one person.(even though it is ridiculous). Anyhow, Thank you Tofu Hut, for making my difficult day even harder. I am glad that I did go somewhere else. Way better service and food. I sincerely hope you guys go out of business. Thank you! Tofu Hut!",

But this place didn't disappoint.   They brought out banchan and I practically got full off of dipping the fishcakes in the salt & pepper sesame oil. These appetizers are so good! I also really like their steamed egg. Then they brought out the meats and, woah, I thought I was already full. My favorite was the brisket and rib eye. I didn't really care for the chicken.

    "text": "I give Tofu Hut 5/5 because it is my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ in Las Vegas.  The prices are fantastic, $16.99 anytime and $13.99 for late night (10p-2a). I would recommend just ordering the $16.99 whenever you go because you'll be able to get the garan-jjim (steamed egg) which comes out sizzling hot and the kalbi (marinated short ribs).   It's a pretty popular AYCE KBBQ as I don't recall a time I haven't had to wait for a table. There's two sides to the restaurant, one where you can order all you can eat and the other for those who prefer to order off of the menu. I've tried both and am a fan of both, however, I prefer Tofu Hut for the Korean BBQ.   The service is good; they bring you out waters, banchan (Korean side dishes), salad, and take your order shortly after being seated. They give you salt and pepper in sesame oil for dipping sauce but you can also request for the soybean paste or soy sauce and vinegar if you like. There's always plenty of banchan provided, which are very tasty, and the servers happily refill them when requested. I love the salad they give you here... The dressing is amazing and the salad pairs perfectly with the BBQ.   Tofu Hut does not compare to the Korean BBQs in LA, but for Vegas... It is definitely the place to go for AYCE KBBQ. 5 stars for me and highly recommended!",

The place was small but had a nice quaint decor. The place was very clean as well.  I'm a huge fan of Yakiniku places and I think I'm a fan of Tofu Hut.  From the array of small Kim Chee dishes to the nicely cute and marinated meats, even the simple salad with the very addiction asian vinaigrette gave the complete that final touch.  The waiter was always checking on our table to replenish at the appropriate times - never imposing or to often to be a bother.  The price was just right for a place like this.  Unlike most Korean BBQ buffets, the food is brought to the table in portions and to as much as your liking, wherein in other buffets, the food and meats are often exposed at the mercy of the dining patrons.  #IsThatSanitary?  Stop by for lunch, bring a friend or two, and enjoy some good food & good conversation.  :)",

Overall experience:  For $16.99, you pretty much get all the necessary meats available ranging from brisket thru short ribs...  Many places in LA offers different price points for different cuts of meat, but in the end, don't we all just get the same meat every single time?  This place serve it just right!  Oh yeah, they also have steamed egg as well... need I say more?  Pros:   Parking Meat selection No Hassle Efficient staff  Cons: Small restaurant Limited servers Limited seating area for AYCE KBBQ Potentially a long wait  Will I go back here? You betcha!  Great food, awesome Steamed Egg, easy parking, and decent pricing make this place my new go-to KBBQ joints in Vegas!",

For under $20 (even cheaper after 10pm), it is all you can eat. It comes with the Korean side dishes, Salad, and of course rice. Their meat selection isn't that big but for the price, it's not bad at all. I love their briskets because it is probably one of the fastest to cook. Their squid is also really good, just takes a little long to cook. Marinated chicken is really good but I think it's a bit too salty. They're pen until 2am and the last seating is supposed to be at 12:50 but I've seen them turn away customers before 12:50. I highly recommend this place if you don't mind grilling your own food. Under the tables, the grill can get very hot. I didn't know this but I learned it the hard way last night. so be very careful. Lol",

    "text": "If you are look for a good place to eat at Vegas and it is after 10:00PM this is the place to go. You would want to come with an empty stomach since this place is a All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. I dare you to come out of this place not smelling like Korean BBQ. So if you plan to go to a party after you might wanna bring a change of clothes. If this is your first time trying Korean BBQ let me tell you that the smell will linger on your clothes and hair.   This is an AYCE location starting at 10:00pm-2:00am and it only cost $18-20 depending on the tipping amount. This is a great deal since NYC prices are outrageous of this type of food. Along with the Korean BBQ meat that you order it comes with Banchan. Banchan are small tradition Korean side dishes such as kimchee, bean sprout, fish cake, pancake etc. If these dishes run out you can always ask for more. I am used to my basket of fresh lettuce but instead they served chop lettuce with some dressing. This is a complete shock to me, maybe the basket of fresh lettuce is a NYC thing. The basket of fresh lettuce here is served like a salad with a fresh sesame dressing.   I will recommend  this brisket, marinated pork belly and sliced sliced rib-eye. I will stay away from the squid because it comes really elastic when it is cooked. The marinated pork belly was my favorite because it comes with so much favor. Keep in mind that this place does not change the Korean BBQ grill. Since the pork belly is marinated the grill turns black quicker and they will not replace it until you finish the dinner.   The restaurant is split into two parts. When you walk in the left side is for Korean BBQ quest. They have 6 tables that can seat 4 people each and 3 long table that can hold at least 8 individuals. The right side are for guest who do not want to eat Korean BBQ but just want Korean food.   The only reason this place lost a star is because of service and the wait. I came at 10:03pm and had to wait for an hour to get seated. The service is slow and they seem like zombies. When the table before us finish eating it took 10 minutes to clean the table and when the table was clean the waitress did not call us until another 10 minutes has passed. So the turn around rate for the table is around 20 minutes because they lack the help. Since only two people are working it takes a lot longer for wait and the meat to come out. If they hired more help this place would have earn five stars.   Hint: When you walk in place your name, time you came in and number in your party on that sheet of paper near the door. This place get pack after 10:15pm!",

Once seated on the BBQ side, our waitress then move us back to the Non-BBQ side. Huh??  We got seated, and the waitress brought is 3 glasses of water and disappeared. I had to go to the front desk to ask for menus... Then she took our order and another 20 min later, we were waving our hands to get the waitress's attention, but they walked past us at least 5 times. We finally got our ban chan after the 20 minute mission of trying to get her attention. 10 minutes after that, our food came.  I ordered the mushroom soondubu, which was basically all tofu. I counted exactly three mushrooms... I had to take half of the tofu out of the soup but it was still just tofu. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of tofu, but I thought I ordered tofu SOUP.. Not just tofu.  My friend ordered kimchi jjigae, which was ok.. You can't really go wrong with the simplest Korean dish. She also ordered chadol (beef brisket), which was over-cooked and chewy, so we sent it back.   My other friend ordered dwenjang jjigae, which was alright, but didn't really taste like dwenjang jjigae.   Next we asked our server for some napkins, and he brings us one napkin... Lol is this some kind of joke?!  I didn't expect to eat amazing Korean food in Vegas, but I didn't expect the food to be so foul. Horrible food. Horrible service. I vow to never step foot in Tofu Hut.. More like unappetizing tofu cardboard box.",

    "text": "I do like this place. Been hitting it up for months during the happy hour. It's open late, the all-you-can eat price is very reasonable. The staff seem tired and sad a lot of the time, but they are friendly and attentive.  I recommend the marinated beef. It's the best thing on the menu, imo. Cooking right at the table is a really nice way to keep the conversation flowing with friends. There are only a few things I would change. And if Mr Tofu is reading this review, I hope he'll consider these points constructive criticism.   First, the televisions are kind of weird. Always playing some tacky Korean music videos with the sound off... I think televisions generally give the place a tacky feel, but if you're going to have them then let us hear what we're watching. Better imo to take them out and just have some music at a low volume going.  Second, the lighting and atmosphere doesn't feel warm. It feels too bright... too much like a cafeteria and not really some place that feels warm and inviting. I think the place could really benefit from spending some money on an interior designer.   Finally, I think they should color code the tongs for placing and removing the meat on your grill. Maybe I'm being too much of a clean freak, but it seems to me you shouldn't be using the same tongs to remove the cooked food that just came into contact with raw pork. It would be nice if they had like a color-coded system that they explained to you when you sat down. Red tongs for placing on the grill, green tongs for picking it up and putting on your plate. Something like that... you can take precautions on your own and try to keep one set of tongs for the raw meat and another for the cooked meat. But it's way too easy to mix them up... and I fear that someone is going to get sick.  Overall... this place is a real hidden gem and I'm happy to have it here in Vegas. I'll be coming back over and over for the next several years and will be sharing the experience with a lot of my friends.",

I read the reviews on here and decided to go around 3pm to avoid rush time, we were the only ones besides another table in the restaurant so there was no problem with service; however, our server seemed a little spacy and forgot to re-light our grill after we asked a couple times when the flame went out.  We ordered short ribs which were tender and tasty, I also ordered squid which was okay but hey it's just plain squid so it's okay.  The ribeye was tender and I enjoyed the texture. You get to cook the food yourself so it's up to you how long you want to cook it so no waiting and waiting and waiting for it to come out. The sides went great with the meat as we had white rice, kimchi, salad, and some kind of clear sauce to dip the meat in which actually improved the taste, I should have asked what it is but I didn't bother. I would recommend coming early to avoid rush time as I did.",

    "text": "A La Carte menu: I've been to Tofu Hut plenty of times before and no other Korean place I've went to had tofu soup comparable to this place. Sometimes salty, but nonetheless distinctive. I usually order the Bulgogi combination and Short Rib combination which are about $13-14 each including soups and sides. For the price, the food is quite a bit and enough to get a group of three to four full which is great. I tend to finish up the sides too. Rice cake, noodles, spiced cucumbers, kimchi, beans sprouts-yummy.  Downsides?: Bulgogi was overcooked this time I went... not too much of a biggie because the short ribs were perfect. The biggie was customer service. When I asked one of the employees politely for a refill of a side, she walked right past me without acknowledging me, then returned later just taking the dish without saying anything or looking at me. She quickly came back with a refill but I found it rather rude not being acknowledged at all...as if I wasn't there. Not cool. Overall, service is inconsistent every time I head here. Depends on server of course, but everyone on Yelp knows I love friendly people and tip generously for it. For Tofu hut, I realized not to expect much from staff anymore.  I like eating here for quick fix Korean. If it wasn't for my affinity towards the soup here, I'd prefer the ambiance and experience at Soyo (located Rainbow Blvd/Warm Springs)",

But, for Vegas, this one might be the best!  I like Sura BBQ Buffet too, but too pricey...especially their dinner price.  Other places like Korea Garden BBQ House in Chinatown are just downright horrible.  My brother and I used to come often for the tofu soups years ago, and I always thought Tofu Hut was \"good\".  But now with their AYCE Korean BBQ for $16.99, it is really, really good...probably an \"A-\" in my book! (Heck the late night special price of $13.99 is even better!)  I love their meats especially the beef brisket and bulgogi!  My wife (She's Korean and I'm half Korean) likes the pork belly too.  The banchan side dishes...oh and I can't forget their delicious salad...are all pretty good too. But heck, I really want to eat mostly the meats along with a little rice and a little banchan...but definitely the meats are the MAIN focus!  The service is good too and I find the servers definitely more friendly than some other Asian restaurants.  Bottom line...check it out...you won't regret it and you can't beat it for the price and quality for a Las Vegas KBBQ.",

The prices here are pretty decent, which is probably why they're pretty popular for AYCE KBBQ. $16.99 normally with a late night special of $13.99, but the late night special price doesn't include steamed egg or kalbi, if you want either of those you'll have to pay the regular price.   They bring out the meats as you order and you can only order a max of 3 items per table. Which they have a limited selection of meats, brisket, beef tongue, tripe, pork belly, kalbi, bulgogi, spicy chicken, and a few others. They pick and cut the meats how they want to and bring it out, sometimes I've noticed as I order the same dish, usually brisket and beef tongue, the sizes either get smaller and smaller or the quality of the meat decreases as well.   Rice and salad are included, but I usually wouldn't recommend the rice unless you're getting marinated meat, because you'll fill up on it and eat less meat. =]   They have an al la carte menu which is decent, I usually get it if I'm going in for lunch or late night and just want some tofu soup. They have a variety of tofu soup all at the same priced, slightly more than $8 each. It's a good deal, you also get rice with it. Just don't dump all the rice in at once, otherwise the soup will disappear very quickly!  Oh also, they put the egg in right when they bring it to the table.   I've gotten the spicy chicken and bulgogi from the al la carte menu, don't really remember the pricing, but it wasn't too bad. A friend liked the al la carte menu better because it's cooked on a stove top so the meats retain more of their juices and she found it more flavorful.   Everything you order comes with some side dishes, which include kimchi, seaweed, this type of fish thing (sorry I forgot the name), korean panakes, jap che, and a few others.",

Service was ok but since it was busy it was hard to flag down the two servers when we needed things.   The AYCE is $18.30 per person with tax   I did see that they did have a special AYCE  price after 10pm for $13something",

    "text": "There is only one Korean BBQ place I go to here in Las Vegas that I really enjoy and it is Tofu Hut. The dumb question I asked, because this is a meat meat meat place, is why is it called Tofu Hut? Well, go in to the non-BBQ portion of the place and you will find out. The average price for AYCE during normal hours is $16.00 and  while late at night, the happy hour (10 PM - 3 AM) is priced at $13.99 which is fantastic.  I always come here with friends and the food is always so delicious. We usually get the beef brisket, beef short ribs and the beef tongue. They are very generous with their portions of meat and they always help you change out the grill when they can see smoke polluting our smiles of indulgence. Not only is the meat delicious, but they provide you with the pleasant company of numerous side dishes and this AMAZING salad that I could practically eat myself, allll by myyyyselllf.   Reviewing a place like this is somewhat tough, because you basically cook your own food. So no complaints on the meat being over or under cooked, that would be my fault if that were the case. I like the judge the place based on the quality of the meat and the cleanliness and this place, as far as I know, has always been really good with that. I've never looked at the meat and thought it wasn't fresh, because the meat is always fresh and marinated to perfection.  The one thing that does prevent this place from the all mighty five stars is the service. Sometimes, I feel as if I'm an inconvenience to the people there. I'm not very needy, but if my grill is full of char, I'm going to request a new grill. You can often see the groans and the impatience, sometimes I'm almost forced out of there because the place is small. But in all honesty, I won't stop coming back to this place. It stays with you... as in you smell of Korean BBQ for the rest of the day until your next shower; which for some us, isn't soon enough.",

Before the meat escapade, we had kimchi, rice, fish cakes, bean sprouts, etc. We had to turn our grill up when we noticed the meat was cooking slowly. We had brisket, ribeye, squid, beef tongue, and pork belly.  You can put the entire slab of meat on the grill, or cut it with meat shears and cook more of a variety.  I will say the pork belly was very easy to cook  that great sear to carmelize it, and was favorite.  We also had the bean soup which was good. The salad was the best part in my opinion, considering I'm not much of a meat eater.  The price was great for how much food you can eat (endless meats).  Servers were responsive, though you do have to engage them for the most part, though not unfriendly, as others have said--just don't expect to be catered to.  What you should expect, however, is to leave smelling like BBQ.",

But I mean, it was already delicious.   We totally went for the Korean Barbeque, and I can in no way speak to the quality of the tofu.  The restaurant was clean, smelled wonderful from the moment you walked in, and the staff was all courteous, prompt without being lingery, and polite, even to those of us at the table that had a fairly difficult time pronouncing some of the korean dishes.  Four of us had the all you can eat, beef shortribs, of which I ate an entire plate all on my fat little lonesome, beef tongue, and beef brisket. Because cows sliced as thinly as loose-leaf paper and then cooked on fire are delicious. I think we went through about 3 orders of each. We also had 2 steamed egg thingies, which were wonderful, and some sort of spicy-savory red bean condiment paste thing I didn't catch the name of.  Pros:  - The classic bite of salad-bite of rice- chunk of meat combo is just so salty-savory-umami wonderful, It's absolutely cravable. I've never had a preparation of the salad the way tofu hut does it, and it was awesome. - Beef tongue. - Clean restaurant, awesome wait staff - Really reasonable prices - I, the whitest person alive, was not offered a fork, since it was clear I had the chopstick thang down.   Cons: - The atmosphere came off a little bit on the cafeteria side, which is not my favorite, but...eh, also the least important thing to me.  - The proximity of tofu.  Verdict: I will totally be back, though probably not ever for anything related to tofu.",

The sides went together perfectly. We hardly had to ask for refills cuz they were totally on it. They even gave us our own water pitcher so we'd never run out.

I think they're just kept busy because of tradition. This is one of the oldest Korean tofu houses in Las Vegas, and people have come to recognize it.

Half of the restaurant have stovetop tables reserved for patrons having the AYCE korean barbecue, while the other half of the restaurant has tables for the tofu eating patrons.  Although the bbq smelled enticing, I was there for one reason and one reason only: sundubu.   I ordered my go-to: the mushroom sundubu.  The menu described it as having 3 different kinds of mushrooms, but I can guarantee that I only saw 1 type in there.  The enoki and the oyster mushrooms were no where to be seen.  And on top of that I ordered \"medium\" spice level, and there was no heat at all.  Nor was there any flavor.  I poured the entire kimchee side dish and some bulgogi into the soup in order to create an edible bowl.  Only after those measures, did I start to enjoy my sundubu.  However, it wasn't my original order.    My husband seemed to enjoy his kimchi sundubu, but the \"spicy\" level, tasted more \"medium\".  So be warned, that you may have to order a higher spice level just to get some heat.  The bulgogi was very flavorful, and the banchan was not my favorite. My kids, however, devoured the korean pancakes, although they are a lot thicker than I am used to.    And I don't understand why almost every korean restaurant that we dine at, there is only one server.  Poor guy is running around like a chicken with his head cut off.  He was trying his best to meet everyone's needs, but we had to wait a while for extra napkins, extra chopsticks after my son threw them on the floor, and water refills. And then we waited a while to pay our bill.",

They do have lunch too for only $14.99! There were about 10 different meats that you can choose from. We ordered sliced ribeye, beef tongue (totally not a fan of it), brisket (oh so tasty), and tripe (it was weird). We totally killed it!   The service was okay, kind of forgot our rice until we mentioned it again but then again 3 people working on a Friday night umm yea that should explain it.

We ordered the brisket, chicken, marinated ribeye, and the marinated pork belly. The brisket and chicken were not marinated so it tasted like brisket and regular chicken. The marinated ribeye was very sweet and the marinated pork belly a little salty with a small kick of heat. The dipping sauce was generally oil/salt/pepper yet nothing to brag about. The service was ok and the restaurant seemed clean. I went to pay the bill and we were charged $18.95/ adult and $9.50 for our 5 year old. The menu stated $16.99/ adult so I was a little disappointed.The salad was the best part of our meal, but I would not return for just the salad. I would recommend Korean Garden a block down the street. They have a less meat selections, but the cost is $15.99 for the \"Vegas\" and you can get extra selections for $19.99.",

Any way we arrived at 11:30PM for AYCE BBQ it's $13.99 from 11PM -5AM or you can pay full-price $16.99 (10AM-11PM) if you want the short ribs and steamed egg after 11.   We started with the short ribs, ribeye and marinated pork belly.  Right after we placed our order the sides came out.  The tofu, noddles dish and pancakes were my favorite, everything was great.  When the meat arrived the waiter helped us out by piling the ribeye all together because it cooks juicier and laid out a short rib and the pork belly.   We've never really worked the BBQ before and it must of looked like our first time because they kept coming back to us and moved around the stuff.  Basically its hotter on one side of the grill than the other.    The short ribs were very tasty however I was trying to keep some manners and not rip the meat off the bone lol!  Rib eye and marinated pork belly were also very good but since we didn't really move it around it kinda burned.  For our second order we ordered brisket and pork belly.  The waitress suggested the steamed egg since we were paying full price anyways.  I really thought ... ok I'll try its probably just going to be like an egg topping like with some Thai food.  The brisket came out and was a huge serving and fresh not frozen! the pork belly was equally good and by this time I actually kinda got the hang of cooking.    Now for the gold medal, the steamed egg came and she warned us it was going to be really hot.  I probably waited 2 min. when I took my first bite... OMG I've never had an egg like this before.  I mean I have a whole new outlook on eggs.  We have come to a theory that its an egg steamed with chicken stock with green onions.  Seriously my taste buds were dancing and singing!  The waitress  came back to make sure everything was good and told us to try the beef tongue and squid but we were sooo full.  After about an hour and a half we finished all the meat and some of the sides.  She came back with this Korean drink dessert that was very very sweet! As we paid she told us its only $4 for a pack for 50 at the Asian markets.  Our bill came to $36.60. Totally worth it.  Since we don't have a lot of experience with cooking Korean BBQ,  they get 5 stars from us because they were extremely  helpful and courteous.  The service really could not have been any better! I think we were humoring them while we were trying to cook but it was all in good fun. Our water was always full and all the sides were refilled when asked.  This is probably a place we'll be back during our late night eating binges.",

My wife and i ordered the beef soondubu spicy and chilled soba  noodles. Lets start off with the banchan.  The banchan was extremely meh....nothing special what so ever. The tofu soup came out first....first of all it wasnt spicy at all, and the soup lacked flavor, pretty bland. About 10 minutes later we received our chilled sona noodle dish. The dish was covered in lettuce, and was overpowered with vinegar.  The dish wasn't very good at all. All in all a very mediocre meal. I was alittle disappointed that the name tofu hut suggests that they specialize in tofu. Yet their tofu soup was absolutely forgettable. I for one wont be returning",

They have one for dinner after 11 pm, and one for lunch. $16.99 or $13.99 is way cheaper price than some other korean places. I wouldn't recommend the squid because it came as a whole piece and not flavored. You should get the beef flank or marinated beef - those are pretty good. comes with salad bowl. I got the seafood beef tofu soup - not that great. I had it extra-spciy. Basically mean they add more red pepper, but not spicy. And the soup had like clam shell pieces, so I get this random \"crunch\" sound when I bite. Their appetizers are probably one of the best, if not the best I have in vegas. seaweed, fish/tofu strip, soybean sprouts, kimchi, cucumber, onion pancake (best), clear noodle.",

    "text": "In the Bay Area, I noticed a surge of Korean Tofu restaurants popping up.  And those that had been around for awhile, it appeared that they were getting a new surge of customers.  I was damn curious to see what the hype was all about and with a restaurant named \"Tofu Hut\", I figure it would satisfy my curiosity.  We actually passed another Korean restaurant first, a new one complete with the \"Grand Opening\" sign up.  I figure we'd try out \"Tofu Hut\" since it had been in Vegas for awhile and has lasted.  Usually, it's a sign that the business must be doing alright, right?  Wrong.  So, my first mistake was assuming that because it had been in Vegas for awhile, it would be decent.  The second mistake I made was not checking Yelp first to see if anyone had anything about this restaurant.  If I had done this first, I would have seen TWO 1 star reviews with no other good reviews to counteract the two.  If I had done this research first, you would not have seen me eating here.  Walking in for an early Sunday evening dinner, our party of four chose the cooking table with the plan to cook some serious meat.  Instead, we ordered the Kimchee Beef Tofu Soup ($8.36), two orders of Short Ribs BBQ ($12.59 each), and a Kimchee Pot Stew ($8.95).  If you do want to do the table barbecue, it's a minimum two orders to do that.  They brought out a side salad for each person to start and then five banchan (side dishes) to share.  And yes, I said five.  I thought this was a joke - April Fools' Day, haha kind of joke.  No.  I know at some Korean restaurants they give out more banchan to the Koreans, so we even asked for more and they said that's all they had. I thought we were being gypped and looked over at the neighboring table of six Koreans to see if they got more than we did.  No, they did not.  Tofu Hut only gives out five banchan!  Blah!  They were this coleslaw concoction that I have never seen before, cabbage kimchee, fishcake, bean sprouts, and cucumbers.  I'm used to getting 5-10 banchans, you can imagine my shock and disappointment!  When the tofu soup and pot stew arrived, the waitress asked if she wanted her to crack a fresh egg in there.  Sure!  As she passed over my hot tofu soup, she knocked over the BF's water glass.  No big deal, she apologized and cleaned it up.  (I was just glad she didn't drop the hot soup too!)  I had my tofu \"spicy\" and it was more mild.  There wasn't much taste going on here and I was less than impressed.  I did like the hot stone burnt rice that comes out with my tofu soup though.  My friend's pot stew was more soup-like than she cared for as well.  The only thing really good was the Short Ribs.  We ended up ordering another plate because it was pretty good.  Everything else fell below par.    To close out our meal, the check came.  We asked if they had shikhye, which is a this cold beverage that is usually served at the end of the meal.  It's refreshing after a greasy meal and I'm used to getting this automatically after our meal concludes at Korean restaurants.  They told us they did not have this.  Oh my goodness.  Five banchans and no shikhye?!    Final bill: $70 including tip and tax.  This restaurant is sparse.  Lots of Koreans eating here, but perhaps I just have higher expectations and Tofu Hut doesn't cut it.",

    "text": "I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine and it is an all you can eat dine in restaurant but only on the left side. The prices range between $15-18 for the all you can eat. They do not have a menu on this side, they basically just have a list of the meats you can choose from and it is unlimited including the sides. I give the food four-stars, as the food is delicious. I love Korean food and sides! However, I need to give the service three-stars.   The first time I went there it was around 5pm, there was no line and we were seated fairly quickly. We had a lady serving us and she was nice but very hard to flag down. I enjoyed the food there especially the brisket and the sides. I was just not impressed by the service.   The second time we went there, we decided to go to dinner and we brought our friend with us. I made sure to arrive early to get us seats. The all you can eat side was pretty full so I stood by the sign that says, \"wait to be seated\". No one was behind me at the time so I did not mind waiting. However, another person arrived and spoke to one of the servers. He decided to seat them first which I'm sure would upset a few people. I spoke to him before he seated them and explained that I was clearly standing there first and he should not have sat them before me as I was waiting and was not with their party. My friends arrived soon after he seated that party of three I was not too happy about that. I had a good time otherwise, but I just feel that in order to get more people into the place, the service has to be just as good as the food. If you don't mind good food, but lousy service, you should try this place.",

I think that's a cool concept that allows you to cook your meat as rare or well done as you want.   The brisket was so fatty. I felt like I was chewing bubble gum, but the ribs were delicious. They also had this vending machine that gave you about 4 oz. of coffee for 50 cents. I don't even like coffee but I make it a priority to get the milk coffee everytime I come here.  The sides were pretty good. They gave us a large variety to choose from. I liked the tofu dish they served the best.   The customer service was at a bare minumum. The lady came around every once in awhile to refill our water cups but that was about it. She didn't even talk (or smile) while she did it. It was very robotic-like.  The food was very good but I've had better, so that's why I feel the three star rating is appropriate.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Korean BBQ - This review is on the Korean BBQ part of Tofu Hut where you get to cook your own meats and eat them.        - Minimum 2 - To get the AYCE, you have to have at least 2 people getting it.        - Quality - The quality fluctuates. When it's good, it's great. When it's not, it's not you get small pieces that look less than fresh. However, I've never gotten sick yet (cross fingers).        - Price - They're quite a bit cheaper than your average Korean BBQ place. **Price**        - $13.99 AYCE Lunch (Short ribs & Steamed Egg excluded)        - $16.99 AYCE Dinner **Ordered**        - Marinated Sliced Rib eye        - Brisket        - Beef Tongue        - Short Ribs        - Steamed Egg **Notes**        - Korean salad and side dishes are provided at the beginning of the meal.        - The rib eye and short ribs come marinated. They're quite flavorful, but I like to eat them alongside un-marinated meat.        - The brisket and beef tongue are un-marinated and you usually dip them in this sesame oil/salt concoction. If it tastes too plain and they didn't put enough salt, you can ask for more.        - The steamed egg, Korean salad, and side dishes make a nice non-meat compliment to the rest of the food.        - Sometimes the heat from the grill leans to one side of the table. If you're with one other person, then both of you can move to one side. If you have more, than someone's just screwed. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap Korean BBQ place or feel like rolling the dice. Their quality fluctuates so it's a gamble. At their best, it's better than the other Korean BBQ places.",

    "text": "There are plenty of choices to be had in this part of LV for good Korean food. Back when I lived here (pre-2009), TH was a regular lunch spot for a bunch of co-workers. Somehow, we managed to make the drive under the Desert Inn underpass from the east side....but it was so worth it - even with that blazing summer sun. In the winter, it was a real treat where you could come here after a long hike in the mountains or Red Rock to enjoy a nice warm bowl of their spicy tofu soup (sundubu). They have a limited bottled beer selection (i.e., Hite and the standard Bud, Miller types, etc), but it's there and makes a tasty compliment for your post outdoor excursions... ;-)  Ambience is bare bones. You might even miss this place b/c it's right across from the main drag of LV's \"Chinatown\" and right next to a tire store and just before Play It Again Sam. However, this place has been here for awhile and locals know it. Occasionally you might even see the owner from Ichiza's eating here as we did one time.  They have a setup for BBQ (grill, hood, etc) at select tables, but I never tried their other menu items, b/c...well, it just seemed like their specialty was the sundubu. And for that, I've never been disappointed. You basically have your pick of whatever you could possibly imagine to put into that piping hot stone bowl - vegetables, seafood, mushroom, beef, etc. They have it all - even for the vegetarians. They don't skimp on the pickled dishes either - we've gotten refills when asked and they always seem to give us something on the order of 6 choices. The soup comes out with a nice raw egg which is the way I prefer it. I'm not sure, but depending on the time you go, I've had my meal end with the nice cool barley tea. it's a bit inconsistent tho...so I'm not sure.  Either way, good quick service, an affordable lunch price (all under $10 per person for the sundubu) and great consistent food quality makes this an easy 4 star review. If you're feeling adventurous after your hot meal, head over to Play It Again Sam for a True \"local\" experience. :-P",

The food is ok.  They gave our brisket frozen once.  And one time, they gave the wrong meat.  We ate it anyway though.  Usually, I'll give a place slack for having good food.  This time, the food didn't make up for the service.  it was just ok to me.  If you're looking for a good AYCE KBBQ place, I suggest WooChe.  I'll only come back here if I'm having a late night craving.  They open late and the price is pretty good after 11.  Other than those reasons, I'd rather go elsewhere.  Lol.. ^_^",

The positives are that its well priced for a buffet and the selection of meats are diverse. You can order cow tongue if your heart so desires.  Overall, I'd rather pay $5 more to eat at a nicer/cleaner/fresher spot. My friends do enjoy eating here due to the price, so I'm sure I'll be suckered into coming back, but not because I want to.   Korean Garden and DJK are better options, although more expensive.",

Anyway, one night, me and my friends decided to go eat some tofu hut. The guy that was seating people told us,\"Sorry there are no seats\".. alright.. cool.. we dont mind waiting.. so we asked the guy how long the wait is. He responds in a tone where it sounded like he didnt want us eating there at all. He replied with, \"I dont knowwww.. uhhhh.. could be 2 hours .. i dont know i dont know\"...  Yeah, we were pretty pissed off, but ended up eating anyways. And guess what? It WASN'T a 2 hour wait. Other than that, I enjoyed my meal.  Overall, food is great.. and service could be a bit more friendlier. Minus one star for the customer service....",

Brisket was on point. The pork belly, which I am a big fan of, was looking pretty slim. Usually the pork belly is in thick crazy cuts. This time around, not so thick. We didn't get the usual seconds on the belly. So we stuck to the brisket.    There is some tough competition out there in AYCE Korean BBQ. Maybe this was an off day for The Hut.

It's located next to a car shop garage and some other smaller businesses across from the Chinatown strip mall, but it is nothing that is run down or hole in the wall. I am not aware of the peak hours at Tofu Hut, but I will tell you the restaurant is quite small in space and seating.  I am actually not too much into meat in general (sounds crazy for me even coming here, right?) but they have a wonderful vegetable buckwheat cold noodle dish that's extremely big and extremely filling. My friends ordered the awesome all you can eat Korean BBQ. This place has probably one of the best all you can eats near Chinatown: refillable salad bowls, tasty cuts of ribeye, beef, and chicken, and amongst other side dishes of kimchi and noodle you can order.  Giving this place a four because it's such a deal breaker for finding a good all you can eat with quality food to a cultural level other than the redundant buffets found in Vegas. I would just recommend getting to know the times that are the least busiest so you won't have to wait for the already limited seating they have.",

Don't get me wrong, I love my AYCE, however, a tummy full of alcohol doesn't sit well with a tummy full of food that is mass produced such as buffet food usually is.  Our cravings led us to tofu soup, and a Yelp search led us to Tofu Hut (in all honesty, we wanted to go to another place close by, but it's closed on Sundays).  Not going to lie, we were a bit weary of this place.  Knowing this place was an AYCE BBQ, we were a bit worried we'd come out smelling like BBQ, which would require more preparation for that night's festivities (a quick shower to wash away the BBQ smell).  Thankfully, they actually separate their BBQ side from the tofu side.  We were able to stay well away from the wafts of BBQ smells floating in the air.  The tofu soup was good, although, I should have probably not been so chicken and actually gotten at least medium instead of being a wuss and getting mild.  The spiciness would have definitely added more flavor and kick to the soup.  Not to say it wasn't good, it was.  I had the Beef and Seafood Soup, which made for a great blend of flavors.  It was also good know they didn't skimp on the fillings.  Had plenty of beef and seafood, as well as, of course, tofu.  Four stars, because it was a hot day in Vegas that day, and I was downing my glass of water like a beast.  After I flagged them down the first time for a refill, they definitely kept my glass full the rest of the meal.  Major plus points!!",

This place is a buffet and i say you order because you have to order the meat that you cook. Thats actually a pretty good thing because you know the food is kept at a good place and not left out for god knows how long like at a regular buffet.  The things you can order are basically all the favs of korean places.  Kalbi, sliced beef, chicken, squid, and pork belly.  There might be 2 others but i forgot what they were.  I paid a about 16 bucks which is actually a darn good price for how much i ate.  The side dishes and rice and everything is really all you can eat.  I would also add that idk where they get their meat from but its of really good quality. I would have goven this place a 5star rating but the only problem i had was that the service sucked.  I was really thirsty that day and the lady clearly had an attitude when it came to filling up my cup.  Like im sorry im thirsty but i cant help it.  Also they didnt check up on us as much as they should.  Idk if thats their strategy to make you wait for service so you just get full while waiting for them to come around and ask for more meat.  Mind you this place really isnt that big at all so there was no excuse not to come around to us within a reasonable amount of time.  This place probably only has about 10-15 tables.  All in all i would have rated this place five stars if it wasnt for the bad service we got. I would still go again tho because the food and price was well worth it.",

Service can be kind of slow but with the amount of guests, it's fairly reasonable. The quality of meats and foods is good enough to satisfy your Korean BBQ cravings! Love this place!",

I loved the selection of meats and the price not bad at all. $16.99 for all you can eat and special $13.99 for the late night all you can eat. The food tasted much better than other all you can eat Korean restaurants. The service was very fast and our table was ready with our ban chan and the grill already heated up. Love and coming back definitely.",

    "text": "yeah, no thanks. Never again. I came here a couple months ago to wait for 1 1/2 hours and STILL not be seated. We ended up going to Sura.  Meanwhile, people who signed in after me got seated because of the number in my party (6). Im sorry but seriously? How do you expect to run a place that has like 5 cooking tables (the rest are for a la carte, but no one wants that)... and not expect hungry-angry waiting customers?  Well, I forgave this incident and came back another time thinking it'd be different. Yeeeeaah, NO. Waited for almost 2 hours! We sat at an empty table and were luckily able to at least order drinks, but still! They had forgotten us!  After this I'm never coming back. Oh and when we finally got seated? HORRIBLE and SLOW (can i bold the word SLOW) service! It's no wonder they aren't able to turn their tables fast enough!",

Everything was flavorful and fresh. I am not Korean so I am not about to get all snobby about the sides, but in my opinion, they were all fine -- including the kimchi. I will be returning here when in the mood for a filling  dose of delicious meats for cheap.",

If it wasn't for the cheap price compared to the other AYCE in Vegas, I don't think I would visit here. And after my last visit, I probably won't dine here again. The food was not appetizing at all. Side dishes were disappointing and the only dipping sauce they offered was salt and olive oil. We got tired of just plain meats without seasoning and the only seasoned meats on their late night menu were spicy dishes. Even those had no flavor. Our water had gunk in it. Overall, wasn't even worth a discounted rate.",

There are a ton of Korea BBQ places in Vegas...but Tofu Hut has the combination of price and quality that is almost confounding.  Expect a wait no matter the time of day. They stop seating at 1am, but I would not show up later than 12:30 because if the line gets too long, they will close the sign up sheet. I still don't get why it's called Tofu Hut, but you're going for AYCE Korean BBQ option, and even though the price is cheaper for late night, I'd still get the kalbi which is a little more because the quality of the short ribs is excellent. Other favorites were the marinated sliced pork, marinated sliced ribeye, and boneless chicken thighs.  The only knock on this place is service, but the quality/quantity of food makes this place a mainstay in our list of late night cravings. For less than 20 dollars including tax/tip....just go.",

My party of 3 was waiting in line first on the list and then 2 korean guys just walked in and stole our seats.  I made a complaint and the host didn't do anything about it so I chewed them out myself. Told them to get off our table and wait like everyone else is. People that were waiting got pretty upset too. We always had to scout them to ask for refills and they always forget the straws. Other than that, food is good.",

The restaurants in Vegas Strip were mostly American (burgers, fries and steak) and Asian foods there were either pricey or taste awful. Tofu Hut became our choice and it proved to be the right decision. We ordered two tofu soups and it was hot and tasty!! Plus, the total price was under $20 (Almost the same price for one tofu soup when I was back in Boston) The service was OK. I also saw they have all you can eat BBQ for $16+tax. If you want to have BBQ, usually there's a time for waiting. I'll definitely come back again if I'm visiting Las Vegas!!",

    "text": "We have been coming here for years and I haven't been in a while which makes me kind of sad. We usually come here late like after 9. I've never been earlier probably because my boyfriend likes to get the cheaper price at $13.99 for AYCE instead of the $16.99 price. Same value just cheaper price. They do have a side where u can order menu items and then the other side of the restraunt has the built in grill on the table for grill your own KBBQ.   Service could be better if they had more people working which is why sometimes it takes a minute for them to check up on you but i usually ask for extra Banchan and am busy eating so I don't really need much once the meats have been delivered. What I love is the oil they give u to dip your meat in. Some kind of oil that has salt and pepper tastes so yummy when the meat is dipped in it then put it on your bowl of rice and eat it together. Yum ! Oh and the salad ...... The salad is so simple yet so delicious.  I must find out what kind of dressing they're making for this salad because I would love to make it at home.   Some of my fav meats to try ....   Pork Belly basically it's bacon. Who doesn't love bacon. Only bacon is cured and smoked. I just don't care for a lot of fat on my meat but my boyfriend handles that part. I just eat the meat and cook it extra crispy.   Short rib -  is always tender I cook it not to well done because I like it juicy.   Beef Tongue is also very good tastes like thin cut steak. I would have never tried but my boyfriend didn't let me know it was tongue and I've been a fan of it since. I'm not to fond if those exotic parts of the animal if you know what I mean. I will still try. Some I just don't prefer. But the tongue here is bomb!    Ribeye - Marinated beef almost like bulgogi   The great thing about grilling your own meats is you control how you like your meats cooked. Service could be better but I always come back & I still love you Tofu Hut !",

It goes perfect with the salad they serve and the sides they provide (noodles, kimchi, bean sprout, etc.)  I give this place 4 stars because of their amazing food but not the full 5, due to the times they lack service. There are times where they forget to refill our drinks or ask if we need more rice, and all that. One time when I was eating with friends one of the server's appeared to be having a bad day and it showed through her service with us. She never smiled and she rolled her eyes whenever we asked for things. Service in my experience doesn't lack all the time like this, there are great times and there are bad ones. However, it doesn't interfere with the delicious and affordable KBBQ that they offer.",

Well, they were right, and the story behind the name is they expanded their business and menu to now include lots of Korean meats.    This place was great. The servers were very attentive, the sides were tasty, and the price for AYCE BBQ was very reasonable.   We had a big table, so we got like 4 different meats to start...I like all of them, but the cow tongue was a tad \"organy\" to me.  My favorite was the prime rib steak cuts.   My only True disappointment is although they serve a chopped salad, they do not have lettuce leaves to wrap the food in.  This is the way I have always eaten it, so I was sad they did not have this option.  But due to the other positives, I still give this place a 5...and I would eat here again....I'll just bring my own head of lettuce.  BYOL ;)",

They brought six appetizers and steamed rice to our table. The appetizers consisted of tradition Korean dishes. Next we ordered the meat we wanted. You're allowed to order 4 entrees at a time and have 90 minutes to eat lol! The short ribs are delicious but a little hard to cut. The sliced rib-eye is also really good...those are my favorites!  They also have a regular dining side where you order regular entrees. My friend said this is a good option if you aren't that hungry since it is only one entree and you can take leftovers home.",

When these two are running the place then service is top notch.  I only come here for the very affordable all you can eat Korean BBQ.  Pick and choose what you prefer but I always stick with the brisket, short ribs, and marinated short ribs.    You'll get the sides automatically and rice but instead of rice I like to ask for the greens/salad.  Even though it gets really busy at night, these two-men duo gives you superb service.",

Service was fast and the server on this visit was very accommodating and tries to check on us to make sure we are having a good time but not to the point of being annoying.  We have just observed that every time we visit (like every 3-4 weeks gap) something had changed. For instance on this visit, taste of the salad, kimchi and bean paste soup were bland. It could be there cutting cost or the supplies they got were just not the same as before. Nevertheless, Tofu Hut is still the affordable, go-to Korean AYCE place.   Hopefully they can be consistent on their products' taste.",

    "text": "90 min - $16.99 per person, $5.99 for kids ages 3+, automatic 15% gratuity for parties of 4 or more.    Overall value in my opinion is good - this place is always packed - we managed to get in at about 6:00pm on a Sunday with only a couple people ahead of us which was great.  The service was good - the servers are not overly friendly (but you don't go here to make friends with your server anyway) but they are attentive and will get you whatever you want, just flag them down.  Meat - selection is a little limited but at this price point it's pretty good.  Their short ribs are boneless - marinade is good, not overly sweet.  The brisket is pretty typical of what you'd expect, the squid was good, pork belly is sliced very thin and the beef tongue was sliced super thin.  Of all things that stood out - it was the beef tripe/intestines - they're cleaned well and don't have a nasty aftertaste which was great.  No lettuce wraps/rice paper/radish paper, etc - just a bowl of shredded lettuce salad.  I really liked the salad dressing - just enough to cover but not overpowering.  The grills themselves are nice - the fats drain off to the bottom edges and it seems to cook pretty quick compared to other places I've been.  They don't seem to change them out during your meal though but it stayed clean enough to get through all of our cooking.  I did not see any dessert options.  They just have your typical banchan / kimchi side dishes.  If you are on a budget and/or are able to get in here without waiting forever - you should check it out.  Not the best Korean bbq in Vegas but possibly the best valued AYCE one!  Also there was mention of a late night special pricing but I did not see this anywhere - maybe they don't do it anymore.",

It came with a variety of sides, of Seaweed salad, Tofu, potato pancake, sticky rice, bean sprouts, kimchee and a couple other I wasn't sure of. I tried them all and enjoyed them all. Loved the beans sprouts! They had a sesame oil on them. Great flavor. The main dish of Kimchee Beef, which I ordered medium spicy, had plenty of tofu and kimchee. They offer an add a raw egg upon request, which I was a bit apprehensive about, but went ahead with it. Glad I did. It cooked into the dish by the time I was ready to get into it. Great spot!",

I get it all the time when I tell friends of this place, the usual \"yuck i don't like tofu, do they only serve that?\" And to answer the question NO! They have chicken, beef, pork, seafood and some soups.  The sliced Rib-Eye, the short ribs, the brisket and the beef tongue are all really good. I have also tried the chicken but after receiving a very salty batch one time I don't go for it any longer.  Half of the restaurant is for the all you can eat BBQ and the other half is for where people order already made plates of food. I personally think for the late busy hours, so that they don't have such a long wait, they should make the entire restaurant all you can eat.  The salad is the BEST!!! They toss some red flakes and powdery type thing in there and its just amazing!  Oh and when it gets extremely busy you don't receive the best service so you have to be basically jump in front of them to get their attention. But the food makes up for it in a way.",

Also, they are very kind with the amount of meat that they start you off with and through out the night when you ask for more! Usually, in a lot of AYCE restaurants, they will limit every time that you ask for more, but they do not. They give a good amount every time and we love it!   Customer Service: as returning customers, we've never ever had any complaints about their service. Always attentive, always helpful and always nice. They get us what we need and they're always checking on us!   The only thing I could ever say is that they do not have brisket sauce! Even when people say that you can ask for it, we have asked before and the answer ended up being no. But, that doesn't fail us enough to give them anything less than 5 stars.

Not even a dessert. The meat was low quality. All of the meat we ordered in the All-Day-Menu was extremely fatty. The grill already had fat all around the sides. The brisket was so thick and chewy and had so much fat. It honestly felt like I was only eating oil and fat. The kimchi... wasn't even CUT. They gave us a quarter of a cabbage. Had to cut the kimchi ourselves. The workers talked to themselves more than serving the customers. Overall terrible experience.   Don't go here. If you're looking for quality KBBQ experience go to Master Kim's KBBQ. The price there starts at $22.99, but I promise you it's worth the price. That restaurant comes with the option to order side dishes (I recommend corn cheese) and dessert! They also have the best brisket that slides down your throat. Juicy but not fatty... unlike Tofu Hut.",

    "text": "First off, to enjoy Tofu Hut or any cook your own meat Korean BBQ place you must know how to grill meat!!! You have to understand how different meats such as ribeye and chicken need to be cooked for different amounts of time to ensure that they are not overdone. Every time I come here I see people overcrowding their grills and leaving the meat on way too long. This is what causes the heavy smoke and flames that ruin the beautiful taste of your meat.   Tofu Hut is deserving of 5 stars based on the food/value ratio. My husband and I have been here quite a few times and will never get sick of this place. For $16.99 you get all you can eat meat, salad, rice, and banchan. For the meats my favorites would have to be the short ribs, pork belly, and the marinated chicken. Also, they recently added squid to their menu that you can either get plain or marinated in a spicy sauce. We had the plain squid and it was fresh and tasty, however I believe that the marinated would have made it even better. For the banchan you get kimchi, fish cakes, bean sprouts, marinated cucumbers, rice noodle salad, and Korean carrot and spinach pancakes. Give all of the banchan a try while you are waiting for you meat to cook. The kimchi and pancakes are amazing, however it is new kimchi so if you are looking for the old very fermented stuff this is not your place.   Tips for coming here: Be prepared to wait at least 30 mins as there is always a line. Just remember the saying \"good things come to those who wait\", and trust me its worth the wait! Grab one of the Cass or Kloud Korean beers to enjoy with your meal. Both are refreshing,full of flavor, and nicely priced for the large 22 oz bottles. The final tip I can give you is be polite to your servers. Some people on here complained that they experienced rude service during their time here. Please understand that the two ladies who serve here appear to speak little English, but both are extremely nice. A smile and a thank you goes along way here and doing so will show they you appreciate them keeping your BBQ full of meat.",

Hard to mess up the brisket, which is my favorite thing from the menu here. Second up is the beef tongue. And lastly would be the kalbi that is a little too sweet and sometimes black in some places (where you don't want to eat it).   The salad was amazing the first time I came here, but the second time they only had a cole slaw version with cabbage which wasn't nearly as good. Either they ran out of green lettuce, stopped romaine because of the recall a couple weeks back, or decided cabbage was cheaper.  The small side dishes are fairly good and we get multiples of certain ones. However the other meats not mentioned, and the soup/egg, are all lackluster or seem a little off, and are otherwise a waste of stomach space.   I've tried it twice and though I doubt I will be back again by choice, it's still the cheapest in town and for its price it is just right. The service is not bad either.",

The salad is filling and the BBQ comes at your request (unlike other places that are BBQ Nazis). Be prepared to wait as they are cheaper than the others, therefore, require a long waiting period.",

Beef Brisket, Rib Eye, Beef Ribs, Beef Tongue, and Tripe  The crew I hang with loves this place and I'm in agreement.  Was just there last night grubbing on tons of meat.  I don't really have a negative on this place.  I love the little side dishes of korean pancake, fish cake, kimchi, sesame seed sprouts etc etc.  I've always loved Korean food but it's usually so dang expensive that I save it as a special night.  If you go in the early hours of the morning, you are more likely to get some wait service that can assist you with the cooking, that is when my friend learned how best to do the experience and since she has, it's even kicked the experience up a notch.  I will continue to be a regular patron and sing praises on the all you can eat.  I think the little bottle of drinkable yogurt at the end is a nice touch.",

The people/manager who work here are basically protecting a customer who stole my sister's phone by not releasing a CCTV record of the incident. They only sent us a picture of a customer who sat at the waiting bench where phone was accidentally left and stolen. But we wanted to see the actual video before filing a police report because want to be sure that its that same exact customer who stole the phone. In short, we wanted to have a prima facie evidence. They made so many excuses such as \"we are very busy right now; we cannot look at the CCTV,\" \"We do not have the correct angle of the CCTV where you sat,\" as the employee/manager said even after sending a picture of a customer who just sat on the same spot where my sister left! The employee at TOFU HUT even said \"your phone stolen is not a major thing!\" Excuse me but thats not a very intelligent thing to say for an employee to justify a customer's personal belonging being not a major thing! Its just unacceptable, insensitive, and unethical way to deal with customers! How dare you? Its not just the cellphone itself but the memories, pictures, files and all other important information stored in it that could be lost forever! They don't care (unwilling to help) about their customer who was the victim but care so much about the customer who stole the phone! I don't know what core values this business has, but Im sure they don't matter at all! They failed to protect their customers and for that, we regret going here!",

They have kalbi, short ribs, squid, pork, chicken, and many different side dishes.   We waited about 20 minutes for a table. That was the first good sign. Their service was a bit disservicing to us and themselves. They need a bit of a better system, but what can I say? I'm in Chinatown. It's just that they kept going back and forth for one thing at a time, so it takes a while for you to get things some times, thus the one-star off.   They have a really good soup like a Mae Won Ton, that was really yummy. Definitely try every single thing on the item list and bring tons of friends. That's the best way!

We got the combination specials which included the side dishes (+unlimited refills of said side dishes). My go to side dishes: fish cakes and the pancakes (whatever that is, IT IS DELICIOUS). Here in SF I don't think we have those pancake things but they were BOMB.COM!! I could eat that everyday. I ordered the spicy chicken bbq. The tofu soup it comes with is really good - if you like it spicy it's not TOO spicy, but it's still good. Korean BBQ is probably my most favorite kind of food...

I've tried a lot of korean bbq places and by far,  tofu hut has the best house salad!

Avoid touching the menus because they are usually sticky from the oil splatter. Cook the meats properly, especially pork, and heat the tools used, to kill bacteria from raw food. Even after following these precautions I still get sick...  The food is mediocre, there aren't any great KBBQ places in Vegas so I can't really complain.",

You do have to sign in for all you can eat BBQ.   Once seated, the table came with little dishes of kimchee, bean sprouts, and other things I'm not sure of but we're delicious. They also provide you with steamed rice, salad, and water right away. We ordered the chicken breast, rib eye, short rib, and brisket. Of all four, I enjoyed the chicken breast. It's a bit spicy but deliciously seasoned. The rib eye was the runner-up for me.   I was a little disappointed in their brisket this time. Usually that's all I eat when I go there but this time it tasted different. It didn't really have seasoning or maybe it was the grill making it so bland. They may have changed their recipe or gotten this brisket from a different kind of cow or something because this is not the brisket I remember.   Despite the failed brisket, it was good. I do recommend wearing clothes you don't care about when going because when you walk out of there, you'll be smelling like a walking Tofu Hut. I also recommend going to this place in winter since the grills give off so much heat and will keep you warm during your dinner lol.   Will I come back? Probably. Will I have the brisket? Probably not.",

I think this place is pretty decent with a concise and solid menu. My absolute favorite thing to order in KBBQ is beef tongue so of course, I order that first. My friend and I savor every slice along with whatever else we had and order another. They bring it out and even just looking at them on the plate, it's obvious it was cut much, much thinner. I have a picture of a cooked slice from both our first and second orders that I will post :(.   Now, I get it- it's a business. I am pretty confident in my ability to devour beef tongue to the point where I question if a restaurant will make money off me. However, slicing meat thinner is not the way to secure a profit! \"Just order another,\" you might say. Well, I say thinner cut slices are not as scrumptious as a more hearty slice. Also, it makes it harder to cook on the darn grill. It will quickly MELT if you aren't gifted with the swiftness and grace of a grilling ninja. Therefore, I am sad.   Nevertheless, I did enjoy my dinner at Tofu Hut regardless of the sad beef tongue. We ordered almost all the other meats off the menu and they were good. I felt service was responsive and polite and there was almost always a waiter nearby if you needed anything. I would come back, but my quest to find a KBBQ place I absolutely love continues...",

    "text": "In my opinion it's one of the better Korean BBQ restaurants with a more economical value. Other places its $35 and up, this one it was $17 for all you can eat, but of course just like sushi, you better finish up what you order or they will charge you for whatever you didn't finish.   My favorite part of this restaurant is they have tv screens playing music videos of Korean Pop, so it feels like an upbeat atmosphere.   I case you've never had Korean bbq, the table will have built in grill and you can order many different meats that will be served to you raw and you can cook them on your grill to your liking. Now be aware you will be doing all the cooking yourself, the servers will not lay out the meat for you. It also comes along with different sides such as kimchi, rice, sweet potatoes, and other items i could not identify but still good.  Alcohol is provided, including Corona and some other brands known to Americans.",

    "text": "Since my last review, I've been here a couple times. I'm going to knock them down a star. This is mainly due to the quality of the food.  Many people like to come here because the all you can eat barbecue is the cheapest in town. It's 15.99 and it includes short rib and steamed egg. But recently, the food quality has gone down drastically.  First, let's talk about the kalbi, or marinated short ribs. The beef was average quality. And, it was way too soft. It lacked any sort of chew, which means it was marinated too long.   The spicy pork bbq was really disappointing as well. It had been overly marinated as well and we had been cooking it for a while, but it seemed like it was never done.  The ribeye was acceptable, and so were the pork belly slices, but really, is it that hard to mess it up? All your doing is slicing. What seems to be the issue is the marinades here.  The banchan is very disappointing here. The only highlight is the stir fried fish cakes, but it was average. The pancake and japchae are so bland here. The kimchi does not taste good. The only highlight was the salad.. just what I wanted to eat at an AYCE bbq (sarcasm).  The bean paste soup is so bland and flavorless, and the once good steamed egg tasted like an overly salted, watery mess.  The food, I'll give it 2 stars, but the price, I'll give it 4. The service here is good and fast. I would go here if my friends wanted to go, but on my own accord, I probably wouldn't be taking any out of towners here, no matter what the price was.",

There is a long wait time for the BBQ and almost an equally long wait time for food and service. There are only 2 servers and 1 bus person and the demand for service exceeds what they can supply.  Even though this is my first review for Tofu Hut, I've actually visit this KBBQ repeatedly over the past several years. They never had fast or stellar service, but this time was just too much.

That must mean something, considering there is nothing really special about this place. It's as simple as simplicity gets. This small AYCE Korean BBQ has enough choices to satisfy those Korean craving tastebuds. But on any given night be prepared to wait anywhere from a reasonable 30 minutes to a sometimes ridiculous 2 hour standby. It is pretty much a hit or miss, just expect the expected. After 10:00pm is a discounted price of $13.99 compared to the $16.99 regular price, which is still not bad.  Just know that the discounted price will not include short ribs and steamed egg. You can opt out those prices to get those menu items included.  This place has been on KTNV channel 13 news for Dirty Dining before, but I guess sometimes the dirtiest place taste good! (No pun intended but not saying that is a good status to acclaim). The times I have been here however were clean enough, but behind the kitchen only the prying eyes will know.   This place could improve on size, but I think renovating the place is out or question.  Again this place is not anything special, but a local hot spot amidst the Chinatown district and open late for those night owl cravers. I do recommend it though!",

    "text": "I have to say, ever since Tofu Hut reopened, the service and quality of food has improved a lot. The servers are very nice and they often make rounds around the tables to ask if you want water or more meat. It used be to painfully difficult to get the attention of servers here, but almost everything about Tofu Hut seems to be much improved.  So I have to admit, I'm not a fan of side dishes at any KBBQ place so I'll mainly just rate on meat quality, price, and service. Meat selection is pretty standard, you can get brisket, marinated ribeye, pork belly, chicken, and squid for the lunch price of I think $12.99. For dinner you pay $17.99 and can get short rib and steamed egg as additional choices. For KBBQ in Vegas that's the cheapest price I know of. So meat selection (and taste) is pretty good, price is good, and service is good. I'm giving it 4 stars though because I can't help but compare it to the KBBQ in LA which is the same quality for $11. But still, I think Tofu Hut is the best choice for KBBQ in Vegas for people not wanting to pay $20+ each.",

However, It was a huge let down today when the kalbi bbq we had were about 3 pieces of strip kalbi meat, just cut in tiny portions to fill out our hot plate.  The food was good. I loved their appetizers, despite the 'hit or miss' with customer service. I'm a loyal foodie. I always go back to places I like. Although, it was a good run. I have a lot of memories here at Tofu Hut. I came here with friends and family. I came here to celebrate my second pregnancy, I came here every week after my Chiropractor appointments. I came here during my third pregnancy and several times post-pregnancy at about 4 months.  I live on the other side of Town but I drive all the way out here for their food. Perhaps it's time or me to turn in my hat. Adios!",

Yes your thinking, tofu, all veggies right? Nope totally opposite. This hut is an all you can eat Korean BBQ joint. Yup, they have meat.   Always greeted when we walk in and on a busy day, a 5 min wait to get a grill table. They have 8 or 9 I believe, and on the other side of the restaurant, several tables for menu ordering. Haven't seen it yet because we come for the BBQ, and we'll have to try sometime.   What ordered: Marinated beef Thin sliced beef Pork belly Steamed egg Bean soup  90 minutes is what you get, and that's more than enough time to get that belly stuffed though. Everytime we ordered, our plates were stacked high. Maybe it's to keep from reordering so many times, but it's hella convenient. Meats are fresh, and marinated meats are flavourful. The pork belly are like thick slices if bacon. I mean, what can you ask for @ $17 a person. Beef, pork, chicken and a couple of seafood items. Not to mention all the side condiments like kimchi, salad, tofu, bean sprouts and seaweed salad.  Servers here are very attentive. No empty glasses or condiments. Plates cleared, and we were always checked up on. And when needed, our grill was changed on request. Compared to the higher end style KBB, I'd call this the Carl's Jr of BBQs. Go in, eat and get out and go.   Definitely the go to spot for that fast KBB crave.",

The restaurant was also divided by whether you want to BBQ or not.  I ordered the steamed egg this time which I'd never had before. It came out piping hot. And it was light and fluffy. I really enjoyed that, it pairs nicely with the seasoned meats. And after awhile if you dont eat it all right away, it deflates like a fallen cake.  We also tried the marinated steak this time which is thinly sliced and cooks fast like the spicy pork belly. My cousin thought it was dry so she was dipping it in the sesame oil salt mixture.

I was wondering yesterday what gives this place its charm while we had dinner there last night. The long list of kbbq that runs on Spring Mtn, this may be one of oldest spots that I know of. This place is a no frills, cozy spot with an excellent price point. The food isn't top notch but it's exactly what I expect every single visit. Food is 4/5 stars we love the brisket, short ribs and there mushroom tofu soup is freakish good. My partner enjoys the banchan and the savory salad that's included with the AYCE.  The restaurant is not big. Half of the place is divided between AYCE (with 7/8 tables only) the other side for a la carte. There likely will be a wait, even longer waits for peak dinner hours for AYCE.  A la cart side is usually always available to sit immediately. The service here is always good, they work efficiently and quickly to make sure your served quick and full and move along to the next.  Places like Tofu Hut, feel like a nice break from the glitzy kbbq. Sometimes your girl just wanna eat, and look bummy without the side eye.",

    "text": "I've been going to Tofu Hut for many years. They are the original korean BBQ on spring mountain, time to give some props.  Tofu Service and ambiance:  This is a small mom & pop korean BBQ resto.  Smaller in size vs. the current korean BBQ joints but the tables and grills are setup optimally.  Since they pack a lot of customers in a small area, it's going to be a little noisy. Two flat screens on the wall play K-pop music videos and random Korean shows.   This is a casual restaurant where you're here more for the food versus the ambiance/experience.They have tables with the BBQ grills as well as regular table.  If you don't get there before a wait, it's going to be awhile.Service is inconsistent but overall pretty good.  AYCE BBQ and Tofu Soup:  Lunch time stops here for the Tofu soup have been common for me, my favorite is the beef tofu soup.  They come out quick and you get a nice selection of ban chan/small side dishes with your soup along with a bowl of rice.  Priced at $9.23 gets you to $10 after tax...don't forget the tip.  The AYCE option offers pretty good value for the price at $16.99.  The AYCE meats are good quality and the orders come out with good quantity.  My go to's are the brisket, ribe eye and the ribs.  Tasty and they've never let me down.  I haven't done the a la carte option but if it's the same quality meats, stick with the AYCE.  This is a Spring Mountain Vegas classic as they were the only primary AYCE Korean BBQ option many years ago.   They are  holding their own against all the brand new Korean BBQ joints with the value they offer for their food.  This kept me coming years ago and I still stop by today.  Enjoy! =)",

They have all the traditional meats that you would expect as well as all the usual ban chan. Their interior is basic with no fancy decor but it worked for us. We went for the Korean BBQ!  My only complaint was the server(s) we're stretched too thin. We only saw one server and on occasion, the lady behind the counter would step out and mind the tables with him. We complained that our burner's  flames were too low and actually tried to fix it ourselves. Being the stove professionals we are, we managed to turn off the flames altogether! At that point our guy should have not only relit our stove but should have also turned it up. Alas, he did not. He just lit it again. We had to flag him down twice to fix it. Eventually he got the heat turned up and we were able to cook and pig out faster. In the end, we were still fat and happy.",

    "text": "$16.99 all you can eat korean BBQ! Need I say more?  We started with the brisket and had to get seconds. The pork belly is on the thinner side (would compare to about 3 bacon slices thick) but was very good. Marinated sliced rib eye was on the sweet side but was tender and was okay. They also had squid and short ribs but didnt get a chance to try them. The steamed egg was amazing!  You get six different sides and white rice to start. I like mixing the steamed egg with the white rice together. They provide oil, salt and pepper to season the meats.   We went on a friday night and was told it was an hour wait so we put our name down and come backn20 minutes later to see they already called us. So we put or name down and wait about 15 minutes and were seated. There is all all you can eat restaurants in this area and a new one that just opened up across from them. Tofu hut has better service and at half the price you can beat it!",

    "text": "I finally got to try the Tofu Hut that all the Las Vegas locals have been talking about. I hear the the place is usually busy at night and your whole party needs to be present before you are seated. Its small and packed but the food is good and the service is great. They are always checking on you, cleaning your table and bringing out more food. This is Korean BBQ so you will be cooking your meats on the grill in the middle of the table. And its a great way to try meats that you would usually shy away from. Great place to meet up with friends to talk and eat.  Service was good, as waters were refilled promptly. You can ask for a grill change, and they won't do it unless you ask most of the time. Newer KBBQ places will offer to do it, which is nice.  The pricing was really cheap for what you get too. Very good deal for sure. My favorite side dish had to be the chap chae noodles Korean cold noodles. I also loved the marinated rib eye and spicy pork. I can't get enough of those three items and its making me hungry right now thinking about it.  I can't wait to be back to try this place again when I'm in Vegas again.",

Yes, the options are smaller and limited but the quality of meats are definitely worth the repeated visit. The place is small with a few tables and even fewer grills so a wait time should be expected. But if you're looking for a pleasant KBBQ experience without killing your wallet, definitely check out this place.",

To my surprise, on a Friday night, we were able to get parking and be seated immediately.   The restaurant is not that big, there is a lot of room to move around. I did like the fact that I didn't feel like I was packed in like a can of sardines. It can get a bit loud if there are large groups. The wait staff is attentive and made sure to come check the table while they were passing.  They have AYCE for about ~$17.00  a person. Their AYCE is menu isn't extensive, but they do have the basics. We ordered Pork Belly, Sliced Ribeye and Soy Sauce Chicken Thigh. Plates of meat were piled in great quantity - just enough to get you going, but not so much that you were wasting food. Also, whatever the salad dressing was ... that was delicious! Probably the most greens I have eaten that week.  I wish they did have more selection on the menu, but I appreciate the fact that kept it simple. I wasn't staring at the menu and I was able to have a some great conversation with my friend.",

On this night, I decided to go with some friends, because we had just finished date night at some paint and wine thing. After three hours of drinking wine and painting, we were hungry. We had decided on Tofu Hut, because of their AYCE option. Also, starting at 10pm, the AYCE is cheaper than normal during the day. It was kind of busy, and we ended up waiting around 20-30 minutes. The old korean ladies are never very pleasant or nice, they never smile. Whenever we ordered meat or food, they would give us a blank stare and walk off. Also, the salad was so bland and tasteless. Part of the korean BBQ experience is eating the yummy salad that comes with it! The salad had no flavor and it was really dry. It felt as if we were eating bunny food - ugh. Next, our grill was burning so much that the bottom started to burn. We thought that my boyfriend's pants were on fire at first and started to freak out. The bottom part of the grill had overheated or something, and there was so much smoke and it smelled of gas. We thought that it was going to blow up - might think im overexaggerating, but for ten seconds or so, we did. The old korean lady rushed over, took off our grill, then dumped ice on everything. After this, we all lost our appetite and did not want to eat anymore. We had asked for our check, and not once, did they apologize for what happened or even give us some type of discount for us not even finishing our food. NEVER coming here again",

    "text": "This place was my first experience with Korean BBQ. Loved it!!  My husband really wanted to eat Korean BBQ, but I was hesitant since I never had it before. After reading reviews on Yelp, he decided this was the place to try. The place is small, but it's not too busy in the early evening so waiting isn't an issue. We went at 5pm and at one point we were the only people in the restaurant. It got busy around 6pm.   The food was good; loved the sliced rib eye, but my favorite out of everything was the salad!! OmGosh! The dressing is to die for, I put a little rice in the salad which made it that much more delicious.   The service is sloooooooooooooowwwwwww. There are only one or two servers for the entire restaurant, but since the place is small and isn't too busy before 6pm, you should get okay service. But at busy dinner time, I'm sure it's hard to get your needs taken care of.... that's just the vibe I got from that place.    Overall experience was good and the food is delicious.  I will go back!",

However, there is always a line (half the store is reserved for the non-korean bbq customers, of which we saw NONE) because the space is used inefficiently.  Almost all of the meats were very bland, until we added this oil concoction that was already at the table.  No server offered us any advice on using the oil, nor did they even notice our oven wasn't lit when we had meat on it, until we said something.  Very inattentive servers, most didn't seem to speak or understand English.  Even the salad that comes with the all you can eat was very bland.  And then I find out they charge an automatic gratuity on parties of only 4 or more.  And guess what, the tip is added ON TOP OF the total AFTER tax.  That fact is what pushed me over the edge.  It's one thing to charge gratuity on such a small group, then to have to pay it for poor service, and then to find out it was charged IN ADDITION TO the taxed amount?!?! Very uncool and unfair.  Like I said, I wouldn't go back.  BTW, we thought Korean BBQ meant the bone -in short ribs (Kalbi).  Apparently even the meat called \"short ribs\" on the all you can eat menu, is NOT that.  It is instead a fairly bland-tasting meat with no bones.",

You can order by entree or if your feeling adventurous you can cook your own meat. Like most people we want the food to arrive cooked. I ordered the bulgogi and short rib both dishes were amazing. Bulgogi is my favorite Korean dish. If you never had it, it's shredded like beef seasoned with Korean seasonings. Our entrees came with 5 or so side dishes like pickled tofu, beansprouts, kimchee and other goodies.",

    "text": "$14.99 ALL YOU CAN EAT KBBQ and I'm a semi - Vegetarian..   So I had the Vegetable Tofu Soup. Extra SPICY!  Soup base and spice level is perfect! A bit spicy but they don't make it spicier by adding Chopped Jalepenos like some other tofu houses.   It's Bold and has a great kick.  The sides were great too, kimchi had a sweet tang to it, this pancake thing is tasty with the dipping sauce.  Food is a 4 to 5 rating.  I seldom give a 5 rating even if the food is really good.  The service has to compliment the whole experience.  This guy seems like a manager or owner, but he is like a 1 man team. Does the seating, register, serving and all that.  He left a water pitcher at our table because we were 5 hungry and thirsty people. He always came and topped off our water anyways.  Came  by multiple times to ask if we needed more KBBQ and my friends were sooo stuffed. I was very happy with my tofu soup.  And this guy even came out and asked if I wanted the soup base cooked a different way to omit the beef broth.  As he probably assumed im a full vegetarian, but I said no it's ok, just make it the standard way and I really appreciated him taking the extra mile to make sure food is up to par for the customer.  Will be back soon with all my so cal friends since they all like KBBQ!",

    "text": "It seems to me, that I always run into bad service in Chinatown.  Is it the culture, or are they not happy to be there?    I really, really, really LOVE this place, but the one thing that kills me is the service.  A group of our friends sat down and waited for the waitress to come take our order.  I kept looking at her to come over, but she would always brush it off and go back to whatever she was doing.  It was until she finally decided to refill the other people's table with water, did I get her attention.    Things to order: - Beef Tongue - on a good day, you can get the really thin big ones. Fry it to medium, and it's nice and soft.  MMmm, dip it with the oil they offer you.  It intensifies the flavor!  - Pork belly - I don't know what it is, maybe it's the oil that gives it more flavor but I can't help but keep eating it!  - Beef bugolgi - MMmm....on a good day, you could get it really marinated. Mmmm! and boy it is good!  - Steamed Egg - I don't know what this does, but it goes great when you eat it with the beef tongue.  The flavors just ooze out like crazy!  - Salad - Ohhhhhhh man, I don't know what's in this salad but it's soooo addicting! It's like sweet, salty, and crunchy! My kind of mix!  They used to offer yogurt at the end of the meal, but they don't anymore.  If you're coming here, do all you can eat.  It's not worth it if you don't.",

    "text": "Ahh.. Tofu Hut.   This place most often comes to mind when finished drinking and partying on the strip, mainly XS, Tryst or Surrender nightclub, since it's right down the street. That being said, my most recent visits here have only been during these late night hours (open until 3am), so my review is based among these parameters.   With a name like Tofu Hut, you would imagine that this place would be a vegetarians' Shangri-la. Well, it used to be when it first opened about 5 or 6 years ago, serving mainly piping hot, Korean spicy tofu dishes. It seems now as their main focus has shifted towards catering towards the AYCE crowd, as 9 out of 10 times, diners are grilling meat on the table. This doesn't bother me much, as I'm an avid carnivore, but I understand how it can bother some.   The AYCE pricing during it's special hours is set at about $13.99 per person, but excludes certain items such as Kalbi and certain side dishes, which are available at an increased $16.99. The banchan (side dishes), are of your average bunch and are of average quality. The meats are also of average quality. My only gripe of this place is their kimchi is of the \"just-made\" type, as I prefer my kimchi aged and sour. They do still serve their full-menu at night, and the spicy tofu soups never fail, neither does the charred rice bowl at the end (Noo-roong-jee).  The service can be hit or miss sometimes, depending on when you go. Usually, if you're there after midnight, there is only one server working, so if there are several tables being serviced, it is a tad frustrating to wave them down if you're in need of something.   Regardless, Tofu Hut is a good place to go if you're in the mood for some tofu soups, crave Korean at wee hours in the morning, or if you want to fill-up on Korean BBQ for a very reasonable price.",

    "text": "my family used to LOVE coming to Tofu Hut. Every birthday dinner, special occasion, etc. For a long time, the staff knew us and remembered us. Then things changed.   Before things changed (it's been at least 2 years), I would have given this place 5 stars. Now, I give it two.   I haven't eaten here probably in at least 2 or 2.5 years, so things may have changed since then.   My husband and I went out to eat one night and decided on Tofu Hut. We arrived, waited 5 minutes to be seated (with no reason as it was not busy), waited another 5 minutes to get water and have our drink order taken. Oh, and they didn't give us menu's, either. Good thing we already knew what we wanted and didn't need them. We placed out order when we ordered drinks. The drinks came when my husband's bulgogi came to the table. There was another table that was seated after us who had already received their food - about 5 - 10 minutes before Chris' food came out (yet AFTER we ordered), the other table ordered kalbi, which is also what I ordered. When Chris' food came out, my food did not come out. A couple minutes later, the other table received their food. I told Chris not to wait for me to eat as his food would get cold. We were not checked on at all.   After about 10 minutes, the waitress brought ANOTHER plate of kalbi to the other table and looked very concerned that they already had one in front of them. She did NOT bring my food. Instead, she went into the kitchen where 5 staff were talking over why there was an extra plate, which I am sure they were assuming was an order made twice. They packed the food and offered it to the other table, NO CHARGE!   Chris finished his food before any staff ever came to check on our table. I had still not received my order. I was furious! Apparently, though, our waitress remembered my order and put it in before her co-worker (notice, NOT our original waitress) passed by to check on her table next to us. I commented to the woman that I would not be paying my bill, to which she was very concerned. The manager came to ask me why and I explained the situation. Rather than apologize and offer any sort of acknowledgment of their mistake, the manager became angry with me and insisted I pay my bill because my food was almost ready. ALMOST READY?? At this point, I had been waiting NEARLY AN HOUR!   We paid our check, though I was tempted to simply pay for Chris' and walk out. We wrote a note for points of improvement and considered that our tip. We have not been back since.   Note, this was long enough ago that they did not have an all you can eat option, if that says anything about the timeframe.",

    "text": "Been here a few times now. All but one visit was for the AYCE, grill it yourself korean BBQ. It's not a real fancy place and not too big, so yes, sometimes there can be a wait when it's busy. Last time, we had to pass on Tofu Hut since it was full and some people were still waiting. You will leave there smelling like a korean restaurant unless you avoid the grill, not to say that's a bad thing!(Most of the time) Service for the most part is decent. Like some of the previous reviews noted the AYCE is $16.99. $12.99 after 10pm unless you want to order kalbi & steamed eggs I believe? A medley of korean side dishes and rice are served with your meal. Instead of the traditional green leaf lettuce to make wraps they have an unusual but tasty twist. A salad of shredded lettuce with a vinaigrette composed of soy sauce, sesame, chili flakes and probably a few other seasonings. The only real knock for I is that they have no steak like a tri-tip found at some BBQs, but that's more a personal preference and tends to be usually a dinner option if it's available. I tend to favor spicy pork & steak when I frequent korean BBQs. Can't really vouch for their non-AYCE portion of the menu but overall it's a decent place to get your korean fix.",

    "text": "Love Tofu Hut and always have. It's so good that I haven't bothered checking out any other jigae places around Spring Mountain. The location is fairly easy to get to (right off of the freeway) and it is close to anything Chinatown that you'd want to go to after - groceries, boba, Karaoke.   I always order the Tofu soup medium and it is delicious. Very flavorful, and filling, too, since it comes with banchan and rice. I've been there with others, however, that order the ayce and it is always great as well (I manage to sneak a few bites when they aren't looking). The best part has to be the cabbage mix salad that comes with the ayce. You're supposed to eat it with the meat and it is SO GOOD!! The ayce servings are big, and they require a minimum of two people ordering to get it, because otherwise, you'd get full off of one serving. It's best to go after 11pm when the prices change to get the best value.   My only complaint would be the service. I don't know if management changed or what, but my favorite people there weren't working the last few times I've been, and honestly, they were better than who works there now. They also seemed to get rid of \"stone-pot\" rice, which is sad because it was almost better than the jigae itself.   If you're in the mood for Korean, you definitely have to check this place out. It is my spot -  I try to go at least once a month. It is cheap, satisfying, and authentic. Make sure to come on an empty stomach!",

    "text": "Everytime I go to this place, I come hungry and leave happy. Not only is it the cheapest AYCE KBBQ that I know of in town, it also boasts of great quality meat (90% of the time).  My girlfriend and I get the following each time we go to this place: 1. Ribeye 2. Brisket 3. Pork belly 4. Short ribs* 5. Steamed egg*  *We only get these if we go before 11pm, since they charge you 16.99 instead of 13.99 if you get these items after 11pm.  The meats are almost always fresh, the brisket always has that bright red color, and of course it tastes great!  One thing that really made me a fan of this place was when we ate here one afternoon, the server actually taught us the correct order of cooking the meats. She said that you cook the non-marinated meats first before you cook the marinated ones. Being non-Korean, that was a very useful piece of information that she gave us, and it changed the way we ate KBBQ since then.  The thing I really don't like about this place is that it gets really packed during the weekends. They only have so many tables for AYCE BBQ, so the wait can be very long and gruesome (especially since you have to come hungry or else your dinner won't be worth the price). On our last visit here, they told us there was at least an hour wait, even though the two long tables were open, because they had a party of 20 coming in. We were starving, so we decided to get out of there and try out the neighboring KBBQ place. *Disappointed at Tofu Hut*  Another thing that I'm not a fan of is the service when it gets really busy. A few times, I had to practically hold my glass up in the air just so I could get a drink refill. They rarely ever come to check on you unless you signal them to do so, which makes it so hard to order the great meats and banchan that they offer. Speaking of banchan, their fishcakes and pancakes are soooo yummy. They're the best I've had anywhere.  Overall, I've been to this place enough times for Yelp to call me a regular, so I must really like, maybe even love the place.",

    "text": "About a year ago, there was a line out the door at Pho Kim Long across the street and I thought, \"Well, why don't we try something new?  How about that Tofu Hut place across the street with the all you can eat? How bad can it be?\"  Thankfully, the experience wasn't bad at all and I've been back a number of times since then.  (Note: This was also my first  Korean BBQ experience.  Thank you, Tofu Hut for being open super late to offer this!)  This is on the cheaper/lower end of the Korean BBQ spectrum that Spring Mountain offers, (IMO the higher end being Honey Pig, but that's another review altogether.) Their all you can eat specials really do it here with AYCE (13.99).  Tons of decent food with about 12 choices available of meat to cook, about eight side dishes, salad, a pretty rockin' tofu soup, and the whole thinly sliced meat combo.    My only complaint is that there is no AYCE for one person, you need to have at least two.  :(  The staff here, as one review stated, is always flustered because they get huge groups of loud crowds that show up half drunk and the place ends up mobbed and they're unfortunately under-staffed.  The staff here is friendly and I get a kick out of the Korean programs they show on the television, which are usually karaoke or K-reality programs.    If you go at night, particularly Friday or Saturday night, this is a hot spot for after-the-club crowd around 1/2/3AM.  So if you're looking for a quiet dinner, I don't recommend it on those particular nights.  My current favorite thing there is their tofu dumpling soup; spicy tofu soup with some hot dumplings simmering away in there.  Their spiciness level is pretty good, although I could do with a PINCH more for medium.    I also recommend their bibimbap in the clay bowl as that sucker stays hot for quite some time and you can take your time.",

    "text": "Compared to most KBBQs here in town, the variety and setting does it for me at Tofu Hut. I stumbled on it after a get together with some friends after our first semester of radiology school ended. It was my first KBBQ outside of California and after trying the others like Woo Che, Korean Garden and Kimchi Korean BBQ on the strip, Tofu Hut satisfies my palette and leaves me with a pleasurable stomach ache (from being soo full)! ;). Each and everytime I've come to this place, I'm with a huge group. Now, this place isn't super big but the staff, especially Rachel, is very accommodating and helpful. I'm not talking about groups of 6 or 8-- I mean groups of 12 and 15!  If you've been there already, you know what I mean.  Most of the time, we visit this haven of BBQ late at night and go for the 13.99 special of AYCE. Aside from AYCE, they do have an ala carte menu as well. Their side dishes and salad are a bonus to the festive and colorful flavor of Korean cuisine.  My favorite is the pancake.  The pancake is a mix of vegetables fried with batter usually served warm.  The starchy texture brings more of a soft and chewy feel to the crunchy bunch of little appetizers they bring to you.  If you come a little earlier in the evening, you can order steamed egg that I like to mix my rice with! A twist for the Asian folks or anyone who likes fried rice. What can I say? I work with what I got to make it the best! Haha! And now for the meat:  Brisket-- It's the most popular choice from the AYCE menu! The thin slices are easy and quick to cook and serve. They seem to burn really quick if you leave them on the grill for a minute longer as soon as they're browned.  Add a bit of soy sauce or lemon while it's on the grill for extra flavor! ;)  Ribeye (bulgogi) -- The meatier of the meats!  My personal favorite from the meat department.  The ribeye is very tender and takes a bit longer to cook. The flavor is exceptional and I suggest adding a bit more to the  majority of your choice of meat.  You can also order some garlic slices on the side that you can brown on the edges of grill! BOMB!  Marinated Chicken-- My least favorite. It takes a while to cook and you can't eat chicken when it looks like a vampire bit into it's neck. Unlike the red mea of the meat family, the chicken isn't as flavorful but if you like chicken with a bit of a spice to it, take the patience to cook it off to the side and get back to it when you can because it does have kick!  Beef tongue-- I was very skeptical about this one at first but after taking a chance to try it, it's really flavorful. It looks like the brisket so if you are only comfortable with having your own tongue in your mouth, ask your friends what's what before you start shoveling it into your face! ;). Burns quick, so pull it off the grill fast and enjoy!  Squid-- you have to be with someone who knows how to cook this right. if you aren't and you decide to be Mr. Iron Chef, just know that if you over cook it, you'll feel like Fido at home chewing on rubber! Add some vinegar and hot sauce with some garlic chips and you're set!  Pork belly-- Looks like a big slab of bacon and it tastes pretty much the same. I like to cook this one extra crispy like I do my bacon! Add some sesame oil (the stuff in the tiny dish with salt in it) for extra MM MM flavor!  Note: If you aren't a radish fan, don't eat the square vegetable in the reddish sauce, that's called daikon. But I always suggest trying everything once. Other yelpers will appreciate you taking one for the team! Oh, and if you decide to take your date here, give them a courtesy reminder that whichever car you decide to take will smell like BBQ for a few days! Hahaha ;) Happy eating!",

    "text": "Well what can I say about this place.... Its not that bad. But not worth going again...  The food was alright but the service could be a lot better... At most kbbq joints, I never had to ask for a bowl of rice to go with the meat I cook. They did not replace the grill until we had to pull someone aside (which is hard to do) just to do it. Whenever my husband wanted to ask for something they walk by as if there were no hands raised over anything. Now I'm not going to pull out no race card (even though we were the only *cough* *black* people there in the entire restaurant) but everyone else seemed to have been taken care of more than we were. (Sigh) it doesn't matter... I won't dwell on that.  Overall, the food was good but it wasn't ALL THAT. Soju and beer was great! I would prefer to spend my money elsewhere for Kbbq... Or I wouldn't mind going again if they would have better service....",

    "text": "First time here for kbbq. They have a sign in sheet. SIGN IT and pay attention when they call you or you'll lose your table. There are only about 10 tables that actually have grill.  Mind the fact they set the table for the size of your party before seating you. Including all the sides before you order. After ordering I quickly, I figured out our grill was a little bit below the bar. It took probably about a good twenty minutes before it was really cooking the meat (It was set on three flames which is the highest besides maxing it out, so it really was just a terrible grill). I was sadly, missing that first great sizzle as you're setting your meat out to cook. Once we got the grill fired up and hot, everything was easy and the service was excellent. They check on you often and bring everything in a timely manner. One miss is that once the grill side filled up, it becomes very hot and the humidity is very noticeable, even with the vents on. I personally think their vents could be stronger. Considering I had a lot of bbq meat facials during the cooking process. I enjoyed what we ordered but wasn't blown away from anything. Great place for a quick fix but there are better places out there.",

Its pretty hard to have a bad tofu soup, i mean most of the time, the general tofu palces are just average, not too good but not too bad, its something you can tolerate. but man, this place has the worst EVER, how do you mess up on tofu soup? AND you are called Tofu HUT?!!?!?  I stumbled across this place because my usual resturant, Mr.Tofu, was closed already, i was really in the mood for tofu and notice that accorss the street was Tofu Hut. So i thought hey, perfect! WHAT A MISTAKE!!!  I think the only reason people come here is for the BBQ and because it opens late.  There is no way people come here to have the tofu soup, its so tasteless and suprisingly DRY...  Do not recommand, stay way, go accross the street to Mr. Tofu! you won't regret it!",

The food is great, the pork belly is too fatty, more fat than meat. The salad is really good, and they give you 6 banchan as many as you can eat. Lol. I think $16.99 is a good deal considering the amount of food that you get. The short ribs are yummy and the ribeye are good but not the best quality of meat. You get what you paid for.

The short rib is well worth the additional charge, and with the tab for my party of 3 closing under $54, the reasonable prices cannot be matched either. If you are going for the AYCE, I suggest arriving early, as there was a bit of a wait. The wait, however, was well worth it and I will certainly recommend tofu hut as a legitimate establishment to get your Korean BBQ fix.",

Usually this isn't a bad deal unless the meat is poor quality and very fatty ( which it is here ) and now you just got ripped off for how expensive it is. They will up charge you for any left over food. The grill is so weak even on the highest setting that the meat cooks so slow. I'm pretty sure this is a tactic for them because you get full before half the meat is finished cooking. The service isn't that great either. They don't cut your meat for you and check up if you need anything. The sides here are really gross the bean sprouts tasted expired. Checking this place on my list as a do not eat here. Save your time and money this place is not worth it!!!!",

Make sure u ask for your brisket and beef tongue a thicker cut so it doesn't fall apart when u pull it off the grill. The service is really really bad, but the food compensates for it. I recommend the brisket, bulgolgi, and spicy pork belly. All the sides are wonderful, the best is the veggie pancake. Don't forget the dipping sauce for the meats! It's sesame oil with salt and pepper-- so good. This is your typical spring mountain restaurant. Yes, it looks really sketchy, no you have no idea what you're ordering, but it's so wonderful.

Order it spicy (4 or 5) and it's plenty flavorful, even with a water base.    We also got some japchae (the yam noodles) with veggies, which was a greasy pile of goodness, and some questionable banchan.... never can confirm for sure if the kimchee has fish or not.  Anyway, one of the sides was delish (the pancake), the other vegan ones were just OK.  Love the little salad with a simple dressing, wish we'd gotten a giant bowl of that.    All in all, this will be my go-to for tofu soup on a dreary day.  Just beware hidden fish!",

They never came to refill our drinks, refill our meat, or our sides. All you can eat- yeah right! :(  The staff also sat up by the very loud TV the whole time and ignored pretty much any one who didn't need to be seated. They also took 20 min to give us the check. They asked the table next to us to \"hurry up, people need their table,\" which was pretty rude! The bathrooms were a disaster which makes me wonder what the kitchen/fridge looks like..

(we asked the server what the peanut sauce was called, & she just handed it to us, smiled, & nod her head yes, lol)  For 4 people, we ordered: 1 plate of brisket thin slices,  1 plate of ribeye thick slices,  2 slices of thick cut bacon (belly fat),  & 1 plate of short ribs,  (we order a bit more after thehehe)  I also recommend the steam eggs, just cause you can mix it up w/ your bowl of rice like the taste of fried rice ;D  Now that's a mouth full!!!

I've never tried their regular menu, cus we always come here for the AYCE.  They have like serveral types of meat to choose from. Such as; bulgogie, pork belly, marinated chicken, beef.. They even have steamed egg which was different for me. To me, the best thing here.. actually two.. I'd say is the salad and their awesome coffee machine.

    "text": "Located across the street from Chinatown Mall, I first found this place cruising for late night asian food. I was delighted in finding a cheap all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place in Vegas. That was 2 years ago.  I went back to Tofu Hut over the weekend, after walking around all day at CES, I was starving (I refused to buy LV Convention food). I hopped on a bus to Tofu Hut salivating. When I got there, it seemed nothing had changed.  Granted, I was not there on in the middle of the night (the price is cheaper than dinner), but I noticed the price had gone up a bit since I've been there. The cost of food has gone up so this was expected. We ordered the marinated sliced ribeye, the brisket, marinated pork belly, and shortribs.  The mariniated sliced ribeye was tasty, but lacking in quality. The brisket was super thin so it cooked fast. The marinated pork belly was a little spicy and delicious, but we got over it fairly quickly. Very fatty, but that's what pork belly is all about!  The short ribs were decent, a bit chewy, although I was quite full from the other meats, sides, and beer. And Soju. How could I forget the Soju? I was full and drunk at that point.  The sides were not memorable (except the big bowl of salad, which I confiscated for myself), and the service was ok. There seemed to be only one waitress running around the entire place.  I have to say, while this isn't the best or cheapest Korean BBQ, it is a decent place to enjoy a meal with friends a little off the strip.",

We tried the brisket, marinated ribeye, and short ribs. The brisket was my favorite even though the cut of meats were uneven. Some perfectly thin, but not too thin. Other a little thick, so even though the meat was grilled, it was chewy. The ribeye and short ribs were okay. They're on the sweet side, so I liked cutting through the sweetness with a bit of kimchi. My least favorite was the short ribs. Too sweet and not the best meat I've ever had. For the price of all the food though plus like 5-6 sides, $16.99 is a price you just can't beat. Oh and definitely get that salad. Tasty stuff man. People are right when they say the salad is really good. Moving onto the service however, I just really felt bad for the older woman serving us. She was literally serving the entire restaurant. There were two other workers that I saw who would clean up dishes and man the cash register, but other than that, the older woman was taking care of the entire restaurant. No wonder the service was bad and slow.  It was a busy night even at 10:00pm, so be prepared to wait. In all, price is good for the food you get, but be prepared to wait and also have somewhat slow service.",

However, when we do eat here it's amazingggggggg! I LOVE the green salad they bring plus all the sides.  It is the best Korean bbq in town that I have tried!  Meats are delicious! All you can eat is fine, I like it for all the sides you get.  I don't have a need for all you can eat but it is a nice option.",

    "text": "Honestly at first, the name of the restaurant threw me off, but once you go in (or if you've heard from other people) it's a Korean place!  I always love going here, I've been here a lot and there isn't anything like cooking your own Korean BBQ. Their side/appetizers are always there and available for you. The place is a bit small, but isn't so bad for the amount of \"AYCE\" people. There is a regular side where you just order the food, but I actually haven't been on that side, I just enjoy AYCE too much!  One small thing that I would change are how close some of the grills are. On some of the tables there are (I believe) 2 (or 3) grills on the same table. I wouldn't want my grill on the same as someone else's party for cooking reasons. Also the neighbor's smoke could travel to your side when you're finished cooking, or vice versa.  I still love coming here though, I definitely come here a lot.",

    "text": "Not bad for $17 AYCE, my son is like $6 I think. You get the usual variety; kalbi, chicken, cow tongue, pork belly, tripe, squid, they even have hotdog (which is nice if you have kids dining), unlimited sides, rice, Korean salad, dipping sauce/oil, and bean paste soup.  Reading the other reviews I see that some are complaining about the meat quality. Well for $17 I'm not to sure how much more quality you want. You get what you pay for. If you want AAA quality meat, as if they just butchered the meat seconds before bringing it to the table, then there are plenty of $100+ NON-ayce places available. They no longer have the $14 ayce after 10pm special but that's totally fine to me. The price is great enough as it is to me.  The customer service was excellent. They always change out my grill, make sure we have water, and always be sure we are catered to. But idk some of the other reviews said you have to be Korean for them to treat you good. Typical Korean service I admit, unfortunately.  The only thing I have to complain about is that the soybean soup is a little bit on the watery side for me. I wish they added more seasoning and paste to it. Ehhh whatever.",

All our cuts of meat were VERY fatty.  Nothing like getting a mouthful of fat.  They do not trim their meat AT all, nor do they pay attention to the condition of the meat they put in your bowl.  The rib eye was completely almost hamburger, the chicken offering is limited to thighs and not cleaned up at all.  Even the beef short ribs was covered in fat.  I wouldn't cook meat in this condition at my home let alone pay for it.  The brisket was half fat, half meat and so thin you can hardly taste it.  The spicy pork belly was gross with tons of fat and/or skin attAched.  NEVER AGAIN",

Tofu Hut is is cheap and affordable, especially during their AYCE Late Night Special for only $13.99. My boyfriend and I always get the brisket, marinated ribeye, side noodles and salad are sooo good, I can't get enough of it!   The only things I don't like about this place is there's very limited parking which makes it difficult on the customers. This place is always crowded and busy that it could take up to almost an hour or more for the waiters to start seating people which could cause customers becoming irritable and impatient. Since Tofu Hut has been around for years, the best way to resolve these issues I believe is for them to expand the place for the better.",

Tofu Hut was a surprise to me, because in Hawaii the price of yakiniku is normally in the $20-30 range. Here it's about $17 for dinner per person.   This must be a very popular restaurant, because the wait time was almost 30 mins for every party and no one seemed phased. (And good luck finding parking!) However, it was worth it. Lots of selection on meat and the meal also included unlimited salad, rice, and sides.   Service is a little weird here because you cook your own food, so no one constantly checks up on you for water refills etc. They're not inattentive but you might have to wave them down if you need to order more.

We were in our way to a different restaurant when our bellhop recommended for us to try Tofu Hut.    Worst Decision Ever!!!  Service: Like most Asian restaurants, not personable, very straightforward but that's to be expected.  We really didn't come for good service, we came looking for delicious food.  We got the all you can eat special.  It comes with a large selection of meats and side dishes to choose from.  The price was great! I think the all you can eat starts at $13.95 (with a time limit) $16.95 for an extended menu with no time limit.  We anxiously awaited for our food to be cooked and started to feast.  Ugh, what a disappointment!  I do admit the portions were very generous but the meats lacked any kind of flavor.  Not only did we NOT order additional servings, we were trying to give food away to our neighbors (we didn't want to waste/ throw away food either)  Meh.... Cheap all you can eat Korean BBQ.  Eat here only if you don't like flavor :/",

I was craving for some hot tofy soup with seafood, but noticed a huge sign in the window advertising their all you can eat bbq for $16.99. The wife and I had to have it! We'd been craving for korean bbq, but never got around to it.  Well, we were impressed! The amount of food provided was great. We like to share and we ordered half portions of about everything: bulgogi (deliciously marinated), marinated pork belly (like bacon but better), beef tongue (tin slices of beef carpacio), squid (bit too chewy for me), rib eye and short ribs. All this came with rice, a huge bowl of a very tasty salad en the usual assortment of kimchee and other interesting stuff. It all tasted great and goes well with a big bottle of Hite beer. Why does korean bbq go so well with beer?  Forgot to mention they also offer steamed egg and tofu soup (one serving only). And my check came to $44 for both! Areyou kidding me, this is the best value in town. Love this place. Ate soo muich meat, I am now awake at 3am... need to eat more meat more regurarly and get used to it again...",

    "text": "Club hoppin' in Vegas can sure get you starvin' like Marvin. One of our group was a local, so she suggested we go here. If I can remember correctly, we ordered rib eye, beef tongue, squid, and pork belly. The rib eye and pork belly were my favorite. Had to help out  one of my friends by making sure everything in front of us was cooked. I nearly screamed bloody murder when they dipped a piece of raw meat into their sauce and came extremely close to eating it. That's what happens when you're low on sleep and high on alcohol. *shakes head* Our waiter checked in constantly and was nice enough to change out our grills without us asking. I wish I had the chance to try everything, but drowsiness quickly took over. Definitely a good place to hit up with a group for late night grub.",

    "text": "(gonna say this yet again) LA has definitely set my par for kbbq. tofu hut is one of those places i like to go when im reeeeeeeeeally craving it.   i like this place more that sura because the meat is sliced to order. service isnt the best, but it'll do. as mentioned in some reviews, they seem to be short handed. although, we had one of the male servers wait on our group table of about 8 of us, and we have excellent service!   this was probably my first kbbq spot (actually, my 2nd. the 1st one i didnt like at all! must find out the name of that place!) in vegas. i asked them if they served rice paper, which to me, is essential for kbbq. it gives you that rice taste but doesnt fill you up as much. apparently, \"its an LA thing\"? but anyway, that definitely made me change the way i eat kbbq out here. meat, salad and sides!  they've very good about the sides you get, as well as when i request bean paste and garlic (two other necessities when i eat kbbq).   although it doesnt compare to my new favorite spot in LA, o dae san, it definitely fills that kbbq void that i get every once in awhile. definitely not expensive at all. normally order pork belly and ribeye (wasnt a fan of the marinated one). they do have other meats which i am just not a fan of in general.   thank you, tofu hut, for filling my kbbq void in LV!",

    "text": "I've been going to Tofu Hut since my high school years and I've always had such mixed feelings about this place. There are times when my friends and I loved this place and would have a fantastic time, but sometimes we've gotten such terrible service that one of us actually stood up and left. The food, for me, was always good. I actually never tried ayce korean bbq until recently--which I enjoyed very much. For $13.99 (lunch price) I got beef tongue and pork belly; and I also shared brisket and sliced bbq with my friend.  They came in huge servings, which made it difficult for two girls to finish all that meat haha. Banchan's were standard. I've always like fish cake, so that was my favorite out of the rest. Sundobu, or however you spell it, was also okay. Their customer service is so bipolar that sometimes, even though I will be craving to go back to this place from time to time, that I would just avoid Tofu Hut all together. I think ever since I've graduated from high school, I would only go here once a year. Which is sad since the food CAN be worth the trip. Bad service included: wait staff showing attitude; wait staff seems to be non existent for quite a while during our visit; complained about splitting the check; forgetting orders and kept reminding of order; had trouble asking for refills; and last, was that they kept giving my party dirty looks because we stayed there for hours (even though we'd still order some food). This place just needs to be consistent in service and food, and I'm sure this will become a new-found favorite of my friends and I to eat at.",

Jab-che was over seasoned with too much soysauce. Kimchi was too old and jun was all burned. One side of jun was all black and tasted nothing more than flour. Sun-tofu was not bad but not good either. We ordered spicy but it wasnt spicy at all. Guk-su was terrible. Too much vinegar was used.. i almost threw up while eating. Staff was not bad. They walj around with ice water and refill it everytime you ask. Overall i will never go back. I cant believe tofu hut became this horrible. It wasnt used to be this bad. I will rather wait until mr. Tofu opens on weekdays. Please do taste before serving dishes to customers!!!",

The waiter took FOREVER to bring the check. Only reason they got a second star is because they were open late. Only reason I would go back is after a really late night with nothing open and I need a fix of Korean food.",

They have, listed under their specialties, \"Stir Fried Kimchi with Tofu\", and the waiter acted like he'd never seen this on the menu before.  The end result was that I got kimchi stir fried with spicy sauce, and some scallions (which was actually tasty, but not very exciting) surrounded by uncooked, un-marinated tofu slabs.  Not the right way to prepare tofu.  There wasn't even any extra sauce in the stir fry to put on the tofu.  I can't speak for their meat dishes, but my dinner companion didn't seem impressed.",

My girlfriend likes this place, but mostly for the experience not for anything else. She thinks the idea of cooking your own meat is fun, I, a bit less. Thats what BBQs are for. However the marinated ribeye was AWESOME. The chicken was very good too. I ordered what I thought would be brisket, but it ended up looking like thinly sliced fat with red spots in the center. Perhaps they got the order wrong..? I'd never seen brisket like that. Anyhoo, 3 stars from me because the smoke from the grill is annoying in my face as is the pace involved with tending to the food. I couldn't just relax and eat. The salad was very good though and the meats I talked about above. As for the sides..I really only cared for the doughy pancake things. I had NO IDEA what the rest of the stuff actually was aside from a seaweed type dish and the sprout/corn thingy. Also, your rice will come with oil. I tastes the oil without knowing that a layer of salt sits at the bottom. So when I dumped it into my rice, it ruined my rice. My fault? Maybe. But if you don't know the salt is there, you'll likely do the same. So, watch out. Prolly won't come back unless the lady drags me back.",

So half of the restaurant is all u can eat the other half is sit in. So in total on the all u can eat side is about 8 tables. So first let me start with the side dishes. I am korean so i know my korean food and ive been to many korean restaurants. I have never been to a restaurant whose side dishes were so untasty. The kimchee was way to sour and salty and mushy. The odang was soo mushy that u couldn't even chew it. The korean pancake was way to hard. The clear noodles (chapchee) only had noodles and the only flavor in it was soy sauce. The only thing that was slightly edible was the cucumber. The meat they served was mediocre. It was edible but not delicious. They take FOREVER  to bring the meat. We would keep ordering meat when they would bring us a plate and by the time we got our next round of meat we had already finished the first portion and waited so long the grill got burned. The portions of meat was so small. We ordered galbi they brought us two slices and the slices half of it was just straight fat. They also dont use real galbi they use skirt part of the meat not short ribs. So they charge an extra 3 dollars just to include the galbi in the all u can eat and its not even real short ribs. So even though its the cheapest korean bbq around i will never return to this place i rather pay the 21.99 that everywhere else charges to have a better experience. This place just failed at every turn. Side dishes horrible, meat was mediocre, and service was horrible as well.",

Also, they will give you a big plate of meat for the first order and then the plate becomes smaller and the meat is less. They are just so stingy and parsimony.

Just on the outskirts of chinatown, tofu hut kind of sneaks up on you.  It's an all you can eat korean bbq for just around $17/person. Ladies, if you're entertaining your guy friends from out of town and don't want to spend a bunch of money going dutch take them here!  The short ribs and ribeye are outstanding and they serve all kinds of small plates (kim chi, potato cake, bean curd, seaweed, rice, and salad) with your meal.  I don't know what it is about the salad but it's delicious.  Overall, even if the meal was ten dollars more the quality is still excellent.  The only reason I can't give this place a fifth star is because service is never really that great.  Always just kind of so-so and seating is always a hassle.  Tip for first timers: try to wear something light that you can cover up later because of the heat and fumes from the grill since you are cooking right in front of you.  I didn't know they were open late until reading others' reviews but know that I do I'll be stopping by more often!",

First attraction was the price.  Two different prices they have to offer and I prefer to go late night.    A lot of people like the marination meats, but I prefer simple fast cooking meats.  Load up on brisket and sliced rib.  Easy to cook and easy to see if they are cooked properly.  Don't want to consume undercooked meat.  I enjoyed the service here, very fast pace and on top of bringing us what we asked for.  I did try the intestines, but no taste.  Very hard to swallow.  The condiments that they offer is wonderful, always like the steamed egg.  I didn't enjoy the bean soup very much, not too much flavor.    Place gets very packed so coming early is recommended.  There is a menu selection that folks can choose instead of doing ayce.",

I always come here after tournaments, often come just because, but I've never left a review and I'm sad to say it has to be a poor one.    Like I said, I come here often, I bring people from out of town, usually come in groups of 8-12 unless it's the morning I come by with a group of 2-3 max.  I tip very well, usually tipping 80-100% of my own bill(others tipping well in the bigger groups) and always try to be pleasant and understanding as I've worked not only in Food and Beverage, but in a few KBBQ spots in California as well.  I get it.  I never have problems with these two servers: Jimmy and Albert.  They always have a great attitude, prompt service, great communication, able to read what we'll be asking for next which is huge.  These guys are gold.  There is one lady, a taller woman with black hair in a pony-tail that despite her poor service I have always tried to tip well and warm up to.  She always brings a ridiculously large plate and doesn't come back for up to an hour(she does this to avoid coming back for orders) and almost never re-fills beverages or asks if I need anything, in fact she doesn't speak at all.  Hell, maybe I'd even know her name by now like everyone else's if she would actually speak to me.  Even still, I try to be understanding(maybe she's having a bad day.  maybe that's every day apparently) and try to be easy and let things slide, act nice, tip well, etc.  Tonight was the last straw, and why I decided to finally write a review.  I showed up 2 hours ago with my fiancee, it's a slow night.  There is 3 open tables, but as not to be rude I patiently waited in front for her to acknowledge me.  8 minutes later, I was able to smile at her and she finally pointed at a table where we moved over to and sat.  Waited some more.  Finally, another lady with glasses came and took our orders/drinks. Waited some more.  Finally the original server comes and lays out the appetizers/orders/drinks all at once and walks off.  No problem here, time to start dinner.  30 minutes in: I've been out of water, there's meat scraps left, 3 empty plates, me and my fiancee are on our phones just looking around helplessly to put in another order and maybe ask for some water.  Made eye contact with this server nearly every second she walking around, multiple times in one go even.  Every time she just stares at me, I smile and try to raise my hand and nothing.  Getting annoyed, because it's been an hour by now.  Still, she manages to just stare at me and walk off.  I don't get it, at this point I'm getting very upset but trying to remain calm and just get any kind of interaction to order at least just ONE more round of food so I can pay and leave.  I did order All You Can Eat, I thought?  It's been nearly and hour and a half by now, where is she?  Well she finally starts walking up to our table. I'm making eye contact with her again, both of us staring at each other.  She walks up, pulls out the check from her apron, and walks away.  I couldn't believe the disrespect and poor service.  The horrendous attitude and pretty much \"Fuck you.\" to the entire situation.  I was able to order 3 small plates of meat and this is it?  As hard as it was to remain calm, I walked up to pay my entire bill(at this point I'm sorry, but I simply refuse to leave ANY tip) and the lady with the glasses was there.  I asked if there was any manager, or any way I could file a complaint or at least make the situation known.  To which she just said \"No, it's fine.  The Manager isn't here.\" Uh, okay? Pay my bill, start walking outside.  Immediately notice through the window the lady with the glasses attempts to talk to this server, to which the server simply shrugs then looks at the bill to check for a tip and then sighs, shrugs and walks off.  I was so upset, I walked back in and asked again if there was any way I could file a complaint or just to let her know just how poor the service was, how upset I was.  All I got was \"No, no.  It's all fine, please, sorry.\"  Am now debating if I want to do business here anymore, which doesn't just include me but about 3-4 different entire parties that come on a weekly basis. The fact I was able to write out my poor experience on a few sites while \"eating\" here shows just how little I was being served.  If I do come back, it will be strictly when Jimmy or Albert is working.  If I happen to walk in and see this lady, I will take my business elsewhere and maybe even permanently.  Would have loved to give then a high rating, but this wouldn't be read unless it was 1 Star.  I apologize, but this is the only compromise I'm given.",

The service is okay, the workers can look a bit angry but I think that's just how they are. Other than that, the food is good and cheap. If you leave a lot of left overs, they can charge you a lot. So be careful and if you want just a little more, ask for only a little otherwise you won't be able to finish it all and be charged extra. If you're planning to eat here after 10, expect to wait about half an hour for a seat because it gets pretty packed.",

We also had the brisket, it was a little fatty and was not seasoned but paired with tofu huts sesame oil and salt mixture it tasted like crispy bacon! Awesome! The sides were great I like the cucumber,  fish cake, and the kim chee of course were all very tasteful.  The waitress was very nice and I always had a full glass of water. To me this is a 4.5 all day. My only let down was the wait. I Waited for almost an hour and a half to get seated, if you are hungry like I was before going there it was hard to wait but it was worth it. The place is very small half of the inside is the table bbq with the AYCE. The other half is more of like a regular sit down and order restaurant. All in all was a ever pleasant experience and will be back for sure!",

But it should obviously change is name to meat hut or bbq hut cause the house specialty is Korean style bbq(which you can't really screw up shine it's just serving raw meat). Anyways I just was underwhelmed by my soon dubu. It was just bland and had no depth.  The broth was not a good meat broth flavor.  Tasted like water and dashida(powdered meat flavored seasoning/bullion) Definitely not my favorite place in Vegas.  I'm not saying it's bad but when I go out for soon dubu, I want the broth to be spot on, not something I could easily duplicate in my own kitchen.  Ya know what I mean? The service was below average at first but once I started speaking in Korean they wised up.  All in all, just average. Nothing spectacular nothing horrendous. :-)    It's a hip crowd, lots of young adults.  Early twenties crew.  Not really for families but more for beers, May, and friends.  Gets busy though so if you go, go early and get your name on the list!",

They need to either update or honor their hours!  Also, I didn't realize until I went to other korean bbq locations that it is even an option for the servers to help you cook your food if you're unsure about something, at other kbbq places they practically insist that I let them do the chicken for me but at Tofu Hut the servers all just stand around chatting at the counter and give you a dirty look when you finally get their attention.",

Korean Short Ribs are one of my favorite things in the world and can eat them without getting full, but that's just me.  If I recall it's like $16.99 for all you can eat Short Ribs.  The ribs are soooo tasty, the service is great and all the accoutrement they bring with your meal are delicious!  I also love that this place is open super late.    I've been to a few other Korean BBQ places in that area and they honestly didn't hold a candle it.  The only other ones I liked better were ones you had to pay a good $10 more for.  So again, for the price and quality you get here, you can't  go wrong at all.  My only tip to those who have never been to a Korean BBQ place before is to not wear clothes you plan to have on for the rest of the night.  Since you are cooking right in front you, you will smell like the fumes after.",

If you love Korean food, you'll love this establishment even more. Pay a small price for a huge meal. OK so I know I am petite but I will devour a whole cow if the flavor is on point. And it felt like I did at my last visit at Tofu Hut. Alongside the Korean BBQ Short Ribs (Gal-Bi), I also had their soup and their steamed egg -- a MUST have. The server will give you the \"All You Can Eat\" menu and there are a slew of things you can order from and they do not skimp out on ya. Ahh I love my meat, who doesn't? (except for those vegetarians and vegans)...  I am usually slightly picky on the ambiance and decor on the establishment (especially their restrooms) but you will overlook all of that once you grill the variety of meat and it will magically manifest into this heavenly, beefy aroma. It's like you're your own chef! As many Korean restaurants, they will also bring out the traditional little side dishes. You ought to try (and load up on) the salad as this is part of their side dishes too! Their dressing is a bit spicy but oh-so-flavorful. And going back on the decor, not that it was a dirty and ugly place, I would just recommend it to be more modern and more aesthetically pleasing to the eye since it is Vegas after all. Updating your look and adding another restroom wouldn't hurt in my opinion. :)  Anyway, I am salivating as I am reminiscing and writing this review...so remember empty your stomachs (not your pockets) and your taste buds will be forever grateful as you enter and leave this restaurant!",

Although Tofu Hut isn't the cheapest place around Vegas, I think it's most worth the price if you take into account the variety and quality. I always get the pork belly and marinated sliced pork belly (a must-have wherever I go) and share everything else. I love the oh-so healthy idea of dipping already-oily meat into oil and salt. I also love that they have good beef tongue and tripe, which I have recently taken a liking to. The bean paste soup and egg are pretty good as well.  And the best part of AYCE at Tofu Hut? DAT SALAD.  By the way, this is solely a review for the kbbq. I came here for tofu soup (soon dubu) one time and it was meh. That was before I discovered they had AYCE. My life has changed irreversibly since that very moment.",

I don't think this location is worth a wait for Korean BBQ due to not enough tables with a grill and service lacked.  Came here with a group of three. Prices were typical for all you can eat.  They do not have teriyaki sauce They do not have any iced tea.  The meats were marinated pretty good and decent quality too.  Service was not the best for us.

    "text": "One of the more popular, long standing KBBQ places in town, located fairly close to central Chinatown. They have the option of doing al carte or all you can eat KBBQ.   The AYCE KBBQ is i believe 13.99 (after 10pm) or 17.99 originally (or if its after 10pm, the 17.99 price gives you the option to order steamed egg and kalbi). \"Limited\" selection of meats (brisket, beef tongue, tripe, pork belly, kalbi, bulgolgi) and its not a buffet style type where you get your own stuff. The waiters will get everything for you. AYCE includes the typical side dishes you get at normal korean restaurants. Lately i havent been much of a marinated meats person, so if i go with my friend, our grill stays perfectly clean. All we order is brisket and beef tongue. Both not marinated, straight up sliced meat. Usually mainly the marinating sauces is what causes the burning and dirtying up of the grill. Rice and salad is included.   The al carte menu is not bad. I havent ordered anything other than the tofu soup or the tofu soup and bibimbap combo. Tofu soup is priced at i believe a little over $8 each. You get the normal side dishes, the tofu soup of your choice, and rice. The tofu soup and bibimbap combo, to me and a few friends, are a pretty good deal. The bibimbap is a typical korean dish with a lot of cut veggies and beef, served on top of rice, and given their gochujang? sauce (spicy sauce) for you to mix everything with. The tofu soup that it is combo'ed with is a mushroom tofu soup. Still good. Definitely fills you up. Price for the combination is i think only like $10. So not much more. Good deal.   Love coming here for tofu soup or KBBQ if its late at night and SUPER hungry. In a lot of cases, its quite full but ive never had to wait that long, if any.",

With an assortment of sides such as noodles, korean pancake, fish cake, kimchi, bean sprouts, etc you can never go wrong. Plus, it is definitely the most affordable AYCE KBBQ in Las Vegas at just $15! After 10pm when there is a cheaper special, you'll end up waiting about 30 min or longer for your table but it'll be worth it when you can indulge yourself in all you can eat meat. Sides, korean salad and rice are all unlimited with your AYCE meal, so go hungry and leave very full!",

(That is to say \"Cook your own damn food!\")   We opted for the all you can eat where you have to make 4 selections off the menu. The 4 chosen were: squid, ribeye, beef strips, and boneless chicken thigh. The seasoning on the meat was soooo good. Just enough flavoring and the meat tender. Plus there were a lot of complimentary items like of course kimchi however I was so stuffed I hardly touched them.   It wasn't too busy either which I like-you'll be guaranteed to table. Lol so I'm sure I'll yelp check-in here again.",

    "text": "Good all you can eat korean bbq at a great price. If you crave korean bbq, but dont have much money for it, just go here. Its all you can eat, but you are locked down to what meat you can get depending on the package you order. I think the package I usually get is the Las Vegas one, but I cant tell if im thinking of a different Korean BBQ joint. The environment is on par and theres nothing to complain about it. Service is also on par with no complaints at all.  The meat is good at a good price. If you have a friend whos never had korean bbq, this is a good place to have them start off since it has good and affordable food. If I were to define this place on the korean bbq scale in town it would have to be the most introductory one. Decent and filling food at a decent price is all I can say really.  Service is good and the employees are always willing to cook for you which only adds more to the introductory title.  Environment is nice, but somewhat small. With a small building, its going to have a limited amount of seats. Theres a waiting list at the host stand that is used often, so try to get there before the lunch rush starts.  Pros: perfect for people who are new to korean bbq, good food at a good price, good service. Everything is pretty much on par.  Cons: can get busy easily, seats can easily become unavailable.  Advice: bring people with you, its suited for that obviously.",

I don't think you can beat that price anywhere else and that may still hold True today (please correct me if I'm wrong!). 16.99 +tax for all day special which includes Kalbi, $13.99 +tax for late night special (10pm - 2am) and kids 4+ are half price.   Big bowl of salad, all of the traditional KBBQ sides- Korean pancakes, kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled cucumbers, etc. were all on point. We ordered Galbi, marinated pork belly, brisket, ribeye and a steamed egg. Everything tasted great. The Galbi wasn't bone in though.. Not that that is a big deal, but just a heads up.   Service was great- friendly, prompt, and I like that they didn't keep coming over while you were in the middle of eating/cooking.. The ladies just walked around frequently, eyed your table and took away any empty plates almost immediately.   You won't be disappointed!",

It was a Friday night and when we arrived, there was a 30-40 min wait! Wow, I've never seen it so packed! I guess people weren't concerned about their health violations anymore which was a good sign to me.   Once we sat down we ordered a bunch of food including: marinated short ribs (kalbi), spicy pork, pork belly, marinated pork belly, marinated rib eye (bulgogi), beef tongue, and steamed egg. We were also brought a big house salad, rice, and banchan dishes while we waited for our meat. The banchan was ok and I really only liked the kimchi. The salad was surprisingly very tasty and I actually wanted more! The salad and banchan are refillable so don't be shy! It's all you can eat!  As usual, my favorite meat was the pork belly! It was basically just sliced pork belly but it was great with the salt/pepper/oil sauce mixture they give you. The kalbi and bulgogi were good too but the thing I kept wanting more of was the pork belly! I also couldn't get enough of the sauce even though it was so simple. Goes to show that sometimes the best things in life are the simple things! The steamed egg was also awesome and I could've eaten multple bowls! My least favorite was the marinated pork belly which looked mushy and was chewy and not like pork belly at all...  The grills were ok, just make sure yours is turnt up because ours wasn't and in the beginning we were trying to figure out why it was taking so long to warm up. The vents also do nothing here so you'll smell like grilled meats when you leave here so I'd suggest not getting all dressed up to come eat here. The staff was ok as well. Sometimes it was hard to get a server's attention because it was so busy so you have to flag them down as they walk by otherwise you won't really get checked on. Parking is also pretty horrendous on busy nights so you may have to drive around multiple times to find a spot at all.  At $16.99 AYCE Korean BBQ, this place is hard to beat in value for what you get and it will remain my go to KBBQ spot.",

The selection diversity wasn't the greatest (I am slightly bias because I came from LA and there's a lot of kbbq places). The meat was good. Their side dishes were delicious especially the potato pancakes. Service was great!  I will definitely come back to try the regular menu!",

There is a bit of a wait since it's a killer deal for the all-you-can eat K-BBQ, but it pays off in the end, and it's highly affordable with a good selection.   The only thing I can say is that the service could be improved. I had to ask for a beverage, and our water was never refilled the whole time we were there. I was also left without chopsticks for half the meal, which made things difficult to say the least. It won't keep me from returning though when I'm hungry and on a budget.   Are there better places to go? Yes, but worth the money for sure.",

    "text": "I have been going to this place for years. It's always packed. They do not have a tremendous selection but then again all I really want to eat is the tongue and the brisket. It's Korean BBQ so you grill your meats on the table. It does get smoky in there, so be forewarned. Take your oxygen pills before coming in. Waiting is a process where you sit and watch people play on their phones or listen to idle chit chat. I, usually wait outside. They come and call your name outside anyway. Unless you like to experience what a sardine must feel and partake in the sitting arrangements in the comfortable hard wooden bench.  The place will not win any awards for looks but the food is good. The staff is small but they all work hard and fast. Especially, the poor busgirl. She is superfast. I hope they share tips with her. Maybe, I'll just tip her directly. I hate when hard working people get stiffed working at restaurants.  So, I have tried everything on the menu. The steamed eggs is available in the daytime but costs extra at night. Why you want a steamed egg, I have no idea. It's a steamed egg, people! I steam them at home all the time. Take a few eggs, fill it with water, and whisk the heck out of it, and steam it. If you put too much water in, it will be ok, because the water will just shift out. BUT, if you put too little water, the egg is not silky smooth and pock mocked like the moon.  I did not care for the pork belly. It tastes like, well, whatever that porker ate. It's very porkish tasting...in a bad way. I usually skip the ribeye and go for the marinated ribeye. I am not a fan of the tripe either, tasteless. The squid is a giant squid and kind of bland as well. I don't BBQ chicken so have never ordered it. The short ribs are fat as heck so I stay away from that stuff.  The bean paste soup is tasty. It is cooked with squash, onion, and full of flavor. I usually get 2. I love the salad, I am not sure what they put in it but it is crunchy and full of sesame oil flavor. Ok, it's probably sesame seed oil, some Korean red pepper, and sugar, but I cannot duplicate it at home.  I tried to go early and pay the extra $3 to eat at 9:30 but the wait pushed me into the discounted $13.99 price if that tells you how busy they are. Why don't I go earlier? I have not the slightest idea. It just seems we get a craving late nights and dredge ourselves in protein that would normally kill a horse.  Service is fast and they do bring it out. Sometimes, they are so busy that they may forget, so just order a bunch of items at once to make it easy on them and yourself. Unlike Kona Grill where you are made to feel you are judged, service here really is just too busy to serve all your needs at once. No complaints here.  The soda comes in a can so if you are like me and want to imbibe in enough carbonation to float to the ceiling, you may want to pass.  One last thing, you can ask for a new grill once the old one gets crusted up. No need to sit there and breathe in carcinogens or squint to see people around you. :) Unless, you are hard up training for that chimney sweep position, then by all means...",

I mean the tofu soup was fairly okay, but you have to have tofu soup and LA Bbq together because it is just a perfect combination. Maybe because SoGongDong Tofu place in New Jersey gave me really good experience, so I might have had a high expectation, but I still feel that this isn't right. I will try another tofu place next time.",

Put that aside and BAM, you've got the best KBBQ in town for the BEST prices!  You can never go wrong with Tofu Hut. I've never had issues during or after my visits (and trust me, I've gone more times than you could ever imagine).   I'm a firm believer of, if it tastes good, and cost is reasonable, then WHY NOT. Nothing bad has ever happened to me, so until then, I'm on Tofu Hut's side.  They have AYCE KBBQ. After 10pm it's cheaper, and a DEAL TO STEAL!!!!!   My top three to order would be: brisket, bulgolgi, and squid.  They have the BEST salad in China Town. No other KBBQ salad could ever compare to their salad. It's got a yummy sauce and a little spicy kick to it that will make you crave it on the daily.   Their steamed egg is okay, I've had much better in another spot in town.  But, for price, and quality, you can't get any better than Tofu Hut.  Screw what the people say, my friends and I will always be found here.  Be careful for wait times, it can be extremely long if you're with a large party!",

    "text": "While a ton of folks recently are giving Tofu Hut dismal star ratings, I'm gonna go out on a limb here at up mine a 1/2 star...now up to 4 stars!  Yes, I know it's tough finding stellar AYCE Korean BBQ in Las Vegas, especially with all you visitors from Cali-for-nia.  But I've been to Tofu Hut twice within a month for some reason, even with that other AYCE Korean BBQ joint right down the street (which shall remain nameless but we'll call it SUUURRRAAA), so it must be telling me something.  At Tofu Hut for the price of $16.99 AYCE all day long?  Hard to beat pricing.  But with the $13.99 AYCE late night special?  Even harder.  Try finding a table at 11 PM, HA, you got a better chance of getting tickets for the San Diego Comic Con!  That line is ridiculous!  Mainly because Tofu Hut only has like 12 tables available for AYCE since the other half of the restaurant is menu offerings exclusively.  Yes, I know that sometimes the quality of the Korean meats is not consistent.  You go one time, it's decent, you go the next time, it's lackluster.  First time I went the quality was suspect, but the last couple times I went the meats were actually better than OK.  So to each their own.  But their kalbi short ribs are damn tasty!  Just wish they would include the bones for me to suck on, the cartilage around them is HEAVEN!  And is also good for your joints by the way.  Yes, I know that you have a LIMIT of only 4 meats (sometimes 3) per table at any one time.  Just order your meats and be done with it.  No sense in arguing.  Just cook your first order of meats, eat BBQ, drink soju, be merry, sing along to some Big Bang or Girls Generation, THEN order another 4 plates of meat.  Get the Steamed Egg while you're at it too because it's delicious.  Yes, I know that their banchan may seem like a small selection compared to other Korean BBQ places.  But you know what?  They aren't that bad at all.  You got all your basics - kim chee, seaweed, bean sprouts, and a couple others too.  Just be like me and politely ask for an extra TWO orders of kim chee.  Wife hates me, but tummy loves me.  Don't forget to get a large bowl of salad!  Good stuff.  Lastly, yes, I know that the service at Tofu Hut can be strenuous at times.  Just remember, you're in Chinatown...almost NO ONE is nice!  I'm not saying it to be racist, I myself am like an eighth Chinese!  So yes, the employees at Tofu Hut can come off as a bit rude or uncaring.  What are you expecting, turn down service from a French maid?  (Hmm...I'm sensing some role-playing in my near future.)  These guys must be tired of running back & forth for the unlimited amounts of carcass and rice we are devouring!  And imagine...these folks have to be around fermented Korean veggies ALL...DAY...LONG.  That's bound to make anyone have a bit of a stinky attitude.  Plus, they're surrounded by smoke and HOT @$$ grills for an entire shift.  You ever scrub one of those cast iron grills with burnt on meat & caramelized Korean marinade?  Get ready for tennis elbow.  Believe me when I tell you...if you're never been in the food service industry, you just don't know.  And if you don't know...well now you know.  IT.  IS.  TOUGH.  UNGODLY even.  So while I hate bad service and I do realize someone did take that job of being a server or a dishwasher...I know it ain't easy keeping a smiley face all day.  Luckily for us, our recent visits have only been on borderline rude, almost pleasant even!  What it boils down to is this:  want fairly good AYCE Korean BBQ, with a fairly good price?  Tofu Hut is not a bad bet.  Need to find the cheapest late night AYCE Korean BBQ in Vegas?  Tofu Hut is probably your best bet.  You want the best service?  Take yourself to a Gordon Ramsey restaurant!    #aycekoreanbbqwithextrakimcheegivesmemadgas",

They even have unlimited salad :)  It's self serve so you'll do all the cooking, but the servers are always circulating making sure everyone is doing okay/need anything.  If the grill gets burnt, you can always ask for them to swap it for a fresh one!  Each table will have a list of things you can order so more table space for food.  Great place to eat late nights or after drinking. (Oh, and they have soju so continue drinking)   Definitely would recommend this place.

There are many other KBBQ places that are a couple dollars more, but so much more worth it than going to Tofu Hut.  When you go into Tofu Hut there is a paper waitlist that you just add your name to. I came around 10 PM and the wait was already really long. We waited about 40 minutes before the host was SUPPOSED to call our party's name, but he let his friends that came in and waited barely 10 minutes ago in front of us. This already angered my party.  Cons: - No rice paper - Charge an automatic 15% gratuity for 4 people or more (which is ridiculous) - Horrible staff (rude, does not change grills, no customer service what-so-ever) - Small selection of meats - Long wait time - Only half of the restaurant is KBBQ - Staff will place their friends in front of you on the waitlist  Pros: - \"Cheap\" Price (if you go with 3 people or less)",

The short rib, rib eye and chicken see good.  The squid was very bland, not taste what so ever.  The pork belly is nasty and not fresh!  The beef tongue was ok,  I can skip it. The Kim chi is limited to only 6 side dishes.  I was a little disappointed bc I LOVE Kimchi.  So that was a little disappointing!  The wait was not bad we early arrived around 3pm to beat the crowd.   ALSO there's only a 90 mins to your eat and can NOT order more than 4x of each dishes. Technically is it still call ALL U CAN EAT IF THERE ARE CONDITIONS??",

    "text": "Tofu Hut has been my go-to AYCE kbbq since day one! I've tried a few other places with more meat and side options, but at the end of the day I would still choose Tofu Hut because of their price vs food quality ratio. $16.99 all you can eat can't get any better! Side note, compared to other kbbq- they DO have the best salad, so good that I have random cravings for it. Just like other good places, expect to wait during peek hours- but totally worth it. It's also in a huge lot so you can always find parking.",

    "text": "This review is not for their ayce... Came here after watching Zarkana hungry for some Korean comfort food. We ordered a bunch of stuff including all their special bbq plates of bulgogi, short rib, shrimp and scallops and spicy chicken. They came with a small soon dobu and we got the kitchen beef and mushroom flavor.   5 stars:  short ribs!!  The galbi was very flavorful and tender. Not heat at all like some places can be. The texture was so soft and delicious. We got two orders of it.   Besides the short ribs... All the other stuff was just mediocre. I use to live in Ktown in la and was really disappointed in the tofu soup. The color is way off... It's a watery light pink color. The consistency was too watery.. And the flavor just wasn't there. I think mr tofu across the street serves wayyyy better tofu soup. The spicy chicken and the shrimp and scallops were good but nothing special. The bulgogi was decent as well too.   As for their side dishes..they served really good kimchi!  Not too fermented and crunchy just the way I like it. They also had seaweed, japchea, bean sprouts and Korean pancake. Usually Korean pancake is my favorite thing but this one was extremely thick and doughy with little flavor. It was also soggy.   I think for meats.. The galbi is unbeatable. For for tofu soup I'm gonna visit somewhere else.",

After you sign in, make sure your entire party is present to be sat because they are limited on seating. They have a small but filling selection to choose from for the grill. The beef tongue, brisket, and short ribs are our favorites. The food is fresh and you can enjoy the little dishes they bring out for you as well. Love the salad and the clear noodles they serve. There is a 90 minute which I think is more than enough time to enjoy your food. There aren't desserts but the food itself is so satisfying that you don't really have the space for it. The staff was super friendly and attentive to all our needs. We can't wait to come back again.",

(could've been 5 stars!)   The LONG lines and waiting when you can see the other side of the restaurant not being used! They only have 7 vents and tables for the Korean BBQ grill. The other side is not used, they're just ordinary tables. Management knows their restaurant is famous because of the Eat All You Can Korean BBQ, and yet they still chose not to convert the whole place with table BBQ grills. It just contradicts every practical business sense. They should have VERY GOOD reasons for keeping all those unused tables the way they are until now!   We were 7 groups waiting and I counted 7 potential tables on the other side, saving thier customers the time and frustration. But you will know thier food is fantastic, as we were all willing to wait. Made me want to just call management and ask them their reasons, as it baffles my mind.   But other than that, if you don't mind being on a waiting list and wait for atleast 20 to 30 mins on busy hours, by all means go and try this joint! Thier food and price will NOT DISAPPOINT!",

    "text": "Ahh, Tofu Hut. The most incorrectly named restaurant in Vegas. Make no mistake, this place is a giant meat-fest. Tofu is going to be the last thing on your mind, and the restaurant places zero emphasis on it outside of its name.   The best way I can describe this place is that it's a great, well priced AYCE Korean BBQ option for when you're not sure where to go or don't want to bother with being fancy. You know this is not the best Korean BBQ in town, but its pretty darn good and that's just fine. You want tasty meats and you want it now without any fuss. The fundamentals of good food and good service are there, and that's what's ultimately important. It's definitely the default option for myself and my friends when we get a Korean BBQ craving.  1. Food: The meat is medium to high quality. You'll rarely get meat that is a disappointment in terms of flavor and texture. Selection is Korean BBQ staples such as pork belly, marinated steak, short rib, chicken, squid, intestines, and my favorite, beef tongue. The only thing I would recommend avoiding is the intestines, as they're chewier and more rubbery than they should be. It's AYCE, so go nuts on portions without being \"those people\" that order too much and waste a lot.  Sides are standard Korean BBQ fare. Kim chi, bean sprouts, potato, seaweed, that bready stuff I don't know the name of, and sweet tofu. You also get salad, which is surprisingly good. You'll be faced with an internal battle of how much of these you'll want to eat since they'll take away valuable real estate in your stomach that would otherwise be occupied with the onslaught of meat.  A minor quibble is that they don't offer a variety of sauces for your meaty goodness. You get oil and salt (which honestly is usually sufficient), and sriracha if you request it. That's it. Some other asian sauces as an option would be super.  They also offer no dessert, so plan for a trip to one of the nearby boba or ice cream places after. You'll need it after the savory overload.  2. Service: Generally solid. It's not difficult to get someone to assist you when you need to place another order or need a refill on oil and salt, sides, or drinks. They check on you periodically, but sparingly. This is actually a good thing as they're not as overbearing on service as some other Korean BBQs I go to where they hover over you all the time. The staff is friendly, though sometimes ordering can be a bit muddled due to the language barrier, depending on who is serving or seating you.   Most importantly, and I can't stress this enough, they let you cook your own food at your own pace. This really defines the Korean BBQ experience.  There are numerous places I've been to where they cook it for you, and usually, that means they put the whole plate on at once. I hate that. It's not good service for this kind of eating. A large part of the fun is cooking it to your liking, in addition to eating what you want, when you want. You have power over your meat (insert obvious jokes here). It's the worst when you get to the second half of a plate of meat and it's already cold from having been cooked earlier when you didn't want it yet. You're stuck either reheating it, making it tougher, or letting it go to waste.  3. Environment: It's small, and it's crowded but clean and not unpleasant. That means you're going to want to plan on going there when it's not busy, otherwise, you're in for a long wait. Korean BBQ is not a fast eating experience. Getting seated before 6 pm, especially on Friday and Saturday, is your best bet.  Decor and ambiance are mostly no frills, in good condition, clean, and not bad to look at it. Let's be honest though, you're here for the meats, not to admire the art on the walls or how nice the chairs look.  In summary, if you want a lot of good meats at a good price ($18 AYCE) without frills or fuss, and complete freedom in how to prepare your food, this is the place for you.",

The marinated rib eye was so tender and tasty I wanted to eat more but was too full to order anymore.  Also the served steamed eggs which alot of others charge you if you want it.

I've gone here about a handful of times, and even though it gets super packed, the wait times are never ridiculous.  Also, Tofu Hut is cleaner than most AYCE korean places that I've been to.  The best price - $16.99 for AYCE.  They have a late night special price, but I forgot what the dollar amount is.  Generous portions of meats.  It's not the kind of buffet you get up and grab.  They bring the meats to you.  I love the ribeye, the marinated pork belly, and brisket.  There's a list of about 10 choices for AYCE, but if you are sharing with one other person, 2 or 3 meats are plenty.  Also comes with a side of salad and of course kimchee, bean sprouts, tofu (the usual 8-10 side dishes that come with your meal for every korean restaurant ever).    Wash it all down with hot barley tea.  A must every time I go to a Korean restaurant.",

We tried everything in the menu but we now only order the beef tongue, pork belly, squid, kalbi and the steam egg which we like the most. The salad and the other sides were pretty good as well.  I think they offer $13.99 per person after 9 pm, but for this price you can't get the kalbi and steam egg. Their place was small, you may have to wait if you get in during the dinner time.",

    "text": "I've been eating too much lately. Way too much. So what do I do when I get a text invite to do Tofu Hut AYCE at 11:30pm?  It was my first time there. I really didn't know about it. At $13.99, this place kills the $26 table-grilled item I ordered at Pho So 1 just a few nights ago. (Then again, you're probably supposed to share that one). For $13.99, you get to choose from everything but the last two items (short ribs and steamed egg); those are available at the $16.99 AYCE price, but we were happy with sticking to $13.99.  We started with Sliced Ribeye, Brisket, and Beef Tongue. The ribeye was the most flavorful, but I have a soft spot for beef tongue, nay, I freakin' heart beef tongue! The brisket was OK. We liked the ribeye so much, we ordered another plate. I also added Tripe Honeycomb to the mix. I love tripe too. It had a nice spice to it and charring it on the grill added nice flavor.  On our final round, we went with the Squid and Marinated Pork Belly. The squid was OK, but not a lot of flavor. The pork belly had good spice and went well with the steamed rice I had left (I wasn't eating much of it up to this point). Speaking of steamed rice, they bring out a plethora of side dishes to go with the meats - Kimchi, Pickled Cucumber, Pickled Radish, and other stuff I can't name. Everything that hit the table was delicious.  Oh yeah. My friend wanted to order OB, but they were out, so we settled for Hite. Not a bad beer, but nothing memorable.  Overall, I have to give them four stars. Granted, it was my first time at any place that does that style of AYCE, but I fully enjoyed it. It was a fun time with some photographer friends that I hadn't seen in a while. Jason put it best when he said, \"I don't know if I needed the giant meat fest, but I sure enjoyed it.\" That's what she said?  One last thing: your clothes will definitely smell like food when you leave!",

The KPop playing via projector on the wall was entertaining, but not to loud. I need to come back to the Tofu Hut real quick for the Korean BBQ! It looked and smelled awesome and there was a decently long wait list for a Thursday night in Chinatown.",

Food was amazing (it does help if someone in you party knows how to cook meat...if not it will definitely be a learning experience for you). All you can eat and over all a good place. Only recommendation is if your traveling in a big party, arrive early. We were a party of 7, so we waited a bit for a table. Also (if traveling in a big party), apparently gratuity was included in our bill without the server informing us or indicating on the bill...just a heads up if you don't want to double tip",

The salad was very good and so was the kimchee. All the other sides didn't do anything for us. Our favorites were the marinated pork belly, short ribs, and marinated ribeye.  Forget about the other cuts of meat. They are bland and unseasoned.  Im taking off one star for atmosphere..it could have been better ventilated. I came out smelling like korean bbq from grilling the meat. Also because of the wait staff.  They weren't the friendliest group.  Like...sorry I asked for more kimchee and meat!

So good for a salad. Sided are no different for any other sides I've had at others but I would for sure come back again. We had about 6 sides and it comes with a bowl of rice for each person.   The entire place seemed to be remodeled/updated because tables and space looked very modern and clean. The bathrooms were just as updated as the dining space which was a nice surprise considering the small hallway you take to get to them.  Anytime price (the hours that are not listed below) is $16.99 per person Hours between 10pm and 3am the price is $13.99 per person.",

The beef tongue, brisket, and ribs have great meat to fat ratio. Although, one time the tongue had no fat and we ended up with charred rubber-like disks...but oh well.   My favorite part of the meal are the little banchan plates that accompany the hot meat so damn well. Kimchi, cucumbers, bean sprouts, fish cakes, and noodles are given. The plain looking shredded salad surprised me the most. It's laced with delicious vinaigrette and it's so good, I want the recipe now!",

I got there @ 1045 pm which they had special price for the customers eating between 10 pm and 2 am.  We had 3 adults, and 2 little kids.  They said kids will be charged half price of adult which was fine however they did not tell us that short rib order won't be covered for promo price.  We ordered 2 short rib, 2 thin beef, 2 pork belly, and  2 steam eggs for 5 people.  Because of 2 order of Short rib they wouldn't want to charge for promo price, even for kids who ate meat barely.  If we ate a lot of meat as usual all you can eat places, I wouldn't be mad. However, it was late night and we only ordered 6 portions of meat but still got charged full regular price even with kids, made me very disappointed at their customer service. Before we left, I told them how I felt about getting charged full reg price but they did not CARE!!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE..",

I came here with my fiance and 10 month old son on a Monday afternoon. When we arrived we had to wait just a couple of minutes for them to \"clean\" off a table. When we got to our table, we noticed that it was still dirty! Still had condensation rings from cups, and still greasy and sticky on multiple parts of the table. We ended up cleaning it ourselves with baby wipes.   We needed a high chair for my son - and oh how I wish I had a high chair cover for what was provided for us. Their high chair was the nastiest high chair I have ever seen. There were lots of dried up food, and it was sticky all over! I tried to clean it with baby wipes - but there was only so much I could do. I doubt they have ever cleaned that high chair. It was so disgusting and nasty.  We were seated against one of the windows and you could just see the amount of dust and dirt on the window sill. The floors were also super greasy.. You could literally slide around on their floors. And I just loved getting my banchan served on a filthy tray that had pieces of raw meat and rice on it. Would it kill them to wipe down their serving trays?  Normally we wouldn't stay in a place like this after all the red flags. But we had an appointment to get to and didn't have time to go somewhere else.  We ended up ordering the marinated ribeye, short ribs, beef tongue, beef brisket and pork belly. They were all pretty standard as far as Korean BBQ places go.   Standard Korean BBQ in a filthy restaurant. No thank you.",

It's $16.99 AYCE during normal day hours and after 10pm it's $13.99 (if you don't order short ribs).   If you're a hungry-hungry-hippo like me, then this place is a steal!  I always, always, always get beef tongue. (For anyone who hasn't had beef tongue, don't start. It's gross... haha. MORE FOR ME!) My boyfriend will always get the pork belly. I recommend the non-marinated choice. The marinated pork belly cuts are almost straight fat.   They don't offer a huge variety of meat, but again, for the price I don't mind.  The sliced ribeye and brisket are pretty good. The tripe honeycomb is ok. It's not at all like any kind of tripe I've eaten before. I didn't really care for it. The squid just comes in a plate, whole. A little weird, not too much seasoning either. I don't like getting chicken just because it takes FOREVER to cook. The steamed egg and bean paste soup are not bad but I've had better ones.  Their service is hit or miss. There's one server who is really good and tries really hard to keep up. But it seems like they have all of 3-4 servers at a time. So they fall behind on the service, especially during prime times of 7-830pm.  Oh and another thing I love is the SALAD. I swear its laced. Just kidding but oh my gosh I could go there for the salad alone.   All in all this is a place I happily bring visitors too. Always a good spot after going out & drinking.",

They tend to lose customers when there are long lines since there are a lot of ayce kbbq nearby, yes probably you'll pay a little more but ill take that anytime rather than waiting for an hour to eat!

The place has only several BBQ table so if it is full house, you will wait for a long time, though they have time limitation of 90 minutes for the AYCE.    Their side dishes are all delicious.  Do not forget to order their salad!  It is included in the AYCE and super tasty!  Their soup and steamed eggs were meh to me.  We ordered brisket, short rib, tongue and marinated pork...Excellent!  Their squid was tender and not chewy either.    I live in Tampa now and used to live in NY and the price here is ridiculously cheap!  I have no idea how their kitchen menus are and it is funny this place is called \"Tofu Hut\" because they serve a lot of meat, but I would recommend you to go for their AYCE BBQ!",

Place is small, but we got there at 5:10 on a Saturday and probably had to wait 10-15 minutes. The line didn't get too unmanageable during the time we were there until the time we left (probably around 7:00pm).  Recommendations: short ribs (obvious choice, well seasoned and marbled, so good!), rib eye, and steamed egg! Would avoid the sliced pork belly as it's pretty salty and the regular pork belly is probably what's more of the standard. Brisket was ok, but there was way too much of it.",

Walk through the door and you're just hit by this sesame seed oil aroma that just says 'welcome to a Korean place' . That was nice.   The first thing that shocked me is they ran out of Korean beers, no Hite or OB left because of the lunar new year. Then again the place was empty so they must not have restocked since the previous night.  I ordered a kimchi and tofu stew and several times asked for extra vegetables to be added in. extra vegetables weren't added in... overall the stew hit the spot and my friend's spicy chicken was to her tasting and then some.  I did enjoy the food and service here but a few reasons will keep me from coming back:  1) Price - To be honest i'm cheap, money shouldn't be thrown around epically in this piss poor economy we're in. This place has very little of anything other then soups under the ten dollar range  2) Variety - I expected to see more tofu centered dishes instead of seeing a large section dedicated to taking advantage of the table grills for Korean BBQ, instead of 'Tofu Hut' call it 'BBQ Hut'  3) Ignored my request to add extra vegetables - It's not like i'm ordering a cut of premium meat with a side of extra premium meat, sometimes you just want more then tofu and kim chi like say...other greens. Hell i don't care if they charge me extra for it i would have paid a little extra just to enjoy the vegetable enhanced soup.",

There seems to be a few of these yakiniku spots in the Spring Mountain Chinatown area, although, this place is not bad.  I typically like it when I do not have to go picking my food from a salad bar full of raw meats to cook up...similar to Camelia's back in the islands for my Hawaiian folks.  This place is more like Million's, I take that back...only in the sense that you don't have to pick your own meats to cook and they serve it to you.  Might be scary for some that aren't used to cooking their own food and this style of restaurant, but it is a cultural experience.  Just remember not to make any other plans afterwards...you will be reeking like you just got done working an 8-hour shift in the kitchen.  I know some don't understand the concept of paying to cook your own food, but its a cultural thing again, so this place may not sit well with explorers that are not familiar with Asian culture.  Nothing pisses me off more than wannabe foodies that only blog about burgers and hot dogs and like to bad mouth other food genres.  So if you are not already used to this, try to keep an open mind.  But if you are very particular, do yourself a favor and pass.  Still, I have seen better, but you can surely get your fill for a decent price.",

This time for a little something feastllike. Yes All you can eat bbq. Well first off at the price of 13.99 - uhm economically hit wallet was economically happy. It was one of those late night things. But I  had the brisket, tongue and pork belly. those made me really happy. The salad was pretty tasty too. I especially liked a giant bowl of salad with crushed red peppers and onions. All the little side thingies were definitely not disappointed. I guess I didnt like the marinated ribeye so much, It was a little too sweet for me. Just give me the meat with no seasoning so I can dip it in my concoction of sesame oil, salt and pepper and symphonize a ballet in my mouth. Plie, plie.....now arabesque along with the lettuce......",
