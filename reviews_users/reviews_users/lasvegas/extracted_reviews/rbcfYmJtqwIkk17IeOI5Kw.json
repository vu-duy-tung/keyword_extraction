    "text": "Came here with three of my girlfriends and shared one entree, one side, and one appetizer. We weren't that hungry and didn't want to be too stuffed before going out. The amount we ordered ended up being perfect (bc we also had the bread they brought for the table). Can't miss out on the \"best butter in the world.\" Honestly the butter was good! But it was pretty average compared to butter at any other nice restaurant. Really delicious rib eye and black truffle fries!! the sauces on the side perfectly complimented the meat. It is pretty heavy though. The fries were more airy than expected but very crispy and hot. The Brussels sprouts were not the best I've ever had but still tasty? They were a little too flavored with vinegar. The charcuterie board was good! The little pickles were to die for!!! The prosciutto and salami were tasty. overall this restaurant is very cute and has a nice ambience. It isn't it of this works but would definitely come back!",

    "text": "Dined at BARDOT yesterday.  For 2 glasses of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 courses was over $200 with tip. Clearly the value was no near that cost.  Your first clue that this restaurant is mediocre is they charge for butter.  Haven't been to any other restaurants on the strip that charges for butter. Thought the dishes that we ordered were generally bland.  I ordered the prime rib special.  It was just a huge slab of meat that was not cooked properly.  Not sure the weight of the serving (it was not on the menu and the waiter didn't say) but the size was offensive.  Maybe BARDOT thinks serving huge portions will distract you from the fact that the food is mediocre at best.  My wife got a scallop dish that she didn't like and made her feel queasy later in the evening.  Clearly there are much better restaurants than this one.",

    "text": "YUM! Going to Bardot for brunch was such a great experience! Brunch is my favorite meal of the day so I am SUPER particular, but there are so many little things here that elevated our experience... first of all the caneles were SO good. They are a French delicate pastry, and rather than order the entire basket with a bunch of various pastries, we each got one... and they were literally the best thing I ate in Vegas all weekend!! I highly recommend everyone gets one... the drinks and complimentary bread were also right on point! The food itself was good, creative takes on brunch (my eggs were in a hollowed out croissant which was good), and the ambiance was really fun! In looking back, although it would have been weird with brunch, the French onion soup that others were eating looked SO good, wish I would have ordered that instead of the hash browns, which had cheese on top that had a texture that was a little too close to melted American cheese for me (which is not something I am a big fan of...). Overall it was a really great brunch, and I would absolutely return in the future!",

We had the crab benedict (outstanding and probably better to get one for yourself because you won't want to share!), the mussels (exactly what you would expect), and the smoked salmon benedict (love that it's in a croissant pastry but salmon was a little too salty for my taste, will try another next time instead). The house bread was also the yummy, chewy kind with room-temp. butter. Oh, and don't skip the cocktails-- the melon cocktail we had was out of this world.  The only negative for us was the fact that everything. took. forever. I was getting so impatient by the end. I think we waited 5 minutes just to get the check. Our server was lovely but I don't know if she had a lot of tables or she was just slow, but my goodness!   Will definitely come back!",

    "text": "I had no idea what I was in for when I made my plans to hit up BARDOT Brasserie for a solo dinner.  I only knew that they were pretty new and that they have a happy hour menu with some terrific sounding selections.  I had absolutely no idea of their pedigree!  That being their association with James Beard Award-winning chef Michael Mina.  Finding this place was step one.  Fortunately I had read that it was in the neighborhood of the Zarkana theater, which turned out to be up a flight of escalators from the casino floor.  But instead of heading towards the theater, I found it to my right when heading towards the buffet, as direct neighbor to the Jean Georges Steakhouse.  I liked the little tables set for two bordering the exterior wall of the restaurant, but I headed in to the bar area to enjoy a meal made up of selections from their Happy Hour menu, available daily from 5-7pm at the bar and lounge area.  These are smaller offerings of some of their regularly priced and portioned appetizers, which is great for a single diner who wants to try a bunch of things.  Tip - eat the Escargots $6 toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse butter, puff pastry shells while they're hot.  They are less a wonderment once cooled.  The Duck Wings A L'Orange $4 Wood grilled duck wings, seasoned citrus, sauce maltaise were meaty and tender and arrived 3 pieces to an order, as did the escargot.  The Bone Marrow $5 Roasted bone marrow, red wine onion jam, grilled country bread was perfectly portioned for one.  So if snails don't weird you out, definitely get the escargot, but I'd order any of these again.",

This time was the last since there are so many other great places to go and the last couple times the experience has been lacking. Today no coffee refills. No water refills. Took an exceptionally long time for a basic breakfast. No more NY steak and eggs - filet only. Great if you love filet, but I don't so didn't get it and that was a let down. The thick cut bacon just isn't very good. The American in Paris breakfast is \"okay,\" but that's really all it is. I've had the French toast before and that is admittedly epic, but it's way too much for one person. Hunter's Waffle is again, just okay. Over all service is lacking the last couple of times and today the food was also sort of sub par. Bouchon at the Venetian is compatible and far superior so next time we will remember that.",

    "text": "Huge disappointment. Service was slow, which was understandable since it was busy when we got there, but soon we realized half the tables were empty and our server was MIA. We ordered off of the summer prix fixe menu which sounded great. I went straight down the middle, starting with a classic French onion soup. The cheese and bread were the stars here. The soup itself was on the sweet side, under seasoned, and unmemorable. Next up was steak au poivre, and this was the biggest let down. The meat itself was sub par and untrimmed. In the accompanying picture, you can literally see the silver skin and gristle left on the steak. It was tough, over cooked, AND came out lukewarm. What a joke. The mille-feuille was ok, but was made by brutes with heavy hands. This delicate dish translates to thousand leaves was 4 layers of thick puff pasty too hard to cut without a knife layered with thick layers of filling. Flavor was ok, but execution was terrible.   The winners at Bardot? The French fries and complimentary bread and butter. Everything else was embarrassingly unfortunate, especially considering Michael Mina's name on the door. If it were a more pedestrian establishment, I would have given it 3 stars, but for the $$$$, it doesn't deserve to be in the same category as other fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas.   My advice, put your $200 on the roulette table. The odd are better than Brasserie Bardot.",

Very much like a brasserie in Paris. We ordered the frisee salad which was good but the egg was not poached but pretty much boiled which defeats the purpose of the egg in the salad. I ordered the heritage chicken that came with mushroom bread pudding and green beans. It tasted great except only the meat close to the bone was a little pink so I avoided eating that part.  Also got the steak frites which was good. The best dish was the macaroni gratinee. Never had it served this way but it was the best. At the end they gave me some pretty flowers :) Must go back to try the amazing looking desserts!",

We were served by Nereida, who had a friendly demeanor, plentiful knowledge, and made great recommendations throughout.  Cocktails were standard morning fair- a peach bellini for my girl, mimosa for me. While wonderful, 15 bucks a pop is a little much. All the other food was well worth the price.  Charcuterie board to start and it was divine. The prosciutto was just a touch fatty and hard to cut, but the flavor was excellent. The pate went beautifully with the bread served, and the pork spread even better.  For entrees, steak and eggs for the girlfriend. She growled when I tried for a bite of the steak so I'm assuming it was spot on.  As for me, I would live on my entree if I could. The Hunters Waffle was duck confit on a waffle with over easy egg on top. I really can't describe it, but can say if you're here for brunch, this should be a serious first look. It was beyond amazing. Melted in my mouth, the egg yolk and duck went together so well, and the waffle soaked up the excess. All in all, an experience not to be missed. Aria continues its stellar reputation for fine dining, even for something as simple as brunch. A new staple to add to my vegas favorites. Look for many return visits from me!",

    "text": "Well... I probably had very high expectations, having recently been to both Paris and Jaleo. The food technique was good, but not impressive.   We had the charcuterie ensemble; prosciutto was fresh and delicious but a bit think for the type (I think it was Parma or some sweet Italian).   Onto roasted octopus salad: the texture was just off; tough and chewy. I know it's vegas and we don't have octopuses swimming around freely on the strip... but don't put it as a special.  It turned me off to order anything else. Especially because the rubber octopus didn't come cheap.  But I was a masochist and ordered dessert.  Salted caramel something with hazelnut creme. It was ok - it was basically a stale donut with some creme in between.   Drinks were ok - weak and overtly sweet. I felt like I was drinking syrup out of a glass.   You might think - why the 4 stars then? If you have complained all the way?  Well, Kim, our server, was really nice and friendly. She made sure we were taken care of.  The vibe was good. The bread was fresh. The ingredients were fresh. But it just didn't come together in execution.  I will check it out again in two weeks. We will see!",

When God created woman is now my wife's favorite cocktail one of their signature drinks. The bar staff was great say hi to Eric Brooke Alex Michelle Dino thanks guys. All three of the appetizer tartine's were fantastic the chef puts out super clean and flavorful food. And then we went the fourth day for brunch, I had the lobster scramble it was awesome and my wife had a croissant Benedict whatever you choose you can't go wrong. We are looking forward to our next trip to the Aria and Bardot are new HomeBase. Cheers",

The ambiance is intimate, service warm and friendly, and the food is delicious. Every dish is beautifully presented and reasonably priced.   + PRIME STEAK TARTARE: We ordered the small order to share (among 5 people), and it was more than enough, especially if you're looking to order multiple appetizers to share. The beef is delectably tender and is ground to order.   + SEARED FOIE GRAS LYONNAISE: The more extravagant of their two foie dishes, this is the one to get if you want the full on texture of foie gras. The foie melts in your mouth, but the star of the dish was the beluga lentils, I could eat a whole plateful of the lentils.  + KING CRAB CREPE: I loved the simplicity and elegance of this dish. The trumpet mushrooms paired very well with the crab, and the buckwheat crepe was very delicate. Tasty dish and also very Instagrammable  + BONE MARROW AU POIVRE: Rustic and hearty are the two best words to describe this dish. Aesthetically beautiful, the bone marrow is a golden brown and is served with country bread. Usually I'm tentative about onion jam, but I enjoyed their rendition.  + ONION SOUP GRATINEE: We got the basic onion soup (definitely will get all the fixin's next time). All I can say is, if you love cheese, get this soup. I'm salivating just thinking about it. The soup was also very flavorful. The dish is a bit heavy, but that's expected of French onion soup.  + OAK SMOKED DUROC PORK CHOP: I can't resist a good pork chop, especially one that's topped with even more pork (bacon lardons). Loved loved LOVED this entree. The Pork was extremely moist and well -cooked. Topped with the crispiness of the lardons and the crunchiness of the carrots, you have a great balance of flavors as well.",

The food was DELICIOUS. We were big fans of the pastry basket (which you MUST get) and the coffee bar selection. Our entrees were the Bardot Breakfast Sandwich and the American in Paris. Both were amazing, but you definitely can't go wrong ordering any of the other selections. Everything is worth the price. If we do go to Vegas again (which I hope is soon), we will definitely be coming back.",

The menu is vast and allows for lovely choices, all of which are prepared under the influence of French cuisine. I ordered the salmon with brioche which was a souped up French version of the American bagel with lox and cream cheese. In this case, the cream cheese was a lovely herb cream cheese with a brioche bread on the side and fresh smoked salmon. There was a little avocado, small cornichons, tomatoes, and cucumbers. There were also a few slices of red onion. It was delicious. It was also properly proportioned. Prior to that, they did bring a mini French baguette with fresh butter. For my drink, I ordered a spritz with orange pavana... Just lovely. The prices are very reasonable and over all, it is a fabulous experience. I greatly enjoyed this brunch and would not hesitate to come back again.",

    "text": "2 strikes you're out!!!!  Nope not willing to give a third try when it comes to Michael Mina...  As previously reviewed had a bad time at MM in SF.  As for this establishment it pretty much sucked too.  How in the world do these reviewers give 4 or 5 stars????  Maybe they all had colds and their taste buds were malfunctioning...   First let me start that 5 stars to the waiter who dealt with our table.  He is the only great experience I had with this establishment.  Otherwise let me begin (or end) my experience with this restaurant.  After ordering our meal, it took 1 hour and a half to receive our meal.  Suffice to say there was absolutely no excuses.  The restaurant was 1/2 full!!!!  That in itself is really bad.    Now let's not forget the \"forgetful\" appetizers.  The one that most comes to mind is the scallops that is on the tasting menu.  Who in the world serves scallops \"sliced\"? Who serves scallops not seared (besides a sushi restaurant which this is not). Also they were quite chewy....  But worst of all was my main course.... A rib eye steak.  There are many ways to ruin a good cut of meat.  Over or under cook or lack of seasoning.  In my case it was lack of seasoning.  But wait.... the other shoe is about to drop.  Who in the world serves a prime piece of meat by cutting it in half and shoving it together and put's garnish to try to cover it up?!?!?!?  This was an all time low for me.  Shame on MM for opening restaurants to just put his name on it and collect a paycheck.  Doesn't he realize this affects his reputation in the long run?    Never ever again.......",

We had an 11:15 reservation and were told we could have a table that was actually someone's \"regular\" (standing) table if we thought we'd be done by noon... if not we'd have to wait 20 minute. Since one of us had a plane to catch we took the table and said we'd be done in time, and please let the server know so my friend could make her plane. We sat at 11:15 and didn't even get a menu till 11:30, nor did anyone offer any coffee or other beverage. Finally were served at 11:45 and had to rush to eat as well as flag down wait staff to bring coffee- they also never once came by to ask if we needed anything. For the price, the service was poor and this is a recurring theme at Aria. Eternal waits for breakfast, for drinks at the pool. I assume they're understaffed, but for what is supposed to be one of the better hotels they have a long way to go.",

    "text": "This place is one of the many restaurants located inside the Aria hotel on the Vegas strip and it is one of the nicer/fancier places to eat dinner on the strip.  Getting a reservation at this place wasn't too hard, looked it up at 7:30 and we were able to get a reservation for 8:45 and we got there right at our reservation time and were seated promptly.  My friend ordered the pork chops and I had the 1/2 chicken which came with a side of mushroom bread pudding and my friend's pork chops came with a side of mashed potatoes.  I also ordered a side of black truffle fries.  The service was amazing and I could not possibly have any complaints about that.   The portion sizes were also just right in that we weren't left still hungry after finishing our meal nor did we have so much food on our plates that we couldn't finish it.  The food however was only alright.  Based on what we ordered, it seemed to be hit or miss.  The chicken was okay but seemed to be slightly on the saltier side, enough so that I would occasionally have to switch from drinking wine to drinking water just to wash out the salt from my mouth.  The mushroom bread pudding on the other hand was really good and I did not regret having it come as a side with my main dish.  For my friend however, his mashed potatoes weren't too great for him.  He complained that they had a strong taste and that it was so much so that he couldn't even get around to finishing the potatoes.  He had no complaints about the pork chops though.  The black truffle fries were something I highly recommend on this menu though.  They were perfectly cooked, had just the right amount of flavor and unlike my friend's mashed potatoes they were in no way overbearing to eat or taste.  All in all, this place has great service and good portion sizes, a fair sized wine menu, and a decent regular menu.  I would just recommend you ask them to go easy on the salt for the 1/2 chicken and stay away from anything that comes with mashed potatoes as a side.",

It also has Chambord, tempus fugit kina, pineapple, & lemon. Watch out, as it can be quite addictive!  And wow, that Parisian Gnocchi! The gnocchi were perfectly crisp on the outside and pillowy soft inside. Add in sauteed black trumpet mushrooms, creamy chevre, celery root (which I'm normally not crazy about, but was done quite well here), and tasty roasted garlic cream, and I was in \"gnocchi nirvana\".  I had a wonderful bar side experience at Bardot last week. Perhaps next time, I'll grab a booth and taste what else this latest Michael Mina hotspot has to offer.",

The frisee salad with egg and bacon got rave reviews and the Bardot salad with Dijon vinaigrette and radishes was light and refreshing.   Order a side of Mac and cheese! Noodles were oddly stacked on end (I feel bad for whoever has that job in kitchen prep) but the gruyere cheese was creamy on one side and and the noodles had a salty, crispy crust on the other. I ate most of it before my dining companions could try it.   The burger was really good. Mine was cooked well without being dry. Seared crispy on the outside with cheese and tart onions, watercress and garlic aioli. The fries were perfectly cooked and salted.  The herb gnocchi were great with a cream sauce. The skate got rave reviews too.   I'd certainly recommend this restaurant. We had some service issues with the bill getting rung up incorrectly but I'd give them another chance for sure.",

All the dishes we ordered was fantastic.  1)We love the escargot here, it's the best so far, although it's only 4 small ones, each bit was awesome, you can completely enjoy the escargot in your mouth.  2) French onion soup was very flavorful. We love how rich the cheese on top but not heavy. The soup contained onions and toasts. Good combination  3) chicken French dip was amazing. The dipping was rich but not heavy. We had beef French dip before, but this one was very creative  4) smoked salmon croissant Benedict. The poached egg was good.   Service was not as good. Not as attentive.   Overall, good experience for brunch.",

    "text": "Like most American restaurants claiming to be French this or that, you basically just hope the bread is good.  The bread was good, as was everything else.  Started with the cheese plate, all three selections recommend by the waitress were unique, complex and delicious.  We ordered cocktails, which were fresh and strong.  The black truffle fries could use a little more black truffle than the light dusting they get, but it's a good amount for a side order.  For entrees we shared the pork chop and the gnocchi.  While the pork chop, vegetables and mashed potatoes were cooked perfectly, the mustard topping sauce was a bit boring but good.  The gnocchi was the best I've had; the black trumpet mushrooms give the dish a smokey, meaty flavor.  For dessert we had the strawberry pavlova, which was a perfect light finish.  The lavender gelato and strawberries provide plenty of flavor without being too overwhelming.  (Note that the meringue in a pavlova is crispy.)",

    "text": "As someone with zero skill or luck when it comes to gambling, It's great knowing you don't have to roll the dice to find exquisite dining in Las Vegas. For no particular reason I hadn't been back to Vegas in nearly two years. While maybe not the newest, my wife and I had been hearing consistently great things about BARDOT Brasserie so we made a point of getting reservations for her B-day dinner.  Located within Aria, we went with a small group of friends and met up at the restaurant right around our reservation time. It took a few minutes before we got seated, but once inside the first thing one notices is how the place is dimly lit and full or tile, dark wood and brass. Deservingly a brasserie.  While on the pricier side, there are certainly pricier still in Vegas. As one would expect the menu is decidedly French. No need to try and reinvent the wheel here as the majority of menu options are relatively timeless.  While wine would definitely be on the table for dinner, we started things off with cocktails. Preferring alcohol-forward, I ordered the Smoke & Mirrors while my wife got the Snake In The Grass.  Both were excellent. Looking to try a little of everything we also ordered the charcuterie board, which came packed with pate, rillettes and other cured meats.  Main course had to be steak - 8oz Angus Filet Mignon, medium rare. A friend of ours ordered the same thing, medium. As with most fine dining experiences we had some time before the meals came out. Everything looked great and we dug right in. While the meat was what one would expect from a proper filet mignon, for a roughly $50 item, it didn't seem medium rare as we would have liked.   About halfway through the meal we look over at our friend who'd ordered hers medium and noticed it was far pinker than our own. At that point we realized they had given us the wrong plates. I brought this up with the waiter next time they came by. While our friend who had ordered the medium learned then and there that she preferred medium rare, our server asked as flat out if we'd like another one. I actually felt bad, but yes, the medium wasn't doing the trick and we obliged.   The new steak came out soon enough, and was indeed, perfectly medium rare. It cut like butter and melted in my mouth. I also then understood why this place gets such high marks to begin with. The food was great. And while they may have slipped up an expensive order, they also fixed it with poise and speed. That's how it's done.",

The FOOD is another story.  The snails were incased in a doughy pastry.  The solution was to take the snails out of the dough and eat them without it.  The steak tartare was not a traditional and tasted more like a chopped meat with salad dressing.  We could not eat it, and send it back.   The King Crab and Endive came with plenty of Endive but very little king crab with a preponderance of  parmesan cheese.  I found it inedible and did not eat it. We ended up eating the small baguette with a very tasty butter, and ordering a second round of drinks.",

Our party of four opted for the $25 bottomless Rose which got us right back in the Vegas spirit.   For food, we started by sharing a Nutella sticky bun which hit our sweet spot. For the entree two of us had the French toast and two had Eggs Benedict. Both were great, but one 'loaf' of French toast is more than enough for a party of four.  Ask for Tish!

The decor is beautiful and it's a very intimate restaurant.  The service is always fantastic - I prefer to go sit at the bar during happy hour because they have great specials, but sitting in the dining room is just as great. Plus, 2 words: CHAMPAGNE CART!! Don't miss out this! During brunch they offer $20 bottomless rose, which is just crazy!   The Le Steakburger is really good, but I think my favorite dish has been the roasted chicken french dip....it's really good! I definitely suggest checking out Bardot, they have a lot to offer!",

We've been visiting here ever since they opened when they replaced the previous restaurant American Fish. Brunch, lunch or dinner I've tried it all. For brunch the Hunter's Waffle and french toast is absolutely delightful. The French toast though is quite large but pleasantly so. I recommend sharing. The regular lunch menu is very reduced. Dinner has some interesting dishes and their famous lobster pot pie. There's absolutely nothing I can complain about besides the infrequent consistency in the preparation of certain dishes which is mainly a problem with dinner.",

Service was a bit slow considering the restaurant was not very full, but servers were very friendly. Food was beautifully plated, but heavily salted. If you're in aria for lunch or dinner, I'd recommend Herringbone instead.",

I didn't eat much of the complimentary bread (they serve it Parisian style, in the paper still), but it was tasty. I had a Bloody Mary which was also spicy and not too watery (no bueno when there's too much ice in it, which this one didn't have). The place was pretty empty, maybe because there's no actual brunch menu (only applies on weekends apparently). It does have a Paris feel to it, with the decor and architecture of the restaurant, so I liked it. Good to know you also can take the Aria shuttle to get to Bellagio from here afterwards (free).",

    "text": "As a pick for dinner from my Brother, we gathered our hungry appetites and walked through the doors of Bardot for culinary satisfaction.  Dishes tried: - Duck wings - Foie Gras - Frese Salad - Kobe bone marrow - Onion Soup - Escargo - Mac and Cheese - Beef Wellington - Sirloin Steak  I have a healthy appetite, but this was a meal that was shared amongst six hungry adults.  The meal starts with some amazing fresh baked bread, I am a simple guy and bread and butter does not get as simple or delish as this.  The baguette is crisp yet fluffy on the inside.  Standout Apps: - Escargo - Frese Salad - Onion Soup  The least favorite of the apps turned out to be the duck wings, they had too much zest for our taste and not enough flavor.  I felt the jam on top of the foie gras was too sweet and did not contrast well with the foie gras itself.  I had to sprinkle in some salt to offset the sweetness.    My favorite dish was the Beef Wellington because it was cooked and seasoned to absolute precision by the team at Bardot.  The puff pastry was perfectly crisp and the beef to an even higher echelon of medium rare. Be prepared to pay for this work of culinary art as it took a big chunk of the final receipt.  I can't forget to mention the mac and cheese because of the preparation. If i could have I would have paid to go back to see the chef whose duty it is to align each individual piece of macaroni to stand up for this dish.    I hate to call this out, but the cheesy restaurant photography and option to buy your photo weighed on me while I dined.  I get this is a good added revenue stream for Bardot, but it does cheapen the fine dining experience in my opinion.  Everything else from the hostess, staff, and kitchen prep was outstanding.",

I stayed at the Aria for a conference and am so grateful that Bardot was here!  If you come during happy hour the price of the drinks plus the complementary baguette and butter (which is delicious) make it all worth it.  For dinner I had the pork chop and it was well worth it! Glistening white, perfectly cooked and plenty flavorful, I was very impressed by my meal. 5 stars!",

Our server Oscar brought the champagne perfectly chilled just as we realized we wanted it. We asked him to speak to the sommelier about food pairings, and guess what? Oscar *was* the sommelier. He recommended incredible pairings (including off-menu customizations) worthy of the wine we had brought-- our meal was perfectly paced, the food was flawless, and our flaming Baked Alaska dessert pairing put on quite a show for all our dining companions! I can't wait to return.",

    "text": "Bardot is beautiful. The food is fantastic. Go there wearing your fat pants. The end.  Okay, so obviously reviews need a bit more detail but that's the gist of it. Bardot stands out in a city overwhelmed with French restaurants both on- and off-Strip. It's great for a business meal, a date night, a special event, or even just sitting at the bar for dessert to treat yourself. So far my visits have been limited to a networking event with passed appetizers and seafood and a group brunch, but I'll definitely be back for dinner soon.  Standouts include their cheese (duh), charcuterie, fresh oysters, escargot, and any incarnation of terrine or foie gras. I'm sure their entrees are great, but I'd go wild with multiple appetizers instead. My next visit will include the beef tartare and onion soup for sure.  You can't go wrong with their brunch options. Mussels have a great, complex broth and a massive mountain of a portion. The giant French toast is amazingly light with a great vanilla mascarpone and the world's fanciest granola bar garnish. The Hunter's Waffle with duck confit was a nice balance of sweet and savory. It took all of my self control not to run off with Cint B's Short Rib Croissant Benedict.    Just go, tout de suite.",

Not rubber at all or chewy. Their iced frappe is stellar beyond stellar.  Their beet salad was heaven. Absolute heaven. I could have eaten 12 plates. And their steak is sublime. I wanted to lick the plate.  My highlight was my beautiful chocolate macaroon. My giant macaron. Which was all for me and I didn't want to share. I like my macaroons the way I like my men. Dark, rich, velvety, and black. Lord have mercy.   You must come here and enjoy your life and make sure you do the bottomless rose too. Xoxo.",

When God created the greatest waiter on Earth, he made him of French Lebanese descent and he sprung out from the Cote d'ivoire.  This place replaced the missed American Fish, another Michael Mina spot.  This haunt is Mina's take on French food (greatest in the world).  The bar itself is worth in the millions.  No penny was spared creating this place and Michael's wife can be seen here every so often.  All salads and soups are solid orders.  Many of the apps are near top notch.  But what anyone cares about are the main courses.  The flank steak is ELITE.  The ribeye and all other steaks I have eaten all rate a 8 or more out of 10.  The sides are a bit too small for sharing for more than two people.  The mushrooms side is more of a pastry than a mushroom dish  Asparagus and brussel sprouts sides are really good, totally French style.  Fish dishes all rate a 8 out of 10. I had the cod, salmon and sea bass and to me reverse the order I just stated for taste and quality.  All deserts are high end.  I recommend the banana desert.  All cocktails are of high quality and all have a special flare to them.  Heck, all the dudes behind the bar are friendly, ready to serve, want to talk to you and have no heirs.",

But they were just ok. Charcuterie Board was solid--loved the rillette. But I was ALL ABOUT THE FOIE GRAS PARFAIT! So wonderfully smooth and somehow rich and light at the same time. The port gelee added the perfect acidity to it.  For entrees, seester and I split:  -Oak Smoked Duroc Pork Chop with Crispy Lardons -Alaskan Cod with a Saffron Beurre Blanc  The pork was very juicy and the lardons were decadent. The horseradish was fantastic with it. The cod was light, flaky and I loved the corn.   But beware....if you love wine--bring your $$$$$$  The cheapest bottle was around $150 and I kid you not, we saw a bottle that was listed for $38K---no joke!  Overall, I really enjoyed the dinner but it was VERY pricey especially if you order booze.",

Ambience 5: welcoming lounge filled with lively guests laughing and chatting while sipping at their drinks ... wowed when I was led to their oh so inviting dining room ... finishing were the more casually dressed and gatherings of families with young children from early seatings ... very popular place for big parties ... and, when the night moved on, stylishly dressed guests swaggered in!  Service 3.5: warm, funny, and personable was our waiter ... was rushed in finishing the first shared appetizer before having the second appetizer appeared, the table top just can't fit both plates; otherwise, the pacing was perfect the rest of the evening ... sommelier came to table at the start but never came back after I had decided what my entree to be as requested!  Food 3.75: their bone marrow with red wine onion jam AND their generous portion of seared foie gras were delicious ... I loved their warm beets & goat cheese tossed in a fantastic vinaigrette ... unfortunately, their lamb crown roast was a total disappointment - turned off I was with how much fat was left on the lamb!  Instead of dinner reservations next time, I'll be back at Bardot's lounge for their signature cocktails and bubblies with an hors d'oerves or two!  Cheers!",

Not only did he make us feel right at home, by treating us as if we were lifelong pals, he also asked us about our dinner plans and pointed us in the direction of Carbone, which was right across the way and did not disappoint.

    "text": "The Bardot Brasserie at The Aria is a French cuisine restaurant in a tribute to the classic Parisian brasserie at its finest! The dishes here are amazing!  For starters, I had the King Crab Crepe, together with Black trumpet mushrooms, sunny-side egg, normandic cider beurre blanc. Where have you ever had a crepe prepared like this? Anywhere? Except maybe in France? All of the ingredients were blended beautifully to perfection!   My main entree was the King Salmon Aux Lentilles, an organic Scottish salmon, beluga lentils, smoked tomato vinaigrette. Another perfect dish, indeed! The salmon was seared on the outside so the salmon skin was crunchy! After searing the outside, chef baked the salmon just enough, but leaving enough of the inside undercooked, making for another beautifully inspired dish!  For dessert, I had the Frozen Paris Brest, hazelnut ice cream, chocolate cremieux, and salted caramel. Lily, while preparing the utensils for my dessert, provided me not only with a spoon, but also a fork and knife! I jokingly asked, wow, do I really need a knife for my dessert? She laughed! When I got my dessert, yes, I'll need my knife! LOL. The dessert was actually 6 separate ice cream sandwiches craftfully connected together! It was like eating 6 ice cream sandwiches!  Props to my server Lily, who was warm and inviting through my journey through this whole experience! I will never forget her, and be sure to make a return visit here with other friends, if not on this trip, for sure in the future!  The restaurant was very elegant, high end and high class! The dishes are pricey, but hey, you get what you pay for! Right? There are flat screen TVs at the bar to make for more \"casual\" feel! It's a good thing we had an early dinner, 6:30, because by 7:00pm the place started to fill quickly! The whole experience here makes for my 5-star review to go with the 5-star dishes and 5-star experience! Special props to Chef Joshua Smith, under the tuitiledge of James Beard award winning chef Michael Mina! An unforgettable experience indeed! French cuisine at its finest!",

I love cognac and wanted to try something different than my regular Remy. He suggested the Guillon Painturaud Hors d'Age Cognac, which was amazing great price for such an amazing taste. They have a large list of cognac and I loved it.  We started with the duck l'orange and king crab crepe. Wow. the duck was wonderful. I loved the crepe but not so much my wife. The onion soup was good but the best was the pork chop. The mac and cheese another tasty one. OMG yummy.   We recommend this place if you love great food. Oh and on a side note we saw Antonio Esfandiari , Poker, come in and sit about three tables away. Nice.",

The hostess was very accommodating and happily moved it back with no issue.   By the time we arrived, we were seated very quickly and already placed our orders within 15 mins of our arrival. They also provided 2 warm, baked baguettes that were very tasty with a side of salted butter. My friends thought the bread was so good, they almpst ate all of it before our main courses.   We ordered quite few dishes, 2 chicken plates, 1 lamb plate, 1 scallop playe, and 1 salmon plate, and 1 order of black truffle fries. We all shared a few bits and piece in order to enjoy everything we ordered. The scallops were very delicious, crispy sear on the outside and soft on the inside. The salmon plate was cooked at medium and I absolutely loved it. The chicken was very juicy and had a lot of flavor. The lamb was also delicious, it had a very light flavor in the center of the meat, but the seared portion had a wonderful taste.  Overall, the service and food was delicious. We will definitely return on our next visit to Vegas!",

Well, the decor is very well designed, the service by Shannon very friendly and that's where the similarity ends. My wife's omelette seemed to come out of a pan of pre-made rolls, my lobster tasted somewhat blend, no home made sauce to accompany the dishes. So we were disappointed by the lack of culinary research and the wine glasses at $18 seem to be somewhat overpriced. Oh but we were in Las Vegas where everything is \"oversized\"!. chef Mina, you have a little way to go to reach the quality we were expecting for that price range.",

The service is on point, the food quality is FANTASTIC, and I have not ever had anything but great times when dining there. In my experience, it's one of the more understated Michael Mina restaurants, but it is most definitely one of my favorites. I have frequented many others in Las Vegas and San Francisco and this is easily top 5 on my list.   Additionally, Bardot has a really elegant bar overflowing with tempting libations. All of your classic favorites are available, and a few that may be new for you to check out -  My recent favorite has been the MAN ABOUT TOWN: it's Rittenhouse rye, rooibos infused campari, and carpano antica sweet vermouth.. it's so elegant and satisfying. If that's not your thing, they have a mean wine list, ready to pair with your dining experience.   On the dinner menu - Like so many others have said, I cannot get away from the FOIE GRAS PARFAIT. It's so good, so decadent, so 'just right'. It is literally one of my favorite things on any menu in Las Vegas. So simple and delicious. It makes me happy every time I get a chance to enjoy it. I have also sampled their selection of very fresh OYSTERS, the crispy and elegant ESCARGOTS BARDOT, their KING CRAB CREPE, and their excellent WARM BEETS & CARAMELIZED GOAT CHEESE salad. Most recently, the classic style PATE de CAMPAGNE made it's way to our table, and was absolutely perfect. I am a fan for sure.   On one particular visit, my whole meal consisted of just starters and dessert and it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in Las Vegas!  For the main course, the LAMB RACK \"FRITES\" is probably my favorite dish. It's designed to be shared for two and is a really beautiful and classic presentation of rack of lamb. As well, I have loved the OAK-SMOKED DUROC PORK CHOP, but one of my all-time favorites is a well prepared LOUP DE MER. Also known as a Mediterranean sea bass, Bardot prepares theirs grilled, with caramelized lemon, fennel, and steamed potatoes. Too right!  In every case.. every meal..  perfect.   Needless to say, if you ever have the opportunity to give Bardot Brasserie a chance.. please do. I haven't even touched on their amazing desserts and after dinner embellishments. This is a place to be savored and enjoyed. Check it out.  Happy Eating!",

I told my boyfriend I didn't think I had ever been so happy in my life. They have a great selection of French and American breakfast lunch and dinner options. All kinds of coffee and champagne or cocktails. The ambiance is perfect, I thought about moving in. It's such a cute place and everyone is super nice and friendly. My boyfriend had the quiche which was rich but excellent. Will definitely come back whenever in Vegas!",

Wife's lobster bisque had no chunks of lobster like at the Brio, which we use as a comparison since it is very good. Her pork chop was flovarless.  My steak arrived cold but tasted good, excpet the red wine bordelaise was bland but horse radish one was good.  Daughter said her fish tasted good otherwise might have been a lower rating since our waitress was slow. We were falling asleep waiting for the desert menu which didnt really jump at you for choices. What is with them not having coffee on that menu. You would tjink they'd at least have French stlye coffee. Next time we will stick with the Effiel Tower French restaurant or maybe try another French one as we are looking for second French one if Effiel is packed.",

My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the endive, walnut, and blue cheese salad and the French onion soup.   The salad was delicious. It had the right amount of watercress and vinaigrette to complement the main ingredients.  My soup wasn't too salty, as I've noticed some French onion soups to be. I tasted my boyfriend's dish and it was light with not too much sauce.   I also had the De Peche Mode cocktail. I forget exactly what was in it but I think it had chamomile, honey, whiskey?, peach something or other, and a sprig of thyme. It was pretty strong, I was impressed.   Overall great experience. Loved the decor and ambiance. Staff was attentive and professional. The noise level was pretty bad though. People talking loudly over the music which you could barely hear.",

    "text": "If I could give SIX stars I would do so.  We stopped by earlier to confirm that we wanted to spend our anniversary evening at Bardot and upon inquiring about a particular dish that we love there from past experiences, we discovered that it was served only for brunches, not dinners.   We thought that was that.  But the front hostess actually called out a server to discuss the item with us to confirm that we were speaking about the same item.  We made the reservation.  Upon arrival in the evening, we were promptly seated.   We were properly greeted and taken care of.  I ordered a rib eye steak but it came out overcooked a bit.  But at the luxary price that I paid for it, I returned it to the kitchen and asked for the lamb chops.   The manager, Mr. Anthony Carideo - general manager - came to my table and in one of the most excellent exhibitions of proper customer care, was nice, communicative, not overly drippingly fake, and admitted fault - immediately - \"it was overcooked - I looked at it and it was cooked medium well\" (I ordered medium).   We chatted a bit about life, and he appropriately moved on.  The chops arrived and as the rest of the food, including my wife's and our other dishes, and drinks, they were excellent - fantastic.  But wait.  The best was last.  At the conclusion of the meal, they brought to us THE SPECIAL DISH that we wanted so much that is not normally made for dinners.  It is a like a fruit/yogurty type of a tray.  We were happily surprised.  We also had our photos professionally taken there and bought the photo.  Thanks Bardot - you were the BEST part of our Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Wife and I had an early dinner at Bardot before seeing Zarkana (The Circus de Soleil show at Aria.). The Zarkana theater is right next door to this restaurant. The food was very good and prices reasonable (OK...I did pay $60 for my petite filet. But it was one of the best steaks I've ever had!) Let's start with the bread-freshly made baguettes. Bardot makes its own baguettes every morning and they're great. We shared a crab crepe for an appetizer. It was very creative with a sunnyside-up fried egg, chunks of crab, spinach and garnished with green apples on a whole wheat tortilla. I had steak frites (a petite filet) and my wife had a cod fish entree. The cod was somewhat bland, but the cut of fish was very good. Here's my basic breakdown of Bardot:  1. Food: B+ (I don't believe in grade inflation; so the food really was quite good eventhough my wife's entree could have been better.  2. Waite Staff: B+  Our waiter was a little cold, but very efficient and professional. We told our waiter that we only had 1 1/2 hours for dinner because of our theater tickets. No problem. We were easily served within that time and got to our theater seats 5 minutes before show time. Perfect.  3. Ambiance: A-  This restaurant has a beautiful bar. It's generally a quiet restaurant with the tables spaced far enough apart so you don't have to be an unwilling listener to the next table's gossip.  4. Presentation of Food: B  Nothing too over-the-top  5. Table Setting: C  This is my biggest complaint of Bardot's. The tables were marble with very little on them. The tableware, china, etc. did not seem on a par with a restaurant of this caliber. The table setting was quite cold. But this is a very minor point and shouldn't stop you from eating at this wonderful restaurant.  Highly recommend this restaurant. We'll be back.",

Whenever I have a poor experience at a restaurant that consistently gets 4 and 5 star reviews I always want to go back and give them a second chance. My second visit to Bardot was extraordinary.   We decided to try Sunday brunch this time and it was packed full. Service however was excellent from the time we sat down until we left completely stuffed. We started with peach bellini's and that wonderful pastry basket filled with light delicious pastries that will make you think you are in Paris.   Our table shared the king crab crepe which was presented beautifully. It was served open faced with the perfectly cooked egg in the center of the dark buckwheat crepe. When you mix the egg, crepe, king crab and mushrooms together it is a rich and elegant way to start your brunch.   We also enjoyed the Le steak burger, hunters waffle and the french toast. The steak burger was excellent, cooked perfectly medium rare and the hunters waffle was an interesting mix of duck confit and poached eggs served on a waffle. Now...for that french toast.   You have never seen anything like it. It is HUGE. A super thick slice of brioche with a giant scoop of vanilla marscapone and two large pieces of almond brittle. Stunning when placed on the table but even better in your mouth! The almond syrup is a perfect match. The outside of the toast is crispy and the inside soft and warm. This is a must order item.   The food and service was worthy of all their 4 and 5 star reviews. I am really glad we came back to Bardot and it definitely won't be our last time.",

    "text": "Came here for my birthday not to long ago after dropping hints that this is where I wanted to come.  Located at the Aria you already knew this place was going to be a step above the majority of the restaurants on the strip. Gorgeous modern and nostalgic decor is noticed as soon as you walk onto the marble floor and into this eclectic brasserie.    It was a very busy night but we were seated immediately due to the fact that we had reservations. Definitely not a great place for a first date or a romantic evening, as the seats are rather Close together. Great for a night out with friends in town or to celebrate something special.  Started off with the French onion soup and the steak tartar. Onion soup was phenomenal. Large portion with excellent flavor. Caramelized onions with a generous helping of brioche style bread in a decadent beef broth. The cheese on top was melted to a golden brown. 5/5 Steak tartar.... wow enough said. Topped off with a quail egg and seved with row of crosscut chips. Seasoned beautifully it had a crisp and refreshing taste. 5/5.  Next was the scallops and fillet. Fillet was very tender and juicy. Standard fillet. Seasoned ok, salt and pepper. 4/5. Scallops were succulent and cooked perfectly as to not dry out. 5/5  Ended the night with the baked Alaska. Amazing table side flambe presentation but all in all a 3:5. Nothing spectacular.   Great atmosphere, pretty good service and amazing food make for a great combo here.",

The croissant Benedicts are so freshly made and the croissants and perfectly flaky and delicious and the eggs were beautifully poached and runny. We made reservations so I recommend you do the same!

    "text": "Our group was really dissapointed with our recent experience here.  We are locals and suggested this restaurant for dinner to accompany out of town guests as we have had brunch here on a number of occasions with great results. Unfortunately,  our dinner failed to impress in some areas.  Firstly, the good; the food was outstanding.  The menu has a good scope of few, but great options to supply exciting dishes for a multiple coursed dinner.  The drink and wine menu is superb.  Some may find it lacking in less expensive wine options, but this should be expected from a restaurant such as this on the strip.  The restaurant itself is also very attractive.  With that said, our issues were directly related to staff and service.  There was just an overall lack of friendliness or welcoming from anyone really.  Our server was clearly, with no doubts, annoyed by our presence.  There was a lack of overall attentiveness and also a clear feeling of being rushed out to move us on.  I assume this was because we hadnt ordered $300 bottles of wine like the table adjacent immediately upon seating.  We would have loved to have enjoyed multiple drinks however our glasses were prompltly cleared after our first round with no offer for anything more until something was said 20 minutes later by a member of our party.  Even the hostess upon departure said nothing at all.  It was also uncomfortably warm in the restaurant.  We shortened our evening and left the property promptly.  All this said, even with fantastic food and a beautiful restaurant, the service truly can be the degrading factor of the overall experience.  Locals, I recommend elsewhere.  There are too many great restaurants off the strip anymore to pay strip prices for extremely lackadaisical  experiences anyways.",

Started out with Foie Gras Parfait, charcuterie board (try the grey stuff, it's delicious!), and cheese plate with the Comte, Mimolette Vielle, and Couronne de Fontenay. The Couronne pairs really well with the jam which is sweet, fruity, and floral.  The food was fabulous. We had the Beef Wellington, Scallops Veronique, and the rack of lamb. C'est magnifique!  Dessert was the chocolate macaron (so delicious), Mille feuille (meh bc I'm not a fan of the goat cheese here), and the baked Alaska which gets covered in rum and lit on fire.   Lovely interior and great French food made for a memorable evening.",

Recently, 6 of us gathered here for dinner with Chef Josh Smith demonstrating once again why this is the best French food in Las Vegas and beyond.  Standouts were the Beef Wellington--a masterpiece of rare beef surrounded by mushroom duxelles and a flaky pasty, the endive and bleu cheese salad (refreshing and plated in a very pleasing fashion), the scallops, and the duck breast.  I have left out some of the other items but the whole meal was outstanding.    Desserts are a must.  The espresso creme brulee was so different and having the Baked Alaska once again is a show both for your eyes and your taste buds.  Service is always excellent.  Walking away having eaten too much but feeling very good, I was thinking about when next to return.  Kudos to Chef Smith and his staff!",

The house choice of red wine, a pinot noir that evening was lovely and a decent pour for the $7-8 price. I enjoyed the fact our bartender was making sure anyone who wanted refills got them before the 7 pm cut off point. The HH menu is varied with petite portions, minus the Charcuterie Board, which, is larger, and a steal for $17. The menu items we received were delicious and made with love. You could easily make a meal out of two-three choices. If you are staying at the Aria or close by and want to dine on a budget, I highly recommend these folks between the hours of 5-7pm.",

It melts in your mouth and is accompanied with a very tasteful almond syrup concoction. This is all made even better by a light almond brittle that comes with it.  I split the above French toast and a croissant Benedict with the short rib. Adds a little more substance to your breakfast and has some fantastic flavor.   What could make this better? Why a bottomless rose to start your Vegas day off right.  Finally, a shout out to our server Tish! The entire experience was made even better by her attention to detail and infectious personality.

    "text": "Top notch classy place in Aria.  I was here on a weekday for lunch with my husband, as work brought him to Vegas for the week. We had our 13 month old with us, and I instantly was nervous because walking in it was clear that the restaurant is posh and probably not keen on having babies in the dining room.  Luckily, it was pretty empty, and doubly lucky, my son was an angel and didn't throw any food! Our server was super professional and nice, and gave us lots of good recommendations on food and wine pairings. Hubby's coworker was dying to try escargot, and he said they were good, but he was disappointed that they weren't prepared classically.   French onion soup- I LOVE me a good onion soup covered in that melty cheesy goodness. This soup was good, but not too memorable.   Lobster bisque- Hubby ordered this, and he's not really a soup guy, or a rich thick food guy either, so I was surprised he ordered it. I thought it was good, it had a strong lobster flavor to it which was nice since usually you can't taste it.  World's best butter- the guy we were with ordered this, as he's never had French food before and wanted to go all out. You spread it on the bread, then sprinkle some sea salt on top. It was pretty tasty, I have to say, but their regular bread and butter was just fine to me too.  Chicken cordon bleu- Delicious! I've never had this dish before but I've always wanted to try it, and it was really yummy. Prepared perfectly, it had a nice crunch but the chicken inside was still juicy and moist. My baby loved it!  Steak frites- the two guys ordered this. The steak was great, prepared nicely, and their fries were delicious.  Overall, we had a very lovely, pleasant lunch here. Yes it's pricey, but the food was really good and I'd say worth the price. The restaurant space is gorgeous, and our service was top notch!",

The buckwheat crepe with crab was the best part of the meal - fresh tasting and overall a pretty decent dish. Service was just ok. Way better french food options in town elsewhere.",

We had the La Boulangerie starter, which comes with 4 pastries, (2 croissants, 1 raisin sweet roll and 1 other danish). I had a bite of the raisin danish and croissant, both of which were good. They also brought out two baguette loaves, but I didn't have any, as I didn't want to fill up on any more bread.   For the main course, I ordered the french toast. My jaw dropped when I saw the size of this dish. I wasn't super hungry, so I knew there was no way I was going to be able to finish. That being said, it was one of the best french toast dishes I've had. The brioche just melted in my mouth with every bite. I barely even needed any of the mascarpone or syrup. Unfortunately, I was only able to eat about half of it. I skipped the almond brittle, as I'm not a fan of brittle in general. Others at my table enjoyed it however.    I also ordered the double cut bacon and was not a huge fan. I admit, I had no idea on how thick it would be, as it was much thicker than I was expecting. I'll stick to the old fashioned thin and crispy version in the future.   The service was a bit slow on the water and unlimited champagne refills. Except for the bacon, everyone in my group enjoyed their meals.",

Food was all right - nothing we ordered - onion soup, lobster bisque, double cut ribeye, or mouses frites was a standout, but not bad either. Hoping they keep improving as concept is great.",

    "text": "I was sad to see Michael Mina's American Fish close, but was more than assuaged after eating at Bardot.   The restaurant is beautiful--completely redone to go with the French brasserie theme with plenty of painted wood paneling, brass, Mercury glass, and detailing. All those hard surfaces result in a super noisy restaurant, but it's pretty to look at!  Bardot is open for brunch 10:00-2:00 on the weekends only, and dinner every day at 5:00. They offer happy hour with food and drink specials each night til 7:00 in the bar.   Loved the smoke and mirrors cocktail, with the sweet balanced out by the smoke.   My favorite thing, which was ordered as an afterthought, was the beet salad. A beautiful presentation, and it's even tastier than it looks. Lightly grilled goat cheese, hazelnut oil...mmmm.   Pretty restaurant, pretty food, pretty people...must be Vegas!",

The location is another wonderful benefit. BARDOT is centrally located but not hammered with noisy and/or annoying foot traffic. The setting is right out of a romantic movie set in the City of Lights.  The Mina Group is well known for hiring the well and solid, ongoing training. This is evidenced by a staff that actually look and feel like they enjoy what they do. The management are what you can expect from such a strong brand(s) - excellent, personable and superb at anticipating needs and wants.  Each dish, as with the hand-crafted cocktails, was thoughtful, sensational and flavorful. BARDOT ranks among my favorite places in Las Vegas. Your expectations will be exceeded and you will have a fun time to boot!",

Everything was great! We sat at the bar each time and the service was impeccable. We were so impressed by both Eric and Brooke!  They are the kind of bartenders that can provide professional service while chatting with each and every customer - and always with a smile! A thank you goes out to Alex too for remembering each time not to put ice in my water. Thanks for a great experience! p.s We loved the Tartare and each of the Tartines but my all time favorite was....And God Created Woman - a perfect cocktail! yum",

    "text": "Splendid! My boyfriend and I came here back in September on sort of a last minute dinner decision, after we napped a bit too late (as one does in Vegas after a Saturday by the pool). We booked the last reservation of the evening at Bardot, somewhere around 10pm.   Hidden in the beautiful Aria, Bardot is a little Parisian delight! We were seated cordially at a candlelit table in the emptying bistro. The decor was adorable, the bar incredibly beautiful, and the service impeccable!  We started with wine, and found the perfect glasses per the expertise of our waiter. We decided on what I imagine to have been a seasonal appetizer at the time-- burrata with fresh stone fruit and seasonal squash. Positively scrumptious! Very refreshing, light, and an incredible blend of flavors.  We moved on to dinner, and ordered the 14oz ribeye to share and the blistered green beans to pair. Our steak and frites came out split  in advance, a very sweet gesture by the chef as well as our servers! We surely appreciated not having to awkwardly slice and section off a steak, which would surely crowd the table. We had eaten at multiple steakhouses in Vegas on our trip, and it was certain to both of us that Bardot's ribeye was the most flavorful cut with beautiful marbling. They served us the freshest, most raw horseradish per our request-- a rarity to get it so perfectly raw! The green beans with lemon and almonds were a wonderful touch to our meal that was splendid to begin with.  After dinner, the professional photographer (I believe her name was Brittany?) came along to offer us portraits, to which we happily obliged. She was an absolute sweetheart with a creative eye. We left Bardot satiated with a delightful meal with wonderful service as well as beautiful portraits we will surely cherish to remember the evening!",

    "text": "**FANTASTIC DINNER IN LAS VEGAS**  ABOUT ====== Classic French brasserie experience offering traditional brasserie fare by Michael Mina. Located inside the Aria.  AMBIANCE ========= Feels of dining at a Parisian cafe but with a modern craft kitchen. Dressy casual.  FOOD ===== FOIE GRAS PARFAIT - $18 Ruby port gelee with grilled country bread was the highlight of the meal. Beautiful and high quality. The fluffy taste is unbelievably good. Can't stop thinking about it and came back the next day for it. RATING: 5/5  ESCARGOTS BARDOT - $18 These wild burgundy snails with toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse garlic butter and puff pastry shells were surprisingly different and wonderfully delicious. RATING: 4.5/5  BONE MARROW AU POIVRE - $17 The peppercorn-crusted bone marrow with burgundy onion jam and a side of grilled country bread was OK. Not as fatty and scrumptious as I would like. RATING: 3.5/5  MUSSELS MARINIERES* 29 These Prince Edward island mussels, in garlic butter, dolin vermouth,  and tarragon were juicy and tasty. The warm baguettes came in handy for the broth. RATING: 4/5  MACARONI & MIMOLETTE GRATINEE - $13 My least favorite dish. Not as traditional American as I would like, but it's French, so I get it.  Not gooey. A bit on the dry side. RATING: 3/5  DESSERTS - $13 each ========= MILLE FEUILLE My favorite! Caramelized puff pastry layered with vanilla creme patissiere. Classic and excellent. RATING: 5/5  CHOCOLATE MACARON French chocolate cookie with Valrhona chocolate mousse can be shared. It's big and very chocolatey. RATING: 4/5  CREME BRULEE Vanilla bean custard and turbinado croquant were OK. Wasn't the best I've had, but solid. RATING: 3.5/5  BEVERAGE - ~$15 ========= CLASSIC VODKA MARTINI Done perfectly, thank you. RATING: 5/5  APEROL SPRITZ Also done perfectly. RATING: 5/5  PRO TIP ====== Look into their Everlasting Rose during brunch for $20 (Saturday & Sunday | 10:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.) Heard their Nutella Sticky Bun, Croissant Benedicts, and Hunter's Waffle were killers.  OVERALL ======== One of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas. Good for groups and dates.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

I had the parisian gnocchi which was the best I ever had. This place has the most creative and delicious sides. Their macaroni and cheese is truly unique, picture attached. We also tried their chick pea frites with eggplant caviar, so delicious!! Wine selection is very good, they have wines from all over the world. However full you are, dessert is a must try.

Great experience and amazing service form all the staff and managers. Bardot food and signature cocktails for sure are meant to be remembered.   We started with the Escargot Bardot which was so delicious that you don't want to stop eating!  It's a puff pastry made to perfection!  Foie Gras Parfait....wow!!! I'm not a huge fan of Foie Gras, but this was so good I seriously could not have enough. I'm sure my dinner partner was not happy since he loves it and I usually let him eat it all... Not this time!  It's a ruby port gelee and grilled country bread.  Another must have ! Duck A L'Orange- ( duck wings)  grilled wings, blood orange , sauce maltaise. cooked perfectly and just enough to keep you happy.   Charcuterie Board- it's super delicious and definitely a good dish to order if you have kids or picky eaters.  Looks like a flat bread pizza but taste like a million bucks! Very unique taste  housemade pate, heritage pork rillete and ham amazing.  Onion Soup with all the fixings was very tasty! Nothing to write home about, but if you like onion soup for sure a good choice !   Cocktails..... Well don't mind if I do!  lost Generation is a flavor of the old amazing flavors of what a conga cocktail should be. Great balance !  Also the The Ritz was   Very tasty and  \"And God created  woman\" was a great choice .  This place is a must visit when at Aria !  Overall Chef Mina does an amazing job  and i lol forward to coming by again to visit and try some other dishes as well as some wines !",

There was not place on the table for the entree plates so I had to hold my hot plate while the food runner piled everything on the table on our half finished food. The waiter made us so uncomfortable about wanting to finish the starter that we just let him clear it.  My husband had a steak and fries, he enjoyed the steak, but the fries were not edible. We were able to squeeze grease out of them, and not just a drop. I had the pork, it came highly recommend from our server. It was overcooked, poorly butchered, and lacked flavor. The sauce was disappointing. The horseradish mashed potatoes tasted like raw garlic...which is strange. We only took one bite each, and decided they too would go uneaten.   The biggest problem came a few hours later, when we had to take turns in the restroom. A horrid end to our otherwise fantastic trip to Vegas.",

So this is what we chose and it lived up to our expectations.    Ambiance: modern take on traditional French architecture. Contrasted colors and brass everywhere. Very clean.    Drinks. I got a mescal drink with tobasco - it was not on the menu, but was fantastic.   Apps: I got bone marrow and escargot   Bone marrow : like always very good with chutney on the side.   Escargot: I didn't care for the fact that the snails were so hidden under so much stuff. But taste was good.   Food:  Lobster : amazing!  Definitely an a plus dish.   Sea bass : cooked perfectly.   Mac and cheese: neat take on the typical side dish. Seared on two sides. Also my looked like a pancake.    French onion soup: best I've ever had.",

    "text": "There are few times in my life that food has not been for a mere task of satisfying hunger, but actually been an experience and for satisfying all senses and desires! Obviously food can be sinful.   In this case Bardot was just that! A delectable, sinful experience that tantalizes all senses! We started off with a simple hors d'oeuvres such as the fruit plate which had the most amazing pistachio yogurt with it!not only where the tastes amazing but the display and pleading was exquisite. Nonetheless stopping at one appetizer would not do it. We also had a tasting plate of different pork pates` and presentation with crusty baguettes, thinly sliced cured ham, exquisite French mustard as well as butter that was to die for. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!   I had steak frites which seems safe, but it was nothing less than delectable! The fresh and cut fries were fried and salted to perfection. My mother had the salmon croissant eggs Benedict which was nothing less than a masterpiece for the eyes and a complete the affair to the stomach! Every creamy bite melted in your mouth! My cousin had French onion soup ( superb) and my son had beingnes ! Amazing!   Simply put the best French cuisine I have had In a while.   Some people  always rave about food but don't mention atmosphere in the review.. I'm not that gal!   Atmosphere was comfortable yet elegant. We had my two year old with us and the dinning room staff was so amazing to him and catered To us no differently than the business brunch group that arrived at the same time! Subtle lighting and clean modern French decor was romantic and fun.   I'd go back hands down!!",

Unfortunately, the service at the bar was terrible. There were two male bartenders, a female bar back, and the bar itself was not busy at all. The bar back was completely attentive and on top of it with water refills. She actually had to remind the bartender twice that I was waiting for my second cocktail, which never came. After 25 minutes of waiting, I demanded our check, which included the cocktail he never brought. I told him he never brought my drink and then he remembered, he left it sitting on the other end of the bar. He asked, \"Can I give you a to go cup so I don't have to take it off the bill?\" Needless to say, I was furious at this point. He mentioned his bosses interrupted him and he forgot about my drink. Remember, the bar back reminded him twice that I was waiting. I told him to remove the drink from the bill and it took him another 15-20 minutes to get it removed. Dreadful service.",

After a night out in Vegas there is nothing better than a beautiful brunch comprised of dishes ranging from out of this world fluffy french toast to savory steak and eggs. Lot's also not forget the most important party of brunch... The Bloody Mary. Staked with all the necessary accessories (a la olives, celery, pickle and lemon) this drink eliminated any pain caused the previous night and is possibly one of the best BM's ive had in Vegas, however be warned it is quite spicy but they are happy to make it to your tasting.   Bravo Bardot! Hope to see you again soon!  Thank you #YelpLADoesVegas!!!",

Awesome! Could've been for 4. Foie gras was a miss, there was a consistency problem. Great banquettes and tasty butter. Gnocchi was great! Macaroni was excellent! Chicken was delicious and juicy! Prepared perfectly!  So, they came through in the end.  I believe fixing the hostess issue quicker than 45 min. With an experienced or aware manager I would've given them a 5 star.  $200 bottle of wine great choice...and de cantered. But the sommelier was very late on locating the bottle and seemed stressed. There were a lot of stressed employees. Need to work it out",

    "text": "We came here for my honey's birthday brunch as he read great reviews about this restaurant.  When we were greeted by our server, I asked her if she could do something special for a birthday.  Her immediate response was not \"Thank you for coming to celebrate with us or Happy Birthday\" but instead it was a blunt - \"We do not give free dessert.\"  Ummm.... really?!  Did I ask for free?!  I gave her a disgusted look and said, could the kitchen put a candle or something on a creme brulee or cake?!  She didn't even apologized for her tactless comment and simply said, \"We can write Happy Birthday on the plate.\"  I replied and told her, \"Yes, will you please ask the chef to do that after our brunch?\" and she smiled (finally!) and said she'll be back to take our order.  After what seems like forever, she came back and took our order.  She recommended the Hunter's Waffle, which I ended up getting.  Sad to say, Michael Mina would have been disappointed at the dried, tasteless meat that was supposed to be \"duck confit\".  I never add salt to my meal, but I had no choice this time to give it some flavor!  I tried to catch our server's attention to let her know but she was no where to be found.  We tried to flag down other servers but all of them seem to have their eyes trained on looking down on the floor or tables -- and not on customers.  Granted -- it was a Saturday and they were busy but seriously, I was NOT impressed by the slow service -- or should I say the lack of service.  The only reason I gave this place a 2 star is because my honey's beef short ribs croissant benedicts was tasty.  Overall -- a truly disappointing dining experience...",

My boyfriend thought it was salty.  I had more of a 3 star experience - my filet mignon was not prepared as ordered and I sent it back.  I NEVER do that, but this steak was $54!!  I mean, come on!  It better be melt in your mouth orgasmic for that amount of money! And it truly was a very average filet, HOWEVER, after requesting it be redone, they did as I asked, fixed the problem and even took the item off the bill, so they more than compensated for the deficit.  I didn't mind paying for it but it just needed to be a $54 steak.  If you're gonna charge that, make it worth it.  But other than my solitary experience, like I said, the rest of my family seemed pleased, with their Salmon, Pork Chop, Chicken and less pricey steak.  Bread was yummy too.  Oh, and the ladies each got a long stem rose with dinner, for V Day.  Charming touch.  Nothing says romance like having dinner with your mother and two brothers.",

    "text": "I have NO business going to a French restaurant.  I request everything sans beurre, sans frommage, sans lait, since my curse developed in later-life is to be unable to tolerate dairy (thank goodness it struck after an indulgent honeymoon eating through France.)  However, my dear friend wanted to enjoy a French meal, so we wondered into Bardot Brasserie.  First, I must say that the service was SUPERB, and to me, service is a make or break aspect to a meal. The waiter and wine attendant were both fun, knowledgable, informative, and just lovely.  Although the chef had every right to be un petit perturbed with a no-butter diner, he and the waiter conferred to decide what could be best modified for me, after I preemptively declined the salad nicoise.  Chacuterie plate with bread--yum!  Blue crab buckwheat crepe sans butter--good, not great-- although I did sneak a pinch of sauce on top.  Beet salad with arugula so good-fresh and nutty arugula with hazelnuts to accent the nutty flavor, went perfectly with the goat cheese (I had to have a bite of the cheese).  My friend was practically cooing with pleasure from her escargot wrapped in pastry; she said it was smooth and buttery goodness.  The suggested wine was a pleasant surprise.  I'm not a white gal (well, white wine, that is), but completely enjoyed the nectar-y German Kabinett.  Finishing sorbets--orange and mango--so fresh and clean and more fruit-filled than just icy.  Great espresso.  Overall, a wonderful, indulgent lunch and I look forward to going back soon.  SO, if this dairy-free gal can enjoy it so much, I imagine how good it is for those who are unencumbered.  5 stars for my enjoyment at Bardot Brassiere. And, I never would have known it was the 3rd day open--kudos to Bardot Brasserie!",

Be ready to let go of some serious cash for a 3-4 course meal with wine; however, in my opinion it would be better to spend your hard-earned dollars on some exquisite pate de campagne than blowing it at the casino tables!

The meat was great. The skin, however, should have been crispier. For entrees, we ordered the Lobster Thermidor and Cote de Beouf. Though the lobster tasted very good, $46 pp for 6 chunks of meat is nutty. Our server seemed perplexed when we asked what the difference was between Cote de Beouf and Ribeye. For all of you anglophones, the first is French for the second one. Anyway, it was excellent. The three accompanying sauces were amazing. The French fries were pretty darn good too. Yelpers rave about the macaroni gratinee. It tasted fine though the reason we thought it was fine is because we both liked Kraft Dinner and this was a baked version of that very boxed dish. One would expect to pay a lot for the sides, but $15 for this is crazy. All in all we enjoyed our dinner, but would not pay anywhere close to the $300+ tab if it weren't comped.",

The waiter had suggested the thin potato fries they make for another dish, but he wasn't sure how it would taste.  We ordered it with the chips on the side.  It was actually really delicious with the chips.  The beet salad was extremely good, but the bone marrow was not as flavorful as it could have been.  It was the only disappointment in an otherwise exceptional dinner.  For entrees we had Loup de Mer (sea bass), the salmon and the Parisian Gnocchi.  All three preparations was absolutely wonderful.  We had to try the Giant Chocolate Macaron, and it was as wonderful as it looked.  The service was great, and no one was rushed to finish.

He brought a good deal of his personality to Bardot Brasserie, and I wanted to experience French cuisine at it's finest. A True french bistro is a tough find when in Las Vegas recently, I had the opportunity to escape from my obligations to have dinner at the restaurant. I asked to speak with Josh and a short time later he came over to my table and I invited him to sit with me. I mentioned that I had seen him on Munchies, and we spoke of my longing for traditional french fare. I decided to stick with appetizers this evening (a bunch of them!) because I could indulge my cravings for the more traditional french offerings, but as Josh would say, with a bit of a modern twist. Just what the doctor ordered. Even though I was just having appetizers, the order in which they came to the table was carefully considered. Not all together, but in a measured, comfortable way. The sommelier came over to the table and reviewed what I was having and suggested a glass that would satisfy throughout all the dishes. I believe it was the Patrick Piuze Val De Mer Cremant de Bourgogne Rose - a burgundy from France. Wow. She was spot on. Ok, every single dish that came to the table was inspired and delicious. I mean really good. Seriously. There was escargot with toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse butter in pastry shells followed by pate de campagne - a traditional housemade pate with heritage pork, veal and pistachios. Next came the bone marrow au piovre - a peppercorn and remy martin vsop crusted bone marrow, burgundy onion jam with cornichons and grilled country bread. Right about then, Chef Josh sent over, as a wonderful surprise, the duck a l'orange - wood-grilled wings, cointreau glaze with sauce maltaise. But I wasn't done yet. I couldn't resist the prime steak tartare. What's fabulous about the steak tartare is that it is ground to order, with sauce verge, egg yolk and gaunter potatoes. Simply delicious. I gotta tell you that it was one of the finest meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. Just appetizers. Go figure.",

    "text": "Great food, atmosphere, service and drinks. I'm not much of a 'yelper' but because of my experience here, and the fact that there is so much restaurant 'noise' in Las Vegas, I felt it was warranted. I've been to Vegas a ton of times, and have eaten in most of the high end places. I've eaten in many Michael Mina restaurants around the country as well. This time, I was here for a national sales meeting and had dinner at Bardot with my team of 12 from across the country. When I plan group dinners I prefer a prix fix as it's easier on everyone, and on my budget. Bardot had a great choice of menus in multiple price points that featured main courses that are high on the normal menu. Everything was great and everyone enjoyed their meals. What really set Bardot apart for me was in the service. Of course, we all enjoyed the food but for a 3 month old restaurant in Vegas, where there is so much transient help, I was impressed. I eat a vegan diet and also love to eat. In NY it's easy to eat where there are many inventive chefs and I'm not just getting a salad...in other places, it is hit or miss. At Bardot I got a great meal of multiple courses that followed the rest of the group. My dishes were plentiful in variety of ingredients and prepared quite well. Our entire service team, led by John Paul was great. He was attentive and responsive, timely and traditional in service. Explaining my vegan meal and the point of view of the chef de cuisine, which was greatly appreciated. Even after multiple rounds of champagne, wine and cocktails, managing a group of 12 women after all day meetings in Vegas, was easy for them all.  I will be back at the end of June and will visit again. We all enjoyed our experience (vegan and foie gras lovers alike) and would highly recommend Bardot.",

    "text": "Went to Bardot for breakfast yesterday on our last day in Vegas. We were looking forward to a relaxing great meal a little outside the casino craziness. Bardot could not have been MORE DISAPPOINTING. First typical Vegas lackluster service, which is almost expected but it only got worse.  Food took forever.  Quiche Lorriane is served almost cold The chef must never have read the recipe for \"classic quiche Lorraine\" because both had spinach and one didn't have any meat.  The only redemption was the manager took the quiche off the bill after we complained - but he never apologized nor did he even stop by to see how the replacement meal was... The replacement which was just the original meal reheated - took 20 minutes to reheat.   There is a reason this place is in the back corner of a mall. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO FIND IT. A DEFINITE SKIP IN LAS VEGAS.",

A few of the things we ordered included the foie gras parfait (delicious), charcuterie board and cheeses (had excellent selection on both boards). The pork chop was so tender.  My sister ordered the burger and loved it. Was very impressed by the meal as well as the beautiful decor.   I loved that our waitress really knew the menu and seemed excited about the dishes she recommended. The service was wonderful and we were very well taken care of. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "An amazing dining experience from start to finish! As soon as we stepped through the doors of Bardot we felt transported back to Paris... And not the historical aged Paris of today, but a fresh, clean and newly built Paris of the 1920s. The shiny brass of the beautiful bar, the marble floor and the dark wood with gold accents of the dining room is stunning!   We were celebrating our anniversary and we had a show to go to (our dinner reservation was 5pm and we had to leave for our show at 6:45pm) so timing was very important to us. Nelson and Angel were both very accommodating, making our evening extra special AND getting us to the show on time without feeling rushed.   And every bite of food was unbelievably delicious! We started with the tarte flambee, then the escargot Bardot, duck wings a l'orange and Parisian gnocchi with black trumpet mushrooms, goat cheese and garlic emulsion (we honestly didn't NEED to order so much food - there were simply too many great options to choose from and we didn't want to miss out on anything!). For entrees we enjoyed the pork chop with bacon lardons and whole grain mustard, as well as the steak burger. Both were great, but the pork chop was the star of the show! The sides of macaroni gratinee and French fries were pure decadence. We finished dinner with the chocolate macaron - chocolate on top of chocolate on top of chocolate. Pure bliss and culinary perfection! Thank you Bardot!",

The first meal I ordered 3 things. The chick pea fries which were good with lots of flavor, the tarte flambee was also very tasty but the best part of the meal was the foie gras parfait. This was maybe the best thing I have ever tasted. I spread it on my chick pea fries and my tarte . My second meal was the le steak burger. I am use to Michael Mina's burgers at Bourbon Steak in DC and this was nowhere close to those burgers. This one had good flavor but was crispy around the edges.",

It's a Michael Mina restaurant, which I didn't know who he was until I came here, but he made this restaurant be very classy. The decor is very inviting, sort of older, but still modern.  The hunters waffles and the French toast. Okay, so the hunters waffles were very much new to me. Now I've had the poached egg dish many times, but not like this. I haven't had duck with it. It really was different I think. The duck would've been better if it was shredded a bit more I think, but it was very good. The french toast was MASSIVE. A gigantic brick of french toast that had a nice, somewhat bitter flavor, that leaves you so stuffed, you'll regret attempting to finish it in one sitting. One thing I would've liked was instead of the almond syrup, if we had been given regular syrup. The almond syrup sounds more appealing, but I think it made it a bit too bitter.  Bardot was a fantastic experience that I plan on revisiting the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The escargot was in a puff pastry--so yummy.  Oysters were fresh and delicious.  The french onion soup---I have come to find that not everyone can get it right.  This place however, did it very well.  Furthermore, their sommelier came to our table and talked with us for a while and then even gave suggestions and tastings of wine with some of our items!!!! It was sooo neat, and he clearly knew what he was doing, because each wine with the food enhanced everything.  Service was impeccable.  We were stuffed by the end, but not like sick stuffed, just the right amount.  I will be back for sure.",

Most foot traffic wouldn't even know it was there unless they were looking for it.  Food: Our cocktails were delicious.  The bread they serviced was not sliced. I know its a small gripe but it can make a world of difference in an upscale restaurant. It also didn't help that the bread was baked to the point where cutting / breaking it at a table just made a big mess.  We had the gnocchi and filet mignon.  The gnocchi was good but not great. I was expecting more based on reviews.  The filet mignon I ordered medium and came out well. We were short on time so I didn't bother having it corrected. The meat overall was still good for it not being cooked to my liking.  Service: Service was outstanding. We had a reservation so we were seated quickly. Our waiter was very informative about the menu. I'm not sure if this was apart of the experience but our photos were taken by a worker. She had said she would get us a copy before we were done with dinner but we were gone before she came back.  Overall: I definitely will give Bardot another chance when I'm in town. I would definitely recommend it. I would also recommend not rushing through dinner here as well.",

Dino, Tim and Erick are pros and will take good care of you and they serve full menu at the bar.  They have an everlasting Rose option for $30 which is exactly what it says you drink as much as you like.  Rose is not my first choice in wine, but it was summer time and I figured Id give it a try.  It was excellent.  And then there is the food.  All I have to say is bravo to the chefs that are clearly taking their jobs very seriously.  This review is actually referring to 2 different times I went there within 2 weeks.  Night 1 Drink:  Aperol White Wine Spritzer (if you have been to Italy you know what this is and Dino made it perfectly), Also had a glass of burgandy and a pinot. pretty solid. Food: Foie Gras Parfait- this was some of the best prepared Foie gras Ive ever had and Ive traveled in multiple parts of France.   Onion soup with egg and truffle-so good, Im kind of a purest so I wouldn't order it this way every time, but wow the flavors, and broth were outstanding.   Bread:  They have complimentary baguette and the butter tastes house made, very good.    Night 2: I decided to order the 4 course summer menu: TUNA NICOISE TARTINE-very solid and the quail egg was a nice touch DUCK WINGS A L'ORANGE-I love duck and these wings were cooked to perfection and the maltaise sauce served in a tangerine skin was such a nice touch LAMB RACK \"FRITES\": Cooked perfectly and the chick pea frites were exquisite, your brain is of course expecting a french fry, which makes for quite a surprise, but in a refined way that is in every way positive.   CHERRY CLAFOUTI- The cherrys in this are so flavorful and the pistachio cherry flavor combo is slightly reminiscent of home made spumoni ice cream.    The only constructive criticism I can muster on this place is that one or two lower cost (maybe $10) house red wines would be nice as the red wine starts at $16 per glass, but hey it is Vegas after all.  Otherwise price points are pretty solid.   Michael Mina delivers with this wonderful place, with stellar food that rivals many places Ive been in Paris, and spectacular service.  I could definitely become a regular at Bardot if I lived in Las Vegas.",

We made reservations and indicated to birthdays that we are celebrating. My general manager, myself ( AGM) my production manager and some teammates Who work at a property next-door came in for brunch. We arrived on time and were greeted at the host stand. Only a five minute wait as we had a reservation we were walking to the backside of the dining room to be greeted by an empty dirty table. The hostess seem flustered and apologized saying that she thought the table was ready and it is not so we'd have to go back up front and wait. We waited for an additional 15 minutes upfront and we're finally sat at our table. Unfortunately the service kept going downhill because Server was late on the greet and we waited about 5 to 7 minutes and still took 10 to 15 minutes to even get water on the table. There was a couple items that we ordered but never made to the table as well. The food was good as we expected. My steak was cooked perfectly French toast was awesome.They never  acknowledged birthdays that we were celebrating as well. Completely disappointed in the service that someone has worked in the area at a restaurant next-door I couldn't believe it.",

It came with buttered brioche bread which was a perfect balance of crunchy yet soft. Then I got the famous French onion dip with the accompaniments. I don't even like that soup but this was incredible. Because it was two heavy dishes I opted to not finish them but they were delicious! They both are very rich so I'd rather sample and enjoy than overload. Service was lovely and they give u crunchy French bread with salted butter. So yummy! Great decor. Highly recommend.",

It was a loaf of brioche bread with candied almonds and almond syrup on the side. The crust was crunchy and caramelized. The inside was warm and so soft.  The almond syrup was a perfect complement to the french toast.  My wife had the Hunter's Waffle, although it seemed more like Eggs Benedict.  It had duck confit, poached eggs, and veggie hash.  It was amazing.  It was flavorful, and the eggs were poached perfectly.  The duck confit was yummy, and not greasy.  The food deserves 5-stars!  But I had to deduct a star because the service.  The people were nice, but we were left on our own a lot.  I had ordered coffee, and no one ever checked to see if I needed a refill.  We also emptied our water, and actually flagged down what appeared to be a manager checking up on the room.  So if we needed anything, or a refill, we needed to flag someone down.  It's a new place, so I'm sure the service will get better.  I'll be back for the food.",

    "text": "Oh wow. During my most recent three day stop in Vegas that included some of the city's finest - brunch at Bardot was hands down the highlight thanks to some of the best and most unique french toast I've ever had.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  In a city of hour plus waits for brunch and all sorts of other ridiculousness, Bardot has kept the classic model intact, and I was easily able to secure a 10:15 brunch reservation for four the Saturday morning of a music festival weekend. Our party was seated immediately and the service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Bardot isn't cheap, but honestly it was entirely more reasonable than what I was expecting. I ordered the absolutely massive sticky bun for the table as a starter, and while yes $16.00 is absurd when you're of the mindset that you can get something somewhat similar at Cinnabon for 30% of that, the quality here was noteworthy.   For a better comparison, the Steakburger at Bardot is $19.00. That's above my $15.00 burger threshold but not by much.  My french toast, which could have comfortably fed two, came in at $19.00, which was entirely reasonable given the quality. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  My oh my. I've had some truly out of this world french toast in my day to include what came out of my own household as a child, but I'd never had anything that resembled the French Toast at Bardot.  While the massive block of bread was intimidating at first, I quickly realized that I could cut into it's buttery smooth texture with a quick swipe of the fork, and the airy texture was flawlessly combo'd with a butter-like whipping cream that I could have eaten all by itself and been perfectly happy. I'm not an almond guy, but the almond brittle and orgeat syrup went over well at the table, and all in all this was a truly stellar dish. Dual Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I'll take Bardot over a Vegas buffet, or any other alternative, any day of the week. Star Granted.",

    "text": "Very nice expensive French restaurant at the Aria.  Even the cheapest steak ($49 flat iron) is exquisite -- they clearly make use of sous vide to get a butter texture out of the meat.  I liked the brandy-peppercorn sauce, though it wasn't the best one I've had.  I almost wish I hadn't let the waiter convince me to get that instead of the blue cheese fondue.   The frites that accompany the steak were good, but a little salty and a little oily.  I did like the crispness and lack of starchiness.  The lobster bisque was very good as was the bread & butter on the table.  The bread is a french sourdough and the butter is smooth, spreadable, and the right temperature.  Service was good, but not fast even after we told them some members of our party were going to a show.    All in all a good and expensive meal.",

    "text": "My gf's and I were staying at Aria and this restaurant was luckily downstairs. It's hard to find good French food/restaurant in LA so I was pretty excited to check out Bardot. The inside is very nice, romantic and dim. It looked very Parisian. As you are seated they give you complimentary baguette, which is amazing! You know it's a darn good bread if when you break it you can hear the crackle, but still be soft in the inside. Very fresh and just what a baguette should be. The butter was standard but even better when you added a pinch of sea salt. We all were in the mood for a bunch of appetizers, rather than big meals per se.   _Bardot Salad ($14) Gem lettuce, Dijon vinaigrette. Simple, yet very tasteful. The lettuce were huge, fresh and crisp. The vinaigrette was a tad sweet, acidic and tart. I love the lingering taste of the Dijon. A bit pricey for a very simple salad with just some greens, but also very good if you want something to start with. _Foie Gras Parfait ($18) Chilled mousse of la belle foie gras, ruby port gelee grilled country bread. This was an automatic for all of us. I mean can I get a amen or an amen! The 4 thick slices of baguette were crisp, yet soft in the outside. The parfait was silky, and not gamey. The ruby port on top helped to cut out any gamey flavor that may linger and give it a sweetness and tartness flavor that is always the best when eating a parfait. One of my favorite dishes of the night! A bit rich but worth unbuttoning your pants for :) _Escargots Bardot ($19) Wild burgundy snails wrapped individually in puff pastry, toasted hazelnuts chartreuse-garlic butter. This was pretty tiny and came in 6 servings. I got to eat one, although I wish I could have had more not only because It tasted so good but I felt one wasn't enough to really capture the flavor as they are so tiny. The puff pastry was nicely fried and a very thin layer at that, a little buttery and flaky. The snail flavor was a tad chewy, but overall cooked perfectly. The texture almost seemed more like mushrooms, if you did not know, you would not guess you were eating snails. _Black Truffle French Fries ($14) When we first got this our waitress made a mistake and brought us regular fries. My friend and I kept thinking and saying not only do I not taste truffle at all, I don't even smell it. Glad to know we switched it off for actual truffle fries. When it came you can already tell by the color and aroma it was truffle. The aioli was great and paired perfect with the fries, it actually brought out the truffle flavor more. I will say, our tables all agreed the fries were so darn oily! As I ate just one fry I can already see all the oil on my fingertips.  _Burrata Salad. This was a bit bland. The salad was more of about 4 small lettuces, a few snap peas, a few asparagus and 4 tiny slices of peaches. I will say the peaches were the highlight of the dish. Not even the burrata, but the peaches. They were so fresh and sweet. The burrata itself was a bit small and the texture was a bit disappointing. It did not have that silky and elasticity to it. I felt some balsamic or some type dressing would have made this a bit better.  _Heritage Chicken Roti ($34)  1/2 free-range chicken, mushroom bread pudding, green beans, sauce vin jaune. Good sized half chicken. The chicken was very moist and well cooked. Not dry whatsoever and the seasoning was pretty spot on. The skin was perfectly crisp, although I found it pretty salty. I can see why the chicken was a bit lighter on seasoning, since the skin itself was more on the salty side, it was a good balance. The mushroom bread pudding did not really do it for me. It was heavy, oily and buttery and did not compliment the chicken whatsoever, it was just random and unnecessary. The green beans were good.  _Chocolate Macaron ($13) French chocolate cookie, valrhona chocolate mousse. Being a bit chocolate fan, when I saw this on yelp, I had to get it. The dessert was the main reason I wanted to try this restaurant. This was a very huge portion, think of those small ones by Lette, but on steroids. As it came out, our waitress drizzled chocolate sauce all over the plate and macaron. At first bite it was divine, as well as the other few, but then it started to get real rich and heavy. I did like the texture of the macaron, it had a nice bite and the ganache was silky, but I would need to eat small bites of this and with some rest in between. I felt maybe the chocolate sauce was not necessary since it was already so rich, but regardless glad I got to try this.  _Mille Feuille ($13) Caramelized puff pastry, vanilla creme patisserie. I must say this was pretty good but I expected more. The puff pastry was perfectly thin and crisp, which I think is the most important part of mille feuille. The cream was light and not too rich. It was good to have this with the chocolate macaron since one was way sweeter and richer than the other.  Great experience, I would recommend checking Bardot out.",

Being an east-coaster myself, it was great to converse with the bartender who was from Ohio. She knew my hometown in PA; we also talked about celebrity sightings and such. Had a few laughs with her and enjoyed our time at Bardot! Will return...",

    "text": "The food is GREAT! The environment is on point. And they are gluten friendly! I have celiac disease and dining out always gives me some level of anxiety bc there is nothing worse than when you go to a restaurant and the waiter doesn't even know what gluten is (horrifying!) but our waiter communicated with the chef regarding my dietary restrictions and made me feel confident that anything I ordered could (for the majority of the menu) be made gluten free and THAT always is music to my ears! The reason why I'm reviewing 3 Stars our of 5 is because it is VERY loud in the restaurant, almost unsettling. Also, the service was slow. And I don't think it was related to my dietary restrictions or the fact that it was a Saturday night because even when the restaurant died down it was slow. I would definitely eat there again but next time probably at the bar where I think service may be a little quicker and out of the main room where all the noise is. Hope this helps!  Ps always get duck at French restaurants. WOW! And the bone marrow?! To die for.",

    "text": "After a couple of meals at Bardot Brasserie, it's fair to say the hors d'oeuvres are more interesting than the entrees.  The initial visit had my wife and me tapping out after indulging in 5 appetizers and for the most recent visit, we went with six appetizers and two entrees for a party of 3.  PEI mussels, dayboat scallops and king salmon aren't normally things I turn my nose up to, but French food occasionally tickles my snobby bone, so I said \"Reste loin de moi!\" to all that.    The wood grilled duck wings a l'orange belong at a tailgate party for millionaires.  That distinct flavor that only duck has went splendidly with the blood orange glaze and the maltaise could challenge many a wing sauce to a duel and win.  This is an excellent starter to share or hog all to yourself.     Whether it's grilled, torchon, parfait, or rolled up into balls and thrown into my mouth by a circus clown, foie gras is fucking awesome.  Their seared version with beluga lentils, caramelized shallots and prune confiture was everything I was hoped for, everything I need.  Lightly smushing and spreading the prune on top with the back of a spoon ensured a nice tart fruit flavor in each bite.    Not my choice to order, but I found the filet mignon to be a total snoozefest.  Although I could NOT get enough of the \"beef fat fries\" that it came with.  Can I preorder \"beef fat cake\" for my birthday??  Crunchy, salty, and borderline immoral, I wished more places offered this.  Get the stellar \"Lamb Rack Frites\" for an entree over steak and ask for a side of fries.    - Ask for bread with the prime steak tartare.  It's much better than the potato chips. - The \"onion soup gratinee\" was too sweet for me.    So tapas it up and share it all!  Everlasting Rose for $30 makes life even more grand!",

I highly recommend that you get the basket of Pastries for Brunch.  They look a little pricey, that is until you taste them.  I lived in Germany for a couple years and have been to Paris.  These were hands down the best I have ever had.  I am including a picture this time.  Even the Butter is great and they claim it is the best in the world!  I'm not going to argue with them.  I also really enjoyed the Duck Waffles again and the Hash Browns were also great.  The best thing we tried this time though was the giant Chocolate Macaron!!!  I love Bardot and I will be back any time I get the chance and it has really made me want to check out all of Michael Mina's restaurants!",

I would suggest dinner as a date spot but during the day (when I went) it was a lot of groups. Their brunch deal is pretty good for Vegas, and is  $25 for bottomless rose and then you pay for whatever entree you want.   They will try to sell you on the \"worlds best butter\", but honestly it was nothing great and tasted like the regular butter.   I decided to get the Hunter's Waffle, which is a Benedict on a waffle, had the typical poached egg and came with delicious duck confit. Overall a great take on a Benedict. I also added a side of the hash browns that were thick, crispy, and flavorful. My friend tried the French Toast, which was huge with the brioche bread. It was very good but a little too sweet for me.   Overall, the service was great and the ambiance was fun. Good brunch in Vegas!",

Daily from 5pm-7pm in the bar & lounge, BARDOT Brasserie offers an incredible happy hour that includes cocktails, oysters & plates.  I started my evening with the French 75. Made with Calvados, Gin & Cognac, it was one of the best I've ever had and proceeded to have 2 more throughout the evening. Next up was their daily selection of oysters, which included both east and west coast. Served on a bed of ice, these were incredibly fresh and came with hot sauce, lemon, cocktail sauce and their amazing homemade mignonette sauce.   I also ordered their MUSSELS MARINARES- salt spring island mussels, garlic butter, white wine, tarragon, grilled country bread. These were absolutely PERFECTION. The best mussels I've ever had. The broth was so incredible I could have drank it. Thankfully, they give you plenty of buttery grilled country bread so no need to slurp.   On top of excellent food and attentive service, the atmosphere is divine. You really do feel like you're in an upscale brasserie in Paris. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Quick summary: Bardot is a fine dining French restaurant in a major Las Vegas resort (the Aria), and as such is expensive, although not by Las Vegas standards.  Unlike most other similar Vegas restaurants, Bardot is worth the outlay.  The ambiance is very much old-school, with dark woods in an uncrowded setting and an unexpected view of the glass-enclosed kitchen.  Here, six or seven chefs were preparing your meal -- not just throwing it together but carefully crafting your plate with attention and care to detail.  The food is good because of their efforts and because the recipes (old style French) and the ingredients are excellent.  I won't recommend individual items because I think whatever strikes your fancy with also please your palette.  Service is, of course, perfect.  So was dessert.  Go ahead, spend the money; it's better than giving it to some blackjack dealer.",

We kept coming across these appetizing pictures of its brunch offerings in Vegas hospitality magazines and finally decided to give it a try in July 2019. We had made reservations for brunch, and while it seemed fully booked, we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival. The place is classy and well-appointed. The decor is very appropriate and suited for an authentic French bistro. They start you off with these cute personal baguettes in paper bags, and wonderful creamy European butter. It has been said that a measure of how good a dining establishment is, is their butter. On this front, BARDOT did not disappoint! Our server Rositsa was very pleasant, polite, and attentive, and helped us by making quite a few good suggestions regarding our food and drink choices. We ordered the Hunters Waffle, the Steak and Eggs, the Prime Rib Dip, and the Prosciutto Benedict. All were well presented and delicious and hit the spot! I must say that the Brioche French Toast looked extremely tempting but I was looking for something more savory at the time. I will definitely try it the next time. All and all, BARDOT Brasserie provides great ambiance and excellent food. We plan to be back the next time we visit Vegas. Perhaps for lunch or dinner, or maybe for brunch again!",

You know exactly what I mean, it lingered on the palate to say the least, and there was barely any seafood on it. They think it's a good idea to cover their steaks in liquid smoke, and they're not fooling anyone; the result is a terrible chemical tasting hunk of meat. The mac and cheese and the butter was excellent, but sad that that's the only positive part of this place.

They were both great options but if you have to pick you must get the foie gras! This dish was just amazing!  For our main curse we got the oak smoked duroc pork chop and the prime steak filet mignon. The smoked pork chop had a great smoky taste, perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  The filet mignon was also delicious. They truly know how to cook their meats. For a side dish we got the mac and cheese! Which was phenomenal! And let's not forget about dessert. The macaron dessert and coffee creme brulee were equality fantastic. I couldn't decide which one I liked the most! . If you are here for brunch take advantage of the unlimited rose and you must try the french toast!",

Big bar in the center of restaurant looks really impressing. Decor is French style, beautiful flowers and bottles of champaign Moet.   Restaurant is big enough, even tho is crowded there is place for anyone.  We had little but cozy table at the bar which I was fine with because we didnt want to spend to much time there.  Service was really fast and we got our food after 15 minutes since we ordered. Food was excellent but I wish they had at least some cherry tomatoes as a side dish. Croissant tasted good, was really fresh. Coffee is another plus, much better that coffee shops.   We were really satisfied and we will come back for dinner. Pity this restaurants works only until 11 PM even on Friday night. Otherwise we would already tried dinner there.  5/5",

I expect value and service.  Period.",

BARDOT definitely looks and feels like a french restaurant.  I haven't gone to many but this place is definitely one of my favorites.  We started off with some drinks and hors d'oeuvres.  The steak tartare was the best I've ever had!  I would definitely recommend getting this.  We also got the escargots bardot which was definitely different than how I normally eat escargot.  The snails were wrapped individually in puff pastry and with toasted hazelnuts chartreuse-garlic butter.  I got the loup de mer au fenouil as my entree which was a roasted mediterranean sea bass with a caramelized lemon, fennel, and fingerling potatoes.  The fish was cooked perfectly but I was so full from the appetizers that I only ate about half of it.    Service was exceptional.  Our waiter explained everything very well and made good suggestions on items to get.  I would definitely go back if I get a chance!",

The bottomless rose is the best deal for a cocktail which was currently $28. Our sever, Oscar, was excellent. Never left with an empty glass....right on top of everything, including informing us of extra charges on certain items which is vary rare.   As for the food. Wow! I had the breakfast sandwich. It was a huge homemade English muffin with sage breakfast sausage, omelet, & mimolette fondue. It came with hash browns that were not your standard diner style. They were in block form making the whole outside crispy and the inside tender. My husband had the prime rib French dip. It was so tender it melted in your mouth. He upgraded to truffle fries that were definitely worth the up charge!  We also got a side of double cut bacon. Smokey bacon heaven! Can't wait to return",

    "text": "When you want to try something different and being French food, you gotta make a pit stop here at least once whether you are a local or just visiting.  The fiance and I decided to make a trip down here during Valentines weekend. Just like everybody says, do make reservations at this place a lot of people go here to celebrate every occasion.   Located inside the beautiful Aria hotel on the second floor. The dark wood and the decor itself make it feel welcoming and warm. Since our reservation was around 11am we got seated right away. We  already looked over the menu and saw a few items that were calling our names. They do have starters, main course, raw bar, soups/salads, side and croissant Benedict's. So after looking over the menu one last time, we decided to go a little lighter since we did not know if the portions were big or not. Looking at the pics prior they looked regular sized. I decided to get the French toast (brioche bread accompanied by vanilla mascarpone and almond brittle, with orgeat syrup on the side). I also decided to get the seasonal fruit since they had the beignets. Who can turn these down? I love them! My fiance decided to go with the Le Prime Steakburger (prime rib steak patty, Comte cheese, garlic aioli, onions and hand cut fries).   Wait did take some time to prepare, so hopefully you can come by when you are enjoying a non-working day. Luckily, we did not feel rushed, but pressed for time since had work. So the food came, and I can say the French toast was big enough for two. The seasonal fruit was pretty and decorated, you kindda do not want to eat it. The beignets were also fresh! The steakburger looked appetizing, but you never can go wrong with prime rib patties. The first bite of the French toast with the orgeat syrup, crunchy on top and fluffy like clouds mixed with the light syrup! The almond brittle also added a sweet and salty taste, which added to the entire experience. The fruit, I finally decided to take a bite, and everything was perfectly sweet! You know at other places it would be too sour or bland. The best part was biting into the sugary beignets, as they were just like biting into cotton candy but with more fluff to it. As for my fiance, the bread was just as soft, the prime patty, was so tender he wished he had more. He also wanted more to the garlic aioli to give it that, I can give a run for your money kick. The fries were the best part for him.   Overall a good place to get some French food and to go to when you want something different. Price wise, expect to be spending $70 or higher with tip. Definitely will come back to try the other items on the menu.",

The escargot wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was still good. We had a king crab Caesar salad and it was the best Caesar I've ever had, maybe it was the presentation of being served on individual lettuce stalks, but I could eat that every day! My husband had the onion soup and said it was the most \"legit\" onion soup he's ever had. FULL of onions, unlike many French onion soups he has had. My meal was the sea bass and it was most tender and juicy sea bass I've ever had. It was a full fish, without the head. The meal was pricey, of course, but it was all so good!",

Immediately I was blown away by the look of the place.  It is simple yet very complex.  It is brash yet very refined.  It is fancy yet rustic.  I loved the feel of this restaurant.     We got a selection of foods to try: Bread and butter:  Really good and the salted butter was amazing. Escargot bardot:  Tiny little escargot, breaded, with garlic butter all over them.  Could easily eat these like popcorn, by the handfuls. Chicken french dip:  Buttery, soft and very flavorful, especially with the dipping sauce.  I have never had chicken as tender as this.  It almost melted in my mouth. Duck wings a l'orange:  Sticky, citrusy, flavorful, and everything you look for in wings.  I liked them better without the sauce though.  I only got to try a little of each dish and did not get to pick these as they were part of our package but I loved everything and want to go back and have an actual meal here stat!  I feel like this kind of restaurant is what I am about.  Exquisite food that is approachable and recognizable.",

    "text": "Definitely one of my new Vegas restaurants! The experience was great the second we walked in. We had reservations for 8PM and we arrived at 730pm and we were seated right away! We sat in a little room and it was nice and quiet which was very nice. The host and the wait staff were fantastic. They were attentive to our needs and they were very talkative and pleasant people.   We ordered the Escargot Bardot and World's Best Butter for starters. We did not know that the table came with bread so we ordered the butter but we ended up getting the standard butter and the World's Best Butter. The World's Best Butter was actually very creamy. The waitress told us that it is organic and hand churned in France. The actual table Butter was really tasty as well. It was definitely hard to decide which butter was better. The Escargot was amazing! It was wrapped in a puff pastry with garlic butter. It was nice and warm when it came out and they were decently sized. The crazy part was that the chef made a mistake and thought our food was delayed and gave us complimentary Foie Gras Parfait. I'm so glad he did because it was so tasty. The Foie Gras with the jelly and the cherries had a nice flavor. I would highly recommend it.   For our entrees we ordered the Scallops Meuniere and the bone in rib eye. Both choices were fantastic. The scallops were cooked to perfection and it was a nice flavorful. The steak was very tender and the sauces that came with it were perfect. I got it medium and I thought it was just right. The meat was very tender and it was a great portion. I opted for the truffle fries and they were nice and crispy which was nice. I like how they had it in a container so they wouldn't get soggy from the juices. We were stuffed and didn't do dessert. As for drinks, do yourself a favor and get the Smokey old fashioned and the midnight in Paris. Both drinks were good. The Smokey old fashioned was very Smokey tasting but it was enjoyable and light. The Midnight in Paris was very fruity and tasty and easy to drink.",

We had several appetizers: the king crab crepe (which was my favorite and very tasty), the Foie Gras Parfait(which was also great), and the French onion soup. Wow, were they great teasers! For the main course my husband had the sea bass (which he loved and ate every last bite) while I had the lamb chops which was just delicious. Dessert: rum cake with a smooth cream topping (can't remember the name).  Overall this place was just great! Our server, Nelson, was even better. Very knowledgable about the menu, provided excellent recommendations and was very attentive! Definitely recommend this restaurant for all French food lovers!!!",

The roast marrow bones could have used a tad more under the broiler, and they should not have had ketchup or bbq sauce or whatever that was slathered on them. It provided a nice tang, but in the end prevented any sort of caramelization of the marrow. The onion soup was so so -- too thick a crust of cheese that set up way too quickly. The lamb rack was delicious, if a little stringy in places. The tarte tatin was difficult to eat, due to the pastry being impervious to every provided utensil.  Good service, OK food, nice (but very heavily marked up) wine list.",

A little over toasted but the sauce was good. The escargot crusted with a flakey bread was delicious. The clams was fresh. Overall a pretty decent place but dont plan to come back soon.

Every dish was heavily salted to the point where 3 of us couldn't finish our dishes. We brought it up after the meal because it was late and we really just wanted to leave because it was so busy and took about 45 min to get our check. When we did bring it up all that was said was sorry we will let chef know.  The manager on duty came by and offered to give us desert. Not really something we even wanted after with nothing but sodium on the palate .   After. $350 meal I expected more.",

For brunch I highly recommend les moules e frites (mussels), and the Maine lobster scramble. The French toast is also good but MASSIVE so I suggest you share it with at least one other person. My boyfriend loves the fruit plate, hunters waffle, and prime rib sandwich. The quiches here are also to die for, especially the mushroom and goat cheese!  For dinner, we come here less often, but we enjoy the escargot appetizer, and the steaks are decent. They have lots of special tasting/meal menus that change on the regular!   The reason this restaurant has 4 instead of 5 stars is the service. It is hit or miss. There are times where the service has been average, and bearable, but there have been two times where the service has been absolutely AWFUL (I won't bore you with the details). I've never had service here that I thought was outstanding. It's always either average or poor.  Overall, I'll be back because it's the best French food in Vegas!

    "text": "Another meal, another Michael Mina restaurant. Never a disappointment.  We started with a few items to share like their escargot which is a little different from the traditional plates/skillets with circular dents to hold the snails. These were not drenched in butter/sauce and were still delicious. I should also mention that their complimentary baguettes were delicious with butter.  I decided to order the Chicken French Dip. I'm usually not a fan of french dip sandwiches, but this one stood out to me because it had mushroom bread pudding in it. One bite was like a mouthful of Thanksgiving except the turkey part. When you think about it, it makes sense: the luscious bread pudding texture with mushrooms, and the haricot verts (much like a green bean casserole) and with pieces of chicken that were moist (unlike dry turkey). I was really happy with my choice.  I also had a bite of their Hunter's waffle which is another popular choice with duck confit in it. Think of an eggs benedict but with a waffle and duck confit.  Service was fantastic. Our waitress kept stopping by to warm up my coffee and they were absolutely attentive with picking up plates and even providing us recommendations. It's kind of a hard choice between whether or not I like Bardot more than Bouchon, but if you really want more pastries, go for Bouchon. I think Bardot has a more extensive menu of rich and savory plates.",

The bar and lounge opens early evening so it was very convenient for us to grab some drinks and bar food.   During our bar times, we tried a few cocktails, they all tasted so good and strong. They use classic martini glasses, which is very upscale and elegant. Hubby tried French onion soup, it was very delicious and comforting.   Our dinner was AMAZING, very slow cause it's a French restaurant, but everything came out perfectly, we really enjoyed our Christmas Day dinner!   Starters: French bread with butter: fresh and yummy.  Escargots pastry puff: very tender and flavorful escargots, but I never liked pastry puff too much, I always get very nervous if I have to eat carbs. Hubby loved it.   Entrees: Filet rare plus with French fries: a beautiful cut of filet cooked to perfection, just the way hubby liked it, housemade sauce was so good, I loved the French fries, the very best I have ever tasted!   Branzino head and bones off, with onions and fingerling potatoes: FANTASTIC fish, so fresh and tender, flavors were very well balanced, loved it!   Side of mushrooms: rich flavors, very delicious!  Dessert creme brulee: it was chilled in stead of warm, very soft and sweet, so yummy.   Bottle of reserved Perrier was so good, espresso martini was strong and tasty, hubby liked his espresso shots too.    It was a great dinner, they had a photographer taking photos of dining people, loved the photos she took, very cute! Definitely one of the best dining experiences we have ever had!   Just love this restaurant and bar, think we will eat and drink here every time we stay at Aria!",

We had been viewing they're menu for some time now and finally decided to pull the trigger!  Haha   We showed up and fell in love with the bar they have at the entrance.   Our server was a French girl I believe sorry if I'm wrong but she was amazing!!   We ordered the foie gras parfait with toast the port jelly on there was nice tart and sweet for the richness of the foie..  The lobster scramble with caviar was frikkin awesome! Perfect amount of caviar it will not be over whelming I will definitely order this again.   Of course being a Sunday we both ordered bottomless Rose that they offer and our server made sure to keep it flowing!!!   Thank you Bardot!",

The place was packed and our server was really slow (took her 15 min just to bring water...) but that was the only negative comment I can make on this restaurant. We mainly went there to try the foie gras which was perfect! It comes with fresh toasts and had so much flavor! It was definitely the highlight of our dinner.  For entrees I got the mussels and my girlfriend got the salmon. Regarding the mussels, the dish was okay, not the best I ever had but it was decent, comes with Baguette to dip in the sauce. The salmon was delicious, melting in your mouth and the sauce was great.   Overall good atmosphere, just wish our service was a little better otherwise I would have given 5 stars.",

Lots of rose centerpieces, soft lighting and gorgeous bar with gold shelves holding their liquor including an impressive selection of chartreuse. We showed up for our 1:30p reservation 10 minutes late as we had a difficult time finding it and the hostess let us know the kitchen would close in 5 minutes so we had to order quickly. We were seated and right away I knew I wanted a Benedict. I tried the short rib Benedict served on croissants and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was wonderful, also came with a hefty $6 price tag. In the Benedict I loved the texture and flavor of the short rib, and would've liked a bit more hollandaise sauce and fresher croissants as they tasted a bit stale. The butter that accomplished the complimentary bread was to die for, the bread was nothing special. I'm glad I ate here though not a place I would return to with so many options in Vegas.",

I wish I could go with 3.5 stars, because the atmosphere was lovely and the food was good, but I've definitely had better French cuisine elsewhere.  Food:  - \"World's Best Butter\": really average; didn't taste like anything; the free butter tasted better  - Escargots Bardot: each escargot was wrapped in puff pastry - it made the snails have more of a savory taste, vs. a seafood taste; the garlic butter wasn't as noticeable as when snails are prepped more traditionally; a very novel take on a traditional dish  - Halibut: the fish pulled apart really easily and the sauce was awesome, but because halibut is a firmer fish, it felt a little under seasoned  Drinks: Awesome bar with an accommodating bartender.",

The noise level is not very loud, and great for conversation without having to yell.  Ordered the special for that night - Bluefin and tuna belly.  The fish was absolutely delicious!  The bluefin was cooked to perfection and the tuna belly was so tender it melted in my mouth.  My gf got the flank steak, which was also tasty.  A somme also came by and paired our wine with our dinner to perfection.  They even gave us a comped mousse macaroon for dessert.  Overall, great dining experience at Bardot!",

I had the beet and goat cheese salad to start which was very good but nothing I haven't had before. The sea bass as my main course. I was pretty disappointed it was oily and bland. I wanted to order the cod but they were out. And for dessert I had the espresso Creme brulee which was excellent.  My husband had the lobster bisque which was good and then a steak which was not special in anyway and also shared the dessert with me.   The drinks were probably my favorite part i got the \"and God made woman\" but since i went for the food and was not wowed i give it a solid 3 Star. Probably won't be back.",

    "text": "My husband and I were very impressed by the food and service at Michael Mina's BARDOT Brasserie!   We made dinner reservations for our first night in Vegas and we felt like we were taken to Paris with fine ingredients, French decor, and our spectacular and charming server!   Even though the menu isn't too extensive, we were unsure of what to order at first. Everything sounded so good. We finally decided to share the grilled duck wings a l'orange and bone marrow appetizers, beets salad, and Parisian gnocchi with a side of fois gras.   We had to add the fois gras after reading several good reviews and my goodness, it was just fatty delicacy! My hubby loved it. The Parisian gnocchi was fluffy and pillowy soft. I thought the gnocchi and fois gras combination made that particular dish a bit on the heavy side, especially with the addition of cream. But it was a small portion size so it wasn't hard to finish. The shaved black truffles was also a nice touch to the dish.   I loved how the beets salad had huge chunks of red and orange beets. The vinaigrette and baked Brie and goat cheeses were a nice touch. We really liked that dish.   The bone marrow was also fatty goodness as I try to scoop up every ounce of it with the thick toast. I thought there was little bone marrow for the price and wished for more of it than bread.   I've never had duck wings before but it was meaty (doesn't look like it in the pictures) and had a nice sweet glaze that combines well with the cream that had a hint of orange flavor.   We thoroughly enjoyed the food and definitely ordered more than we can finish. The service was excellent and the restaurant is just beautiful that we would love to return when we're back in Vegas.",

She had the New York strip which was obviously a bit leaner but exactly what she wanted. The Charing on the steak was delicious and I went with the blue cheese fondue for a sauce on the steak. For the sides the hand cut fries and the mushroom dish that came on a croissant with a cream sauce really tasted spot on.  To drink the waitress was really helpful with helping us pick a couple full body Reds that went with these Choice cuts well.  Good times!",

We ordered up an array of things so they can sample tastes of Paris.   Ordered French onion soup, lobster bisque, stake tar tare, foie gras..this was all very yummy. My son who's 14 loves trying new things.   I had a glass of cab with an 8oz fillet mignon w/ lobster tail, truffle fries, and Bacon with Brussel Sprouts. This was so yummy.   My son ordered scallops, my husband ordered NY steak, and my daughter who's 11 ordered the 8oz fillet mignon...this little girl loved the fillet so much She ate four ounces of mine too. So, to say if it was good..that's an understatement. It was grilled to perfection.   To end our night, we ordered the trio-chocolate macaroon, Coffee creme brulee \"so yummy!\" And a goat cheese dessert.    The service was so wonderful and gave us such a special night out with our kids. Thank you",

    "text": "Here is the 3-1-1:   Food: Michael Mina is mostly known for his seafood but his French style restaurant really has great flavors. For starters the Foie Gras parfait is definitely a shared appetizer as it is very rich for just one person. The foie gras is topped with a gelle that has a raspberry flavor and paired with perfectly toasted French bread; very rich but the foie gras flavor is suttle. Entrees included a roast chicken which I doubted at first but it was one of the best roasted chickens I ever had and was served with a mushroom bread pudding saute green beans. The salmon had a nice sear on the skin and was definitely pan roasted in butter as the fish was tender throughout. Accompanied with lentils that help balance the flavor. All in all both entrees were very rich as the portions were more than enough to not have room for dessert.  Service: Since it was a quiet week in vegas and our dinner time was early the number of staff was more than the number of diners so the service was great. Timing and recommendations was helpful and perfect.  Ambiance: Its vegas so the decor is classy and high end. Clean, elegant and since it was an early dining time the noise level was pleasantly quiet.",

We were told that only seats available were in the bar area, which was fine for us.     We shared charcuterie board, beet salad, and seared foie gras ( this is served only at dinner time but the server checked with the chef and said it was okay).   The beet salad with goat cheese was very good. I liked the bright colors of the beets and they tasted good.  The rest of the food was okay. Paying $29 for foie gras was not worth the money.  My $7 green tea had neither color nor taste.  Asked the server to bring me another pot but it was not much better.   Service was great.",

Drinks were 16 bucks each with a single giant block of ice which took up 70 percent of the volume.    As a local it's hard to see my city turning into such a service nightmare.  The unions are part of the problem.  Many employees in cruise control.  The hotel can't put the best people where they want because seniority rules and performance is an after thought.    Bardot is standard strip over priced stop.  Steer clear.",

Our server Clementine was not a good server and could only do one thing at a time.  In other words, she was shi!@$y. No other way to explain it.    We waited a good 15 min to order as we sat with menus in front of us and had to ask for coffee and water refills.  My favorite smoked salmon dish is now a pastrami cured salmon.  It's now served on a profiterole.  Dry and scraps of salmon.  So poor.  Don't order this if you loved their smoked salmon.  For $19, definitely not worth it.  Thank you Chef for your kind & courteous response.  I appreciate your thoughts and your commitment to excellence.    I know it's hard to remove and replace menu items.  The old smoked salmon was perfection.  There was so much thought put into the dish and each garnish was placed with perfection.  This new salmon does not stand up to the old one.  I'm not asking to bring back the old salmon, but wanted to share with you my thoughts on the new.   The salmon was dry.  I'm sorry.",

Everything was superb from the grand entrance set with beautiful pink roses, to the service, and most importantly, the food.  I love it when restaurants don't rush to bring you course after course, as the staff at BARDOT Brasserie allow you to take your time with your dinner and enjoy conversation.  BARDOT Brasserie did not disappoint in that sense.  We enjoyed a toasty warm French baguette, lobster bisque, shared haricots varts as our side dish, my husband had the lamb, and I had the steak frites.  Everything was served hot and DELISH!  We ended our birthday dinner with the most delicious chocolate macaroon filled with chocolate mousse ever.  Looking forward to dining at BARDOT Brasserie again soon!",

Tick off both boxes!  We were seated right away in the beautifully appointed bistro. Dimmed lighting gave it a really intimate feel. Our server was attentive and offered helpful suggestions on a cheese course starter--aged Mimolette will be your new favorite! The hubby had the pork chop and I had the sea bass-skin on by the way--nice touch. Both items were on point and worthy of the prices. Other menu items caught our eye, definitely something for everyone.  We were most impressed with the staff. Sharp and with high attention to detail. We were doubly impressed with a kind gesture we witnessed. The intimate room we were sitting in with a handful of patrons was suddenly and quietly rearranged to hold a boisterous group of 15. A cute couple had been seated just before the group arrived, and staff immediately recognized that their quiet evening together was doomed----although they had already ordered drinks, the couple was offered another table. It was a classy move and the hubby and I appreciated the effort for the couple.  You won't be disappointed at Bardot Brasserie-- we know we hit the Jackpot!!",

Brunch on the weekend is one of my fav times to come in.  I am definitely a Bardot regular so will steer you in the right direction.    BEST first!    HUNTER WAFFLES.. waffles w/ Duck Confit is to die for delish w/ the oozing poached egg & sauce maltaise on top.  A must!    WARM BEET & GOAT CHEESE SALAD!  Toasted hazelnuts, wild arugula & cassis vinaigrette.  Presentation & flavors are an A+ every time chef's.  I compare every beet salad to Bardot's.  The BEST LEMON MERINGUE!  Gorgeous.  All the elements are equally perfect.  My go-to dessert & I'm not a dessert person, if so it's usually chocolate.    PATE DE CAMPAGNE .. best I've ever had.  Beautiful traditional housemade pate w/ heritage pork, veal & pistachios w/ mustard. CHARCUTERIE comes w/ a nice half of the pate, Pork rillettes, saucisson sec, Bayonne ham & mustard.   Either one is perfect as an app or whole meal.  I've ordered it to-go for a lunch party at my house, which worked remarkably.  Paired w/ a nice bottle of wine & take your time enjoying.   ADD the Pastry & Breads as a side!  (See pic) OR  LE FROMAGE!  The cheese dish is phenomenal!  They change up, but my fav is the one I posted.  Toasted hazelnuts, Cremeux de Bourgogne, Epoisse de Berthaut, & Bleu de Causses, all cow, Secret de Compostelle (sheep) & Valencay Affino (goat).  MILLE FEUILLE Another amazing DESSERT!  Caramelized puff pastry, vanilla creme patisserie phenomenal.  Best, but first try the Lemon Meringue!  HEARTH BAKED QUICHE ... classic lorraine, bacon, kale, creamy delish!  Large slice & filling!    CROQUE MADAME pain de mie, Paris ham, gruyere fondue topped w/ the usual organic egg.  Over the weekend I asked if they could do a Salmon Monsieur, which turned out unbelievable!  Thank you chef's!  MAINE LOBSTER THERMIDOR over garlic mashed potatoes, mushrooms duxelles, fine herbs, smothered in sauce bearnaise.  Oh mmm!  A must!  FOIE GRAS PARFAIT thoroughly enjoy every melt-in-your-mouth moment.  Ruby port gelee on grilled country bread.  Savory & sweet for brunch or dinner!  Top 5.  CREME BRULEE.. vanilla bean custard, turbinado croquant, all I need to say.  Mmm!  AMERICAN IN PARIS .. a large more traditional breakfast w/ a square Crispy hashbrowns, sausage, scrambled eggs & toast.  Fantastic!  LE STEAKBURGER... if you're in the mood for a tender Prime Rib Patty, soft bun, comte cheese, garlic aioli, watercress, hand-cut fries, side of bordelaise onions & lettuce.    SMOKED SALMON BRIOCHE chive mascarpone, traditional garnitures.  Everything to love!    PRIME STEAK TARTARE ground-to-order, sauce verte, egg yolk & toasted baguette!    FRENCH TOAST is not only picture worthy, like everything here, but enormous.  Brioche French toast w/ vanilla mascarpone, a crunchy nut brittle & orgeat syrup!  Definitely shareable & my whole fix for the year it's so decadent.    KING CRAB CREPE... mmm the buckwheat crepe, black Truffle mushroom, sunny side-up egg, cider beurre blanc... disappointing if you don't mix it all together w/ the crab & get the full flavors, even w/ the green apple.  ESCARGOT BARDOT wild burgundy snails, toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse garlic butter in puff pastry shells.  Beautiful if you're a fan.    LOBSTER BENEDICT W/ KALE... Can't go wrong with Lobster or the Benedict.   CHICKEN FRENCH DIP.. gruyere cheese, mushroom bread pudding, haricot verts, vin jaune au jus.  Almost taste like Chicken Thanksgiving, but my least favorite.  Tad bit mushy & maybe less of an ingredient.    If you like fish, I've tried these two, neither was fantastic, just ok.  I think Bardot has better dinner items.    HERB-CRUSTED ALASKAN COD.. The English peas, sweet corn, saffron beurre blanc give it a nice lite touch.  LOUP DE MER.. roasted Mediterranean Sea bass, caramelized lemon, fennel, steamed potatoes.    Yes, an extensive review that is a year overdue.  There's also a drink call 'And God Created Woman' that's unique along w/ other & a wonderful wine list.  Michael Mina never fails & the chef's are Food Network stars to me.",

I was pleasantly surprised that the managers special on this night was Dover Sole, my absolute favorite! Absolutely, hands down, the best I have ever tasted! My husband ordered a pork chop for which he was very pleased with. Sizes are well proportioned, presented beautifully and most importantly, so yummy! Knowing we were dining that particular occasion for our anniversary, our waitress also delivered a plate of variety deserts! Again, I love the attention to detail and the amazing customer service shown, they definitely went above and beyond. I would love another opportunity to dine here when I venture back to the strip!",

I'll get right to it...we ordered the cheese plate and octopus to start...we let the server pick out the three different types of cheese and were very happy with her selection. The octopus was tender as was applied by chorizo and beans...super yummy!  For our entrees we ordered the Branzino and the scallops.  I'm not sure I could pick a favorite because they were both delicious.  For our sides we ordered the mushrooms (yummy!!!') and the Brussels sprouts.  I was not too impressed with the sprouts because they had a lot of vinegar by the mushrooms...craveable.  I will be i Vegas again in a week and even though it's pricey (but so are all of the good Vegas restaurants) I will probably be going back for those scallops and mushrooms!",

    "text": "The only bad thing about going to BARDOT Brasserie is it is impossible to decide what to choose from the wide range of unique, highly thoughtful offerings. Our party of four went for Sunday Brunch. Immediately we were poured delicate glasses of a dry, sparking Rose (bottomless at brunch). The service is old school French sophistication with a touch of American warmth. For appetizers, we selected a variety of dishes for all to try including king crab stuffed baby endive and prime steak tartare. Yum! Entrees were awesome. I had the Short Rib Benedict- a croissant with poached egg, sauteed kale and bearnaise covered tender short rib - a choice I'd definitely recommend for Brunch.  Michael Mina's restaurants always deliver memorable experiences and brunch today at the BARDOT in the Aria Resort was no exception. Just one suggestion, if you want Brunch make advance reservations - its a well known hotspot in Vegas.",

The Host was wonderful, the lead and other waiters were very welcoming, but our waiter looked like he was having a bad night. We were very kind and we understand it happens, you get rude guest sometimes who think they're entitled. But the moment we took our drink order and we just wanted a bottle of sparkling water and we DID NOT want an alcoholic beverage his demeanor changed. How do I know? Because I use to be a server myself, and I knew people like him. They think, Oh they must be cheap they just want water... NO, we have a 2 year-old sir and I know I'm only 32 but my husband doesn't drink and we are very responsible parents.  - Our finished plates were not cleaned off of our table. So I ended up piling the plates up myself and giving them to our server.  - we ordered Truffle fries, and we took the rest home; GOT home and today we see regular fries in our Togo box. So we either got someone else's fries or we pissed him off some how and he gave us plain fries. That's cross contamination you know that right?!   So Mr. CHRISTOPHER S.!!! Just so you know my husband and I own a mental health company, we make 6 figures a year and have enough to buy everything on the menu if we wanted to. My husband and I are healthy people, we don't drink, so I'm so sorry we ordered a soup and Lobster salad. My mother-in-law did have the salmon, which was AMAZING by the way. But yeah, please don't wear your heart on your sleeve at work because you don't know everyone's story.   I hope you guys hear us out because with an extravagant restaurant, such as Bardot, EVERYONE should have exceptional service.   Thank You",

    "text": "A charming place!  From the moment you walk up to it, the facade with the cafe tables outside instantly create a lovely environment.  My husband and I sat at the bar and had great conversation with the bartender Joe.  We originally went just for some cocktails and to scope out the place: - And God Created Woman - a subtle drink with a very fancy \"B\" embedded into the foam.  Almost too pretty to drink.  This one was pretty, but not very much flavor to it. - Le Detroit - again, they make these drinks look like art!  This one has flowers and an ice sphere that almost looks like it glows thanks to the green chartreuse.  The chartreuse is pretty strong on the palate, so if you don't like that liquor, I'd skip this one. - Notre Dame - by far my favorite.  It had a little bit of everything I like: gin, citrus flavor, and champagne.  It was like a kicked up French 75. - Man About Town - similar to a Negroni, but not as much spice.  Well, once the liquor started settling in, we got hungry, naturally: - Charcuterie - this dish is $25 and you do not get a lot of meat.  My husband is obsessed with charcuterie, so we've had it at many a restaurant, and the price is comparable to other restaurants, but the amount of meat is not.  It was delicious pate, prosciutto, salumi, and rillette...but a very small amount. - French Onion Soup - Oh man, this comes out covered in bubbly cheese and is a bit salty, but in a good way. - Mac and Cheese Gratinee - it's like a sculpted square of mac and cheese in this yummy, delicate sauce.  I liked it. - Chocolate Macaron - if you like chocolate, this will be your jam. - Strawberry Coupe Glacee - it was basically strawberry ice cream with crunchy, melt in your mouth meringue bits.  Pretty tasty.  What was really cool, though, was that Michael Mina himself came out to talk to some people at the bar and asked us how the food and drinks were.  Very cool getting to meet the man in charge of a restaurant empire!  I would definitely come again.  The bar was delightful, but the restaurant itself would make for a fabulous birthday/anniversary/special event dinner.",

The space is beautiful, food delicious, and price surprisingly reasonable given this is Vegas, on the strip, and a Michael Mina restaurant.  I ordered the 4-course summer tasting set, and I chose:  -Tuna Tartare: fresh, refreshing, and a little bit different than your usual tuna tartare with the additions of chopped olives -Scallops: delicious and sweet, although I tried my friend's choice of Duck L'orange wings for this course, and I would have ordered those instead. The wings were so tender, juicy, and flavorful and if I had been eating these at home by myself I probably would have done a much better job polishing off the wing. -Sea Bass: very generous serving and delicious, although a smidge on the plain side. My friends ordered the sole for this course and said it was amazing so I would have chosen that instead. -Strawberry Pavlova: Served with lavender ice cream a la mode and a tiny but fragrant piece of fresh lavender, this dessert was humongous and I could only finish the lavender ice cream before calling it quits.  My friends and I also shared the seared foie gras, foie gras parfait, and bone marrow. All extremely decadent and delicious, but I would have to choose the parfait as my favorite. It was creamy and savory, and I loved the Rose Port gelee that provided a tiny bit of tartness to the dish.  I would definitely come back and try their other dishes! They also have a daily Happy Hour (weekends included!) with some more casual fare like tartines, oysters, and tartares that could definitely be a meal.",

It was our last day and didn't want to be in the buffet line, way too long so I'm glad it forced us to go to Bardot :) We sat at the bar and got to look around, people watch ;)  Hubby got the steak brekkie and I got the lobster croissant benedict. OMGOMGOMG! I'm still day dreaming over it. Salivating as I type. It was perfect. Croissant was still crunchy, the sauce was divine, lobster pieces were generous. I wolfed it down! Oh so goooooood! I'm back in Vegas in Oct so I can't wait! I regrettably gave my hubby a bite. Even though I had a bite of his steak, the lobster benedict eclipsed the taste of the steak that I can't even remember what it was like.   I also noticed that they have lots of baked goods on display. I loved that they had canele. Yum! I'm grateful that the bartender let me try one as the display had not been changed. I got one worthy to play hockey with. He was very apologetic and appalled. He went to the kitchen and got fresh ones. Didn't get compensated but at least I got an apology.

    "text": "This place is an amazing gastronomic experience! We were at the Aria for a work conference and spoiled for choice, but this ended up being our favorite as evidenced by repeat visits. When you walk in the first thing that strikes you is the floor with these tiny tiles that I swear shimmer like diamonds. If you've ever done a DIY project, you know how much work goes into laying tiny tiles and that let me know right off the bat that I was in for a fine dining experience.  The hostesses are lovely, it didn't seem to matter whether we had a reservation or was simply walking in - they were gracious both ways. Walking in the bar is immediately to your left and it's set up beautifully. The ambience is so lovely, like an upscale Parisian bistro/cafe. The customer experience is also top notch and they are very much attuned to when to serve and when to interrupt.   Our dinner included:  French 75s: perfectly bubbly and lemony made! We asked for this drink at Alibi, Lift, Julian Serranos and none of them came close to Bardot's. Seriously, I had 4 in a row and did not pay the price in the morning.   Classic Shrimp Cocktail: certainly passable, but nothing special - the shrimp is large and the sauce seemed standard. I would liked a bit more horseradish to kick it up.   Charcuterie Board: this is an exquisite group appetizer with housemade pate, pork rillettes (similar to pate), saucisson sec (thick, dry cured sausage), and bayonne ham. It was served with crostini type bread and was unbelievably flavorful!  Onion Soup Gratinee: this includes classic beef broth, baguette crostini, cave-aged gruyere. I added the beef bourguignon and black truffle, & omitted the poached egg. This soup was everything onion soup should be: flavorful broth, super cheesy topping, caramelized onions, I could go on. It was spectacular and filling!  Roasted Beets & Caramelized Goat Cheese Salad: this came with roasted red/gold beets, wild arugula, toasted hazelnuts, and tossed in a cassis vinaigrette. The beets were delicious but the goat cheese came in a round block and it wasn't that appetizing once you deconstructed the salad. It was yummy, but I would prefer for them to add the goat cheese in chunks.   Double Cut Ribeye: oh my god, this cut of ribeye and the beef fat fries were simply unbelievable! I made the mistake of filling up on the onion soup before this and regret that decision to this day. But the half that I was able to consume was incredible. I can't remember what sauce I ordered on the side, but I didn't eat it because the steak needed no doctoring up.",

First, we booked the reservation after checking in at the ARIA, great hotel; terrible dining experience. We had a 10pm reservation and felt rushed to order and unimpressed with the menu. French... Not ! The floors are tiled so sound carries- very loud to the point we had to repeat ourselves to the waiter and could barely hear each other to hold a basic conversation. Sad... It was my boyfriend's birthday who's an executive chef and knows his cuisines. This place wasn't as french as we thought. Had to add salt to our meals and didn't even acknowledge his birthday..   Another fine dining restaurant on strip who provided a sample dessert with a gift from the chef.   Complained to the hotel rewards counter who sympathize for the terrible experience and offered a 50 dollar comp.. Thanks Aria-",

I feel like most of their items are great -amazing.   Their egg Benedict is amazing and they really stand out because instead of your regular english muffin, they used croissant as the  base where where they topped it off with the egg and ingredients. If you really wanna go ballin, I would say get the lobster(but they have 4 other choices: PARIS HAM,BEEF BOURGIGNON,SMOKED SALMON, SURF AND TURF) because it's just so damn good. However, I have finally tried their hunter's waffle which is amazing and it's pretty much another version of egg benedict but instead they have it w/ duck confit. The duck is so flavorful, tender, and tasty.  Some other recommendations would be mussels and frites, chicken french dip, french onion soup(make sure you add the perigord truffle, braised short rib & poached egg for a few extra bucks to really elevate the soup. I won't go into the mussels and frites which is self-explanatory but the chicken french dip is really good. Most of the dishes doesn't look like it comes w/ a lot but a lot of their dishes are really hearty and heavy that when you finished it, you would be full. The bread is so good, the chicken is so flavorful, the \"dip\" goes so well w/ it, the mushroom bread budding is lovely. The side of salad really helps with this dish considering it's so heavy.  Anyway, Bardot has become one of my favorite lunch/brunch place at a good price and very filling. I would recommend it to anybody who would ask me what to eat at vegas as a must.",

I ordered the tasting menu ($65) fir dinner, which consisted of:  Summer melon with cheese (fresh burrata), cantaloupe, honey dew, and a balsamic reduction. The fruit was amazingly sweet and the burrata paired so well with the fruit! It was soft, creamy and delicate.  A play on duck a l'orange, where duck breast was replaced with duck wings. They were tender and perfectly cooked. But! I wanted duck skin and did not get it. It was fine but less preferred. It came with 3 wings.   Sole meuniere...stop all the clocks.. lol. If you like fish, butter, and artichoke flavors, this dish is a must. I loved it! Little bit of capers, two fillets of sole rolled and placed on top of an artichoke puree... all tied together with butter.. it was tres tres perfect. This is a dish I'll remember for a while!   For dessert, the cherry clafoutis. They did not keep the cherry pits in (like traditional ones), but it was still yummy, if just a tad on the sweet side. I loved how It paired with the nutty and less sweet pistachio ice cream!   Now go!! Reservation not needed. :)",

My husband and I don't usually go out to brunch so we really felt spoiled here. First off, the bread is amazing! From the baguette to the incredible pastries. Let's not forget that amazing butter! We were feeling a bit adventurous and tried the escardots bardots and the foie gras parfait and were pleasantly surprised. If any chef can make me like those things, they have True talent! For the main course I ordered a prime rib French dip with truffle fries. The bread was so soft and wow, that mimolette cheese fondue was so good! My husband ordered the steak and eggs and loved it. He's hardly ever impressed with steak in restaurants but this one disappeared from his plate in no time. Then, to top it all off, we HAD to try the famous French toast. We were already so full but boy was it worth it! Probably the best French toast I've ever had. That's saying a lot because I don't like eggs and French toast is my go to breakfast choice. It was such a unique take with this beautiful vanilla marscarpone and almond brittle on top. Now I can't wait to come back to try that Nutella sticky bun that we missed. All in all, the staff was top notch and you can tell that the chef has a real passion for food. It most definitely did not disappoint!",

The set menu comes with 4 courses, and all of them are on the regular priced menu. I chose the summer melon (cheese was the highlight!), scallops (tender, but also heard great things about the duck wings), seabass (maybe my least favorite, but still very good), and the strawberry pavlova for dessert. Portions were hearty, but lots of attention to delivery.   We also separately ordered the foie gras parfait, the seared foie gras and the bone marrow to try. So decadent. All were delicious, but my favorite of the three would be the foie gras parfait, light and airy, a refreshing change to the usually dense foie gras pate.   Overall, great experience, great food, great ambience, great price, strongly recommend.",

This week we brought my mom and sister along and we once again had a fabulous meal.  We started with the charcuterie board which was absolutely delicious.  My mom had the scallops and my sister had the duck.  Both were cooked and seasoned to perfection.  However, the run away favorite of the evening was the beef wellington!  Their chicken is one of my favorites, but my husband loves beef wellington, and it was for 2 so I obliged.  I did not regret my decision. It is, without a doubt, the best we have ever had. It is no exaggeration.  The puff pastry was golden and crispy on the outside while the fillet was perfectly medium well.  The prosciutto, mushroom dexelles, accompanying sauce we're complimentary and not overpowering or too rich.  As a side note, it says it's for 2 but would easily feed 3-4.  Not wanting to let it go to waste, we ended up eating more than we would normally!  The downside of that is that we had no room for dessert.  Love their chocolate macaron, but just couldn't do it.  If there is anything I would criticize, it's that the room is rather loud.  But who cares about that when you have this wonderful food to concentrate on.",

The dining room looks beautiful as well, so I would recommend reserving a table for larger parties or for a more intimate night out.  The duck a l'orange is fantastic! So rich, tender, and fall off the bone delicious. It's maltaise sauce is beautifully presented in a hollowed mini orange, & it's so creamy with an amazing yet subtle flavor. The onion soup gratinee is everything I wanted it to be - soft caramelized onions and baguette in a rich brown broth, all topped with a generous amount of gruyere. Perfect!

    "text": "Came here for brunch with a few friends and we all enjoyed most of our time here. The king crab crepe with trumpet mushrooms and egg was very rich and flavorful, a can't miss. The Nutella sticky bun was a big portion and delicious as well. We all thought the smoked salmon with brioche was just okay, although the chive mascarpone that came with it was great. We all enjoyed our main courses except one, who ordered her steak medium rare but received it pretty well done (pictured). Service was a tad bit slow as we waited at least ten minutes to put a drink order in. But that didn't deter us from having a good time. Overall, we enjoyed everything, but if I came back, I would want to try their dinner menu.",

The beef wellington was the size of a football, it could probably feed 4 ppl. The lamb chops were good but were not Frenched correctly since I kept spitting up pieces. The services is very slow, I feel like they had one waiter working the whole place. We had to beg for drinks and the food took forever to bring out. But everything was  tasty, there is room for improvement but I would come back for sure!",

    "text": "This review is for their 2016 Las Vegas Restaurant Week $80 menu.  Bardot is both a solid brunch and dinner spot. The food is delectable, and the service is unpretentious.   The three-course Las Vegas Restaurant Week menu may be more than enough food, but I'd suggest ordering an extra appetizer or two to share.  Appetizer - Escargots Bardot: Can't stand the sight of SNAILS? Well, these are wrapped in a puff pastry. These are savory, buttery, and delicious -- you can't eat just one.   Appetizer - Seared Foie Gras Lyonnaise: If you've ever tried Filipino-style adobo, the sauce in this dish has a familiar adobo flavor to me. I wasn't a fan of the beluga lentils, but I liked the combination of foie gras and the prune confiture.   First Course - King Crab Crepe: A crab and black trumpet mixture folded into a buckwheat crepe with a sunny side egg right in the center. Yum.  Second Course - Maine Lobster Thermidor: Truthfully, I'm not a fan of lobster, but I gave this a try any way and it was delicious. This was my first time trying this dish, and it reminded  me of a \"dynamite\" that you can order at some Japanese restaurants. I loved the mixture of the mushrooms, bernaise sauce, and the tender chunks of lobster meat. The creamy mashed potatoes were bomb; I wish I had a bowl of just that on the side.   Third Course - Chocolate Macaron: Rich and decadent. This is a deluxe version of a regular macaron. Sandwiched in between chocolate cookies were dollops of chocolate mousse. Chocolate sauce and chocolate shavings topped it off.   For French cuisine on The Strip, Bardot's my top pick. I cannot wait to return.",

    "text": "Details matter. From every aspect of the decor to the carefully curated menu, Bardot Brasserie has been thoughtfully presented.   The atmosphere is a joy to be in, reminiscent of many bistros and brasseries in France albeit less worn and perfectly new obviously built with a nice budget!   This was my second visit, last April my wife and I enjoyed their weekend brunch which on the plus side did offer more variety including wonderful fresh baked croissants and bottomless rose which both were not available on this visit.   This time around we were with our children and friends mid week. The restaurant wasn't too busy but the menu offering wasn't as grand.   The sourdough baguette with butter imported from France is worth the extra spend. One thing i especially enjoy when going to France is the silky rich butter with a much higher fat content than we eat. Treat yourself!   I had the onion soup gratinee which although good is a 7/10 if you've had other great ones. We live in Montreal which enjoys a French culture and there are better soups to compare this with. I will however say that it is the best in recent memory stateside. The quality of gruyere was nice and salty with a perfect crust on top and just the right amount of chew, the broth lacked some richness and there was way too much bread that soaked up a good amount of the broth.   My wife had the Maine lobster nicoise and was very pleased. The baby gem lettuce was thoughtfully assembled on the plate with a large plump lobster claw front and center.   Two of our party enjoyed the French herb omelette. It was incredibly cooked without a blemish or burnt spot to be seen and perfectly rolled. A few of us discussed how they prepared it, with butter in the egg or just at very low heat in a non stick pan. The side salad that accompanied the omelette was crisp and delicious and also thoughtfully assembled with all leaves pointing upward. The hash brown, was a little too dense and dry but could not put a damper on what was otherwise perfection.   There was a croque madame and steak burger all enjoyed as well but what stood out was believe it or not a side dish that my daughter had! The macaroni mimolette gratinee is not to be missed! In essence haute Mac and cheese, it is presented as what looks like a slice of toast but is in fact macaroni noodles perfectly assembled in soldier position with a delicious cheese crust on top. The square of noodles is beautifully placed on a bed of bechamel sauce, and in addition to the presentation, the taste is divine and incredibly rich.   While not French, chef Michael Mina has in my view made the French proud and that is not easily attainable lol!   I highly recommend the food, the decor and the experience for a non rushed beautiful meal but be prepared to pay a heavy price.",

I will say that disappointment was eased when I walked into Bardot Brasserie for brunch one day with the ladies.   Home to the Everlasting Rose, this is brunch on another level. This brunch is elevated. Rose is one way to stand out on Champagne Sunday! There's lots of light, and there's some wonderful dishes including croissant benedicts in lobster and surf & turf varieties.   For a decadent French onion soup, try adding the perigord truffle, braised short rib & poached egg. It's mouthwateringly good.",

    "text": "I've been here twice for the weekend brunch and this would be one of my favorite French restaurant. Chef Michael Mina did a great job on the variety of menu it has to offer. Let's start with complimentary french bread that is toasty on the exterior and soft on the inside with house butter.   Appetizers: french onion soup with truffle, shortrib, poached egg, and gruyere cheese - This is goood $16 bowl of french onion which taste so home -made and delicious. The beef broth was not salty and doesnt taste like it's from the can beef broth. It's not heavily dumped with onions. This is one darn good bowl of french onion soup.   steak tartare - it was good and fresh, but i've had better. It comes in half or full order.   escargot - Nicely presented and the escargot is wrapped in pastry puff.   French toast with vanilla mascarpone and almond brittle - This is a huge brick of bread! Literally, it's probably about 2.5inches thickness and 4x6inches in length/width. I was only able to eat half of the french toast. Outside is toasty, but the inside was soft and quite mushy, but tasty. It's not your typical french toast.   Burger with aioli fries - Juicy, huge, and tasty! the fries is a must have!  Ham croissant benedict - Interesting combo and the sauce was delish!  Hunter waffle with duck confit - It 's a good plain waffle atop with duck confit. It was just okay.   Apple tart - Not your typical apple pie or tart, but it's really good. Not soo sweet, but full of apple flavor.   Vanilla creme brulee - Full of vanilla flavor and creamy! One of the better creme brulees!  I would definitely return to try the happy hour menu in the bar area next time i'm in town!!",

    "text": "Came here for Mother's Day brunch. Would recommend this place, as it had a pretty extensive and unique French menu compared to some other places.   AMBIENCE = Great! Beautiful brasserie.  SERVICE = Great, generally attentive.  FOOD REVIEW:  COMPLIMENTARY BAGUETTE & SALTED BUTTER They give you a baguette loaf for 2 people. Salted butter is nicely whipped and creamy.  ESCARGOTS BARDOT: toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse garlic butter, puff pastry shells --- Pretty good; wish there was a bit more garlic butter flavor though... but it wasn't greasy at all.  HAND CUT TRUFFLE FRIES (no photo) --- Could hardly taste the truffle... wasn't worth the price.  KING CRAB CREPE: buckwheat crepe, black trumpet mushrooms, sunny-side egg, normandy cider beurre blanc --- It was ok. I'm not sure I'm a fan of the taste, but my mom really enjoyed it.   BARDOT STEAK & EGGS: prime rib eye, two fried eggs, hash browns, sauce verte  --- I didn't try it but the steak seemed pretty good. Tried a bit of the hash brown and I didn't like it. Tasted like dry cardboard with some herbs.  HUNTER'S WAFFLE: glazed duck confit, poached eggs, sauce maltaise --- I didn't get to try this, but looks decent.  FRENCH TOAST: brioche french toast, vanilla mascarpone, almond brittle, orgeat syrup --- Wow, epic french toast! Really well done! Even though the toast was really thick, it had a nice bread pudding consistency to it (i.e. not dry at all, not too bready) and when you take a bite with the mascarpone and almond syrup... WOW... Amazing combination! Strongly recommend it and highlight of the meal.   DOUBLE-CUT BACON (no photo) --- Didn't try this but brothers were impressed with it. Compared this to smokey brisket.  SMOKED SALMON CROISSANT BENEDICTS: two poached eggs, sauteed kale, bearnaise --- Looked amazing, but smoked salmon was way too salty. Wish there was a bit more kale to offset the saltiness. But overall I enjoyed this and love that it's on a croissant pastry.  MILLE FEUILLE: caramelized puff pastry, vanilla creme patisserie --- Mmmm... so good!!! The puff pastry was so crispy and flakey. Really delicious. Highly recommend it.",

I couldn't decided between the escargots, foie gras, or bone marrow, but after some thinking, I decided to go with the bone marrow.  That was a great choice!  I've had bone marrow elsewhere.  In some places, I've gotten bone that are large but with little marrow.  This one had smaller bones, but generous portions of marrow! The bone marrow comes in two pieces and 3 slices of toasted bread.  You use the marrow to spread on the bread...like butter and yes, better than butter!!  If it's your first time having bone marrow ever, or if you're not a fan of the bone marrow taste itself, I'd recommend using the side of caramelized onions.  The caramelized onions will take over the bone marrow taste.  Got the mussels for the entree.  The light garlic buttery wine sauce was flavorful, and it didn't feel too buttery.  The only disappointment was the size of the mussels.  I'm used to large jumbo mussels almost as big as oysters, but these mussels were just slightly bigger than clams.  Regardless, they tasted excellent.    I'd like to come back to try the escargots and the foie gras!",

Spent $400 ($300 plus tip) since we were there on a special occasion (our 10th anniversary), but everything was so salty I barely had any room for the food because I was downing a cup of water between every bite. Every bite was like a straight sip from a salt shaker: the bread with the fancy butter that cost extra on top of the free bread and butter, the seafood tower, the lamb chops, and the steak with foie gras. It was so depressing because I was so full from water I couldn't finish my half of the foie gras (we shared everything). The giant macaron dessert was fun. I was concerned that it was kind of gimmicky but it was a decent macaron, with crisp, delicate outsides and perfect feet.  Should have stayed in LA and gone to the Arroyo Chop House in Pasadena where they make me a perfectly seasoned blue rare steak every time, and we eat like kings for $150. Too bad Fusion closed down; their steak with foie gras was orgasmic.",

When we first arrive to BARDOT, we sat in our seats for good 10-15min before a server or even a busser came in greet us or asking us for drinks. (I feel that even 10min is bit too long for us just sit there without any greeting or asking us what we like to drink) We had to signal the waiter for us to even see us. The worst part was that the place was fairly empty (which is unusual for BARDOT for saturday brunch) except for the one big birthday party in the corner. However the our waiter did awknlodge the fact that it did take them really long time to take our order. We ordered the  BARDOT breakfast sandwhich, (which was pretty much bigger version of egg mcmuffin) it was way too heavy and and salty. I also got the crossaint smoked salmon egg benedict, and that was good. But right when I was about to use my kniffe to cut the egg, all my utensils were covered in butter, (someone either not clean the utencils or just left it there. As I ask for new utensils, even our waiter mentioned \"we are def messing up on you guys today, I apologized\". And As we were eating, there was group of 4 came and sat next to us, and they too  were sitting there for good 15 minutes before the server came and awknolodge them. It took them 20 min to get their food. I can tell everyone in that table were confused to why the service was so slow when there was barely anyone in the restaruant. I felt the management of the restaurant was poorly managed because I can see that lot of the waiters had to attend the big birthday party which cause to neglect the other paying customers. The service and food was really only one star. Another restaurant in ARIA that I'm really disappointed, especially because it was one of my go to for brunch!",

My wife decided to have the Alaskan King Crab and Macaroni & Mimolette gratinee as entrees. It was a delight, as I was told. My Oak-Smoked Duroc Pork Chop, was super tender and full of flavor. Pretty smoky though, as advertised. The bartenders and wait staffs were not perfectly fluid, in the way they engage, anticipate my needs and communication. Just a bit rough around the edge. Just need slightly more training to make this restaurant top notch! But Overall a good meal...",

When some came to the table, it was to remove the plates.   Therefore, I didn't get to have an edible meal.   I will not return and will not recommend it.  It was a very bad lunch experience.  As a follow up, I have received a reply from the restaurant and feel they are very apologetic about the situation.  I will give them another opportunity in the future.",

The flower decoration inside the restaurant is really pretty too. We went in for the sunday brunch for the restaurant's famous french toast.  Food is good. Service is professional. We had the almost $25 frenchy toast and the almost $25 french omelet. Frenchy toast is enough to share amongst 3 people. It's a huge block of bread with huge scoop of better/cream and almond glazed garnish on top. Inside french toast is so moist I think they put a lot if eggs and butter. It's so soft and goes well with the cream on top. But the dish is so heavy with all heavy flavors. French omelet was a bit disappointing compared to the french toast though. It was served very nicely, clean looking but the omelet was basically just rolled egg and the hash brown was hash rock. It was so hard we couldn't chew it. Drinks here were nice as well though.   The whole experience really great. Definitely worth a visit in Vegas.",

I was promptly served and the food was fantastic! I ordered the Parisian Gnocchi and that should really be renamed to Parisian PILLOWS.

    "text": "Dinner at Bardot Brasserie was one of my favourite meals in Las Vegas. They are managed by Mina group, who specializes in creating and operating high end restaurants, led by Chef Michael Mina. The servers were well-trained and patiently took their time to explain each dish, providing us with recommendations. We ordered 2 mains and 1 appetizer  Freshly grounded Steak tartare ($24): prime filet, egg yolk, sauce verte, potato chip Beef tartare is one of those simple dishes that are extremely hard to master since there are only a few simple ingredients; the simpler the ingredients, the less room there is for hiding. The beef must be top quality and have a good balance of meat-to-fat ratio, which can make or break the dish. It was a very addicting dish and we could have ate it all day, but we wanted to eat the entrees, too. Flavour: 9/10  Double Cut Pork Chop ($49): oak-smoked duro pork, bacon lardons, root vegetables, red pearl onions, horseradish pomme puree, grain mustard beurre blanc Porkchop for an entree is out of my comfort zone, but it was recommended by our waitress so I gave it a try. The flavours of this dish weren't bad, although it could use some acidity to cut down the fat a little, and the extra bacon lardon wasn't necessary. The pork chop was a little tough for me. I think they could improve a little on the cooking time for it. Flavour: 4/10 Scallops Veronique ($51): Roasted cauliflower, sultana raisins, broccoli spigarello, caper brown butter, perigord verjus, and preserved lemon. Hands down best dish of the evening. All of the scallops were jumbo-sized. Each one was seared to perfection. The brown butter brings out the sweetness of the tender scallops. I will say I had hoped for a prettier dish. I think they can put more effort on the plating since Bardot is an up-scale venue. Flavour: 9/10  Total: $124 USD Flavour Averages: 7 Value: 6 Service: 8",

Our two favorite things on the menu are the heritage chicken and the diver scallops, which are both very tasty and cooked to perfection. The service is always great no matter how busy they are, which is to be expected at such a nice place.   My only issue is it can get pretty loud, as they do have a tv at the bar. I'd suggest requesting one of the more secluded areas or at least a table where the television is not in view. To me, it's just not fitting to pay $200 for a meal (for 2) while watching a sporting event on the tele. It just doesn't go, at least not for me.   Aside from that, everything is ALWAYS amazing which is why we return, but more importantly venture to the strip. If you're a Vegas local, you'll understand that statement.",

We showed up early and were told it would be closer to 12:15 (totally fine that was our res time)....we get sat at 12:47 at a tiny table in the bar room which is right across from where waiters pick up drinks from bartenders. It wouldn't be a problem really but there were 4 open two tops in the restaurant (one of which was right on the other side of us and stayed open the entire brunch)  So on to ordering, we were interested in the \"world's best butter\" and asked what it came with, the waitress scoffed \"bread\" and then laughed and said we offer bread and butter free you really don't need to get that...what the heck?! We ordered it anyway. We also got a breakfast sandwich and the croissant Benedict with prosciutto. Plus beers from their really excellent selection of draft beers.   The butter was fun, but comes w cold hard bread (which is the same as the complimentary bread.) the breakfast sandwich was so bad it was actually funny. It comes with one of those pre-cooked egg pucks (see pic ) and tastes exactlylike an egg McMuffin according to my husband. The Benedict was ok minus the spinach which was clearly frozen then reheated and was not seasoned at all.   I could go on but I really don't need to, we would have ordered more beers but the waitress just told us \"she would be right back with our check\" when the table was bused...over all: rude service, bad food, and a really disappointing experience.",

Two of us ordered the special of the day, which was prime rib. I had the filet mignon well done and it was perfect! My other friend ordered gnocchi, which was a great vegetarian option. My friends shared duck wings and oysters, but I didn't partake. They were all raving about the oysters. My starter was mediocre -  I've had better beet salads. For dessert, the descriptions threw my friends for a loop. The espresso creme brulee was a bit overwhelming, but the beignets were decent. We were not expecting the cheesecake to look or taste like it did. I think it was too creamy or lemony?! My chocolate macaron on the other hand was stellar!!",

The octopus was a bit salty though, and service wasn't that great. However the manager did comped us a few desserts to make up for the poor service.",

We are very fond of the service and food at Eiffel Tower restaurant but we both had to admit that this one took the cake. You simply must try the escargot, the 'pop tarte' and the fois gras with short rib. I have never been so happy to have leftovers the next day",

    "text": "Wow, talk about an overhyped restaurant that seems to be rated high because of the atmosphere. It's always hard to tell reviews in Las Vegas because I figure people can be drunk when deciding over food quality. I was famished when I came to BARDOT but the food was so subpar that even in that state of being, my tastebuds could not be tricked into submission. The only thing I can say is that their butter with hot bread was the best- and now I know they have announced that on their menu for a reason: to assure you that something here does make it worthwhile.   Loup De Mer Au Fenoil: $56. This Dish smelled distinctly. The Sea Bass was flaky but tasted like nothing. There was only one fingerling potato buried under the fish along with one artichoke. The flavors clashed: I felt like I was eating boiled fish and when I tried to put it in the sauce/juice the sourness was overpowering. Could not taste any subtle taste in this fish. I went home hungry and kept thinking I was eating Lean Cuisine. it was that bad.  Bone In Strip: $61 . Apparently was good, we had a comparison for two other steak restaurants on the strip and this did not compare those those and was $10 more expensive  Brussel Sprouts: $14 - it was okay  Chickpea Frites: $15 - the dip was the only thing great about this  King Crab & Endive Salad: $20+ range. Another uneventful dish that lacked substance and taste. Our rep finished it only because he was hungry.  Bardot Salad: $17 - okay.   The food quality was so bad that I will not come back here again- no matter how the service is. I went over to Paris to get some dessert since I was too scared to try it here - needed to get rid of the taste in my mouth.   As a positive their bathrooms are fancy.",

I felt like I was in a Brasserie in France. The decor the lighting, superb.   Everyone was very polite and professional. There is nothing bad to say other than fine tuning the attention to detail.

Thrilled to see that the restaurant was able to accommodate us.   Service: our server was Mr. Grumpy pants at first but he did warm up later in the evening. He was pretty short with our table and kept leaving our table when we were in mid sentence. Like I said he got better throughout the night.   Food: was really really good. I think I enjoyed the food this time around than I did last time. We started off with the seafood tower of assortments. I think it was one of the best towers I've seen. I had the chicken with the mushroom bread pudding. Amazing. The chicken was cooked beautifully. NOT DRY. Thank you!  Can never go wrong w Brussel sprouts. They were really good.   Also to people who like butter. I'd get their worlds best butter. It's starkly different than the regular butter they serve with the baguettes. The worlds best butter is less salty? More smooth and has a nice scent to it.   Recommend grabbing a drink at their bar. Which has a nice display. Then grab a bite to eat! Nice ambience, it tends to be pretty loud so heads up!",

I came on the later side of brunch hours so to maximize the deal she gave me a to-go cup to take with me to the pool. Awesome!  French toast with foie gras - All the pics made this look so amazing, but I was gravely disappointed. Sure it's a thick slice of bread, but that's about it. Where's all the flavor? If the bread itself was good I wouldn't have had such an issue (think Asian bakery). Alas, it was more akin to plain white toast. The marscapone and brittle on top barely added to the dish and the foie gras made me sick.   Overall, great service but I'd shy away from the french toast.",

I've had my experiences and wanted to add BARDOT to the list . Our server was wonderful and greeted us right away and assured us our glasses would never be empty ! And she was right !! Such a sweetie, she had a French accent and made our experience delightful . Me and my bf sat in the bar area , it was perfect as the restaurant is pretty open and it's gorgeous inside ! The bar is mesmerizing , rose gold everything ! My entree of choice was the scrambled eggs with lobster . It was delicious but I wish I got something else at the end . The eggs were a bit dry. Otherwise they serve you a hot mini banquette with butter and I suggest doing the bottomless rose !",

    "text": "Visited Bardot on demands of friends and wife, which they had visited on their prior trip.  Trusting their palettes, I decided to do zero research and opted to not put up a fight on restaurant selection.  Verdict?  Best brunch experience thus far in Vegas!  Complimentary mini baguettes came in these paper baggies along with a dish of pearly butter.  The best way to start your journey at Bardot - tear into that bread and smell that freshly-baked wonder, and spread that butter across the steamy soft center.  Moules frites:  the classic Belgium dish of mussels and fries.  The mussels were so tender and fresh (best I've had in years).  There's always the option of upping your game by going with truffle fries (so damn good...).  The best part of the dish?  Soaking that complimentary baguette with the pungent vermouth mussel juice in the pot!  French toast:  made with a block of tasted brioche, the French toast came with generous serving of vanilla mascarpone, almond brittles, and hearty almond syrup.  A beautiful piece of work that we were afraid to cut into.  We ended up spending more time gazing at the golden brick than devouring it.  Crunchy on the outside while buttery and soft on the inside.    One of the best dining experiences we had in Vegas for sure!  Look forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "Blown away. This was the best brunch i've ever had.  Should you start with the bottomless sparking rose? Yes, you should. My brother and I both got that, and I would venture to guess, that between the two of us, we went through at least two bottles and change. The waitress just kept coming over and topping us off; I don't think we actually ever had completely empty glasses.  Carbs? Yep. If you're jumping on the bottomless train, you best supplement with breads of many varieties. We got the basket of bread/pastries, a basket of sourdough, as well as \"the world's best butter\" - I think between this carb-festival and the rose, I could have stopped right there.  But did we? Of course not. We also HAD to start with the Nutella cinnamon bun to get that initial fat explosion we needed to really get our metabolisms going. We divided that up between all of us, because only a crazy person (or someone with an iron stomach) could house that whole thing themself.  From there, you can't really go wrong with what you order. Our table had some salmon, some french toast, and steak and eggs floating around, and they were all fantastic. I had the steak and eggs, which was grass fed NY beef (local for me, less so for LV) nice and rare, with perfectly over easy eggs and fat sourdough to soak it all up.  This easily outdoes any NYC/NJ brunch i've ever had - where else can you get bottomless sparking French rose for $25?  Again, not the cheapest meal you'll eat, but most certainly worth every penny. Next time I am in Vegas, Aria or not, I will be back.",

The Foie Gras here served two ways, both as delectable and decadent as they come. The Beluga Lentils an interesting yet fitting combination, the parfait variety a MUST have every visit!  The surprising winner here being an out of this world Creekstone Prime Rib, putting to shame anything that you've yet encountered with the prime rib label. Both flavor, texture and welcomed array of accompanying sauces putting to rest any preconceived perception of the classic dish. Order!  The Smoked Salmon Paris Brest taking same route, with an explosion of flavor and balance of taste, jading every lox and bagel forward. The caviar elevating even further and Chive Mascarpone adding a subtle sweetness and fresh bite.  And last but not least, the new Beef Wellington for Two, a generous portion, arguably enough for Four, with a fair spread of other enjoyables. Delicate beef wrapped in Prosciutto, cooked in a flaky puff pastry and stuffed with Mushroom Duxelles and soaked in Foie Gras-Madeira Veloute. Mouthwatering!

    "text": "I'd previously dined at Bardot Brasserie back in March on my last trip to Las Vegas and was unimpressed.  Not one to be deterred, the wife and I went there to see if happy hour on a Monday evening was a better experience.  While we didn't take advantage of the happy hour drink specials (I had a regular priced cocktail, a Vieux Carre instead), we did partake in the food off of the HH menu.  We shared orders of the Prime Steak Tartare and the Braised Short Rib Tartine.  I'll admit without any shame that I'm a cocktail snob.  My drink possessed all of the expected notes of the classic Vieux Carre, however, it didn't seem properly chilled.  Since it didn't taste over-diluted, I can only guess that either my drink wasn't sufficiently stirred or it was served in warm rocks glass.   Either way, it wasn't as cold and as good as it should've been.  Our food was, similarly, hit or miss.  The steak tartare was served on thin, waffle-cut, potato chips.  It was tender, meaty, and flavorful.  It was a hit with us.  The Braised Short Rib Tartine was an unfortunate miss.  The braised short rib on the tartine was rich in flavor, moist and tender.  It was made even richer with the fried egg that also came atop the tartine.  The downfall of the dish was the bread itself, which was overbaked, required sawing through it with a knife to cut it into halves for sharing, tough, and very chewy.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine and it wasn't worth the time and hassle of sending it back.  Still, for whatever reasons, in my experience, Bardot Brasserie continues to be the outlier in an otherwise excellent group of Michael Mina restaurants in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "On the way to Zion National Park for our 10th anniversary, my husband and I thought it'd be fun to stay a night at the Aria just to break up the drive from Peoria where we live. We always stay at the Aria, and I've seen so many photos and reviews that I was inspired to try this place for dinner. I'll admit, it was an odd night for a celebration, a Wednesday night at around just after 9pm, when it's close to closing I'm assuming. The restaurant was fairly open, except for a few people grabbing drinks at the bar, and maybe two other couples and one small group. There was no hostess originally at the entrance, so we awkwardly looked around. The friendly bartender assured us someone would soon be with us, and eventually after maybe 10 minutes, we were rescued and finally guided to a table.  Our waitress was super nice. She grabbed my cocktail order, Le Peche Mode. Cute name, so the cocktail just had to be good... It had Hennessy, peach cream, lemon, ginger and mint. I'm not the biggest fan of mint, but luckily it was subtle. I enjoyed it much more than the Lime in Da Abricot, which also had cognac, apricot puree, and mint. While waiting for my cocktail to make its presence, we were given a French bread baguette in a paper bag lightly toasted and served with non melted butter. It wasn't pre sliced so we made a hell of a mess breaking it apart and sharing it. Our bad...   The Escargots Bardot consisted of wild burgundy snails wrapped in puff pastries, and they were toasted with hazelnuts sprinkled on top and delicately bathed in chartreuse-garlic butter. The pastry was very light and perfect. We really loved this appetizer.   The Steak Tartare had freshly ground prime filet with egg yolk served with gaufrette potato chips. This was my husband's choice, because he is a sucker for most tartares, and this one did not disappoint. The salty chips fit well with the raw filet meat.   Since I'm a huge fan of Branzino type fish, it was a no brained for me to try the Loup de Mer Au Fenouil. It had roasted Mediterranean Sea bass, caramel iced lemon, fennel, and fingerling potatoes. It looked exactly like the photo in our hotel room advertisement for Bardot. It was also perfectly done not only in aesthetics but in taste.   My husband ordered the double cut pork chop. It was oak smoked pork with bacon lardons, root veggies, horseradish potato puree and grain mustard bearer bland. Funny enough, this was also featured on the advertisement for Bardot in our hotel room, but I swear, we ordered these 2 entrees without even seeing the advertisement. I just recognized the 2 entrees' photo when we returned to the room!   The food is absolutely close to phenomenal especially as far as how the escargot and the Loup de Mer. Our waitress was really good and friendly especially for working late on a Wednesday night, a slower night. I think what got to me was the long waits we encountered. We waited a while to sit down and there seemed like too much time between dishes. If it had been a weekend, then I'd totally understand, but it really didn't seem like that were that many people there. There was a photographer there too with an assistant, nabbing memorable photos of the night. It was just slightly on the pushy side with posing our photos for us, and then they returned at the end of dinner to present us with prints of our photos. It was around $100 or so to get the prints and that's only a select few of the prints. She was right... it was our 10th anniversary so we were suckered into getting some.. It was still awkward though.   If we return, it'd just be to grab a cocktail and maybe some of the escargot pastries again.",

    "text": "My family and I had been dying to try brunch at Bardot Brasserie, we had heard so many great things and decided to take grandma for her 73rd birthday. Unfortunately I write this review with a heavy heart. I am True believer in great customer service and that the customer service can make or break the experience. Unfortunately it broke the experience for this occasion. Our waiter never asked if it was our first time at Bardot so when we sat down and looked at the menu for the drink section we were lost. Our waiter did not inform us that there was no drink menu, so I had to flag another waiter down to ask and be informed by another about this. After ordering drinks, my mom had to wait 20mins just for coffee while everyone already had their drinks. Yikes. Our waiter rarely checked on us or asked if we needed anything else. Another yikes. Once we were ready to order our food, we had to wait til we found him to flag him down to get his attention. Now don't get me wrong, I understand that brunch is a very popular time to dine, hence Sunday funday, but if a restaurant is 4 stars, should this be happening? Now when it comes to the food, I would give it a solid B+. My mom and I both ordered the steak and eggs and we both wanted our steaks done medium rare, none of this cooked well done. Yuck. Well, one steak came out perfectly pink, the other not so much. As she cut deeper and deeper into her fillet, it got less and less pink. As she got to the end, it was cooked well done. I write this review with a heavy heart because like I said we had been looking forward to dining here, but if we paid $220 for a 4 person brunch at a 4 star restaurant, wouldn't you be a little heart broken too?",

I was so disappointed by the service. Complete opposite from the Sunday brunch crew at the bar. We walked in and sat at the bar where we always sit. The bar tender asked what drinks we wanted and we told him we were not there for drinks and ordered a burger. He caught the worse attitude and decided to card us (no problem) I had left my bigger heavier bag in the car and only took my smaller bag with me and I left my DL in the bag in the car. I told him I didn't have it with me and he told us we couldn't sit at the bar even though we weren't drinking and I've sat there all the other 4 times I've been there. We sat at a table where our waiter also had a crappy attitude took the order and we never saw or heard from him again even though there were only 2 other busy tables. It was the busboy who was kind enough to bring water, bread, butter, oil n vinegar more bread and asked how everything was. Needless to say when the check came I payed my bill and gave the busboy a tip instead of the waiter. Like I said the food is amazing here and I definitely plan to be back but I will make sure it's only on Sunday brunch. I don't mind paying $25 for a good burger but I don't remember asking for a side of attitude with it.",

The staff is attentive and our waiter even spoke with a french accent (it was good enough that I couldn't tell if it was real or fake!)  We started off with a couple of specialty cocktails - I can't for the life of me remember their names but I think one was called a Great Woman or something along those lines.  It was a pink egg white drink and on top of the egg one they had a B on it in pink...nice touch for sure!    We started with the escargot and seared foie gras.  Both were really rich dishes for sure!  The seared foie gras was perfectly cooked on a bed of rice and red cabbage.  As it was so rich I actually ate a little baguette with it to cut the flavor a bit.  The escargot wrapped in puff pastry was good but the garlic over powered it a bit.    For entrees we shared the french onion soup and parisian gnocchi.  We are suckers for amazing french onion soup and this one didn't disappoint.  They have add ons like an egg or short rib but I think it is delicious on its own.  The last dish we had was the Parisian Gnocchi...and wow was that amazing.  The morels, truffles and spring vegetables were perfect among the pillowly gnocchi. We were so full that we didn't finish either dish but they were both fantastic.    I'd definitely come back for another dinner...we were too full for dessert so I'll have to wait until next time.",

So Is BARDOT good? Yes it's fantastic. Why is it good? (Cuz maybe you don't like my idea of good)  Because it's French classics served to absolute perfection. Brilliant French baguette, butter from France, foie gras, duck l'orange, croque madame, escargot, fantastic French wine list and all of your familiar friends from the Champs Elysees.     If you're coming here I hope you like French food. If so, you're in luck. The demanding preparation of French staples is done to perfection. (Not easy, and if you're not a picky foody you might not notice that the temperature of every dish was perfectly hot, the skin on the chicken was exactingly crispy, the sear on the duck left the inside warm but tender, the baguette was fresh that day, that everything was seasoned impeccably and on and on.    Is it pricey? It ain't cheap. You're in a big Vegas hotel, no surprises here. You're getting what you pay for.   Service? Perfect. The GM made a point to greet us, the waitress was astute and attentive, able to answer any question and accommodate any food allergy. (I'm allergic to potatoes, True story)   It's a great place if this is what you're looking for. You could easily complain that there were no creative and surprising small plates or gold leaf on an iberico ham taco bite (Jaleo is in Cosmo). You could complain that there's no nachos or lots of fried comfort food and yes, you can eat cheaper at Guy Fierry's burger hole. You'll love this place if your a bit of a foody Francophile.  If you're looking for the $5 Fried Cupcake and Bacon Burger Sunday there's a buffet at the Stratosphere I think you'd enjoy more.",

We walked back and was quickly sat by the manager. The server Jesus was a pleasure. He was respectful and had a great personality.   I had an incident where I cut my arm and sleeve on the sharp edge of the table. I told the host just as a precaution so it didn't happen to anyone else. I wasn't upset except that my sleeve ripped. The manager came over and was very empathetic and took care of the situation. He introduced himself but I forgot his name but he was a big help. They bought me and my friend dessert and coffee.  Best part about this meal was the food. I had the blood orange duck wings. I totally would pay more if they were bottomless :) my friend enjoy his perfectly cooked steak: the French fries were even great. Great job kitchen!  Def would come back here another time.

    "text": "Bardot has been a favorite of mine for many years now.  Ever since my first experience in 2015, I kept returning every time I visited Las Vegas.  It's located in the Aria Casino, upstairs by the Buffet and it is great for both Brunch and Dinner.    My first experience was dinner and they have one of the best Beef Bourguignon I have ever had.  It is a bit salty, probably from all the reduction it goes through, but pair it with their bread which is served warm with soft creamy butter.  If you don't get the bread after you order, politely ask your waiter for warm bread and butter, trust me, you do not want to miss out on the bread and butter.   I tried their brunch the other day and I was so impressed and I just wish I could eat here everyday to try everything on their menu....one day. haha.    Dinner Recommendations:  - ESCARGOTS BARDOT - ONION SOUP GRATINEE - if you decide to get the soup....MUST MUST MUST add perigord truffle, braised oxtail & soft poached egg.  Best \"appetizer\" dish but more like an entree with all the additions.  I get so full off of this so best to share with someone.   - HERITAGE CHICKEN ROTI - Very tender chicken and flavorful.   - BLACK TRUFFLE FRENCH FRIES - Truffle and fries...do I need to say more?  - MACARONI & MIMOLETTE GRATINEE - More for the presentation, delicious but standard.  - Beef Bourguignon - The best on their menu IMO.  As for extra bread when you order this!   Dessert - CHOCOLATE MACARON - Their signature dessert, super chocolaty for those chocoholics and definitely will satisfy your chocolate cravings.  Large so will need to share.    Brunch - NUTELLA STICKY BUN - Delicious, warm and comes in a metal pot.  Wish there was more nutella on top.  - HUNTER'S WAFFLE - HOLY MOLY!  DELICIOUS!  Duck confit on top of a waffle topped with a poached egg and yummy sauce.  If you like duck, you will enjoy this dish.   - CROISSANT BENEDICTS with MAINE LOBSTER - Fresh lobster, delicious, and a perfect combo to share with your friend who ordered the Hunter's Waffle.   - TRUFFLE FRIES, GARLI AIOLI   Service: 5/5..  Great and attentive.  Knowledgable waiters with great recommendations.  Hostess sat us quickly.   Ambience: 5/5 - Clean and 1800-1900 Parisian style interior.    Parking: 3/5 - you have to pay for parking now at the Aria which sucks, but if you gamble and have the M Resort card, I think parking is complimentary.  Other than that, first hour is free, next hour is $7.  =(    Michael Mina, I am impressed and I cannot wait to try your other restaurants cause I know I will be getting a quality meal with great service.",

    "text": "My wife and hardly go to the Strip, especially for food but we always to find ourselves coming back to Bardot. Not only is the food exquisite but the service is exceptional. Kim S. And Eric H. are both very knowledgeable of the menu and friendly in the highest regard. We came dressed in full costume for Halloween (Ursula and Cruella) and they personalized our dinning experience regardless. Way to show a WOW experience!   Beef Wellington is amazing. Perfect red core and flaky outer shell. Make sure to order this right away because it takes 40 minutes to reach your table. The steak tartare is the main reason we go back. It is a healthy portion for an appetizer. Subtle flavor but the texture is where it is at. This is highly recommended.   'Twas a great Halloween date night!",

Passed the bar is the restaurant, very sober and simple. wood table and chairs, no white table cloth that would bring more class (in my opinion) i ordered some cocktail while we look at the menu. we decided for the \"assiette de charcuterie\" that we shared. i ordered a steak tartare served with some crunchy chips (i expected something more raffine my chips were very hard). i picked the small portion of the tartare, it could come as a main entree. then we ordered the salmon with lentilles and the ribeye cut. dessert we opted for the apple tarte tatin. dinner was ok. i was desappointed because i had higher expectations for some reason.  i prefer Bouchon at the venitian/palazzo or Mon Ami Gabi at Paris hotel where you truly experience a french brasserie spirit and class",

Detailed everything on the menu and made us want everything. We ended up starting with the bottomless sparkling rose, Foie gras parfait, and roasted beet and goat cheese salad. Both were awesome and lasted through the whole meal. The best butter in the world was good as well. Needless to say anything you order you won't be disappointed!  Make sure you get Oscar as your server! He is hands down great at what he does, totally on the ball, and turns your meal experience into an art. Cheers and bon appetite! You will not regret it. We are going to have to plan another trip to Vegas just for this brunch!",

    "text": "BARDOT Brasserie Review - From the moment we first stepped into Michael Mina's BARDOT Brasserie, a cute French bistro tucked into a corner next door to Jean George Steak House on the second-floor Promenade level of the Aria Hotel, we knew we were going to become regulars.  Was it the beautiful bar? Or the French accordionist serenading the guests? The crusty french bread? Actually, I think it was the \"Everlasting Champagne\" that accompanied an amazing menu.  Who doesn't find themselves three sheets to the wind in Vegas at noon at least once in their lives?  Decor The entire restaurant is fashioned in a classic but modern French bistro setting. Rustic treatments, artwork, and gold splash the walls tastefully and not overbearingly so. The bar itself is such a showpiece I had to include a picture of it to show the grandeur of the bar. The seating was surprisingly comfortable and after half a dozen visits over the past year, we haven't felt any seat/table was 'bad'.  Food After several visits to Bardot, and having had many of the menu items, we have yet to find a dish we didn't like, much less love.  Something as simple as a Smoked Salmon Plate is executed so well, that it sets a whole new standard. Here are some of our favorites, albeit not an all-inclusive list:  Foie Gras Parfait Recently I've discovered a newfound love of Foie Gras, and this parfait was a surprise to me. I usually love a grilled Foie Gras alone or atop a steak. Although Foie Gras parfaits are a classic preparation, I had never really tried, until Bardot. The flavor of the Foie Gras mellowed the sweetness of the port gelee so that spreading atop crusty grilled sliced bread felt so natural.  Smoked Salmon Bardot executes smoked salmon better- just better. Not only are the ingredients fresh and of high quality, but more importantly, the seasoning and flavors are so well balanced that it just tastes better. There's no other way that I can really describe it any better. The smoked salmon plate is loaded with smoked salmon, sliced brioche, chive mascarpone, cherry tomatoes, avocado, and traditional garnishes. Sipping champagne while noshing on these gems make the day so great!  Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad The beet and goat cheese salad has made me love beets again. After I first had this salad, I immediately added beets to my grocery list. I already love goat cheese, but the cana de cabra cheese in this salad was like goat brie or bucheron. The creaminess of the cheese and bite of the beets were all carefully balanced with the wild arugula, hazelnuts, and mild vinaigrette. I've also added hazelnuts to my grocery list to throw on my salads!  There are too many other great dishes that can be had at BARDOT that I haven't listed here. Go and try them - whether it be brunch or dinner, you won't go wrong here.  Service  An additional highlight of Bardot is their consistently high level and quality of service. We have been there on weekdays, weekends, brunch, dinner, holidays, and off days. Every visit has been met with just the right amount of attentiveness while maintaining excellent service.",

I work in the service industry & I truly have never experienced this level of being ignored while dining out. Once we got our food, our sever never checked up on us to see how everything was. We wanted more wine from the bottle we ordered but we never saw that again even though there was enough left for at least 2 1/2 more glasses when they took it away after pouring it for us. When we finally did see our server she quickly came to our table scooped up the glasses of wine & walked away. At that point we didn't want to stay any longer. So I paid for a bottle of wine I didn't finish, awesome. But I truly wish our server was as attentive to us as she was to literally everyone else around us. Ruined it for me, everything else was 5 stars excellent.",

It all started when I sipped the extremely fresh squeezed and sweet orange juice. I can't believe I've never tasted orange juice like this before. Then the bread and BUTTER came. I could write a 2 page review just on the butter alone.  What happened next only happens in dreams... The French toast arrived. I've only felt this type of happiness the day my daughter was born :).  The crunchy outside and buttery smooth inside was topped with the creamiest vanilla ice cream and drizzled with heaven sauce which was orgasmic. Two words--- mind blowing!  The double cut bacon almost made me cry it was so good. There isn't another restaurant in Las Vegas you should even consider for brunch. Hands down the best I've ever had.   I almost forgot to mention that the inside is absolutely gorgeous and makes you feel like you're in France",

So many delicious items on the menu, I couldn't decide what to order... guess I'll have to come back to try the things I missed!  So we ended up with- Apps- Seared Foie Lyonnais - rich beyond belief... foie was perfectly seared... the balance of the dish was perfectly complementary to the foie.  King Crab Crepe- so good... buerre blanc and sunny side egg combined with the crab was a flavor explosion.   Entrees- Lamb Rack Frites- perfectly cooked, well seasoned... the chickpea frites were interesting in a good way. Sole Meuniere- nice and delicate... decent, but the weakest dish of the night. Dessert- Baba au rhum- holy crap this was good... literally a mouthful of butter, cream and rum soaked up by a spongy cake.   Service and setting were spot on.  Food is delicious and decadent.

To finish we had the Chocolate Macaron which are the best and biggest I've ever had.

I had the escargot appetizer. Each piece was like a little pillow of savory flavor.  We had some other shared appetizers at the table but my memory is failing me what they were.   For my entree I chose the mussels. Delicious, if not a little gritty. A friend had the salmon with lentils and this was amazing. So much flavor from two items typically lacking in any kind of taste. Definitely a stand-out on the menu.   And oh my god the chocolate macaron. It's definitely for sharing. But do it. Seriously. Save room for it or just take it to go. Vegas creates lots of regrets, and not having this macaron for dessert will be high on that list",

Our waiter was extremely kind and charismatic, despite the rather long wait for items. Restaurant is beautiful, with perhaps one of the most beautiful bars on the strip. Everyone enjoyed their food tremendously. For those who enjoy bread and butter, definitely recommend the beurre dechire. SO tasty. The eggs Benedict, burger, croque madame and hunter's waffle were all extremely tasty. The real star of the show however was their french toast. My husband will usually never eat french toast, waffles or pancakes without extra syrup. The almond/orange syrup offered with the meal made him forget what table syrup was! Only regret we had was not having big enough stomachs to also order the Nutella sticky bun. Next time!!!",

Seems some bars around Vegas have a hard time making good whiskey drinks. They are perfect here.  Our Escargot was good, not the best I have had but still good. The Pork Chop I got was delicious and cooked to perfection. Even the salad my wife got was above and beyond.  I ended the meal with just a simple French press coffee which was much better than I expected.  I will come back!",

APPS Bone Marrow - Excellent! Marinated very well and just the perfect serving.  Escargot - Tasty little morsels served in a puff pastry. A good gateway for anyone trying escargot for the first time.  French Onion Soup - Very well done. The croutons have a unique flavor that changes up the traditional dish.  ENTREE  Filet Mignon - Ordered rare and it was cooked perfectly. The piece of meat was exceptional and tender.  Maine Lobster Thermidor - Delicious and creamy dish with hints of dill.    Seabass - Great quality fish that is lightly seasoned with oil and lemon. This is my go to when I don't wan something heavy and rich.   SIDES Green Beans - garnished with almonds. This is my favorite preparation of green beans. It's salty lemon goodness.",

    "text": "We've all seen the reviews saying service sucks, or is slow, or \"fill in your adjective here.\" Let me say to those morons this is not In n Out burger where you can order your foie gras 'animal style.'  This is a for real, down to earth, as God is my witness, 5 Star Restaurant.  We had dinner there on a Thursday night. The Executive Chef was cooking. How can you be sure the Executive Chef is there? Ask. Simple enough.  We told our server, John Paul, we were in no hurry, and he got it. The first thing he asked was would we like a cocktail THEN he gave us menus. Nice. He got it. No hurry.  If you, dear reader, are in more of a hurry, tell your server. These guys and gals are pros. They get it IF you tell them. Most people willing to drop a couple hundred on dinner would rather savior the moment. Better yet, if you're in a rush, go to the crappy buffet and complain about that.  The two of us took 3 hours and spent almost $300. We're not rich, but enjoy a good meal. Yes, that included several drinks and dessert with no comps.  Ask yourself how many times you've walked out of a mediocre restaurant after spending a hundred or more completely disappointed? THIS is worth it.  What we ate   Charcuterie Board. A huge app good for three or more. We pigged out with the two of us. In house salami, Pate' and an amazing rillette. It came with grilled French bread, cornichon pickles and a house made Dijon. Fabulous.  After that we moved onto a wonderful red wine suggested by our somalier. Again. We asked. I told her I didn't want to spend $50 on a glass of wine. She suggested this gem at 12 bucks a glass. A bargain to any wine drinker. (Sorry, I don't  recall what it was) After we ate that our server return for what we wanted to order next. Get it? Take your time. They're cool with that.  We had the frisee aux lardon. Bacon, lettuce, and a delicious vinegrette. Light, tasty, wonderful.  Main course was bouillabaisse for me and a French sea bass for me better half. The fennel on hers was out of this world. My soup was extraordinary worthy of any reward.  Our server talked us into trying the chocolate macaroon for dessert. Again, superb.  Ya, this is too wordy, and any editor would chop it up, but I'm hoping you got the point.  To summerize, just slow down, and enjoy an amazing meal.",

    "text": "This restaurant has been the highlight of our dining experiences in Vegas.   From the moment we set foot in the door, we were treated to candlelit lighting and a venture into classic Parisian style. The grandiose bar upon entry was simply stunning and I almost requested a perch just to admire it.   We were lead to a booth seat which allowed for a view of the kitchen, and granted we enjoyed a late-night (after 10pm) meal, we noticed every member of the staff carried themselves as if it was the dinner rush, with the same hustle and care you might expect.   Our server Kim, or LIl' Kim as she was labeled by her colleagues treated us with utmost respect, care and offered genuine suggestions to assist in our meal. Cocktails were super yummy and the pace at which the food arrived was seamless.   In fact, the second round of cocktails my partner ordered was not as good as the first and our server happily exchanged it without billing us for the switch.   We ordered the chickpea frites, the Chiteaux cheese, the Tarte Flambee and the Croque Madame. The first two options came on wooden and marble slabs, respectively and the portions were perfect for an amuse buche, In all honesty, I was feeling rather full after the appetizers. Our mains were scrumptious and clearly made to please. Savoury and well-orchestrated was the norm for the food we enjoyed here.   The ambience is lends itself to being both modern & romantic. From the presentation to the portion size to the flavour Bardot's food went over and above our expectations. Their Chef is a wizard and we were delighted with every bite.   If you are staying in Vegas and wish to blow your date away, take them here. Unpretentious service and reasonably-priced, decadent food - you simply cannot go wrong. Thank-you for a treat of an evening Bardot Brasserie -- we will most definitely be back!",

    "text": "We first found out about Bardot Brasserie through Jeannie and a former college dorm mate of mine.  Jeannie had been snatched up from Aria's Five50 to run the Brasserie.  We went the first time on the second day the Brasserie was open.  The interior truly looks like a period Parisian brasserie, from the wood used inside to the wait staff's uniforms.  We started with the oysters on the half shell (to be honest we try to always start with oysters on the half shell), and then split the crown rack of lamb.  We paired each course with a different glass of wine - the by the glass menu is extensive, and reasonably priced.  We came back a few months later, and our second visit confirmed Bardot as our absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  The wait staff was beautifully attentive without hovering.  The poured wine portions were generous.  The food was magnificent yet again.  Everything was timed to perfection. Right  as we completed our cocktails, the oysters were brought out to the table, and our empty glasses were replaced with a beautifully flinty chablis.  We had a nice amount of time to eat the oysters, and talk and engage our neighbors at the next table (their daughter was adorable).  Our main course arrived shortly after the oyster remains were whisked away, accompanied by another, different glass of wine.  Again, everything perfectly cooked and absolutely scrumptious.  Jeannie graced us with her presence, and I think we really gushed with how much we enjoyed her restaurant, and how impressively she runs her kitchen.  At the end of dinner, Jeannie sent out her signature dessert - an apple tart.  Oh. My. God.  It was completely fantastic.  We will continue to return on each visit to Vegas.  There really is no better place to eat on the strip.",

It would have been better if the baguette was warm.  Had the bloody mary which was a featured drink, nothing special about it.  We started with the escargots.  Honestly, was a bit disappointed as the order only had 4 escargots and previous pictures on Yelp showed 6.  They were tasty but very small.  For our main course we ordered, the croque madame, nutella sticky bun, and French toast.  The egg on the croque madame was perfect, runny and warm.  The French toast is huge.  It's definitely a dish that can be shared.  Really liked how they were able to keep the inside soft and custardy and the contrast of the almond brittle and vanilla mascarpone was perfect.  My favorite dish was the nutella sticky bun.  A little pricey for one sticky bun but well worth the calories and very memorable.  We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I went here on the recommendation of one of my coworkers.  Me and the man friend weren't celebrating anything just a date and a night out.  I really like french food and nicer restaurants, but he hasn't been to a lot of them. The atmosphere and the look of the restaurant is very cook, brassy and mirrors and glass everywhere its very cute and I really enjoyed it.  We made reservations for 7:30 and arrived a little early, they were able to seat us right away.  We were led by whom I believe to be the maitre d' or perhaps one of the managers, to a table for four people, even though we were only 2, that also had a card on the table.  Once I sat down I realized that the name on the card was not mine nor my man friends.   I asked the gentleman who had sat us if he needed this, to which he replied and stated to my man friend, \"you're not victor?\", my man friend stated no, and I made a joke about him seating us at the wrong table, (I work in the hospitality industry, and have worked in restaurants before, so I understand that things happen), the gentleman's response was a half laugh and to ask again if he was not Victor.  Still not Victor. The entire encounter was a bit strange but again I understand. The waiter then came over to take our drink orders, and bring us some menus as we had not been given them when sat.  I asked for a recommendation on a wine that was similar to a Merlot, and the man friend got an old fashioned. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and asked if we had any questions or anything. We got escargot for a starter which I love and the man friend isn't normally a fan of, but he really liked them as did I. They were cooked perfectly, seasoned very well, and the crescent crust they are surrounded in was amazing.  I have eaten at bouchon and they do something similar there, but this is amazing as well, very impressed for just having opened up.   I got the gnocchi for my main dish and he got the chicken, we got the macaroni to share for a side.   The waiter complimented our choices and stated that we would indeed enjoy them. He was a very great guy, shame that I never did get his name, he did not tell us, and wasn't wearing a name tag to my  knowledge.   The mean was amazing, every thing tasted amazing, the chicken was cooked perfectly, my gnocchi was amazing and the macaroni was to die for.  We then decided to have some desert which was amazing, we got the chocolate macaron, and I am a fan of macarons so that was already a plus.  Its an over sized chocolate macaron, with salted caramel and a chocolate ganoch over the top of it. Melted in my mouth, was so very rich and decadent.   I also got an after dinner drink that the waiter recommended and stated would taste sort of like a chocolate shake, he was indeed right. Delicious!   Our overall experience was amazing! I will certainly be coming back again and recommend it to my friends and those who come into the hotel I work for. They have a few bumps that need to be worked out, but I am confident that they will have a wonderful go of it in Las Vegas and a very successful restaurant and bar.",

French wines in particular the Sancerre white was crisp, fresh, fruity and had a clean finish. Was recently told they do weekend brunches and ask for Shannon to be your server, she is a gem and provided outstanding service.",

Secondly I ordereed the lobster Benedict. It was well prepared but not my favorite. I just think the lobster flavor overpowered everything in it. Still I would return to try more on the menu. I liked the service and ambiance and the food showed a lot of promise.",

    "text": "HANDS DOWN THE BEST FRENCH TOAST I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!  It is pillowy soft heaven on a plate.  Apparently, they soak the massively thick cut brioche in their custard mixture overnight to get it so moist and delicious!  It is so creamy yet light in texture and not too sweet.  You may not even need to spread that dollop of vanilla mascarpone but it is loaded with vanilla bean--yum!  It certainly adds more decadent richness to the dish.  The French toast is set off quite nicely with crunchy almond brittle.  It is also paired with an orgeat (almond) syrup, which just adds another flavor layer to the party...but honestly, the French toast on its own is superb!  This is definitely a must have if dining here for brunch.  I also added the double cut bacon (pork belly fans will love this) and poached eggs which were cooked perfectly.  It turned out to be a lot of food so next time I'll just have the French toast with the bacon!  Service and ambiance were great as well.  Can't wait to try Bardot for dinner next time we're in Vegas.",

French toast: super massive. Couldn't finish it. Highly addicting. Great texture. Crisp outside, soft middle. Mascarpone highly necessary and really does taste like vanilla bean. Seemed like the syrup had some almond undertones as well.  Croque madame: this wasn't the croque madame that resembled the one I ate in Paris, but still good. It involves a lot of bread and sauce. The salad came in whole leaves, so you have to cut it yourself or eat it like a rabbit would. The salad dressing was delicious.  Side of double cut bacon: I think it came in 4 pieces. You must eat it right away while it's still hot. Once it gets cold, it's harder to cut into. Very smoky and very salty. Good.  Side of hash browns: It's not your normal hashbrowns. They come in rectangles with an added nuance of herbs mixed into the potatoes. Super crispy outside. Soft in the inside. For some reason, this was only thing that I felt like we didn't have to order. It was okay. I eventually asked for ketchup to add some flavor to it.  Coffee was really good.",

Just walking into Aria is fun and finding Bardot is like a hidden treasure. Show up early and sip a cocktail at the awesome bar!   We got to sit at a booth and peek into the awesome kitchen. The server was adorable and she explained the menu and even answered my questions. We eat out often and are pretty adventurous and will try mostly anything.   Let's start with warm french bread that is toasty on the exterior and soft on the inside with house butter.... house butter?  oh man that butter could be eaten buy the spoonful! I had to control myself.   My highlights... We had the Steak tartare - it was sooo good and fresh.  Escargot - Beautifully presented wrapped in a fluffy pastry puff.  Duck wings... one word...delicious.   Roasted beet and goat cheese salad-  Whenever I see a beet salad on a menu, I have to order it, I love beet salad. This was perfectly dressed and the goat cheese was to die for.   Ribeye Steak - Worth every frickin' penny. I always get worried that a chef is going to ruin a good steak that I pay good money for... but in this case it was a wast of time to worry... juicy, perfect and soooo much flavor!! Making my mouth water as I type this. The mashed potatoes were my favorite. I love mashed potatoes and I didn't realize how bad mine suck until I tried these.   Mac & Cheese-My husband had the Mac and Cheese. Holy cow!! How do they do this? I really wanted to take a photo, but we made a deal to keep our phones off at dinner.  AND... It tased better than it looked and trust me it looks amazing!! I feel bad for the guy that has to prep that plate! Im sure you can find a photo of it somewhere. It probably has its own Instagram account. If not for any other reason... Go to Bardot and get your MAC& CHEESE on!!! FOR REAL  I was full... but hubby always wants dessert. The Chocolate Macaron was .... Oh so macaron! Melt in your mouth worth every calorie, paired well with the hot and strong coffee.   We have lots of amazing places to eat here in LV, and its always fun to try something new but I won't passing up the chance to  return to Bardot. The server was telling us about brunch. We have family coming to town for the holidays and we are definitely doing the brunch next!!! We cant wait!",

Food itself was great too. We ordered a pastry basket just to realize they actually also give out free fresh baked baguettes, but the croissants and danishes were so tasty we don't regret having double the amount of carbs than we intended.   For the starter I had a French onion soup, which was somehow both sweeter and saltier than I would have liked. Considering I also find most onion soups in Paris salty perhaps this is just the way it's supposed to be?  For the entree I ordered mussels and frites, which comes with a large bowl of mussels and fries with mayo (and some ketch up... guess you didn't stick to your guns to being European).  One thing to note that perhaps also speaks to their authenticity - the portions are also pretty small. My bowl of mussels was sizable, but the hunter's waffle my friend ordered was tiny (more like two 1/4 waffles with some toppings).",

    "text": "When in Vegas, we foie gras.   It's become a bit of a tradition for the boyfriend and I to seek out the buttery, savory delicacy when we're in town and last night was no exception. A Yelp search for foie gras turned up a newcomer since our last trip in Michael Mina's BARDOT. With overwhelmingly high marks we decided to reserve via Open Table.  An after-thought caused Brandon to follow up with a phone call to request a booth and mention that we were celebrating a special occasion (my birthday is in a week).  We arrived and were seated right away at a two-top table centrally located in the dining room, which was most certainly not the more private booth that we'd requested. If you like hearing every word from your neighboring diners this is the place for you! I mean, so loud at times that he had to lean over the table and ask me to repeat myself. If you're expecting a romantic bistro, this isn't it.  Wine drinkers, take heed. Their menu is exorbitantly priced. I generally drink Chardonnay, but their cheapest glass was $17. I opted to order the $38 half bottle of white Bordeaux, knowing I'd likely have two glasses over the course of our meal.  The seared foie gras appetizer over lentils and shallots was stunning. We both agreed that we could have polished off about five more, but at $29 we refrained. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious and a nice portion to share (between two!)  I'd wanted to try their French Onion soup, but ringing in at $17 (I believe), I just couldn't justify the addition.   For our entree, Brandon and I decided to share the Surf and Turf combo of 14oz ribeye and king crab. $88 + $29 for the crab. Expecting a True \"surf and turf\" I was surprised when our respective plates came out, ribeye divided with crab meat topping each half. A $117 entree and you cut our steak in half and top each one with about 4 ounces of crab meat? Where I come from that's called a steak served Oscar style. Even in Vegas I wouldn't expect that to cost more than $100 and...You. Cut. My. $88. Steak. *sad face*  All said, the steak was seasoned well and cooked as requested and the crab was delicious though scant. The accompanying French fries weren't anything very special, however the garlic aioli served alongside was fantastic and elevated the side.  Service seemed slow but Jesus was pleasant and kept my wine glass filled throughout the meal.  I just expected more for what we ended up paying. And not a mention of our special occassion was made. *sigh*   Bardot, I wanted you to romance me in a classic, swooning French kind-of way.  Instead I left feeling like a tourist who'd been pick pocketed while admiring the Eiffel Tower.   That foie, though...*drool*",

The food was delicious as well. I got the burger and the fries with garlic aioli, and I could have licked the plate afterward if we weren't in public. The manager, Matej, is also amazing and extremely attentive. If you're on the fence, do yourself a favor and come here. Food, ambiance, service are all top notch.  Thank you for making our brunch (and my husband's 30th birthday meal) so perfect.",

    "text": "I've heard good things about Michael Mina and really wanted to try one of his restaurants. We happened to stay near ARIA so BARDOT was close by. I convinced my friends to come for weekend brunch after a wedding rehearsal. We had made reservations but had to add some extra people last minute; the hostess was very accommodating and we got our table in 15min.  They started us with complimentary French bread and vveeerrry smooth butter which was yum.  Shortly after, our food came.  Then the meal turned...average.  I had ordered an appie and an entree - both came at the same time instead of one after the other, which was kind of odd.  So I ended up eating my Fois Gras with the ruby port gelee and country bread alongside my Hunter's Waffle which I was worried would be getting cold while I ate my appie.  Hm... As for the dishes itself, I don't know if I played it too safe with my dish selections as I didn't feel wowed by either dishes.  The Fois Gras was smooth and the ruby port gelee provided a nice jelly texture mixed in, but overall taste was just OK and not memorable.  I've had better, and probably won't get it again if I come back.  The portion was huge though as I needed help finishing this dish!  The Hunter's Waffle was like a duck confit benedict on waffle; it was nice, but I expected better.  Each component tasted good separately but the combination of the parts didn't elevate the dish.  I tried my friend's Beef Bourgignon Croissant Benedict and we both agreed, it was good but also like the Hunter's Waffle, the flavors failed to combine into a memorable dish.  For the price point, we expected more. Also expected more on the service side.  Maybe it was just because I didn't order a drink (?) as I had 1 glass of water the entire meal not refilled.  I hope my friends at the other end of the table who ordered the bottomless Rose had more luck getting refills.",

Food tasted burnt and quickly thrown together.  Staff seemed untrained.  Second time ordered the most expensive steak and requested medium rare which it ended up being well done and was a thin cut not as advertised.  Did get an upset stomach after eating there that night.  The quality of the service and the dishes do not measure up to a 5 star restaurant reputation.  Food needs work as it seems to be diner food quality for the high prices you pay.  However the cocktails were good.",

We also ordered chickpea fries and beet salad.  The funny thing was when we sat down our waiter greeted us with a \"French\" accent...my husband is English but also speaks French and turned to me and said that he doesn't really speak French...:)  We ordered a glass of wine and were really shocked at how small a pour it was..it was below the mid-line of glass and my husband mentioned it to the waiter when he went by him.  The waiter did come back to our table and filled up his wine glass, so we really appreciated the gesture..One thing to point out is that he LOST his French accent and became an American...

    "text": "Let me start off by saying the food, service, and decor at Bardot have always been excellent.  It has been a standard for other so-called fine French restaurants to admire.  Bringing friends and family to here was the highlight of any trip to Las Vegas.  This last visit however was a disappointment, in a different way.  My guests and were enjoying a meal, when the hostess seated large group behind us.  Suddenly a big hairy dog appeared next to me, and sprawled out on the aisle floor. It was an unpleasant surprise in such a nice place. It wasn't clear if the hostess had seated them with it, or they had snuck it in. It's hard to imagine anyone missed a giant golden retriever.  After quite a while, and several guest stepping over the thing, a hostess approached the owners.  She asked if it was a service dog, they said it was and belonged to their sister who was coming late.  This was clearly the usual diversionary tactic. The dog was a pet: it had no gear or collar indicating any kind of legitimate service to anyone. The \"sister\" never did materialize. Toward the end of the visit another hostess came by the group and said she really should have them leave but \"this dog is too so darn cute\", and proceeded with to pet it while juggling menus.  This was inexcusable behavior - none of the staff had the discipline to enforce the rules.  So, I called an end our meal.  On the way out, I spotting a table that had been hiding a small dog in a bag, and was taking it out for scraps from the table.  I pointed this out a hostess in passing, but they just smiled and thanked us for coming.  I can somewhat tolerate the recent lowering of standards for attire, but animals have no place in decent restaurants.  It's not cute in any way: just unappetizing and disgusting.  I'll be taking my guests and money elsewhere, until there is a policy change.",

What really made our experience exceptional was our waiter, Oscar, who has waited on us all 3 meals.  He was outstanding...very customer service oriented, attentive to details, and his knowledge of not only the food but also their wine and spirits was incredible.  Every meal has been an educational experience and I always leave looking forward to coming back for another.  If you have gone before or haven't been yet...

We went after being at the pool for a little while and went during brunch.  It was very busy and food was coming out fast. Unfortunately mine was wrong, I specifically asked for lobster Benedict and ended up with smoked salmon. I mentioned it to the bartender and they looked at the computer and said that I did order lobster.  After looking forward to it and not being a real fan of smoked salmon I was not thrilled with the meal. Then there was a problem with charging the bill to the room so this was well below the experience of my last few visits and hopefully not an indicator of what the future holds.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner Thursday night at 7pm and the restaurant was about 1/3 full.  It absolutely pains me to write this review and only give 3 stars because I feel like there's so much potential here!  The menu is enticing, service absolutely 5 stars, prices are very fair and ambiance is perfection.  The catch is....the food was mehhh 3 stars at best.  Considering this is a restaurant review, I have to base my stars on the quality of the food.  What we ordered:  1. Foie Gras Parfait- 4* delicious and creamy but it was more filler (i.e. cream) than foie gras.  still very yummy though 2. Beef Wellington for 2 people- 3* SO SALTY!! the filet was cooked beautifully and that along with the foie gras sauce would have been perfection together.  But the dry outer crust and the insanely salty duxelle made it unpalatable.  My hubby and I had to scrape the outer parts off and just eat the steak and sauce.  Plus it was $130 for the two portions and it didn't even come with a side.  That's expensive even by Vegas standards. 3. Black truffle french fries- 0* terrible.  The first batch we got was stale and not even warm so we sent it back.  The second batch we got was still stale and the truffle flavor wasn't even detectable.  You could see the black flecks of supposed truffle but there was absolutely no taste of truffle at all.  We didn't want to be a bother and send it back again so just left it untouched.  tragic  We skipped dessert because we didn't want to be disappointed further.  Our bill amount to $230 including a glass of wine.  Not bad- but not worth it.  There's potential here if they could get their kitchen to execute as well as their front of house staff.",

We also had the mille feuille for dessert which was very good.  Our favorite dish of the night was the king crab crepe. My wife really liked the taste of the buckwheat crepe which was pretty good by itself. The crepe was topped with king crab, trumpet mushrooms, a sunny-side egg and a waiter-poured beurre blanc sauce. The dish worked as a whole, was flavorful and was a great way to start the meal.  We ordered the rib eye steak frites since this was a brasserie, and it was mighty tasty. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, paired with a tasty garlic aoli. The fries were good by themselves and apparently cooked in beef fat, but they were also good with the garlic aoli. The rib eye was also pretty tasty, not as good as dry aged rib eye from a steak house like Mastro's, but still pretty good by itself. While the rib eye was great by itself, it was even better with the Bordelaise sauce.   The oak smoked Duroc pork chop tasted a bit like bacon, given that it was smoked and salty. While the taste was great, unfortunately, it was very dry. This was the most disappointing thing about the dinner. Otherwise, the pork chop was served with bacon, some root vegetables and slices of cornichon.   Our waiter recommended the mille feuille for dessert, and it was a great way to end the meal. Essentially, the mille feuille is made of layers of thin caramelized puff pastry sheets separated by vanilla pastry cream (creme patisserie). The difference in texture between the delicately crispy puff pastry sheets and the soft pastry cream really worked. The dessert was sweet but not overly so and was surprisingly good.  Overall, everything was flavorful and well-executed for the most part, with the exception of the pork chop. However, even with that slight misstep, we would come back if we were in the mood for French brasserie cuisine.",

I would definitely return for brunch!   Every meal is served with a fresh warm baguette and homemade butter which I could have eaten 3 loafs of.   Duck Wings A L'Orange: sweet, sticky, and savory. Not something I'd order again.   La Boulangerie: Croissant was a disappointment, but the other 3 breads were very yummy!   Hunter's Waffle: Lot's of savory duck, perfect poached egg, rich maltaise sauce. The waffle could have been a lot crispier, and I think had it been I would have been in love with this dish had the waffle not been soggy.  Mussels & Frites: These were the largest mussels I have ever seen or eaten, and every single one was huge. The french fries were typical and served with ketchup and a truffle aioli.   Creme Brulee: Everything you could expect and want from a creme brulee, perfectly and traditionally prepared.",

Perfectly seared, buttery and delicious. We also tried the duck wings a l'orange which were ok, but didn't cause much of an impression on me. The salmon entree was served also with beluga lentils. Nice and crispy on the outside, however mine was slightly overcooked. Nonetheless the flavors were on point. The wine list, including by the glass, was as expected excellent with lots of French options. Dessert was the baba au rhum which was not a traditional cake, it was more like a loaf of bread, with lots of rum and light chantilly cream.",

The flavor combinations that the chef prepares are divine and the upscale high quality service and cuisine do not disappoint. Although this is a very high end restaurant, we arrived in jeans and sneakers and did not feel u comfortable at all! Staff was wonderful and attentive. The food was outrageous. We started with the specialty crepe: Lobster and egg with pear and sweet butter. Need I say more? Main course of lamb and polenta with polenta fries that were so crispy and moist they almost stole the show! For dessert, it was nothing less than fine French baked pastries and cream puffs. We will for sure return the next time we are in Vegas! One of the best dining experiences we've had.",

I had the house smoked pork chop, which was almost inedible when you combine the smokiness with the saltiness, and finish with a mustard sauce.

Bardot is the rare combination where the food was flavorful (and filling!) and the service was top notch.  I ordered the Warm Beet Salad to share with a friend and a French Toast all for myself. Let me say that the French Toast can EASILY be split two ways. It's massive! The fluffy toast was served with crunchy almond brittle, vanilla mascarpone, and orgeat (almond-y) syrup. It's a well thought out dish and the perfect combination of dense, moist, and caramelization.  The beet salad was pretty good. The vinaigrette was subtle and didn't take flavor away from the beets, goat cheese, or arugula. For an $18 salad, attention to detail was expected and accordingly presented.  The coffee was pleasant and the servers made sure my cup was never empty. I was impressed with their speed despite a busy Sunday brunch crowd.   To add icing on the already pleasant experience, Bardot presented each diner with a complimentary cinnamon roll in celebration of their 1 year birthday.   Overall, the ambiance, the service, the huge French Toast portion, and the free cinnamon roll blew me away. LOVED!",

It was a great experience while we were there, but I won't return because of the over-salting issue.  Steaks delicious, though one of my dining partners ordered medium-well and got medium to medium rare.  Can't understand how that type of establishment can goof up on the cook.

We dined here on a Sunday night so the restaurant was about half empty, but from the moment we stepped up to the hostess stand the service was nothing but exceptional. My wife and I both ordered cocktails, my wife had the moulin rouge and I had the Le peche mode. Both were fragrant and quite tasty. The food was generally good but I felt that some of the dishes were lacking that certain je ne sais quoi for me to give this restaurant 5 stars. For starters we decided on the escargot, king crab crepe and the bone marrow. The bone marrow was rich and smoky, and the escargot was good, but not memorable. However, the king crab crepe was exceptional. The crepe was delicate and light and the filling was seasoned to perfection. For our entree we shared the loup de mer which was quite delicious as well. Overall an enjoyable dining experience!",

We came in with a group of 16 girls for brunch on a Saturday morning. They had split us into two separate tables- which was fine we didn't complain about that and sat down right away happy to be there. It was all downhill from there. We started off by ordering the bottomless rose. Our waiter walked off and came by later to take our food order, and we nicely asked him if our rose was on the way he told us to relax. Quite a rude comment to say to a paying customer, especially when we are asking a question about our meal. He proceeded to make rude comments throughout the meal. He told us to relax upwards of 10 times, commented on someone \"drinking too fast\", told someone else to \"relax with the wine\". He made condescending comments each time he came to the table. He wouldn't let us edit our order for a salad to not have beets in it (which seems very strange considering people have allergies). Every time we asked for something he told us to relax. When we asked for ketchup he told us to relax. Perhaps his worst comment of the meal was telling my friend she wasn't eating enough food, I don't think it's his place to comment on someone's eating habits. The service got so bad I had to speak with a manager half way through the meal, and while he listened to my concerns, he didn't do anything about it. He didn't have the waiter apologize, and he didn't even give us the option to leave our own tips. Our bill arrived and the tip was already included, which he most definitely didn't deserve that amount after we complained about our poor service. Unless you want to be judged and spoken down to for your entire meal I do NOT recommend eating here.",

    "text": "This place was just ok. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could but yelp doesn't do that. The menu isn't huge but does offer a pretty decent amount of options. One of my biggest complaints is the prices for what you are getting. I mean I work in fine dining and totally understand having to charge top price for quality ingredients but this place seemed to have just randomly started assigning outrageous prices all over the menu. Not to mention I felt guilt tripped by the server for not wanting to order a bottle of wine, like I'm sorry I wasn't looking for wine tonight I'm just as pleased with my beer and my bfs cocktail stop asking me if I'm sure. And the sommelier was rude, if u are going to ask how a meal was at least pretend to even listen to the response before walking away. Now onto the food cuz as I said I work in the industry and respect quality food at a high price, but even there the food was lacking. We had the oysters, good standard oysters nothing too special. Then we had the escargot which I wanted to love, but honestly wrapping them in the pastry totally took away everything and that's all you could taste, very disappointed. I had the NY Strip which was fine, once again nothing special or stand out about it and mine seemed a little too fatty, a good 1/4 of my steak was all fat which I know creates flavor but when you are getting a 12 Oz steak and at least 3oz of it is straight fat it's disappointing. My bf had the lobster which was good except the fact the bernaisse sauce overwhelmed the dish so much he couldn't even enjoy it. Plus is side of polenta with mushrooms and peas was so under seasoned we each took 1 bite and pushed it to the side to never be touched again. Overall a disappointing experience, neither of us wish to return again and defn will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future. With so many great restaurants in Las Vegas this one defn should be skipped.",

I don't remember the cost, but there was a good selection of options for the three courses, but I'd had my heart set on the escargot.  Escargot is one of those things - if it's on the menu, I will get it, and I will choose the rest of my menu around it, so since that was not one of the appetizer options I went a la carte.  Unfortunately, the escargot was not what I expected. I knew it came wrapped in a pastry puff, and I like anything in a pastry puff, but this just didn't do it for me.  Not bad, just not great.  A bit on the dry and chewy side.  The mussels that I had for dinner made up for it.  A huge bowl of plump mussels in a delicious creamy broth that I just soaked up with the warm baguette that came with it.  I wish I had room for dessert but I was stuffed at that point.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, checking-in regularly to see if we were ok, or if we needed anything else.",

We asked to move and were accommodated which we appreciated. I agree with other postings that it is very expensive for the quality. I do not mind paying if the food and ambience are superior but this restaurant falls short. First, the price for a glass of wine was ridiculous - $20 a glass. Our server didn't even pour our wine until after our appetizer was served. My husband ordered the oysters and said he felt sorry eating the baby oysters. We had to ask where they were from because they were so small ($21 for 6 babies). I ordered the burrata salad with peaches - 4 very small slices of peaches, a small tasteless piece of burrata with some julienned vegetables that were non descriptive ($21). My entre was the lobster bisque which was very good but my husband's steak ($67) was very salty and inconsistent (some parts good, some not edible). Yes, Las Vegas is expensive but spend your money somewhere else.",

The staff was very, very busy, but was still very attentive to guests at their tables and the bar.   I started with the French Onion Soup. It was some of the best I have ever had! It was in a large crock with lots of melted cheese on top. They serve warm baguette in paper bags with soft butter. Yummy! My husband started with the late and he said it too was very good.   The entrees were let downs for both of us. I had the sea bass. It was slightly over cooked and left it dry. He ordered the lamb frites and was disappointed when the plate only had 4 thick fries. When he asked how long it would take to order a side of fries he was told 15-20 minutes. He passed. He did say that the lamb was prepared well. When the manager saw the bartender remove my plate he immediately came over and asked why I didn't finish it. His concern was greatly appreciated. Although it wasn't necessary he did send us desert on him.   Overall I give them a little slack since it was Valentine's Day and they were completely booked. The staff clearly was busting their butts to make it a memorable evening for everyone. Thank you! Bee would try them again.",

We love the bar design, the vibe and the bustling dining room. My only complaint would be the photographer. We noticed her for the first time when we were dining there for my husband's birthday in September. It has always seemed tacky to me that fine dining restaurants in Vegas send around a photographer charging for pictures. We've always declined being photographed at other places, but since it was a special occasion, we agreed to let her take our photos. When she came back later and told us the price was $25 per picture for both print and digital, we said, \"no thanks.\" She got really snotty about it and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't like my pictures.\" We didn't appreciate her attitude, and I think it's ridiculous that a restaurant would charge that much money and have that customer photo strategy in 2015. We were a table of eight adults in our 30s and 40s. Why would we want 8 x 10 photo prints to carry around when we keep all of our photos on Facebook? They could've charged us $10 per couple for digital and made 80 bucks. Instead, they got nothing and turned us off.",

    "text": "Since I heard Michael Mina set off to refresh American Fish with a new brasserie concept, I was thrilled - it could've been a welcome addition to the scene with the likes of Bouchon Bistro and db Brasserie. So we decided we would go there for brunch.  The execution however, was less than ideal I must say.  - Onion Soup Gratinee with Perigord truffle, braised oxtail, soft poached egg -$25 - King Crab Crepe - buckwheat crepe, wild mushrooms, normandy beurre blanc $16 - Mussels Marinieres - garlic butter, dolin vermouth, warm baguette $26  A small baguette and salted butter were served first, and the baguette was cold - not fresh out of the oven, not even warmed up. A simple way to tell if a restaurant cares about details, if at all serving a hot bread counts as details.  The Onion Soup Gratinee was good, but to enjoy the deluxe version with those ingredients like truffle, oxtail and poached egg, we had to pay double.  King Crab Crepe was also an interesting concept. As it's aptly categorized as Hors-d'uvre, it was pretty small. The wild mushrooms were a bit too salty, but it's well done overall.  The flavor of Mussels Marinieres was good, but the mussels were undercooked - almost raw. Not only that, it was cooked unevenly - one part of the shellfish was cold and another was warm. It struck me as a failure.  And they didn't bring me a bowl for empty shells. Well... how was I supposed to eat them without it?? I was so curious that I decided to see when they would realize if I put those empty shells to a bread plate and... as I almost expected, it was when I finished the plate 99% and the bread plate was about to unleash an avalanche with the mountain of empty shells.  The food was a OK, service was less than average, and payout $85 including tax and tip. Will return? I don't think so - we have better options.",

    "text": "Came here with my girlfriend for her birthday bc we wanted to try at least one gourmet restaurant and I love French food.   Great decor, very brasserie/French feeling. It was bougie and anything but pretentious, the people at the table next to us were in fanny packs (blast from the past much?)  We started by splitting a French onion soup (my first not counting what they serve at Panera) and it was deliciously indulgent. The melted Gruyere was to die for, and overall very flavorful.   My girlfriend ordered the cod/bass (I forget which one but I'm too lazy to look it up) and I tried hers, it was quite excellent. Me, I'm a fan of a perfectly cooked roast chicken and I was served just that here. My only gripe was that the Au jus/drippings served on the side, the server poured it all over my chicken rather than letting me do it myself. Hence my bird was on the saltier end, more than I would like, but it was not unpleasant in the slightest.   The biggest surprise was the mushroom bread pudding which came with my chicken. I didn't think two things such as mushrooms and bread pudding could be combined so deliciously but they were. My girlfriend hates Mushrooms but even she was floored by how good it tasted.   The portions are gigantic btw so just be warned. I didn't think I could ever feel defeated by a meal but my gut was stuffed beyond doubt when I hit the 3/4th mark. My girlfriend threw in the towel much earlier so as such, neither of us could enjoy the dessert menu. However in our food coma states, we were not so secretly staring down the Mille feuille that the fanny pack folks were digging into next to us bc it looked delicious.",

We both had the salmon and it was superb. I don't know how they got the skin perfectly grilled but it was.  I started with the goat cheese beet salad and it also was very good with the baked goat cheese being outstanding.   I used to eat in the same space when it was American Fish which was very beautiful and served great food.  It is amazing how in Las Vegas a place as nice as American Fish can be replaced with another outstanding restaurant.",

    "text": "Had a very good, but not great, dinner at Bardot on a Friday evening.  Bardot has a large dining room, and when it is full (as it was when we dined there) it can be quite noisy.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it creates a good atmosphere.  But, if you are celebrating an anniversary or looking for a place to propose, I probably would look someplace else.  It'd be tough to get a romantic evening with this atmosphere.  We were seated in a large, and very comfortable, booth for our evening.  It made passing items a little tougher, but I liked it overall.  We were approached very quickly by our server and I immediately asked for the sommelier.  I really liked this guy, we told him what we were looking for, price range, and when we wanted them.  He took care of the rest, bringing wine out as we either finished a bottle or finished a course.  It was great, he only brought us fantastic stuff, and it prevented us from having to get the list out every time we needed something new.  Since none of us are knowledgeable about French wines, it was nice to tell him what we liked and have him handle it.  And, he didn't try to upsell us, he stayed within our stated budget.  As this group typically does, we shared a lot of dishes.  To start, we had the:  escargots, the royale shellfish platter, the foie gras parfait, the charcuterie board, and the hearth-fired marrow.  All were fantastic, but my favorites were the charcuterie board and marrow.  The marrow was buttery and rich, just like it should be.  It was fantastic on the toast points provided.  Were I to eat here again, I'd order two of this appetizer.  The charcuterie board had so much stuff on it we had to ask for more toast.  The pate and foie gras were excellent, which is no surprise.  The chilled shellfish was also great, save the oysters.  They were on the small side and weren't very flavorful.  The table agreed that these were the weakest part of all of the appetizers, and they are the reason Bardot doesn't get 5 stars from me.  I expected much better oysters from this place.  The escargots were served in puff pastry, which I'd not had before.  But, they had the traditional buttery rich flavor and were still winners.  For dinner, we shared:  Parisian gnocchi, croque madame, and the lamb crown roast.  The gnocchi was PHENOMENAL, probably the best gnocchi I've eaten.  It was served with wild mushrooms, goat cheese, and roasted garlic (never a bad addition to any dish).  My second favorite was probably the madame.  It was cheesy, hammy, decadence.  It's what grilled ham and cheese sandwiches want to be when they grow up.  My \"least\" favorite was the lamb.  And, it was still fantastic.  Juicy, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and served with a very tasty gravy on the side.  It came with a few frites, which were perfectly fried and seasoned well.  We selected some very solid entrees.    Service was very good throughout the evening.  The place was crowded, but we never felt like we were waiting for anything.  I'd absolutely eat here again.",

    "text": "Simple and Sweet  This place is an extremely romantic place to have dinner! As for my case i went here with friends and it was really amazing. The seafood tower (appetizer) we ordered was amazing. The waitresses explained each seafood's origin and my goodness were they fresh!  The crab, shrimp, lobster, and oysters were just spot on! I personally also got the french onion soup and for me it was a tad salty but the taste was really good. The caramelized onions just melted in my mouth and with the sharp swiss cheese its a perfect bite.   The main entree that i ordered was the steak and frites. Their steak options are limited which i like because id rather that restaurants be amazing at a few things than mediocre at many. The steak was grilled perfectly and seasoned nicely. The sauce that i chose to pair my steak with was a bearnaise sauce which was quite nice.   The dessert that i got was the apple tarte tartin which was a good way to finish up a heavy meal *.* I also got a coffee to go with the apple tarte which made it even more divine. Their coffee is amazing so make sure to pair with any of their desserts because they are a bit sweet.   The price I would say is pretty fair considering the ambiance, quantity, quality, and location. Lucky for me i did not have to pay but had i had to my bill would have been about $100. Nevertheless i would come back! It was really tasty and quality is quite amazing. Also thanks to the amazing staff here for being so friendly and helpful to us!   Cheers!",

The decor an ambiance was very nice, but I can't say the same for our dishes. I ordered the Moules Frites which wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't anything special. I also ordered the Second Coalition from the cocktail menu which is made up of bulldog gin, strawberry-lime cordial and sparkling wine. The drink was very sweet and honestly just tasted like strawberry syrup with sparkling wine. It definitely was not worth the price.   I would have to say the worst part of the experience was the service. The waiter never checked on us to make sure everyone was happy with their meal, cocktail or to refresh any drinks or water. He offered to get me a different drink at the very end of the meal when I was asking for my check (insert eye roll). Needless to say, I don't think I will be returning here anytime soon.",

    "text": "What was once a beautiful, rustic space with American Fish has been transformed into a lavish and elegant interior every bit equal to the $5 million they spent to renovate. They made this new Michael Mina spot more inviting and approachable by moving the bar to the front of the restaurant and added a small patio area. The impressive kitchen remains unchanged. Large windows encasing it allows diners a great view into the heart of the restaurant.  Many of the appetizers we sampled were stellar, particularly the pate de campagne ($13), foie gras parfait ($15), and blue crab crepe ($16). The port gelee topping the parfait was just sweet enough to balance the savoriness of the creamy foie. Less successful dishes included the escargots Bardot ($17), which I found to be too salty and garlic-heavy, and the tarte flambee ($14).  If you dine there for brunch, the Hunter's waffle ($19) and croque madame ($18) are both solid dishes, but French toast ($12) is a must. Despite it's impressive size, the thick cut brioche was surprisingly light and airy, even with the interior retaining much of the custard it was soaked in.  Of the savory dishes we tried the Heritage chicken roti ($29) was a standout with it's crispy skin and well seasoned meat. The Parisian gnocchi ($23) was beautifully presented with it's mix of pillowy soft pasta, mushrooms, and goat cheese.  Despite splitting the dishes with four other people most of us were stuffed. That didn't stop us from getting dessert. The mille feuille ($12) and apple tarte tatin ($12) were both excellent, but the chocolate macaron ($12) was my favorite. The crispy macaron shell, smooth chocolate cream in the center, sprinkling of salt and warm chocolate sauce poured table-side make it a chocoholic's dream come True.  Michael Mina restaurants can be hit or miss, but he's got a winner with this one. His team has taken a rather ho-hum brasserie concept and given it new life. With a mix of traditional and new dishes, it has the potential to attract many to French cuisine for the first time or a return visit.",

Las Vegas has so many good restaurants to eat at, on and off the strip there are celebrity chefs and delicious options, so service is really important to me and is what sets a restaurant and culinary experience apart in my opinion.   Upon walking up, the hostesses greeted us kindly and took us in without a reservation. Sadly enough, its rare to find friendly hostesses on the strip, but not here! Very personable.  Andrea was my server and the experience was flawless from start to finish.   We ordered the:  French Onion Soup (and I added the truffle, short rib, poached egg)- a must! This is all I planned on getting but it was so good I had to try more.   Heritage Chicken- This was the star of the meal. So juicy, I'm not typically a fan of meat on the bone but this was so tender it literally fell off. Even came with a side of green beans and mushroom bread pudding!  Pork Chop- Yummmmy. If you like pork chops, you will love this one.  Mac & Cheese- This macaroni and cheese had an awesome presentation, the noodles are individually standing up, very impressive. I wanted to take a picture but it looked so good I had to dig in!!   For Dessert, I had the infamous chocolate macaroon they advertise and it was very, very rich. If you're a chocolate lover, this will be your go to. I wanted to finish it so bad but I was so full I  almost rolled out of this place.  The restaurant is loud like previous reviews said, but I was still able to have conversation without a problem. I loved how I felt like I was in Paris. The service was very attentive but not overbearing. The hostess and manager even asked how we enjoyed our meal on the way out!  Bardot- I will be back!",

    "text": "********************* 1249 **********************      BARDOT Brasserie, Las Vegas' debut French concept from James Beard award-winning chef Michael Mina, is now open for dinner and weekend brunch at ARIA Resort & Casino. Paying homage to the skillful culinary techniques, celebrated libations and sexy atmosphere for which The City of Light is renowned, Chef Mina has created a stylish and unforgettable interpretation of a Parisian brasserie in the center of The Strip.      Created by Bishop Pass Interior Architectural Design Studio, BARDOT's space exudes a dark and sexy, almost enigmatic atmosphere. I couldn't believe this was former American Fish's space, it's lavishly beautiful, chic, and elegant at the same time.       BARDOT's main dining room offers a traditional yet luxurious dining space. Walls of black lacquer are paneled with gold pen striping, surrounding a series of Parisian columns. Burgundy leather booths and bistro-style tables spread across a pristine marble floor, where guests can sneak a peek inside the restaurant's show kitchen as they watch their meals come to life.      Sidewalk Cafe - A nod to Parisian sidewalk cafes, BARDOT features intimate seating outside of the restaurant for an entertaining dining and people-watching experience. Situated in the courtyard overlooking ARIA's second-floor promenade, the locale's French-inspired storefront and high windows transport guests to a 20th century literary cafe in Paris.      Innovative Cocktails by none other than Mina Group's Director of Cocktails Carlo Splendorini and ARIA's Mixologist Craig Schoettler salute French drinking tradition with an inventive beverage menu. The restaurant's cocktail program combines the best of French culture and Las Vegas style. Signature sips include And God Created Women, a satisfying layering of French spirits and egg whites; and the Voltaire, a cider-based cocktail that dazzles the senses with baked apple bitters and housemade ginger syrup.

They seated us 10 minutes after opening and seemed they were running a little behind. But then we asked for almond milk with coffee; they didn't have it but looked across the hotel to try to find some. Really above and beyond.  Would highly recommend this Bardot for a wonderful brunch.",

    "text": "I am very selective about my 5-Star ratings and am exceptionally happy to add one more to this short list.  I went to Bardot while staying at the Aria hotel/resort.  I honestly didn't think much of the typical fancy places in Vegas, which is maybe why Bardot was such a revelation.  Most of the fancy places are all decor and no real substance.  Bardot was the rare exception.  If I go back to Vegas, I'll be sure to dine there every night.  Bardot has your typical French decor: Beautiful tiled floor, lots of brass at the bar, and elegant seating.    Along with that decor comes a great bar and great bartenders.  These folks are genuinely happy to see you.  The customer service here is second to none.  Bartenders are experienced and knowledgable on all beers and spirits.  I tried a few beers before deciding that Hors D'age was going to be the one.  I highly recommend it, especially considering that you can only get it at Mina restaurants (or so I was told).  The food?  Delicious!  If you go for brunch, challenge yourself to finish the french toast.  It's like nothing you've ever had before.  Close to half a loaf, this delicious piece of heaven comes with a fantastic almond syrup thing that enhances the experience.  You've read enough of my rattling, go and try it.  You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Michael Mina does not disappoint--food had great flavor, presentation was great, and decor & ambiance were on point. Went for lunch on Sunday and was immediately impressed  by the interior of the restaurant when I walked in (esp the gold alcohol rack above the bar). However, service was not on the same level. The restaurant wasn't very busy, but our waitress was slow and not very personable (i.e. menus weren't given to us until 5 mins after we sat down, sister ordered an Arnold Palmer which wasn't brought to the table for 15 mins, seemed irritated that we asked if she could move closer to my sister who was ordering for the table).  MUST HAVES - French toast: a thick brick of brioche--super moist and custardy; the mascarpone and syrup was an delicious combination that added just the right amount of sweetness to the dish  - crab crepe: packed some really good flavor; the combination of the egg, crab meat, mushrooms and the apples = perfection - salmon benedict: perfectly poached eggs, smoked salmon was not too salty, and the bernaise sauce was the perfect consistency  OKAY TO HAVE  - Onion soup: just your average French onion soup--price tag is pretty steep for what it is but the portion is fairly large - escargot borgot: an interesting twist on escargot--inside a puff pastry shell w/ butter and hazelnuts. I did like it but it was cold by the time it came out to our table, which bummed me out - hunter's waffle: waffle and egg was perfectly done and the meat was tender.   DONT NEED TO HAVE - croque madame: nothing special--just ur average prep of a croque madame (bread, ham, cheese, egg). This was the greasiest and heaviest out of everything we got. If u want a croque Madame that'll blow ur mind, try the one at hatfields in LA. ;)",

Although service was professional, there was no sense of warmth in the service provided ... orders were taken, delivered and the occasional courtesy check was intermittently made.  No complaint at all from me ... again service was very professional. The food was nicely presented and very well seasoned.  Absolutely no need for the salt and pepper shakers at the table. All ingredients used were very fresh and cooked to perfection.  I highly recommend Bardot Brasserie to any culinarian who would like to experience a great meal.",

A huge huge Frisse salad with just enough tang in the dressing, lots of flavor, perfect egg.   Enough to share and the Sea Bass was a large and beautifully prepared piece of fish that was fresh, flavorful...yummy.   I'm definitely a fan!!",

If you like a little new twist on French food, you're definitely going to like this place!! ..  I'm not going to get into details of what we ordered but I can definitely say this the food was good and from what I saw on the rest of the tables around us there was no leftovers on the plates, so that should tell you something. When I stated that management step up to the plate, the reason for that was because they didn't have some of the items ( seasonal ) we want to order. Management felt they needed to make it up to us, which they really didn't have to because I can understand that from time to time somethings are seasonal so they brought some killer ass dessert for us, which we really appreciate it! So I would highly recommend this place when you come to Vegas.",

    "text": "We came to Las Vegas to visit our son and his partner. Our plans on where to eat a Thanksgiving dinner had been overlooked.   We went on the internet and Bardot in the Aria by Michael Mina was recommended. We called and got a reservation for 3PM which was perfect for us and happened to be opening time for the restaurant.  I was a bit skeptical before we arrived because I wanted something more classic Thanksgiving dinner than a chef's wild creation.  We got just enough of both to make it perfect. The food was simply delicious.  Every bite was superb.  It was a fixed price menu and I had no issues with any of the choices.  My wife started with the Lobster salad and I had the chestnut soup. We both liked our selections. The turkey dinner was absolutely delicious.  For dessert I had the apple tart with vanilla ice cream which was super and the perfect ending to this wonderful dinner.  The service was equivalent to the amazing food.  Our waiter, Oscar, was there when needed but not pushy. He made our meal all the more enjoyable.  The wine steward suggested a Pomerol within my budget which turned out to be excellent.  We decided to have another bottle of wine and Oscar suggested one from the haut medoc area which was also good.   If you are in Las Vegas, I would strongly recommend Bardot to anyone wanting to enjoy a fine meal and excellent service at reasonable prices. We will be back!",

Look for the Zarkana Theater and Buffet to help you locate it. Super cute bistro with brown walls and tons of windows. They have a bar area that displays various liquor bottles and next two that a table that shows some of their various baked pastries.   We started with that pastry basket. It had 4 kinds of bread I loved the two sweeter ones. I can't remember the names for the life of me haha   The steak tartare was the bomb. I could order one on my own. Probably one of my favorite dishes of the meal with taste and presentation. We also had the King Crab Crepe. If you like crab and mushrooms then this is up your alley. Also very yummy.  For the entree we had steak frites and salmon Benedict.... Talk about already full when these came. I had the hardest time deciding which main entree to get and these two were good. I think I would talk more about it if the starters didn't already blow me away.   Aaaanddd of course we had to have dessert. The chocolate macaron was so good but we could not finish it haha. Definitely good for at least 3-4 unless you want diabetes for one.   So yes to this place for that nice brunch. You will not be disappointed.",

We sat at our table and began perusing the menu. We had our eyes set on the tuna tartine appetizer when the waiter remembered to tell us about the tasting menu. Thank goodness she did because once we saw it we could not pass it up.   We got the summer melon and tuna tartine to start. That was followed by gnocchi for the second course. For the third course we got the lamb and sole, followed by each of the two desserts. I have to say I'm usually apprehensive about cherry desserts, but I loved the bing cherry clafouti. We wine paired the menu and were not disappointed.   This was a very classy restaurant and the food was phenomenal!",

The steaks come with fries but you can substitute them.  I would recommend you substitute the fries for the Brussels sprouts.  They are cooked to perfection and taste so yummy.  Even if you don't like Brussels sprouts you should try them, you'll change your mind about them.  Bardot is a must when staying at the Aria!",

    "text": "Our first fine dining experience in Vegas!  Bardot came highly recommended, so we made reservations for Monday dinner. It was our anniversary so we were surprised with a signed card at check-in from Bardot staff wishing us a happy anniversary. (No other out-of-the-way gestures pertaining to our celebration though.)  Once settled, BF started off with a smokey old fashioned. He had the seat facing the bar so he was able to see the bartender making his drink. He was impressed with the way the bartender mixed his drink and with the execution of said drink. It was his favorite iteration of all the old fashioneds he has had so far. Bread service was a fresh, hot baguette with salted butter. It blew all other baguettes we've had before out of the water. Right as we finished the bread, our steak tartare starter arrived. Mix the egg yolk in with the steak tartare and use the spoon to scoop the tartare onto the chips -- the chips are too fragile to directly use as a scoop for the tartare. The slightly salty chips balance the taste of the tartare. If you still have some baguette left over, the steak tartare tastes great with it too!  We had watched the Lego Batman movie a while ago and the lobster thermidor left an impression with us. Why does Lego Batman love it so much? What is it? When we saw it on the menu, we just had to order it. Since it was a bit of a gamble, we played it safe by picking a steak for the second entree. So it turns out the lobster thermidor is super creamy -- so much that halfway through, I had to clear off the excess sauce from the lobster pieces in order to eat it. The thermidor came with an excellent side -- mashed potatoes with peas, mushrooms, etc. The flat iron steak, however, was the star of the meal. I'm trying to remember when I had that good a steak and nothing comparable come to mind. It was lean, tender, and flavorful. The meal up to this point was going to be a 3 stars kind of meal, but the flat iron knocked it up to 4 stars. The meat was delicious, but the side (beef fat fries) could've been better. The side felt too greasy and heavy compared to the lean main dish. It would've been better if they married the flat iron with the side from the thermidor. What a knockout dish that would've been!   We couldn't leave without dessert and with the recommendation of our server, we ordered the  kouign amann, which was topped with a scoop of ice cream. We were so full, we struggled to finish it. It was good, though it was not replacing any of our all-time fave desserts off our list.  Service was a mixed bag. Right from the get go, the table was set up, but the bench seats were full of food crumbs from the previous patrons. It was obvious they did not dust off food from bench seats while resetting tables. During our meal, it was hard to find someone to flag down to refill drinks, though they were quick to come by to ask BF if he wanted another old fashioned when he finished that drink. When our server was around, he was pretty good with conversation and recommendations. One thing I thought was weird was that if you charge the meal to your room, you don't get a receipt. We sat for quite a bit before we found our server and asked for a receipt.  Aria's concierge advertised this place as a romantic fine dining environment, but it's pretty loud, like a lounge. The noisiness makes it hard to hear each other, detracting from an otherwise excellent fine dining meal. The old fashioned drink, the bread, and the flat iron steak will remain in our memory for years to come when we think of Bardot.",

I started with the onion soup and it was delicious with so much melted cheese (maybe a bit big for a first course). I then had then scallops for dinner with a side of green beans (hey sue me, I like green beans) and the scallops were seared beautifully and the green beans delicious (maybe a bit to much salt on the green beans-one less shake of the salt shaker would have been okay)  For desert I had the warm cherry pudding with pistachio ice cream. I wasn't sure about the pairing of cherry pudding with pistachio ice cream but it works beautifully together. The cherry pudding was full of cherries!!  This is a very rich dessert and I could not finish it all but it sure was good",

The decor and ambiance are top notch, exuding a classy feel of a refined and upscale Parisian bistro. I also love the look and layout of their bar. Beyond this, that's where my disappointment started trickling in. Their house bread was for my preference, too hard. My latte was rather average. Their French omelette I'll have to say boasted great flavors. The cheese inside the omelette was very tasty, and the side salad with the vinaigrette cuts nicely into the heaviness/richness from the omelette. Before my main dish, I started off with their puff pastry escargot, and that I hate to admit was my biggest disappointment. Escargot is my favorite Parisian delicacy (I eat them almost everyday whenever I'm in Paris...probably not the healthiest thing to do). I definitely appreciate the different way they prepare them here, but it was quite honestly rather bland. If you're curious about trying this restaurant, I would still recommend giving it a go. Maybe at some point, I'll come back and try dinner...but I unfortunately had a less than stellar first  experience here.",

Our sommelier was friendly and very knowledgeable and eager to help us choose the wine that would best accompany our taste buds as well as the entire meal we had planned. The food was amazing. There are a few other comparable French restaurants in the Las Vegas area that I usually frequent when in town (out of courtesy I'll refrain from naming names) but this was my first visit to Bardot and it is hands down the best dining experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. The food was exquisite and everything was cooked perfectly. I tried a little bit of everything but the highlights worth noting (at least for me) were the foie gras parfait, the duck wings a l'orange, the mac and cheese (yeah you heard me right) and the chickpea fries with ratatouille and eggplant puree. Everything was perfect. I'm not very good at describing good food in text, but this was amazing and you have to try it for yourself.",

After 20 Minutes of waiting for a drink, a bar tender finally asked what we wanted. 10 more minutes and our drinks were ready, but we had to drag them out of the bar since our table was ready at that point.  Got to the table where we were promptly greeted. Unfortunately, when the waiter left, it was another 20-30 minutes before he came back. He took our order and when the food came, the options were tiny and the taste was that of an everyday store bought steak. Very disappointing.   We ordered a number of different wines by the glass, one of which was full of sediment. They took it off the bill, but at $34, it was still a disappointment.   We didn't bother trying desert as it would've taken another hour I'm sure. Overall, I would not recommend.  Bad service, bad bartenders, overpriced/under portioned entres.",

We started off with the Foie Gras Parfait (insane) and the King Crab Buckwheat Crepe (omg) we accompanied our starters with the Beet Salad with goat cheese (amazing). We moved onto our entrees where we shared the gnocchi (too good) and the special that evening was a 22oz prime rib with a Bordelaise sauce (we were crying it was so perfectly made).

    "text": "We went here based on the previous glowing Yelp reviews for the happy hour. The restaurant itself is beautiful, particularly the bar. We got there at 6pm, planning to get a few drinks and some snacks before our show that evening. I had to ask the bartender if they were serving happy hour which he then presented only the drink menu. I knew from fellow yelpers (and after calling the Aria concierge) that their happy hour -food and drink-is everyday from 5-7. I asked to see the HH food menu to which he replied \"we don't have that right now\". Ok...at the time I thought I must have misread something or got the times mixed up.  We  ended up ordering a few drinks and some food from the lounge menu. The steak burger was good, but the charcuterie plate's contents looked and tasted as if they had been sitting out in the open air for quite awhile. I was pretty bummed about the experience, especially since we made a point of walking here from the Cosmo before our show at Caesars. Next time I want a decent \"brasserie\" experience in Vegas I'll shlep over to Bouchon.",

Then as we are waiting, a photographer came around and took a complimentary family photo and printed as many copies we desired! Whaaaat? Then. Ok. The food. Oh holy. THE MOST AMAZING BRUNCH EVER. We all ordered a lot of food and tried everyone's food and EVERYTHING was beyond amazing! To the point where we all kept saying we couldn't try anything more. Yet still kept tasting, and finishing, everyone's dishes. Oh yes! And $20 bottomless rose! So the food- the best ever: carpaccio, onion soup (since it's a French restaurant don't need qualify), beet salad, quiche, burger, fries, croque monsieur, bacon, and so much more I can't think of. Oh wait! The complimentary pastries - oh yessssss.  Beyond delicious. And on top of all the deliciousness (and major shoutout to those in the kitchen), our server, Oscar, was so fantastic.  So helpful and gracious with all of us! And did I mention we had two toddlers?! Yes. That was it. I was generously treated by my bro and sis so can't speak on the cost, but I can tell you I am a local and even when I have to pay will definitely be back it was that fantastic of an experience!",

Our server would ask questions (frequently) as soon as either had a mouthful of food, and then stood awkwardly as we would chew, swallow, and then respond. He hurried our experience, and didn't seem to understand the European style allowing for the enjoyment of a delicious meal and spirits. The other clientele just simply ruined our experience. They were obnoxiously loud and rude (at 2:00 pm). I love Las Vegas and the fine dining opportunities afforded here. Unfortunately, this was loud, unorganized, and uncomfortable.",

    "text": "We set out on a Vegas evening with an idea of having steaks in our minds and better yet in our bellies. I had heard that this place had replaced the Michael Mina American fish restaurant and had seen some photos that had me interested for sure. First off this place is gorgeous on the inside with lovely fresh flowers everywhere and a classy European bistro feel. The other yelpers were speaking truth in that this is a noisy place which can feel exciting at night if you have a loud group of friends but maybe not a good place to catch up with older parents constantly yelling 'what?'. While we looked at the menu we realized there was far more than steaks that looked good to us and we decided that the three of us would do a French style tapas and have a bunch of dishes to share that way we could taste a lot without over stuffing ourselves. I had to ask the waitress to describe the fantastic and interesting way they do their macaroni & cheese because the photos from yelp make it look like a grilled slice of honeycomb that is hard to wrap your brain around but she says they use long noodles and bundle them together. It was my goal to order this dish and yet we were too full to.  We really enjoyed the mussels, the oysters, the bone marrow the onion soup with the deluxe options of oxtail and truffle (we decided not to get the egg). We were having trouble navigating the wine list and so our server sent over sommelier who was a very knowledgeable young woman with wine stained mouth I say this NOT to be disparaging but to include the tidbit that she really is doing the work of drinking and talking about wine and she's doing it well. She was cool! She suggested a very nice cinsaut that went quite well with everything and was at a perfect temp just a bit chilly. We tasted several desert wines before deciding on a Michael Mina wine that was Riesling and Chardonnay desert mix. It was all fantastic! Will most assuredly be back soon and often!",

    "text": "It's been two weeks since we thoroughly enjoyed a French bistro brunch weekend in Las Vegas and the tastes and sights linger strongly in memory.  Before reviewing our Sunday brunch experience at Aria's Bardot, allow a few words about Saturday's brunch at Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris. We had been looking forward to MAG for quite a while and made reservations through Open Table.   Three quick Mon Ami Gabi observations... 1) a seat at an open air pavilion table, while not directly overlooking the strip is still a most pleasant repast which didn't require a wait.  2) I've never seen a wait staff hustle through tight aisles so effortlessly, while balancing large trays of dishes high above their heads on extended arms and fingertips. Very impressive.  3) we had an issue with over cooked poached eggs. They were immediately replaced by not only freshly and perfectly poached eggs, but with an entirely new plate of corned beef hash (delicious, moist, well seasoned), along with a replacement of their wonderful hash browns and toast. This was True customer service...correct a mistake with an apology and a smile. Well done and much appreciated MAG!  Now, for the second half of our brunch weekend...Bardot Brasserie  While the newly designed space (formerly American Fish, also from Michael Mina) is elegant and very comfortable, there is no outside dining option as it's located on the Promenade level at Aria.  We started with the most unique Bloody Mary's we have tasted. Apparently, the barkeepers use freshly made vegetable juice and the addition of a cucumber strip in the drink adds a delightful taste and somehow lightens the drink. Delicious!  As I was about to break off a piece of the crusty loaf of French bread which was served in a paper bag, our brunch choices arrived. Previous reviews indicated that the brioche french toast was a must have dish. Have you ever been served a meal that required that you just stare at it as if you're trying to believe what you're seeing? Well, we did that. A huge thick (but light) serving which was crisp on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside. Accompanied by vanilla mascarpone and maple syrup, this, as well as the beautifully presented Swiss chard eggs Benedict made for a totally enjoyable and memorable Sunday morning treat. And there was no way we were not going to finish off that great loaf of French bread and butter.  The kicker, however was the side of bacon. Sourced from Neuske's, this must have been their triple thick bacon. A five dollar order was plenty for us to share and as good as the date glazed bacon was at MAG the previous day, the Bardot bacon was well, even better.  Excellent service...and coffee rounded out this experience.  Our bill was in the $50 range, but well worth it for such a wonderful brunch and quite frankly culinary memory.   Our only regret was that with plans already for our remaining two evenings, we didn't get a chance to come back for what I assume would be a great happy hour. Next time for sure.",

    "text": "This place is hot for a reason, it is amazing!  Out of the many high end restaurants I have been to in Vegas this year, the only one that beats Bardot is Picasso.  I was a little worried because I found the Micheal Mina restaurant at Bellagio to be pretty disappointing.  However, it is obvious there is major passion for this venue from either Mina or the executive chef as every item in every dish was executed with care and attention to detail.  First off, duck wings \"a l'orange\" is absolutely a brilliant idea and were every bit as tasty as you could want.  The accompanying whipped orange sauce was divine, came in a burnt hollowed out half-orange which somehow added extra complexity to the flavor.  Amazing!  The baguette and French butter were very good, up to the quality at Bouchon.  I went with the roast chicken as it's supposed to be the signature dish here, I usually would have ordered the cod but I had to admit this dish was beautifully prepared.  The \"mushroom bread pudding\" will be more like thanksgiving stuffing to us Americans and was delicious when the vin juane sauce was poured over the top.  For dessert an expert apple tarte tatin, a notoriously hard dish to get right and this was the best one I've ever had.  I only wish there had been two scoops of the artisan ice cream, so creamy and tasty.    Servers were running around like crazy and things are far from polished on that end.  Only the person who brought my wine (a great glass of Sancerre) seemed to have everything under control.  The server who brought my chicken missed the pronunciation for the sauce. This is still a pretty new place but I think they could invest more in training the staff.  Also, although the space is pretty the noise level is pretty high.  Definitely check this place out.  There were many Europeans dining there that night and I can see why.",

Not so much that it's annoying, but if you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner then it may not be the best place.   The restaurant itself is pretty cool and classy. Dark wood, high ceilings, lowish lighting. Comfortable booth seats.   We started off with steak tartare and the pate. Both were delicious but the tartare especially so. Very flavorful and came with crunchy potato chips. It was a hit. The large order was plenty for the four of us. The pate was good too, but not a must try.   Main courses: steak frites, steakburger, chicken French Dip, and oysters. I got the chicken sandwich. It was very tasty. Chicken tasted fresh and soft. Good bread helped and came with some crispy fries.  The steaks were cooked perfectly. Soft meat and decent flavor. I didn't try the steakburger but it looked great. I had a side of a macaroni and cheese dish which was really well made. Oysters looked fairly standard. All told, the meals were very good, but not mind blowing. Simple good meals with not a lot of frills.   Desserts: apple tart, chocolate macaroon, mille feuille, and lemon meringue tart. The desserts were all excellent, probably the best part of the meal. The apple tart was especially good and had great vanilla ice cream on top. Macaroon was rich, chocolaty, and big. My lemon tart was great, very strong lemon flavor. Definitely worth saving room for dessert here.   Service was decent, not amazing. Prices were okay. Overall a good place to go for fresh food prepared well and not outrageously priced.",

The service was friendly and attentive.  We ordered a few items to share.  I recommend doing this so that you can taste all of the deliciousness!  We selected the Pastry Basket, the French Toast, and the French Omelet.  The portions were absolutely huge and we could not finish our food.  The French Toast was massive!  I think that we could have been satisfied with just that one piece to share.  Yet, I was happy we ordered a few different items, as everything was better than expected.  I cannot wait to go back!",

We could've done a 3 course meal and it would've been more than enough. But I guess it's Vegas, so go big or go home.   1st course consists of family style appetizers: charcuterie board, duck wings a l'orange and escargot Bardot.   2nd- I ordered shrimp cocktail and a friend of mine ordered steak tartare. Normally not a big fan of steak tartare, but this was delicious.   3rd- I got the rack of lamb which just melted in my mouth. It was so so tender and bloody, the way I like my meat.   4th- dessert trio (creme brulee, chocolate macaron and profiteroles)",

For starters we did the duck wings a l'orange, escargots bardot, and bone marrow en persillade. All incredible flavors. The sauce for the wings was a perfect sweetness allowing for the wood grilled flavors to still come through combined with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce. Escargots strong as well. Unique dish with each piece wrapped in puff pastry. Bone marrow incredible. Very rich flavors supplemented with grilled bread to balance.   For entrees we did the king crab crepe, rack of lamb frites, and loup de mer ah fenouil (sea bass). Very delicious blend of flavors in the crepe. The crab flavor shines through despite the mix of apple, mushrooms, and egg. Lamb was perfectly tender. Large portions with a perfect mix of flavors. Interesting chickpea fries with spinach and tomato. Sea bass delicious. Light but flavorful. Cooked to perfection.   Dessert we had both the creme brulee and frozen Paris-Brest. Perfect sweetness and unique flavors in the latter. Almost like a fancy donut.   All in all definitely would recommend!",

Boy did we get lucky. Bardot is great.  The bread and salted butter are to die for. I could have these for every meal and die happy (and 400 pounds).  To start i enjoyed the beef tartare which was killer. the potato chips that they provide to put the tartare on were the perfect complement to the nicely seasoned combination of quail egg and beef. Definitely amongst the best raw beef dishes I've ever had, if not the best -- and I love raw beef.  I followed this up with the Loup-de-mare which was fantastic. The fennel combined with the fish made for a perfectly balanced flavor profile and texture with each bite. I loved this so much I finished it in about 5 minutes...well before anyone else finished their meals....I just couldn't control myself.  I highly recommend Bardot and can't wait to come back and try more of the menu...now if Michael Mina would just open a restaurant in Los Angeles proper - Dana Point and Glendale aren't Los Angeles, if they were they wouldn't be in other cities.",

We went with another couple for a Saturday brunch...and had an absolutely WOW experience!   The Rose was slightly better than the first time - as our glasses were never left empty! I had the Croq Madame again and was perfection! Lobster scramble was good, as was the Croissant benedict. Tried their escargot; I'm not an escargot person but their version wrapped in puff pastry was a nice touch. Also shared their signature item; French Toast! Out of this world...definitely recommend it as a 'dessert' for a group; it's massive for one person!  It's a thick slice of brioche french toast, vanilla mascarpone (outstanding!), almond brittle (delicious!).    Thanks, Bardot, for a fabulous, elegant Brunch experience! We'll be back!",

It was crispy on the outside but soft and custard like on the inside. The breakfast sandwich was ok. Tasted like a giant sausage McMuffin from McDonald's. American in Paris had thick cut bacon that was delicious. Hash browns came with both and were very crispy. I would recommend just note that it's kinda pricey but the potions are generous. The lady who helped us with water and boxes gave great customer service! Didn't really see our waitress except for when she took our order and gave us the bill.",

Paying $21 for a burger might seem extreme but it wasn't here. Their's was ground prime fillet and was perhaps the most juicy burger (and best?) I have ever inhaled. Think of the burger as a half priced steak that happens to be ground. Their Baked Alaska dessert was flamed table side using pineapple cider. The ice cream was smooth and rich, and the banana bread bottom provided a nice contrast to the sweetness of the ice cream. Great stop!",

We ended brunch with the Baked Alaska and it was definitely a show stopper that words do not do justice and it tastes even better. A MUST!! We are huge coffee lovers. The latte was so good I had to get it twice. And the cold brew was the best I've had yet. The manager said the chef created the creamer from scratch, you can even see the vanilla beans floating.",

We arrived at 6 and it wasn't all too busy but within the hour the place was hoppin.    I stuck with what I liked, the filet with Roquefort Fondue and black truffle fries.  Now I didn't want to get my hopes all high because it's happened in the past where I'll totally love a steak from someplace and when I go back again the mouth watering taste just isn't the same.  Not this place!  The steak was just as good as I remembered it if not better.  Still the best steak I've ever had.  We also did try the \"worlds best butter\" too and it was ok...it was nice and creamy and we actually found it better without the salt that it came with.    Thanks again Bardot Brasserie for blowing my tastebuds away.  I will be dragging all my friends and family here to bring them to this food paradise.",

    "text": "I forgot to check in and take pictures of my food, because we came here for a wedding reception. I gave four stars because it's hard to rate service when you're dealing with a large party.   As for the food, our starters and sides were pre-selected. We had chick-pea frittes (delicious, if you didn't know they were made from chick-peas, you'd think they were French fries.) Steak Tartare (just ok).  For our sides we had green beans and Mac n cheese which they left the plastic wrapping left on it and so I wonder if it's made from scratch or pre-packaged.   We had a choice of entree's from vegetarian pasta, pork chop (it looked delicious), chicken, and flat iron steak. We selected the steak and it was really good, very tender but the demi glaze (aka gravy) made it even better.   Dessert was an Espresso creme brulee and needless to say, mine got demolished. Not super sweet and it didn't have the eggy, custard taste to it, which made it different from the usual creme brulee.   I love French cuisine, so if I had the opportunity to explore their more exquisite French options, I'd give it a try.",

The $36 prefix was a small bowl of cold soup, a freezer burned overcooked dried out entree (that was either made days before or directly out of a Swanson frozen dinner box of 24 from Costco). Additionally there was an uninspired dessert square stamped out of pure sugar. My sense is they setup a lunch assembly line construct-o-matic meals that untrained staff could shovel out to the lunchtime rush. Obviously a tourist trap recipe. Aria should be ashamed and my respect/trust for this casino has been greatly diminished.",

In a hoity toity hotel and a high end restaurant, this is quite hard to come by. The service was excellent and, for a family of four dressed in casual wear, we were treated no different than the business suits sitting a table next to us.  The highlights include the baguette with salted butter that our family ate with joy. Yes its complimentary but its darn good too.  We ordered the poutine, the beef tartare, and three different tartines. Everything was good, but my favorite was the beef tartine. Reduced in red wine and served on a crispy tartine, they crack a hella fresh egg in top and what you get is pure awesomeness.  I don't get the opportunity to eat at an establishment like this, but when im glad that my experience here was a good one.",

    "text": "I had been drooling over the menu for weeks before our Vegas trip and was so looking forward to the brunch experience. There were three in our party and we opted for the bottomless Rose and this was a bright spot, as the Rose was very good. Order: Escargots Bardot, Nutella Sticky Bun, Truffle Fries, French Toast, Double Decker Ham and Brie, Croissant Benedict with Short Rib. Two best items were the fries and sticky bun - both were really really good and I'd recommend as a must have. The escargots had a weird texture (mushy) and a TON of garlic - and I'm a fan of garlic. We only ate a few because they were so off putting. The French Toast had a weird flavor, a bit over done and was definitely not rave worthy.  Double decker ham and Brie was dry and the flavor profile was not as anticipated. The croissant Benedict was very disappointing - very little hollandaise and the croissant was overdone. I'm writing this as someone who really enjoys food and has enjoyed versions of each of the items ordered from other restaurants, and this just didn't live up to the hype or my expectations at all. :(",

I've been for two of my birthdays, Valentine's Day, and brought my mom for her birthday, and each time I leave feeling like memories were created that everyone will always remember. The service staff goes above and beyond to ensure that you never need water, another cocktail, or have an empty plate in front of you. They are both professional and personable when interacting with you which of course ups the experience.   While I think I prefer going for dinner over brunch, I love the vibes given off during the day time. French pastries with amazing coffee, bottomless rose, and entrees like benedicts served on croissants and lobster scrambles-- how could you possibly not have a good time?   On my last experience our server Shannon took excellent care of us, and when I accidentally knocked over a wine glass *cringe* I was immediately asked if I was okay, and that it would be taken care of ASAP. The manager Gerti stopped by and also made sure that everyone was enjoying themselves and having a good time. I can't commend the staff at Bardot highly enough.",

However, what we were not told was that dinner service starts at 5 but orders could start at 430p.m. So, we could have just started with our cheese platter and drinks!!!. What???? Anyhow, service was exceptionally sub-par on Saturday March 23 from the front staff to the bar staff.  I asked for an espresso with one shot of milk . The dude gives me a deconstructed flat white with one shot espresso and cold milk on the side. Right. It took him ages to prep that and the other drinks.  Then, we waited about 25 mins just to get the cheese platter..which was good but at that point the neuroglycopenia ( hanger) kicked in. And we saw they were taking dinner orders.  Poor service for sure.",

But I was adamant as there was a list I had to try at Bardot. First I had mentioned that I detest chives and scallions. And guess what... chives sprinkled all over. Bartender tried to tell me maybe it's parsley... really... then when we paid, I looked at the check and found that a few dishes had the wrong price on it. Instead of apologizing, the manager was like. Oh yeah the prices were different from Saturday. Yeah today is Monday, you should just \"do your job\" like check all the prices on the POS system before your shift. Also did not acknowledge my friends bday...   dining room was beautiful. Wish service and food was better and we would have tried the Wellington which looked super good!!! Foie was itself was good. 2 stars for the beautiful room",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a Saturday night before clubbing with my girlfriend. We were greeted fairly quickly by our server, who was awesome.  I ordered a sidecar to start, but it had too much lemon juice and made the cocktail pretty sour.  We like to order several appetizers instead of entrees so we can nibble on things while we drink. The french onion soup is the best I've had. Perfectly balanced and not salty. The charcuterie board featured a delicious pate and pork rillette that you can spread on the nice pieces of toast that they provide. Be warned, however, there is no cheese on the board... you have to order that separately,  The beef tartare was very good, but I feel like it needed some earthiness of truffles or truffle oil. The potato chips were a bit too salty for my taste as well. The lobster thermidor was excellent, although a bit pricey. The pop tarte flambe was also an awesome dish, with cream and cheese oozing out.  For dessert, we ordered the dessert trio, which consists of chocolate macaron, a cheesecake napoleon, and creme brulee. When it arrived at our table we noticed that we received four different kinds of dessert. The last one was a small beignet looking pastry that was fluffy and delicious.  Overall, we had a great dining experience. Food was excellent and the service was even better. Had to knock off a star for the sidecar being too sour, and also for the table we were seated at for being too small for the dishes we ordered.  Dinner here is more superb than their brunch in my opinion.",

The bar is lovely, and you can be casual at the bar...no dressing up is necessary. Service at the bar is top notch.  Cocktails are artfully prepared and the wine list is very French.  The bartenders are also super cool and fun to chat with. The Midnight in Paris cocktail is super bright and refreshing.  Perfect on warm Vegas days.  The frites are delicious and come with a garlicky aioli.  The steak tartare is also solid. If you want to do an Aria crawl, I suggest cocktails and snacks at each of the bars throughout the resort.  Carbone is just across the way, but I've never been to Jean-Georges.  Julian Serrano, Catch, and Sage are downstairs.  I've never been interested in Herringbone.  It's the coolest way to dine around Aria during a short trip.",

I saw the French toast on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate as recommended by Scott Conant and noticed the stellar reviews on Yelp so had to try it out.   Ordered:  World's best butter Good butter... but not that much better than the free butter. Not worth the cost at all for $5/each. It should just be a $2 upgrade option at most. Complimentary bread is good.   Nutella sticky bun If you like nutella then go for it but wouldn't recommend since it can spoil your appetite, especially if you're going to have the French toast.  French toast It looks spectacular and tastes more like bread pudding than traditional French toast, very eggy and not too sweet. I definitely had higher expectations. Though, I think I would've enjoyed it a lot more if it wasn't for the Nutella sticky bun. It's definitely the best looking French toast I've ever ate.   Maine lobster scramble Horrible, literally just tasted like scrambled eggs with some herbs, spinach and cheese thrown in. Was very bland, a couple bits of overcooked lobster meat. Arguably the worst brunch item I've ever had, especially for $30.  Truffle fries I would come back just to order this to-go.   Herb hash browns This was good, well seasoned and huge portions but gets heavy quick.  Captain's Shandy Very refreshing  Probably one the most expensive and worst brunch I've had, which is unfortunate because I was really excited about this restaurant. The best things were the bread, sides and drink.",

Our server was very helpful and professional. We started off with a Hennessy based cocktail which was delicious (and dangerous) while looking at the menu. Everything we picked was great.  We started off with a Charcuterie Board consisting of prosciutto di parma, french dry salame, country pate, pork rillettes. I know many cringe at the sheer thought of pate, but it was one of my favorites growing up in Europe. Everything on the board was consumed with sheer satisfaction, and possibly un lady like urgency (I was hungry)! We also shared Octopus a la Basquaise featuring wood grilled spanish octopus, tarbais beans, chorizo escabechebanyuls vinegar, espelette chili, saffron rouille. This was another decadent dish which was light yet packed flavor. I also had french onion soup which is hands down the best french onion soup I've had to date (and I've had many).   Another lighter yet delicious selection was King Crab and Endive salad with Belgian endive, parmesan cheese, caper aioli, herbed bread crumbs. I could not believe how something that in theory sounds possibly bland was so refreshing and flavorful. We topped off our selections with Wagyu Wellington for two which was amazing but I don't remember too much as food coma (and those darn delicious cocktails) were starting to set in by this point. The bill was very reasonable taking into account the quantity and quality of the dishes sampled. I would go back and recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat!",

Bardot had a really nice interior - perfect for that classy meal.  We started with the Octopus a la Basquaise and had the Loup de Mer Provencal and Scallops Veronique for our entrees.  I also tried a little bit of the Beef Wellington.  Dessert was the Baked Alaska.  Everything was perfectly cooked and presented.  The tableside prep was pretty cool too - they carved the Beef Wellington (which was huge, btw) and set the Baked Alaska on fire for you right next to the table.  Service was outstanding.  Our waitress was friendly, able to answer all our questions, and was on top of making sure we had everything we needed.",

You post up at their bar for a drink and then get lured in by the very friendly bartenders and the \"world's best butter\" as an amuse bouche until you figure out your next plan of attack!  Had a lovely time chatting with the bartenders and munching on their fluffy but at the same time dense bread (that accompanied said superfluous condiment) and beef tartare. I had a different image in mind for the \"world's best butter,\" and while the presentation was fancy, it wasn't anything more than something you'd find at a diner (if that butter got into the closet of a royal for a night and decided to play dress up). The accompanying salt was my favorite part. And, to be perfectly honest, the bread was a standout on its own. The tartare was executed to perfection. The light, airy chips flanking it were a delight, but more decoration than a substantial vessel for the beef . I preferred lathering the tartare on to the bread. Did I mention I really loved the bread?  Fantastic service, great tunes, and a lively atmosphere once things picked up (clearly these bartenders are favorites amongst guests, as they drew a crowd of regulars) round out the opulent aesthetic and great bar program.",

Great ambiance w/ high ceilings, it feels like you're at a fancy restaurant in France!! Excellent service too, since the tables are small the waiters make sure to pay attention to you to take away used plates, etc.  The food on the other hand, was not so remarkable.  Nutella Sticky Bun - This was pretty good, but probably because it was the first thing I had and I was pretty hungry. It's a warm cinnamon bun with nutella! Can't go wrong with that :)  Omelette - This was meh....I can probably make a better omelette at home myself. I don't think we even finished it.  Avocado Benedict - It was my first time trying an avocado benedict so I have to say this is definitely worth a try if you're a fan of avocado like I am.  Everything is overpriced in Vegas so that was expected. I left the place feeling pretty full, but I guess my expectations were too high.",

We were a party of 6 celebrating a birthday and immediately upon arrival we were greeted by our server, Shannon, who was already recommended drinks and offered to answer any questions. I ordered the bottomless rose offered on brunch on Saturday's (best bang for your buck!). My glass was never half pass empty.   Shannon made herself available to questions on the menu and made honest recommendations. We tasted almost about everything for starters: escargot, steak tartare, pastrami cures salmon, their delicious charcuterie board, and an assortment of breakfast pastries and breads with their famous French butter.   I opted for the Hunter's Waffle and substituted scrambled eggs since I am not a fan of poached eggs, and also we had a couple of plates to shared of the French toast (I am not lying when I say this has to be the most delicious French toast I've had so far in my life).   For dessert we had an assortment of their chocolate cakes and their famous baked Alaska.   Shannon was a delightful the whole time and made our experience (a lot of us dining here for the first time) unforgettable. I would definitely recommend their brunch and would love to divulge in their dinner menu!",

By far, my favorite was:  FOIE GRAS PARFAIT w/ ruby port gelee, grilled country bread- I want to return just for this (we ordered both this & the SEARED FOIE GRAS). If you are not fond of foie gras w strong liver taste, this is the smoothest foie gras paired perfectly w sweet jam-like gelee, spread on a toasty country bread. If anything, their bread will make everything taste better. One of the best ive ever had.   ONION SOUP GRATINEE w/ cave-aged gruyere - Whatever happens in the cave stays in the c...heese??  I like restaurants that champion in their basics. You cant (or you shouldnt) go wrong w french onion soup in a french restaurant. *drool drool*  big enough to share for two.  I also had BONE MARROW AU POIVRE, but too greasy for my taste.. Maybe the onion jam will make it bearable. -------------------------------------  Honestly, was kinda full from appetizers and their killer country bread (beware!) but must finish review.  For Entrees/ Sides, we had:  BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE  SPINACH/ CHEESE SOUFFLE (daily special) - dont really know what this is supposed to taste like - it was like a bland pudding.. I was envisioning something like a spinach-cheese dip in taste, but not even close. You had me at.... souffle.... My soul is crying..  20 oz. dry-aged bone-in ribeye w bearnaise sauce 8 oz. filet mignon  Hmm, I guess you can't go wrong with steak.. But I think I liked the ribeye better. Honestly I need to return to rate the entrees again.. Good night.",

I was informed of a special dinner where they flew in a renowned Chef from the UK (Calum Franklin) to team up with their Executive Chef (who has also won awards) to prepare a special feast that what seemed to me was a meal fit for the royal family. It was my best meal I've had all year with a wine pairing that fit perfect. Desserts were presented to share and everyone couldn't believe their eyes and how they scaled up the portions. An outstanding sold out event and can't wait for the next one!",

We ended up getting the onion soup, the french toast, and a short rib benedict.   The service was great, and the food was delicious. My favorite was definitely the french toast. It was huge and we couldn't finish but I probably would order it again if I ever return. The onion soup was also amazing.

The lows ?  We were seated at an awful table near the place the waiters enter their orders to the kitchen and replenish silverware.  The waitstaff was constantly running back there and it was distracting and unpleasant.  Our server forgot to place our order to the kitchen for the charcuterie board we ordered.  One drink was not delivered.  When we finally received the charcuterie board it was disappointing and not as balanced as we would have hoped.  Also someone ordered something like a pate parfait and it was very odd tasting.  Overall, while a beautiful space, we would not recommend or return to Bardot Brasserie.  Giada's was pretty good though!",

    "text": "Bonjour Bardot.  Your food better be pretty darn good because I may need to finance this meal. And did you live up to expectation? Unfortunately for my wallet but fortunately for my belly, yes!    Sharing is caring so I got to sample several appetizers and entrees.  For starters, we tried the charcuterie platter ($27).  It was good; nothing too special.  The escargots bardot ($17 for six) were a bit disappointing because I thought the pastry shell and chartreuse butter overpowered the texture and flavor of the escargots.  The foie gras parfait was one of our favorites!  It was very smooth and delicate.  The port gelee's sweetness helped balance its earthy flavor.  For entrees, I shared the herb crusted Alaskan cod and pork chop with my sister. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. You can tell they brine their chops.  I also tried my cousin's sea bass and immediately understood why it's one of the signature dishes. D#@$% was that fish delicious.  Too bad we didn't offer to split our entrees with her too! Lol.  Oh, if you're a wine enthusiast, you will be happy to know that they offer an impressive collection.  But, it's not uncommon to see bottles of wine being sold in the four to five digit range.  I wonder if they run your credit card before you're allowed to order a $30K bottle?  Even though we enjoyed one of their bottles with \"value,\" there weren't many options under $200 to choose from! :)",

We got a table for 4 and had to change it to a table for 6 because two more friends had been on their way. The waiter was very kind and reseated us. When we arrived the server introduced himself (Oscar) and brought out fresh baguette with delicious butter. I had asked for gluten free bread but they didn't have any. It was totally fine. Oscar said he would get it for me if I knew of a place that served it in the Aria hotel but I didn't. What a super nice thing to do!!! Well, Oscar managed to actually get me some gluten free warm toast and came back a couple minutes later! WOW! Amazing and kind service! Thank you Oscar, you left an impression! Lovely to see when people love their job and service people so amazingly.  Delicious coffee and lobster scramble was amazing! Couldn't have been happier and fuller walking out of this place!",

They did serve them and we got to eat after everyone else had finished theirs. The bone marrow was okay but the other two looked like they were done in a hurry. The only saving grace was the Apple Tart Tantin which took a while because they make it from scratch.  Now that was excellent!  But dessert does not a French restaurant make!

    "text": "Growing up in the Restaurant Industry, I fault myself for setting ridiculous expectations only to have the majority of them never met.  My second trip to Bardot Brasserie left me full of humble pie.  We originally had a \"not-so-great\" experience our first time around, so we are usually very hesitant to dining with an establishment where the service and food were not hitting the usual marks.  However, I decided to give this venue another chance due to the outstanding reputation Michael Mina has as well as the fact that the GM, Roberto Liendo, personally reached out to me.   To have a restaurant succeed in Las Vegas, you need not only quality food, but a quality team upholding the standards that you strive to set and keeping such talent is often hard in a competitive market like Las Vegas.  Our meal started w/ a pleasant (and not ordered) surprise as we were sat.  The Sommelier quickly approached and poured a flute with Rose Champagne.  It wasn't overly sweet or dry champagne so it was perfect to wet our appetite for things to come.  Our Server Nicholas, came over right away with menus and seemed like he wrote them himself because of his innate ability to recall every preparation and ingredient in each dish.  Since Nicholas was so in tune with the menu, I went with my go-to methodology and let him decide what I was going to eat.  There are times where your server will push the \"special of the day\" if it's about to turn or priced a certain way to aid the bottom line/gouge the customer, however this was not the case.  He started us off with an order of the King Crab Crepe (buckwheat crepe, wild mushrooms and a Normandy beurre blanc) and a Tarte Flambee (flatbread w/ caramelized onions, gruyere, bacon lardons).  If there were only two dishes you can order at your next dining experience here, make these two the ones you choose.  The Crepe was stuffed w/ just the right amount of crab and the sauce was not too creamy or overpowering.  The pairing was spot on.  The Tarte Flambee can have its own review.  Bacon Lardons, nuff said.  We finished w/ an order of the Loup De Mer (European Seabass) and the Heritage Chicken Roti.  Normally, I don't order Chicken at restaurants since I can cook a mean bird, however I wasn't the one making the order.  So challenge accepted.  This chicken dish was out of this world.  It came with a side of mushroom & leek bread pudding that really needs to be added to the regular menu as a side as they would sell out each night because it's that irresistible.  I was informed by Nicholas that the secret of this dish is that the chicken is brined to keep it so moist prior to cooking.  The Loup de Mer was lightly grilled so the skin was a bit crispy but overall another winning dish.  If this meal taught me one thing, it was that you can't always trust first impressions.  I'm glad we gave this venue another look as the meal from start to finish, along w/ the hospitality shown by Roberto Liendo and his team was what most Restaurants should strive to achieve.  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had a wonderful dinner last month at Bardot the day after Valentine's for our 5th Anniversary. Not only is the location beautiful, but the food is also not so bad, you can never go wrong at a French Brasserie! Our reservation was at 8pm, we arrived early and noticed they had Happy Hour from 5-7pm so we sat in the bar and lounge area and enjoyed some small bites and a drink. We enjoyed the Oysters, Tuna TarTare, Steak TarTare, Skate Wing, Bone Marrow, and my favorite small dish was the Duck Wings A' L'Orange, yum! The hostess was very sweet and took us to our table early and the table was absolutely gorgeous set up with rose pedals. This was such a perfect way to start an anniversary dinner. When this restaurant used to be American Fish we surprisingly had the same server as we did this time at Bardot. It was very nice to see that Michael Mina kept on some of the staff from the previous restaurant. Our server's name is Jamison, he was fantastic; this visit as well as the last visit. He was very kind and knowledgable he gave us a great list of suggestions for our meal:  French Onion Soup Gratinee--make sure to add the truffle, OXTAIL, and soft poached egg. Salad Course: Frisee salad with bacon and poached egg. Entrees: I had the Ora King Salmon with lentils and a smoked tomato vinaigrette. My boyfriend had the Pork Chop that came with a horseradish potato, very strong on the horseradish.. Sides: Green Beans and Macaroni Gratinee (normally I would not order any macaroni dish out at dinner, but I'm glad we got it, because the presentation is so creative, each noodle sits straight up and came as a square block, really impressive.  Dessert: There is ALWAYS room for dessert! My boyfriend's mother is french and one of his favorite past times is when his mom would prepare her famous Apple Tarte Tatin from scratch.....so of course we tried it. Very tasty and the individual serving size is a great way to present this dessert. Also, we ordered the Coupe Glacee {{fancy words}} which was ice cream and sorbets. Our night ended with a beautiful pink rose handed to me, they were a special take home for Valentine's weekend!  The only thing that really bothered us during our meal was that we were sitting at a booth closer to the kitchen and the chef kept tapping on his bell for the food runners to come back. It was fantastic that the kitchen staff was not loud and we couldn't hear any silverware or plates touching each other, but the bell was reallyyy annoying! How about tapping the bell once? Or perhaps just hiring one or two more runners so the guests do not have to hear the bell and see the chef laughing after hitting it 12 times in a row! Other than that, great spot, love the remodeling, and ask for Jamison, you will be in good hands!",

The reason we will come back is for the Tartines.  We had both the Bouef Bourguinon and the Avocado Tartines.  We had never tried Tartines before, but have found a new favorite appetizer.  The bartender was friendly, professional, attentive and very good at offering advice on what was good.",

The chicken roti was nicely done although I would have put the lemon sauce on the bottom.  Serving it on top took away from the crispness of the skin. The savory mushroom bread pudding DID need a sauce badly. Overall the restaurant was okay but overpriced for the value and service.",

These two dishes were prepared to perfection. The foie gras was silky smooth and melts as soon as it touches your tongue. Served along with some toast and jam, the whole dish give hints of saltiness, sweet, and crunch to wet your appetite for your entree. When my rotisserie chicken arrived, it seem like a very simply roasted chicken but one bite into it and it was simply amazing. Accompanied with a sauce and some long bean, the chicken was tender and succulent. The skin crispy after hours of roasting pairs well with the tender chicken to give you such a sensation as you being to swallow it. Though we were stuffed for any desserts, i'm pretty sure that the desserts won't disappoint after such a wonderful appetizers and entree.",

Secondly, I'm not that hungry and was thinking of having an appetizer as my entree. My server repeatedly stated it was appetizer size. When I informed him I wasn't that hungry, he seemed annoyed! What is that?!? There are so many places we could go eat and I wanted to have a nice evening out. So far his attitude has really dampened my evening. Upon choosing the appetizer he pressed \"and what after?!\" I repeated that I wasn't that hungry and the plate sounded good and he seemed upset. Which makes me feel upset. We'll see how the food goes but what little appetite I had is now gone. :( No one should ever feel pressured to order. Whether a $50 meal or a $5000, service and care should be consistent across the board.",

Shady and guest started with a nice bottle of Rose' and moved on to the meal.  First off, the space is beautiful. A stunning bar greets you as moved towards the dining area. After a long perusal, Shady's gracious companion lusted for the seared foie gras, while Shady himself opted for the Duck wings L'orange. The foie gras was delicious, and was consumed immediately. The Duck was indeed delicious, but far too much work finding meat among the bones. As good as they were, Shady would order something else in the future.  On to the mains-The Lupe De Mer-Seabass was outstanding. Its hard to say it was better than the perfectly cooked Duroc pork chop, but with both being 4 stars, the nod goes to the seabass. A side of sprouts, some rest, then off to dessert. Another outstanding dish-The frozen Paris brest. Basically the most delicious saucers u can imagine.  The French fare was the perfect start to the Vegas binge. The service was great, the scene upscale bistro, and the food outstanding. Shady will have to revisit for the much heralded brunch. Bill was 273$ with the bottle, and includes Shadys signature bountiful tip.",

I won't list everything we had but for a non fan of French cuisine I was mildly surprised by the food.  Waiter, Michael, was great.  Only issue I really had was the noise level.  It was pretty loud once the dining room filled up.  I enjoyed the decor and vibe of the restaurant.  I would recommend it if you are in the mood for French.",

    "text": "Had two great prior experiences then poor service, food, and seating last night.  Server rarely appeared and couldn't even pronounce the food (in English - not looking for French pretense).  The fish was chewy and raw.  It's understandable that any chef can have an off moment and lose focus so no big deal.  Wasn't looking for a freebie but they offered to take it off my bill - but see comment about terrible service so of course it wasn't.    Inconsistency of food, service, and seating comfort is the death of any restaurant.  Be careful especially if you're entertaining guests or colleagues. I know it must be hard to find good help in this town, but at $150/person that shouldn't be my problem.   Would love to have addressed this with them rather than on Yelp but no one was available and their web site has no contact method.",

    "text": "Although nothing there reminded me of Brigitte Bardot, the decor was French like many Vegas brasseries. Unlike those other brasseries, the food was better here. We only came for the daily happy hour from 5-7P, but were very impressed by this recently opened Michael Mina restaurant.  The escargot en crout was so good, we ordered another plate of the tasty bites. The mild and soft snail was deliciously encased in a puff pastry shell rather than just topped with dough. The hazelnut \"salt\" and Chartreuse butter condiments and chives and mushroom garnishes were nice complements, but most were hard to eat WITH the escargot because they didn't attach to the pastry crust. To make it easier to eat, maybe a hazelnut and mushroom cream would be fun to dip into and adhere to the pastry.  They were out of skate wings, so we tried the salmon tartare instead. It was a smart combination of both fresh and smoked salmon that avoided the unpleasant tackiness when only fresh is used. I also liked the subtle use of capers and the thickly spreadable consistency of the chive mascarpone. Another smart choice was the sliced brioche which was friendlier to bite than a shattering crostini toast.  The \"HNYB Sour\" was a solid Cognac-based cocktail with a head of egg white and a float of Beaujolais.  Poorly positioned in the low foot traffic area of Aria's Promenade Level, it's located on the level above the casino next to the Zarkana theater.",

We passed on dessert but the selections were appealing and looked good. Nice classic and new cocktail selections and a wines are well thought out with the sommelier asking if he can assist.

The staff was extremely personable and worked with us almost like we were old friends. For alcohol, I only had one drink (rum based) and a sip of another (bourbon based) so I can't speak to all of the drink menu. But the drinks I had were great. The food was also great, from what I had and what my fiance had. I am not sure if the menu changes or not but it looks like it might rotate some items in. The atmosphere is also great, you lose the sense of being in the middle of a large casino. I did not get the reservation so I cannot speak to that but it was quite busy so I imagine you want to book ahead.",

    "text": "A decadent experience and meal from start to finish. When my friend suggested this as our next food adventure I was excited. This has been my list to try for awhile.  Located inside of Aria the restaurant was easy to find. Follow the signs from the casino to the restaurant area. The walk from the parking garage wasn't too bad. Bardot is in the same area as Herringbone, The Buffet, and Carbone. The inside of the restaurant feels like a French bistro and has a nice ambiance.   Enjoying a leisurely meal we started with two appetizers and a soup. Everything sounded so great on the appetizer menu or hors d'oeuvres as it is labeled on the menu. The French bread brought out to begin was perfectly crunchy and tasty. This was a great way to enjoy the butter sauce with the crepe which we did shamelessly.   The French Onion soup was amazing with a nice amount of bread in the soup and a broth with amazing onion flavor. The layer of cheese on top was thick and the cheese just kept coming with each bite. A decadent soup for sure. The King Crab Crepe was a flavor explosion at first bite. I could not believe how much flavor was in something seemingly so simple. Everything was fresh and the crepe was perfectly prepared. We enjoyed this dish without the sauce served on the side by mistake and still found it incredible. The Steak Tartare was fresh and flavorful. The potatoes to enjoy the tartare on were prepared like a chip were incredibly delicate and delicious.  Sweets are a necessary guilty pleasure and we were getting full so we decided to skip to dessert. Narrowing to three choices wasn't easy, but we selected Cherry Clafouti, Mille Feuille, and an Apple Tart. All three were amazing, but Cherry Clafouti was my favorite. It was a unique dessert that was like a cross between bread pudding and custard. The delicious tart cherries adding plenty of flavor and the pistachio ice cream on top was so delicious.   The service was attentive and polite. Our waitress checked in on us frequently and accommodated our requests. Since the table was small the staff paid special attention to clearing plates frequently which I appreciated.   I'm already looking forward to returning to Bardot for another lovely evening. This is a great spot for a nice night with a friend or a date night. The food was outstanding and one of my more notable meals lately!",

    "text": "The restaurant is located inside of the Aria hotel in Las Vegas, and it can be somewhat difficult to locate. It's a very casual, French restaurant, but their ambiance and bar-like atmosphere makes it quite the experience. We came at around 6pm with a reservation for four, and the table we were seated at was spacious and comfortable. The waiters were very kind, and brought us water and french baguettes to start with. The baguettes were very fresh, warm and soft on the inside while crunchy on the outside.   We decided to skip out on the appetizers, and order entrees. We ordered a double cut rib eye, the lamb chops, and a pork chop. My brother and dad both ordered the double cut rib eye, but my dad's steak cooked medium had more flavor than my brother's steak cooked medium rare. The steak was very well cooked, and there was a great, smokey flavor. My mom's pork chop was also amazing--it had a deep, smokey bacon flavor from the bacon condiments on top. My lamb chop, unfortunately, was the most disappointing. It lacked flavor and it somewhat tasted like raw sashimi (which was, in my part, my own fault since I had ordered it medium rare). The quality of meat was great, but I wish there was more seasoning and a bit more time on the grill.   We ended up each ordering a dessert, since everything on the menu looked amazing, and we got two baked Alaska, a macaroon, and a napoleon looking french pastry. My favorite was the macaroon, which had a lot of chocolate, but wasn't sweet at all. They also pour warm chocolate on the macaroon table side. The baked Alaska was a show in it of itself--the waiter poured flaming bourbon onto the cake to toast the marshmallow. The baked Alaska was light, but I wasn't a fan of the strong alcohol taste.   I would give this place a 4.5/5, but I am rounding up because of the service and the amazing steak, pork chop, and macaroon dessert. I would recommend this place if you're staying in Vegas, and if you're looking for a more casual dining experience.",

    "text": "Great and affordable French food in Aria  My recent trip to Vegas caused me to eat at 3 different French restaruants: Bardot Brassiere, Mon Ami Gabi, and Bouchon. Bardot Brassiere was by far my favorite one.  We went there for brunch at 11AM, had reservations but the restaurant was about 1/4 empty so not sure if it's necessary. The restaurant is located inside the Aria, and is very tastefully decorated with a nice excerpt from Heminingway on the wall. The hostess quickly sat us down, and the waiter quickly came by, got us water and menus. While waiting to place our order, they brought over French bread and butter. Some of the best French bread I had, although I've had better butter (was still tasty).  I got the goat cheese and mushroom quiche, while my friends got the French Toast. The quiche is literally the best quiche I've ever had (Admittedly, I haven't had many quiches). It was rich, flavorful, and the mushrooms were absolutely scrumptious. The small salad (e.g. pieces of lettuce) that came with it were seasoned simply, but also yummy. The French toast was the largest piece of toast you'll ever see (literally it's the size of your face). It comes with some sort of caramelized nut triangle on top, some whipped butter, and an amazing syrup (I don't even know how to describe it). Every bite was delicious and rich, and given that the French toast was probably at least 1 to 2 lbs, we were unable to finish it.   I would definitely come back here in the future if I have another chance. The Nutella sticky bun looks amazing, and I'm also a sucker for the Prime Rib French Dip.",

    "text": "Slave girl and I were looking for a place to get brunch and we found out Bardot Brasserie had brunch until 1:30pm with bottomless mimosa. Yes please.   Bardot was beautifully decorated and very well lighted inside. The bar was very busy especially with bottomless mimosa.  We ordered steak tartare, truffle fries, French toast, and croque madame.  We started with complimentary baguette with salted butter. I know nothing about how to make butter magical, but the butter that came with was really good especially the part had salt on. I tried to use regular table salt and they just didn't taste the same.   Steak tartare was excellent. The steak was grounded to order mixing with sauce verte and egg yolk. Severed with gaufrette potato chips. It had creamy texture and good flavor.   Croque madame came with pain de mie, Paris ham, gruyere fondue, and a organic egg on top. It was good but it didn't wow me like the one I had in San Francisco.   Slave girl told me the French toast was one of the best she ever had. Since I only had a bite, I would say sure, why not. It came with brioche French toast top with vanilla mascarpone, almond brittle, and organic syrup.   Truffle fries was a bit fail in my book. Sure it was done well, but I didn't get too much of truffle flavors which defeated the purpose of \"truffle\" fries.   The service here was fantastic. It was a full house but my mimosa was never empty. Matter of fact, it was filled before I even finished the glass. On top of that, our server was also training a new server too. Great job for sure. We will go back to try the dinner menu.",

While we were sitting on the lovely outdoor seating area trying to figure out a plan for lunch he was kind enough to bring us 2 cups of lovey cold water in plastic cups and advised us to keep hydrated with all the hot dry air. That was such great customer service to people who weren't even customers at the time. I really appreciated the kind gesture. When we came the next day for brunch I asked what the gentleman's name was who had been in the front yesterday and described his features and as I was doing so we spotted each other and I expressed our excitement to be back for actual brunch. I came to find out that his name is Matej and he is the manager, a great manager at that. We had an excellent server, Oscar who was funny and helpful. In the middle of the meal Matej came by to check in on us and we let him know how delicious everything was. Loved everything from the yummy softened salted butter and baguette to the savory sweet Foie Gras and the French toast was the best my husband has ever had, everything we had was delicious. At the end of our meal Oscar let us know that Matej had filled him in on our little mishap from the day before and had sent out delicious complimentary desserts for the birthday boy and my husband for Father's Day. Both of the reasons why we were celebrating. Definitely recommend Bardot for the amazing food and service. I really appreciate it when a restaurant knows there are literally hundreds of good restaurants in Vegas to dine and value you as a customer.",

No like the bacon is the best piece of bacon I have ever had in my entire life. I usually don't order double cut bacon because it's always so chewy but it really was like a slice pork that just melted in your mouth. Other items that were amazing which a must order is the pastry basket and the French fries. All three of these items mixed with the service which was awesome.

When we finally parked I literally had my group make an effort to run all the way to the restaurant.  We arrived at 1:46 PM. And the hostess told us that their maximum late time frame was 15 minutes. And kitchen was closed for brunch.  I understand we were in the wrong being late.   BUT 1 MINUTE?!  They brought the manager out and you clearly treated me like I was just another random number. I explained to him I worked in the service industry before and we would gladly not be a hassle and order a simple dish that's quicker to make.  He then walked off into apparently speak with the shop and request permission but I think he just went for a nice walk in circles.  Moral of the story. Treat people with empathy. It was 1 minute. You could make a persons day with that simple okay I'll let you slide.",

We started with some mimosas which were top notch--just the right blend.  They brought out a little baguette with butter that was really good.  I was thinking about getting the eggs benedict--but was not sure about putting it on croissant--so instead I ordered the cheese omelet.  It was cooked well, but really light on the cheese and not that flavorful.  It came with a side of salad, which was kind of odd, but tasted good.    I really did not like the hash browns.  It was kind of a fried block of potato--a little like a giant french fry.  I think some might like it that way, but not me or my friend.  My friend ordered something called the American plate with two eggs.  She ordered them over easy--but they were really likely cooked.  Fortunately, I ordered a side of bacon that was excellent--I would definitely order that again.",

I can't say that I'm often caught by surprise when it comes to restaurants but I definitely was on that night. I had a very lackluster experience at Hell's Kitchen the night before which I had very high hopes for (Gordon Ramsey you are 0-2) so I tried to keep my expectations in check. I had the 5 course prix fixe for $175 plus a few drinks and tip, not the best $280 I've ever spent. Main course was the beef wellington which was very bland and not prepared correctly, but this isn't about Hell's Kitchen and what they did wrong this is about Bardot and how they amazed!!!   We started with drinks, I had a house cocktail (midnight in Paris) that was excellent. For apps we ordered the escargot with garlic butter sauce and oysters. Both we exceptional but the escargot was the better of the two easily. For entrees my wife and I had the beef wellington for two. My mother in-law had the duck L orange and my father in-law had the filet. All three dishes were amazing but the beef wellington might be one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life, it was that good. I won't really get into sides other then to say that they more than held their own in the plate and the truffle mash could have been it's own meal it was so good. I'm not sure why this place isn't a 5 stars across the but it's definitely my new favorite spot in Vegas and I will be here again. My only real regret was that we had to make a show and couldn't stay longer to try more dishes.    Thank you to chef Smith and everyone else that made this such a great experience, see you guys seen.",

The French restaurant is located in the Aria, and it has a formal dining area and bar area. I made a reservation for a Thursday night.   My table started with a bread and cheese plate that also came with spreads and jam. We asked for additional toasted bread. The plate was delicious. My favorite was probably the jam and toasted bread but all of it is good. I ordered the duck breast prepared medium. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It's certainly meant for more than one person as there was no way I could finish it alone. Hands down the best thing we ate was the gnocchi. It literally tastes like garlic, potatoes, and butter melting in your mouth. I've never had anything like it. Please do yourself a favor and order it. Also great wine, enjoyed a Malbec.",

The tartare was good, but a little bland. The potato chips made all the difference. The prime rib sandwich.. delicious! The meat was super tender and the au jus was savory with the perfect amount of saltiness! The truffle fries were also amazing. I would recommend you pay the extra 4 bucks for them, you could definitely taste the truffles!",

The place is gorgeous inside and outside, I love it! The signs are in French and the theme is very well done. It gives all the French feels. I ordered 2 tartines: the avocado tomato tartine and the shrimp tartine. They were both really good. Healthy fresh and decent portion. The toast comes very crispy. My favorite was the shrimp, be aware there's some spicy peppers but if you are like me, you can remove them easily. I would order this dish again! Friendly staff, pleasant dining. I hope to come back for a seated dinner. I recommend this for a date as it's a fairly romantic setting.",

Just a real nice guy with a smile for everyone. Shout out to all the employees here who clear plates and are on top of refilling water. The two hostesses were also very sweet helping us with directions to main valet when we asked on our way out.  A few things we noticed and were personally disappointed in: No more bleu cheese sauce offered as a choice for filet, didn't get the volcanic rock salt with worlds best butter (it was just regular table salt) and they cut my husbands filet in half (maybe to check if it was medium rare?) to serve. Not sure if these are budget cuts or these are just new choices management has made?",

    "text": "This French restaurant is know for their French toast and I had to find out for myself why. Came here during brunch and ordered a ton of food! We started with the la fromage board: mimolette, rockaport (bleu Cheese) and raclette. When I saw raclette, I was hoping for that melted cheesy stuff, but it wasn't.  It was still in its original form and was very mild compared to the other choices.   The French toast lacks color, but the sweetness from the syrup definitely made up for it! The toast was crunchy on the outside and very soft inside. I drowned the bread in that sweet syrup which made it a little soggy. The peanut brittle wasn't my favorite part of the dish, but my friends loved it.   The steak tartare was a little too greasy and oily for my palette. And I wish the\"chips\" provided were a bit stronger so I can eat it with the tartare on top. It broke into pieces by the time it reached my mouth.  The prime rib sandwich was delicious! I ate it without the bread and dipped it in their au jou and it tasted like heaven. Definitely recommend this dish!  Ambiance is intimate with their dim lights and excellent customer service. I'll be back soon for their dinner service and check out their menu then.",

The Mac n Cheese is MUST here. Noodles all standing in the pan with a nice cheese crust. Decor is beautiful. Service could have been a little better. Waiter wasn't always on top of things.

While the pasta was good, the apps were out of this world and I could have made that my entire meal. Of course, you have to flush everything down with some bottles of wine, which they have no shortage of here.

The staff is very helpful and accommodating. We had our luggage with us and without asking,  the hostess offered to hold our bags.   Our waiter was attentive but not personable,  which was fine with us because we didn't feel like having a lot of chatter this morning after a long night out the day before.  We ordered the lobster scramble, French toast with a side of bacon. The scramble was delicious and exquisite. The French toast however lacked flavor and came with this really strong almond syrup. It wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't traditional French toast. I wouldn't order it again. The bacon is thick and tasted like honey baked ham. Beautiful restaurant in the Aria casino. I would love to come back.",

    "text": "For starters I'd like to say that this most recent visit was so night and day from my previous which really does show that all places (well given the reasoning involved) deserve a second chance.   On day one of a now very distant trip to Vegas I reluctantly gave brunch here a shot based on my past experience, but I'm so glad I did. Go figure seeing it on a travel channel best of food show planted that seed, but now I don't think I'd ever go anywhere else should I have the brunch itch yet again.  The wife went for the Hass Avocado Croissant Benedict and although it was our first time devouring one boy can we say the bar has been set high here. They pretty much use a whole avocado for this and no doubt the freshness was there. What stood out to me though was the bearnaise sauce. I've tasted a few here and there, but this was very creamy and the herb mix even on its own tasted superb!  I took a different spin as I'm more of the gluten of the ground. As a side (which was really a costar of the show) the double-cut bacon is outstanding. It certainly is a portion which could be shared, but it's everything bacon should be. Prepared to spit out tender love and sticky coating to send your taste buds sizzling on a hot plate.  What I can not even begin to describe up even till now was the French Toast. It's their claim to fame and with good reason. The brioche is devilishly soft and not as heavy as I expected. The vanilla mascarpone though is an explosion of sweet all over your body. Your stomach definitely feels like it rolled a 7 with each bite! The almond brittle sadly I didn't care much for, but for me it was forgettable and I just set it to the side.  There is so much left to be desired here and I should warn the staff now you'll be sick of my face shall I happen to make it out on a Saturday and/or Sunday. Haha",

French toast - get it, without a doubt this was my favorite thing (ask for regular syrup though)  Nutella thing was really good, really rich and definitely could be shared by 2 or more people, another dish I liked.  Besides that, it was your pretty typical breakfast joint, eggs, croissants, biscuits, etc. Nothing that was super memorable. I also do not know how much the final bill was but if I knew... I might dock another star.  THE VERDICT: Once you run out of other breakfast places to go, this is a place worth trying eventually. Do you need to go out of your way? No. But if you are in the aria I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "With temperatures in Las Vegas now surpassing 100F daily it might seem like Brasserie Fare would be a bit too heavy, but on Saturday, much as they have for over four years, Josh Smith and the team at Bardot again put on a spectacular show complete with old favorites and new plates in tune with the season.  Dining on this day as a party of nine, a range of ages from single digits to senior citizens seated at a long table near the Restaurant's central display of flowers, it was with greetings from familiar staff that the evening started off with a complimentary pour of Bubbles, the 2008 Rose crisp and not too sugary which allowed it to pair nicely with starters including ground to order Tartare and a daily special of Pate en Croute with big flavor inside golden Pastry from Sous Chef Ty Clark.  Not even trying to resist Bardot's city-best Baguette, discs of imported Beurre d'Echire spread liberally over the still-warm center, it was next that a labor intensive Salad of King Crab and Endive competed against two types of Foie Gras for top billing, the Parfait still stunning in terms of texture but \"Rossini\" even more decadent thanks to braised Beef, Black Truffles and Sauce Bordelaise.  Traveling south for Spanish Octopus with heat and acidity, notes of Saffron perfuming each mouthful, it was not long before old and new ideas arrived on wood, Bardot's infamous Escargot good as ever inside Puff Pastry with plenty of Garlic and Chef Smith's bar menu \"Pop Tarte\" showing whimsy without compromising the classic combination of Cheese, Onions and Bacon with Bechamel added at the end to resemble \"Frosting.\"   With half of a wood-grilled Lobster rounding out Appetizers, because at Bardot the highlight of many French Restaurants does not need to wait, it was with serviceware reset that Entrees began to arrive steadily, a thick Pork Chop standing up to both Mustard and Horseradish thanks to sourcing and smoking while four plump Scallops from a fleet out of New Jersey shine with natural sweetness amidst a melange of Summer Produce dressed in Brow Butter, Herbs and Sherry.  Never forgetting vertical Macaronis, though this season's Semolina Gnocchi with Tete de Moine, Mushrooms and Squash in two forms is also a meatless show-stopper, those looking for lighter options may also wish to investigate Roasted Organic Chicken served alongside Sauce Vin Jaune or all-new Sea Bass served with crispy Skin, fried Potatoes and a subtle hint of licorice.    Not lacking in accoutrements, the Chicken's cast-iron crock of Bread Pudding and brilliant green Falafel offered with eight Bones of New Zealand Lamb both particularly worth mentioning, it was as Chef Smith carefully carved Beef Wellington tableside that guests delved into Duck Breast brightened by Citrus, though no matter how good the Fowl with crispy Skin there is still no better dish in Sin City than Bardot's Prime Beef protected by Puff Pastry and served with Foie Gras-Madeira Veloute.  Seventeen plates and three sides in at this point, several of the Appetizers additionally ordered double, it was refreshed by Espresso that Dessert came next, a special request for Brunch's French Toast granted and predictably wowing first timers while old favorites such as the signature Chocolate Macaron, Espresso Creme Brulee and \"Cheesecake\" Mille Feuille rightfully retain their place amidst newer additions such as Strawberry Shortcake Baked Alaska flambeed tableside.   Frequently honored to 'test' new ideas, Chef Smith describing \"Gateau Basque Gooey Butter Cake\" as the fusion of his Grandmother's all-American recipe with a familiar French classic, it should seem fairly obvious to those familiar that the addition of Cream Cheese and even more Butter to something already rich is over-the-top indulgent, while the Pineapple Tarte Tatin introduced in March remains arguably Bardot's best new dish of 2019 thanks to its diversity of taste, texture and temperature.  FIVE STARS:  Already America's best Bistro or Brasserie, Summer 2019 sees Bardot at Aria continue to evolve by seamlessly integrating classic technique and clever ideas into elegant plates that look and taste as good as what one will find throughout Europe.",

Each dish I tried was better than the last, from appetizers through dessert.   The French onion soup was a special favorite, and might truly be the best version of this soup I've ever had. Even the broth was scrumptious. But the goblet it comes in is HUGE. Share this one!  The tuna tartare was a pleasant surprise! I'm not usually a fish fan, so I was delighted to find this dish so tasty.   The duck wings with orange sauce are out of this world! Just do yourself a favor and order it, and don't forget to dunk a bite in the yummy hollandaise sauce served in a little orange half. Mmmmm!  The filet mignon was perfection. So tender, so tasty. And the fries served with it (frites) were so rich and delectable -- no doubt thanks to the beef fat they are cooked in.   For dessert, I tried the rum cake and the creme brulee. The rum cake was a bit strong for me, but that creme brulee was fantastic. It hardly lasted a full minute on the table before being gulped up.   This place is superb. Can't wait to come back and try brunch!",

The selections are wonderful and I highly recommend the beet salad or French onion soup....both of which are quite tasty, although the FO soup could use significantly  less salt. It turned out to be a harbinger of over salted main dishes, including the Pork Chop and Steak Dinners. So salty, in fact, that I would not return. Suggestion/Request: Use little to no salt, and put shakers on the tables for those who need more, and more, and more.",

I was surprised with the quantify and quality of the lobster - no skimping here. Plus the light touch of caviar on top really set this dish apart. Highly recommend this place!

    "text": "Located on the promenade level of the contemporary Aria resort hotel, this newly reimagined french brasserie has all the flair of a casual street side Parisian bistro sans the French accent, of course. I made reservations for weekend brunch and strolled in at about 12:45pm to a fairly full house bustling with a variety of diners sobering up from the previous evening of debauchery I could imagine. The hostess kindly greeted me at the entrance and escorted me to the back of the restaurant where the dining tables were located. From there, I met the server who was agreeably friendly in a casual way and took my orders in a snap.  First to arrive was the king crab crepe served with a bechamel sauce. The crepe was rich, flavorful and it was served perfectly thin and not overly bulky like some crepes I've had the displeasure of experiencing in the past. I would have liked to see more lump crab in the crepe but the amount served was sufficient to maintain the integrity of the dish. The addition of the fried egg made for a beautiful marriage of flavors and textures, which had me savoring each wonderful bite. A great start to my brunch and it whet my appetite for the subsequent dishes on my brunch line up. Next up was the lobster benedict on a light and airy puffed pastry. I was mildly disappointed when I spied what appeared to be langoustines and not lobster tail chunks. It's just a matter of preference l but I feel the lump lobster would have been a more impressive accompaniment to this delightful dish but I'm sure cost played a big role in their decision to use langoustine. All in all, it was a tasty dish and I enjoyed the use of the flakey pastry, which was a refreshing departure from the traditional English muffin. The final dish to adorn our table was the duck confit waffle benedict. Served with a citrusy blood orange maltaise, rustic root vegetable hash and perfectly poached egg, this majestic brunch dish was nothing short of stunning. The duck was warm tender and beautifully balanced in flavor. Usually a confit is typically too salty for me but this preparation was just right. The light and fluffy waffle drizzled with the maltaise sauce and the heavenly poached egg added just the right amount of decadent richness to this praiseworthy dish. #eggporn galore!  Overall, service was agreeable, fairly attentive, and the food was reasonably paced. What Made me a fan was the food! I'd gladly return to enjoy more of that enticing brunch fare when I trek out to SinCity.  Until then... Happyeats!",

Friendly, attentive and a great start to a fabulous meal.   The venue is stunning. It's has all the making of an amazing space that caters to all aspects of the city.  The service was top flight and attentive. We wanted for nothing.   The number of items on the menu is impressive. The charcuterie is exceptional. The Frisee salad was amazing. We all had steaks and sides. They were cooked perfectly.   They have made some management and staffing changes since my original visit and review. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Overall - Bardot Brasserie is a wonderful experience and I recommend dinning at this fine establishment.   Now to the GOOD specifics:  The atmosphere here is lively and fun. It has a great vibe and much energy. Our server, Nelson, was wonderful. He was polite, knowledgeable, and seemed to really care about us. Our main dishes were fantastic. I had the Filet Mignon and my friends both had the Sole Meuniere. They were both top notch. The flavor and quality are worthy of a 5 star rating.   Now the NOT SO GOOD specifics:  We had ordered an $88 bottle of Katheryn Kennedy Cab. from the Sommelier (sorry I don't have his name). As often happens, I expected him to counter with a similar wine up sell. He did that with a much higher end Katheryn Kennedy selling for $700! I understand sales and up selling very well, but that is a huge jump and bad business. Who knows, maybe an up sell of $20-$30 would have worked but if I'm ordering an $88 bottle of wine I can't be up sold for a bottle more than my round trip flight from New York!  As great as the main dishes were, the side dish and dessert were lacking. We shared the side dish of Blistered green beans (lemon butter & almonds). Well they were shockingly tasteless. We also ordered the chocolate macaroon for dessert and it was average at best.   The main dishes, atmosphere and Nelson the server were so good I was thinking 5 stars here most of the evening. I had to take 1 star away for the side dish, dessert and suggestion from the Sommelier.  Hey - 4 stars is fantastic and I will be back next time I'm in Vegas. Maybe Bardot can up sell me to a 5 star rating next time :)",

I think it says everything that many of us found ourselves with rose in one hand and a Bloody Mary in the other within 15 minutes of sitting down to eat.  The Nutella cinnamon rolls were one of the best sweet breakfast items I've ever had. The brioche French toast was filthy rich and if you brunch at Bardot without ordering it you're a fool. ;) Lastly, the lobster Benedict is served atop a puff pastry and covered in a beautiful hollandaise.   Needless to say I was overly satisfied after this indulgent meal, but it was worth the inevitable food coma. Head to the pool, get another drink, and keep going - it's Vegas!",

The $80 menu was a lot stronger compared to the $50 menu (or at least our selections) as all three items from the second menu were my favorites of the evening. The King Crab Crepe and Lobster Thermidor were outstanding dishes! If you haven't had this preparation of lobster, you must try it here. It is absolutely delicious. I love many lobster dishes, but this one is on top of the list. Plus, the Chocolate Macaron caught me by surprise. I wasn't really expecting much of it, but the macaron itself had a great consistency and the mousse was lovely. I didn't want it to end!  Though we thoroughly enjoyed our food, service was blah. When we sat down, our server forgot to come to our table (he admitted this), so we waited for quite some time without beverages or menus (even worse for a restaurant with many, many people walking around, including managers). Our server was nice, but he wasn't available very often. He would show up immediately after our food would arrive - basically, when we didn't need anything, but rarely showed otherwise. It was even troublesome to receive water refills. He had a couple tables directly next to us and would literally forget to stop by when checking on them. After we finally got the check, I couldn't flag down a single person to pick up my payment. I was seriously holding up the book with my card sticking out and still, it took several minutes to get anyone's attention. Our overall experience wasn't terrible, but it did leave a bad taste in our mouth and I definitely expect more from a Michael Mina restaurant.  I do wish to try their brunch and am willing to give their service another shot!",

Here are my verdicts: - French onion soup: love the top crust. It's beautifully golden, and when u open it with your fork, u feel the cheese underneath. - prime rib eye: it's good but not the best I had. Perhaps I like it with slightly more fat. - hunter's waffle: interesting twist from classic egg Benedict. They put duck confit in between a waffle and the runny egg. I wish the chef would consider to put some fresh green like lettuce or arugula with this dish to \"freshen\" up the taste of the whole dish. - escargots: 4 pcs. Thought it would come in 6 pcs as I saw it from other Yelpers' photos. Regardless that, the whole dish is good.   Will come back and try their famous French Toast!!",

    "text": "This afternoon, a close friend and I enjoyed a lovely brunch. The food was great and the service was good. However, one employee went above and beyond the call of duty and I believe needs to be acknowledged. His name is Oscar.   Shortly after receiving our meal, my friend wanted ketchup and orange juice. Our waitress was not around, so we asked another passing by. That waiter agreed to help, but never returned. Oscar passed by and was given the same request. Before he could return, our waitress showed up and we told her of the request believing that the others had relayed the information to her. Shortly there after, the waitress returned without the ketchup proclaiming that the restaurant was \"out of orange juice\" and that someone was sent downstairs to get more. However, less than 60 seconds later, Oscar arrived with both ketchup and a full glass of fresh OJ. Our waitress never returned to address this issue.   While our waitress did a fine job, in general, it was Oscar who seemed to go above and beyond for a table that was not his responsibility. When leaving, we attempted to give him a separate tip, but he refused. He said that he loved his job and that sometimes it's just good to do the right thing. So, for that, Oscar is to be commended!  Great job and Thank you, Oscar!",

They had just began happy hour so instead of $26 glass of pinot noir,received a glass of Acacia pinot  for only $8. Score! The restaurant was about 1/4 filled but it was a 10 minute wait to set the table...not sure why son e the tables were already all set.   Service was mediocre,our server took about 10 more minutes to get us waters which was heavily chlorinated. In a restaurant where you serve good food, maybe invest in a ro system for water?  We ordered 4 courses of appetizers :  1) escargot- too buttery ,nauseatingly rich because the butter was trapped within the pastry 2) king crab crepe- light texture but also too heavy on butter,trumpet mushrooms were a nice touch 3) foie gras parfait- light, fluffy and melted perfectly  4)prime beef tartare- delicious!! Egg yolk mixed in with grade A beef ,perfect   Our friends ordered the 4 course summer prefixe meal and it looked like a great deal.    Overall if they lightened up on the butter, I would've given more stars.",

    "text": "Loved the feel of this restaurant.  Mom, brother, hubby and I came here for dinner one of the nights we were in Vegas, on advice from the chef at Other Mama.  Thankfully, reservations were not hard to make.  If you're familiar with Balthazar in NY, it reminded me very much of that restaurant.  It was busy/buzzing but not pretentious or snobby.  Our server was a rarity - a handsome, 50-something, funny/flirty French guy.  I wish we had him at all the French restaurants we've been to.  Even mom couldn't get over his looks lol.  Between him and the helpers, we wanted for nothing the entire evening. (Although he did try to make me feel bad about getting tap water for the table when I ordered sparkling for myself.)  To start, we went with the special bread and butter to which our server said he wanted our opinion on how it compared to the regular bread service.  The fancy butter was definitely more flavorful.  But both were delicious and we ate a buttload.  We also ordered the beef tartare and foie gras parfait.  Both also very delicious.  I'm a huge fan of both dishes in general and Bardot does them well.  We sure did layer on that foie gras parfait very thickly...yum!  Mom got the French onion soup and she loved it.  She shared a little but otherwise, went to town on the pastry crust and soup.  To be honest, at this point, we were feeling really full already (especially mom) but we still hand our entrees coming.  Mom and hubby both got the 14oz ribeye with fries.  I got the duroc pork chop to be different.  Mom's ribeye was pure decadence.  So much marbling and so well cooked to the medium rare we asked for.  Wow.  My pork chop was also very delicious though I should have gone with my instincts and asked for it to be done at medium instead of well done.  We were so stuff we had to skip dessert.  Our server understood completely.    Fantastic dinner, pristine service and wonderful time had by all.  Love it!",

    "text": "Just to be clear, the 2-star rating is associated to two separate visits to Bardot. The first time I dined at this restaurant was a 4 only due to long wait to order our first drinks. However, today, I would say it's more like a 1 star-rating. Although our waitress was very nice, she was nowhere to be found. We ordered our appetizer fairly quickly but waited about 30-40 minutes for it to come out. Our order for our entrees were taken after about 30 minutes of looking around for our waitress. We seemed to not be the only ones in search of her. Since we were already frustrated about the wait, my boyfriend cancelled the rest of our order and we left. The manager ended up comping our coffee and appetizer which was nice, but I would have rather paid for a nice meal and a good experience. My boyfriend tipped the waitress $20 anyway, so she made out either way!   I love the Hunter's waffle and the foie gras parfait, but I think it'll be a while before I decide to return to Bardot.",

The recommended drink with the signature \"B\" is called \"And God created woman\" it's gin based and has a flowery delicate taste. It was a well made drink, all of the components blended so well...I was in love! It's a good time to tell you I am not a gin drinker but even I recommend it. Next was our meals. I don't have a single bad thing to say. Everything was just so damn good. Our warm asparagus salad was a perfect starter. It was so simple but tasted like it was a complicated dish. Asparagus, prosciutto, egg, hollandaise, and black truffle. Delicious.  Next was my pork chop. It was melt-in-my-mouth delicious and it was Huge! It was so smokey and so tender. Yum yum! The mustard sauce on the side was a perfect companion to it too . Not overly mustardy. I'm not a big fan of mustard usually but I liked it!  I'd say this dinner was a great one. Loved everything about and I would recommend having dinner here.., check it out!",

If I go to a Chinese restaurant and see a bunch of old Asians eating there, I know the place is legit. Well, so is BARDOT Brasserie! Plus, you know Las Vegas has become a culinary destination when French people both work and vacation there. I was kinda surprised.  We had perfect Micheladas and split Lobster Benedict with a generous serving of Maine lobster on croissants smothered in what they called a sauce Bernaise, but it had a delicious pinch of nutmeg in it that suited the shellfish. Newburgh? We also had a frisee aux lardons salad. Otherwise the eggs came with no sides. It's a dish best split like we did, like vol au vent with bacon and salad. Exactly what you want for Christmas brunch. Skip the buffets and still get the good stuff.  Oh, and it really is The Best Butter in the World. It came with a warm demi baguette in a paper bag.",

My flat iron steak was THE saltiest piece of meat I've ever had in my life. I only ate half because I was starving. My wife tried a piece and could not believe I had eaten so much.   My sister in law didn't finish her rib eye for similar reasons and she's an Argentinian carnivore.   The steak tartare was probably the only decent dish.   If you feel like spending $300-400 on a completely subprime experience around your red meats, this is the place for you!  Our blonde server was nice and comped us a couple of desserts upon feedback of the main meal, but it really doesn't make up for paying $49-70 for disappointing steak dishes. I could have gone to SW or Prime for that pricing.",

First the decor and atmosphere are really lovely, walking that fine line between relaxed and upscale.  My absolute favorite item to order here is the steak tartate.  It's packed with flavor and served with salty thin chips that are a perfect compliment.  At brunch they have multiple eggs benedicts that are all served on these perfectly crunchy but pillowy croissants.  The oysters are fresh and phenomenal. They also have everlasting rose in both sparkling and regular that is a fun joy to add to the experience.  The service is always spectacular as well - friendly and prompt.  I highly recommend visiting Bardot when in Vegas at the Aria.",

We sat at the bar (hooks below the bar to hang your coat/purse) and had to wait a little before we could order since they start the HH exactly at 5pm and not a minute before.  The bartender was really good about letting my friend sample the different beers and cider on tap and we all wound up with the Ommegang Witte to start while waiting for 5pm.    Once we were able we ordered the duck wings, shrimp cocktail, bone marrow, fries, both tartes, and the macaroni au gratin to share.  The wings were a big hit and we wound up ordering more of those.  The tartes were also great; so simple but so delicious.  Neither of my friends wanted to try the bone marrow but that was alright because it was wonderful and I was happy to have its deliciousness all to myself.  The drink of the day was the Bee's Knees made with gin, honey syrup, and lemon and it also was delicious.  You may see a theme here.  The fries, macaroni, and shrimp cocktail were all good but nothing out of the ordinary taste wise.  The garlic mayo with the fries was really good, though.   Our bartender was friendly and the food came in good time frame.  We left full and little tipsy before 7pm and the bar was pretty full with the restaurant starting to get busy on this Saturday night.  Based on the Happy Hour, I definitely want to come down and give the regular menu a try.",

    "text": "The overall experience here was terrible, not because the food was horrible but that the service was atrocious.  Our waiter, Oscar, thought he was in France and was giving attitude like he was a Frenchman to an American tourist.  First off, Oscar just had mad attitude taking our order.  When we didn't order alcoholic drinks nor appetizers, he got all pissy.  We had a nice dinner planned at e by Jose Andres (that's a place you should def check out). that night so we wanted a light lunch.  Plus not everyone in Vegas is a degenerate that drinks and gambles at all hours...so what if we didn't order drinks.  When it's my turn to order, I see they have a french dip, which I usually really like.  I turn to him and start to order but I noted that the french dip is a chicken french dip.  I tell him to cross that off since it's not a traditional beef french dip.  He rolls his eyes impatiently.  I quickly switch my order to the French onion soup but I asked him about the option to add short rib, black truffle & a poached egg.  He says its a completely different soup.  So I ask his opinion about the soup and whether or not he likes it.  He replies \"if you need to ask its not for you\" and he just walks away.  WTF?!?!?!  Seriously?  He is in the service business and if he can't provide customer service go do something else.  Have you ever had a waiter just walk away from you in the middle of a discussion?  The food itself was average at best.  The pastry basket was bad as most of the pastries didn't look or taste fresh.  Do yourself a favor and go to Bouchon in the Venetian for pastries.  We just returned from SF were we had awesome KA's at b. patisserie and we also recently tried Dominique Ansel's new bakery in LA where he had the DKA's (his spin).   All of these places blow the pastry basket at Bardot out of the water.  I can't believe they even sell this stuff here.  A couple of us got the French onion soup, which wasn't bad but pretty average.  At least it wasn't overly salty like bad French onion soup.  My wife ordered the burger.  When it arrived it looked like a pretty average burger but she said it was awesome.  So of course I took a bite and I have to admit looks can be deceiving.  It was pretty damn good (and for $20+ it better be).  The meat, caramelized onions, and bread all went really well together.  Easily the best thing we ate there.  But I wouldn't go again for the burger (since the best of the food was average or below par at best) and the service probably one of the worst we've ever experienced (Recommendation to Oscar: if you want to be a waiter do it properly otherwise go do something else).  It's unfortunately because we were just in SF and had dinner at Michael Mina's flagship restaurant (named after himself) and it was an awesome experience from the service level to the food.  If only a small portion of that restaurant rubbed off on Bardot, the experience here would be significantly better.",

I had the beet salad. Was just okay. My husband had the pork chop and was not impressed.  Service was poor.  Our waiter good barely pay attention to us long enough for taking our order.  We were asked when making our reservation if we were celebrating anything. Said it was our Anniversary.  Was never acknowledged by anyone.  Lots of outstanding places to eat in Vegas. Stop here for happy hour and move on.",

Our servers were attentive and always filling our water glasses. Never rushed us even when we stayed an extra hour after our dinner was done. Filled our coffee cups twice. Didn't have an attitude when we each paid with credit cards. Food was beautifully presented. We ordered tons of appetizers and the 20 ounce steak to share. Two dozen oysters, foie gras served on a bed of lentils, King crab crepe, bone marrow, escargot on puff pastry(YUM), tuna tartare with quail egg, duck wings, side order of green beans and French onion soup. Super good. Dessert: cherry clafouti and Mille feuille",

    "text": "Party of 6 celebrating a birthday - I have to say that I have a hard time understanding the 5 star reviews for this place.  I would give this place a solid \"meh.\" With the high cost for a meal here comes the burden of expectation, and the group of us walked out thinking that the food was thoroughly mediocre overall, which is really what drove the rating down.  For easy reading, let me go point by point. Service - Service was excellent, an easy 5 star rating here.  Servers were friendly, attentive, and were understanding when we sent a cocktail back that we didnt care for. Atmosphere - Similarly excellent - 5 stars here again. Food - Here is where things start to go off the rails a bit.  To be clear, I'm not at all saying that anything we ate here was horrible/inedible.  Food simply didn't come close to expectations. Starters -  Starters were really the strong part of the mea. Endive Salad - 4 stars, not much to say here.  Fine, but otherwise unremarkable. Lobster Bisque - 5 stars. This has the distinction of being the best food items.  Super creamy and rich, the soup was excellent. Only 5 star rating we can give. Onion Soup -  4 stars, the soup was a little on the salty side, but was otherwise pretty good. Meals - And here comes the heart of it. Parisian Gnocchi - 3.5 stars - Two people at the table ordered this, and both came away with the same complaints - first, the gnocchi was not served hot, and second, there wasn't anything particularly remarkable about the flavor or presentation. Duck Breast - 2 stars - Real problems here.  First, and most importantly, the duck was significantly overcooked and underseasoned.  The breast was very rubbery/chewy and had cooled significantly at the time of serving, though several of us commented that the huckleberry jus was a nice touch.  Certainly can see how this dish could have been a real winner under different circumstances, but that was not our experience. Rack of Lamb - [my dish]3 stars - the good part - the lamb was cooked to an absolutely perfect medium rare, really nailed that part.  The problem was that it was severely under-seasoned, which is really a shame.  If properly seasoned, a little over/under on the cook would have been forgivable.  The veg and polenta were serviceable.  Overally, same thought as the previous - this could have been a home run under different circumstances. Really wish this had been a better experience - they do make really good cocktails, despite the comment about sending one back.  That was just a personal taste issue.   Highly unlikely to give this place another shot.",

We always eat family style, sharing dishes so we dan try more things. We started with the perfect tiny little escargo in puff pastry. I swear my wife could have died and gone yo heaven right then and there, except we were enjoing endless sparking French Rose wine way too much.  So we went on to the amaing buckwheat crepe with crab, and the one of a kind hunters waffle with duck confit and a sauce I cannot even describe it was so sumptious.  We also indulged, for $5, in the best French butter we have ever enjoyed, on crispy french baggette with sea salt we sprinkled on the buttered bread. OMG,  Perfect service, perfect food. Like everything in Vegas, it was an expensive brunch, but one we will never ever forget. We will return for dinner for certain.",

We started off ordering the King crab crepe and foie gras parfait for the appetizers. The king crab crepe was just so so.. flavor or texture did not impress me at all. The foie gras parfait spread was nice and creamy but the toast that came along with it was too thick and it made the whole appetizer unbalanced.  Starting with entrees, we ordered the heritage chicken roti and the loup de mer. The word for both of those dishes are bland and boring. Me and my best friend couldn't even finish our food.. and we usually finish our food!  So 2 star rating is for the service. Food gets 0.  Although food was not that great, I will come back and try the brunch menu. Hopefully, it will be a completely different experience.",

    "text": "Continuing our endless mission of finding cheese and charcuterie plates, we ended up at Bardot for a nice dinner.   From the start, the service was prompt, courteous, and friendly. Our server helped us narrow down our cheese selection and the sommelier was very knowledgeable. We live in wine country and wanted to venture out from the familiar California wines of Napa and Sonoma. We were looking for something oaky, buttery, and smooth...with a twist. The sommelier guided us to a nice bottle of 2012 Louis Jadot Meursault, a Chardonnay.   The wine was just what we were looking for.  It had a smooth buttery taste with a touch oak and a hint of mouthfeel.    Our cheese and charcuterie plates were excellent. The cheese selections were a tad small, but they tasted great.    The charcuterie plate was sized well and in both cases, the accompaniments provided fun additional flavors.   Our main dishes were a major let down. We had the salmon with lentils and gnocchi. The fish was cooked well, flakey with crispy skin, but was a touch heavy on the salt.  The lentils were too salty to eat. I liked the flavor profile they were going for but after two bites and a bitter face, I was done.   The gnocchi was also too salty.  Parmesan dishes are usually salty, but this was over the edge. On the plus side, the gnocchi was very tender. The asparagus was woody and stringy.   I debated to give this restaurant 3 or 4 stars.  The main dishes were some of the worst I've had at any of the nicer restaurants in Vegas, but the service was excellent and our appetizers were really good.  I would like to hope that my experience was an off night for the chef.  I decided on 3 because the main course should be the highlight of a meal, not the appetizer.",

Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Our server explained the process of them grinding to different types of meat together. Quite delicious without being overfilled from the bun. Of course paired with perfect fries that was so light and airy.  Their ham Benedict on croissants was a nice change to the traditional Benedict. Great sized portions to share.  Service was excellent, would highly recommend!",

They have an extensive wine list and let us try a sample before we made our selection. We decided on wonderful Vouvray. Service was impeccable. Our server was attentive but not overbearing.    For appetizers I tried the escargot which was different then how it's traditionally prepared. There are 6 that come on a wood plank served in a puff pastry topped with a pesto sauce. It was very flavorful. My date got the foie gras which was accompanied by a thick, crusty bread. Very tasty! For our main entrees we tried the lamb chops which were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We skipped on the coffee and dessert (although the creme brulee was tempting) as we were both full. Wonderful experience from start to finish!",

    "text": "My experience started out rough because of the service. My server was abrupt and impatient. I'm not sure if he heard me complain, but I noticed some improvement when he came back.  I thought he was racist because I noticed how charming he was with the Caucasians at the next table.  It's interesting that his recommendation changed from person to person. My friends who got there earlier asked for recommendations and he told them to get a set of items. Then when I asked, he told me another set of items.    I was at a French brasserie, so I had felt like I had to get the escargot. Not escargot in butter, but this puffed pastry escargot. Next he mentioned the lobster roll was unlike any other and I can't find it anywhere. He also recommended the Hunter's waffle. I wanted one croissant for $3 and he told me I might as well get the \"bread basket\" for $10.   I ordered pastis and the server had no idea what I was talking about. I told him, that this is a French restaurant and you must have Ricard at the bar. He checked and they brought me a glass of pastis on the rocks for $15. At that price, I should have instead ordered the $20 bottomless brunch rose.  Everything I ordered was excellent. My favorite was the bread basket, which is more of heaven in a basket. My first attack was the canele. I wasn't going to share that with anyone. I inhaled it. Next was the croissant which was crisp just like I've had in France. Then there was a kouign-amann and raisin pastry which I shared with my table.   This is a Michael Mina restaurant which I've had on my list of places to eat at Vegas and I'm glad I was able to check it out during this trip. Chef Joshua Smith is the chef de cuisine and is taking French classics to another level of refinement.   The management needs to better train the staff. I didn't feel the service level matched the restaurant quality. It did improve towards the end of my meal, but was not at all memorable.   The food outshined the service. 3 stars service. 5 stars for the elevated take on French classics.

    "text": "This should have been a much better experience then it was.   We were a party of 3 and went yesterday on a Saturday.  Since were were going to a show that night we opted to have a larger lunch so we would not be rushed at a restaurant trying to get to the theater on time.  I made a reservation for 1:30.  When our server came to the table with the menus she informed us that the kitchen closes at 1:30 and that we needed to get our orders in.  We started by splitting an order of steak tartare which was great.  But then my beet salad, which was to me my first course, showed up at the same time as my steak burger.  I think in America's would just call this a hamburger, I was expecting this to be more of a piece of steak in a roll.  I was unhappy that the kitchen slammed out all of our food at once so that they could close.  I discussed this with our server who told me she had no control over the kitchen so she sent the manager out to the table.  I ended up refusing the burger we finished, paid and left very unsatisfied.    Don't take a reservation at 1:30 when your intention is to close the kitchen at the same time.  If I knew this was the restaurant policy I would have made a reservation earlier.  If a restaurant seats a guest then the kitchen needs to be available while that guest is having their meal.  Otherwise how different is this from fast food which is the opposite of French cuisine.",

This is a pricy option for a late dinner in the Aria area without having to eat at the Aria cafe (slightly less slow) downstairs. However, despite the slow service we received on the Thursday night before EDC, the food and dranks really wow'd us. My fiance started the evening with a drink I've only been able to jot down as the \"Blood and Sand Scotch drink\". It was orangey and smooth and finished in a few minutes.   The beef tartare was a delicious starter. The chips that came with it were super yummy and I was a bit sad we didn't ask for more chips. No matter. I had the pork chop for dinner which was smokey and thick and a lot of meat to put in my mouth. The horseradish mashed potatoes that came with my dish was buttery and creamy and soooo good. My fiance had the flat iron steak which also had a smokiness to it and was nice and tender.   For a not very busy part of the night, it was difficult flagging down a server for water and drank refills, so I think the wait staff could put in a little more effort in being attentive. However, the servers (especially the one who recommended dranks) were very friendly when they were able to stop by. Definitely on the pricy side, so I'm not sure when I'll come back. Maybe when I win the jackpot on the Willy Wonka slot machine.",

Small table squeezed between other seated tables in small area of the room, while half the room was empty until we left. I think they could've at least spread the customers/parties farther away from each other until more customers arrive. I saw another customer complaining about the same issue in a previous Yelp review, but looks like this restaurant doesn't learn or doesn't care much about customer experience. The table also felt too small for 4 people. 2. Very long wait for the soup before the entree and no waitress around, until we had to ask the water server if we could get the soup soon. 3. I ordered medium-rare wagyu steak, but gotten one of the rarest/uncooked steaks I've ever eaten. I felt like I'm eating raw cow. Also, I didn't see much marbling in the meat, associated with wagyu beef. Although there was some nice crust on the outside that tasted really good, and whatever I could eat was good. I could only imagine that the steak could be really good if cooked a little better. 4. The waitress recommended mac-n-cheese as a side dish, which looked interesting, but tasted ordinary and somewhat too cheesy. At least they should've recommend a better side dish, unless they don't serve anything better... 5. The waitress asked if we like the food and need anything before we started eating, but later never came back to follow up when we actually needed her. We haven't seen her again until finishing the meal. Although this could be the restaurant's fault, as the waitress seemed to be serving a lot of tables, possibly around 10. Although it shouldn't take too much time for her to ask couple more times if we need anything else. 6. The waitress looked and acted like someone who should be cleaning tables at a buffet, without even basic education or food serving skills. She made the whole place feel like a low end country diner. Do they just hire anyone from the street to wait tables here? 7. Overall the rest of the food was good, but the sides somewhat ordinary. Ordinary fries, ordinary tasting mac-n-cheese, ordinary onion soup, undercooked steak. We wanted to be just a little impressed with something. 8. We waited long time for a dessert menu, after finishing the food. It was so long that we've decided to go somewhere else for dessert. While every restaurant should know that the most important time to serve customers is when they arrive, and when they are finishing eating. How can you even run a restaurant not understanding such basics, or not training your staff? 9. A manager came to check on us when finishing our dinner, but it was too late to complain about food, while it didn't feel appropriate to ask him for dessert menu. I also wanted to gather my thoughts to write some notes for this review. Though maybe we should've talked to him. 10. Our bill was $280 and felt overpriced considering the above (we didn't order drinks except couple bottles of water).  We were initially excited and looking forward to visiting this place, but left quite disappointed. We are a family of 4 and initially each of us rated the place between 2 and 4, but agreed on 2 after discussing the above issues. We visited Jan 4 2018 for dinner (6pm).",

    "text": "I truly wish I could give half stars sometimes. This restaurant really did come in between a 3 and a 4 for me. I went here during a work conference trip with some coworkers when we were trying to escape yet another vendor dinner. The decor is absolutely beautiful and definitely makes you feel like you are in the Aria. It's very French classic. That part of it I will say, was a five star.   For food, I started with the onion soup (as did all three of my coworkers) and it was phenomenal! It was the biggest bowl of onion soup I have ever had in my life and quite possibly the tastiest. There was a ton of bread, a ton of onions, and a ton of cheese - it was everything French onion soup should be. Quite honestly, you can eat this as your meal, it was that much food. Because I had this rich soup, I decided to do a lighter dinner and had the mussels. The mussels were definitely prepared well, they had no grit or sand and they were all steamed open - for me, the miss here was simply the flavor. I also tried my coworkers gnocchi which was heavenly but a very heavy dish as well. I mean for crying out loud this is French food so richness, I guess is something that should be expected.  The service was lackluster and our server was not knowledgeable which for a restaurant of this caliber was extremely disappointing and definitely tainted the experience.  All things considered, this was a very nice restaurant and I would certainly go back to have some french onion soup if nothing else.",

We were seated right away.  We ordered the Paris ham croissant benedict ($16), the french toast ($16), the hunter's waffle ($19) and a nutella sticky bun for the table ($16). While we waited, they brought a couple of small baguettes for the table and some yummy salted whipped butter.   The food was all amazing. The french toast was HUGE!!! Waaaaay too much for one person and a little too rich. I felt like I would have had a sugar coma after consuming it. The hunter's waffle looked good. My brother-in-law seemed to be enjoying it. The croissant benedict was as delicious as it sounded. What better to have as the base for an eggs benedict than a flakey buttery croissant? It was soooooo good!   The clear winner for the brunch was the nutella sticky bun. It was melt in your mouth, sticky, gooey, goodness. I'm glad we got one to split for the table though, because just having that for breakfast is pretty dangerous.   This place was so good we wanted an encore performance the next day, but sadly, they do not serve brunch on weekdays =(  It's a little pricey, but well worth the splurge!",

What doesn't need to happen is a CHAUVINIST SUPERVISOR WORKING IN VEGAS at the 21st century. RAYMOND came to apologize on behalf of the BARDOT Brasserie, my friend and I were sitting at the bar, I had the soup and I'm also a female, Raymond came to us introduce himself to my friend (the male) shook his hand and then waved at me, I guess to acknowledge my existence and then apologized to my friend (the male) for the soup he never ate, didn't give me a second look and left.  I was and still am furious, by the way I'm not insecure, I am not a weak woman and I don't consider myself an active feminist but to be treated like I'm a piece of something sitting next to a male by a restaurant's CHAUVINIST SUPERVISOR after I choose to spend my money there (yes, believe it or not I pay for my share) is unacceptable.  As for the rest, most food was ok, Steak Tartare and Foie Gras Parfait were really good and Jason's service at the bar that was impeccable, if not for that encounter with that idiot (accuse my language) I would probably agree with the 4 stars review but I did meet that supervisor and I'm still furious, they don't deserve our money especially when there are so many other options, maybe even owned by women, here's an idea for you.",

The Cod and the Gnocchi were disappointing. Foie Gras was so good I would go back just to eat that. I had $100 Aria resort credit that I needed to use and got to use it for this place. I would check your bill if you are charging to your room. My credit didn't apply to this restaurant for some reason. I had to call Aria to get it adjusted.  I think next time I would try the steak and fries. Those looked amazing as it was being brought to other tables. The service was also extremely slow at the bar area. Waited 50 minutes for our main entrees to arrive. That's ridiculous. The other tables that got there later got their food ahead so they probably forgot about us. No apologies either from the waitress.",

I ordered the foie gras with a glass of the Bartender's Choice as my happy hour cocktail, which happened to be on this day a smooth and simple concoction of tequila with a splash of lime. Eric, the bartender who served me, was very professional and pleasant. The foie gras was delicious. It was served with thick, fresh from the oven bread. It was a perfectly smooth texture. This particular foie gras is served with ruby port gelee, so if you like it without the sweetness of the \"jam\" you may want to let the server/bar staff know so they can accommodate you. I finished my happy hour with a slice of lemon meringue tarte. I don't like my desserts too sweet and this one was a smidgen on the sweet side, but the right amount of lemon flavor was the redeeming quality.  It was a nice happy hour for a last night in Vegas. I'll go back for a proper lunch or dinner since my experience was a positive one.",

The French onion soup was rather good as well, and I really, absolutely loved the Rack of Lamb. All of the food was really good.   Our wait staff was definitely good to go.

The base is a croissant instead of an english muffin, it was fluffy and buttery, so good! The rib melted in my mouth, the spinach was good, everything was good! The escargot bardot was on point! Strong flavor with puffy pastry on the outside, very good appetizer!",

    "text": "I was underwhelmed.   The overall ambiance was nice. Clean and classic without being overly fancy. That being said, I felt that the food was priced higher than it should have been. I understand it cost more to eat better quality, but this just didn't meet the standard I was expecting for the price point. The service was ok, but it took a really long time for our order to come out. 30 - 45 min. Bubs ordered the crab crepe ($22). He liked it but I was not a fan at all. I ordered the beet salad. Flavors were on point with what I expected, but there really wasn't much food. When I order a salad I imagine a plate with lettuce and fixings. This was a cut up beet with a goat cheese wheel and some arrugala laid on top. Not really worth $19. The best part were the truffle fries. Cooked and seasoned to perfection, they were the saving grace of the meal. My friends ordered the pork chop and the lobster bisque. Both said their food was ok. For the damage it put on my credit card, I was expecting more.",

I would definitely come back for the French Toast..It was HEAVENLY. So moist, soft, fluffy, but crispy on the outside. Not sweet at all. Syrup is served on the side.   Make sure to order the French bread that comes with \"the worlds best butter\" ... it really is the worlds best butter... sooo rich in flavour but not too heavy or thick. So soft and silky with a creamy buttery salt flavour. The French bread is also very fresh and served warm",

The pastrami cured salmon was fabulous. It looked incredible, with so much attention to detail.  The taste did not disappoint. The French onion soup was very good as were the short rib bourguignon eggs Benedict. Make a reservation to assure a nice table.",

The hostess and the waiter both apologised and we hung out at the bar so it wasn't too bad.   In terms of food, it was decent but again nothing memorable. We picked this place cuz we stayed at the Aria and they can accommodate a big group.  The complimentary French bread that came with the meal was great and we ordered their \"world best butter\" for $8 a pop. The butter was very silly and creamy but we didn't think it lived up to its name. We thought the complimentary butter was just as good.   Overall, food was decent but again, Vegas has a lot Of great restaurants to offer so I probably won't come back anytime soon.",

On our very first date, my husband took me to a French restaurant. We re-created that first date by coming here. We had reservations for 630 and was seated promptly in a nice booth that was actually for a party of four. I really liked this extra touch. Our waitress Kim was really good and personable. She checked in with us multiple times but not excessively.   Came with a complimentary bread and butter.   10 OZ FLAT IRON, STRAUSS GRASS-FED - you get to pick your sauce. The steak was cooked to perfection and the fries that came with it was amazing!   PARISIAN GNOCCHI - I got this and was very pleased. I got a gnocchi dish on our first date too. This is way better. It was very pleasing to the eyes and the gnocchi was the best we've had. Doesn't look like a lot of food but you will be full.   BRUSSELS SPROUTS - sides. A good amount that can be shared up to three people.   We also got a wine and a cocktail (STRAWBERRY BLANC). The strawberry blanc was really good and refreshing.   Overall, it was a great experience EXCEPT how there is some lady who takes photos of you and tries to get you to spend $70 bucks on three printed photos. I understand we are in Vegas and in the Aria but this is a nice place. I don't want to be coerced into buying photos like I am in an amusement park. Hence 4 stars instead of 5.",

Brunching here is a great way to ease into a weekend day, starting with the bottomless rose. More, please! And the food options are all quite solid. I didn't partake in the much-enjoyed Nutella sticky bun for fear of an instant heart attack, but I still pushed the envelope with the foie gras tartare and a side of bacon to start. It was quite delightful, with none of the \"ducky\" taste in the way that, say, seafood can taste \"fishy.\" The short rib bourgignon benedict added more savory tastiness to the whole brunch.   Service is friendly and professional, and also just the right level of attentive without being overbearing. The venue, which is up a flight of escalators from the ground floor of the Aria, indeed feels like an authentic Parisian bistro with its rustic decor.",

When you receive impeccable service with incredible food, I'll be back for more.  Our dining excursion led us to sample several hors d'oeuvres as well as desserts.  Let's start with the hors d'oeuvres.  The Prime Steak Tartare is ground to order and served with a sauce verte, egg yolk on top with gaufrette potatoes.  The steak tartare is presented beautifully.  When you break the yolk to ooze into the tartare, it's perfect.  The Onion Soup Gratinee couldn't be better with the cave-aged gruyere covering the dish.  The winner of our starters for me is the King Crab Crepe.  Perfectly delicate with black trumpet mushrooms, sunny side egg. The normandy cider beurre blanc on the side could've been smothered on everything I ate.  I fell in love with this sauce.    Onto the fun stuff, Dessert.  We probably went overboard but we that's our thing.  We split 3... yes 3.  The Mille Feuille, Apple tart and Cherry Clafouti.  All had an intense and rich flavor.  Each had their own unique characteristic.  What stood out was the Cherry Clafouti.  It's warm cherry pudding with pistachio ice cream on top.  The cherry pudding was more like a cherry bread pudding.  Very sweet and savory.  The pistachio ice cream complimented the dessert so perfectly.    I wish I had our waitresses name since she was so attentive.  She was great with recommendations and accommodating to our needs.  Her service was the cherry on top to a 5 star experience.",

    "text": "Thank you BARDOT for such an amazing dining experience. You definitely helped make my birthday a memorable one!  I had been wanting to come here for a while, and my bf actually made reservations for us to eat here on my birthday. Everyone was extremely friendly and even wished me a happy birthday. We both had And God Created Woman, which I believe is named after the 50's French film. It was delicious. Just slightly sweet with citrus flavors that went well with the gin. Our server described it perfectly especially with the foam on top. We decided to start off our dinner with a cheese plate and oysters. The oysters were delicious and refreshing and the cheese plate, absolute perfection. We got the Blue cheese, goat cheese and the monks cheese. All of which were delicious!  We then ordered the caramelized goat cheese and beet salad, as well as the French onion soup. My bf wasn't too fond of the beet salad for the specific reason that he isn't too fond of beets (he ordered the salad), I thought it was delicious. I on the other hand bought the onion soup was good, but I felt like the cheese didn't melt properly.   For our main entrees, my bf got the pork chop, and I the gnocchi. The pork chop was supposedly fantastic, as he described it as really smoky bacon and enjoyed every bite. The gnocchi is not going to be what you expect. It is a very creamy dish with the triple creme wedges, butter soft, and very large gnocchi's. I personally thought it was a little too hearty for me, but it was still delicious  Dessert was finished nicely as my bf surprised me with a macaron with \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate. The portions here are quite large for a French restaurant, and you definitely feel like you got the most of your meal. The staff is very friendly, I would recommend coming here at least once if you are able to",

The classy decor, style and overall vibe of the place is definitely one with a throwback feel. Upon entering we were immediately greeted and seated right away.  The waiter quickly took and brought our drinks and informed us of the night's specials. I tried to convince the table to order the Duck wings a L'Oreal but we ended up ordering the bone marrow and charcuterie board. The board was good but nothing too exciting but the bone marrow was simply devine and easily the best I've ever ordered at any steak house.  We ended up ordering the code which was on special and the double pork chop. Our friends both got steaks. They have a good selection of beers on tap and the service and ambience is second to none. We hope to be back soon. This is a great place to treat yourself when in Las Vegas",

    "text": "Take. Me. Back.  I have little to no faith in Mina restaurants but this place blew me away. I come to Vegas enough to constantly struggling to try a new place vs visiting an old spot. Finally stayed away from grabbing brunch at Bouchon and ended up here. Located on the second floor, escalator near the taxi drop off. If you're coming from the casino floor, head over to the chocolate decor wall and you'll see the escalator.  The decor of this place is great. I feel like I'm in some 1950 building. Service was great, I forgot his name, but the server we had was very patient with us. He gave a good amount of suggestions, just that we didn't have the stomach to try everything. Ended up ordering the escargots bardot, short rib croissant benedict, and a bellini. Bellini was good, but I just felt like one that day, it's not a MUST HAVE. But the other two.... if you're able to take the disgusting thought of having to engulf a snail down your throat, order it. If you're not afraid of a heavy brunch dish, order that short rib croissant benedict. What this place has done right is the pastry. Both the bardot and the benedict had a good flakey crisp. If I didn't have to share the bardot, that would have been better. Unfortunately I came with 2 others and it was our first time, so sharing is caring. Blah blah blah. I was deciding between the short rib croissant benedict and the hunter's waffle (duck confit waffle, basically a more bougie version of chicken and waffles, I'm bougie so I considered it). I'm too much of a croissant fan so the benedict won me over. Not that it was a bad dish, it was just too heavy for my preference. I loved it, but I didn't want to be THAT full. Hunter's waffle would have left me in the same state. Flavors had been very rich, lots of juice coming from the short rib. Paired with the yolk, there goes the crispy and flakey croissant...   But yes. Make me go back there, because I can't say no.",

    "text": "First thing first, you pay a premium for food & drinks on the strip, so the price here is inline with that.  We made a reservation at 6:30 on a Tuesday and we got seated right away when we arrived. It was half empty at that time, the waiter was friendly and explained the menu to us very well. The decor was great, looks just like a restaurant in French, unfortunately the noise level was unmistakably Vegas, it was definitely one of the nosiest restaurants we've visited including buffets and fast food.  We almost had to shout in order to hear one another.  I wonder if it was because there's a conversation crowd dining there. We ordered the octopus as appetizer and the beet salad, I had the scallops and my husband had the prime rib, we also had the Baked Alaska as dessert.  The dessert was the best value considered you got a show out of it, although the taste was just OK.  We like the rest of the food, it's good but not exceptional. The service was good overall, our waiter was attentive at first, but when the restaurant fills up, he was busy serving others, we had to wait for about 10 minutes after we finished our entrees for someone (whom looked like a hostess) to clear our plates and gave us the dessert menu.   Since there's tons of restaurants to choose from in Vegas, I don't think I'll come back just because of the noise level.",

    "text": "We are already big Michael Mina fans, so needless to say, we really enjoyed Bardot. Started with escargot Bardot (escargot in puff pastry), foie gras parfait, and the steak tartar. The fois gras parfait was amazing - whipped with a thin layer of port gelee on top. Our server described it as \"adult PB&J.\" The steak tartar has a very delicate flavor, so start with that first if you're going to have it because it didn't quite stand up to the other appetizers.   For mains, my friend ordered the Parisian gnocchi and it was excellent. I had the pork chop (it was huge and saltier with the bacon). Came with delicious horseradish mashed potatoes. My husband had a steak, which he enjoyed. The wine service was very nice - the server came with 3 recommended wines (one for each of us) and he poured us samples. The only downside was that we were completely unaware of the price (he quoted one glass at $18 and it was actually $25).   For dessert, don't miss the chocolate macaroon. It's big enough to share.  It was a bit pricey, but I'm told their brunch is a steal with bottomless rose. We will certainly be back!",

My wife's drink (I can't remember all the great things she added but egg whites was one!) was exactly what she wanted. Lillian's first attempt was not satisfactory to her so she just threw it out. Sit in bar area and watch her work. Talk to her and you will get a perfect drink.",

Comfortable elegance with class--nothing like feeling like you're in a stuffy library that you can't talk.The staff are so inviting and helpful with your selections. We loved the Foie Gras parfait with grilled country bread! They even brought more bread. It's the type of appetizer that would make you act naughty, like licking your fingers. The escargot bardot took awhile to come out but, I did wish that I could taste the escargot more than the pastry. However, it was warm and delicate. The Skate wing was good. But, the main star was the Oak fired pork chop! The smoke on the pork chip was amazing. We can't wait to go back and try their other selections.",

Our waitress was a nice pregnant girl, and have only little complaints about her.  She was quiet, so quiet I could barely hear her over the incredible noise. We did tapas, ordering 8 appetizers. Shrimp cocktail was perfectly cooked and tender. The cheese plate was delicious. The meat plate, half yummy half flavorless.  The duck lorange was not to my taste, though others said it was just ok. The pigs ear turned my stomach, but I had a small price that was totally fat, the men ate the rest. My sister spit her piece out. The seared foie gras was yummy, the parfait foie gras was delicious! King crab crepe was yummy!  The worst part the bread was burnt, ard and inedible. Which made it hard to eat most of the appetizers, as most required some sort of delivery device.  All the desserts were amazing The manager came over and spoke to us, and apologized, though didn't offer any discount or compensation. So don't expect any thing more than \" I'm sorry, you didn't enjoy the meal.\" Which is fine, we didn't need a discount or freebies. But with the amount of food sent back it would have been nice. And it would have been nice of the waitress was a little more attentive.",

The hostess came by to grab us when our table was ready and almost immediately our server arrived with a bottle of water. We opted for the Summer in Provence tasting menu and the wine pairings. We both selected the tuna tartare, the scallops, sea bass, and strawberry pavlova. The alcohol pairings allowed for either a wine with each course of cocktail/beer. Our server was incredibly accommodating and said it would be no problem if I wanted to try the cocktail with my first course since I really wanted to try \"And God Made Woman.\"   First, the food was amazing. The portions were good and the wine with each course was delicious. And damn if that \"And God Made Woman\" cocktail wasn't worth asking the server for a sub. Seriously, get a glass, it's awesome.   Having never had strawberry pavlova, I was super surprised by the presentation and now I'm going to research how to make it at home because it was just that good.  Hands down one of the most expensive meals we've ever had, but we both agreed we'd come back. I mean, I don't know what else to say, it's just really good. Also, say yes to the bread when they ask.",

Have been 3x: twice during dinner and once during rose brunch - where the servers NEVER let my glass become under half full with rose!!! Same applies to my water glass! The service was supreme. The side of hash browns is delicious and so was the french toast that we all shared (several portions). There is a slight dress code for gentlemen so check on that - we came to booze it up right before Life is Beautiful festival so had to tell the guys no festival wear until after rose brunch ;)",

We asked if we could be seated in the main restaurant and were told there were no tables available. Perhaps we should have been told this when the reservation was made? We ordered cocktails and it took 45 minutes just to get our drinks. The waitress kept apologizing that the bar was backed up. Honestly-45 minutes to get drinks?? By the time our drinks came, we finished our appetizers and were ready for our main meal. The manager did comp our drinks but it did not make up for the long wait time. The food was well prepared and very tasty but overall this was not a great experience. There are too many excellent restaurants in Vegas where they appreciate your patronage. I would not recommend spending your money here.",

    "text": "A beautifully decorated room. Warm colors & festive, instantly transporting you to  Paris, France.  My friends & I were escorted to a nice comfortable room with a big 4 top table. Thank goodness it wasn't a little table!  That part of a Paris Brasserie was left out of our experience.  Our first course was the Pate de Champagne, Foie Gras Parfait, & Fruits de Mer. LOVED the Pate de Champagne with the port wine gelee. The perfect combo of sweet & salty. I couldn't get enough of the melt in your mouth love. The Foie Gras Parfait had a textbook European Foie Gras  texture I liked it but I do prefer the Pate creaminess. My friends who are from Europe absolutely loved it. The cornichons that acompanied the Foie Gras balanced the dish with it's salty sour flavor. And of course the Fruits de Mer was lovely in presentation as well as taste. My taste buds were soooo happy! Our mains were Lobster Thermador & Rack of Lamb. The presentation of the Lobster Thermador was beautiful. 2 huge pieces of Lobster (shared by 2) topped with Brandy cream Bernaise. The Bernaise sauce was whipped to look like a cloud of French heaven. It was lovingly baked on the  Lobster. I was sad that I didn't order that till my Lamb Crown Roast was put before me.  Lamb was done perfectly. It was juicy & spiced just right. It was supposed to be for 2 people but the portion was so huge 3 could've been very satisfied with this delectable entree. I was suprised at the vegetable that  accompanied my Lamb. I thought that I hated Eggplant. The Chef & his staff proved me wrong. It was a puree of Eggplant topped with pesto sauce. It was such an amazing balance of flavors, salty & sweet. We also had mushrooms a la grecque & green beans almondine. The mushrooms were soooo delicious I really wished I didn't have to share that dish. It was heavenly & melted in my mouth. Not that they were mushy, but so perfectly cooked. Sadly the green beans were overly salted. So mush that no one ate much of it.  The last course was our 2 desserts. Coupe de Glacee which was the sorbet of the day, Strawberry topped with merengue. You would think eh, sorbet, so pedestrian. But this presentation was amazing! It was so unusual I actually took a picture of it. I'm not one of those camera foodies, but this desert looked so good. The merengue topping looked like little clouds of heaven. Not overly sweet, perfectly crunchy & yummy. The sorbet under the merengue had little bits of strawberry whipped into it. Aria has perfected the sorbet, what else can I say. We also had the classic Creme Caramel topped with a spun sugar cookie. It was also quite delicate & great with our after dinner espressos.   The service was exceptional. The Bardot staff was so attentive, patiently explaining our questions. I really appreciate good service which in my town is sadly lacking at most strip venues. These professionals were at the top of their craft. Cudos to them!  I was so happy that I took my friends to this restaurant. It's a gamble to go to a restaurant in the first weeks of a grand opening. A lot can go wrong as the staff is still working out the kinks. Evidently these people are the creme de la creme of fine dining. The food & service was superb! Bravo & Bon Apetit!!",

Some delicious traditional French dishes alongside some fun interesting take on the classics. Start by sharing the prime steak tartare and frisee aux lardons. I'm a big fan of simple dishes that are seasoned and executed well. Both of these dishes are just that. Their variations on Benedicts are deliciously fun but my favorite dish is the hunter's waffle -- a sort of duck a l'orange for breakfast. Sitting atop a waffle is glazed duck confit and perfectly poached eggs that are smothered with sauce maltaise. It's sweet and savory and makes me smile. And don't forget the everlasting rose. Service is absolutely always on point whether it's at the bar or at a table. Support staff is always helpful. Managers actively on the floor visiting with guests. It is pricey but absolutely worth every penny. Awesome awesome food, service and environment.",

Bardot is sexy, chic with an easy sophistication. My senses were quickly stimulated and I quickly was enraptured in a laissez-faire attitude while thinking of what cocktail to have.  In my group, I had (forgive me for not having the exact names) Salmon with Beluga Lentils, started with an Endive Salad, and Lemon Meringue Tart for dessert. Salmon was robust and rich, and the Endive Salad balanced the strong flavors of the bleu cheese and endive perfectly in it's vinaigrette.  But that Lemon Meringue Tart? I'm still dreaming of it. It was THAT good.  If they offer you bread and butter here, definitely get it. That baguette is served perfectly warm and that butter is creamy.  Michael Mina isn't that everyday occasion, but I'll definitely find a reason to come back here!  The only disappointment was having a few glasses of rose and not finding a photo of Brigitte anywhere!

We paid a little extra to separate the waffle from the duck and eggs and get whipped cream and strawberries instead.  The strawberries were the sweetest I've ever tasted.  How they got them to the desert, I don't know.   The bread and butter also deserve their own shout-out.  I basically filled up half my stomach space on those alone.",

He personally told me to relax when I asked if he could bring me ketchup when he had a chance. The food was average, but after this experience you couldn't pay me to go back. This is my first time writing a negative review on yelp. I am not one to complain but I felt this was necessary. My friend spoke to the manager about the poor and undeserved service we had, yet we had nothing taken off our bill. In all, terrible horrible, experience.",

    "text": "5 stars all the way for Bardot! It's one of the best French places I've been to!  + Escargot. 6 individual puff pastures ($18). Each one is packed with butter/garlic flavor! I'm not sure how they did this and still in awe about it because escargot is typically doused in butter and garlic but instead, the butter and garlic flavors are all embedded into the puff pastry. When you take a bite into the puff pastry he the escargot itself is actually pretty hot but the outside (the puff pastry) is warm.  + Smoked Salmon Croissant Benedict (FTW!). I am SO GLAD I went with this because I was debating between this and the lobster option. I love salmon but was told both were equally as good, just depends on what you're craving. The smoked salmon, hollandaise and croissant are all buttery goodness! They all pair so well together and the quality of the smoked salmon is like nothing I've ever had! The croissant isn't your typical croissant, but made to compliment the fillings (i.e. Egg, kale and of course salmon in this case).  The coffee is good too! I tried a few other things but can't remember since it's been some time since my visit - BUT - the quality of food here is amazing for the price! Service was attentive and on point. They have officially become my new favorite French restaurant!",

So why only 4 stars? actually I would give 4.5 if YELP! gave half stars....the noise level is EXTREMELY high. Now that means people have having a good time, which is OK with me, however just be prepared. I was there with a old friend just catching up and were @ a 2 top and a couple times we did say to each other, \"What?\"   The menu is diverse enough that everyone should be able to find a delish choice for appetizers, dinner & dessert. All our selections were very inviting to look at and MOST OF ALL tasted as good as they looked~ We both thought the price point was fare (again your on the Strip!)     The Bar area was hopping too, something was going on as many, many people were in costume through out the hotel.   Bardot Brasserie is inside the Aria, have to walk a ways one inside the Aria, but this is Las Vegas so that's nothing new.",

I don't know if I can give an honest review though without mentioning that I may have gotten really terrible food poisoning from here that night. It started a few hours after I ate here, and my husband met someone in the casino whose wife got food poisoning from BarMasa the same night. There might've been something just going around Aria. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4.  Aside from possible food poisoning, the food was fantastic. We shared onion soup, escargots, steak tartare, and the charcuterie board. The steak tartare entree was so good, we actually ordered an extra appetizer sized one. We also shared the chocolate macaron dessert, which was great but a little too rich. The only thing I ate that my husband didn't was complimentary macarons at the end of the meal. The other negative was service. We went on Valentine's Day, so we expected rushed service, but we were there early with few other diners and still felt like we barely saw or heard from our waiter.",

    "text": "The best brunch in Las Vegas.    That sounds like hyperbole, since Vegas is a city overrun with brunch spots at all price points and levels of quality.  But Michael Mina's Bardot Brasserie is the real deal.  It forgoes behemoth pancakes and bottom-shelf mimosas for top-quality French gastronomy, and the payoff is amazing.  Another plus: Bardot Brasserie is one of the few brunch spots that accepts reservations, which we were lucky to have when I joined 2 friends here for a 10am Sunday brunch.  The place was totally packed.  The hostess then whisked us past gorgeous displays of breads and pastries to a beautiful table near the back, which was an excellent vantagepoint to soak in the classy decor.  We started off with a round of cappuccinos, followed by \"la boulangerie\" -- an assortment of breads and pastries, along with baguettes and butter.  Absolutely everything was fresh, warm, and packed with flavor.  I would've been happy camper calling it a day after that, but we were hungry, so we kept ordering.  For the mains, we shared a plate of \"pate de campagne\" of pork, veal and pistachio, served with pickled vegetables, more crusty baguette, and spicy mustard.  The next course was the hunter's waffle with duck confit, poached eggs, and maltaise sauce.  Both of these were outstanding, but the hunter's waffle was truly exceptional -- an elevated and elegant twist on eggs benedict.  Somewhere in the middle of the mains, we had a bottle of \"Patrick Bottex Bugey Cerdon\" rose, which was a delicate and smooth bubbly that paired excellently with the duck.  (Speaking of which -- service was outstanding.  Our server knew the menu inside and out, and exactly what bottle to pair with what dish.)  To round out the meal, we tasted three different desserts -- chocolate macaron, apple tarte tatin, and orange jelly candy.  All of these were pure heaven, but special props go to that chocolate macaron.   Now I know why it's one of the signature dishes of the house.  The chocolate cookie combined with the dark chocolate mousse is just pure decadence.  I can't say enough good things about Bardot Brasserie.  I hope this place keeps Vegas classy -- and my belly full -- for a long time to come.",

Every staff member we met was friendly, helpful, and professional; I was pleasantly surprised. Our waiters knew their menu very well and gave us great suggestions for our orders. Water and coffee was always refilled with the attentive staff.  Fois Gra Parfait: bold in flavor, no fillers, just fois gras and ruby port gelee. Grilled country bread and mini pickles on the side. It seemed small at first, but then we realized how rich, dense, and flavorful it was and we ended up having leftover. Definitely worth a try.   Short-rib Croissant Benedict: RICH, delicious, savory. I don't know if I'd order this again, but I only regret my stomach wasn't big enough for this to fit comfortably.  French toast with mascapone, almond brittle, and almond syrup: huge, perfectly balanced in sweetness and textures. This is definitely large enough for 2 people to share.  Food was generously portioned, ambiance was Parisian-elegant/chic, and the staff was fantastic. I will definitely be visiting Bardot again for brunch next time I'm in town.",

The experience from the moment you walk up is absolutely phenomenal in every aspect. The look, the feel, the service, THE FOOD- it is worth every single penny. Is it noisy? Yes. Is it pricey? Yes. But if you're coming to Vegas for a quiet romantic getaway and expect a 5 star meal for under $50 you're vacationing at the wrong destination. The escargot is wrapped in a puff pasty and I could have ordered that alone and left and still be 100% satisfied with my visit. That is a MUST even if you don't normally enjoy escargot. However, we did order plenty more and every single course got better and better. We paired each course with a drink the server (Carlos?) and bartender (Dino) recommended (and a few more) and WOW, the presentation with the drinks themselves were astounding. After the escargot, Brussel sprouts, mussels, flat iron grass fed steak, and scallops it was time for the table side flambe baked alaska! Every single item was impeccable. I can not recommend Bardot enough! Thank you to everyone that assisted us with our experience!",

We had made the *mistake* of eating at Wicked Spoon for brunch earlier in the day, so we didn't get to try as many menu items at Bardot as we wanted to (glutton problems). We ordered cocktails to start, the Crowd Pleaser for him and Death in the Florida Straights for me. Both were excellent, I wanted to order 5 more of mine, because the spiciness was divine, but we had a show later I needed to be awake for.   We skipped appetizers, and he got the Heritage Chicken Roti and I had the filet mignon with steak frites. Ooooh man. My steak was a perfect rare, and so juicy tender perfect. The fries are cooked in beef fat and are pure decadence with mayonnaise. My husband was in love with his chicken, and we heard our waiter tell another table they were out of it as we were eating, so try not to miss it!   The restaurant itself is gorgeously decorated, and while we were sitting at a center table, it still felt quite intimate and romantic. Our waiter was great, and struck the perfect balance of attentive and unobtrusive.   By this point we were stuffed, which was a heartbreak, because I wanted to try their entire dessert menu. Truly, though, it gives us an excuse to come back on our next visit-- not that we really needed one.",

However I would never recommend or step a foot back into this place. When we got seated nobody came up to our table or bring us menus until my husband asked for menus. When we finally ordered the food and drinks it took a while for everything to come out. I ordered the duck waffles, half way through one, on my last bite I felt something sharp in my mouth I took it out to only notice it was a thick piece of plastic that could of cut my throat had I swallowed it by accident and possible damage my organs. I asked for a manager right away and he did apologize and comp our meal, however this is still a huge liability and reputation risk for such a high end and not cheap restaurant. People's safety should always come first and this fell very short of it. They need to be held to higher standards of performing quality assurance in the kitchen if a piece of plastic from some packaging is getting into the food.",

It starts with the kitchen team and extends to the front of the house. If you're price cautious you can absolutely navigate the menu to keep it reasonable and if not, then you can live decadently with the handful of more extravagant dishes.   Stand outs included the escargot (best I ever had), foie gras parfait, the seasonal specials (a salad and a ravioli-type of thing topped with truffle), mac and cheese, the scallops and the wellington. And of course the fresh bread, delicious!  You can't go wrong picking Bardot as one of your vacation restaurant choices or as a place for locals to celebrate on The Strip.",

    "text": "Excellent brunch! We aren't one for fighting the buffet lines or stuffing our faces first thing in the morning so this place was perfect. This restaurant has a great modern French vibe and very flavorful food.   We started out with the \"best butter in the world\" for an extra $5 and it was worth it. The butter was that classic French butter with a side of rock salt. It wasn't hard and easy to spread on the cut bread that was served with the butter. The tables that did not upgrade the butter had small French baguettes that also looked good but our bread was amazing. Perfect spongy texture on the inside with a crunchy crust on the outside. Definitely worth the upgrade if you like bread and butter.   I wanted to be a little healthy before overindulging the rest of the day so I tried a side salad to start. Amazing. It had a light citrus vinegarette and very fresh lettuce. The lettuce tasted like butter lettuce but had more color to it. Simple salad but packed with flavor.   I ordered the steak and eggs for my main. Not the most flavorful but cooked exactly medium rare like I asked for. I didn't see my steak knife and ended up using a butter knife the whole time and had no issues cutting it. Eggs were pretty standard but did look like European eggs because the yolk was more orange.   As sides we got the thick cut bacon. Super thick cut and it was delicious. No burnt taste to it and so flavorful. We would definitely order this side again.   Overall, great experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Lots of flavor in all the food. Typical French menu with a few twists and extras to cater to Americans. Great decor. We will definitely be going back for brunch.",

I ordered an Irish coffee which arrived cold. They took it back and heated it and it took way too long, and arrived barely luke warm. Hubby ordered the Huntsman Waffle with the duck confit and poached eggs, asked for the eggs poached hard, they came extremely soft so he sent them back. The rest of our group went ahead and ate, and it took a long time for my husband's meal to come out. No apology, no concession on the bill. Service was pretty slow also. However, the Nutella sticky bun is awesome, as was the smoked salmon starter.",

Potato square was good and the little mixed green salad was delicious. I had the croque madame. It was gorgeous to look at and the egg was perfectly cooked. However - it was three slices of thick white bread (not grilled or toasted), layered with rolled-up thinly sliced deli ham, brie and bechamel. White bread? American ham? Triple decker? What is this, a play on a club? Our server, the adorable and efficient Colin, had a French accent so when he asked me about my dish, I was honest. I pushed him to admit it was not an authentic execution at all. Crusty, grilled bread and French ham is expected. I'd go back though, because they really are doing good, delicious things there.",

If you are looking for a superb dining experience in Vegas, definitely stop by Bardot!  This is the kind of place when they talk about the best Chefs in the world having the best restaurants in Las Vegas this is one of those restaurants! The atmosphere is very elegant French style, with high ceilings and a stunning European Cafe. When you walk in, the look of the bar and restaurant itself is truly something to behold.  Came here for Brunch and the service was top notch- our server was extremely informative, sweet and on top of everything. We started our meal with the complementary Baguette in a paper bag (how French!) and sea salted butter- I am a big fan of bread and this is among some of the best I've ever had. By recommendation we ordered the Brioche French Toast with vanilla mascarpone, almond brittle, and orgeat syrup. I am not kidding when I say this is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! I don't even like French Toast all that much but this dish is a LIFE-CHANGER! We shared it between two people and couldn't finish so I'd say order one for the table or share between 3-4 unless you want some leftovers for when you come home at 4AM from the Club!

The food was a bit slow in coming- though everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered. The french onion soup was delicious. We ran out of time and could not wait any longer for desert. I'm afraid I was tuned-off from the moment I arrived due to the in-ineffeciency of the hostess and the dour looks on the waiter's faces....

I was stuck ordering a $30 salad that was just a bunch of lettuce leaves and a boiled chicken. My friends had the duck confit, the French toast and American breakfast and they were not impressed for the price that we paid!

    "text": "Meh.  I've experienced much better is a good way to describe the meal we had here.  We came here for brunch and with no reservation, we sat at the bar, which is fine.  That's what we do a lot of times anyway, but the only seats open were on a corner.  We grabbed them to make sure we had seats and then waited for about 10 minutes before anyone greeted us.  The bartenders took care of the parties to our right and to our left, but did not acknowledge us until after they had taken care of both of those parties.  Finally we got a couple of waters.  We weren't sure what we wanted yet so we took a few minutes to look at the menu - and moved down a few seats when a couple left.  Much more room which was nice!  A couple of bartenders asked us several different times if we wanted bar drinks, and when we kept saying no, they seemed to be irritated. We like a good cocktail but weren't in the mood.  I ended up ordering the French Omelette and my husband ordered the Bardot Breakfast Sandwich.  The dishes came out about 15 or so minutes later which wasn't bad.  They were not like any other French omelette or egg dishes either of us have ever had, though - the eggs were...well done.  My omelette was so firm it held it's shape like a Japanese egg omelette would, and it also did not have any fine herbs or Gruyere in it that I could see, and had no seasoning at all.  I added salt & pepper which helped, but it still just tasted like plain egg.  My husband's egg sandwich had these little rectangles of the same, firmly cooked eggs, and they were almost like a styrofoam consistency.  We really should have sent it all back, but since the bartenders already seemed irritated by us not ordering drinks we didn't want to rock the boat.  We just ate what we could, paid and left.  It wasn't inedible but it definitely wasn't worth the price and wasn't a good experience. It's a shame because I love French food, and the place had a great atmosphere.",

We wished we had ordered a different appetizer. Then the four of us ordered moules frites, gnocchi, scallops, and a filet mignon w/ frites.   I wish I had ordered something other than the gnocchi. The filet was okay but I've definitely tasted better. The fries that came with the mussels and filet were just not good. They were really crispy but had basically nothing inside. I can't speak for the scallops or mussels, but my friends weren't ecstatic about their choice either.  The inside of the restaurant is nice and dark, but once again nothing amazing. It's mainly disappointing because we had been looking forward to coming here for weeks leading up to our trip. It might be a better choice to come here for brunch in the future!",

    "text": "I have to say this has been my favorite Brunch in Vegas. I hate to say it, but even better than Bouchon Bistro. Michael Mina's French Brasserie located in the Aria Hotel is beautifully decorated Parisian style which transports you to a cafe in Paris. The first Brunch item was the Paris Eggs Benedict which was a variation of the traditional Eggs Benedict which is usually served on an English Muffin. Instead the eggs were nestled on top of a buttery flaky croissant. Must I say this was perfection and was Simply divine. We also ordered the French Toast which was made of Brioche and had a caramelized top. It was served with Vanilla Marscapone, candied almonds and instead of maple syrup it was served with orgeat syrup which is a sweet syrup made of almonds. Simply divine. For the side dish I had to try the macaroni gratinee.  This dish was a take on Macaroni and cheese but elevated to new heights. All of the Macaroni are perfectly aligned standing upright. How, you ask, I have no idea, but who cares the taste was amazing. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Vegas.  I might even stay at The Aria just to have easier access to Bardot Brasserie.",

    "text": "2 wks ago I went to Bardot Brasserie on a date. I want to commend the waiters for exceptional service. Our waiter recognized we were on a date and gave us the space and time to get to know each other. My date had the french onion soup which was marvelous, and I had the king crab crepe. It was gorgeous and had great flavor, but it was served warm, not hot. By the 3rd bite, it was cold. I thought maybe that was what this dish's temp was supposed to be. then we had entrees, I had the pork chop with their wild macaroni side. The chop was also warm, not hot, and so was the macaroni. let me be clear: none of the food we were served was above room temp. I would have returned all of it but for date appearances. the chop was brined and very well seasoned. but it was cold! the dessert, apple tart tartin, was one of the best I ever had. Sadly, most of the meal was the same temp as the ice cream on top of the tartin.",

I wanted the au poivre sauce.  They were nice enough to spit the entree between us.  She also ordered the French onion soup.  Oh my WORD is all I can say about the food - Sacre Bleu!!!!  When I say delicieux- I mean DEE-LISH-SHUS!  wow, oh, WOW!!!!  The soup was spot on.  Absolutely mouth watering and exactly what you'd want from French onion soup.  Not too salty, the croutons were perfect and the cheese was just the right texture.  The steak - oh, heavens..... cooked to make you want it as a blanket so you can tuck yourself into it with the frites as little pillows you can munch on in your happy dreams.  (too much? maybe but it was just that good).  The atmosphere was very nice as well, medium lighting so you could be there with platonic friends or on a romantic date and they have great staff who are very helpful.  We had a great time, I would absolutely go back when I am in Vegas again.",

The food was excellent, the prices were reasonable (for Vegas), and the service was top notch.    Between the everyone in the group, I think we ordered just about all of the appetizers and about half the entrees. I loved everything I tried and I didn't hear a single complaint from anyone.  The onion soup is the top 2 or 3 I've ever had, as was the beef tartare. My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and incredibly flavorful. I was able to sample their mac and cheese, which had a look that I've never seen before, and it was excellent.   I was pleased with how great the service for our group was considering how many people we had.  I think a place deserves to be recognized when they can effortlessly handle a large group.  My only complaint is minor -- I wish they'd add a hard cider or two to their beer menu. I don't like most beers and I don't like wine, so I ended up having to stick to Diet Coke because they didn't have any ciders.  That being said, it won't keep me from coming back!",

I must say that the experience from walking through the doors to dessert was off the charts great.  The location within Aria is odd, given it is situated with two other restaurants at the end of a corridor on the second floor of a poorly trafficked area.  Upon entering Bardot, you feel like you found the coolest French inspired speak easy around.  The restaurant is alive with energy, the drinks potent, the menu selection is celestial, and the service PERFECT.  I was in with a large party, and our server delivered a mix of seasoned professional with comic relief.  Being a picky pescatarian, I was offered a special plate from Chef, although I declined.  I was so touched that the Chef would make something special for me, and delivered such an amazing epicurean experience, I couldn't stop raving about the food while there that our server arranged to bring out Chef Jeannie.  She was such a great sport and chatted with us for a while.    We started with assorted appetizers, and all were exceptional.  I had the Salad Bardot, and the Salmon Aux Lentils.  Both were 10's.  I topped it off with the chocolate macarone, this was rich and could be split with two others.  I dine in Vegas regularly, and have been let down more times than I was inspired, and this place hit the spot.  Please make the effort to try Bardot.",

My fiance's mother made a reservation on OpenTable the night before so we could get in for brunch as soon they opened. It was the Saturday morning before Mother's Day so even before the doors opened it got busy & crowded so we were very grateful we had a reservation. They took us right away because they saw us waiting there the longest. Respectful! We were led through the beautiful restaurant to a back table right near the kitchen. The place was absolutely beautiful decorated with fresh, blooming flowers and Parisian inspired decor. It brings you right to France . Las Vegas dining has always been my favorite because of how in depth the theming and decorating always creates such an atmosphere that is transcending and gives you not just a meal, but an experience. We haven't even talked Food yet! The brunch menu was to die for. I could've ordered anything and I would've been delicious. We decided to order a large French press for the table. It took a little while but it was so delicious. They also gave you two baguettes per table with delicious hand made, whipped butter to accompany.  My fiance & I split the \"American in Paris\" breakfast, how appropriate! My fiance's mother got the egg white & kale quiche which was delicious. We also ordered the assorted pastry basket as an appetizer with our coffee to nibble on. Everything was fresh, delicious, and served with such presentation. The service was wonderful, the manager occasionally checked in on us to make sure we were doing well. There was an accordion player making his way through the tables telling jokes and playing Parisian music. Overall, this experience is not one to be missed!",

When in Vegas, you can't go wrong with fruit and beignets. PRIME STEAK TARTARE -ground to order, sauce verte, egg yolk, toasted baguette. Couldn't get enough. Maine Lobster Croissant Benedict - Love the croissant twist - eggs were perfectly poached, and filled with ample amounts of lobster!   For Dessert! MILLE FEUILLE - caramelized puff pastry, vanilla creme patissiere CREME BRULEE - vanilla bean custard, turbinado croquant  And bottomless sparkling rose for $25 or rose for $20?! Must keep the good feeling going..",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Bardot for Christmas in 2017, and had their escargot, lamb, and pork. Everything was really good back then. The restaurant wasn't too crowded, and food was awesome. The escargot was cooked inside a very fluffy pastry, lamb and pork were well seasoned and perfectly cooked.   We went back to Bardot in Oct of 2018, and ordered the escargot, prime rib, and octopus. This time, everything was terrible. The prime rib was cooked medium well (i ordered med rare), the crust seasoning was non-existent, and for some reason, the prime rib did not have an brow section. Was the worst prime rib I've had ever. The octopus was dry, overcooked, and over-seasoned. The escargot pastry was not fluffy at all, but soggy.   not sure what happened, but maybe their head chef is not there on Monday (or no longer there). For its very pricey menu, we did not get a good meal. It's sad, because we really liked their food the first time, and felt the restaurant was unique   I told the server about the poor quality of the meal, and while he did offer to take it back to the chef (I really didn't want to stay and wait any longer) he didn't offer any discounts or coupons. Would've been nice",

The service- Our waitress from beginning to end was attentive without being annoying. (I'm kicking myself for not remembering her name). She checked in frequently, helped correct a minor thing with one of our dishes, and had a great personality. The food- wonderful! We had the bone marrow (heaven!), beet salad, frisee salad, mussels, and half chicken. Everything was done perfectly and was flavorful and holy crap good! We had to roll on out of the restaurant and didn't get a chance to try dessert (I guess we'll have to go back). The wine by the glass selection was broad enough to easily pair with each dish. Yes, it was a pricey meal, but worth every penny!  Well done Bardot team!",

I had the la varenne cocktail (cognac, liqueur, lemon juice), bone marrow au poivre appetizer, poulet roti entree with mushroom bread pudding and haricots verts, and frozen paris brest for dessert. My fiance had the pork chop.   La varenne was a little too sweet and not strong enough. The caramelized onions that came with the bone marrow was a little too salty, but the country bread was perfect. The paris brest should probably be more of the traditional variety, as opposed to with hazelnut ice cream, as the ice cream hardened the choux pastry and made it less enjoyable altogether.   A little bit of a limited menu.",

Truffle fries- 1 star.  The fries were undercooked, meaning touch and hard on the inside, and not crisp on the outside. The flavoring was off with too much salt.   Oysters- 2 stars. Got 1 dozen oysters, thinking I'd be blown away like last time, but no, I unfortunately wasn't.   Steak tar tar- 2 stars. This dish was OK as well. It was almost too cold in temperature, as though it had been thawed only a couple hours ago and chopped up.   Service- 5 stars. They checked on the table multiple times and water was filled constantly.   Based on my recent experience, I won't be back.",

I started with a glass (or two?) of Brut Rose. The group I was with ordered the Macaroni & Mimolette Gratinee to try out. Loved the presentation of it! I went with the Rack of Lamb and Frites for my entree. The lamb was absolutely tender and just so delicious!  It was cooked to perfection (i.e. medium rare), and the basil and garlic sauce was a nice compliment to the lamb without being overpowering. The chickpea fries were a pleasant surprise and something I would love to have again! If you're looking for a meal worth spending money on, I highly recommend visiting Bardot!",

On this visit I started off with fresh squeezed orange juice and the pastry basket which includes a variety of 4 very fresh and very flavorful pastry. There are a number of starters and if you like escargot, theirs is carefully wrapped in puff pastry and cannot be beat. Others in my party started with a Bloody Mary and they claim it's their favorite anywhere - it's made with fresh squeezed tomato juice. There were a number of entrees ordered at our table but I went with the Prosciutto Benedict (one of 4 varieties.) BARDOT serves their Benedict's on croissants which is a pleasant deviation from tradition. The eggs were perfectly poached and the bearnaise was well balanced.   You should also know that the portions are generous which provides a hearty start to a full day on the town!",

We ordered the beef tartare, duck wings, onion soup and oysters as starters. They gave us fresh bread and butter, that was even delicious! The onion soup is AMAZING! We added short ribs and a poached egg in the soup and it is seriously a game changer. I've never enjoyed a soup so much, its definitely something you can share as well.  My gf and I ordered the rack of lambs and shared it, when they brought it out the actually split the dish into two plates and it was more than enough! That mac and cheese is sooooooo good, definitely split it with some folks at the table because its rich. I am so glad we came here and we left super full.

Foie Gras - my favorite thing on the planet when done right. This was the biggest disappointment: it came overcooked (one side burnt) and extremely salty. The polenta it sat on top of, on the other hand, seemed completely unseasoned.   I really hope I got unlucky, as this place has huge potential; however, my food simply did not taste good.",

I've been here a few times and really appreciated the friendly, prompt and humble service we had here.   The food was decent above average style Strip food, a slight edge over Mon ami Gabi (love their steak) only because of the foie gras here.   ---- Recommend ---- * Foie gras parfait - 5 stars: Smooth, decadent, and absolutely perfect with their fresh bread.  * Hangar steak - 4 stars: Surprisingly good from what it appears but the fries were overly oily.   ---- Pass ---- * Chocolate Macaron - 3 stars: IG-worthy enormous macaron the size of your head, nothing special.  * Mac n cheese - 2 stars: This looked so cool because it is a baked square of mac n cheese with each noodle facing up! It tasted very mediocre don't waste your stomach room on this one.  * Steak tartare - 3 stars: Fine, standard. Liked the potato chips. Wouldn't order again * Salad - 2 stars: Pretty terrible bland sparse salad.",

    "text": "I would like to name this meal \"The Tour of Bardot\" by Erik and Nelson. I had one of the most memorable experience dinning at this facility because of how knowledgeable they are. It wasn't a dull dinner but I had entered into the passionate dinning food experience, I get to learn a little about the restaurant history and other sister restaurant they have.  As a business owner myself, I recognized when someone is very prideful about what they do and their food. They didn't just being a monotonous workers who are trying to up sale but they get to know what are your taste styles and go from there! Thank you you guys tremendously for such a marvelous tour of Bardot.  Okay, let's get back to the actual food tour after the gratitude messages.  I actually found my favorite cocktail here at BARDOT; Strawberry Blanc. It tastes like strawberry juice. My personal favorite starters and sides are Macaroni & Mimolette gratinee with sauce bechamel, Escargot Bardot, Lobster Thermidor and last but not least Lobster bisque.  We got  Heritage Chicken Roti (which takes 3 days to prepared) and grilled over oak woods Prime Ribs. Very tenders and just melt in your mouth.   Next up! Dessert! The best part of the meal.  CHOCOLATE MACARON & ESPRESSO CREME BRULEE are absolutely delicious! I can eat them everyday. The perfect amount of sweetness  I also fell in love with this Black Lavender Tea, OMG!!!!!! It's a must try.",

We came for dinner and We had the beef tartare which I devoured before taking any pictures because I was starving but let me tell you it was delish! I highly recommend it!   The complimentary bread and butter were equally impressive. I mean THATZ BUTTER DOE!!!! Its supposed to be the best butter ever and it really was! I was just spooning butter in my mouth like it was another dish all on it's own!  The seafood platter we recieved was so delish! The oysters were small but super sweet and fresh! It came with this mini Tabasco sauce bottle and it was just so adorbs! I kinda had to take it home with me lololz  The shrimp and crab and lobster were opened for easy access and easy dining. It was just so amazingly good! Definitely recommend it if you want the overall seafood experience! Definitely worth it and it was definitely fresh! I also loved the variety of sauces they give with it instead of the typical cocktail sauce and calling it a day.  We also had the lobster bisque which was also really good and they give you this puff pastry with it which was so flaky and soft. It was a bit on the sweet side but still really good!   The lamb doe... omg let me tell you! It was the best lamb that I have ever tasted! It had no gamey taste what so ever and it was so soft and cooked to the Medium rare perfection that I had asked for.   All in all, an excellent experience! Would recommend this place if you're ever in the Vegas area!",

The lighting & ambiance is nice, it was just very loud. We were sitting very close in between two other tables & we could hear every word they were saying, & I felt like we were shouting over them to have a conversation.   The food was amazing! We're both lovers of French food & Bardot did not disappoint. Make sure you eat the bread with the delicious butter- I hardly ever eat bread & it's totally worth it here!   We had the Foie Gras Parfait for a starter, He had the Heritage Chicken & I had the Scallops Meuniere & every bite was absolutely wonderful! The portions I feel are very generous for French cuisine.   The service was the only thing that was lacking. Thus only four stars (I would give 3 1/2 if I could). Our server was very inattentive. It took forever to just order our drinks. He didn't even come by after we received our entrees to see if we needed anything. Never offered/asked if we wanted another drink when our first ones were gone. Although we were full from our meal I kind of wanted to try dessert but didn't want to wait for the waiter since he was taking so long. Our bus boy was amazing though! It was super busy & he seemed like he may have been new.   All in all I would definitely go back. I'm wanting to try their brunch ;)",

Maybe it was the service and their lobster.   First time I was at the bar and second time (this review) was at main dining room.  Highlight of the food I've ate and highly recommend: stick with their burger and you can't go wrong.   Lobster thermidor at $76 was over cooked. Also. why such a small lobster tail for that price? This is the reason I knocked down a star too. I think my local grocery has larger lobster tails than this!   The foie gras appetizer was great, but why on earth did they add the lentils. Not necessary and kind of ruined the delicate piece of foie gras.   Sea bass was a quite large dish and tasted great. A really good size portion too.   Service at the bar was way more friendlier than the waiter we got. He was just an order taker and really didn't have any charm or personality.  Thus the other star drop, bringing this to a 3 star review.   Maybe I had such high expectations from my first visit, but kind of left here unsatisfied.",

This was my first time trying it, so I decided to do it a little different, instead of ordering an entree I order the beet and goat cheese salad, half dozen oysters, and truffle fries.  The beet salad was soooo good! I love every ingredient in there. Beets, goat cheese, arugula, etc. The oysters were fantastic with all the fixings mixed in, and the truffle fries were great also.  I got to sample my friends dishes as well, and everyone was extremely happy with their choices.  Fantastic service and wine pairing was perfect. Maybe the only knock was that it was kind of loud. But next time maybe we'll request a quieter table area.   But that's it, can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "What a hidden gem in the Aria set just next to Jean George's Steak House! The service was amazing (we had a group of 11 tucked into a table near the front), the food was fantastic, and decor transportive. I feel like not enough people have mentioned the great deal of the $25 bottomless rose (still or sparkling) special that a bunch of people ordered with brunch. Our server, Latisha, was very accommodating and kind to our group. She even kindly split the checks into about 5 groups!  The french bread served prior to the meal was to die for: super crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. As a novice bread baker, it really got my creative juices going. I certainly feel the need to go and try out a variety of french baguettes until I find something that resembles that bread!   For the two of us: french onion soup $18 was just amazing. You can tell the cheese wasn't crazy heated under a salamander for tons of time prior to serving. The broth was deep and flavorful with the perfect amount of bread inside. I wish I could make something that came even somewhat close to the caliber of that soup! We also split a frisee lardon salad ($19) and prosciutto benedict ($21). While you can skip the frisee (mostly eaten so that we could say we had something green), the benedict on a croissant was delicious. After going to Parma, we are suckers for proscuitto de Parma... Yum. Lastly, a large french press coffee was $9.50. This lasted around half of the table and was worth the cost as well. Overall, totally worth the price and probably the best hang-over-curing-brunch I'll ever eat.",

Came in for lunch and decided to try escargot for my first time. All I have to say is I typically don't like this texture, but BARDOT certainly knows what they're doing as this was the most approachable escargot ever! So great and definitely worth a try. Also loved the Mac n cheese and Caesar salad. Martinis were on point and we totally appreciated the amazing service from Raymond and his staff!",

    "text": "escargots are snuggled in this happy basil-y puff pastry the size of a grape that you can just pop in your mouth - it's creamy, tasty, and delicate. Delicate! not overly parmy-garlicky-oily. I would get it again. Foie gras in a cup is silky smoooooth and not overpowering. The flavour is also delicate. The top jelly adds a good punch to the smoothness of the foie pate. The Charcuterie board is a must. It has a slew of terrines, rillettes, sliced meats, bread, yum yum yum and more yum yum yum.  At this point you stop. because you are full. Really it's filling. Oh and the $5 best butter in the world... comes w a baguette and another home made butter. The verdict was that the home made butter wins over the best butter in the world... haha... But you can decide that for yourself. Their bread game is strong (makes sense, they are french) But all apps came w. different breads. They are all crispy, chewy, bouncy inside... so good.  Like a casper matress. As to entres, I don't know why I opted for the duck a l'orange. Eeverytime I see duck or goose i opt for it... i wish the sauce came on the side (i know, sounds like a faux pas) But i wonder if the sauce made the duck skin soggy.  I like my crispy skin! the sauce was okay- served w white asparagus and ramps.  The duck itself was sliced and it could have been shared it was 7\" long x 4\" ... I will say it was overcooked on the 4 slices of each end and the 4 slices in the center were perfect.   NOW - I don't know why i didn't opt for the prime rib. But lucky me two people in my party did... and PERSONALLY.... get the prime rib ONLY IF: YOU ADORE THE FATTIES. MY GOODNESS. it was a celebration to me. Fatties have so much delicious flavor... swoop a little of the beef jus and tear a piece of that crispy baguette (add a little homemade butter - why not) and it's a bite of heavy... the fatties are like another type of bone marrow... uuuugh.... so SO SO SO SO good...  People can be turned off by the fatties, but bring me and i will demolish it. Get the prime rib.  ah! ok fyi: when i go to a steakhouse i ask if the prime rib will have fatties. Bardot has a SERIOUS prime rib - like Parisian style steak prime rib not americanized. it's got a good 1\" x 4\" swirl of happy fatty in the center and a bit on the perimeter too... it's (personally) excellent.  our waiter was LOVELY.",

They all seem the same. After much research, we decided to have brunch at Bardot Brasserie. We typically stay at Aria but have never tried this restaurant.  We had a wonderful brunch there with Shannon as our server. I had the wonderful (and crazy big) french toast and my husband had the breakfast sandwich. We shared an order of bacon and enjoyed the bottomless sparkling rose.  Everything was wonderful and Shannon (and others) kept the rose coming.. Thank you Shannon!  We have another trip planned for September and can't wait to return to Bardot for Sunday brunch. We also plan to try it for dinner. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "AMAZING!!!! We came here for my girlfriends birthday brunch. We did have reservations and were seated promptly. Our dishes were really delicious. Our top favorite in order are 1:Hunters Waffle (seriously a Must) the duck was cooked to perfection, moist, Flavorful and not gamy at all.  2:King crab & Endive salad. It came in little lettuce cups with delicious crab and a citrus dressing. Very refreshing and just melts in your mouth. A good balance to have between all the carbs! Next was the Charcuterie board and even though I'm not an Escargot fan, the dish here was great! We also had the Maine lobster scramble, it was ok Nothing special about it. Not worth the $29. The Truffle fries are a MUST, so is the Nutella sticky bun, and the chocolate macaroon. The French toast is super popular, not too sweet and a hearty portion. Wish it was served with ice cream, that would have been a better compliment in my opinion.! And for those lushes out there, don't forget to add the Everlasting Rose.! Everything tastes better with a little bubbly! Overall excellent service, ambiance and food quality. Thanks BARDOT for a beautiful dinning experience.!!!",

Square bar up front has both bar seating and some tables for those looking for a drink and something quick.  We had amazing service from Matthew and really enjoyed the recommendations.  We started with a loaf of bread with amazing butter from Normandy (beurre d'echire A.O.C.) and the shrimp cocktail (U10s) that were nicely seasoned.  This was followed up with the Parisian Gnocchi (tete de moine cheese, morel mushrooms, black truffle shavings and roasted garlic veloute) and the King Crab Crepe (buckwheat flour crepe, open faced with trumpet mushrooms, sunny-side egg and a brittany cider beurre blanc).    We did get a couple of toasted marshmallows to finish off the meal.  Perfect way to end this trip to Vegas and head back home.",

Upon arrival the host was sweet to assist and let us know that we still had a little time to kill :) We made our way to the beautiful bar and got us the best tasting champagne \"Renardat-Fache\" - or they call it \"Bugey/boogie Fache\" - delicious fruity sparkling champagne!  As we were checking out the menu we knew right away what we wanted and go into work! Our server was great! He knew my love for food will need more space on our table!   We ordered the following: - King Crab Crepe $22 - Literally the most interesting dish I've ever had so far! King crab w/ fried eggs? Who knew?!?!!? DELICIOUS! - Bone Marrow en Persillade $19 - served with 2 different flavor bread I say this is one AMAZING dish.. the only thing I didn't like was the thickness of the bread...maybe a little thin slice wouldn't hurt (Do not plan on getting full with just bread) - Scallops Meuniere $46 - HUGE I mean HUGE scallops I've ever seen in my life! Perfectly cooked and full of flavor I LOVE! - Loup de Mer au Fenouil $56 - MY FAV DISH! I enjoyed this plate very much! the buttery sauce with enough lemon...PERFECT. Boneless: easy to eat & the skin peels right off~~ DAMNNN drooool - Bone in New York Strip , Creekstone $61 - Cooked to perfection and truffle fries.. Perfect match! My love enjoyed this VERY MUCH! - Roasted Brussel Sprout $14 - GET IT!!!!!!  Overall this place is AMAZING and I give my man 2 thumbs up on choosing this place for our romantic dinner + being wise on making reservation beforehand :) (thats a MUST)",

    "text": "After Michael Mina closed out American Fish which I was fan of, I was happy to see that he opened another place in Aria. I've been here a few times for brunches and dinners since it opened. I was satisfied each time I left the restaurant.   Service: I've received 5 star attentive services each time I was there. My bottomless rose was always filled up before I noticed. Huge plus for me. On my recent visit, our waitress did a great job on assisting my friend picking out the menu.   Environment: it is a casual French place. Sometimes the noise level can be quite high which I don't mind. The decor and atmosphere makes me feel like I'm actually dining in Paris.   Food: I had more brunch experiences here than dinner. I've enjoyed my brunch items each time. Although I was disappointed that lobster Benedict is no longer on the menu. Since it's been a few years when I had the dinner here, this review is purely based on brunch. Get BOTTOMLESS rose! For $25, it's so worth it. I also really enjoy the foie gras parfait here. It's not too salty nor it has the gaminess. The steak tartare and Escargot are also good appetizer choices to share among the table. The bread here is so yummy. My croissant Benedicts were delicious. Although I preferred the lobster one they used to have on the menu rather than short rib. I just tried their French toast yesterday. The portion was huge. The almond brittle was so yummy with the toast. I recommend to share another savory entrees or have the French toast as dessert.   This place is definitely one of my favorite brunch spot and I highly recommend you to come check it out if you haven't already!",

    "text": "We got a chance to return to the beautiful Bardot Brasserie during our 2019 vacation--this time for a full dinner. We came in at the end of the evening on Tuesday without a reservation and got sat right away. I was most impressed with our server, Jesus, who took such wonderful care of us when we were the very last table sat that evening and stayed past closing.   Our server was gracious and ever so patient with us as we were such indecisive guests. Jesus provided spot-on recommendations for wines by the glass as well as our appetizers and entrees. We are so appreciative that he went over in detail (more than once!) the soft shell blue crap appetizer that was being served as a special as neither of us had ever had the opportunity to try one.  Our dinner, of course, was excellent. My boyfriend got the soft shell crab special and I ordered the steak tartare because I had such fond memories of how incredible it was when I enjoyed it three years ago. Both dishes were incredible and might have outshone the entrees. And now that we've finally had soft shell crab, we may be ruined forever because I can't imagine it will taste nearly as good anywhere else.   For our main entrees, I ordered the beautiful sea bass, my boyfriend ordered the filet, and we ordered a side of Brussels sprouts. My sea bass was perfectly prepared but wasn't a standout item--I'll be getting something different next time, like the filet! My boyfriend's steak was incredible and was one of the best filets I've ever had. it was perfect, and I will be dreaming about it until I return to Vegas. Sadly, the side of Brussels sprouts was lackluster and will not be ordered again. But that's small complaint for what was such a special meal. Kudos to the team at Bardot Brasserie!",

I have to say it may have been the best dining experience I have ever had. With the recommendation of our waiter, who was super nice and attentive the whole evening, we started with the escargot.  It was amazing, I wanted to order another round but knew I needed to hold off for the main course. We ordered the deluxe shellfish tower and oak smoked pork. The shellfish tower had to be the best seafood I have had.  It came with crab, lobster, oysters, and jumbo shrimp.  I like seafood, but do not love seafood, and this platter made me love seafood.  Everything was so fresh tasting as if they had just pulled it out of the ocean.  The pork chop was amazing as well, grill over an oak fire gave the meat this delicious natural smoke flavor unlike the acidic smokey flavor from processed marinades.  For dessert we ordered the espresso creme brulee which was served with fresh biegnets and it was delicious.  Overall, the best part about this restaurant is how they do not cut corners any where on the menu.  Everything is fresh and cooked to perfection.  We will be back next time we are in Vegas!",

It was huge and can easily be split either three people, but is a must have plate. I had the steak with fried eggs and my wife had the avocado eggs Benedict and she said it was good.   The only thing that we believe was the service. It was very good but our particular server was always in a rush and I had to flag him down many times to just ask for water, coffee and bread. I didn't understand why he didn't spend more time at our table.",

    "text": "Given the option of a buffet or Bardot, always go with Bardot!  Always!  This was absolutely one of the better choices made on a recent trip to Vegas, unlike the one where I kept forgetting to collect my winnings and walk away from the table.  Hate when that happens.    The service for brunch was so comforting, especially when you are recovering from a late night.  We were so hungry and started to order more than we should, so our oh so polite and professional server made a recommendation on how to serve our meal that worked out perfectly.  We started with the king crab crepe.  The crepe was so light and tasty.  I secretly wished I didn't have to share that one because I could have finished it in a minute.  My hunny ordered the filet mignon and eggs and I had the smoked salmon croissant benedict, which I absolutely loved being served on a croissant rather than a english muffin.  The texture and taste was good, though it was a bit salty which I just figure is due to the smoked salmon.  The filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium.  I have to say, even the salted butter and bread was spot on for our meal.    For our finale, we had the nutella sticky bun for dessert, because why not.  Our server recommended this as a dessert rather than a starter and I'm so glad she did.  At first I thought there was no way we could eat it after all we just ate.  But the sticky bun was much lighter than I expected and even with the heavy nutella, it wasn't as sweet as it looked.  It was the perfect amount of sugar to end our lovely meal.  I will absolutely add this as one of my go to places next time I'm in Vegas baby!  Can't wait to try it again!",

Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and worked with a professional sense of urgency.  The kitchen kept the high end dishes coming on time throughout the evening.  Brasserie cuisine: The \"World's best butter\" with the sea salt was tasty and I kept carb loading because of it.  The Maine Lobster Bisque was a little off for me (little too much brandy or dry sherry?) but had this amazing type of cracker paired with it that I've never seen before. (see pic).  The cheese plate was solid and the charcuterie/meat board was awesome, that prosciutto!  I tried some of my friend's moules frites/mussels and it was tasty, perfect amount of garlic butter.  I went with the Rack of Lamb and it was delicious.  Prepped and cooked perfectly, and something I'd order again.  Every time I see truffle fries, it's an auto order and Bardot's was great.  Ambiance:  Beautiful inside and out, the brasserie lighting and decor makes for a wonderful dining experience.  The Dark wood tables and burgundy leather chairs are comfortable. The rectangular bar by the entrance is designed beautifully, almost chandelier like.  Bardot Brasserie just made my list of great restaurants for a first date.  The delicious cuisine is as pretty as the lovely restaurant which enhances your dining experience.  Everything looks good, tastes good and I'm looking forward to the next visit to try more dishes. That's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy..! =)",

Bardot - with an interesting intersection of French and California wines.  Bardot - with a menu and a wait-staff that each looked the part but that each fell regrettably short.  Bardot - with so much promise, but the promise it keeps will be a pedestrian stroll along the wrong side of the Seine, with the \"best butter in the world\" (please....) served with charred slices of grocery store Vienna white bread.    The salmon aux lentilles would have, perhaps, fared better without the uninspired, unseasoned and under-cooked salmon (medium means medium, not rare).    The semolina gnocchi featured dry, tater-tot sized pistons of compressed mashed potatoes, with a few truffles.  I like mashed potatoes, I would have enjoyed a nice truffled mashed potato dish, but we ordered gnocchi.  So there's that.  Go for the atmosphere my friends, have a nice bowl of baked French onion soup with your glass of wine and then call it a night!",

This place is absolutely lovely, I don't use the word lovely too often and there's reason for that (a lot of spots don't warrant it). The little touches from the interior, lighting, old-school feel and fresh roses all over the place really add to your overall experience.   We ordered a ton of different things and I also convinced all of my friends to try their Escargot they had on the menu. They were baked into these perfect little pastries and topped with an amazing sauce, tres magnifique! Hopefully I used that properly, either way I would definitely recommend this spot if you are in Las Vegas and it is definitely worth the reservation and price tag.",

Great music and great vibe. And This was on a Tuesday night. I cannot imagine being here on a Friday night.  This place is huge with plenty of sitting.  4/5   Food: i kept my meal light.  I ended up ordering escargots,  king crab salad, and the steak tartare. The steak tartare was on point with seasoning. I wish they gave me more chips.  The escargot was on the drier side and I thought it was missing that heavy garlic taste.  It wasn't bad but it didn't impress me at all.  The king crab salad was interesting.  I thought it would be chunky meat in it. But they kind shredded it.  The salad was very light but it looked like it was a lot.  My personal thought that this place is overpriced for that type of food that they served.  But the food was good, not wow great to justify their prices.  4/5  Service:  the bartender was on point and attentive.  4.5/5   Overall I would come back to try a few other dishes for out of curiosity.",

Two courses of appetizers, entrees, and dessert.  The appetizers were delicious. Entrees of prime rib and sea bass with a side of the most delicious macaroni and cheese.  (I could make a meal of the Mac and cheese with a toasty cheese top and perfectly stacked macaronis!) The prime rib was very tasty and the sea bass perfectly prepared whole. The desserts were a trio of espresso pudding, chocolate cookie and cream stack and a Napoleon like pastry. Each was excellent.   The service was attentive but not intrusive with excellent suggestions for cocktails and wine pairings. Pacing was excellent.   The restaurant itself is French bistro like, very nice. Noise was a little loud, but reasonable for a busy place.",

We started off with a bottle of Perrier-Jouet, and ordered a beet salad and cheese plate for the table... a-mazing. The beets were super fresh, well dressed with great oil, and served along an amazing cheese. The cheese plate was to die for--our waiter made some expert selections, and I find myself googling where I can get them locally!   Dinner was excellent. From the chicken my best friend had (not too moist, but not dry at all..almost sous vide perfection) to the beautiful and generous cut of prime rib I had. Each paired well with the selections from the Somm from the great wine list. Sides were hearty and delicious.   I wish we would have had time (or stomach space) for dessert, as I'm sure it would have been amazing.   Truly appreciated the excellent service we received at Bardot as well. I was in the service industry for a while, so I pay attention to the little things--the Sommelier's presentation was perfect, the waiter was an expert with the menu, and the pace of the meal was great. The waiter didn't even flinch when I asked (before the meal, away from the table) about splitting the check 4 ways--extremely accommodating and professional.  I can't say enough great things about this experience. I felt like I was truly in a starred restaurant. Excellent.",

The apps were so incredible we never made it to an entree and repeated the same meal a few days later.  Our favorite dishes... Prime Tartar  Foie Gras with lentils (so good order your own so you don't have to share, trust me) Bone marrow Duck wings  Also the French 75 with gin was excellent and so refreshing.  The vibe is polished and classy but also warm and welcoming. Not a spot to bring your kids. Find it on the 2nd promenade level in Aria.",

    "text": "Let's be clear, there are a LOT of good/excellent restaurants in Las Vegas.  I travel here more than enough to know this. I would say that the food at Bardot is no exception to that rule.  Unfortunately the service is so bad that you can't rank it any higher than a 1.  I mean I have spent time in France, I am French for crying out loud and I can't recall a time where you were supposed to be whisked away to France only to find out that the Tour Guide or in this case the hostess would be better fit working on a corner somewhere rather than guiding you on your journey. I mean I get it, I made a reservation I show you the confirmation of the reservation and somehow in your mind because it shows something different in YOUR system I am a liar.  Also when there are open tables everywhere and you still feel the need to place my party of 4 in a high traffic area, you FAIL.    Beyond her incompetence we have the idea of the \"appetizer\".  In my book the appetizer is supposed to come out first. Hmm..apparently it is different in France (Hint: It isn't different).  They decided here at Bardot to just bring EVERYTHING at once. So that of course while you are eating one thing the other items get cold. FAIL.  If it is there policy to bring everything at once they should at least explain that?!  Oh and of course they forgot a side of frites which was to be included (not ordered separately) for a friend but it only took a half hour to get it to him.  Another glorious fail. All in all this Terrible service give this restaurant a 1 in my book and if I were you I would search for other options in this city. There are plenty of them....f",

Our bread was very delicious with a nice crust, but my Caesar salad made with endives was not what I expected. The chef filled each slice of the endive leaf with like a teaspoon of rich Caesar dressing, so by the time you eat 10, you feel like you've eaten half a cup of dressing. It was too rich and made my stomach sick. I told the waitress and she felt bad, but did not attempt to remedy the situation. She was probably scared to death of her boss. In any event, there were other things on the menu that looked promising. Just try to avoid the Caesar.",

We had a fantastic time experiencing much of what Vegas had to offer but without a doubt the greatest culinary experience of the entire trip was BARDOT Brasserie!!!  We arrived early for our 5:30pm reservation and were shown to the bar to enjoy a drink before being seated,  the Bartender was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and sold us on an amazing sparkling wine the bar itself is clean well stocked and has an incredible ambiance.  We were then seated where we were promptly greeted by our server Matthew,  This guy was nothing short of amazing,  friendly and funny and quick with an answer or suggestion for any question,  He made the dining experience truly enjoyable.  I had the Duck and I am not exaggerating when I say it was the most fantastic Duck I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection and prepared and served quickly really hit all the notes.  Taste, portion size, presentation,  all get five stars.  My wife had the scallops and she had similar things to say about her dish.  If you are a cheese lover do yourself a favor and try the cheese tray!  You will understand what fine cheese is after I promise.  This was definitely one of the major highlights of our trip!  Thank you to everyone at BARDOT Brasserie!  We will most certainly be returning the next time we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "Oh yeah, now we're talking.  A casual modern brasserie that can challenge the best in Paris. Refinements to the menu and subtle changes to classic dishes have greatly improved the restaurant quality.  Continued innovation from the bar further heighten the experience.  Brunch, offered Saturday and Sunday, is a great way to sample the menu. The classics tartare, excellent. Hand cut prime beef mixed with coarse grain mustard and a farm fresh egg yolk.. Slathered on warm toasted baguette. Ahhhh.  Not to be outdone the escargot, tender wine braised snails surrounded by puff pastry and topped with hazelnuts and a chartreuse garlic butter. Good eats. The king crab crepe, rich goodness as the sweetness of the crab is heightened by a cider beurre blanc.  A sunny side up egg adds a velvety mouth feel and sauteed trumpet mushrooms, the classic earthiness.  The piece de resistance, and ungodly French onion soup. Beefy intensely packed full of deeply caramelized sweet onions, braised short rib, a poached egg, and black truffles, then topped by layer of melted gruyere cheese and more truffle. Mix it up and enjoy the richness of the egg as the flavors blend harmoniously together,  The portion sensibly reduced for brunch. Get this.  A good selection of cheeses, mostly imported, and a very well cooked, chilled seafood tower (king crab, lobster, oysters on the half shell, shrimp) also work with endless pours of rose ($20).  Dinner adds an excellent veal sweet bread starter. Braised turnips and trumpet mushrooms add to the enjoyment of the pillowy texture and creamy taste of the sweetbreads. Standout mains include an excellent bouillabaisse, filled with perfectly cooked sweet scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams, cod, calamari, all swimming in a saffron infuse tomato broth. Outstanding. Carnivores, do not pass on the well trimmed, simply seasoned, and perfectly cooked rack of lamb.  Meaty with just a hint of gamey funk.    Service is very efficient and friendly.  Excellent list of craft cocktails. Many designed to pair with the food. Excellent wine list focusing mainly on France. Vegas resort pricing.  My poker bud from France sums it up perfectly.  \"Meh\" when learning the chef isn't French.  Translated \"excellent\".",

    "text": "~ Happy Hour Review ~  If you're looking for an elegant and decadent meal for a reduced price, I highly recommend checking out Bardot Brasserie's Happy Hour menu served daily from 5-7 pm. For under $60, my boyfriend and I ordered four things off the menu (and a cocktail!) Everything we ordered tasting amazing and the atmosphere felt super classy. We stopped by at the start of HH still in our day clothes and felt very underdressed compared to some of the patrons at the bar. We still received great service, regardless of how we were dressed, but if you're the type to dress up, definitely bring your A game when you come here! All the guys and gals I saw at the bar were decked out in suits and evening gowns.   We ordered salmon tartare, steak tartare, a tartine, and a burger. The salmon tartare tasted fresh and light. I especially loved the taste of the chive mascarpone with capers on the top. I'm not normally a fan of the salty, almost fishy-like taste of capers, but the creamy richness of the mascarpone helped to balance everything out. The steak tartare (ground to order!) not only looked super aesthetically appealing, but the richness of the yolk with the perfectly seasoned ground prime steak was simply divine. My boyfriend, however, mentioned that he didn't like the sauce verte drizzled on the top, as it tasted a bit too rich and pungent for his preference. We also ordered a tartine (open-faced sandwich) with grilled shrimp and saffron roullie. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the garlic-y roullie really gave the shrimp the \"oomf\" I was looking for. The bread here is also great. I believe it's baked in house. Also, as a side note - you get free bread and butter as an appetizer. And OMG - the butter here is out of this world. Butter is always awesome, but this butter is something really special. It's so spreadable, creamy, salty, and rich! Best butter I've ever had. Seriously.   But the True highlight of this already amazing meal? The le steakburger, made with a prime rib patty. Yup, you read that right. Prime rib. So flavorful and so, so juicy. The nuttiness of the comte cheese along with a generous spread of garlic aioli on the top just made this burger seriously next level shiz. If I recall, this was the most expensive thing that we ordered (I believe about $19), but it was so worth it. This was arguably the best burger of my life - and I've had a lot of great burgers.  Thanks to Bardot Brasserie for a dining experience that this foodie will remember forever!",

Tucked away with the other restaurants in on the second floor of Aria, they've done a great job turning a closed area into a lively restaurant.  The bad... I'm not sure if the kitchen was backed up or lost our ticket multiple times but service, specifically attention to detail was very lacking until we addressed it with the manager.  Arrived at 9 and menus were not distributed until 10 minutes after we were seated. Drinks were ordered immediately but did not arrive until 9:25. Food was delayed until even later, 10:05 and it was only then that our server asked how we were doing.  It would be one thing if the place was packed, I'm in Vegas enough between trade shows, fight nights, and weekend getaways to understand when things get impacted but on a non-major event weekend the delay and lack of communication during the slow roll out was beyond frustrating.  The gf and I appreciated the team's effort to make it right after we addressed it but you dine at Michael Mina establishments to *not* have to think about the quality of service from the moment you walk in.  At the end of the day, mistakes happen, order tickets get misplaced, and bartenders get busy. Judging from the other diners who've been here our experience might have been the exception not the rule, but it doesn't change the fact that as a patron I went from 'This is a place I'd love to bring clients' to 'can I speak with the manager' in 65 minutes.  2.5 stars.",

We went in sometime around 1045 and were able to get a table without waiting. This is a French Cafe and serves a blend of American and French options.   Our server was pretty quick getting to us initially, but became pretty slow for the remainder of our meal. I had the American In Paris and my girlfriend ordered an Omelette. Our food was also slow getting to us, taking a bit longer than I would have expected for what we ordered. Once it did arrive, everything was very good. The Hash/Potato Cake served to us both was easily the best item we tried. Everything else was more or less what I could have cooked at home. We both had Orange Juice, which must have been fresh-squeezed, because it was probably the best I have ever had (it was like $9 a glass though, FYI). The French Toast they were serving to nearby tables looked really good!  All in all, you can get a pretty good meal here. The restaurant was really clean and has a cool theme and decor. The portions are large and everything is good, just don't bother if you are in a rush and be prepared to spend more than you would expect for Breakfast/Brunch.",

She was very knowledgable about the menu and so personable too. She offered some great recommendations, the sea bass being one, which my friend and I decided to split as our main entree.  I would have loved to try their seared foie gras or escargot but my friend isn't the most adventurous eater and wasn't budging. We agreed to start off with the charcuterie board and share a salad. For our entree I (luckily) talked my friend into the sea bass with the help of Kim's recommendation and reassurance.  Everything. Was. So. Delicious. Even the fresh bread they first brought out with us with butter was baked to perfection!   - Charcuterie board  My goodness, what a variety. Came with toasted bread and a number of unique cheese and meats. Pickles, diced candied peaches, pear slices, and toasted nuts were also flavorful sides that came with the charcuterie. I'm a huge fan of meats and cheeses and was impressed with BARDOT's choices  - Endive salad  We had this salad salad before at BARDOT's opening but remembered loving it. Endives, field greens, spinach, green apple slices, walnuts, and bleu cheese tossed in a delicious light vinaigrette. The perfect salad to share as an app  - Sea Bass The server knew my friend and I were sharing the sea bass so they pre-portioned them separately for us. The sea bass was paired with a small assortment of grilled veggies. Cooked JUST right, the fish was flaky and very tender! My friend isn't the biggest fan of fish but she cleared her entire plate!   For drinks we had a bottle of sparkling wine and also tried these lemon/ginger cocktails. You can never go wrong with sparkling wine and the cocktails were strong yet tasty.   Our overall dining experience was excellent. The phenomenal service and cuisine we first experienced a year ago has not changed one bit. There's such quality in Michael Mina's restaurants and BARDOT is one of the finest. I look forward to coming back - hopefully soon to try their famous brunch!",

    "text": "There were no signs on how to get there since the place is newly opened. Some of the casino employees didn't even know what we were talking about. You have to go up the escalators to the 2nd floor of the Aria and head in the direction of the buffet. The restaurant is before the buffet on the right, next to Jean Georges Steakhouse. They have a few tables outside of the restaurant but since it's inside the Aria, that's the closest to outdoor seating that you're going to get. The dress is business casual. Love the liquor rack over the bar. Simply gorgeous! BTW, HH is daily from 5-7PM in the bar area only. Spacious with very simple but classic decor and very dim lighting. The fancy bathrooms are in the back corner, close to the kitchen on the side of the entrance.   BF was very skeptical about coming here because he is not a Michael Mina fan (he's been to a few of his other restaurants and wasn't impressed). One of my foodie besties went for Valentine's Day and loved it so I was able to convince him to go here with the group. Initially I had wanted to just come here for HH but we all had evening shows to attend so we had a late dinner reservation.  Our Order on 2/28/2015 Foie Gras Parfait: ($15) Ruby Port Gelee, Grilled Country Bread Duck a l'orange: ($13) Wood-grilled Wings, Blood Orange, Sauce Maltaise Onion Soup Grainee: ($14) Add Perigord Truffle, Braised Oxtail & Soft Poached Egg ($25) 8oz Filet Mignon: ($54) Topped with Bearnaise / Au Poivre / Foie Gras Butter and server w/ Beef Fat Fries Le Steakburger: ($19) Prime Rib Patty,, Comte Cheese, Garlic Aioli, Watercress, Bordelaise Onions & Hand-cut Fries Parisian Gnocchi: ($23) Wild Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Roasted Garlic Croque Madame: ($18) Pain de Mie, Paris Ham, Gruyere Fondue, Oranic Egg Sauteed Skate Wing: ($29) Wood-Roasted Cauliflower Puree, Caper-brown Butter, Lemon Carlsbad Mussels Marinieres: ($26) Garlic Butter Dolin Vermouth, Warm Baguette Oak-Fired Duroc Pork Chop: ($36) bacon Lardons, Baby Carrots, Potato Puree, Grain Mustard Potato Puree Red - Glass: ($16) Bouchard Bourgogne Rouge, Burgundy, France 2013. fleshy strawberry and black cherry notes overturned black soil and baking spices Pinot Noir - Bottle: ($133) Domaine Faively 2009. Nuits-St. Georges  Full Menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbutterfly1465.wordpress.com%2F2015%2F03%2F15%2Fbardot-brasserie%2F&s=ec18dd93b2f14f4ff7b6840d2f422c8bcd85f302bd1ec87e9b29c7d890272daa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">butterfly1465.wordpress....</a>  For appetizers I had the Foie Gras Parfait. While it was good, I would've liked more of the Gelee to go with it to balance it out more. There wasn't enough bread to eat with the foie gras so I used the complimentary bread which was fine. We ordered an order of the Duck a l'orange for the table that everyone devoured because they all really enjoyed it. Our friends who ordered the Onion Soup thought that it was amazing (it looked and smelled really good too!).  I had the Sauteed Skate which I would say it was more fried. I had wanted something fairly light since I had all the foie gras earlier in the meal and was a bit disappointed in the skate. It still tasted pretty good (just a bit on the dry side). Loved the pureed cauliflower. Tried some of the BFs Filet Mignon w/ Foie Gras Butter. He wasn't going to have any sauce but I wanted to try the butter so he asked for it on the side. It was ok but the filet mignon tasted better on its own (which is how it should be). Tried a bite of my friend's gnocchi and thought it was very tender and pretty good. Not the best I've had like in an authentic Italian restaurant though.  Absolutely amazing service! Even though we had a late dinner reservation that was close to their closing time, we never once felt rushed. Our chairs were pulled out for us and when someone left the table, our napkins were still folded when we came back. Plates and drinks constantly refilled. The wine list is long so the waiter had the sommelier come by to assist in picking a bottle. The sommelier tried to sell the table a $2k bottle, even though we wanted a mid-range bottle so that wasn't to helpful initially. Ended up with a really good bottle though (I'm not a wine drinker and thought it was easy to drink).  Apparently this dinner (and one later in the weekend) got me nominated in picking all the Vegas meals in the future. Would definitely come back. Hopefully for HH next time. Want to try the marrow & escargot!",

    "text": "My bf and I were excited to try Bardot for dinner based on pictures I had seen in IG and review on here.  We were even more thrilled to find out it was by Michael Mina.    We started with the escargots and foie gras terrine.  The escargots were prepared different from what I am used to and were beautifully presented.  IMO I think the escargot were a tad dry and chewy based on the cooking method.  The foie gras terrine was rich, creamy and just perfect.  It went very well with the crusty bread.    For our entree, we split the bone-in rib-eye with the horseradish creme, side of mac and cheese and mushrooms.  The rib eye was cooked perfectly and had a nice crust.  I love the look of the mac and cheese which tasted like an adult updated version of the blue box from our childhood.  The mac and cheese was extremely salty for my taste which was too bad.    Our meal was delicious and our server was very nice and sweet.  But as the meal progressed, she was non-existent.  She came back to check on us once and we never saw her again.  When my bf went to the restroom, waitstaff stopped by our table a couple of times but never picked up the empty dishes nor did they fold his napkin.  This is what I would expect.    Overall, I might come back to Bardot.  With all the competition Las Vegas has to offer, I feel they really need to step it up in the service dept.",

Next time on to the more adventurous drinks with egg whites! :O  The duck l'orange was a good appetizer but also felt like eating high-class wings, which I guess is what we were doing. The French onion soup did not disappoint in taste or wads of cheese. And the mushroom gnocchi was fancy in presentation and taste.

    "text": "What a wonderful discovery!  We went to Bardot's for our anniversary and had an amazing experience.  Bardot is located in Aria, but you can easily avoid having to deal with any Strip traffic by coming into City Center from Harmon and parking at the North Valet (we are locals and weekend traffic on the Strip is about as much fun as having your tonsils removed with a grapefruit spoon).  Bardot's is on the 2nd level promenade, so no casino noise or flashing lights, just a nice relaxed restaurant area fronted by a very cool lounge.  From the series of small tables sitting outside, to the interior decor, it feels very authentic...reminded me very much of Brasserie du Louvre and this time I didn't have to sound like Quasimodo trying to speak French.  We were greeted warmly and once seated we were presented with an anniversary greeting card, with a handwritten message welcoming us for our special night, signed by all the wait staff...it was such a nice touch and really kicked the night off perfectly.  The wine list is quite extensive, including the by the glass section and in addition to the expected selection of French wines, it was nice to see some old favorites from California.  We started off with half a dozen oysters...it was our anniversary after all  ;-)   My wife ordered the King Crab crepe as her main (she's little and fills up fast) and since my favorite French meal is still Moule Frites, I sort of created my own dish by ordering Mussels Marinieres and added the pommes salardaises...three words....Stu-Pen-Dous!!!  The oysters were excellent, very fresh, briny and good...I preferred the West coast to the East coast.  My wife's crepe was rich, savory and incredibly flavorful...each element was there, the rich flavor of crab, the nuttiness of the mushroom the amazing creamy sauce all set off in a buckwheat crepe.  My mussels were perfect...yeah, I work out...okay, so my muscles are a bit old and tired compared to what they are serving up at Bardots, but you get the idea.  The mussels were all perfectly cooked, plump and bursting with flavor and the sauce was a little slice of buttery garlic heaven!  There was plenty to soak up my fries before plucking out a mussel to combine for the perfect bite!  The mussels come with one of Bardot's French Baguettes, which honestly could be its own food group, and the sauce that was left over after my french fry dipping was quickly devoured with the amazing bread.  If plate licking were acceptable, it would have been on! When it came time for dessert, we opted for the \"Frozen Paris Brest\"...mainly because I wanted to be able to order a Brest out loud and not get smacked for it!  It came out displayed on a plate which read Happy Anniversary in chocolate writing...a very nice touch!  The dessert, like everything else we had was amazing, flavorful and absolutely irresistible...hazelnut, chocolate and this amazing salted caramel!   My only suggestion for Bardots would be to give the Sommelier a few assistants, she was very knowledgeable about her craft, but she shouldn't also have to be in charge of pouring every glass of wine...Yes, I'm a lush and it pains me to see an empty wine glass. All in all a wonderful evening at an amazing restaurant...we will definitely be back!",

But I should have known once they sat us at a crummy table and I observed they had two large functions going on on both sides of restaurant (one of which was right near our table) it was going to be a rough one.  Our waiter was so preoccupied prepping the large room across from our table by mere  8 ft that we were a distraction and/or a nuisance. Here are your menus.  Here's your wine list. I'll be back in 15 minutes.  We finally ordered our drinks and they didn't show up for 16 minutes after that.  They were made but the waiter was too busy with preparing for big group to give a damn.  By this time I was starving so I had to wave him down just to order their bread with special French butter ($5).  After that I just observed him setting places in the big room.  10 minutes later I got the attention of another waiter to get us the included bread and house butter (which was better than the $5 dollar one).  We finally ordered.  The food was excellent.  I had the sole and my husband had the scallops.  Perfectly prepared.  We flagged our waiter down as soon as we could for check because the conference group had arrived in the big room with their badges around their necks and drinks in hand.  We could not hear ourselves think.  Why did they sit us their when I reserved through Open Table and marked it was our first visit their?  They knew what group was coming in!  As we waited and waited to get our waiter's attention because he was so busy opening up wine bottles and pouring glasses for people in the big room, I observed the same hostess trying to give another three top the crappy table location next to us.  They were smart enough to observe and see the cluster f that was occurring and asked for one of the booths that were completely empty.  They were denied!  I guess there was a group who reserved those booths already?  So they got slotted almost back into the bar area at a table.  Are you kidding me?  Why on earth they even opened to the public that evening is beyond me.  I see restaurants in Vegas all the time posting \"closed for a private function\".  Ok you want to be open to the public while hosting two big groups?  Then prepare for them with staff accordingly!  Restaurant management 101.  Oh, btw, completely overpriced.  Even the best steak places in Vegas do NOT charge $69 for an 8oz filet!  If you have prices like that please match with stellar service.  Wasn't even asked if we wanted another round of drinks.  Such a bummer.  Great chefs, poorly trained management.",

If anyone tells you that pink is not right in pork. Then you are WRONG! Slight pink is perfect on a pork ! it was tender and juicy. The fish was amazing. I would recommend this little spot on a date night. No date..That's fine too! Small groups will enjoy it as much!",

    "text": "I have extremely low expectations for restaurants on the strip.  I feel as though they can get away with more and have less to prove being \"on the strip.\"   However this was not the case with Bardot.  I was invited last minute to go to brunch with a few old friends, and although I was hesitant, I was SO happy I went!   Bardot is located in the Aria, which is already a beautiful (non-smoking, so yay) and pleasant place.  Self-parking *which was not painful* and valet is available for guests and it's a short walk through the casino and up to the second floor for Bardot.   The ambiance was lovely, although the music didn't go with the vibe of the restaurant.  The menu was pretty, laid out nicely and offered many different selections. We started with the boulange basket, with assorted sweet breads -- made me miss Paris.   For brunch, my friend and I decided to split both the salmon croissant benedicts and the french toast.  Both were AMAZING -- the french toast was a large puffed (looked like honey toast) piece of toast and sweet, but not too rich.  The almond syrup it came with was over the top.....I thought the toast was perfect on it's own, thank goodness it was on the side.   The salmon croissant benedict was absolutely mouth-watering. The salmon was cooked perfectly and each bite melted in your mouth.  I was sad when I came down to my last bite.    Staff was extremely friendly and attentive, my glass of water was never empty, so that deserves a  huge thumbs up.   Only downfall was no outside seating, but that's understandable. I will definitely go again.",

I see the lack of a gluten-free menu as a front of house problem because it puts an additional burden on the back of house.  Very limited menu.  The foie terrine was not to my taste. The pork chop was very undercooked. Unacceptable. You cannot serve undercooked pork to your guests. Instant one star.",

Was looking for a nice French restaurant without having to get to formally dressed (sorry it's 105 degrees so getting DH to not wear shorts was hard enough!). Server was friendly, informative and attentive without being in our face. Started with the oysters. Hubby is not a fan usually but he enjoyed them! Very fresh and clean tasting. I also had the Lime in Da Abricot cocktail which was nice and light and refreshing. Hubby had a French beer which he also enjoyed. For dinner I went with the duck breast which was HUGE but cooked perfectly. When I mean huge, it was obscenely huge! It could have easily served 2-3 adults. I'd hate to have met that duck in a dark alley alone! Hubby went with the Parisian Gnocchi which was fantastic! We did order a side of Brussel sprouts which were just ok. I don't think they were cooked quite long enough as they were a bit too tough for us to enjoy. It was creamy, rich, decadent and we just wanted it to go on and on! For dessert I had the apple tarte tatin and hubby had the Mille Feuille which was amazing!! Loved the decor and just about every little thing about this place. We will definitely be back next time we're in town!!",

Bartenders were great and I swear one of them looked like tennis legend John McEnroe!    We ordered four dishes to share:  Escargot in Puff Pastry: These were incredibly good - just four bite-sized pieces unfortunately.  You would never know you're eating snails, so definitely newbie friendly.  Smoked Salmon: This dish was an assemble-yourself project. Lots of slices of smoked salmon, a small loaf of bread, pre-sliced, avocado, and cream cheese. You basically make your own sandwich.  Pretty good - salmon was fresh, not \"fishy.\"    Hunters Waffle: This savory dish has two perfectly poached eggs and some really good shredded duck confit - almost a play on a conventional Benedict.    Seasonal Fruit Platter: A surprisingly good appetizer that could double as a healthy  dessert.  Buckwheat sugar-coated beignets, a cake-like side of yogurt parfait with nuts and a sweet crust, and an assortment of fresh fruit including grapes, pineapples, figs, strawberry, and passionfruit!  I liked the yogurt parfait the best - better than cheesecake!  Would definitely recommend this place for an early brunch or lunch!",

The bar was really pretty. Lots of accents of gold and marble.   Service:  4 stars. The waiters were nice and gave us his recommendations but he forgot an order and it came out later than everyone else's. However he did give us a complimentary salmon tartine dish so that was nice.   Food:  2 stars. Sadly... On our side of the table, none of us really liked our food. I mean it was good but it didn't blow us away. And for this price point I was really disappointed. I mean 15 dollars for soup... Had to be good right?  Nope... Didn't really enjoy it.  Between all of us we ordered basically 75% of the menu. We got all the appetizers, salads. Fish, pork chop, steak, mussels and gnocchi. Nothing was spectacular... Just ok.b I would say maybe the sea bass and the crab crepe were the best ones out of the bunch. Did not like the pate, bone marrow, froie grois, or pork chop.   I would come here for drinks next time because it really is a cute place. Then I would go somewhere else for food.",

The service is impeccable and the ambience is tasteful.   I went here for dinner with a colleague and we both enjoyed this restaurant very much. For drinks, I started with the Moscow Mule. It wasn't on the cocktail menu but the server assured me that they made it very well, and he was right. It was excellent. We then had a cab. for dinner, which was very good as well.   For appetizers, I was planning on getting the foie gras parfait based on the reviews, but the server explained that this was more of a mousse, and if I was looking for a real piece of foie gras, to get the seared foie gras lyonnaise. OMG, it was amazing. The lentils and the caramelized shallots were a perfect complement. We also got the tuna tartare, it was okay.   For dinner, I ordered the rack of lamb, medium rare. These were served over creamy polenta. It was amazing. The lamb chops were thick and juicy and cooked perfectly. Some of the best lamb chops I've had. Unfortunately, there really was no room for dessert.   This place is pricy, but the product that the provide is well worth it. An outstanding experience. I highly recommend it.",

The restaurant is decorated with beautiful Parisian decor that makes you feel like you're away from the crazy city that is Las Vegas. Everything from the bar to the kitchen is absolutely beautiful.  We started off with a glass of wine and the steak tartare. Yum! We honestly loved it so much, we almost had a second order.  When it came down to the entrees, I went for the Lobster and my fiance ordered the Lamb Rack. Beautiful presentation and best of all, it was delicious! I had a bite of the lamb rack and was instantly jealous of my fiance's order. My lobster was yummy too, however, the next time I am ordering the brandy cream on the side.   Finally, the server (who was excellent btw), insisted on dessert and coffee. We went straight for the giant chocolate macaroon (one word = HEAVEN) and had some cappuccinos. Absolutely delicious! The macaroon was perfection. I honestly could have had two more orders, if I wasn't so stuffed from everything else.  Overall, if you're looking for great service and a delicious meal, hit up BARDOT Brasserie.",

I asked them to recommend two appetizers - so they suggested the King Crab Crepe and the Foie Gras Parfait.  Excellent choices.  My favorite was the Crepe- it was so different.  The egg makes this dish shine.  They also suggested the Le Classique Steakburger.  This is only available at the bar.  Beef patty was all prime rib deliciousness.  It was so good, I could of ate another one.  The fries are fried in beef fat.  These fries were so awesome.  Every single French fry was crispy.  Next time I am back in Vegas I will come back.",

We then waited until 9:45 to be seated, so we did not start off on the right foot. Why make us wait? Then our server, Clementine, tried to upsell us on everything we ordered. Would you like to add fruit to that? Would you care for any extras with that? We know how to read a menu, Clementine, we don't need to be prompted to add items. This does not happen in other restaurants! I ordered coffee with heavy cream, and the cream was not delivered with the coffee. I had to flag down a busser to get the cream, and when it arrived, unbeknownst to me, it was steamed, and I burned my hand on the pitcher because I didn't know it was hot. My friend ordered a latte extra hot, and said that not only was it just mildly warm, but it was one of the worst lattes she'd ever had. She said it was undrinkable. The saving grace of the meal was the pastry basket. Two of the pastries, the canelli and the queen aman, were absolute perfection. But our main courses were just mediocre. My french herb omelette was lukewarm when it arrived, had nearly no cheese or herbs, and was basically just an egg. My salad had dressing on the top leaf only, I thought that was very odd. Were the other leaves supposed to be eaten sans dressing? We all agreed that the hype over this place was a lot bigger than the experience. Wouldn't really recommend, unless you go just for the pastry. But bring your own coffee!",

Waited almost 20-30 minutes until our waitress came to get our drink orders / pour us water. Had to request from a bus boy a menu. Unacceptable.  (2) Waitress did not ask us if we wanted bottle or tap water, immediately starting pouring Fiji water for our table of 6. Can get a little pricey for a thirsty party at $10/bottle! (3) We has a couple of diners with food allergies - waitress was not knowledgeable about the menu / substitutions and said she would inquire with the chef but never followed back up with us.  (4) Waitress did not check in with us during our dining experience - had to hunt her down to order anything or ask questions.   Disappointing experience overall. Would not recommend.",

The decor is very nice but the sound volume makes this an enjoyable place for a couple. There are large groups, bad acoustics and they pump music in the background that builds it up. The noise level is very loud. Also surprised to see a lady walk in with a bulldog on leash following her across the tile and she sits down at the table next to us so they should advertise being pet friendly. Considering the place sent me a text reminding me of their dress code I was surprised to have a dog sitting two feet from us while we tried to enjoy the dining. Maybe it was a French bulldog so it was allowed.  Service - While I went in with the mindset to not rush through dinner they took it to a new level. We had to order our first drinks from a manager who checked on us and went down from there.  Food - While the dishes were very good they didn't meet up to the hype and pricing (yes, I know it is Vegas). The pricing doesn't bother me it was that the dishes didn't rise to that level.  Overall, I take their stars down for atmosphere, definitely for service, food and the dog.",

For the food itself, it was good, but it didn't blow my mind. I ordered their sea bass based on a recommendation and again, good, but not sure I'd ever return specifically for that dish. I thought the lemon was a bit too overpowering. I did enjoy the cheese platter that we ordered though and their bread/butter is truly scrumptious! Their cocktails are also great. I think overall, I would definitely be back since the experience itself was lovely. I would just be sure to branch out and try something else the next time around.",

And it works every time, this visit being no different.   Bardot Brasserie is a spacious, elegant restaurant located inside the Aria Hotel. They attracted me with their great brunch menu consisting of appetizing light starters, nice cheese selection and vast choice of breakfast dishes. And wines :). After carefull consideration, my fiance and I decided to share a desk of cheese as a kind of starter. They serve it with fresh bread and house mustard, seasonal jam and candied nuts on the side. The whole selection was very good and the mix of flavours suited us very well. Next, we ordered famous Hunter's waffles and french toast with mascarpone and almonds. The former was good, but not as exceptional as we thought it would, but the later, mmm... tasted heavenly. Not too sweet, crunchy but soft, just enough almond. And it was really big, definitely too much for one small person. The service was very professional and friendly, our waiter gave us some great advice.   It's a shame we visited that place on our last day, as if I had known it earlier I would gladly eat there more than once.",

ESCARGOTS BARDOT is good but hunter's waffle and lobster croissant.  Let's start with lobster croissant, this dish doesn't keep up with the price I paid,$32. You expect the croissant to be crispy and buttery and when you put lobster on the top, a good chef should consider it might get soggy and try to do something about it. However, it didn't and you even can see watery croissant because of  water from lobster. Don't even mention about hunter's waffle, it tastes exactly like lobster croissant just changed the lobster to duck confit because the sauce they used is the same. It is like playing Lego you put stuffs you need and do nothing to balance the ingredient. I am very disappointed about their dishes and for price I paid, Bouchon at The Venetian is doing better than Bardot.",

    "text": "This has become my \"go to\" spot in Vegas. I usually stay at Aria or Vdara, which makes this restaurant really convenient, and really delicious. I've tried a lot of their menu items, and whats below is only what I can remember. They're also really easy to get a table last minute, which is great when you suck at planning, but still want a good meal.   The Excellent:  The wait staff is really friendly and accomodating. I always ask for ice in my water, which they don't do by default, but none the less they make sure to keep my glass full of ice. One of their staff members even turned me onto a place names San Sebastian in spain, and I visited there based purely on his recommendation, and I've been back twice since! Can't think him enough for that. Unfortunately I only saw him once, and when I asked for him on a return visit, they said he didn't work there any more.  No Dress code - I hate dress codes.  Beef Tartar - Oh man this is good stuff. Flavored well, and really delicious. They serve it with potato chips which is perfect.  Bone Marrow - oh man. I've had very few things in life that were this delicious.  Onion Soup - Get this. Seriously. You don't have a choice. I often get this as my entree, with the added beef, truffles, and egg on top.  Foie Gras Parfait - delicious stuff. Really rich though, so a little is enough.  Lamb Shanks - Oh man these unbelievably good. Perfectly cooked.  Crab Legs - They're good, and normally they'd be in the \"good\" column, but they peel the legs back for you, so they're super easy to eat, which puts them in the excellent column in my book.  Oysters - Delicious and fresh every time.  Scallops - Unbelievably tender, and flavorful. Amazing.  Beet Salad - Nice and refreshing salad, since everything else here is pretty heavy and bold.  The orange friend chicken - Delicious, and the butter sauce they serve with it is amazing.   The good:  The Mac and cheese - I usually order it, and I'm usually a little bit disapointed because EVERYTHING else is so good.. but this mac and cheese, while still good, is not as excellent as it could be. It's a little dry, and needs more cheese sauce. Surprisingly, it might be better reheated the next day.  Gnocchi - It was good, but not great. Kind of \"rubbery\", and needed more sauce.  Truffle Fries - They're really good, but I don't really get much \"truffle\" flavor from them.  Creme Brulet - Good, but not anything I haven't had anywhere else.  Snails - I found a picture of these on my phone, but I don't remember them, so they must not have been too spectacular, but I don't remember them being bad either.   The Bad:  The only bad thing I'd have to say about them is that I tried to get a last minute reservation for 20, and they were only able to accomodate us with a limited menu. hard to blame them, but I hate limited menus... Maybe it's not fair to put this in the \"bad\" column, but I have to have something :)",

    "text": "To be honest...my bf and I were thoroughly disturbed after what happened last night at the restaurant. Food was great and service was great however the incident completely ruined our dinner.  We were approached by a photographer who asked if we wanted our photo taken. We didn't think much of it and said sure. Then the photographer started having us do poses...still didn't think much of it although we thought it was a bit odd. Later at the end of dinner the photographer came back with a collage of our photos in an album. She set it down and said nothing to us and kept standing there...we were thoroughly confused as to why she kept standing there...so I took out a bill thinking she wanted a tip and as I handed it to her and at that point she finally spoke and she said its \"$145\" for the photos...We were both dumbfounded...if she had said something to us or explained the costs we would have considered possibly purchasing a photo but the whole situation made us feel uneasy.  Just shady...  We left immediately after dinner as we felt creeped out as now she had a full collage of our photos...everything was great for dinner but the situation totally ruined our night...",

    "text": "Ok, so I have had brunch here twice. Food was good. Service good but not friendly. I do have to complain about the bartenders. Both times went to get a drink first and the bar staff was so stuffy. This last Saturday night was the worst. The older gentleman who was at the bar around 6pm was just flat out rude. We ask to see the happy hour menu and he was reluctant to give it to us. We asked how is night was so far to try and warm him up but nothing. I know happy hour patrons may not be your favorite but they are still patrons. With everyone's stuffy attitudes we won't be back.m",
