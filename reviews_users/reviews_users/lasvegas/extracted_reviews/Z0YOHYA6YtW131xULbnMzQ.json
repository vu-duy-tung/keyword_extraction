Be prepared to wait. The cafe is pretty large, so they can seat quite a few people here.   The prices are quite cheap for many of the other items, so if you happen to have a stick in the mud in your party who doesn't want to try the soup, there are plenty of other inexpensive options. They aren't as good as the soup, but it's still pretty good for the price.  Definitely just what you're looking for in a soupy delight. I try to get it every time I'm downtown late at night.",

You can get rice, eggs, Portuguese sausage, corn beef hash, bacon, ham, etc.  It's pretty cheap, I think under $7 for all you can get.  You get to eat breakfast like the locals.  But this last time, I went and got the famous Oxtail Soup.  It's $10 but it's a large bowl.  And there is plenty of meat which is tender and tasty.  Good broth too.  Now that I've tried it, I know what people are talking about.  If you are craving a good soup, come here.  I am debating whether to go buffet or soup next time.  The staff is friendly, you're at the California Hotel where most Hawaii people come to stay and they try to make it a local feel here.  Prices are reasonable and portions are good.    Overall I enjoy my experience here each time, it's the place I eat when I'm in this part of old downtown.",

The soup was a little too salty, otherwise a great meal for a pesky 10 dollars. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the NY strip steak deal on the graveyard menu was underpriced for the quality of the meat coming in at a staggering $6.99, I spend more than that for a snack at Jack in the Crack.

Oxtail soup is a generous portion for only $9.99!  I think there was about 4 large bones with plenty of meat and a side of rice.  Super tender meats and the broth is yummy.  The banana fritters is a good dessert...fried banana wonton like items, with icecream and fresh bananas....and some caramel type drizzle!  Very good, and it's only about $3-4.  Service is lacking here...you'll get your order quickly, but almost every time we are here, the servers aren't very friendly, don't offer refills, and are not very personable.  So minus one star...but still a great spot to hit late night!  Give it a go!  It's worth the haste of parking downtown :)",

With that said, do not expect help if your missing utensils or have a question or request or something. Don't expect to be offered desserts also. It doesn't matter if the food is great in this place, you'll definitely lose your appetite in her bad service ! We come here a lot and definitely the worst experience that we had !",

Eggs, bacon, Portuguese sausage, rice, potatoes, fruit, etc. It's good for what you pay for and fills you up.  The best part about this restaurant is the oxtail soup. The soup has huge pieces of oxtail, broth, carrots, and celery and you can add ginger and cilantro too. And they give you a bowl of rice too. They only serve it from 11:00 PM - 9:00 AM so keep that in mind. Also, the soup is super popular so the line can get long around midnight. I recommend getting there a little before 11:00 PM and getting in line and seated right at 11:00.",

I was charged $10 for parking on NYE, so I KNOW I didn't go all the way out here for bad food, especially the attitude that the old hag at the parking lot!   I'm a huge stuffer, so I ordered the California Ham & Eggs and the much-hyped Oxtail Soup.  The Cali Ham & Eggs meal came with potatoes and toast. Maybe because I'm not from California, but the ham was a no-go for me. It was too dry and not tender at all, but the rest of the meal was great. I loved the eggs and the toast.   And now finally on to the Oxtail soup. Tastes like momma's Thanksgiving stew or her various soups. Just the right amount of salt and everything, and you know oxtails don't come cheap!   The waiters are really nice, and even though they've mistaken an order on my bill, they took responsibility. Great place. When I come back soon, I'd love to try the other food on the menu.",

    "text": "My friend has been raving about this place, specifically the oxtail soup...so we decided to make a stop at midnight. Make sure you call in advance just in case. They start serving at 11pm, but I guess they have ran out before. You don't want to make the trip all the way out there for nothing.  Location/ambience: dive cafe located in a grungy Asian-dominated hotel in downtown. A type of place I would go for a specific dish and that would probably be it. I could totally see this place in Triple D.  Service: lots of older Asian servers. Pretty friendly. Our service was fast   Apparently the wait could be really long on some night. No complaints today.  Food: the server knew right away what we were after. 5 oxtail soups. We also threw in a NY steak plate since it was only $6.99. Soup came out with. 5-10 mins. Good size portion with 3-4 big fatty pieces of oxtail. Also comes with 1 big scoop of rice and side of cilantro and ginger. The soup base flavor was delicious. I love how the cilantro and ginger favors accompanied it. There were some veggies included. Once u dump the rice in, it becomes a very hearty stew. The oxtail was a tad tougher than I would have liked. I wonder if we had come in the early morning, would it have been more tender (longer cooking time). It also got s tad messy trying to extract the meat from the bone. But the flavor was just so good. Every bite was delicious. You definitely get food coma after. The NY STeak was just ok. But for $7! How can u complain.  Value: I thought was excellent. $10 for this dish in Vegas is good and worth it.   I kinda wish that this place was closer...but then again they would be charging $19.99 for it. I would definitely return.",

As you walk through the casino, you notice that the clientele is primarily Asian and many of the men are wearing Aloha shirts.  Our favorite dishes are the oxtail stew and the miso butterfish.  There were 8 pieces of oxtail in a delicious tomato based sauce served in a large bowl.  You get a small cup of rice with your order.  At $7.95, this is a bargain.  This is on their daily specials menu only available on Tuesdays and Thursdays.    The miso butterfish was moist and delicious.  You get a 1 inch thick piece of butterfish with your choice of potatoes or rice with some steamed veggies.  Hard to find butterfish, but it's offered here for $10.95.  Service is prompt and efficient.  The waitresses are so friendly with the Aloha spirit. There are great choices for food in Vegas, but the market Street Cafe is a great choice for some down home Asian dishes.",

    "text": "It's crazy but I've been going to Market street cafe for decades. Literally I remember going here when I went with the family to Vegas as a child. I've eaten here every Vegas trip that I can remember and while the food isn't the best I still look forward going to eat at the breakfast buffet.  Parking: Unlike most Vegas hotels you actually need to get validation  Atmosphere: Nothing special here other then the hordes of Hawaii people ready to gamble. Your standard Diner feel  Service: Since 90% of the customers are most likely staying at the Cal and most likely have food vouchers that come with the Hawaii package then mostly everyone is eating for free. That tends to make waiters work a bit less then what you would expect at a normal restaurant. Watch out because at times there can be long lines & waits of 20+ mins. Do yourself a favor and sit at the counter where you don't have to wait.  Also watch out for shift change times(10:30-11pm) service can really really drag then.  Prices: Like most restaurants in Vegas the prices are pretty good. Expect to pay about 5-8$ for most meals.  I particularly like going for the breakfast buffet for the best value. Sure you'll find some typical Hawaii food items(Portuguese Sausage!!) but for $6+ you can't beat it. Also be sure to look out for the late night NY steak which can be a good bargain  Food: So you get what you pay for, nothing is going to \"wow\" in the Market Street Cafe but you should be more than satisfied if you're staying at the hotel and want to get a bite to eat. If you're not staying at the hotel and maybe you want to get some food that you might find in Hawaii then it's also a great spot. Just be sure to befriend a hotel guest and ask them to spot you some meal coupons.  Conclusion: The Market Street cafe has been a staple of Hawaii residents for decades and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Just don't expect  5* food and expect 1* service(unless you stick with the buffet).  If you're in town and want a bit of Aloha go check it out.",

Surprisingly their chinese chicken salad had a lot of meat and their sauce was amazing. I was surprised that I was so full from just the salad itself. The ambiance is really nice. Although you have to wait 10 minutes, it's worth it for their delicious specials!",

    "text": "This place is known for their late night oxtail special, so after a long flight that came in late, that is what we went straight for. The busers serve you drinks and guess what, mine was not paying attention when he put my water cup down and it spilled ALL over me. WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS, ARLENE! Luckily, I had already put my Louis bag on another chair and was not wearing anything expensive. A supervisor came by to ask if I was okay, and I just said that I was fine and that it was just water. Of course, spilling a drink on someone is unacceptable and that set my mood for Market Street Cafe for the rest of the trip. Unfortunately for me, I was staying at the Cal and had meal vouchers for this 24 hour restaurant.  On to the food. The oxtail was NOT the absolute best thing I have ever had. Yes, it was fall off the bone soft, but it was so fatty. Plus, the ends were dark colored as if it is old meat. The soup is salty and they skimp on the vegetables. Also, for all the mess that we make eating the dish, I wish they would provide an extra small bowl for the bones. I like how they put the ginger and cilantro on the side so we can add it to our taste liking, plus I prefer no cilantro at all.  My favorite time to eat here is breakfast. Do not get their prime rib scramble since it is probably leftovers from the night prior. I like the made to order omelettes but my absolute fave is the Philippine breakfast. It comes with tocino! The busers in the morning come around frequently to refill coffee, but never asks to refill my orange juice. My last morning they tell me that it does not come with free refills. Well that was my first time hearing of that, and if my cup is empty, why wouldn't you even offer regardless of charge. Stay consistent people. I have gotten free refills on OJ before! I do not care about the charge. I just want to stay hydrated in the 101 degree weather!  Lines are long, especially at 11pm when the oxtail special starts, but it moves fairly quickly. The vouchers do not cover everything. For example, oxtail is a dinner voucher plus $2. Sometimes they apply less than $2 to your meal and you pay the balance. It's confusing. I probably would not eat here if I did not have to, even after my welcome bath!",

    "text": "Other than ox-tail soup and the banana fritters, this place is meh.  But oxtail is the only reason why you should go here and a good reason no doubt.  Part of the reason why this place gets such high reviews is the history and experience of this cafe slaving and serving Ox Tail soup 7 days a week from 11pm-on.  In a group of 12 people, there were only 2 people in our group who FAILED and ordered non-Oxtail.  Why would you eat anything else?  I've been about a dozen times and have tasted the other foods and am never impressed.  It's either Oxtail or nothing.  Also seems like the price has increased - I remember it being 7-8 bucks but the demand is clearly there with lines forming well before 11pm.",

    "text": "This place is a definitie must add to your late night facade.  After the clubs, I usually drive down here for their grave yard specials.  I think they have Loco Moco for like $5 or $6.99, oxtail soup for $8.99, steak and mashers for $4.99 (which come with long beans or you can substitute the whole thing for fries, my personal favorite! chicken fingers and fries (with the choice of honey ranch or regular ranch, I recommend the honey ranch. It's soooooo delish.) and sausage and pancakes for around $3 to $4.  Come on a Weds night, they usually don't have a crowd and graveyard starts around 12.  You might want to avoid coming on the weekend, it's hella hectic with people.    The taste for the oxtail soup (if you're from Hawaii) isn't all that great, so don't expect to much out of it.  It's nothing like the flavor in Hawaii, but it's a mock imitation.  The service here isn't too bad, my friends ordered our food 5 mins and our food came out within 10 to 15 mins.  On a busy night though, be prepared.  It'd take a long time for your order to be placed.  But the servers are nice, and sometimes when you're lucky you might get a local server from Hawaii. Now those people, are a character.  They always never fail to remind me of home. ^_^",

First off, it was disgustingly salty as if we put a spoon full of salt in our mouths. Second of all, it was obvious that you went to a lower grade meat. I do NOT call this slab of meat Prime Rib. It was like some nasty slab of meat that could not even be cut w a knife. All of the people in our party agreed. We complained to the waiter who then told us we were not the first people to complain that night and that many others complained as well. What did he do? He took the prime rib off our bill and charged us for \"all you can eat salad bar\" that came with the prime rib. Whoop di do!! Prime rib is $9.99, all you can eat salad bar is just a few dollars less. I've been getting your prime rib every year for the past 10 years and it's obvious this is NOT the same grade of meat, it honestly tasted like Ass.  I gave stars because the ox tail soup reminds outstanding. The mahi mahi was still outstanding as well.  A big fat zero to no longer having daily specials we could use our Hawaiian Package coupons on where Vacations Hawaii advertises \"free meals.\" These are all gone. Now, coupons only can be used for breakfast and saimin. Boo!  Customers notice when you cut costs like this.",

Nice selection of Island food witch makes sense since the California seems to have a niche with that particular community.

You get a generous portions of ox tail in the soup with veggies, finely minced ginger, and a scoop of cilantro.  You also get a big scoop of rice. I'm usually too full from just the ox tail and soup, i don't even touch the rice.   Another favorite after hours meal is the LocoMoco - hawaiian favorite of rice with two eggs, meat patty, and gravy.  Those are the only two items I've tried here, so this review goes to them.   Giving it 4 stars because although the soup is only $10, you need to take a $25 cab ride from the strip to get to the restaurant.  And that means about $50 for round trip. So make sure you gamble a little before you leave to try to earn that cab fare back!",

    "text": "We were thankful to find this 24-hour operation after a heavy gambling sesh.  The name is deceiving, though it does offer all day breakfast - there are many Hawaiian items on the menu. Most likely because, being located in the California Hotel, it caters to the heavy Hawaiian tourist clientele.    Upon arrival, we were dismayed that there was a long line wrapped along the entire corridor and our hopes were dwindling as the staff was counting off how many parties in each group and it seemed so out of reach that we'd be able to eat in this century.   Alas, we saw the light at the end of the tunnel and was able to get seating right by the entryway.  Not everything on the menu is offered at all times. However, they have this lovely section on the menu, labeled under \"Graveyard Specials\" (11 pm to 9 am) where we got a NY Steak for $6.99! I ordered the Oriental Soup Combo ($7.29).  Now, I know you're probably wondering what quality of meat do you get for $6.99. Turns out, something overcooked and tough, with texture resembling muscle fibers.  In hindsight, we should have probably ask for it to be prepared Medium instead of Medium well, tis' bad 3 am judgement.  But looking on the bright side, it came with a side of fries and warmed frozen green beans, so it was salvageable(?).  I had high hopes for the Saimin wonton soup. The noodles were slurpy and cooked perfectly, the broth was savory and warmed my soul, having sold it to the blackjack dealer earlier. The wontons were tasty morsels with hearty filling, however the wrapper had been soaked too long and fell apart in my bowl. The char sui was gummy, and inedible. The medium sized shrimp was appealing, but unsure if I could trust the crustacean, I passed on consuming it. Loved the fresh spinach in the soup, and ate some of the fish cake, but I've never been a fan of the artificial coloring of the fish cakes, even when I lived in Japan so, left some of those too.  I think I'd come back and maybe try their other menu items as I do love Hawaiian food.",

They have been raving about this place for the longest time, so when I finally got a chance to take a trip out to Vegas, I most definitely had to try out this place! You get such a huge portion. It's a big bowl of broth with about 5 or 6 pieces of oxtail in it and comes with a small side of rice. They provide some ginger and cilantro to add to your soup, & don't for get to ask for the chilli paste for a little bit of kick! The oxtails are so tender. I had to ditch the chopsticks and spoon, used my hands instead. Honestly, one of the best meals to end my night from a full day of drinking and walking around. Don't forget the floss because I had meat suck all in my teeth after this meal haha!  I also shared an order of short ribs with my friends. Very very good. Great portion size but I felt like the sauce on it was a little too sweet for me. Overall, this is a great place to get a bite to eat. They have late night meal specials that are very cheap. Service isn't the best but the food kind of just makes up for it all.",

Ok, it's not too bad\". Then finally, I ate everything together with the fall-off-the-bone tender meat with rice and I'm like \"Holy Moly! This is so bomb!\" When we finished our bowl, my boyfriend and I both wished we had gotten our own.   Besides the oxtail soup, we did order corn beef hash that came with hash brown and eggs. The corn beef hash was actually pretty delicious and perhaps one of best I've tasted. What I really liked about it was the crispy outside. Breakfast is all day, which is nice. I never mind having breakfast for dinner.   We did get to the restaurant before 11 p.m. We were surprised to see a long line. Lucky for us, they were seating groups of 2 so we didn't have to wait too long in that line. Service was quick and efficient. Prices aren't too bad either.",

From 4pm - 10 pm, they also have a $10 prime rib special. The special comes with a choice of soup or salad bar (I would recommend the unlimited salad bar), prime rib, string beans, a choice of a bake potato or rice, and a cherry jubilee. Their salad bar has many options to ranging from regular salads to mac salad and toppings.  On Fridays one of their specials is ox tail stew. It is amazing. It reminds me of back home. Sauce was amazing and there are still big pieces of ox tail. This is one of my favorite dishes there.",

On my last night in Vegas )': and staying at the Cal, I really really really wanted the prime rib special. I rushed down last minute from the hotel room after debating in my head if I should try to beat the deadline for it. I had maybe about 15-10 minutes. I settled on \"go for broke\" (Haha) I explained my urgency for this entree to the hosts at the stand. I waited a bit, then a hostess got me a table for one.  After being seated, my server dropped off my beverage and went to tend to other tables in her section. After a bit, I scanned for my server on the floor... I got more and more anxious as the minutes ticked by and the chances of getting the prime rib special dwindled... I finally flagged down a male server and asked if he could put in my order. I explained my desperate situation. He did. And I got my prime rib special :D   I was very thankful for the actions of this older Asian male server who made it possible for me to enjoy my last meal in Vegas. I didn't catch his name but I'm very appreciative.",

I'm being honest, not hot at all. Lucky if you can call it warm. I don't know what going on but they just lost another faithful customer. I heard Fremont is much better. Next time Fremont for sure.",

Another thing I remember is how long they take to seat you, and today still the same.    I'm from Hawaii, and obviously this place caters to Hawaiians given their menu choices are those you can find on this islands.  Food is okay if you are hungry, but nothing really to boast about.   I recall years back ordering different dishes and didn't quite care for it and thought I wouldn't care to return.  This time around, heard they sell Zippy's famous chili, given I do like Zippy's chili, this is all I ever order from here.  Outrageously GIANT PORTION of Zippy's chili served for one person, I believe is enough for 2 people to get full from.  The Zippy's chili is one of the items available at no charge if using your meal coupon given with the Boyd's Travel Packages.    One of many restaurants that does honor the Boyd's travel meal coupon.  Oh, and open 24/7!",

Then places the napkins down and the silverware. She then returns to wipe our table and has the rag and napkins and silverware in the same hand and in the other hand has a black platter. We ask her if we can have a whole new set of napkins and silverware. She smacked her lips at us rolled her eyes and said \"Ma'am this is clean I just rinsed it.\" We we're upset by the attitude and asked her to just replace it.   After That incident our waitress took our orders came by once to check on us and we never got refills on our drinks. Very poor service. Very rude staff.

The broth just had a beautiful blend of flavors which went well with the rice. I honestly could just eat the soup with rice and be satisfied. The actual oxtail was so soft and tender, the meat just fell right off the bone. I loved every bite of it! The short rib dish was also so yummy, I loved the sauce on the ribs. It wasn't your traditional bbq rib sauce. The macaroni salad, which is a common Hawaiian dish, was also great! The downside about this place is that it doesn't open until 11pm so plan to be out late if you try this place! I forgot to mention the service, it was great. Our water was always full in a timely manner which is something I appreciate when it comes to restaurants!",

    "text": "Woohoo!!  As good as it gets!!  Market Street Cafe is labeled as a Hawaiian Restaurant, but also offers a ton of other eats.  Let's just get it out of the way right now...OXTAIL SOUP!!  I have no clue why I am even reviewing it since almost every Yelper on here has given enough details on how good it is. I just would hate to over-hype it for anyone.  Bottom line, you have to try their Oxtail Soup yourself.  My only wish is that it was serviced on a plate full of rice.    Market Street's portions are huge and the prices definitely cheap.  I recently had a full pound of their NY Steak Strip for about $12.  Not the best steak in the world, but good enough.  Back to their Oxtail, hooked up for sure. Enough to serve the average two people.  But I always seem to kill it on my own.   Couple of Tips: -Oxtail is only served after 11 PM.  This could have changed by now, but I never take the risk and just make sure I'm in after 11 PM.    -The line is long, but not as long as it looks.  If you're a single or party of 2, doesn't take long at all.  If you're a party of 4+, can take at least 15 minutes.  Also there's no wait if you're sitting at the kitchen bar.   -Daily Specials: Review their board for their daily specials.  Believe me, some great deals there.  1/2 lb NY Steak for $5.99 is a steal!!",

    "text": "Welcome to the hotel california!!! Market Street cafe is located in this iconic (and locals only it feels like) hotel. My mom and I needed dinner ASAP right after our flight and everyone on our plane and shuttle was raving about the oxtail soup.   Walked in around 1130 and was still able to order it so don't be discouraged! The wait for parties 2+ seemed a bit longer since we were led to a table right away.   Service was pretty mediocre, it took 10 minutes before someone even greeted us and another 5 just to order. Also if you're used to drinking fresh water in Hawaii I beg of you not to drink the water here!!! I thought people were over exaggerating when they said it tasted like pool water but seriously... it 1000% does, yuck. My throat still feels nasty.  The oxtail soup had a massive amount of tender, fatty oxtail compared to Hawaii where it's so expensive and you only get a few pieces. The soup was average and the veggies weren't cooked cooked long enough, bummer for all you mushy veggie lovers like myself! The cost definitely outweighs all the cons - only $10 for this huge bowl of awesomeness.  Perfect dish to regain energy and warmth :)  All in all its a great bang for your buck, not sure if I'll I'll be coming back since there's so many other unique restaurants to try in Vegas. But if you're in the mood for something familiar and comforting (all my Hawaii peeps) I recommend this place!",

    "text": "While most of our trip to Vegas had been plotted, my buddies and I were left to plan our bar hopping adventure while everyone else went clubbing.  With so many bars and hotels in the area though, we figured we would just wing it and see where the alcohol took us.  The one thing we knew for sure though was our last stop of the night - Market Street Cafe's famous ox tail soup!  Now I know - when it comes to post drinking/clubbing food, the usual suspects that come to mind are classics like burgers, pizza, and burritos.  But ox tail soup?  A little unexpected...much like the line!  Parked in a corner of the California Hotel casino, it was pretty surprising to see so many other people there.  I guess that just shows how popular they are for late night eats.    The roughly 20 minutes it took for the three of us to get a table seemed agonizingly long since we were so hungry, but the wait was worth it.  None of us really had any expectations, but we all thought it was pretty solid (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pd2Xo1WqNic9zxLTVdilGA?select=nkKSBXcNq1bxA1jC_6wCZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pd2X...</a>).  The meat tasted great and it was oh so tender - so easy to pull it off the bone!  The broth was flavorful despite being on the lighter side, but I thought it could have used a little more richness to it.  Still, not too bad as it was.  The rest of the menu looked decent from what I saw, and I especially liked how it offers so many island/Hawaiian dishes (they have saimin!).  Definitely a good late night food option, but it's a shame that it's not closer to the Strip!  Then again, if it was, the lines would just be that much longer...",

The broth had plenty of flavor, the meat was tender and fell right off the bone. The Chicken Fried Steak  was simple, nothing to \"wow\" over, but it definitely hit the spot for me.

You get the salad bar or soup, choice of potato, veggie, prime rib and cherries jubilee for dessert.   The salad bar definitely caters to their Hawaiian and Asian customers which is very unique. The baked potato was nicely done and came with butter and sour cream.  The green beans were mush and inedible but my expectations were pretty low because this is typical for this caliber of restaurant.  The biggest disappointment was the prime rib.  I got mine medium rare and my husband got his done rare.  They were cooked to the correct temp; however, the meat was devoid of flavor and was very fatty.  The beef rind was bland and I actually needed to add salt and horseradish to make it edible.    If you want big portions for a great price then definitely eat the prime rib dinner here.  However, if you want better flavor with less food at the same price I recommend Magnolia's at the Four Queens.  For $10 you only get prime rib, potato choice and mushy veggies but the prime rib quality is light years better.",

There will be days that you'll have great customer service and there will be days that you will not have good customer service, there will be days your food is amazing and there will not be days where your food is amazing - inconsistent.   Food is an 8/10 just because each time I have ordered it was delicious. Their late night specials start at 11pm, which is the time I usually go and it's most of the time good. Their steak and eggs plate, prime rib, etc. Their fountain drinks are free refills but not heir juices (you pay per can.)  Customer services is a hit or miss. Sometimes you'll have an amazing server who is very attentive. But most times when I came here with my grandparents we have received rude service or servers who lack attention to customers. Sometimes we only see our server three times: when they take our order, when they deliver our food, and when they give us our checks. It is such a hard time to call upon other servers to ask for to-go boxes, a refill, or a correction on a mistake on your food. Due to the fact that my grandparents visit Vegas and come to Market Street because it is a part of their vacation package we have been experiencing this for the past five years. I have witnessed servers sigh and roll their eyes at my grandparents when they get confused about menu items, this has frustrated me overtime. We'd take our business elsewhere but Market Street is way too convenient and for some other customers are the only option because they have it on their vacation package they pre-paid for.  Good food, bleh service.",

I think the best thing about Market Street Cafe is the convenience.  It's located in the California Hotel and Casino where many locals from Hawaii stay and the food they serve is really familiar to us.  My personal preference is not to eat foods that remind me of home while on vacation.  However, so many of my friends and co-workers insisted that their oxtail soup is a must.    We decided to go there late one night when we needed a break from the slot machines and gosh darn it, the line was ridiculously long.  It was about 3 am and the line wrapped around 3 times in the normal lobby/waiting area.  They weren't exactly taking customers in the order they came in but in the order which it was most convenient to seat certain amounts of people in your party.  If a table for 4 opened up, they would take the next party in line that had 4 people and so forth.    When we finally got seated, we ordered the Oxtail soup and the Loco Moco.  Both portions were pretty huge, which was a plus but like I said, I've had better.  I wasn't completely blown away by the food and the service was alright, they didn't exceed my expectations or anything.  I might go back if I'm dying to eat a really big and satisfying meal at 3 am but it for sure wouldn't be my first choice.",

    "text": "First time staying at California Hotel (for a family reunion of sorts). Ate at the plate lunch place upstairs before but never at Market Street Cafe. Mom told us about the oxtail soup here, so we decided we would eat there at some point. After gambling till 2:30 am we thought we would stop by. Place is pretty busy even at that time. Didn't think I would be able to eat too much since we had a large buffet dinner earlier.  Boy was I wrong! So I am from Hawaii and have had my fair share of oxtail soup, but this one was pretty damn good! Must order EXTRA ginger and cilantro! And throw the bowl of rice that comes with it into the soup!  There was quite a bit of oxtail inside. Ono till the last drop! Now whenever I go back there I will probably never order anything else as long as the oxtail soup is on the menu (11pm to 9am, I believe)!",

They have good soul food here.  It's American food, but with a Hawaiian and Filipino twist.  They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner items 24 hours!  Everything is good.  The only thing I wish they changed is the Portuguese luncheon meat.  I very much prefer Spam with eggs and rice.  If you're in town and staying downtown, this place is a must try.  If you are partying downtown and need a late night fix, this place will definitely serve your appetite.  The prices are not bad either.  My friends and I order like 2-3 entrees each when we come out here for a late night fix.  We'll set them all down and eat family style.  We came here Friday night after a night of drinking and dancing at Beauty Bar down the street on 7th.  We ordered the following items: omelets, tocino eggs and rice, chili and rice, oxtail soup, french toast, side of bacon (which is an entire platter full), luncheon meat, eggs, and rice, and saimin soup.  There is a variety to choose from, but these are the ones we order on a regular.  Everything was good!  You will not be disappointed!",

While it can't compete in size or variety with many of the larger Vegas buffets, this place served really yummy food.  Pretty much everything I tasted was delicious (OK not the cheese blintzes, but so what?).  The real draw was the price - we paid less than $6 a head!  Nothing wrong with that!  The service staff was attentive and friendly, the place was clean.  All in all a good experience.",

The so I sit down and tell the server that I wanted to order takeout. She tells another server that I wanted to order takeout and I am ignored for the next 20 min. If ur servers don't want to take take out orders just say so... the food is cheap that's about all this place has going for it do yourself a favor and just order pizza.",

    "text": "Trekking to the fringe of downtown Vegas is worth it to get my Tocino fix. It always seems to be a quick ride though. Could it be because it's 2am with no traffic or because I'm in an alcohol induced coma? Standing in line is the best  for people watching. You've got families, rough necks, elderly couples, drunk chicks wearing 300 dollar shoes, random gamblers and lurkers. I feel so comfortable there and never fails to shake out the cobwebs before the gastronomic adventures that await. Ok, an overstatement, but when you're drunk it can be an adventure of some sort.  Already had the Tocino on my mind, but so much hype about the Oxtail Soup got me curious. The server arrived to put down place settings and water and I started to ask her about it just as I read her name badge. Let me rephrase: I \"attempted\" to read her name badge. What I saw was a collection of letters, heavy on the vowel count and in a configuration I have not seen before. Trying to blink my eyes back into focus and reboot the brain cells that got short circuited from trying to process her name was time enough for Server X to bounce. I let it go for the moment and planned to ask her about it upon her return. The food arrived. Delicious comfort food was just what I needed. I didn't see purple on the menu, but would have been sooo good. Distracted by all that was going on at the table Server X slipped my mind. When the busboy came to clear the table I asked him, \"Hey, that girl that set the table for us, what's her name?\" Dude was pretty tall and when I asked he stood upright and stared out into the distance. From the low viewing angle I could still see the blank look on his face. Awkward silence ensued. A good 10 seconds passed before he responded: \"I don't know.\" with shame in his eyes. WTF... then, \"Nobody knows how to pronounce her name.\" And he quickly bounced. She never returned. Laughlin sucks.  I'll be back to find you mystery Server. I got an extra Yelp star with your name on it... Well, it will, once I figure out what the hell it is.",

That includes the famous oxtail soup. When you go there take a look at what people are ordering. It's about 90% oxtail soup. Get the hint? So if your craving something late at night and can't think of what to eat. Just go drive yourself to downtown Las Vegas and get a bowl. Put some of that crushed ginger, little bit of cilantro, and ask for some chili paste (if you like hot stuff). Soup comes with rice and don't even think your not getting full. Believe me you will be happy you did.....  For those not adventurous enough or don't care about soup. They can get a NY steak, chicken tenders, or waffles,eggs,sausage/bacon combo for $4. Again these are the graveyard specials only.",

The Market Street Cafe is located in the California Hotel. My friends and I ubered down to Downtown from the strip, but there is also parking available in the hotel if you drive. If you eat at the restaurant, you can get free validation at the front desk.   We got there around 6 pm, and the line was pretty long. However, it moved fast and we only had to wait around 20-30 minutes for a table (although the cashier had told me it would take five). When we got seated, there were a bunch of empty tables so I wish that they would've seated us sooner, seeing all that empty space.   The food menu is extensive and has a lot of Hawaii-local foods. They have daily specials that change from day to day. And it is basically great for every type of meal! We came for dinner - so I decided to try their Friday Special, Oxtail Stew. If you are a fan of beef stew, definitely try their Oxtail Stew! The service size is huge - it comes with four or five oxtails. Even better, it was only around $9! The meat really tender and cooked well. It also comes with a side of rice. Definitely a must try for dinner!  The service was great, and I'd definitely come back again and again. I can't wait to try their oxtail soup the next time I'm in Vegas!",

Since people been raving about the oxtail soup, I HAD to try it for myself. Also, because I was super hungry going in I ordered the Filipino breakkies.   Oxtail soup - HUGE PORTION!!! Definitely sharable in my opinion. They give you a little side of ginger and cilantro to add to the already seemingly flavorful broth and a small bowl of white rice. I accidentally dumped the whole container of cilantro into my bowl before I could even try the broth so I can't say if there was any difference, sadly. Hence, me saying \"seemingly flavorful\" broth. The meat was so fall off the bone. It makes you wonder how many pots they got goin on in the kitchen to get them allllll to be that way. The meat was also super fatty! Like REALLY fatty. I ate some but not all of the fatty goodness because I was too scared to eat anymore of it. I wish I had an even bigger stomach to be able to fully enjoy the soup!!  Filipino breakfast - comes with rice, eggs your way, tocino, and a nice little cup of fried garlic. Hearty portion and very typical Filipino breakfast. The tocino was nice and fatty just the way I like it. All it needed was some vinegar!!   Fair warning! I came in on a Thursday night and there was a line to get in. It moved along quickly but I heard the weekends are horrible! So definitely get in line early before the graveyard specials start. Otherwise be doomed to stand in a long line with other oxtail soup craving tummies.",

We always get our food fast and fresh! It's in California Hotel, you have to pay for parking in their structure and they don't validate. Ask for lemon for your water, cuz you'll need to drink it. All the food taste great! But you know they use salt. It's a must stop at least once, to check it off the list or who knows... you might come back!",

The waitress suggested the island short rib and I was a bit apprehensive because I'm not a big meat eater, but when on vacation, all rules go out the window.    I'm glad i took her recommendation because the meat was soooo soft. It fell right off the bone and the sauce made it even better.  It came with veggies and I asked for brown rice.  The Mac salad was okay, but who cares because the short rib was thick and juicy.  I felt a little guilty eating this, but it was all worth it.  It made me feel like I was at home eating an awesome local plate lunch.  The customer service was great and I'm glad the waitress made that recommendation because i was going to opt for the tocino (which I had later in the week and it was blah).",

I also realize that maybe you won't have the best staff everywhere you venture to. With that said, I'm updating my review because I've eaten there a few more times.  I decided to order off of the menu for breakfast this time. I was pleasantly surprised that the hash browns were actually better & I felt tastier compared to the buffet line. The eggs were also a lot better.   The French Toast was also rather delicious. The thick cut bread satisfied my breakfast craving, and it was tasty, so plusses all around for that.  All in all, a much better food experience compared to before.",

Otherwise, the line can be out of the door and pretty long.  I ordered the short beef rib and was not what I expecting as I was expecting the Korean type which is thin, but this one is like a real rib.  Still pretty good and you get vegetables, not fancy, but it will do. The macaroni  salad was just okay.  The oxtail soup was great as they were not cheap on the meat and way cheaper than going to a sit down restaurant.  The food is premade and comes out really quick.",

    "text": "Market Street Cafe is located on the ground casino floor of the California Hotel. They're also open pretty late too! We ate here around 1-2am for a late dinner after a night gambling.   Their menu is pretty extensive, but some of their entrees come straight from Hawaii! Definitely a must for locals. I'll include this in my California Hotel review, but most of their guests are from Hawaii. The restaurant itself has that local vibe to it.   Onto our dinner. We ordered the Wonton Min, Korean Short Ribs and the Chop Steak. The Wonton Min's broth was so delicious it reminded me of home. For me there's saimin from Hawaii and then there's the traditional Japanese Ramen. Unless you're from Hawaii, it's really difficult to find that local tasting broth. It's difficult to explain so I do apologize but you'll just have to try it for yourself! Now with the Korean Short ribs, I was expecting thing cuts of ribs, like Kalbi for example. However on this plate was a thick, tender, piece of short ribs. Literally the meat fell off the bone and it was flavored so well. Lastly with the chop steak, I wasn't expecting much. However, it was simply delicious. Sure the meat didn't feel like a prime piece of steak, but it was tender and the taste of the sauce with rice and macaroni salad mixed so well together. The texture of bell peppers, onions and celery was also very satisfying.   If you're a night owl and ever having the munchies, visit the Market Street Cafe!",

You are in very good company, too, if you ever see the line to get in around 9 or 10 AM on any given day.  The hosts and wait staff have been there forever and they're all incredibly friendly and provide wonderful service.  Prices here are ridiculously cheap, too.  In 2018 the breakfast buffet is less than $7.    *However*, as others have said here and everywhere else, you get what you pay for.  The family agrees with me, but they go anyway cuz you can't beat FREE (they had lots of credits).  The food, including the buffet, is so massively unhealthy and mediocre.  My relatives ordered the California 2 eggs over medium with rice, wheat toast and Portuguese sausage every day so I followed suit one day.  Whoa.  I think that took a day off my lifespan!  I tried the buffet another day.  It doesn't offer any toast or bread options.  Just anemic looking hash browns, reconstituted scrambled eggs, a number of fatty meat selections, fruit and pastries.  I had to fill up on eggs, a few pieces of Pocho sausage and steal some of my family's toast.  Also tried the garden vegetable omelet which was okay and (surprise) saw I posted a pic of it before on a previous visit - lol - so I guess I've tried it before, too.  The waitress takes a double take if you tell her you don't want any potatoes or rice with it.  That was funny.",

When it came out, it was served with cilantro and grated ginger + rice on the side. We also asked for lime for those who wants to cut that grease a little.  The portions were generous with 4-5 pieces of ox tail, the soup was flavorful and had a lot of potential if it was just less salty and hotter. The carrots  was a bit too firm, but overall it was a good soup and I didn't expect this at a diner in the middle of a casino in downtown. I guess it is Hawaiian . I really recommend it for drunk people, it hits the spot.  Also be patient! Service is slow and understaffed.",

For years I've heard about the oxtail soup (served 11pm-9am) and how great it is. Well, it's not. Not even close. Wasn't tender at all. I had to pry at it with my fork to get it off the bone. Heck, I make a better oxtail soup than that! I was pretty bummed since I was really looking forward to it. And not only that, the rice was really dry too. Come on, man. Maybe it was an off night since it was busy but consistency is key, right?   Yeah I get it, it's late night so most people don't really care about the quality of food they just want something to fill them up. But I'm not most people so...  Points for having an extensive menu and being open late (and early obviously). The Philippine breakfast was good, so there's that. But the service kinda sucks. The wait isn't too long considering how busy it is. But once seated, you have to flag down your server for everything otherwise they won't come back to your table other than to bring your check. Not sure what all the fuss is about. Sorry fellow ninth islanders. This place just didn't do it for me.",

    "text": "I HOPE SOMEONE WILL TAKE TIME READING MY LONG REVIEW. I am writing this review not about the food that they served but the humiliation that we experienced from them. Here's the story: After we played at Bellagio's casino at 3am, on our way home, we got hungry and drove here for their OXTAIL SOUP which I guess is the popular late night menu that this restaurant serves. There were still a long line when we arrived, it's the holiday weekend, so it's expected I guess. While we were still in line, their receptionist shouted that there's no more OXTAIL SOUP. We decided to still stay and eat there since we were hungry. We ordered what's available in the menu. My cousin who ordered beef short rib complained that her dish is very salty, and it is really too salty, can't even eat it. The server said they will give her same dish with the sauce on the side this time, my cousin agreed. The short rib that they served the second time is still very salty. I guess it's the marinade they used that made it salty. So my cousin called the server again and told her that it's still salty. The server took the plate and left. Then she came back with our bill and told us she didn't charged my cousin's order. Duh, they should not of course because she didn't even eat it.  The server's act of not asking my cousin to order for different food again and giving us the bill while we are just starting to eat and we didn't even ask for the bill yet is VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. The server should have asked my cousin if she wants to order a different food instead and not just taking out her plate and giving us the bill as if they want us out of there, my cousin didn't even eat yet and they're giving our bill already?!?!?My cousin was even so polite when she told the server about her food. I ask my cousin if she wants to order other food in the menu but she already lost her appetite. So, after we ate, we head out and stopped by the cashier at the entrance to pay for our bill. Our bill costs about $80+. After that, we left the restaurant. While we were just few meters away from the restaurant, one of their server was running after us shouting \"hey, hey you didn't pay your bill!\" We stopped and looked back to see who she's running after. To our surprise, it was us. Then there is another staff running towards us too. Then this server again named DOLORES told us again waving a receipt in her hand, in front of a lot of people in the casino, \"you didn't pay your bill!\". I asked her \"what bill? We just came from the cashier and paid our bill.\" She showed us a bill for an order of 2 OXTAIL SOUP worth $20+. I told her that's not even our bill, in the first place, we didn't order any oxtail soup because they said they don't have it anymore right? She told us to come back to the cashier. We walked back to the cashier and I was so mad already, I told her asked the cashier coz we just came there few minutes ago. The other staff check the receipt that DOLORES was holding and told her there's a mistake. The receipt she's holding is even from 1am transaction. We came there at 3am! The staff apoligized to us. I told them that what they did was so unacceptable. We felt so humiliated that people might think we are running out without paying our bill. There's so many people around the casino and in the line that saw what happened. If only it's not almost 5am and we were very tired, I should've called the manager and talk to him/her. But we need to go home so we just left. NEVER AGAIN I WILL EAT IN THIS PLACE!",

    "text": "I don't really know how it happened, but this place is a must for Hawaii locals when coming to The Cal.  If you're eating from 11:00PM-1:00AM, be prepared to wait in a long line for a table. What is everyone coming for that late? The oxtail soup, of course! It's only served from 11:00PM-9:00AM(?), and people will wait for it! It's especially busy on the nights the Vacation Hawaii groups come in, so watch out for that. The oxtail comes out in droves, and it arrives at your table nice and hot. The meat is so tender, and the broth so flavorful, that you can't help but like it. While it is good, and soup is always great late at night, it's not something I'll always order. If anything, we'll get one bowl and share it between 4 of us, and order something else.  Some other things I like to eat here:  Island Style Shortribs, Philippine Breakfast, and the cheap breakfast buffet. They also have Hawaiian Sun Guava Juice, expensive, but still good!  The real drawback though is the inconsistency in service. When it's busy, I'll get my food quickly. When it's slow, I'm in the restaurant for over an hour. Sometimes it's ok, and the waiters won't forget anything. Sometimes they'll forget about us altogether. It's because of this that I dropped them to 3 stars. Hopefully, this will be something they'll work on, because it's convenient to eat here when you're staying at The Cal.",

Overall, for $9.99 the Oxtail soup was a good inexpensive late dinner or early breakfast.",

Throw it all in there with some soy sauce - amazing. So delicious. The meat is tender and falls right off the bone.   Seated at 10:30, no line, and said we would wait until 11:00pm for the oxtail. Other tables around us had the same idea. Our waitress went ahead and took our order in advance and we were served couple mins earlier than 11.  Amazing food. I still dream about.",

It was a Wednesday night, and it wasn't busy at all.  We got seated and ordered right away.  The salad bar is nice, they had neptune salad available, as well as potato salad and some cole slaw.  The prime rib that came out was exactly what you'd expect for $9.99.  It also came with your choice of sides so I opted for the string beans and some french fries while my parents took the baked potato.  There was a lot of fat on the prime rib- I would say about 30% of it was fat.  The meat portions were pretty good for this kind of diner.  The dessert probably looked the most appetizing out of the whole meal however.  I think this was a one time try, but I probably won't be back anytime in the future.",

Came with salad bar or soup. Salad bar was ok weird though celery and carrots were not chopped or shredded but was ok to create a big dinner salad nothing fancy looked like they had tofu. This was really good for the price. I saw on yelp sirloin steak special on Sunday but wasn't on the menu anymore as pictured from yelp photos.

Such a great meal after a night of drinking and gambling. The broth is surprisingly light in flavor considering how fatty the oxtail is. And there's also bits of celery and carrots in the soup (you gotta have your veggies!) and is served with a side of white rice.  BUT if you thought the $9.99 Oxtail soup is a deal, come back in the morning (aka, a few hours later) for their breakfast buffet for $6.25! Portuguese sausage, corned beef hash (the canned kind), rice, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy and MORE! It's all my favorite breakfast items.. i felt right at home.   So for great food and service with a feeling of eating a home cooked meal, come to the California - you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "In the past few years, I have visited place countless times and each visit leaves something to be desired. A typical diner open 24 hours with mainly Hawaiian dish.   SERVICE Many of the workers here have +10 years of experience in the service industry. Experienced, yet it's the same ole task they do everyday so customer service is rusted, if that makes any sense. Not much attention to detail and constant waving down for them is a must.   FOOD Rule #1 here is always order their water with lemon. Water here has a strong chlorine taste. Otherwise, order their diluted coffee or sodas.   When I say I have visited this place countless times, I mean +100 times over the years. I have tried almost everything on the menu. They have daily specials that are $8.99. Salad bar is good choice if you come in around the time their breakfast buffet ends (11 am) because that's when they switch the breakfast buffet with fresh salads.  My favorite and probably the most ordered dish is their prime rib. Comes with choice of white rice, brown rice, cole slaw,  baked/mashed potato, french fries along with green beans out of frozen package that you can find at any grocery stores. It comes with a dessert at the end, which is their vanilla ice cream. I ask for their prime rib to be cooked medium rare and comes out perfectly 90% of the time. They have multiple chefs there and some will cook your rare medium prime rib to well done.   I also like their beef teriyaki plate. I like the flavor, albeit too savory for my liking. Beef used for this is always cooked to perfection. It's a small portion.  Chinese chicken salad is another one of my favorite. You can't really mess up on this but I appreciate that this is a big portion. Keep in mind this is always made freshly to order so it will take 15-20mins to prepare.  Oxtail soup. I personally am not a fan, but my company enjoys this dish a lot. Served 11pm to 9am and is a huge portion. It's one of the most popular dish here.   CONCLUSION As many other yelper states, come here for the oxtail soup or prime rib. Other stuff is mediocre.",

Seriously! It's a freaking steal!!!  -- their T-bone steak dinner is, simply put, not bad at all. Great price at $15.99.  -- fish and chips, TASTY!!! Freshly fried and sides are plentiful.  -- they really have upped their game in terms of getting through that crazy ass line of patrons and their quality of service. I've never stayed in the California until this past Christmas, and we were consistently impressed with everything once again. Servers are sweethearts!

After driving 5 hours from San Diego to Las Vegas, I make a stop to eat oxtail before I do anything else.  They only serve it around 11pm -9am.  You get a big bowl of several oxtail bones in broth, with carrots, celery, peanuts and chinese mushrooms.  It comes with 2 scoops of steamed rice and a little ground ginger and minced cilantro which you add to your soup once you get it.  Kinda like adding basil leaves and bean sprouts in your bowl of pho.  On weekend nights, the line is 20-30 mintues long depending on when you get there.  It's worth the wait.",

The other entree I had was the mahi tempura: ono, steak and eggs: a bomb, saimin and burger: awesome just like home, the egg omelets: good: depends on your add-ons.  Now the bad part, I was there on my last day on the 6st between the hours of 0830=0900 am. The person behind the counter that takes the orders (not the drink servers) had an bad attitude that morning and I think a few days ago as well. I think she needs a break or relocate to a less demanding customer services position. So I figured she was having a bad day whereby we all have them but again when I went to pay my bill at the register, another lady looked like she got runned over or burnt out or even depressed. I asked the lady next to me \"everyone is having a bad day this morning\" and she nodded yes. I think she needs to be relocated to another work site like the kitchen. She have me my change and left irritated. Some workers needs to remember about who pays them and good customer service is a must even if you are having a bad day. I have no ill feeling with women but I do when you expect good service and you don't get it.  Overall, the food was excellent and affordable but the staff needs some reality check. A simple thank you and/or a smile if you are mute will do it.  So for the women 1 star! okay, maybe 2! I'm not that cruel. Four **** for the grinds though:)",

RE: oxtail stew the rice is aight... i admit that i am no carb whore like a lot of people out there, but the only way to really eat oxtail soup is with rice. mine wasnt as sticky as i would like. i am anti-peas and there were peas thrown on top of my stew... i have to say though, my my there were a lot of oxtail, but not enough of that dark brown marrowish stuff you find in the middle of the bone that you suck out (MMMM that shit is good)... i maneuvered around the peas and the oxtail was AIGHT... i havent eaten it in about 8 years, so i was good, but definitely not as good as my mamas.....",

Anyway, we now generally find our way to Magnolia's Veranda Cafe in the Four Queens, and while it's not dirt cheap, it's reasonable and the food is quite good, but like any place you visit it enough times and you long for change. After kicking around this place or the other, we settled on walking over to Sam Boyd's California Hotel and Casino to see what they had going on; all I can say is what a pleasant surprise Market Street Cafe was, remember we're talking about tasty/cheap \"after drinking food.\" I'd say if you want a great Downtown dinner, try the Grotto or Hugo's Cellar, but if you're staggering around and need to put food in your stomach and don't care about atmosphere and are thinking cheap, good food, Market Street Cafe is as far as you need to look.",

    "text": "alright..alright...the market street cafe at the california hotel is probably one of the best local and Hawaiian secrets here in las vegas.  for one thing there are hella Hawaiians in this place.  the cafe is your basic vegas 24 hour cafe.  it serves the typical steak and eggs, omelets, chicken finger, and house salad dishes...blah.  everybody here in vegas comes to eat here for the oxtail soup.  fricking hella good.  you can't get this anytime.  you have to wait till after 11pm to get this dish.  so i imagine this  stew with chunks of meaty oxtail, carrots, peanuts, and mushrooms simmering all day long till it gets served in a huge soup bowl with a couple scoops of rice on the side.   when you get this dish drop a couple of spoons of rice into the soup.  Then, pick your fork at the oxtail, the tender juicy meat just falls off so easily off the bone and plops back in the stew.  you then take the meat and dip it in this little dish filled with ginger and cilantro, but i take it to another level and squeeze some lemons onto the ginger with some Tabasco sauce to give it reggie's extra zing!!!!  this meal is totally cheap, and probably one of the best comfort food after a night of heavy drinking.  be warned, everybody around here knows about the oxtail soup.  when you get to the cafe around midnight, you'll notice a long line snaking out of the restaurant.  when you walk into the cafe, at each table you'll see at least one person with a bowl of oxtail soup.  YES....it's that good....",

    "text": "I rarely find an oxtail dish that I don't like, which leads me to think that when you hear \"best oxtail\" you are in for a treat. Lets hold our oxes just a minute and discuss the cuisine of these dishes. Jamaican, Vietnamese, Filipino, African, Hawaiian. Not a single one similar to any other. Not a single reviewer even mentions the varieties.  The oxtail served here is a late-night graveyard dish usually on Fridays after 11pm. That is when I came. It makes no mention of style, just accoutrements. When you look at the menu being decidedly Hawaiian you sort of assume that if it's not specific this is the default and it is. Compare it to the curry styles or the African style or Filipino kare kare and this doesn't hold a candle to them. This is not bad, in any way, but it is it's own thing. A latenight broth. It's clean, on the clear side, salted, but not rich in umami which makes me think it's made separate from the likely parboiling of the oxtail. Carrots, celery were floating, but I didn't get the usual mirepoix most beef stocks start with, lacked depth. Sure the cilantro and ginger helped, but they were merely aromatics and not flavor enhancers. The tail chunks were huge, meaty, fall off the bone, no gaminess. It's messy, but to clean them you gotta get in there. Rather than do rice I saw someone order a side of ramen, that would be better if there was more soup, I'll try that next time.   Philippine Breakfast was blah, tocino only, no longanisa, sunny side egg was good, rice was good, but not GFR. No tomatoes or basically anything else. The bacon side was huge, the sausage side was portugese and not Filipino or American, though it was clean profile.   Steak & Eggs were hit and miss, 2 medium rare's and 1 was cooked correctly, the other medium well-well. That got sent back. I understand it's harder with these thin steaks, but we know it can be done. Even the correctly cooked one was a little tough. Eggs were good. Sour dough bread was ok, even better with a heavy spread of butter. Their latenight side offerings are limited and they don't readily substitute/accommodate.   Service is ok, they only serve alcohol from a casino server so that takes time. The service is usually packed at night and they are a little understaffed making refills an issue. Decor is meh, seats are not uncomfortable, smaller party sizes generally get seated faster or try the counter. Lots of people get theirs to go.  It's an ok spot with some good dishes, but certainly not the best Hawaiian food, Oxtail or service around. I'll give them the latenight and large menu, but if your most famous dish is that inconsistent and mediocre I gotta be just real close, late and real hungry. I'd recommend to anyone wanted lots of oxtail meat in a broth, not a stew that isn't Jamaican, African, Filipino or Vietnamese because it's good Hawaiian oxtail, but wouldn't last in richer seas. If you want Hawaiian food and it's before 3pm you are better off going to Aloha Kitchen off Decatur.",

Served with fresh crushed ginger, cilantro and 2 scoops of rice. I agree: best oxtail soup!   Also recommend their lau lau special (served after 11am on Saturday) that comes with chicken long rice (glass noodles in ginger chicken broth), 2 scoops rice and mac salad.  Cheap breakfast buffet for $6.25 that comes with scrambled eggs, ham, portugese sausage, french toast, fruits, cottage cheese and coffee.

Comes with a side of rice too but I usually opt the rice. You add some red chili paste to it and BAM! heaven in your mouth. YUMMMM.   This place is usually pretty crowed during the late night specials. Lines form and it gets really long. Usually it moves pretty fast though if you don't have a large party.

    "text": "Located in The California Hotel, you'll find Market Street Cafe.  The Cal is a landmark for many Hawaii visitors and Market Street Cafe is the \"go to\" restaurant for the locals who now lives on the mainland.  Great selections of Hawaii style food but most importantly, this is where you get the famous \"Oxtail Soup.\"    The Oxtail Soup is offered only during certain hours so make sure you check the time before going there: 11PM - 9AM.  Talk about delicious \"ONO\" and mouth watering.  It hits the spot after a long night of drinking and dancing.    Keep in mind that the line is long so you might have to wait.  TIP: Sit at the bar stools for quicker service.  First come first serve.    Overall, the service can be slow but the servers are always nice.",

I noticed the carrots and celery were basically warm/under cooked. I think they ran out of the carrots and celery and didn't have time to cook it in the broth. So they scrambled to put some in and didn't allow enough time to cook. The broth and oxtail was plenty to provide extra energy for the late night activities.",

    "text": "Market Street Cafe is within the \"California Hotel\" so it was nice having a variety of restaurants to choose from while staying here at this hotel. Main Street Cafe offers lots to choose from, a variety of breakfast dishes, comfort foods, your usual eggs and pancakes, steaks, toast, and they even have filipino breakfast, say whaaattt. They have late night/early morning specials (the ox-tail soup which everyone loves), which cannot be ordered to-go, and some of them get sold out so you have to wait until the next day to try again.    We stayed at this hotel for 4 days and I'm pretty sure we could have eaten here every single day, if we wanted to, because there is such a vast selection of many different items to choose from without getting tired of eating the same thing. The breakfast buffet is delicious and reminiscent of a breakfast buffet at your typical Waikiki boutique hotel. Soft scrambled eggs, portugese sausage, white steamed rice, bacon, fruit, biscuits and gravy, and I love that their beverage choices include pineapple juice (although it is the teeny can that I can drink and finish in 2.5 seconds and makes me feel awkward when asking for another one... and another.. and another).   Plus everything on the menu is soooo affordable. Even the breakfast buffet. Any buffet below $9 automatically gets 5 stars because I love affordable food PLUS the food is actually good, which is a bonus at cheap buffet's, lol.   Love the food, love the affordability, love the casualness, love the look-and-feel of this place. Minus 1 star because their limited-time specials get sold out and I didn't get any ox-tail soup last time I visited. *sad face*",

    "text": "The typical late-night casino dining you crave after a long night of gambling or drinking.   FOOD: Oxtail Soup of course! A type of comfort food for me that pleases the taste buds and soothes the stomach. This dish is so popular here that the servers usually ask how many your table is ordering before they ask if you want anything else.  They have a pretty large menu that includes your typical diner food but also has a section that includes Hawaiian and Filipino dishes. Aside from the Oxtail Soup, everything else I've tried here has been pretty mediocre. I've tried the Steak & Eggs, Tocino & Eggs, Prime Rib, and Corned Beef Hash. All these dishes are nothing special and a little overpriced for what you're getting.   AMBIANCE: Good ole' old-school Vegas casino diner.. the only thing missing is the Keno screens. You'll find a lot of Hawaiian people taking breaks from gambling.. usually a quiet buzz from these zombies needing to refuel.   SERVICE: Pretty quick service, you're usually right in & out of there. A lot of times you'll run into a long line to get in but it usually goes by fast. The servers are always very friendly.. no matter how late into the night it is, they never lack politeness.   TIPS: Oxtail Soup! If you're dining at the Cal during the day, you'll find far better choices upstairs at Aloha Specialties.. but during after-hours, this spot is solid.",

Oxtail is a hit and miss here, comes with a side of rice. We always get the wonton mein here I love it!!!  Tonight i tried something different, The fried saimin it was a little bland.. It comes with shrimp and some vegetables.  I suggest putting some soy sauce in it to make it have some taste.  My boyfriend tried the patty melt. He said it was really good. So, if your craving a burger try the patty melt, it comes with fries. Everytime were here we are satifised for the most part.",

Our servers were Amada (not a typo lol) and Harley.  Amada was moving very slowly and deliberately without moving the top half of her body and she spoke very slowly.  She acted like she was high on pain medication or on the verge of a mental breakdown.  We asked her for napkins and she never brought them.   $22.68 got us a prime rib dinner, a fettuccine alfredo dinner with chicken, and two soft drinks.  Both of our dinners came with unlimited salad bar trips and my meal came with a cherries jubilee dessert.  The $10 prime rib dinner is an unbeatable deal based on the meat alone.  The prime rib was juicy and flavorful.  The rest of the meal was undoubtedly Sysco slop poured from a can.  The salad bar had iceberg lettuce and 10 different types of salad like your grandma makes...broccoli salad, coleslaw, seafood salad, etc. and canned peaches which my boy enjoyed.  This place was on par with elementary school cafeteria food or hospital food.  I'll never be back because of what happened when I tried to get my parking validated, but I'll save that for a review of the California.",

    "text": "After eating so much fatty food on the strip sometimes it's nice to eat something that resembles a nice home-cooked meal. That is exactly what the oxtail soup reminded me of: my grandma's cooking.  I liked it a lot, just like i enjoy my grandma's home cooking, but I guess since my grandma's spoils me so much the soup wasn't as spectacular as others have made it out to be.  They only serve it late night, so make sure you don't come here before 11pm if you want the oxtail soup.  The line, it seems, is usually long... but if you are not in a group you can request to be seated at the bar for little to no wait.  They don't serve drank at the bar, but you can grab one on the way and take it inside no problem.  That's what my girl and I did, grabbed a couple vodka tonics and sat at the bar around 10:45pm.  The minute it hit 11 we had two giant bowls of oxtail soup in front of us.    If I'm in the area I might go for it again, but honestly I don't think I would make the drive out just to eat.  The whole place has this feeling of melancholy and lost dreams.  It makes me think of people spending sleepless nights playing chasing those 3 bars smoking cigs til 4am on penny slots.  A lingering of a Vegas that used to be great, but is slowly becoming outdated.  It is something like traveling back in time, and while I like Fremont Street every time I visit it seems less and less interesting.  But great food and good times.",

We had to wait 5 minute intervals 3 times until I finally said, \"wait, we want to complete our order please!\"  Either I was super hungry or the food was just that easy and good. I devoured my meal and was satisfied.   Overall, the place needs better ventilation because it has a weird odor. The service is slow but the servers are nice.

I saw that \"oops\" look on that one server's face. She brought out my saimin and it had obviously been sitting there a while.  The broth had cooled down and the noodles were soggy. \"Sorry.  Sorry, sir.  We'll bring out your plate soon.\"  It was a good 10 minutes or so before he got it.  At least his food was freshly made.  :-/  I was determined to finally get a taste of the much-lauded soup.

However, I am rating them only 2 stars... because of my most recent visit here. So the lady that was coming around and bringing us water looked sweaty and not well. Well, what do you know...... after we finish our delicious meal, play a few games of Keno..... my boyfriend and I regurgitate everything we ate and was stuck on the toilet for the rest of the night and the next day. What a way to ruin our vacation. We weren't the only ones that ate there, my buddy, who went a little earlier said he started to feel sick too and ended up in the toilet all morning.  We lost one whole day because of this incident.... and for that, I had to minus stars.  FOOD: so they are known for their late night oxtail soup.... which is delicious. You can only get it after 11pm  COST: you can use your hotel or vacations Hawaii coupon vouchers here.  SERVICE: so our initial server was super nice.... it's just the water girl.... hey, if you're not feeling well, stay home! Especially when you are working in a food establishment!   LOCATION: near the west tower of the California Hotel  PARKING: the hotel has self parking or valet.  I forgot to take a photo of our food because we scarfed it down. However today I wish I hadn't.

I also order the Philippine breakfast which has a large portion of tocino, three eggs, and rice. The salty heartiness of this dish pairs perfectly with the oxtail soup. Both dishes come with a good amount of food so you definitely get what you pay for, if anything, you get more than what you pay for! This is a must for every time I visit Vegas and as long as they're still around, I will be back every single time.",

I ordered the island short rib plate and it was really good. I was expecting the typical thin cut Korean style short ribs but it comes as one big thick, bones in rib slathered in a teriyaki type sauce. Had it with white rice and it came with a side of green beans and Mac salad. The Mac salad was bland but the short rib plate is my new go to order for late night dinner. Nothing extra special here just good food in large portions at great prices.",

My girl has been raving about this and wishes to taste it without having a coma from alcohol lol. And for the first time and at last she finished it without falling asleep :) The ambiance is certainly have a Hawaiian/Filipino vibe in it because of the restaurant's set up. Their menu tell us either because of its delicacy. Our order is straight forward.. just order 2 oxtail soup and pig out! It came with white rice, which is common in any asian inspired dishes. The oxtail soup is super tender and its soup is the killer. It is so flavorful and yes it might have a lot of msg, but who cares as long as it is delicious and enjoyable. Overall, yeap I agree it is the best hangover food ever in my opinion so far :)",

The cashier's attitudes are still the same...RUDE!!!  I forgot to mention in my earlier post that a few of their wait staff are exceptional. There's Diopane, Didi, Donilo and DOC. They're quick, food gets to your table still hot, and above all they're sweet and always refilling your drinks. Always hustling!!!

Hamburger steak was tough and rubbery as well. 3 days later the nice and soft.  Salad bar at afternoon/evening are very limited basically only iceberg lettuce and whatever sides/toppings. No fresh spring mix spinach etc. Breakfast we are simple so it's been good. The breakfast buffet same for years fairly limited one day had fresh fruit bananas the next day didnt.

Only order the Graveyard Special Ox Tail soup. Order anything else on the side, but ALWAYS GET THE OX TAIL SOUP NO MATTER WHAT.   Believe me on #3. My husband ignored our group on his first visit, got a french dip sandwich, and spent the rest of time complaining about how disappointing it was. This after everyone told him over and over and over that his order had to be the soup. Guess what he's ordered almost every time since? Yep. He ordered a club sandwich last time. However, given that a club sandwich is on my list of \"things I know I can make easily but am still willing to pay for at a restaurant,\" I won't hold it against him.   If you visit at the stroke of midnight, expect a wait, Cinderella. The wait hasn't ever been too long, but if you're drunk or hungry, it will feel it. Now, assuming you order the soup, you won't wait long for food. It comes right out and gives instant satisfaction (AKA warm soup belly). The ox tail has never been anything but fall-off-the-bone tender and in plentiful portions. I've taken leftovers home at least twice because there was so much meat! The broth is great as is, but you can also add the cilantro and grated ginger that come with each order. For sure eat it with the accompanying side of rice.   Service is quick and attentive. Once you're done eating, you can take the check right to the exit and pay at the register.",

The waiter had told me someone had complain the broth to had no flavor and offer me a sample of the broth.  The broth did had flavor but not the flavor you get from cooking a lot of beef in a stock pot.  The broth was like just beef bouillon granules dissolved in hot water.  Maybe the liquid from cooking the ox tail was sold out during the night.  They did not throw away the water from cooking the ox tail, did they?  If so it would be a waste.  I still ordered it since I drove a long way to be here.  As other yelp reviewers said, there were a lot of ox tail and they were cooked to very tender and easily fall of the bone.  There was some fat wrapped around it but it can removed easily if you did not like the fat.  Overall, a good value for 11 dollars.  I could barely finished it and had to leave out half of the complimentary rice.  Ginger and cilantro were served with it.  Ox tail was also on Friday's dinner special. We also ordered the Oriental soup combo which was a combo noodle soup which was alright, though not as good as the one in Chinatown but good in a casino cafe. Overall, a decent cafe with a low price. Parking was 8 dollars so be sure to validate your parking ticket.",

When she finally made her way to our table, my sister-in-law ordered the infamous oxtail soup (now priced at $9.99), my brother ordered the wonton min, and I customized my omelette with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, bacon, & spam.  The food itself was okay.  Nothing to shout on rooftops about.  My omelette was okay, though the combination of spam and bacon made it super salty towards the end, since there were big clumps of them at the other end of my omelette.  The hash browns were okay.  Didn't taste the wonton min but my brother seemed to like it.  I did taste the infamous oxtail soup.  It comes with a cup of rice which my sister-in-law devoured.  The oxtail is cooked perfectly, with the meat falling off the bone easily.  The broth is pretty good but I suppose that since I am Filipino, I'm accustomed to eating oxtail with a peanut sauce (a dish called Kare-kare).  So although the oxtail and the broth was good separately, together, I was looking for something more.  I don't think I'd ever order it again.  Did I mention that our food arrived and we still had no drinks at our table.  When I flagged the waitress down and asked for water, she only brought one for me.  It wasn't until she noticed the shocked look on my brother's face that she made her way back with water for both my brother and sister-in-law as well.  Overall, I probably wouldn't eat here again, unless I had no other choice.",

    "text": "Located inside the Californian at old vegas this place is another spot to hit up if your looking to save $$$ on food. It's a 24hr cafe serving typical breakfast/burger type meals while offering diversity to the menu with their Ox tail soup, silogs, and $5 dollar steak specials. keep in mind they only serve the real cheap eats late night.  Myself I ordered up the Loco Moco. It came in large soup bowl with steamed rice, a beef patti (1/2lb), fried egg, and gravy. Giving you a heads up this meal is the reason for my write up. Compared to other joints they're making it happen flavor and quality wise better. Beef Patty tears into beefy chunks, the rice is steaming hot, and the gravy gives that depth of comfort your looking for when you eat Loco Moco Bruh! This meal is not gonna spare you on calories or sodium but if it's your last meal on earth then you went out like a soulja...Again not a chef but let me emphasize the gravy has character. I'm thinking it's stock based and possible butter if not drippings added for richness.  Other dishes sampled  Ox tail soup, just the broth for me tho. Warm, chinese spiced broth w/ hints of star anise. Chunks of carrot and celery to add sweetness and color. The broth is not served hot enough for me to order, I would need it to be piping hot. The Ox tail cuts served were on the large side. Noticed smaller cuts of Ox tails are usually more tender in most cases, my preference.  Pork tocino or tocilog. This was actually pretty good too. Chef grilled that sliced pork until it caramalized the way it outta to be. It's gets better, if your an eggs feign they serve the meal with 3 instead of 2! If your wondering what's Tocino it's marinated cured pork, usually thin sliced pork butt or possibly thick cut bacon. This should be approachable if your not into filipino food.  $5 Steak Special, 8oz grilled NY Steak strip with fries and string beans! If nothing above motivates you this might.  Not much too say about the decor of the cafe other than outdated. However, the place speaks for itself. It's easy to picture how it probably boomed back in the day. Looking at the staff they probably been here since. Service was not bad, the waiter kept an eye for us and filled up the water whenever needed. Friendly, nah, you can tell he just wanted to do his job and get out.  Parking is easy, ffree lot across the street, cafe is located on the ground floor, possible waiting time if your coming after hours  Check it out if you get a chance",

    "text": "Oxtail soup...oxtail soup...that's all I ever hear about is the oxtail soup.  And it's not just from the locals that are talking about it...it's from the native Hawaiians who are visiting or have relocated and all the other tourists talking about this infamous oxtail soup.    Served only after 11 pm until about 9 am or 11 am, you'll wait in line for a hour just to get a taste of it.  At $5.95 a bowl, you get two scoops of white rice, a few hearty chunks of oxtail and a light broth with carrots, peanuts and other good bits.  My favorite part - the ginger and cilantro mix they give you so you can toss all that shit right into your soup.  Yum!  And it's not a heavy dish...it's light and doesn't make you feel sick like typical late night fare does.  So, why only three stars then?  Well, because it's only served after 11 pm and I'm damn tired when I get there.  And the line is always so long!  (I waited an hour last night for this stuff!)  They need to hire more wait staff so they could open up all the tables in this restaurant and get us all seated faster.  Everyone is in line just for the soup and nothing else.  Just take a look around you and that's all you'll see.  They won't allow you to take this order to go, which is just as well because people like me would call in an order of twenty soups and they would never be able to put up with the supply and demand of that!  This hotel is located in the downtown area, away from all the glitz and glamor of new Vegas.  So, if you don't have a car, you're less likely to make your way down there.  After a heavy night of partying, you can only hope there's at least one sober and awake driver willing to take you to the California Hotel and stand in line with you for this soup.  And also, if I'm sick in bed or just want to be a brat, I can't beg or plead for my boyfriend to bring this soup home to me because he can't!  Damn!    The sad part about my first experience with this soup was that the broth was lukewarm.  This was disappointing.  When my sister and her husband ordered a second bowl, it came out piping hot, and what a difference!  I should have asked them to nuke mine a bit so I could have had that hot piping experience for sure!  Next time - I want it hot hot hot and another side helping of freshly grated ginger and cilantro please!  Update! 03/29/08 - Went back last night after a long hiatus and I think I'm done with their oxtail soup.  (I can make it better at home!)  The price went up!  So now it's $7.95!  The line was short when we got there on a Friday night way after 1 am.  Sure, there's TONS of people ordering up this stuff, but I spent the whole time digging my teeth into the oxtail trying to pull the meat off.  Patrons were watching as the oxtail slipped from my fingers and fell into my bowl of soup.  By the time we left, I was in some major need of floss!  (Maybe I've been spoiled 'cuz when I make it at home, the meat gingerly falls off.  No gnawing necessary!)  Update! 04/27/08 - Only went b/c my parents were craving the oxtail!  I had the Banana Fritters ($3.25), it came with four pieces of banana wrapped in wonton skins and deep fried, additional banana chunks, a side of caramel sauce, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with whipped cream on top.  The skin was way too thick on the deep-fried bananas.  The only saving grace was the caramel sauce and ice cream.   My dad had their $4.00 Half a Pound New York Steak, it came with vegetable, rice, fries, or mashed potatoes.  Not a bad deal for four dollars, huh?  Service - I never mentioned it before, but for the most part, the service is good.  The waitstaff are laid back and friendly, and a good bunch of people working here late at night.

Two guys got steak, one got the oxtail soup, while I got the BLT. The food took a bit longer than expected, but I liked what I got. Their saimin was apparently incredibly salty that night, so I guess be warned in case you plan on getting that. The steak was decent for being $4+, according to the guys. Really, you can't expect too much. The oxtail soup was really good, according to my friend, and from the broth that I tasted, I would have to agree with him. It's apparently what they are known for.  There are so many different things on the menu, I'd have to come back and check them out. The chili with rice is calling out to me.",

    "text": "So, exploring downtown Las Vegas with my family, we checked out this buffet because it had ox tail soup AND was open 24 hours. mostly because it had ox tail soup, haha.  I opted for the 4 dollar (it may have been cheaper, haha) steak. I HAD to order it, it was so CHEAP. But now i see WHY it's so cheap. Unfortunately, the last few steaks that i've ordered have been from Ruth's Chris, Maestro's, and Donovans. So I HAVE to say (and this shouldn't be surprising) that I was disappointed. I like at least 1/3 of my steak was straight up ligaments. I spent at least 10 minutes chewing one bite. My jaw was hurting after 30 minutes (aka after three bites). So i  ate the veggies (green beans). They tasted like they were microwaved. So then I stuck to my rice. No one can ruin steamed rice. Or can they? (just kidding, the rice was fine).  I feel bad giving a low rating, because shouldn't you expect such CHEAP food to not taste good? Whatever, my food experience just wasn't a good one. Plus, we waited at least 30 minutes in line before we were even seated.   But hey, if you CHOOSE to go here, just stick with the ox tail soup, my family loved it!",

The broth tastes very good with carots, celery and peanuts. The five spice is very prominent in this soup. They also serve this with a side of grated ginger and chopped cilantro for you to add to the broth.   It use to be about $6, but now it's at about $8; still well worth the money. The times have changed. It is available from 11pm to 11am now. Another dish I like is the Prime Rib dinner. Can't beat it for around $8. Simply tender, medium-well cut...delicious! Lately, I tried the Breakfast Buffet and I wasn't really impressed with it, but it was okay. I'll stick to what I originally fell in love with...Their Oxtail Soup!",

Now, before you write off their salad bar as some Sizzlers knock-off let it be known that they have TAKUAN ROLLS there!  Yes, TAKUAN!  Which for most non-Japanese people means yellow stinky radish which they wouldn't touch with a ten foot chopstick.  But for me it means a great start to an awesome dinner!  Their Prime Rib is SOOOO good!  I always get it rare and they have never never never overcooked it in the jillions of times I've eaten it.  It always comes out a lovely red color with juice spilling out everywhere and the fat is the best part----it just melts in your mouth!

After driving for 8 hours and getting there on Friday night, I was too tired to wait till 11pm for the Oxtail soup, so we went anyway to see what was on the menu.  I was happy to find Oxtail stew as one of the specials, so I ordered that. My s/o ordered the butterfish plate. Being of the Caucasian persuasian from Texas, I asked her if she knew what butterfish was. Not wanting to seem unlocal, she assured me that she knew what it was.   So I asked her if she was sure she wanted it with a baked potato. She thought about it for a second and said, \" Maybe I should get the rice.\" I told her it might taste better with rice.  The watress assured her that the butterfish was \"ONO\", I was thinking more like \"oh, no\"   In like less than 5 minutes we get our dinners, the oxtail stew was lukewarm and the meat did not fall off the bone. It tasted ok, but being served lukewarm was a downer.  My s/o takes a bite, looks at the butterfish and tells me, its a little different than what she remembered. I tasted it and told her, tastes like butterfish to me, then she tells me, \"Oh I was thinking moonfish\"  Oh, well... because she didn't like her dinner I never got the chance to go back for a late night Oxtail soup run. It'll have to wait till next time.",

The oxtail soup, wonton min, reuben, $4 NY steak, and cal burgers are winners.  Hawaiian sun drinks all the way over here?  Its like a dream come True.  Keep in mind that even in the wee hours of the morning you might run into your neighbor or your friend's parents from back home so no act so buss that they're gonna talk stink about you when they get home.  Seating takes a damn long time and service can be excruciatingly slow.  Only a skeleton crew runs the place during third shift so they get slammed out of their wits by all the hungry Hawaiians.

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday at 2 pm. There was one party in front of us waiting in line. We were waiting about 4 min for a restaurant that wasn't really full. Maybe because the hostess was by herself and sat people in the back of the restaurant. I was starving and thirsty so I noticed this a lot more. We were seated and had our waitress come up and give us menus. Another woman came by and took our drink orders. She seemed nice and helpful. Our waitress was a bit standoffish and seemed grumpy.  I ordered the saimin because it reminded me of home and I haven't had it for a while because I live in South Carolina. The saimin was a huge amount for the cheap price. It didn't have much flavor to the broth so I added a lot of shoyu and mustard. It came with wontons in it that wasn't mentioned on the menu because I figured you would only get them if you ordered the wonton min. It could have been better but it was just got enough to settle my craving for Hawaii food. I wish Their laulau special was on Sunday instead of Thursday. That would have been a better treat. Overall a good restaurant for the price. The service was ok but could have been better. And the saimin needed a bit more flavor.",

And perfect timing that after watching Celine Dion concert, there's a restaurant still open at midnight. This restaurant opens 11:00p.m. to 9:00a.m....so amazing!!! Though the line was pretty long and it took few minutes to wait before seated....but guaranteed worth it.  All foods were great! We ordered a lot because we were five by that time. Do you know what more amazing and surprising? We paid only $56 for 5 persons with take out orders already in that bill. No wonder that this restaurant really popular. We will keep coming back here everytime we visit Las Vegas.",

We always stay at the strip, but we would still make that drive and beeline to the market cafe hoping there's not a long queue which is very very rare.  This is not the nicest looking place, but it has its merits. That famous oxtail soup is certainly delish. Didn't think I'd be a fan, but it's perfect for cold nights and how appropriate they serve it from 11pm-9am when you would do anything to satiate your cravings in Vegas. All those times, the said soup is consistently good. I don't know where else to get em so I have no comparison but no need to bother. It's the only thing we order and have no complaints.  After that soup quest, it's worth a stop at Fremont outside and marvel at old school Vegas...",

    "text": "I remember coming here when I was a little kid with my family, and  the food was very good.  Fast forward 20+ years and I decided to take my family here.  I looked at the reviews on yelp and everyone seemed to rave about the oxtail soup.   We arrived around 10 PM tonight, and met \"Maria\" our hostess.  Man....she must of been having a bad day because she did not smile once when she greeted us, and seemed like she didn't want to be at work.  Not a good first impression for customers.    Well we finally get seated and the first thing she ask me is \"Are you ordering the prime rib?  If you are you only have a few minutes.\"  I told her I think I'm gonna get the oxtail soup.  She tells me \"if you are gonna order the soup you have to go outside and wait back in line until 11p.\"  I told her no that's fine, I'll order something else.    She storms off, and proceeds to mumble something to her fellow coworker. While waiting for our waiter...she keeps staring me down like I did something wrong.  Again as she walks by my table she tells the waiter that I have to go back outside if I am ordering the soup.  I'm thinking in my head...wow what did I do to piss her off. I've been nothing but polite to her and the rest of the staff.  Well we finally get our food and guess what...we find a black hair in my son's wonton soup.  At this point I am furious because of all the smart remarks she told us, and the digusting hair in our soup.  Fortunately the waiter did not charge us for the soup and one of the other entrees.    So unfortunately I did not get to try the oxtail soup, and have given 1 star for the rude service.  I did file a complaint with the supervisor who was polite and had me write a statement, as \"Maria\" has been a problem before.    Maybe next time I'll come back to try the oxtail soup when Maria no longer works there.  By the way I have a weird feeling Maria put the black hair in our food but have no way of knowing.  I took a picture of maria as she is giving us the evil death stare....lol.",

But he was hungry and didn't want to send it back for another, so he ate it anyway. It was tough and not tender at all. He said if he ever came back, he would certainly not order this dish again.  I, on the other hand, enjoyed a wonderful butterfish dinner. Hadn't had this in so many years and although it was prepared differently than what I am accustomed to, still the fish was tender, moist, and tasty. I ate every bit of it and wanted more.  Oh, and he ordered a side dish of macaroni salad which came in a tiny container and the salad was bland and untasty. Not going to order THIS again too.

After I cleared some space at the top of the bowl by slurping some of the broth and removing the bones (8), I ordered another order of rice and put it all in the soup.

For those not in the know, the California Hotel or 'the Cal' is a hot zone for people from Hawaii when they visit Hawaii. It's the laws of Hawaiian physics. We all flock here for some reason. Either the cheap food, the  low rolling gambling or just being around other people from Hawaii has everyone coming back for more.   Ahh yes, back to those fond memories. After a night of drinking, gambling and good ole Vegas debauchery in downtown, stumbling into Market Street Cafe at 1am and saying those two magical words, 'oxtail soup,' is a blessing. The order comes with a side of rice as well. The soup is delightful and the meat (if you can get it off the bones) is tender. Adding ginger and cilantro to the soup give it even more flavor!  Besides the oxtail soup, there are many local favorites on their very extensive menu. One of the better deals for dinner is their prime rib + unlimited salad bar + dessert for only $9.99. It's quite a steal and the prime rib is decent. There are daily specials that are written on the board out by the cashier.   Depending on the day and time of year, the line for this joint can be pretty long but hang in there. It moves pretty quickly and we're always seated in no time.",

Filipinos, Hawaiians and everything in between like coming and again, I don't get it. The \"special\" oxtail soup doesn't start until 11:00pm so if you're in line any earlier (as we are right now and we got in line at 10:06pm) they will not seat you. The restaurant on a Labor Day weekend (Sunday) is not that busy but you got all these crazy ass Asians waiting almost an hour for this disgusting soup.   Do yourself a favor and go to the Main Street buffet, much more my style as its close to the same price and you get as much food as you freaking want!!! Or just do it for your innards, this greasy ass shit ain't good for you.",

Sometimes the wait is long, but it is always worth it to sit down to a plate of warm food (especially their oxtail soup which I personally believe has healing properties). Service is friendly and prices are reasonable!  If you're not feeling oxtail soup, there are a lot of options on the menu, like Saimen, steak, and other diner- like options. Worth checking out!",

I got the buffet, and was on my second plate when the family next to me  (they were seated at least 10 minutes prior to me) hadn't even ordered yet. the selection was quite fine: eggs, white rice, sodium-filled meats, hash browns and other fried foodstuffs. as noted, the service was definitely slow, so if you're planning on ordering a la carte, be prepared to wait longer than you did in line. me? got my fill of an island breakfast, and hobbled out happy.",

Waits can definitely be long here, but you can find all kinds of comfort food here. They even have an assortment of Filipino entrees you can have here.   I went with the regular steak and eggs, which comes with toast of choice and either hash browns or white rice. Steak is cooked ok here, I ordered medium rare, it was more medium than anything, but good enough for me. I also had their soup of the day, which was some chicken corn cream soup, tasted exactly like it sounded, nothing special.   Their menu as a whole is pretty large, a lot of breakfast stuff, chef's specials, daily specials, and all the prices are reasonable. Definitely a great choice if you are hungover and want options for food.",

Located inside the California Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas at the Market Street Cafe.   Come here between 11pm - 9am for their graveyard specials. NY steak for like $7. Oxtail soup for $10.99. I had heard so much about their oxtail soup so I had to try it. Around 1030pm people are already lining up for the oxtail soup. The soup was lukewarm so definitely ruined the whole experience. I like my soups boiling hot. Aside from that they are very generous with the portions of oxtail. The oxtail is huge and very tender. The broth was clear and flavorful. It comes with a side of rice. Definitely should substitute it with ramen instead !   My bf ordered the Oriental Soup combo. Comes with noodles, wontons, fish cakes and vegetables. The broth was savory.   Overall the food is okay. The prices are very reasonable. Their service is okay. Cant expect much because they are always so busy. If im in the area I might give it another try but I wouldn't make the drive out here if I was staying on the strip.   Parking is $3 I believe. Remember to get your parking ticket validated if you eat here. So you can save yourself $3 and spend it on a margarita at the sports bar inside the hotel !!",

We waited about 40 minutes to get a table for two for breakfast and then at least another 20 for a very rude waitress to come and take our drink order. She took forever to bring out our drinks and then didn't even ask us if we were ready to order, just disappeared again. She finally came back and took our order and then instead of taking it back to the kitchen she started hanging out with the people at the table next to ours, you could tell that she knew them from outside of the restaurant. We got our food about a half hour later, it was good but not worth waiting that long for, especially when the restaurant was busy but not that busy. Our waitress never came back to check on us and we finally had to flag her down for the check. I asked her for a box but she never came back with it so I finally just gave up and left. They also didn't have a very big variety of choices on the salad bar. The only really great thing about this place was the prices but I'd rather pay more and get good service so I doubt I'll be coming back.",

When we get off of the plane, we eat here right away since our rooms are upstairs in the California Hotel and Casino.  We meet here in the morning every day of our vacation and make our daily plans, talk about our wins from the night before, and discuss family happenings (such as new babies, upcoming weddings, and the old days when my grandparents were alive).  Because this restaurant is open 24/7, sometimes there are long lines while it's empty at other times. It's all timing. ..  We get free meals here, three times a day with coupons that come with the Vacations Hawaii package.   Some favorites: Oxtail soup plus $3 Breakfast buffet with oatmeal (ask for the oatmeal) Prime rib dinner with salad bar Miso butterfish plus $2 The Daily Specials like the Braised Short ribs and Kalua pig and Cabbage  Besides the great service, we enjoy seeing people from Hawaii. The other customers are usually people from home!  It's such a fun and lively place. ..If you want a funny story,  ask me about the baked potatoes. .. hahaha!",

    "text": "This review is only for their late night dining. I've never really frequented this place unless it was after 11pm.  Food: The food they offer here is a mix of American and Hawaiian food, with emphasis on Hawaiian food. There's a few filipino dishes I recognize, but for the most part it's considered a special. Of course, I have to mention the Oxtail Soup, a special that only runs from 11pm-9am in the morning. So if you're a late night owl, this is definitely the dish for you! It's their most popular dish. Although in my opinion, it's a little on the pricey side, it's still a good comfort dish. I've tried the Corned Beef Hash, Steak and Eggs, and Philippine Breakfast (Tocino and Eggs with Rice, my personal favorite). They're all pretty solid diner foods which you can't go wrong with, especially if you like breakfast food (again, my favorite meal).   Environment/Ambiance: It's located in the California Hotel and Casino. Older looking diner, it doesn't really scream Hawaiian theme. Kinda dark and dreary especially at night, but always busy and full of patrons.   Service: Service is pretty quick...once you're seated. Sometimes it takes forever to be seated but that's just an indication of how popular this place is. For the most part, our servers have been pretty welcoming, polite, and friendly. We've had maybe one bad apple that we've had the pleasure of being waited on by.   Tips: Try the Oxtail soup! And if you get the Philippine Breakfast, pour the fried garlic on EVERYTHING! You're welcome.",

I never even tried ox tail before in my entire life, but their soup is sooo good!!  The thing is they are only selling these items during their graveyard special, which is form 11 PM to 9 AM. Right before 11 PM hits, there will be a long line of people waiting to be seated for the specials. The hostess usually is not the nicest, but our interaction is only about 10% of the time we are there.  I'm pretty sure they up the price since six years ago, but the quality and the quantity of the ox tail soup is the same. The broth is so rich and it's perfectly paired with mushroom, celery and carrots. I can't really finish the whole portion, so you can definitely share - just get an extra rice. Ask for hot paste too and dump it in the soup, with the ginger juice.   Definitely one of the things I have to do when I'm in Vegas.",

Lots of visiting Hawaiians frequent this casino and cafe so you know their oxtail is legit. It's a long ride from the strip so if you cab it, your cost per soup jumps exponentially bit if you have a rental car, parking is abundant.",

They look like the locals in hawaii that moved up to the mainland for a change, so their easy to talk stories to.  Loco Moco or Pork Chop is the best.  I've been to many island restaurants in Vegas, no one beats this one.",

Market Street's oxtail soup is the answer for \"Why does oxtail soup taste so good when it's 4am and I am still 2x hungover from the night before from going to (insert your favorite Vegas club / bar / mens club here)?\"  Well let me try to explain...  Their oxtail soup just magically blends and soothes with whatever types of 1. Intoxicants (Rum/Coke, 3 wise men, Redbull Vodka), 2. Edibles (Vegas Buffets - shrimp, prime rib, their little miniature desserts / etc),  and 3. Events Of The Night (my cousin John trying to holler \"Girl with the black dress and leopoard pumps\" ..\"my cousin's Lisa's UNLV graduation\", and just makes it go down soo much easier.  I guess you can call their Oxtail soup the Nyquil of food.  Their banana fritters ain't bad either.",

    "text": "Market Street is a place I've grown to like.  That's because I've been coming here for so long, that I've pretty much settled on a handful of dishes I order whenever I'm here. Although there are a couple of things I'd still like to try.  Plus, not that I'm a late night eater, but it is open all night, and their prices are good.   That said, my favorite soup here is not the Ox-Tail Soup everybody raves about, and honestly, I've never tried, but would like to one day.  No, my favorite soup is the Oriental noodle Soup, which is saimen noodles, fish cake and won-ton dumplings.  I probably get this entree three-fourths of the times I'm here.  The noodles are good, the broth is good, the fish cake and dumplings - it's all good, filling, and for a soup, doesn't bloat you up.  This entree is a four and it's my favorite on the menu.   Other entrees I like here are curry, it's a thick sauce, which is what I like about it.  The spaghetti and chili is also pretty good.  I've never had the burgers, here, though and I'm interested to try. As for the other sandwiches, they are okay.  And the banana split for dessert fills the need if I know I won't be visiting Lappert's upstairs later on.    I hardly ever order anything that includes rice and or vegetables as the sides beacuse I find myself only eating the main item, but not the sides. The main entrees are okay, but it's the sides that are disappointing.  The two main sides are rice and vegetables.  For a restaurant that has a lot of Hawaiian customers, the rice here can be really disappointing, and the vegetables are also disappointing, too.  They have a breakfast buffet that is a pretty good deal - the selections are pretty limited, but the food is okay and less than six dollars, you can't beat the price.",

It's inside the California Hotel in old Las Vegas, but definitely worth the cab ride there.  I paid a $26 dollar cab fare to get there from the Hard Rock Hotel last summer when our total meal only cost us $14 bucks, lol!  They have a variety of late night eats available, the majority of our table of seven had tocino (sweet pork, a Filipino delight!), eggs and garlic rice.  The seventh friend got spam & eggs, it looked scrumptious!  There is a line to get seated at 2:00 a.m.  You might find yourself standing in the amusement park-line set up for a good 20 to 30 minutes, but like Reggie mentioned in his review, it's the perfect time to people watch and giggle about the drunkos nearby.  I think going to Market Street Cafe will be part of our routine whenever we go to Vegas.  It's good and they're open 24 hours, plus I need to try this oxtail soup everyone is talkin' about!",

I was told a lot of the locals eat here, so I already felt kinda special.   I ordered the oxtail soup, which happened to be a hit at that hour. They have a lot of good specials, which I had trouble deciding on. I went with the oxtail soup cause I hardly see it on menus.  The consistency of the soup was good and it was flavorful as well and they weren't shady with the oxtail. Also, the waiters were really nice and quick on their feet.  After that really late night dinner, I decided to play some slots, I was feeling good. So, I put in a 20 dollar bill into some random slot machine and on my last credit, I won 600 bucks!!! I cashed out immediately and decided to take my luck on a different machine and decided to only put five in and again, on my last credit I won $100 and I cashed out immediately.  I came out fully satisfied with the service and my food and hey, an extra 700 to spend on the rest of your vacay in Vegas doesn't hurt at all!",

We were served our drinks real quick but the waiter was extremely slow, we had to wait a good 20mins before he took our order and another 20mins for us to get our food. I ordered their half pound new york steak well done with mashed potatoes(graveyard special)  -mashed potatoes were good but the gravy got to me. It seems as though they put the gravy too early because I noticed that it was a little cold and had already developed a thin gooey layer. -veggies were ok, not much of a veggie lover -the steak was a bit on the dry side but was much better after adding a little steak sauce. overall is wasn't bad,but not great either.  My suggestion is to come here for their Oxtail Soup and their cal prime rib special. I had the prime rib special before and it was a lot better than my new york steak.  Plus you get free ice cream! I think the hours for their cal prime rib is 5pm-11pm but I'm not completely sure about that.",

She came over and advised that the steak was taken care of...she threw it away and expected us to pay for the new steak.   I had to utter the words \"health inspector\" and she immediately snatched the receipt from my hand and stomped off. This was not a good behavior I expected from the manager...especially since I found HAIR IN THE FOOD...TWICE.

The soup has that rich flavor letting you know that its been simmering for hours and hours. The broth is rich, without as much grease or fat as you'd expect. Its well seasoned, and the herbs in it just add those nice little accents as you slurp it down. The meat on the bone is delicious. My fiance cleaned all of her bones bare.   The rest of the food isn't quite as special, but isn't bad. The price is reasonable, the service is okay, its open late, and you have more of a chance of winning at the casino outside than on the strip so that's a bonus.  But seriously...oxtail soup. Bam!",

On Tuesday, the boys hit up the golf course while the ladies hit up downtown Vegas for good food and fun slots!  Breakfast buffet is under $10 a person and offers a variety of stuff to choose from: Ham, sausage, eggs, rice, bacon, biscuits, gravy, hash browns, fruits, corned beef hash, oj and coffee...oh my! One plate and you're stuffed (unless you're like me and must have two plates!). There is usually a wait in the morning but it goes by pretty fast. The food is good for being under $10. It's not to die for and not the best or gourmet type but it's good.   I typically waddle out of here and waddle my way to the bar for a bloody mary...then I waddle my way to a slot machine and stay put for about an hour. That's when you know you're in food coma!  I'm happy with this place and I shall return later this year! See you in October!",

If you look around at the other tables when this is available you will notice that over 90% of the patrons are enjoying the soup. There is a reason for this! It is amazing!  As a side note: the salad bar is also a good value during the day.",

Once seated you'll see a lot of other options like chicken fingers and steak and eggs BUT REMEMBER, you are coming here because you WANT oxtail soup.  Then again this is not to demeanor the other food on menu.  It's this particular dish that stands out but also MAKE SURE YOU SHOW UP AT GRAVEYARD HOURS IN ORDER FOR OXTAIL SOUP TO BECOME AVAILABLE.  If you don't know what that means and you've been going to Vegas, please ask a friend.  Other than that, happy hunting for some real awesome food in Vegas.",

One note, the portuguese sausage on the buffet is not the same as the one that comes ala carte.  If you're not super hungry order the regular breakfast, the sausage is much better.  The daytime server to get is Harvey!",

WHERE: Downtown Las Vegas inside the California Hotel.  WHY: Personally... OXTAIL SOUP!  WHAT: One random night while my family was in town. We were stuck in a situation, and the situation being... WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO EAT!!   A light bulb must have lit up in one of my cousin's heads when she mentioned we get the infamous OXTAIL SOUP FOR ONLY $9.99! It was a unanimous decision, so this is where we went.  They have one of the best graveyard deals ever! You cannot get oxtail soup for 9.99 anywhere! The catch is, it starts at 11pm to 4am I believe? I came here on a whim another time during the day and was bummed because they didn't offer it. It is specifically on the GRAVEYARD menu. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get anything else because our tummies were QUITE SATISFIED. The soup comes with a bowl of rice, which is the filling part. SO GOOD!  I will go there soon and try the other tasty meals they have! The menu looks bomb! HAWAIIAN FOOD FOR THE WIN! =) But in meantime, if you are looking for a late night grub after the clubs, this has to be it!!  I will leave you with this...  OXTAIL SOUP!",

Even though I have been a frequent visitor to the Hotel, I have never really tried any of the restaurants inside the hotel besides Aloha Specialties.  Thanks to the player's club card, I received an amazing coupon that helped push me to explore what else the California has to offer.  My coupon gave me and my lucky husband a free $30 meal at one of the restaurants inside.  Thanks to Yelp I decided to cash the deal on Market Street Cafe.    My husband and I both ended up ordering the Prime Rib Dinner for $9.99.  I won't lie at first I was a little sad that I couldn't get the Ox Tail Soup barbecue they didn't serve it until later, but when I realized what a great deal the Prime Rib was I quickly got over the feeling.  This dinner not only comes with a healthy serving of prime rib with green beans and a potato (or rice), but you also get an unlimited salad bar and ice cream for dessert.  Granted my stomach really couldn't fit the ice cream at the end, but it is nice to have the option.  I would have give then that last star, but there is always a line and they have a lot of time restrictions on some of the meals.  Also, don't be fooled by a short line because the line moves painfully slow. This is especially True when you are super hungry, so try to plan accordingly",

They also ran out of oxtail soup by the time we were seated (which is what everyone seems to be raging about). We did get there at 4:30am, though. I like that they serve loco moco at 4am - after being at a club for 5 hours it's a pretty exciting feeling to see that on a menu. Also the tocino and fried rice combo served all day made me a little less grumpy about the $18 taxi ride from the strip just to find out that they ran out of oxtail soup. Aside from the garlic rice and tocino (which was bombbb), the food was just ok. Might go back to try the oxtail soup, but it's definitely not first on my list of places to eat in Vegas when I visit again.",

Takes the waitress forever to take our order for a party of 2, however she services the party of 10 first, whom seated after us. Anyways the oxtail soup is only served at night from like 9pm- maybe 6am, and $10 shareable or eat the whole damn bowl yourself. It wasn't too salty and was made to perfection. I cannot complain every time I come. Steak isn't your cheap 6.99 that you hope; I think it was 9.99, so go somewhere else for it. Fries were soggy this time, but crispy when I previously came, so it was inconsistent. Random times you'll catch a line, but I was lucky this time to have no waited around 1am and seated immediately. I can't wait to come back.",

Hands down, best oxtail soup in town (next to my mom's oxtail soup, of course). Rich in flavor with lots of veggies and tender, meaty beef. Sure, it's been a while but can't forget how delicious this stuff was.   I participated in the Color Run over the weekend and went to Market Street Cafe in the California Hotel by the recommendation of a friend. Located on the first floor, this place is easy to find. The restaurant is really big with ample seating.   Those in my group were craving breakfast food. One ordered steak and eggs, the other ordered a breakfast special. It was your typical breakfast, nothing extraordinary. But what was awesome were the prices! They also have daily specials, which I opted to get. I ordered the Island Short Ribs for $7.95. It's a large serving of braised short ribs in their absolutely delicious sauce. Fell right off the bone and not overly sweet. A side of veggies, brown rice and macaroni salad also came with the dish. I'm picky about my macaroni salad, but Market Street Cafe does an amazing job to get the macaroni salad just right.   I hear that the oxtail soup is still served during late night hours. I hope I remember to go during a night out in the near future.",

    "text": "Sweet. Baby. Jesus.  A friend of mine from LA (not even a local here) told me about this oxtail soup. Being a fan of all things soup, I HAD to try it. Luckily this friend was also in town, so I was able to enjoy it with her.  As soon as you get to this place inside the California Hotel, you will have to wait in line. I'm convinced everyone is waiting specifically for the soup. Afterall, this soup has magical healing powers. Ok....maybe not. Well...maybe?  Once you get seated (after 10 mins or so), you order. Don't bother with the menu. Although it looks decent. Go for the soup.  The soup is only served after midnight and is $8.95. Your choice of White or Brown Rice.   Couple quick notes:  1. Service is good. Waitstaff is attentive and refills your water/diet coke regularly. 2. The food is solid. THe soup had a VERY flavorful broth, with a good amount of oxtail. I \"murdered\" my soup. Nothing was left but empty bones. 3. Soup could've been piping hot. It wasn't cold by all means, but it wasn't ridiculously hot like at most other joints. 4. Although I skipped the menu, I later found out that there are other deals here. Worth checking out. But only after you try the oxtail soup.  So hop to it. Thank me later. But when you do, send me a bowl of oxtail soup. Because this place? It's LEGIT!",

How have I gone to Vegas all these years and never knew about the famous late night ox tail soup from Market Street Cafe inside California Hotel. Btw California Hotel is actually nothing \"Ca\" related, but more so Hawaiian. Love the irony!   Oxtail soup is ONLY available as part of the \"graveyard\" menu, which is basically 11pm - 8am. There are other items on the graveyard menu, but oxtail soup is where the party is at. It comes with a scoop of rice, cilantro and minced ginger. It also comes in this HUGE bowl, with at least 4-5 huge pieces of oxtail. The broth is full of umami, not too salty, and definitely fresh. It's definitely slow cooked and all the fat has been skimmed off. The oxtail is tender and doesn't require much work to fall off the bone. Be a pro, get a side of noodles to put into your broth and make it an oxtail noodle soup.   Oh yea, the oxtail soup $10.99. WHAT A DEAL!! Definitely returning next time I'm in Vegas!",

If you come after 11pm, it's about 40 minutes to an hour wait. Is the wait worth it? Apparently it is if I went there twice on our last visit. I definitely got my oxtail soup fix. It seems like this soup gains popularity at each visit. I remember when only a handful of patrons would order it. Now, nearly every table has one or two oxtail soups. It is delicious; but, there seemed to be way more fat and bones than meat at our last visit (both bowls at our table). I really hope it was a fluke!",

    "text": "The first time I ate here was a few years ago and I ordered their saimin. I remember it being really good and hitting the spot. But when I ate there last week and ordered the saimin... the broth was SUPER salty. Usually the soup is the best part but I couldn't drink it. So I decided to eat just the noodles, which was ok but still could taste the super salty broth. It tasted like they forgot to add water to the concentrated base or something.  Then we ate there for dinner two days later. We had family staying at the cal and they had coupons so we were just trying to use them up. This time I ordered the adobo (special that day). And that was on the saltier side as well. So maybe that's just the way they cook, heavy on the salt. The service is ok. Nothing outstanding. Food is ok. People probably only come here for the oxtail soup and to use their coupons. But I wouldn't come here if I didn't have family staying here/coupons to use. Sorry guys :(",

I had the loco moco, which I've never had before, but was every bit as good as I imagined it would be. The overeasy eggs were soft and perfectly runny, a crowning golden glory over the chargrilled hamburger patty and rice, adorned in brown gravy. It's not an elegant breakfast, but it is perfect for meal for the morning after a late night of gambling. I had no complaints.",

    "text": "Oxtail Soup , Oxtail Soup, did I say Oxtail Soup. When we stay at the downtown area of Las Vegas we stay at the California Hotel. I like this hotel because it caters to Hawaiian clientele. Las Vegas is known as the ninth island and I think the California Hotel is a large part of that persona. This restaurant is open 24 hours a day. The breakfast menu here is quite extensive. It includes ( Philippine Favorite - three farm fresh eggs and crispy tocino pork, ) , ( Island Style - two farm fresh eggs , portuguese sausage, vienna sausage or spam) and ( Loco Moco - two farm fresh eggs , beef patty and brown gravy ) . We usually get the Luau Breakfast Buffet. There is a nice selection of items and the cost is very very reasonable. The last time we went the cost for three people was less than 25.00. ( prices of 4-3-2019 ). In the past we have ordered  ( Chili Spaghetti - Zippy's award winning chili with rice or spaghetti  ) ,  ( Saimin - dashi broth , fresh spinach, kamaboko , char sui , green onions ) and the Korean Short Ribs - ginger soy , mac salad ). All of these items were priced reasonably and VERY GOOD in taste. The menu here has quite of few choices , it's a Cafe with American (traditional items) with a Hawaiian influence. Finally, I have to mention the Oxtail Soup - braised oxtail , garden vegetables which includes carrots and celery , straw mushrooms, ginger , cilantro , and a savory broth. If around the area when this dish is available give it a try , you'll probably like it. When we have it , it's usually at breakfast time. The availability of the oxtail soup is 1100p.m.- 800am according the restaurant sign. When I called the front desk they told me until 900a.m. Anyways , I'd get there before <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F800a.m.to&s=0b7c1fcc4638522e8b9ccab0b3d2a60fdf19236308ab90073a09c991e6739891\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">800a.m.to</a> be safe. The service here has always been friendly and helpful. This place does get very busy. Overall , decent food at a reasonable price.",

It is an old timer favorite, however they have restricted special price now to a really short dining time.  It ruins the idea of a \"great deal\" of old days.  They still have it for under $13.00, but special was great for under $10.00.  Not a really big deal, but they do need to up the ambiance a bit.  Our server was not one we had ever seen before and wasn't as good as older in the know servers.   We tried the cheeseburger and asked for a slice of pineapple to complete the Hawaii appeal.  She didn't get it...even after reminding her we had asked the manager about doing that and he was down with it!!!oh well not a bad burger at all! I recommend this little spot to anyone",

    "text": "First a disclaimer. I am not giving this place 5 stars because the food is off the hook amazing. It is also not white tablecloth service and frankly it is just a casino coffee shop in a casino not known for glitz or glam. In fact, it is removed from The Strip and here you will definitely not see groomed hipsters inside, celebrity chef restaurant openings, or Maserati's stacked up at the curb.   What you will find is that Sam Boyd's California Hotel and casino has made a name for itself over the years catering to the people from the Hawaiian Islands whether they come over as tourists to spend money or those that have moved here and are now locals for jobs. This is a niche market that they cater to but they have done it very well. For that, it rings the bell and wins the prize.   The one thing that HI locals thrive on is food. Not fine dining cuisine but more like local comfort grindz. At the MSC, they are right at home and it shows. Walk in at any time and you will see many Hawaiians chowing down on stuff that seems out of place in the NV dessert. Ox Tail Soup with ginger and green onion, Saimin, Portuguese Sausage and Eggs, Miso Butter fish, etc. Most definitely Hawaiian style local grindz served here at very reasonable prices. On my latest visit, I'm staying on The Strip but drove over for the $6.25 Luau Breakfast Buffet (think all you can eat scrambled eggs, steam rice, portuguese sausage, bacon and corned beef hash along with some other less important things like breads, cereals, and fruit!) That is the deal of the day and they validate my parking ticket just for eating there! No can go wrong!  In a city that has become known for high-end dining with high-end prices to match, the Market Street Cafe is a great comforting Island style find in the middle of Las Vegas and a great deal all the way around.",

I know the hype about this place had my expectations pretty high, and all I can say is the service wasn't that great and the food was just meh.  I was all excited for the ox tail, and I mis-read the menu and they only have it in the late night.  So I was bummed, yet saw they had short ribs, which are in my top 3 favorite things to eat.  Suffice it to say, MEH. The meat was very tender, the portion of the meat, rice, and mac salad were on point, but holy crap was the sauce salty.  I'm not sure if they do that on purpose for you to eat it with the bland mac salad or what, but I was like why is the line so long for this???  The hostess gave us a huff when we sat down and we asked for a high chair.  She said so you're actually a party of 7 and not 6? I told her we would make it work and made sure there was enough room for the staff to walk next to our table and the wall.  They were busy, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt for the long wait for our food to come and not checking on us for refills on drinks.  Fremont street is very old school, and this place fits the old school cafe feel. I won't exactly rush to come back here, and I'll follow everybody's suggestion that if I do try to come for the ox tail, to come early.",

Luckily for me, Nadine C knew where to go for some oxtail soup in Downtown Vegas. Not only is she an expert tour guide in LA but also in Vegas!   We arrived at Market Street Cafe in the morning and there was a line! We purposely came early but the line was already around the corner. They gave us an option to sit with others since a larger table was available but no one wanted to do that. We waited a bit more then Nadine saw some counter seats open so she snagged them. No more wait! Yay! Time for food!   Apparently they have a system here of who prepares drinks and who you can order from. So I had to order coffee and food from two different people. Odd. Customer service wasn't great overall. We had to wait a bit to order. Finally the server who can take orders came and we ordered their oxtail soup.   The coffee was horrible but the oxtail soup hit the spot! They gave decent portions of oxtail and it was cheap compared to Hawaii. All of the oxtail meat  fell of the bone except one piece which was nice. The soup base was good and they gave just enough rice (1 scoop) for the meal. Good spot to check out when craving oxtail soup.",

    "text": "Thanks to friends who flood my Facebook wall feeds with local Vegas eats!  After a long night of partying hard during our first night in Vegas, it was time for a night cap meal. 3am and my cousin and I had anti-hangover food in mind. That's were I remembered the oxtail soup at the Market Street Cafe inside the California Hotel.  When we arrived around 4am, we were about the fourth ones in line. But, the dining area was packed. Our wait didn't take that long since we were only a party of two. Once we were seated, I searched for the oxtail soup entree. I read the fine print on the menu regarding the oxtail soup special. The menu states that the soup is currently served from 11pm to 9am with a $9.99 price tag. With it being 4am, I was elated to try it out!  Our waiting time for our food was around twenty minutes. It was understandable since the cafe was always packed. When our food arrived, it looked like I had one big piece of oxtail. But that wasn't the case. Under the thick cuts of celery and leaves of cilantro, more pieces were under there. There were also meat pieces embedded at the bottom of the huge bowl! The meat was that tender! This dish was also accompanied with a small plate of white rice. This place knows carb control. As for myself, I would have filled up my bowl with rice until there was no broth left. The broth of the soup had me in shock! It actually tasted like how my Dad makes his oxtail soup, but with different vegetables. Full of flavor and the right kind of saltiness.  Market Street Cafe had my home cooked meal waiting for me. But having my Dad pop out the kitchen, that would have been just too weird!",

Anytime I'm in Vegas, this is the to go place after 11:00 PM, they have Oxtail soup there, which is a hit. For $11.99 you get chunks of Oxtail meat some carrots and celery in there. This soup is one soup, I always get when in Vegas. It's only served after 11:00 PM.   I've ordered other menu items like Egg's Benedict and some Hawaiian dishes. The food is great for being under $10.00 for most of their items.  But the Oxtail soup is the main reason I go there. Only, if they had a lime wedges for the soup, but you can ask for lemon, not quite the same, but does the trick with the cilantro, onions, ginger and side of rice.   This is a must when in Vegas.

It's fairly close to the bar scenes past the covered Fremont street and it's quite easy to navigate to within the casino.   Just enter within the line/queue and you'll be seated immediately when a table is open! Pretty good menu, and they definitely cater to us Filipinos and Hawaiians. Portuguese sausage? Corned beef? Tocino? They've got it :) (I got the two large eggs, corned beef hash, hash browns And toast, but you can always get rice instead of hash browns if you're like my friends next to me!)   Prices are fairly good for the portions you get and its definitely a good place for some late night or early mornings breakfast. I've even been here for dinner and they've catered to what I was craving for. Also check out their specials (Ox tail soup after a certain time) and their salad Buffet :) Nothing too spectacular, but very nice and courteous servers, and good food. Definitely will be back whenever I'm in the area.",

The only thing is, they actually don't offer it until after 11:00 pm. Everyone in my party was disappointed because we went to downtown for that particular reason.   The place was kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the California Hotel. Because of all the renovations, the entrance is actually blocked by a large tarp. The wait for our large group took a long time, and when we were finally seated we saw at least half of the place empty.   The staff on the other hand was very helpful and tried to accommodate everyone.   I ordered the Philippine breakfast which did not disappoint. It came with tocino, rice and eggs.   I also ordered a side of macaroni salad which tasted really bland. I was excited because it is after all a Hawaiian themed hotel so I figured they would at least have good macaroni salad.   I will probably come back for the ox tail soup because everyone can't stop talking about it.",

Supposedly if you have some kind of coupon book it's pretty much almost free for a lot of things(all the Hawaiian tourists):  Came here with 2 other couples and here's what we ordered:  - (2) oxtail soup: I only tried a spoonful but the broth was flavorful, generous portion of the oxtail itself. Tender, fall off the bone goodness was the consensus. Was it worth it? Yea for $10.99-not bad  - chili and rice: this was good, I thought it had too much beans but that's just a personal preference. I don't know what Zippy's is but supposedly that's who makes it(?)  - New York steak: comes with a side of green beans(probably from a can) and mash potatoes with gravy. Cooked medium rare. I didn't try it but bolt other said it was Meh.   - Won Ton Min: Saimin with pork dumplings-I didn't try it but the friend said the won tons tasted like a ball of \"dough\" nothing special   - Island short ribs: braised ribs in their homemade house sauce. Omg this was soooooo good! Super tender and flavorful. Served with rice and canned green beans. The mister devoured it.  Give it a go!",

I had their teri burger and while it was big they used the sweet teriyaki sauce, not the authentic teri sauce most locals know. Burger didn't taste all that bad but it doesn't come with french fries?! How do you not offer burgers with french fries? Who does that? And sub in macaroni salad instead. Blah! Portions are huge! My grandma ordered a hamburger steak plate that could feed 2-3 people. My aunty got their saimin, wow. I'd be there for days eating that thing and their side teri chicken comes with two pieces. So that's pretty much the only thing going for them. The Filipino guy behind the register not very friendly, and the young Filipino girl was nicer. This happens to be a local favorite but I think it's only because of its convenience.",

Don't even order anything else. I'll let you know right now that the blueberry pie is awful. Just stick with the soup.  For $9.99 you get a humongous bowl of three large oxtails, all bathing in a tasty broth with a medley of vegetables. The oxtails are meaty and fatty. Forget being prim and proper while eating. Leave your table manners behind and start grubbin'.   Service isn't the greatest. You have to flag servers down if you need anything, because they disappear once your order has been delivered.   The soup is what really keeps people coming back to Market Street Cafe, but if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't return. 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "There is only one thing to drool over this restaurant. THE OXTAIL SOUP.  Let me give you a little bit of a background as to why this soup is phenomenal to Filipinos. In Manila, after a good night out with friends, people do love to eat and what better way to cap the night (or day) is to have good bowl of soup. Bulalo Soup in particular. And preferrably in Tagaytay (a 2-hour drive from the metro). Bulalo Soup is very similar to the Oxtail Soup. But instead of the oxtail, they use beef bone marrow. And this is very nostalgic to Filipinos. So the semblance of the oxtail soup somewhat sends the palate close to home and tugs the heart.   When dining into this restaurant be mindful of the time you are visiting. Apparently, the soup is not on the menu 24/7. It may either be in a Friday special or served pass 11:00 PM only. Me and my friends came in at 10pm. They are not allowed to serve it just yet so we had to wait a while longer. We ordered other dishes in the menu and were definitely a surprise because it is actually good. I tried the fried Saimin and the Lau lau and it was very tasty. We ordered the oxtail soup at exactly 11PM. I was curious as to why they only serve it that time so I asked. Our server said it takes a while for them to boil the oxtail because they slow cook it until tender.   We're done by 11:30PM and going out, about 20-30 people started to line up so I guess 10:30 is a good time to drop by to experience that hearty soup served with cilantro and crushed ginger with a side of plain white rice. The soup is good for sharing and extra soup is just $2 additional.",

This is the perfect spot after some late night clubbing.    * LOCATION * Inside the California Hotel  * OX TAIL SOUP *  Please note that they only have the $9.99 Ox Tail Soup between 11pm to 9am.  For $9.99, you get a ginormous bowl of OX TAIL SOUP.  I estimated that there were 6-8 pieces of giant ox tails in my bowl and I can barely finish it.  The soup is good, but I felt that it was a little on the salty side.  * SERVICE & WAIT *  Meh.  Server came and go.  Never really paying attention to our party.  It was a challenge getting our water refilled or getting our check.  I arrived the restaurant shortly after midnight and there was a long line to get in.  I guess this special is no longer a secret and everyone is trying to get some delicious soup after a long day of drinking and partying.",

    "text": "I am a fan of the casino cafe (or Diner as they call them in New York). Sadly, the casinos are gradually replacing them with newer restaurants. In downtown Las Vegas, we recently lost the El Cortez Cafe to Pizza Lotto and the Golden Nugget Cafe to Claim Jumper. I believe that the old school casino cafes compliment the casino experience along with good food at reasonable prices. And so, when I met up with my brother on the Fremont Street East District, we'd walk to the Cali where I'd take advantage of some good old school cafe food.       The Market Street Cafe is both the Cali cafe and a restaurant serving Hawaiian food. Their oxtail soup has become a Las Vegas legend. This is no accident. The Cali caters to the Hawaii market and is the epicenter of the Ninth Island casino scene. Market Street Cafe also features a diverse menu with a range of reasonably priced comfort food and daily specials. I usually order the $9.99 prime rib special. This includes the soup and salad bar; a choice of baked potato with sour cream and butter, rice, or mashed potatoes; with cherry jubilee a vanilla ice cream based dessert.       Market Street Cafe is a popular dining spot along the Fremont Street Corridor. Just like the last few times I dined here (including before I became Daniel. S Yelper),  a long line is the admission to this dining experience. The long line is the prelude to a restaurant that fills to capacity. The line usually moves along.       Immediately after ordering, I headed to the soup and salad bar, which is usually included with the dinners. The only flaw with the soup and salad bar is that the soup was nonexistent. I was satisfied with the salad. The salad bar also featured corn salad and pasta salad.       The impersonal waitress soon delivered the prime rib dinner. It was a nice cut of beef with the exception of a couple of fat spots. Overall it was flavorful. With the prime rib, a jus sauce added an additional layer of taste. Complimenting the prime rib was a baked potato that I flavored with butter and sour cream. This was nothing like the baked potato that I recently dug into in the Triple 7 Restaurant in Cali's sister property Main Street Station. It also included green beans that they can keep for the pigs in the North Las Vegas pig farm. It was halfway into festing on the prime rib that the waitress added an additional item onto the table. It was my dessert. Placing dessert on a guest's table when they are half way into the meal is an ABSOLUTE NO NO. Talk about hurrying somebody! Talk about unprofessional service. And let me talk more about poor service. The unprofessional waitress failed to ask me if I wanted a Pepsi refill. So following the cordial rule of dining, I tasted the cherry jubilee that is really vanilla ice cream after finishing the prime rib and baked potato. I just made it to the ice cream because it started melting.       After paying around $13 to the cashier and showing the casino cashier my receipt for the parking validation, I walked past the banks of Cali slot machines filled up yet slightly annoyed. As I waited for the light to turn green at Ogden Street, it was clear to me that I will be dining at and yelping at least nine Fremont Street restaurants before and if I do go to Market Street Cafe.   Pictures of the $9.99 Prime rib dinner meal experience:",

If you are coming for Prime Rib it is only from 4pm-10pm not sooner not later and the Ox tail soup is the same just time change from 11pm-some time NO SOONER NO LATER . . .  3. If you come past 10 pm and want salad you will only have a hour because at 11pm they throw ALL the salad out.

The deal doesn't start til 11PM so we tried to sit down first, however, the hosts could not sit us til five minutes til 11 which kinda sucked. When 10:40 approached, the lines grew and even after we finished our meal there was still a line.   My first time I came here the special was only $5.99 but now the price rose to $9.99. This soup is worth it though! If you never had oxtail soup before, I would advise you to try it here! Their broth is full of flavor and the meat is tender and juicy! This dish is totally worth your money!   The only complaint I have is that some of the workers are rude, but not all of them! I only tried one dish here and I would definitely come back here my next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "Cafe closes for deep cleaning every other Tuesday from 10:20pm to 6am. During this period they offer to serve a limited menu upstairs in the Ohana conference room. It's great that they keep up with their sanitation standards but unfortunate for us it was occurring during our visit.   So this review is solely based on our dining experience on this occasion.  First, all guests were told they'll begin serving in the Ohana room at 11pm, instead doors didn't open until 11:15pm...bad  The seating in the Ohana room was arranged in banquet style round tables so we had shared a table with 2 other parties.....it was a good 15 minutes before everyone around the table got use to it  When my highly anticipated bowl of Oxtail arrived, it was only 3 pieces of oxtail with lukewarm broth, it was a disappointment.  I asked the waitress what happened to the peanuts, celery and carrots? She said \"peanuts was no longer served in soup due to allergy reasons\". So why the missing vegetables?  We couldn't help but noticed that other later patrons had the veggies in their oxtail soup....BAD  Then half way thru my soup, our waitress came back with a bowl of diced carrots and celery, claiming that the cook forgot the veggies and she offered it around our table.  She was nice about it but it was a very laughable situation.  We also noticed they were carting in many bowls of oxtail soup to a corner microwave to be reheated. Really? Granted there was no kitchen nearby, so this whole setup was a bad dining substitution.   Market street cafe would retain a better reputation by staying completely closed on cleaning Tuesdays rather than attempting to serve the general public in a chaotic unorganized manner.",

After 1130pm you can get a really good version of oxtail for just $9.30.   The broth is seasoned well, there is plenty of ginger and star anise noted, and just in case it's not enough, you get a side of grated ginger with cilantro.  The oxtails are big and meaty, which in some joints, you don't get consistency but they are always big.  The lines can be long depending on the flight's from Hawaii, but, it moves fast, there service is great, almost as good as Flamingo's use to be back in Hawaii!",

On multiple occasions I have run into family and friends here coming for their oxtail soup.  We usually only order two things from the Market Street Cafe... their oxtail soup for and their Zippy's chili spaghetti.    Of all the oxtail soups that I have tried, this one is my favorite.  The meat falls off the bones and the broth is flavorful but not too salty.  The soup comes with some large pieces of oxtail, carrots, celery, and peanuts.  It also comes served with ginger, parsley, and a side of rice.  I like to mix the ginger and parsley with soy sauce to dip my chunks of oxtail in.  The price has been rising slowly over the years.  It is now $9.99.  Still worth it in my opinion.  I order this 99% of the time.  We also like their Zippy's chili spaghetti.  It is the same chili that is served in the Hawaii chain, Zippy's.  The only thing is that they give you tons more here than they do at Zippy's!  What a steal for about $6.  The actual entree is called Chili rice but you can substitute for spaghetti.  Expect a line around midnight and again around 2am... when people leave the clubs.  You will get more and more drunk Asians as the night gets later.",

This side of Vegas is definitely not anywhere near the atmosphere of the strip BUT I'm all about CHEAP & GOOD food. The reasons for knocking off the stars: the service wasn't all that great especially in the beginning I felt like we waited forever but I will say we were a party of 13 so I can't be too mad about that. I wasn't hella hungry & saw the big portions of the soup & everyone else in my party was ordering it so I went with the Korean BBQ sparerib appetizer. The flavor wasn't bad at all but I did wish there was more meat than fat on my plate & the texture was pretty tough. It did seem like they just bought and dumped Korean BBQ sauce on it than actually having marinated meat. The plate also came with macaroni salad that I was craving since they serve Hawaiian food but it was disappointing and flavorless. As for the oxtail soup, the flavor reminded me of Filipino nilaga mixed with a watered down beef stew a little sweet, salty, & savory. It wasn't like OMG this is the best thing ever BUT it wasn't that bad either. My family enjoyed it & appreciated that it comes with a side of rice but did say they all thought it would be even better if it was hotter in temperature & I did notice the meat easily falls right off just how it should if it's cooked for 96 hours! Now that I think about it, my plate as well as my cousins who ordered the Filipino breakfast  was served cold as well. Lastly, my boo ordered the mahi mahi and was not happy about it.. he'd give it 3/10 because the breading was basically only egg and the side seemed like old canned green beans.",

    "text": "We came here looking for an \"amazing\" oxtail soup that was hyped up by a Vegas regular. He neglected to mention it is only served during certain hours. We came right around 10:45a. Waited awhile at the hostess stand. Several staff members passing, no one acknowledged us waiting. Finally the hostess shows up and seats us right next to the buffet (many other seats available). So I asked the lady that brings our coffee about the oxtail because I didn't see it on the menu. Unfortunately, I was too late! But I was also starving so I considered the buffet since we sitting so close but of course, it was about to close and having had a look at it, it looked that way. Everything looked like it had been sitting out for a while. Which is acceptable being that they were about to close it. So I decided against the buffet. Our waitress shows up. We ask for a few more minutes. Then she shows up again about 15 mins later. In the meantime, they are clearing the buffet and couldn't be any louder about it. Metal trays sounded like they were being thrown in the cart. Sitting so close, I couldn't even hear my self think. Let alone have a conversation. Me and my bf both ordered the prime rib scramble and a side of bacon. Waitress walks into the kitchen right after taking the order and comes right back out with the side of bacon. Obviously taken from the leftovers of the buffet line. Fine, that's forgivable. What's not forgivable is the horrible prime rib scramble. Absolutely no flavor! I never use salt after the fact but this desperately needed it. And the meat was definitely leftover. But how old, I couldn't tell you. It was gray in color and rubbery. I wouldn't even feed it to a dog! That being said, we cashed out after a few bites. Should've spent that $26 on video poker!",

I had the fried chicken dinner, which was okay, but what what gives this place it's 5th star on the map is the OXTAIL SOUP.  At 5am after several shots of patron, sometimes we need the quickfix of either something nice and greasy or some hot soup. I have to admit this oxtail soup was one of the best soups  I have ever had.  It was so rich in flavor (probably with MSG), but who gives a crap when your drunk at 5am. All I really care about is to get back to the hotel or drink my recovery drink, and the OXTAIL Soup literally did its job for me.",

We went there on a Tuesday night and the line wasn't as long as I expected it to be. We were seated quickly in the lower area of the restaurant. The only problem I had with being seated there was that the tables and chairs are so close together that I kept worrying that I would need to move my chair in for someone else to pass behind me.  The service was good. There was a mix-up between my order and my mother's. I had ordered a potato with my chicken tenders and she had ordered rice with her meal and they gave me the rice and her the potato. But it was fixed quickly and the rest of the meal went fine. The reason for the higher score was due to the food always being consistent and good, not the service. Our waitress only returned once after serving us our meals, to remove the dishes. I had to flag someone else down to request more water.  But, all it all, it's a good place to go. The prices are reasonable. The menu isn't extensive, but it is good sized. If you're Downtown, it's a nice place to go for a casual meal.",

    "text": "Worst take out experience ever. First I waited in line to order fries to go and the lady told me I had to order it at the counter when she could have told me that 5 min ago when she knew I was doing a take out. So I went to the counter and ordered my fries and stood there for about 10 min. I saw the fries come out and the lady came up to me and said I had to go pay for the fries up front. So I waited in line and told the lady I wanted to pay for my take out of fries. She said I need the receipt. I told her the lady didn't give me a receipt. She told me that I had to go get it. So I sent my boyfriend to go get it. That lady told him that she gave me the receipt when he was with me and we both know that she didn't give me the receipt. So I told the lady at the register that she didn't give me a receipt. She told me \"then leave\". Then the lady who took my order came up with the receipt and the French fries and said \"oh I didn't give you a receipt?\". So I told her no she didn't and she appologized. Then the lady at the register acted like nothing was wrong. When she literally told me to leave when my fries were already done cooking and all they needed to do was pay for it. All of this just happened about 10 minutes ago and I am very disappointed.  45 minutes waisted for just a take out of fries and rude service.  Not to be rude but some people think they can talk to you the way they want just because they are older....",

This place would seriously get 4 stars just based on Oxtail Soup alone, but a rating does consists of other things too if it is a restaurant.   Service was OK = 1 star (I can't say they were extremely nice, but they weren't rude and plus it was also packed when we were there after hours)  Food = 1 star (downside is that out of all the times I've been here, I've only ordered the oxtail soup, rating isn't based on anything else)  Food Prices = 1 star (Decent and not over priced if you come here during graveyard hours, prices are even cheaper)  There's my 3 stars I really wish I can rate it better but it is a restaurant and I should rate it as a restaurant. Maybe sometime I will come back and try something different, but I'm not sure I will try something different as long as they keep oxtail soup on the menu.",

    "text": "I come here for the OXTAIL SOUP or if I have a night out with my friends downtown, this is the place to go to afterwards.  Management at this place is a joke. Some of the workers aren't the nicest people also. I went here last night, and there was a total of 4 of us. We ordered one oxtail soup, a side of fries, and a side of bacon since we weren't super hungry. We asked for an extra plate, and the server told us it was $2 for an extra empty plate. So we just said.. \"Oh ok, never mind then. Thanks.\" So my one friend ended up finishing the oxtail soup. Ok, no big deal. Of course when we get our check, they end up charging us the $2 for the extra plate that we never got. Immediately we brought that up to our server especially if we didn't even end up sharing. I can tell that she didn't wanna deal with it. Right away, she asked us if we wanted to talk to the manager. We addressed the issue to the manager. She said (I kid you not), \"Nope. Sorry, you're gonna have to pay for it. There's 4 of you and 1 entree.\"...... and she walks away. I know that it's only $2, and I wouldn't have minded. It was the way that they approached us that frustrated us.   After coming here quite often, I would say that I am satisfied with the service half the time, and the other half, we end up walking out pissed off....... But we still come back for the oxtail soup!",

I will have to disagree because I found something even better.  The Butterfish.  No, this fish is not extinct, but growing up in Hawaii eating this on special occaisions (or at least i considered eat it a special occaision), I feel like i have found heaven again.  I had it for 3 meals during my 4 day stay.  It is absolutely imperative that you eat it OVER two scoops of rice...yes let the fish and the sauce soak into the rice and then dig in...if you don't know what I am talking about, i don't know what you're doing in the Cal, cause it would mean that you're not from Hawaii!!!  Seriously, i was craving the butterfish here even more than the King Crab Legs at the Wynn Buffet.  Call me crazy, but aren't we all a little bit crazy anyway?  Happy Eating!",

    "text": "Market Street Cafe located inside the California Hotel Casino in old downtown Las Vegas is a mirage to locals and tourist from Hawaii! From the get go you will notice employees with the Hawaiian uniforms and Hawaiian workers and guests! How ironic being the name of the place is California. Nonetheless still a place that caters to all ethnicities.  It is rumored that liaisons contact Hawaiian travel agency and tourist a package deal to get tourist I stay and visit...which is smart marketing!  Asides from loose slots that gets customers playing a while without losing all their money quick...it is the food and specials that are the perfect perks to reel in the big catch!  They have various places in California hotel...but Market Street Cafe is the main attraction.    First and foremost it is the oxtail soup that receives the most attention.  It's familiar taste to Asian cultures have a similar taste to Filipino's bulalo soup and other Hawaiian, Korean and what not.  Also, since their special for oxtail soup starts at 11pm it is great for a late night hang over cure as well! Beware tho at peak hours especially for specials...the line gets long. But if you run into it...need not worry....it goes at a fairly steady pace.  The other special they have before 10pm is the Prime Rib! To have it done at medium is at its best! The tender and juicy cut of meat mixed with salivation of hunger melts this hunk of chunk so smoothly!  Anything higher in cooking is fair game...still tender but the taste comes different and more like corned beef....usually places that cook prime rib at this level be a little tougher but still have that prime rib flavor...so again I recommend medium.  With this price coming in at an amazing $9.99 one must be reminded not to forget it comes with an all you can eat salad bar that includes macaroni salad (a crowd favorite especially Hawaiians) and fruits! Plus you get a warm cherry/cinnamon vanilla ice cream sundae like concoction with a cone like wafer on the side.    You have to remember this place is old, but respectable.  Might not be a place for fine dining but for a casual and deal breaker and wanting it to hit the spot...this is the place!  I haven't had a chance to try their other stuff, but some say they are just as good and satisfying. Happy Eating! And Aloha!",

I wouldn't really recommend the lau lau, but everything else is really tasty and GREAT for the price! The prime rib is a really generous size, but they tend to overcook it a bit so I suggest ordering it a little rarer than you normally would. The salad bar has a great selection, in addition to the lettuce salad, I really like the macaroni salad, the broccoli dish, and the crab salad.  I'm really looking to try the oxtail soup that everyone else has been raving about. I can't wait to come back.",

If you think eating a big bowl of Pho is perfect after a night of heavy drinking, imagine that satisfaction...TIMES A THOUSAND when you're eating a bowl of hot, delicious ox tail soup!  Never again will I go to Vegas w/o getting my soup fix here =)  The broth is deliciously salty and perfect, with generous portions of tender meat that falls off the bone.  (I love it when people aren't sheisty with the meat!)  They serve it with cilantro and tons of minced ginger and served piping hot.  Ask for chili on the side and dump your rice in the soup and mix and *sluuuuuuurp* GET YOUR CHOW ON.  Only $9.95 and served only at night...only catch is the time so don't forget.  Starts at midnight until 6am PERFECT for the after spot.  I love (method man voice) THE CAAAAAL!  Sure, it's packed w/ senior citizens but who better to gamble next to than some veterans??   Pit bosses and dealers here are AWESOME too friendly and chill... They comped us 3 FREE SOUPS when we spent a few hours playing blackjack =)   that was the best $100 bowl of soup I've ever had!  (get hawaiian shaved ice upstairs w/ vanilla ice cream yum for dessert)",

They have a graveyard shift menu that includes Steak with fixings for $4.00, Oxtail Soup (served after 11PM) for $6.50, and other Hawaiian and American dishes. I think this was a nice simple pleasure in my trip to Las Vegas. There are a lot of Hawaiians here, but it just gives you that laid back feeling. The best part was, when we were in line, a bunch of younger people (20s or so) who were in front of us, let like 10 of their friends cut in front of them. Well, my friend walked over and saw a waitress he knew, and we just left the line and walked right in. With the shock and WTF look on those kids faces. Priceless.",

The reason we do it so that we can tip our waitress in cash.  She also wouldn't accept 2 credit cards, therefore if you have a party make sure all you have cash.  The phillipine breakfast was disgusting, I order it with scrambled eggs and I felt like it was a whole stick of butter mixed with those eggs.  The tocino, maybe I'm not filipino but it was so greasy and fattening.  The oxtail soup, maybe we got a bad batch but it was really salty and wasn't flavorful.  O well, lesson learned.  Definitely not worth the drive from the strip to this cafe.  What the hell were my friends thinking? Maybe it was the drunk talk.",

The bento was a good treat with thick cut teriyaki beef, spam, and chicken katsu. The teriyaki sauce was nice and sweet and the chicken katsu hit the spot. The fried noodles was okay, nothing like Leewards Drive Inn or Sato's but it did the job. Overall good food and the service was pleasant and quick.",

It is very hard to eat and it gets stuck to your teeth.  Bring floss. Not tender enough. I definitely had tasted better. I think they have to boil the oxtail a little bit longer.  It can be better.  Instead of rice, do toasted French bread.  That will be much much better.   They will sell out if they cook it a little longer.  It is not easy to cook oxtail.   T-bone steak.  I had a piece that tasted a little rotten.  I only took a few bites because I don't want to get sick.  It was over cooked and taste like card board.  They have to throw away meat that has been sitting there for too long.",

It's still a great deal with the all you can eat salad bar, prime rib, and cherries jubilee for desert. Sometimes the prime rib is hit or miss with the quality, but it's all still edible.   Other hawaiian offerings include butterfish, saimin, wonton soup, and the famous late night Oxtail soup (11pm -11am). Also, give the banana fritters a try for dessert.

Ever since I was introduced to this place many moons ago, I make it a point to come here and have my fill of some of the best soup ever. It's like having your grandmother's homemade cooking right in the heart of downtown Las Vegas.   The service is a little bit rough though. It's like dealing with the soup nazi from Seinfeld. You don't know what you want? Okay...we'll move on and good luck trying to get the server's attention again. Ever. Call me crazy, but I think that's what makes this place enjoyable and is fine by me.  A piece of advice: get well acquainted with the menu while you wait in the ridiculously long line (because their oxtail soups draws a crowd.) Once you get seated and pleasantries are exchanged, you quickly tell the server that you want the soup (because why wouldn't you order the soup...that's why you're here) and whatever it is that you want and that's it. They'll come with the soup and whatever else you ordered pretty as you please and the servers will check on you exactly two more times after that. Once for some refilling and the next for the check.   Come here and come often. This is one of the best places to have oxtail soup. You won't be disappointed.   Till next Yelp!",

    "text": "Oh, this just wasn't good.  Waiting in line to be seated I saw a special for butterfish and thought I would be ordering that.  When we were finally being seated, getting into the booth was an overwhelming fishy smell, the table next to us was eating the butterfish special.   I couldn't even think about what I wanted to order, I knew I wasn't ordering that though,  the smell was so horrendous, the women eating it even commented on how fishy it was. Yuck.  My husband and I decided on the oriental saimin soup.  We got the kalbi rib appetizer and our kids ordered chicken fingers and the mahi mahi sandwich.  The only saving grace of this meal was the saimin,  we ALL ate out of the two bowls.  The kalbi ribs were swimming in teriyaki sauce, without the sauce they might have been pretty good, the meat was nice and tender and easy to eat, however the sauce made it undesirable, they came with a little bowl of mac salad and don't know what kind of mayo they use but it left a weird aftertaste. The chicken fingers were your run of the mill pre-frozen fried strips, nothing special and not horrible but he didn't even finish one strip. The vegetables were ice cold as were the fries,  we just hate cold limpy fries. And the mahi sandwich looked good but my son didn't really care for it and I wasn't about to taste test it.  Salad bar came with one of the meals, we loaded a plate with a little of everything and little of everything was taken away. No good. Oh, and we had the chili with rice, the first bowl of rice was covered in oil! Waitress said it was butter, that's still disgusting. She brought us another bowl, better rice but it wasn't good Asian sticky rice. And the chili wasn't good either.   Seems like we should have ordered oxtail soup by all the reviews but we'll never get to try it now since we won't be back.   We usually eat upstairs but it's been twenty years since we have eaten at the cafe so I wanted to give it another try.  We are so sticking with the upstairs restaurant from now on.",

Luckily by then there were plenty of tables open ( I heard this place gets packed around 2am).   Walking through the casino, I didn't expect much from this place.  The casino itself is old, smelly, rundown and empty.    Food:  I ordered the ox-tail soup with no greens and extra ginger on the side.  It comes with a bowl of rice.  Friend got the Hawaiian breakfast.  As soon as I tasted the ox tail soup I was in heaven.  It was perfectly flavored and the meat was so tender.  They actually give you a huge portion of meat!!  Us ladies just dug right in.  Now I know what all the hype is about.  The soup is deeeeelicious!!!  5-stars!!  I tried a bit of my friends Hawaiian breakfast and it was also really good.  The meat was not overly salted.    Service:  It was average.   The waitress forgot my friends order of hasbrowns but once we brought it to her attention she brought it out right away.   I'm not going to complain too much seeing as they must be tired working those late hours.  Ambiance: it's like an asian Denny's.  Also, I was very disgruntled with some of the people sitting near us.  A table full of immature, gross, uncivilized guys.  Didn't their mothers teach them not to be a D-bag to ladies?  I don't appreciate them secretly snapping pictures of us and staring.  It's rude.    Would I ever go back? HECK YEAH!!  I had ox-tail soup withdrawals after I left.  I've researched places in my area for ox-tail soups but nothing will ever compare to this place.    5 Stars for food 3 Stars for service 0 Stars for immature ass****s",

I think their fries are a little dry so I usually order mashed potatoes with my prime rib. After several tries, their prime rib is at its best medium rare (I usually order my meat medium), so I had to adjust my preference. It's juicy and chewy and I feel like my testosterone levels are kickin' in whenever I'm eating a big piece of meat. In that case, I have to balance it out by eating ayce salad.   I really like their salad bar, especially their broccoli salad and bottomless edamame. Their \"crab\" salad can be a little too salty at times, so that's a hit or miss for me. I'm not a big fan of their coleslaw, I don't even know how to describe it. The rest of the salad selection is pretty average (in a good way).   I've also tried their oxtail soup (once) and thought it was too salty. It's also lacking some veggies. But I won't mind giving it another try. Some of my friends swear it's THE best hangover remedy lol. Its usual diners are Asian families getting their local food grub on and old folks eating after bingo or something. Overall, this place ain't bad at all.",

Wait was not bad at all after 11. 5-10 minutes waiting time but went by quickly! Felt like being back home on Oahu. I will always visit this place when visiting Vegas!",

It's been 4 years and I finally caved and OH MY was it wonderful!! The oxtail soup here is  MONEY. Meat falls right off the bone and the broth is just so darn flavorful. And the vegetables and fresh garlic add a world of freshness. Don't even bother to look at the menu or get anything else. Just the soup. Seriously  There is almost always a line, but just wait! A pot of gold will be on the other side.",

    "text": "I LOVE the Market Street Cafe.  LOVE.  I've lived in Las Vegas for about 5 years and I've gone probably once a month for the past five years.  I have not sampled a large selection from their menu because I stick to a couple of basic things.  1.  Prime Rib Special.  If I'm there after 4, there's no question about what I'll eat.  Tasty prime rib, soup or salad, baked potato, green beans almondine and cherries jubilee for dessert.  All for $7.99.  It used to be $6.99, but the price went up about a year ago.  Still, best prime rib special in town.  In my dozens of times eating the prime rib, I can only remember being disappointed once.  Even then, it was good and I didn't feel ripped off by paying eight bucks for it.  2.  Things made with fish.  If I'm not there in the evening, I stick to things made out of fish.  The fish and chips, butterfish, etc are all pretty good.  I've tasted catfish from friends' plates - also good.   Lunch and dinner specials all come with the salad bar or soup.  The salad bar has declined in quality a little bit, but I think that's how they kept the prices low when food costs started rising.  There used to be sushi and spinach and a few other things, but now those things are gone.  It's pretty basic, but has more than enough to keep you happy - especially since it's not an additional charge with a daily special.  A few people have mentioned the service and I think it's really hit and miss.  Sometimes it's awesome and your glass is refilled before it hits the table.  Other times it can be tough to get someone to come over.  The number of customers fluctuates so drastically that I think they  have a hard time knowing how many servers to keep on the floor.  Either way, I always leave happy.",

The meat is always fall-off-the-bone tender perfection. The soup itself, however, is all over the place. Sometimes it is bland despite handfuls of garlic and cilantro. Sometimes it is so salty you end up eating all the rice with just a splash of soup. Sometimes it is heaven-on-earth perfection. And when it is good, it is very very good. This would definitely be a 4 or 5 star review is they could just stick to the perfect Goldilocks medium every single time.   The service is perfectly fine, a little aloof, but at this hour they do a perfectly pleasant job of dealing with the drunkards trying to pre-empt their hangovers with oxtail soup.   Whenever we go out in downtown, I secretly wish that someone suggests getting oxtail afterward, because every time, I hold out hope that the soup will find that perfect balance.",

    "text": "First time I came here was over the summer of last year. Boyfriend was craving Oxtail soup and wanted me to try it since I have never had it in my life!   It was a little after 2:00am when we arrived here, and no joke this place was hopping. The line was long and the wait was about 15mins to get a table. Everyone was there from old to the very young. The hostess was nice as she sat us toward the back of the dining room. Now I am not one to complain about where I eat, but some of you might turn your nose up and the place. First of all, this is not new Vegas, its old Vegas. Things are well taken care of in this place (think Denny's) but have an older feel. They have midnight specials, which cannot be beat by anyone else around town! Cheap prices on good cooking!  Our waiter was nice, as he brought us water and our silverware! Boyfriend ordered two bowls of their oxtail soup and two sides of rice.   When the waiter brought our bowls to the table, all I could think was. How am I going to finish all this? There sitting in front of me was a piping hot and smelling delicious oversized bowl of  the tenderness looking meat sitting on the bone (psst don't tell anyone but I found out that it isn't really ox meat it's the meat from a cow)with cilantro, carrots and mushrooms.   The side bowl of sticky rice was piled high. The rice was okay did not eat much of it, but the soup was fully loaded with flavor definitely leaving the bones in makes the broth that much better.   Since this was my first time eating the meat from the soup, I was not as graceful as my boyfriend was while eating it. Instead, I tore into it with a knife and fork and when that did not work, I used my fingers to get the meat off the bone. Yes, I am not happy to admit that but just could not think of putting the bone near my mouth and chomp chomping away at it!   Not 100% full we decided on having a little sweet snack before leaving. Ordered the banana fritters, which were pretty filling as I could only managed to eat two before being totally full!  Make a note people before coming here: Oxtail soup is not served during the day it is only served after 11:00pm...    This place is totally worth going to DTLV for late at night!",

Usually I would order their awesome oxtail soup, but when I was about to put my order in, I saw the waitress hand another customer the new york strip special. It looked really good...  Ok, by the time my order came through, the waitress was able to drop about 5 orders of oxtail to other table. Wow, I thought, they must be taking extra good care of my food...  When I received my meal, I first tried the green beans. I will say this again, nothing is worse than frozen green beans. When you reheat them, they might look like fresh green beans, but they tasted like chewing on a sock. Horrible.  Let me get to the steak. I don't know where these Vegas casinos are getting their NY steaks, whether it's the California, South Point, Station Casinos or whatever.. I know it's all coming from the same damn place. Tough, leathery, and extremely fatty (on the outside of the steak..)  I gave this place 2 stars because they didn't screw up the french fries.  Two words when you go to this place, Oxtail, and Soup. That's all you need to remember. If I would have ordered that I would have given this place the 5 stars it deserves.",

The restaurant has an air of what Las Vegas was 25 years ago: all about cheap diner food, plastic upholstery, and indifferent service. Little things took too long: ice water, coffee, food and the check. My scrambled eggs were cooked unevenly, done in some respects, less so in others, and overall flavorless. Pancakes were dry, and the \"bagel\" was just white bread molded into a disc. My wife's hash browns were alternatively burned deep brown or raw in the middle.  Food was not presented all at the same time: I sat with a bready, flavorless bagel for 5 minutes after my wife got her plate.  The restaurant gives an air of indifference to the meal; as long as they give you \"something\", they have done their job, I suspect they perceive. Would neither return nor recommend. Much better options in the immediate walkable area.",

Not disappointing at all, the meat was really good  and the serving is huge.  I almost wanted to order another meal on the side since I was pretty hungry.  Glad I didn't.  Also they serve rice on the side and you can trade it for brown rice, which is a huge plus for me.  By the way the dish plus tips and tax for a total of $12.  Totally worth it, will find time to eat it again.    They also got NY steak for like $7, seems like a lot of good options to choose from.  I think I will get the oxtail soup again next time I come, but hope I can being a friend or two here next time so I can have them try the other dishes.

It was moderately busy, so I understood.   I got seated and began looking over the menu. Within a minute, the busboy came to find out my drink order. Coffee. Cool. Thank you.   Literally, as he's walking away, my server is hot on his heals to find out my order.  My initial thought \"awww she's intent\". I explained I had just sat down and I'd need a few minutes.   Let's fast forward about 20 minutes (cause literally ... NOTHING HAPPENED) to the moment the busboy came back to observe that my menu was placed down on the table and I was looking a tad bit neglected and lonely. That's right ... she didn't return in a few minutes. He told me he'd take my order since she didn't return. I placed my order and he gave me a salad bar for free.   I went to the salad bar and prepared my salad and returned to my table. I didn't prepare a small salad. It was size-able and actually pretty good. Took me about 15 minutes to eat. I waited an additional 10 minutes and see her coming with a plate of food and puts it in front of me. It wasn't what I ordered. It was close, though. I explained that this was not what I ordered. She stepped back and told me what I actually ordered. Uh. Yeah, that's it.   5 paragraphs and 59 (my food arrived at the 50 minute mark of this writing) minutes later, I have what I ordered, and it's not the best I've eaten, but also not the worst. I'm sort of disappointed in the service alone. I do appreciate the free salad though.   My order was country fried steak. She brought me fried chicken. The coffee was terrible.",

I would certainly recommend this place for a casual, decent dinner, but our wait was about 45 minutes even though they said it would be 20.  Although smoking is not allowed in the restaurant, the line for the restaurant is actually in the casino, so the smoke was HORRIBLE.  I had to stand in the restaurant (I am allergic to smoke), while my partner had to stand on line in the acrid smoke of the casino.

As good as Mama made, maybe better?  Market Street Cafe is located inside one of the smaller, older casinos downtown, The California Hotel.  We went on a rainy Monday night after a show, and there was absolutely no line to contend with. I consider our timing lucky after reading all the reviews about the wait.  The bowl is a deep, ~ 8\" bowl, filled with lots of meaty, fall off the bone oxtail and an exceptional tasting beef broth.  It also had carrots and celery.  I don't know if the veggies are always this way, but ours were slightly undercooked, still crunchy.  Just the way I love it.  You are also given a bowl of steamed white rice, a small cup of cilantro and even smaller \"pill\" cup filled with pulverized fresh ginger.  Sink your teeth into those bones, then slurp away!  If I had any complaints, it would be.... I couldn't finish it.  Ended up bringing half of it home with us.  And.....our dogs suddenly forgave our being away for 3 days, they were in hog heaven with the bones.  And the leftovers were just as good as the first time around.    You have far better odds of feeling like a winner by joining the soup squad than gambling. Yum!",

We are Vegas travelers as we come here every year from the Midwest. Typically 1 to 3 times a year and this I'd my husband's and I must stop place to eat for every trip.  The lines get very long and they don't go in order either. The last time we came was for labor day weekend and we waited just a little over an hour to be seated for 3 ppl. I feel the service is a hit or miss as well as some of these ladies aren't the nicest ppl. They lacked the customer service and even just a friendly smile. Maybe they don't care bc they know ppl will still be returning to eat there?  Anyways, we always come to get the oxtail soup, which is priced at $9.99. Really good price for the amount of oxtail they give you! They're consistent as  as everytime we have gone, it has tasted the same. This is a great place to eat after a night of drinking. One of my friends even got a steak dinner for $6.99, you can't beat that! We even took our friends that visited Vegas for their first time and they loved it!",

After recovering from a nasty cold, I decided to drop in for, of course, the oxtail soup. To be real, its not that outstanding. The broth is very simple with a skimpy addition of some veggies, but the oxtail bones are so soft and meaty which is all I really care about.  Here's where things went wrong. Let me first mention that the soup was warm, not hot. There was also a black hair in my soup but I couldn't be sure where it came from. It could've been mine for all I know, so I didn't complain. By the time I got home, I was feeling a bit queasy but attempted to sleep it off. I woke up a couple hours later because I was feeling really nauseous and ended up puking 5 times!!!   Officially scarred for life. Never going back.",

Then I looked over the menu although I knew what I wanted. 30 minutes later the hostess noticed I was still sitting there with the menu at the end of the table waiting to put my order in. She notified the server who got around to my table another ten minutes after that. I ordered my soup and by this time I'm super hungry. It took 30 more minutes just to bring out the soup. Meanwhile I'm seeing all these people around me getting their orders, I've been here over an hour now and no food, no refill on water, nothing. When I finally got my order I had to bug my server again to get the check. I won't be coming back here again.",

I should have listened because it was just ok, and not warm. Another member of our table ordered a hamburger and was told that \"the hamburger is not fresh so have to cook it at least medium so you won't get sick.\"   So, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas--that includes this horrendous restaurant. I give one star as an acknowledgement to the hardworking, friendly staff.  If the management was forced to experience what the customer experiences they wouldn't eat here either.",

They also give you some veggies to add to your soup if you want and it already comes with a bowl of white rice. One order of oxtail soup is good enough for two people.  Depending on the time you go, the line can be pretty long. It can go by fast, but prepared to wait. The servers are very nice! and they pretty much expect that you are there for their oxtail soup.",

So fast it came before the appetizer!  But the food was luke warm and my sis-n-law sent her green beans and mashed potatoes back because they were cold. She received a replacement but it was only slightly warmer.  Her salmon was good. We honestly believe this may be a Las Vegas thing as most food is not piping hot.  I had the short ribs with rice, macaroni salad and green beans.  It was satisfying but wish all of it had more seasoning. My husband and his other sister had their \"famous\" oxtail soup and they wished it had more seasoning also (even after adding the parsley and garlic they give you on the side).  Wish this experience would have been much better!",

This place reminds me of Zippy's in Hawaii. It's basically Hawaiian fare. I got the spaghetti with chili which they advertise is with zippy's chili and my husband ate their breakfast buffet.  For me, Zippy's chili really isn't all that great so the meal was whatever. At least it was hot instead of the lukewarm chili I was served in Honolulu.  For the buffet it was basic stuff. The Portuguese sausage was a bit salty. The corn beef hash is the kind from the cab but I kind of live that stuff so I was fine with it.  Prices are pretty cheap. Service was quick and courteous.  Food itself was whatever unless you miss island food.",

I only knew about this place through a friend and who knew that there would be a 40 minute wait at 12:30am?! The line wrapped around the corner and into the casino. I had to wonder if this place was that good. They only serve the oxtail soup starting at 11:00pm until the next morning. The prices are pretty decent here but I believe everyone just comes here for the oxtail soup for 10.99. This place reminded me of a casino near my mother in laws house where all the Filipinos go to gamble and then eat at after they're done playing.   We ordered a bowl of oxtail soup and a plate of spaghetti and meatballs. The oxtail soup came out fairly quickly and had huge chunks of fall in your mouth, tender pieces of oxtail. It came with a bowl of rice and some garnishes of cilantro and minced ginger. The soup is actually pretty flavorful and the oxtail was sooo tender. I didn't have much high expectations of it because of its location but boy was I wrong. It was probably one of the best meals we've had in Vegas. Flavor was just right and they gave you huge portions. No wonder everyone was getting it! The spaghetti and meatballs was nothing special. I was just craving it. But I definitely see why people go here just for their oxtail soup. Will definitely recommend this place for those late night hangovers!",

First night we arrived, I had the braised shortribs and it was fantastic.  For breakfast the next morning, I got the steak and eggs, and for my last night in Vegas, I got the Prime Rib.  The food is always cooked perfectly and the food tastes great.  The salad bar is a little weird and as there are many different salads, mac, regular, broccoli salad, and fruit salad, but not much ingredients to make your own salad besides the basics, lettuce, tomato, and salad dressing.  When you see it for yourself, you will understand what I mean.  I suggest eating at the bar as it is much faster then waiting for a table unless you are in a group of people.  Drink service is also faster at the bar.",

    "text": "After that amazing Rise Festival event, a unanimous agreement: OXTAIL SOUP.   Where else to get this in Vegas but the California Hotel.    Luckily for us, it was Friday, so we knew it was going to be served ALL DAY.   Unluckily for us, however, we had to wait in line for about 45 minutes.   It's been about 20 years since I last came through. I remember the soup tasting different (not necessarily worse) from the few times I had it before. I was surprised to find this cafe all extended and huge now. It used to be this humble small place. I'm assuming since word on the oxtail got out, it just went boomin'.   Party of 8 seated at the very back. We all pretty much knew what we were gonna get. 6/8 were oxtail soup. (The others decided to get something else and hoped for someone to share their soup with them.)   It didn't take long before we all got our food. And just like 2 decades ago, this soup was AMAZING. The meat was cooked tender. The soup was a bit on the bland side but nothing a little salt couldn't fix. (We all would have loved to have had fish sauce. Sadly, that wasn't an option. Yeah. We asked.)   Definitely worth the 45-minute wait.   I didn't catch our server's name, but she came off with an attitude. I personally didn't have a problem with her since I didn't pay her much attention, but noticed she was a little snappy with a couple of people in our party. She had that annoyed look like she hated having to serve us at 2am. Didn't see a single smile. My friend was having stomach problems all day and asked if she can take her oxtail soup to go. Server responded with a stern brash, \"No.\" (Not True. Some took their leftovers home.) But the cherry on top!? She snatched a menu outta the hands of one person in my party. (She had put in an order but wanted something else. Server assumed she was done ordering hence the snatching!)   Needless to say, that move cut her tip down.   FOOD: 5 (based on the oxtail soup + rice.) SERVICE: 2. Miss attitude.  VALUE: 3.  PARKING: Structure. There is a fee.  OVERALL: 3.25.   The rating would have been higher if our server didn't suck.    But definitely coming back for that soup. And I'm definitely going to do everything to avoid getting served by Miss \"I-don't-wanna-be-here.\"",

Luckily, they are open super late and we were able to check it out the next evening. I just went to Hawaii the previous year so I was eager to see if their food could meet my expectations and it was good! I didn't get to try the oxtail soup, but I ordered the Loco Moco and it really hit the spot! This place is like any typical diner, except it serves up pretty decent Hawaiian food, and it's fairly cheap. It was surprisingly difficult to find places to eat past 2am in Vegas, so one great aspect about it is it's hours! It's also pretty large so there's plenty of dining space.",

    "text": "Just returned from my Vacations Hawaii trip for a class reunion...Went here 3 times out of the 5 nights of the trip, one breakfast and two lunches.   For the breakfast, I just wanted coffee and stack of hotcakes...coffee was refilled often and was pleased.  For lunch a few days later, after eating so many buffets at the Main St Station and Fremont, I decided I just wanted something small, so I chose Fried Saimin. The menu said it included shrimp, not knowing they'd give me 6 full sized shrimp. Wow! It came on an oval plate, and for $5.99, I have to say whoa..that's a lot of fried noodles with char siu, etc. It was just too much that I had the rest taken in a goody bag, it was just that much!    A day later, I came again with my brother and we had the reverse of what we ate previously, he had the Fried Saimin and I had the Short Rib plate at $11.99.   In this case, his Fried Saimin came on a round plate and didn't have as much as I had on my oval plate of a day prior... Why the inconsistency? As for the short rib, wow...fall off the bone delicious...only the mac/potato salad was a disappointment since it tasted nothing like what local people in Hawaii would make it taste like...strange, since I always thought Market Cafe was suppose to mimic local Hawaii foods..they got it wrong, and that ain't BEST FOODS mayonaise..   Best feature of all, all the meals were covered with our breakfast or lunch vouchers from Vacations Hawaii, only thing we gave were the tips to the server.   It's a go to place when I stay in Downtown Vegas, but wish they'd improve on the mac salad.   I'll still give them 4 stars!",

We got in line behind maybe like 6 groups ahead of us, and they seated us all at the same time in one wave.  I def recommend the oxtail soup. The menu's huge, so there's a lot of different things you can get... but if you're going to come to Market Street Cafe, then get something you won't get at your normal diner like Denny's. The portions are pretty nice for the price. :)",

I ordered the Filipino breakfast with tocino. They give you a small container of fried garlic, so you can choose between garlic rice or plain white rice. It was just okay.

Definitely will sober that Ass up so you won't be too hungover the next day. (now you can drink all night and do it again!)  This place is located in the California Hotel in olddd asss Vegas.  The side where all the newbies to Vegas rarely visit, or probably don't even know about. The restaurant has a good menu selection, American food, Hawaiian and even Filipino items. Great late night eats.    We went to this spot two nights in a row.  Each night I tried different things but my group got the oxtail soup both nights!                                                                  First night I had the steak and eggs. 8 oz.  Is what was advertised for the steak but when I got it, I swear they must've weighed it on a broken scale.  That thing was a snack for me. The second night I opted for a pastrami sandwich, they got that on point.  Maybe next time I'll actually try their oxtail soup. I have no clue why I didn't get, I mean it must have been worth it since we went their two nights in a row for it.   Oxtail runs ya about 10 bucks a bowl. Served with rice.   Vegas: get drunk, dance the night away, get drunk some more. Get oxtail soup. Sleep and repeat.",

Of course, u have ur prime rib, turkey, ham...best, pepper encrusted prime rib (so far, the best prime rib at a buffet).  The salad bar was the biggest disappointment...if u want plain greens w/out any garnishing (tomatoes, cucumber, peas, etc) than, you will love it.  They need to expand their salad bar. They seem to be slim on selections, rather limited. I liked the dessert bar but, need to refresh the goodies.  It's been sitting out a little too long, most of the desserts were getting hard n dry. Rather disappointing but, nostalgia brings me back.",

I had the Prime Rib $9.99 special the next evening. That was good too. In fact the portion size was supposed to be 8 ounces. It was a lot bigger.

It always has been a comfort spot to eat at simply because I'm from Hawaii, and hearing all the pidgin and seeing all the Hawaii folks as I eat my saimin drowned in hot mustard (not the kind of hot mustard that literally tastes like mustard), causing me to put my hands on my forehead as I go into convulsion until the hotness wears out. If you know, you know what I'm talking about. Good stuff.  Lines can be pretty long but to me, for the most part...moves at a good pace. Service isn't so bad either. Out of all the million times we've been...it's been pretty personable. Never had a rude waiter/waitress. Has a decent menu similar to foods found at a Dennys or some sort. However, I'd prefer to eat here over a 'Dennys or some sort' because of the other food options like a tocino breakfast, zippys chili, and specials like their miso butterfish. Us Hawaii folks living out in the desert always appreciates some nostalgia or likeness to home.   They have pretty good walkway space between tables so if you must bring your stroller in, don't feel afraid to do so. If you got those.humongous double side-to-side kine strollers...leave 'um brah.  4 stars for offering oxtail soup and zippys chili and zippys style spaghetti. But overall, it's a 3.5 stars spot. If you aren't in the vicinity, there's no need to rush on down...unless you're in the vicinity and you've had a night of gambling and drinking while family is in town, and need some soup to sober up. =D  Then I'd definitely recommend.

Rudeness and waiting forever, they weren't even that busy the first day.   Saimin is basically a noodle package that they don't even stir around so when you get it, it's like a block of overcooked noodles.  Same thing with soup or fried versions. The menu was limited as to what you could get.   The eggs for scrambled tasted like a carton of eggs not fresh. White or wheat toast only. Bacon was thin and not crispy. Hash browns were stale tasting on the crispy aide. Almost as if they had been cooked and were now being re cooked.   The fountain drinks were loosing their fizz and taste. So the syrup definitely needed to get swapped.   The food a lot of the times would not come out very hot, but warm like it had been sitting under the lamps too long.",

For what you pay (dirt cheap) & what you get...........it's a real good bargain!

We ordered the prime rib special and asked to substitute veggies for the green beans since my bf hates green beans and I was sick of them after eating his sides of green beans for the past few days. Plus the green beans here are of cheap quality. They could not substitute, but gave us the salad bar at no extra charge.  The prime rib was cooked nicely and came with a side of dipping juice and horseradish. We also got cherries jubilee as a dessert and that was a delectable treat.  Although the lines moved slowly when paying the bill and checking out, they moved more quickly when we entered and were waiting to be seated.",

    "text": "Being a native from Hawaii, sometimes I crave a Hawaiian style breakfast.  I'm fortunate to live in downtown Fremont where there is a casino hotel that caters to the Hawaiian community, The Californian.  Inside there's a restaurant I go to have breakfast before I go to work.  The Market street cafe has many local Hawaiian offerings, the Oxtail soup being the signature star of their menu offerings. [Note: this oxtail soup is offered after midnight through until 9am, perfect of your coming in from a night of partying in Las Vegas, sober up with this amazing soup!]  The menu has many delicious choices to choose from and the prices are amazingly low.  Because I'm usually in a hurry, I opt for the breakfast buffet. It's just below $7.00 and your choices are awesome!  Eggs, rice, Portuguese sausage, corned beef and hash, biscuits, gravy, cheese blintz, French toast sticks, fruit, cottage cheese, pastries, etc.  If I go on, I might get hungry again...lol  The customer service is ok, mother worth mentioning in this review. I feel many of the employees have been there for years and just go through the \"motions\" and don't really give that WOW experience.  No matter, let the food and the pricing be the spotlight of your experience!  Enjoy!  :)",

Like other yelpers has mentioned, the oxtail soup is a graveyard special and it is only serve between 11PM-9AM. If you decide to come in the morning, make sure to come before 8AM. There will be a line around 830AM from all the early risers and everyone that is trying to catch the special. You don't want to miss it.   Onto the oxtail soup, it is nicely cooked. So tender and broth is clean. It usually come with a bowl of rice but I ordered ramen on the side. I loved it with the ramen. I personally think this is better than the famous oxtail ramen in Oahu. Last but not least, it's only $10 + $2 for the side of ramen. If you're in the area, make sure to stop by for some oxtail soup!!",

We came in just for the ox tail soup only to find out it wont be served till 11pm so we had to settle. So I had the Loco Moco which is terrible. They gave me burnt patty and to relieve it, they just dumped a whole lotta gravy on top to cover it up. Just because you cover it with gravy does not mean you cannot taste the burnt patty... It didnt help that its a burnt patty with no flavor what so ever, I guess the flavor was suppose to be with the gravy but nopes not good at all. My boyfriend had the chicken fried steak which was overly salted; salt everywhere, on the green beans the mashed potatos the gravy and chicken, everywhere. You can see the salt granules on the green beans.   Tried multiple times to get our waitress attentiom but it looked like she ignored us or didnt want to acknowledge us. Never saw her again after she served us our food. Didnt even ask how our food is, if we could we would have just told her about our displeasure with our food.  Welps, never coming back here again even if people say the ox tail soup is the \"best\".",

Prime Rib came out medium rare as requested but was tough and lacked flavor, just a piece of meat...

Servers were friendly, but it could be hard to get their attention because they were busy. They refilled our waters often though, so that was good. I had the oxtail soup with brown rice. The soup was a bit salty at first, but eating it with rice made it perfect. Free refill on rice...  The oxtail was huge, lots of meat, tender and fall off the bone. It came with celery, carrots and mushrooms. Cilantro and ginger were on the side. Ask for chili paste if you like spicy.",

Located inside California Hotel & Casino on the ground floor.  Additional info in response to management: My review is for breakfast only.  This is definitely a restaurant I would return to. It has a price point that allows for repeat visits.   For ranking purposes, I consider Market Street Cafe better than the typical Denny's, but not quite as good as Claim Jumper.  This is a good niche to be in and I believe they execute it well. For routine breakfast, I would rather dine at a modestly priced 3-star restaurant than a higher priced 4-star place (I'll splurge for occasional events). Hence, I came here instead of returning to Claim Jumper for breakfast (even though Claim Jumper's breakfast was slightly better).",

The sauce is a good teriyaki sauce I love.   The restaurant is a little funny about putting large groups of tables together. We came with a groups of 89 club friends. Getting a table for 8 or 10 Is a feat.   Get the raspberry ice tea. Very refreshing.",

I have tried to find other places that can top the oxtail soup here but I have found none. They have other local menu from breakfast like Portuguese sausage and eggs to dinner like Loco Moco. But that oxtail soup really hits you different (especially when it's 4am and there's more alcohol in you than there is anything else). Service is good also, very fast but servers do need to pay attention to their table a little more, like napkins or water refills. Also, expect a wait, especially late at night. The place does get a bit crowded and you have to line up for a table. But very worth it!",

I wasn't really expecting a line at all, much less one as long as I experienced at 12:30am and, at first, I didn't understand why.  Then a friend explained that apparently their oxtail soup is the bomb and that explained the line.   Anyhow, I was just there to sit with my friends while they enjoyed their entrees.  Surprisingly, only 2 of them actually ordered the oxtail soup.  They seemed to enjoy it but the only reason that it was better in their opinion was that the \"tail\" was larger than they could get back at home in Honolulu.  Other than that, they weren't overly impressed.  The decor was old school and matched up well with the rest of the California Hotel.  Service was good and pleasant.  Our server was very upbeat and attentive, especially for 1:15am.  I didn't even realize that they offered dessert until I asked and was excited that they offered a banana split for $4.99 (a virtual bargain).  I enjoyed it very much.  I'm not sure if I will be visiting the California and Market Street again, but if I do, I wouldn't mind giving the dinner menu a shot.",

Everyone wants their grub on their legendary oxtail soup.   It took me several attempts before I was finally able to try this amazing soup. Its due to its limited availability. Even though the restaurant itself is open 24/7, the oxtail soup can only be ordered from 11pm until 8am. On a few occasions I went to vegas, these hours were not the most convenient for me.   Until recently that I was able to stay in vegas longer than usual, I was able to finally dine in here. As expected, we were in line before 11pm but were seated promptly as soon as they opened.  Our server was very friendly. We placed our order for four bowls of soup and a steak combo. The soup which was served with ginger and cilantro, was as good as I have imagined. It had lots of oxtail meat, the broth was rich and it was very flavorful.   So happy to be able to try it. I can't wait for my next vegas trip so I can enjoy the soup once again.",

The food was palatable but nothing better then Denny's.  Gross food can be acceptable if the service is adequate but this place had neither good food nor service.   Problem with casino restaurants is that no body cares and they won't do anything about it.  They will keep getting new customers by default.  I've noticed The California's food quality plummet in the last 10-12 months.  The little cafe in the corner of the casino on the SE side used to have pretty decent food.  I tried this place as well and the food is just awful - same cook though.  Well, California you have lost one previously loyal customer.  This place sucks. How pathetic",

Heres the trick.. it's served from 11pm - 11 am every day.  So it's all a crap shoot but try going around 3 or 4am the line might be shorter AND it gives the ox tails a few more hours to stew and get softer. Mmm... ox tails...  or even go in the morning before lunch..   as a whole the place is okay nothing fancy, don't expect too much.  maybe even 2 stars if it wasn't for the ox tail soup.  Just stick to the plan... don't stray from the path... stick to what works.. The specials... NY Steak, Prime Rib, and Ox Tail soup (sorry i forgot what time the NY steak and Prim Rib specials are)  here is a list of the nightly specials <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.boydgaming.net%2Fcalifornia%2Fmedia%2Fdownloads%2FMSC_dsi_10_2009_01.pdf&s=180d343d05b975aecfaadbb0494f3fe0fad2833027f25122ec6049fce75bae0b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">static.boydgaming.net/ca...</a>  I tried the friday special \"Kalbi and huli huli chicken\" not that great, i have to say... it was definitely not hulu huli chicken... more of a baked teriyaki chicken?  would not get it again..  like i said, stick to the game plan..  although a few things on the list do intrigue me... Sunday, black bean sauce pork riblets, and Monday's Ox tail STEW (11AM-11PM) and i did see butterfish (Gindara or black cod) which i love in Japanese restaurants but I'm still on the fence trying it at this place.  Hey sometimes you gotta step outside the box right?!  So sooner or later i'll give these a shot.  Think i had the Tuesday night special one time too (LauLau and Chicken long rice) i think it was okay..  Pros: Late night ox tail soup, cheep breakfast buffet, Vacations Hawaii coupons if you are from Hawaii and booked thru them.   Cons: Some of the food is just okay and nothing special, so pick and choose wisely.  Tips:  1.  They offer brown rice on request, don't do it!  I don't know what kind of rice it is but it's really gross!  Maybe uncle Ben's instant brown rice??   2.  Wait a little longer to get the ox tail soup (don't go at 11 when they start offering it), it will be more tender the later you go, give it time. 3. for the ox tail extravaganza try going on a Monday for the ox tail stew 11 am -  11 pm, then the ox tail soup from 11 PM to 11 AM.",

You just walk straight across the casino and BAM, there it is on the end. Try to hold your breath while walking through the casino because it smells like 100 year old cigarette butts, ashtrays and dusty funk.  Our waitress was attentive, and she took our order pretty quickly. We ordered 3 ox tail soups, one Hawaiian breakfast and I got an extra side of hash browns. What's an after drinking meal without some kind of potatoes?  Our food came quicly and we dug right in. About half way in when I came up for air, I noticed my hash browns had not arrived. I reminded the waitress , and she brought one out right away.  I actually wished I had forgotten it all together because they were not crunchy and were more like mashed potatoes and oil on the inside.   The oxtail broth was a little on the salty side, but the oxtail itself was fall off the bone delish.  Of course it being 3am, there was a table of young guys staring impolitely at us while we were gnawing on those ox tails. One of them actually had his phone out and appeared to be snapping photos of us. Oh well.",

Things to know: 1) open ALL NIGHT LONG: great for if you're hungry after a night of dancing, just take a cab here. It's WAAYYY down the strip   2) HAWAIIAN FOOD!: they have spam and eggs, saimin, and loco moco!! definitely, gonna try this next time  3) OX TAIL SOUP: have to say, this thing was DELICIOUS!!! It's gingery so if you don't like ginger, don't order it. It even comes with a side of ginger and cilantro. It's warm and the meat is soft. Really, it's the perfect meal after a long night of singing along to your favorite DJ's songs   4) LINES GET LONG!: we waited for half an hour at around 3am...yah....probably only gets worse the later it gets  Loved this place! The place is a little run down, but it's really good! I'd definitely come again if I was willing to make the trek. Oh, and if you do decide to come here, there's validated free parking!",

    "text": "I've eaten here 7-8 times over the last 10yrs but can only review based on the prime rib special which gas varied in price from 7-10.00 over the yrs.  Here's a quick breakdown: Restaurant ambience- similar to a Cocos or Dennys, you will hear your table neighbor's conversation and visa versa Service- nice but hurried and infrequent. Thats mainly because the place is usually packed Prime Rib- pretty good for casino special prime rib (much different from the steakhouse variety). My recommendation is if you want medium rare ask for rare, want medium ask for medium rare, ect. I learned the hard way by asking for medium well a couple times and I got what most outside of the caveman era would consider well done.  Salad bar- at its best average at its worst,  umm lets just say cousin Eddie from Vegas Vacation migh t consider it to cross contaminated to dine from.  Cherries Jubilee- this comes with special. Its a large scoop of vanilla with heated cherries on the bottom and whipped cream. A really nice addition to the special and though I'm not a big dessert person I do enjoy this little bonus.  In summary if you want a meal that is going to be a great value and get you full in a no frills environment then MSC hits the spot. Also I assume the Oxtail is great because every time I'm there half the place is chin deep in that stuff",

    "text": "OMG. I absolutely love oxtail soup! My Mom used to make it when we were kids and she rocked that dish!  So, after a long night of dancing at Tao, a bunch of us headed here for the famous oxtail soup!  There was a long ass line and it was 4 am. I think we waited about 30-40 minutes. I was tired and cranky already, so wasn't too happy for the wait.  But, when we sat down and ordered, the food came within 10 minutes.   It was so good! I loved the oxtail, perfectly cooked and huge, seasoned well and had good meat and some fat on it. There were about 6 oxtails per soup, but I was only able to finish 3 1/2 tails. I loved the minced ginger and cilantro on the side. It gave the soup a nice kick.   Sigh.. I wish I could have some now. $8 for a bowl of oxtail goodness!  pix- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpandaliciousforme.blogspot.com&s=1c864409f412873687ee8e711cb9fbd7ecc24e9d77a554900d76429edec04db7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pandaliciousforme.blogsp...</a>",

The meal includes soup or a trip to the salad bar which is quite decently stocked. The entree includes both a seasonal vegetable and a choice of baked potato or rice. Lastly they give you cherries jubilee as well. Who needs a buffet when this fills you up and is just as tasty (if not more so, depending on which buffet). Lastly, service is always with a smile.

The oxtail soup is why I always go here, and evidently the reason why everyone else goes here.      After a long drive from California, this dish surely hits the spot.  With tender oxtail meat, carrots, celery, ginger, peanuts in a flavorful broth....I have reason to sleep well afterwards.  There have been a few times when the meat doesn't fall off the bone though.  But most of the time it does.  With 2 scoops of rice and a side of cilantro and minced ginger, about $8 is still worth it...even when I used to pay about $6 back in the day.    I've also ordered the steak graveyard special, breakfast, and the banana fritters platter.  For $4, you can't go wrong with these cheap eats.  They definitely fill you up after a long drive or after gambling all night.  The service here is okay, pretty friendly staff.  Expect a long line at around 11 PM, when the oxtail soup is available, but if you're there around 3 AM like I usually am, its smooth sailing.  If you end up waiting long, many \"locals\" will tell you that it's worth the wait.",

When I mom asked for a box the waitress took 15 minutes to get one her response was \"There were none in the kitchen I had to grab from the storage\" to me that's unacceptable if the supply get low restock it hello common sense don't wait last minute.

    "text": "Drove to Las Vegas from Anaheim on Thanksgiving Day.  We had no idea what we were going to do for food.  We, of course, were hoping to find a turkey dinner, but did not know it that was in the cards.  After getting settled at our hotel, we got back in the car and headed to downtown (so much cooler than the Strip).  We wandered through Main Street Station and then over to the California.  Somewhere along the way, we saw a sign for the Market Street Cafe, offering a turkey dinner for $10.99!  \"Score!,\" said we.   We could not think of a more perfect option for Thanksgiving in Vegas.  Despite the maze outside that suggests you must sometimes wait in line for a table, we were seated immediately at a comfy table towards the rear of the restaurant.    Service was quick and friendly.  We did not have to wait long for our turkey dinners and, frankly, they were pretty dang good.  All of the sides were tasty, but I was completely enraptured by the sweet potatoes, which is something I never cook on my own.  At the end of our main course, we were (pleasantly) surprised to learn our dinners included a slice of pie.  They were out of pumpkin pie, but I was able to get a slice of the custard pie, which I probably would have ordered anyhow.  It was not too sweet, which is just the way I like it, and quite yummy.  One odd thing:  The menu states \"cocktails are available 24 hours a day,\" and I ordered a glass of red wine ($3.50!) to have with my meal.  The waiter told me it must be served by the cocktail waitress and would be a separate check.  \"No problem,\" said I.  And, I waited, and waited, and waited some more for my drink.  The waitress finally appeared, just as I was getting close to finishing my meal.  She apologized and said someone else had called in sick and said she was the only waitress on duty that night and was being run ragged.  \"No problem,\" said I, again.  The wine was served in a plastic cup, and, this being Vegas, I was able to take it to go.  In addition to the decent food, good service, comfortable setting,  and beyond decent prices, we ended up having a nice chat with the folks sitting at the table next to ours.  We very much enjoyed our experience at the Market Street Cafe and, were we to return to Las Vegas, would definitely stop in again.",

    "text": "Drinking on Fremont Street and visiting the California Hotel for oxtail soup has become synonymous with each other. Nothing beats a large steaming bowl of meaty broth on a cold night either. The added garnishes of chopped ginger, fresh garlic, and cilantro makes the broth better. For such a complex dish, it is a bummer that the liquid tastes like straight up beef broth from the store. Other than that, the whole experience was great. The Asian fried chicken was moist and flavorful. It comes with a side of vegetables and a choice of carb. The NY steak is nothing to right home about and was not cooked to our specification, but it was decent. I would suggest one of the two first items.  The service is attentive and quick. We were able to get in and out within an hour. The best part is that three meals cost a total of $26. Late night menus are the best to soak up all the alcohol and prevent hangovers.",

After that, most poeple get the Oxtail soup for their late night specials.        - Prime Rib and Steak - Better get it medium rare or below or it'll probably be pretty dry.        - Line - During rush hour, there is a pretty lengthy line. I'd recommend coming right before or after that.  **Ordered**        - $9.99 CAL Prime Rib - Decent Prime rib for the price. Served with salad bar, side, and their cherries jubilee dessert. This is a very popular choice since their salad bar and dessert are so good.        - $14.50 One Pound T-Bone Steak - Served with salad bar and side. It's a large steak for the price. It's not top notch, but I'd get it again.  **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap bite to eat. Value over quality is what you're getting here.",

Because of my underwhelming experience with the Portuguese sausage at the Garden Court Buffet (see review), I asked my server if it was spicy as I prefer it. She couldn't say for sure as, not surprisingly, both hotels used the same product but encouraged me to try it anyway. So I ordered that along with a stack of pancakes. As it turns out, the sausage was pretty good while the pancakes were just okay. The meal did serve its purpose, keeping me filled for several hours.   If you're already staying at the California or Main Street Station, or just went on a long gambling run at either, it's probably a decent, convenient choice to get some grub. I just won't order the pancakes again! LOL",

Wow, there were other inexpensive things on the menu too, but I didn't really notice them.  My friends and I were just there for some cheap eats after a long day in Vegas.  Our total came out to be less than $19 for THREE people.  That's awesome!  The servers were prompt and courteous.  They came back to check up on us and to refill our water.  The cafe itself was pretty big and there was a line that moved pretty quickly.  I like how they run their place.  I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas.  Oh yah, if you arrive before 11PM, you can get a prime rib dinner for about $8 I think.",

I thought the food would compensate for it but even the wait for the food was long and when I finally got it, it wasn't even good. I ordered the golden shrimp w clam chowder, mashed potatoes and string beans. Clam chowder was salty. Mashed potatoes were okaaaay. String beans were soggy, and the shrimp? Not even crunchy. Funny texture and just not good. The woman serving my table wasn't even a good waitress either. She mentioned her shift almost being over when I asked how her shift was going. Also, when she was serving us our food, she literally handed one of the plates to my cousin rather than placing her food ON the table in front of her. She didn't even state which plate was who's when she gave us our food. My cousin also asked a diff waitress for napkins and the waitress didn't even make eye contact w her and when she gave my cousin the napkins, she literally just placed it on the table and left. AAAAAND, when our waitress came back, after serving us our food, she didn't bother coming back to ask how it was. Lastly, she didn't come back to refill our waters at all. We had to ask. Overall a 1. I would give this place half of a star if I could, honestly. I'm very generous w my reviews too! But this place is just not it.",

For $9.99 I had about 8 pieces of oxtail, a rich  broth with really deep developed flavor.  The veggies weren't hammered to mush which was great.. Add the ginger and cilantro that is provided into the broth it is well worth it..  Its also served with rice that I put in at the end to make sure I got every drop of that broth.  The only reason they're not getting 5 stars is that the service is a bit spotty but if you're willing to wait a bit for a truly excellent bowl of soup it is well worth waiting for.  I will definitely be back",

The restaurant is nice and clean. We sat for a full 10 minutes b4 our waitress Olga even acknowledged us. She walked pass us a good 5 times, wasnt sure if she was our waitress or not. Not a i'll be right with you no water, no drink order nothing for 10 whole minutes. I dont care how good a restaurants food is if the service is bad its not worth it for me. Once our order was taken it didnt take long at all. The oxtail soup was delicious except for the oxtails which were very tough. They needed to throw them in the slow cooker or something they also needed to trim the big ones, so much fat. Now i could eat the broth, veggies & rice by itself it was really good. It came with cilantro, ginger & rice on the side for you to add in yourself.  The giant bowl of soup was $9.99 well worth it, u cant buy oxtails at the grocery store for that price, trust me i know and they give you a bowl full of them, not stingy at all. If you dont mind mediocre service go try the soup.",

Well, get out of bed and make your way to the Market Street Cafe in the California Hotel!  I think the Cal is just ok, but the main reason I keep coming back is because of this place!  I think although this diner is just ok and offers an overwhelmingly big menu, there's no question about their graveyard menu and specials.  That's why I keep coming back!  On Sunday, I came and got the Oxtail Soup and a cup of the chili, as I always get every single time like clockwork.  The total came to about $15.  I ALWAYS have a great time with the Oxtail soup.  This soup is filled with pine nuts, carrots, celery and huge pieces of oxtail!  They serve it with cilantro and ginger.  I can't enough of it!  The oxtail is super moist and marbleized.  I often times have dreams about it! LOL.  The chili is good because it's the Zippy's style chili back home in Hawaii.  The chili is super creamy and I heard they actually put peanut butter in the recipe to help with the creaminess.    Remember what I said.  If you find yourself hungry for some local Hawaiian food, get your butt to Market Street Cafe.  They're open 24 hours a day and will surely help satisfy your cravings, BRAH!",

The line was ridiculously long for the time of night it was, but it made sense since they only serve OX Tail from 11pm-9am. Anyway the host sat us at the very first booth right by the line and closet to the cashier. We think it was a trap to make us have a bad experience....seriously we waited for 20 minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge our existence, she was nice. But nice didn't get us our food before people that got there at the same time as us Had already ordered, eaten and left.... We finally ordered, got our food maybe another 15 minutes after. At this point were just hungry, she then says \" I have a big party back there (I'm guessing the main dining area)  so it's okay if I don't come back\" I was confused at first and when she left I turned to my boyfriend and asked if she really just said that? That was a little much for me, I'm all about service and although she was nice, I still wanted to walk out. She was totally serious too, she walk by one time very quickly and said are you good and walked a way again. She never came back, in fact my boyfriend had to get up after waiting for the check for a good 15 more minutes and find her to get the bill.... Really???? Ugh! What a night ruiner. Anyway moral of the story, don't sit in the booths in front of the restaurant unless you want to be stuck in limbo for a good portion of your night.  #byefelicia#illmakemyownd**msoup",

    "text": "Oxtail soup and prime rib. That's all you need to know.   This place is located on the ground floor in the Cal and is 24 hours. The staff is very friendly. There's first come first serve bar seats or you can wait for a table.   The prices here are cheap. You can get a pretty good meal for under $10 or you can get meal coupons too if you get a hotel package.   I like that this place has a salad bar which comes with all the entrees (or you can choose soup). It has a good variety. Get the broccoli crunch salad. It's crunchy and tasty. I like getting olives, carrots and hard boiled eggs!   The saimin here is just like home in Hawaii. The prime rib special is one of my favorites. It's not bad for $10, however I've had good pieces and a few bad ones too.   The breakfast buffet is also pretty good. The bacon was crispy and they even had Portuguese sausage. But I didn't like the scrambled eggs, they were pretty runny.   And if you gamble all night long, you can get the $6.99 graveyard oxtail soup special. It starts at 11pm. I wish they served it all day.   No matter what time of day you go, it always seems to be busy.",

When we sat down to take a look at the Menu's, I decided to look on yelp and see what the reviews were. Once I saw the 4 star rating, I know I was going to be impressed.  When I said take a look at the Menu, it took awhile due to there being lots to choose from!   We had a table of 6 and we ordered pretty much everything from breakfast to lunch. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and all I have to say is WOW! These were probably the best Eggs Benedict I have tasted in a long long time. I also ordered a short stack of pancakes which were also pretty tasty.  The customer service was awesome as well!  You definitely need to stop on by if you're in the Golden Nugget!",

Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is by no means cushy, but its homely and warm. They have daily specials on various items throughout the week. Love the $6.25 breakfast buffet with all the 'local kine grindz' one would be familiar with coming from Hawaii. I lost count on how many times I've been here already since I get alot of friends from Hawaii who stay there when visiting Vegas. Their service is good, you can feel the aloha spread all around. Even if you have no idea what Hawaiian style food is but are curious. And if you're willing to make the trip to downtown Vegas, this wouldn't be a bad place to sample a few without breaking the bank.",

This is probably one of the only places in Vegas where you see and dine with other Hawaiian locals. As pretty much everyone here has said, their speciality is the oxtail soup ($9.99 or hawaiian coupon plus $3.00) starting at 11 pm. Everytime I eat it, I try to think what ingredients are making that delicious broth. Their prime rib dinner for $9.99 with soup or salad bar and dessert is a steal also. The one negative i would  say is sometimes their eggs have too much of a butter flavor. Other than that, its a simple cafe that is pretty laid back and affordable.",

The quality of prime rib was buffet style and bland. The texture was tough and fatty. The potato was as good as any other. The salad bar was mediocre. The dessert was cherries jubilee which tasted like a cafeteria dessert. My father liked his meal but he's not a foodie. My wife ate her meal without complaint, she just cut off the fat off her prime rib. I liked the portion size. There is no key.",

Their prime rib is very juicy and flavorful. The mashed potatoes are my favorite because of the gravy! it is pure deliciousness. My favorite part about the cherries jubilee is the little cookie that they serve with it. Put some of the ice cream on it, and you're in for a real treat!!  If you don't feel like eating prime rib, try some of the local food they have on the menu. Definitely worth it.   Tip: be prepared to wait for at least 15 minutes.

The graveyard steak dinner was forgettable ($7); it came with a side of fresh green beans and choice of potato.    The wait around 1 am was about 10 mins; the place was pretty full.  I was seated in Anna's section (taller, slender Caucasian woman with glasses) and she single-handedly made me dislike my dining experience.  It took nearly 40 minutes for her to come take my order and another 40 minutes for her to bring me my lukewarm food.  I'm just glad I twarted the imminent threat of having to waste another extended period of my life to get the check by asking for the check when my food came out.  I love people watching, generally, but not that night; it made me even more annoyed to see all the other servers being keenly attentive and fast and I yearned for Anna to be an iota of that.  Needless to say,  I was ridiculously generous w/ my rating of two stars; the soup was ok and the poor helpers refilling drinks were helpless in my plight but were on point with their tasks nonetheless.  If I return, I'd ask to be seated in any section NOT covered by Anna.

Las Vegas has a lot of options for late night dining but this is a great place to end your night. It's located only two blocks from the Fremont experience in the Californian casino.   The line can be long sometimes at this time of night, especially if there's an event going on in the downtown area. The trick is to designate someone to wait while the rest of your party gambles.   The service is average for a sit down cafe. As for the food, the special comes with a big bowl of oxtail and a scoop of rice.  The oxtail was juicy and tender, and the rice compliments it perfectly. I recommend ordering an extra scoop of rice to soak up all the broth. For the price, it's worth stopping by when you need something to sober you up.",

My friend and I waited for about 10 - 15 minutes to be seated which was not too bad because it was Easter Sunday.   I ordered the Steak and Eggs served with brown rice and toast. Keep in mind that the steak takes a bit of a wait because they cook accordingly to order. My friend ordered the two large grade AA eggs breakfast, served with hash brown, toast, and spam.   Our bill came out to around $20 excluding tip, which was pretty darn cheap. However, the portions were pretty small.  BTW oxtail soup is served between 11:00PM - 9:00AM ;(  As for staff they were really friendly, informative, and attentive.",

Most people come for the late night oxtail soup. Tonight I ate the mahi mahi and my wife ate the butterfish. I also got the won tins to start with. The service here is hit or miss and they can get busy. The server forgot my won tons but brought it out almost at the ending of my meal. Sorry I was so hungry that I only got to snap a quick photo of the Portuguese bean soup which was creamy and delicious. By the time I realized I didn't take a picture my plate was empty. Even if the service can be hit or miss and the wait can be long I'll definitely be back",

The soup was accompanied by a side of rice. The soup was composed of cilantro, ginger, celery, carrots and huge pieces of oxtail. It was quite delicious but I found the oxtail itself was difficult to eat as you were constantly trying to peel the meat from the caverns of the bone.   I also thought the broth could have used more flavor but generally speaking it was still good.  I wasn't able to finish my bowl because the portions were very generous.  The ginger was one of my favorite part of the dish as I thought it gave the soup a very diverse flavor.  It's good to know I have a place I can goto for good eats next time I'm in downtown Las Vegas.",

I understand people have off days, but it seemed she came to work intent to make everyone that she encountered, upset. She did NOT greet us at all, did not even give us a smile. In fact what she did give us was a very unwelcomed feeling. Upon asking us how much in our party, she then proceeded to state that they (the restaurant) didn't have any open tables other than where she was planning on seating us. Despite the entire lower part and back part of the restaurant being unoccupied. We didn't say anything negative despite her attitude, in fact my mother and father were quite polite to her in thanking her for seating us in the area she, in my opinion gave us no choice anyway to sit in. She walked away mumbling under her breath, I'm assuming in response to hearing me say that I felt she seemed cranky this morning. She was then approached by an elderly gentleman of Asian descent (who was dining alone by the way) who politely asked if he could be seated in the lower level and she told him in a very rude manner \"No! That section is closed because we have no waitress on duty in that section right now. This upper section is all we have available.\" And she went ahead and sat him in a table in our area. She then sat another gentleman and his wife of Asian descent, with her still very huffy unwelcoming attitude in the same area we were in. She then seated 2 older women of Caucasian descent and she looked like an absolutely different person. She was smiling, laughing and making small talk on their way to, guess where....the supposedly unmanned, unavailable lower section of the restaurant!!! She even went as far as to get them their drinks!! I was livid!!! I noticed it but my parents were on vacation from Hawaii, I live here and were spending time with them and didn't want to put a damper on their trip by making a scene about this blatantly terrible service we, as well as others who I witnessed, received from this \"hostess.\" You know people from Hawaii frequent this place because its something familiar to them and its supposed to feel welcoming not only because the restaurants slogan is \"Aloha Spoken Here\" but because the Cal is a favorite spot for them as well. But to see this hostess treat people this way is truly heartbreaking. If it wasn't for the convenience and for that voucher booklet for the meals that come with the travel package, unless they do something about that hostess I wouldn't bother with this place. I didn't catch her name because her sweater was covering it the whole time. But what I did manage to see, it was a short name starting with a \"J.\" And she was an older Caucasian lady with shoulder length dyed black frizzy hair. And she looks very tired, physically and of her job which in my opinion she needs to move on from because she is obviously unhappy with it, and is reflecting it upon those she is encountering.",

    "text": "Saturday, 8:30pm:  I had the $9.99 Prime Rib Special with unlimited salad bar, one side of baked potato or rice, one side of canned green beans, and fruit jubilee ice cream dessert. It was located at the Market Street Cafe which is open 24 hours a day.  Wait Time: At 8:30pm on Saturday night, there was a wait of about 30 mins. We would have waited longer, but were lucky because they came through the line and asked for parties of two and allowed us to skip the line. From what I hear from the cashier at exit (you self pay when you leave), she said it is \"always busy\" there. There was a line still when we left an hour later.  Appetizer: Salad Bar  The unlimited salad bar was a nice touch (3/5 stars) - it included only ice berg lettuce vs what I would have preferred to be mixed greens. There was Mac salad, potato salad, and a big bonus \"imitation crab salad\" which was surprising to me as I have rarely seen that before in a salad bar. One thing of note was that they seemed to have \"real\" diced hard boiled eggs with normal white color and yellow yolk. This is opposite to my recent experience at Sweet Tomatoes which seemed to have more processed lighter pale yellow colored yolks and very bleached egg whites. Overall the salad bar was decent but nothing to write home about.  There was no bread option included.  Main Entree: Prime Rib  Prime rib (4/5 stars) was about equivalent to a nice prime rib you would get at a good buffet and possibly 2 steps below the famous House of Prime Rib in SF (which btw costs like 6x the cost). I would say it is about 10oz in size, medium cut.  Sides:  Green beans (2/5 stars) - The likely canned green beans were not as good as the ones you get from Ellis Island steak special -- under seasoned and soft.  Baked potato (3/5 stars) - It was a baked potato. Not as good as those found @ Sweet Tomatoes. Furnishings except for sour cream and butter, although I believe there was bacon bits available in the salad bar.  Dessert: Fruit jubilee ice cream  Very good (4.5/5 stars). Vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream, a crispy cookie, I believe strawberry jam at the bottom.  Service: Server was very nice and attentive -- definitely felt the \"Aloha vibe.\"  Overall: solid 4/5 stars. Good balance between quality and cost.  \"Would I Come Back Again?\" Rating: Emphatic YES.  Similar places to try: Prime Rib Special @ Ellis Island Casino Cafe",

    "text": "So the last couple of times we have been to Vegas I have  wanted to come by and try the Ox Tail soup. I am glad I did. After standing in a line about 50 yards deep I was surprised how fast we got to the front and were seated. There are a lot of great items on the menu from Eggs Benedict for under $8, to the Lau Lau, short ribss and much more but I came for one reason and one reason only. I had been told that my Mom has made this for us when I was younger but I honestly dont remember.  The large bowl of broth had plenty of bones with meat coming off the bones. The soup is seasoned very well and I would compare it to a Mexican/Hispanic dish Cocido which uses a different meat but still has a similar taste and texture. If there was one complaint is that a couple of bones had a lot of fat on it but again, I have the same issue on even some of my favorite cocido restaurants. Its going to happen.  My wife tried the Wanton soup but I must explain that she is a very picky eater and does not like vegetables so the bowl of Oriental Soup Combo that the very nice waitress suggested was out of the picture. She ate some of her soup but said it had a strong odor. I tried it and could not pick up any unusual or bad smell.  We also ordered the banana fritters. This was a little deceiving but still very tasty. They give you about 3-4 wanton wrappers with a nut medley inside. It is very good. They also give you a bowl of ice crean and about a half a banana cut into 3/8\" slices. Half is being generous.   The service was fast and they filled our water glasses often. The waitress was very nice and patient with me when I asked her dumb questions like \"do most people put the rice into the broth?\". She suggested not to and I didn't; what do you think.  I would love to come back and try something else but I dont think my wife is going to come with me.",

Walking into Market Street Cafe makes me feel like I am back home in Hawaii.  They also have other local favorties!",

Guest1: (all of sudden in pidgin)  Oh, I like get da oxtail soup den... plus one saimin... en da portugee sausage en eggs to go, yeah?  ... everyone stares, including the waiter.... then laughter... aloha loa!  Its such an oddity to find, but a welcome comfort to know that this place (and the California Hotel) is just a short ride over from the Strip, in case one gets tired of mega-fusion-hybrid cuisine.  The restaurant and amenities themselves are run-of-the-mill Old Downtown Vegas... vinyl, faux-brass, fake dark-lacquered-wood tables, awful carpeting, etcetera etcetera.  But spacious for the most part, and accommodating to bigger groups... we ended up having a party of 8, though I saw a few parties in the restaurant numbering in the dozens.  The service is top notch here!  From the smiling older Japanese auntie who greeted-and-seated us, to the young howsit-brah who served us, to the big-as-a-house but cheery and laid-back Polynesian securing the front... it was very homey and unpretentious...  The food is decent, for diner renditions of generally home-cooked Hawaiian-Asian fare.  The oxtail soup is plentiful with meat, tender from cooking all day long in the fairly flavorful broth.  I personally expected/would have liked a slightly tangier broth.  The Portuguese Sausage and Eggs over rice looked delicious in its simplicity; a breakfast plate that brings me back to my youth.  The saimin came out steaming hot and all I could think about was standing outside on an early early morning in front of a Zippy's shack on Oahu... mmm fishcake!  I'll be going back, for sure...",

On our way out of the California (Saturday 4/12 around 6:15) we stopped by to order and proceeded to run into your host/cashier who not only denied us but was also incredibly rude and untactful. As tourists who chose to dine with you, it's not crazy to expect quality service. I'm a manager at a red robin in Seattle and if I were to ever witness customer service like that from one of my team members, I would fire him/her on the spot. We'll make it a point to never come back again and believe that I'll put the word out to my friends and family to blacklist you. I was born and raised in Hawaii and that is not the Aloha spirit.

    "text": "This is reviews for locals... local to Hawaii that is.  HAWAIIAN SPECIALS Of course the reason you go to the Cal is for the Hawaiian specials and the Oxtail Soup is no exception.  The Oxtail Soup is good.  And if you're around Downtown, it's probably worth stopping in and trying.  -- Is it anything you can't get at home? Hell no.   -- Is it cheap?  Hell yeah. Note:  Oxtail Soup is only available as a late night special so you'll have to wait until 11PM for it.  The line gets a little long so be sure to bring something to do while you wait.  DON'T EXPECT MUCH (i.e. MY LAU LAU STORY) In addition to the oxtail soup, once I decided to push it and get a lau lau.  And naturally the taro & pork were dry & there was no butterfish, so being that I didn't have any poi, this didn't go down easy. ...Nowadays, I usually just get a side of portugeuse sausage & rice.  Why?  Just because.  I think they serve Redondo's but I can't be sure.  It's not sweet so it's not Purity.  CHEAP GRINDS In any case, if you're used to the strip, this is going to be the cheapest meal of the week for you.  2 people can eat for $12 and change.  GOOD BLACKJACK They also have $10 3-2 Double Deck Blackjack here with typical rules (Hit on S17, Double Down any 2 cards, split aces up to 4) which you'll want to stick around to play for a while.  CONCLUSION It's a good place to visit if you're from the islands or your just happen to be downtown around 11PM.  You can hit the tables and eat some local food at the same time.  Not bad.  3-stars.  --------------- ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOTE: Admittedly, every time I go here, I'm checkin' out the crowd for local talent, but alas - no honeys ever show.  I suspect they're all at the Asian clubs like Tao or PURE.  Instead I see nothing but families with 4 kids & women in muumuu's that look like my Auntie.  Oh well... at least there's good soup and good blackjack.",

That is some beefy soup.  Good as is with their two scoops of rice, this is hangover medication in soup form.  I woke up this morning in Flagstaff, Arizona.  Went to Grand Canyon's South Rim, drove by the Hoover Dam, got to Las Vegas and explored Paris and Bellagio, watched a Memorial Day special water fountain light show, and after brisk walking back to our car, ended up at this quaint hotel and casino in downtown Las Vegas.  Got in line for Market Street Cafe, and after what was almost half an hour, got seated.  The ox tail soup was definitely a major highlight of the day.  Cilantro? Minced ginger? Chili paste? Aloha Shoyu? None of that is necessary to add to my ox tail soup.  It totally hit the spot as is.  Market Street Cafe as a whole is basically those 24-hour usual cafes found in any casino.  You would totally overlook this if you didn't take the time and noticed their graveyard specials.  And the best special?  Ox tail soup.  Every Vegas visit from this point on may include a visit for some soup...",

He stay akamai li'dat. Me? I no care what they write about in WEIRD magazine about computer kine stuff. Nevermind dat - this blala stay hungry. I kept asking \"when we going eat, bra?\" So I finally told him I need to eat now bumbai I goin' pass out. So we got to da California Hotel and we saw da kine Aloha Specialties. My friend went suggest that but I said Nah - laters with dat kine place. I like go buffet, bra. I like eat plenty kine. Bigger bang for da buck for dis blala. So we when go da kine Market Street Cafe. They get da kine food you can get in Hawaii, bra. I got lumpia, portagee sausage, and all kine Japanese and Chinese food. They even get manapua but da manapua stay all buss up li'dat. Small kine too. And then I went back for one 'nother plate and dis time got popolo kine food - collared greens, black-eyed peas, and yams. Was good - dis blala was satisfied. Opu filled to da max, I no shit you, bra. Service? Ah - shitty, bra. Da old lady waitress went give my friend stinkeye and went ignore him when he ask for one refill, bra. I no shit you. I was goin' give five stars cuz of da ono local kine food all in one place but because of da service - suffa, bra! I went cockaroach da extra star.",

I get if a party of four order 1-2 oxtail soup and share, I can understand that. But we had four orders of food, and you tack that on without a mention? You bet we had a talk with the supervisor about it to remove that. The supervisor was very rude about it after.  Secondly, the steak and eggs that my boyfriend got was gross. The steak is comparable to golden corral and legit tastes like ass once swallowed. My boyfriend also threw up after eating it.   Third, oxtail soup was good but not so amazing to bring me back here. We went to Orleans the next day as they now served oxtail soup late night as well. The broth at Orleans was much better.  Waited in line for a good 30 minutes before getting seated in this empty restaurant just to be charged for unreasonable fees and eat ass steak. No thanks.",

Then we didn't see her throughout our time eating there. My father had to walk in the kitchen himself and refill his own drink. Smh.

Parking was free for me because the gate operator was gone. I did see signs about validation requirements throughout the parkinglot. The only plus is that they serve oxtail at after-clubbing hours, the downside is that it is served at after-clubbing hours. The oxtail is MEDIOCRE. The broth is too salty and the oxtail itself was a bit dry. If you are Asian or familiar with oxtail soup then you will be disappointed about the oxtail soup here. If there is a line to be seated then it isn't worth it. I arrived at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday and was lucky to be seated right away. If you come after 11:30, you will probably have to wait in line. I would recommend you to just find a pho (Vietnamese soup) restaurant and order oxtail from there.",

And its the perfect remedy to neutralize the alcohol in the tummy. The chili with rice is your basic Zippys mix, and hits the spot. Always ono.  The lines can get super long so come at off times or be patient. And word to the wise, your entire party must be present to be seated.  Good eats!",

We went back the next night to try the oxtail soup we had seen everyone order. If you have ever had a good Mexican beef caldo you have basically tasted this soup. It tasted nearly identical. The ox meat is a little more fatty but good. It was a nice portion for the price so no complaints. Service was awesome the first night and not so great the second night. Our waitress was different the second night and was kinda rude and inattentive. The food was great so it didn't really matter. We will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas.",

Just a warning though, if you're coming by, be prepared to wait.  Depends on what time you come, the wait could be almost 30 minutes to an hour, maybe even longer! My friends and I usually alternate waiting in line.  Let them go and gamble while someone stands and waits.    All in all, it is sooooo worth the wait.  They've got other yummy items on the menu too!  I liked the tocino (filipino bacon) and eggs, and short ribs too!  If you're from Hawaii and have never been, you need to come and give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!  Heck, you might even run into someone you know!  =)",

I've been here in the morning for their breakfast buffet, during lunch time and late at night when they have their oxtail soup. My favorite thing is the breakfast buffet because it's so cheap and you get to eat a little bit of everything. The food here is always delicious at any time of the day and you really can't beat the price. Being in Vegas often means spending a lot of money whether it be on expensive buffets on the strip or on gambling, but this restaurant is the perfect place to get a good meal in for a low price. Sometimes there is a fairly long line to get into the restaurant, but it doesn't take too long. I'll be back for sure!",

The butterfish is so good, with a huge piece, its served only at 4pm to 10pm tho, part of the dinner special. The oxtail soup is awesome too, but only served during graveyard 11 pm to 9 am. I had the won ton min as well, I think the use S&S saimin, but its ok, was still good. The Sirloin and Eggs wasn't as good as I remembered, a litte tough.   Not much has changed during the 20 years I've been coming here, I really like that. My favorites as a kid were the California Ham breakfast and the chicken fingers.   During specials times just be aware that there is a line of Hawaii people waiting to use their Vacations Hawaii coupons. Worth the wait though. It was a treat for my Hawaii family now on the mainland.   My friend from Vegas said he comes to Market Street for late night diner-style food, he said the graveyard special Banana Fritters are bomb.   Always a must for me when in Vegas!",

We had the prime rib special at $9.99!!!Juicy, tender and cooked right. Not as thick as normal prime ribs but it was good enough for me! Came with baked potatoes, squash soup, and cherries jubilee (sooooo goood!!!!).   Oxtail soup was sinfully delicious! So tender the meat falls off the bone and tendon GLORIOUS tendons!!!!!!! Comes in a huge plastic bowl with rice on the side. Available only after 11pm and it costs 9.99  Try the French Toast! It's big, oily and DELICIOUS!! Lol! Dunk it in the pancake syrup! Heaven!   The pancakes was HUGE but not as soft and fluffy as I like it.   Overall, a great find. We came here twice and the old casino atmosphere we got while strolling back to our hotel was priceless.

Their oxtail soup is a great midnight treat, and you can't go wrong with a new york teak that is four dollars.  Mind you have to get it after midnight, but it does indeed satisfy after a night of gambling, drinking, partying, etc.  But for dinner, they have a prime rib special.  You get salad bar, prime rib dinner, and a desert all for $7.99.  I couldn't believe it.    I eat here every time i come to Las Vegas, no matter where i stay.  I love being around locals (people from Hawaii) and enjoying good food.  The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the service isn't wonderful.  Then again it depends, any given day you could get good or bad service.  Some days you may have a very attentive server, and on others you may have you chase them down to get refills on your drink.

I only ordered oxtail soup so I didn't know about other dishes, but they have 1/2 lb steak for only $4.95 so it's probably worthwhile to try.  Beware they only serve the oxtail soup between 11pm - 11am except sunday.   You will have to wait in line for at least 30 minutes to get the soup  Soup come with rice so it's good if you're around 3 AM and super hungry and need a quick fix of warm meal  Too bad they don't have fried onion and sambal to garnish the soup. Tabasco just doesn't cut it.    Soup comes with grated ginger and cilantro on the side. Adding cilantro to the soup makes sense, but adding ginger to the soup is weird IMO.",

I cant believe that he has never heard of this place.  sometimes this is the only reason to make the drive from los angeles to vegas.  it brings back memories of good old filipino home cooking with their ox tail soup served with two scoops of white rice.  the meat on the ox tail basically falls right off and the broth is amazing.  nice big serving with 4 pieces of meat in each of our soups.  we also ordered the $4.00 steak and it tasted like $4.00.  service is pretty quick once you get thru the 30 min wait in line.  the only other bad part about the place is that they only serve the ox tail soup between 11pm and 11am.",

The food is always good, they have excellent service (the staff is friendly & attentive), it's fairly priced, and I feel like I'm back in the islands. Being here makes me less home sick. :)   For some reason I really liked their pancakes, it was light and fluffy. It satisfied my craving for some form of cake. This is a go to spot for me when I'm downtown, eating with family or bringing my Hawai'i family and friends here when they come to visit. It's the lure of the oxtail that keeps me coming back to this place, although I don't always order it.  I've had the Oxtail soup which is pretty large, at least for me. It's a bummer the price went up :(, $9.99. They have to keep their business going somehow right?   There are late night specials and a breakfast buffet which are pretty decent. The Reuben sandwich which is actually pretty good here in my opinion (i really liked it compared to other places). No complaints about food, food is pretty decent. The salad bar is good too, but it sucks that its only available during certain times.",

Not bad at all! Of course not Lawry's status but pretty good. Lastly, the cherry jubilee is such a nice finish to seal the deal. Loved how it comes with a wafer cookie.

You know almost everything tastes good when you're drunk, but it's really good. Service is good. Perfect to end a night of dancing and drinking. ONLY AVAILABLE 11pm-9am.

Well, walk towards main street and walk into CALIFORNIA CASINO, and hit this place up is 24/7 open and is very well known for their oxtail soup (never tried it because a tail with white in it just didn't sound too appetizing).  Here you will find a mix of Denny's type of food fused with Hawaiian elements. Being a European from across the sea, I believe that equals unhealthy food, however; from an American perspective it might sound as ''comfort'' food.  The reason why this place didn't earn its full star is simply because the variety of items they have. Sure, they have all night specials that are screamingly cheap. And that's the only reason why I would come:  ''Have to stay around Fremont St., being up late (past 12AM) and in need of hot food.''  In they day time I would avoid this place at any time since there are greater places to fill your tummy. If you come at night, make sure you have still some patience since  lines can get very busy and the restaurant is very big and always filled, resulting into long wait times and not-so-special service (more like conveyor belt service!), but that's o.k. for the price of a fast food meal.",

I had the Philippine breakfast which consists of Tocino which is pork meat cooked in a sweet sauce for those who don't know, garlic rice (garlic on the side), 3 eggs over easy & some wheat toast with butter already on it. The Tocino meat was tender and melts in your mouth. I like mashing my over easy eggs with my rice. It was so good with the cooked garlic mixed up with my rice. Delicious! I had ice water to drink which saved us money on the total bill. Husband had the all you can eat breakfast buffet. It consisted of your typical breakfast stuff like scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, bananas, muffins, corn beef hash, etc. I didn't care for the buffet. I'd rather have Tocino, rice and my eggs over easy. Yummy!  The restaurant has plenty of room and a few waitresses working the floor. Waitress was nice. There are certain times where service can be slow because it's a Saturday and they can get busy. Weekdays are probably not as busy. This is a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",

The green beans that came with it was bland but who likes green beans anyway?   Anyways, MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES TO THE MARKET STREET CAFE AND ITS EMPLOYEES FOR MY RANT IN MY FIRST REVIEW.

Their main draw seems to be the Ox Tail soup, which is served in the middle of the night. I have not been able to try it because I've come multiple times around 11pm on various days and the line is always looping around and packed. It is only served from 11pm to 7am. I usually get the loco moco (rice, spam, egg, gravy) and Hawaiian Sun guava drink. Definitely as unhealthy as you can get, but works for nursing or preventing a hangover. The food here is not gourmet or even close by any means, but I have yet to get food poisoning. I did get the runs one time from the greasy breakfast buffet. If you're sensitive to oil content I'd recommend avoiding it. Someone also pointed out that this place seems to not serve much fresh produce. The side veggies that come with the specials look like they're from a frozen bag or a can. The fruit in the breakfast buffet are definitely canned. Except for the bananas.   Service is can be slow because they're always busy and most of the people working here are probably from Hawaii. If you've been to Hawaii you'll know what I mean. If it is just you go sit at the counter. You can just walk up there without waiting and other from the person standing back there instead of waiting forever for a table.   Uh, you gamblers can use your dining vouchers here.",

After four refills of water, we still have not seen our server. After finishing off my fifth glass of water, the skies split open and a ray of sunshine beamed into the room as choir of angel's voices sang along with the sound of trumpets fanfaring the arrival of our server. \"Two Oxtail Soups, please.\"  It was about 10 minutes and the food finally arrived. Steaming hot oxtail soup. Three large pieces of meat accompanied with chopped celery and carrot swimming in a delicious broth. A side of cilantro and ginger makes this dish complete. The broth had a great balance of flavor and the meat fell right off the bones. So delicious!  Finally stuffed and about to explode, it took awhile for our server to bring us the check. I think I dozed off a bit, I was so stuffed.  Overall, it was a good experience and at about $10 for the soup,it was a great experience.  Cleanliness : 4/5 Service (waitress) : 4/5 Service (water refills) : 5/5 Food (oxtail soup) : 4/5",

    "text": "A great budget friendly cafe option if you are staying in Downtown Las Vegas. The cafe is located on the ground floor of the California Hotel and Casino. They have some awesome late night specials (be warned that lines can get pretty long if you want to take advantage of these).  We came for breakfast two separate days and once for the late night special. For the first breakfast, I got the ox tail stew, which tasted like beef stew with three big pieces of ox tail and a side of rice. It was very tasty and at $9.99, quite the steal. The second time, we came and got the $6.99 breakfast buffet, which was decent, but nothing to write home about. Main items include scrambled eggs, sausage, ham, hash browns, and some fruit. For the late night, we got the ox tail soup (more of an asian style beef soup with ginger and cilantro and rice on the side), NY Steak with two sides ($6.99). All were very good and quite the bargain. The cafe is open 24/7 and you pay on the way out. Overall, a great budget friendly 24 hour cafe in Downtown Las Vegas.",

As I ordered, the cook told me that the wait might be 20 mins as he had to take care of a large order before mines; I was fine with it as I had some time to kill.  As I waited, a seriously line of old Asian ladies came in behind me. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to stay in my spot in line or move forward and pay. After it seemed like the large order prior to mines was done, the cook looked at me and I said, \"do I stay here and wait for my order or move forward and pay?\" He said, \"oh, you didn't move up in line?\" I said, \"no because I wasn't sure...it was my first time here...\"  He motioned me towards the cashier and asked if I wanted a drink. I said, \"yes, a pepsi!\"  He came to the front with my bento and pepsi in hand. I asked him how much it was and it said it was \"on the house!\"  WOW!!!! That was really nice of him. I gave him whatever tip/dollar bills I had.   Other than the service, my bento was ONO. Chicken katsu and spam :) the teri beef was more like teriyaki steak...not the kind of thinly sliced teri beef I'm used to, to which I normally don't care for anyways. And in this bento, their teri beef was my favorite part of the dish.   I wanna try their Saimin next!",

My last review for the oxtail soup at Market Street Cafe was in 2011, and I still feel the same about it now as I did back then.  The oxtail soup is part of their \"Graveyard Specials\", only available from 11pm - 9am.  Worth it.  4-5 pieces of oxtail, with meat that just melts off the bone.  But I've said this all already.  Nothing has changed, but that's what makes it great.  If you ask me what I want late at night in Vegas, oxtail soup might just be my answer.",

I don't have the time to make it up to Downtown Vegas from the strip, but this time, I was with family during our roadtrip and we decided to stop by this restaurant for dinner. My brother and dad had already gone, so I knew it was a really affordable restaurant. I had pretty low expectations, but after waiting in line for 20 minutes on a weekday, we finally got seated. It thankfully didn't smell like cigarettes and the restaurant was super cute and had a retro classy hotel feel to it.   The value of the food here was amazing! There were a lot of different choices for $10 meals, but the majority of us picked the $10 prime rib special where you get the unlimited salad bar, potato side (mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, french fries), vegetables, prime rib, and dessert! My boyfriend ordered their $10 country fried chicken steak with mashed potatoes and a corn with the salad bar (no dessert). First of all, the salad bar was so delicious! It was almost like Souplantation, but actually better! Their macaroni salad and imitation crab salad was very Hawaiian and delicious. They even had a broccoli dish where it literally tasted like the Joan's broccoli at Souplantation. I definitely had my full at the salad bar, but then the actual main course came.   The prime rib with juice and green beans were absolutely amazing. The medium rare was perfect for me and the green beans were definitely buttered up or something because I couldn't stop eating them. Then the dessert came, which was just a vanilla ice cream with cherries syrup and a little waffle cone chip. Overall, this was a great bang for your buck restaurant with a great ambiance!",

    "text": "There are few left but Market Street Cafe at the California Hotel in DTLV is one of the value coffee shops still left.  I met a good friend from Toronto and he chose this place because the buffet to which we had planned to go at the Fremont was closed for renovation.  They still have a $9.99 prime rib special and that's what we both ordered.  It comes with soup or salad bar, baked, mashed, fries or other options for starch, and cherries jubilee for dessert.  I asked for the rarest piece of prime rib they had and I was off to the salad bar.  My friend got the soup of the day, a corn chowder.  The meals came quickly and my prime rib was a nice reddish pink color.  We both ordered baked potatoes and Sandra--our very 'Aloha' server--brought small containers of butter, sour cream, and horseradish before the dinners were ready.  This is not prime rib from some fancy, high priced restaurant.  It's a basic slice of prime rib, thin, but it had good flavor and it's quite a bargain for what you get.  The baked potato could have used a bit more cooking but it was otherwise OK.  The dessert, cherries jubilee, is simply a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of some cherries in a sweet sauce.  While not the real thing, it was an enjoyable ending to the meal.  Since my friend uses insulin and can't have the ice cream, I fell on my sword and had both.  With Boyd owning this casino and picking up other properties around the valley, I'll go farther afield with my dining offers than just the Suncoast.  I enjoyed my dinner here.  Our server, Sandra, was a gem!  What a great attitude and very friendly and welcoming!  There should be more like her.  Aloha!",

    "text": "I had Market Street Cafe's graveyard specials bookmarked for quite some time, and now that I am on a night float rotation this month, I decided to check it out during my weekend off time.   Market Street Cafe is located inside the California Hotel & Casino in downtown Las Vegas. There is an attached parking garage and I think you can get parking validation by dining at Market Street Cafe, but I found a street parking spot closer to the hotel entrance. Street parking is free after 10PM, though no street parking allowed between 3-5AM or so due to street cleaning.  The graveyard specials are available from 11PM-9AM (or was it 7AM?). I came to try the famous oxtail soup that is ONLY available during this time. It's clearly a very popular dish at night, as I saw several other customers order it, and they have a bunch of spoons and ginger/cilantro sides prepared for this dish.  Before getting to the food, there was a considerable line out the entrance when I arrived around midnight. The line moves quickly, though they seat based on availability, so a lot of smaller groups got seated before larger groups. Since I was dining alone, when the hostess came through the line to take down party sizes, she recommended that I sit at the counter. I was therefore extremely lucky and bypassed the entire line and got seated at the counter immediately. =)  The full menu is available at the bar/counter. Service was mediocre, but there were two servers and my water got refilled. The interior is basic but clean, very much like your typical diner.  I ordered the oxtail soup (comes with a serving of white rice), as well as banana fritters, both off of the graveyard specials menu. The oxtail soup was very tasty (though a little salty at the end when drinking the final bits of broth), and came with a generous amount of oxtail. The bowl is quite large, and with the side of rice, it is definitely a filling meal. My waitress actually forgot about my banana fritters and gave me a check with just oxtail soup, so I had to remind her about the fritters. The fritters ended up not being all that special, and I would argue that they are not a necessary order. The dish here was basically crushed nut-filled fried wontons served with sliced bananas, caramel sauce, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with whipped cream. While the banana fritters were tasty enough, it wasn't really what I was expecting after Googling banana fritters.   Overall, I think the regular Hawaiian food menu is probably great all day, though the graveyard specials are nice too. I have made better oxtail soup myself in a slow cooker, but the oxtail soup at Market Street Cafe is not bad at all for $10.99 + tax.",

As soon as we were seated, we were greeted by several friendly servers providing the nightly special.  Each of us had ordered the famous ox tail soups.  Portion size was generous filled with three large pieces of ox tail bone in and several loose pieces of meat, scattered carrots, celeries, and mushrooms. The ox tail is super tender, it falls off the bone, does not need to wrestle with them.  Soup base is okay, adding the minced gingers and cilantro were whimsical, but it is not as scrumptious as the main attraction.  But it is worth the wait.  Most diners ordered the famous ox tail soups. Just hope there are enough for those still waiting when we left.",

We've had times where we had spectacular service for big groups that we've showed up with drunk and loud. I'm sure the servers are used to it but I'm always the apologetic one that over tips when we are too excited and loud.

Three words: PRIME RIB SPECIAL  This prime rib dinner special is $9.99, which is ridiculously cheap for the amount of delicious food you get. It comes with an 8 oz cut (pretty good portion) of prime rib, container of au jus sauce (OBSESSED with this), soup of the day or salad bar, green beans, a side (french fries/rice/mashed potato/baked potato/etc), and cherries jubilee ice cream. Phew that was a mouthful.   The prime rib can be a hit or miss in terms of dryness. Most of the time it's good. I always, always cover my prime rib with all of the au jus sauce to let it soak (yes I know it's so bad for you, but it's so good). This deal ends at 10 PM I believe so it's not one of those midnight specials.  The service is always average to good. The bussers are always very accommodating. When I go to places for a super cheap dinner special, I don't expect exemplary service anyways. This place has Hawaiian vibes to it which is cool. I've tried the club sandwich and oxtail soup here also. Both are very good. I would love to try their loco moco, but that desire gets overpowered by the prime rib. You have to grab a ticket when you go into the parking garage. If you hand the ticket to the restaurant's cashier while paying for the food they will validate it (thus free parking). I always make it a point to bring my out of town friends/family here. This place really is a gem in the California Hotel (downtown Las Vegas).",

Once in awhile I can see how the kitchen can overestimate how much is left but lately it seems like they'll bring you whatever they feel like and make excuses like they over cooked it and it couldn't be helped. This is a daily special. Don't you guys have this down yet? Overcooked prime rib is pretty unappetizing.   I highly recommend the oxtail stew special and the short rib special as well. The breakfast buffet is also a good deal if you're satisfied with Portuguese sausage, scrambled eggs, & hash browns. No Michelin 4 star buffet to be found here. Working class diners should be okay with it.",

IT GETS CRAZY! So I understand you have to be more patient. And as I mentioned above, food isn't consistent.. they're good with having it returned and making a new one!   As long as the food tastes good, I'm happy!  The hype about their oxtail soup is real! I also tried the oxtail stew, it's actually pretty bomb!  I think I've already tried like everything on their menu. Lol   + The Hawaiian special could get a little help on the chicken long rice! I'm from Hawaii.. idk why I expected it to be the same.   I've been here so much that I feel like some of the workers are family. There was one who definitely stood out and my family liked him so much, I wish I remembered the guy's name, he was cracking up some jokes with us and lightening up the mood when he realized we were waiting quite a bit to get our orders taken. The decor and ambiance definitely makes you feel like you're as old as your parents haha but I didn't find it to bother me anyway.",

    "text": "So my boyfriend and I stayed at the California Hotel recently and everyone we talked to recommended this place. They said we should try the Oxtail Soup ($9.99) and the Prime Rib Special ($9.99).  We came here twice and our first time coming here was absolutely horrible. When we first sit down, our server doesn't even come to our table for 15 mins. Then he finally comes to us and asks what we would like. I was really drunk so I wanted Chicken Fingers which comes with either soup or the salad bar and french fries. I requested soup and then that was the last time we saw our server. He never brought out the soup, never checked on us, and didn't even bring us drinks. Another server ended up taking over for him because she felt bad for us. However, the soup and the chicken fingers were got good at all. Soggy tenders and soup that tasted like it had been sitting out for quite some time. Gross! (1 star experience)  Then our friends came with us a couple days later to get the Prime Rib Special and this experience was COMPLETELY different. Our servers (ya we had multiple servers) taking care of us. It was great! They continuously refilled our water, was very attentive, and brought our food out super quick. The Prime Rib Special comes with your choice of potatoes (mashed, baked, fries), soup/salad, and a dessert of Cherry Jubilee. The Prime Rib was actually pretty good, especially for 9.99. Also the salad bar wasn't bad either, pretty basic, but nothing awful about it. Don't go too wild on the salad bar though because this special comes with a lot of food. Lastly, I don't actually like the taste of cherries, but when they gave us the Cherries Jubilee dessert, it was really tasty and I really liked it. (5 star experience)  I wish I could give this a better review, but that first experience was truly horrible. Overall, I will definitely be back and I will try and get the Oxtail Soup that is only between 11 pm - 9 am.",

I've eaten the club sandwich here and there hey don't toast the bread. They could make the food taste better but I think they just use low quality food. Portuguese sausage is junk and don't even bother with their eggs.",

From a $9.99 prime rib special to a late night oxtail soup that's a great way to finish off a power day of Vegas indulgence. Food isn't amazing but it's solid nourishment fairly priced.  They also have a bargain breakfast every morning from 6:00 - 11:00. Standard items include linguica, bacon, ham, sausage, corned beef hash, fresh ruit, scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuits and gravy. Again nothing amazing but all these options prepared well enough with a bottomless cup of coffee for $6.25 is a solid bargain way to recharge before hitting head on all that is Vegas.",

Never had a problem with service since I've been coming here from '99, some people are more personable than others, so what?  Pro Tip, after the Cinderella start time of this Oxtail Heaven, they stop serving at 9 am. (Yes, I absolutely DID rush here at 6 am to upload max oxtail into my gaping maw. I am not a Vegas rook)",

Like most yelpers have said, the portion sizes are huge! So you will definitely get a lot of bang for your buck. However, they lack the service and the American food was mediocre. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and sadly, the mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best. Throughout the whole service, we never had a waitress come back and check on us and there were hardly any in sight. We didn't have any of our waters refilled throughout the whole meal. All in all, this place is an okay restaurant to go to if you're in the area but nothing worth making a trip to since it is further off the strip away from all the other main atractions.",

    "text": "Hope that Chris J. responds to this review.  He seems to only acknowledge positive reviews and ignores those with some kind of criticism in them -- My issue is the same as its always been for decades!! (No kidding)  My oxtail soup comes to me lukewarm in 90% of the time.  Granted, I am one of those weirdos who likes my soup bubbling hot when it is served to me, but c'mon, I am not kidding when I say that my oxtail soup is almost always lukewarm.  It was that way again yesterday morning.  I asked my waitress about this and she was kind enough to spend a minute discussing this issue with me.  She told me what I already knew -- they use a lot of oxtail each day.  So they boil/cook them in advance and leave them in a pan outside of the soup.  Sometimes depending upon how much oxtail is cooked, it is placed in the fridge; sometimes not.  Their standard is to keep the soup liquid at 180 degrees F.  Then when an order comes in, the oxtails goes into a bowl and the soup is poured over them.  Here is where the problem lies.  Room temperature oxtails, and worst yet if they have been refrigerated, will immediately bring the entire dish down to a lukewarm temperature when it is served to a guest.  If they really care about customer service and the quality of their food, they will raise the soup liquid standard to at least 200 degrees F.  At home, when I make oxtail soup or saimin or wun tun mein, my soup liquid is actually boiling at 212 degrees as I serve it and pour it into the bowls.  If they do this, then perhaps I will not be getting lukewarm oxtail soup in 90% of the time I order it.",

Food wasn't better either which just made the experience more disappointing. My daughters fries weren't even lukewarm, it was cold. It was definitely mind boggling. Hamburger steak and Teriyaki chicken was generic but at least it was moist. My Korean ribs tasted a little too sweet and gristly. The only redeeming dish was the Zippys chili, probably the one reason I would ever return.   Price point was also higher compared to their counterparts.

If you're visiting Vegas and craving a little 'Hawaiian style' food, Market Street Cafe has what you need and for a reasonable price.  While there this past visit I had the Oriental Combo Soup.  It comes with wonton, spinach, fish cake, saimin noodles, char Sui, green onions and shrimp.  It was delicious!    The second time I at there this last visit I had the Kalua Pig & Cabbage.  It comes with rice and macaroni salad.  Ohhhh so good!  Both visits were exceptional, food was so good and the atmosphere was casual and quiet.    The servers rarely have expression and usually seem angry, but this has always been the case, for as long as I have been going to Vegas.  Years.    I highly recommend this restaurant (which is open 24 hours) to anyone visiting downtown Las Vegas and craving a little taste of Hawaii.",

It was ok, the broth was like regular beef soup but the oxtail tasted good. That was until I found a black hair on one of the bones. After that I wasn't able to finish my meal.  They took the soup off the bill. They should have taken the the coffees and chicken tenders my friend ordered off as well. I came here once before. After this experience it will be my last as well.",

Next the waitress who delivered our drinks showed so much enthusiasm....luckily the waiter who took our order and delivered the food was pleasant. If it wasn't for him this review would've had no stars....hope ...you take your reviews seriously and give more training on customer service and what the aloha spirit means.",

She had to do one person at a time and couldn't balance the total. She was really rude the first time we encountered her, and really needs to improve on her customer service skills. Felt like she made it a personal vendetta to make our visit intolerable each time we went back. Good thing is there's a lot more places to eat in Las Vegas!",

We went around 5am after a long night of gambling and there was no line. It was super empty... I'm sure the rest of the world were soundly asleep in bed.   Ordered an oxtail soup and they didn't charge us a sharing fee.... I thought there was one but it was totally worth the $10 bucks it costs. The oxtail soup pieces were huge and super tender, came right off the bone. The broth was flavorful... I would have liked to see more veggies in there, but I think the star was the oxtail anyway. The only other complaint was the soup wasn't piping hot; it was more lukewarm, but that was fine. I was exhausted and the soup hit the spot.   Delicious. I'll come back for sure!",

I've been coming here for years now and I've always had a good meal here.   ===Service===  The service here can be lacking sometimes, but for the most part it's pretty good. All the staff is friendly, but sometimes they forget about your table and you have to kind of flag them down. The food always comes out pretty quick so if they seem like they are taking a while you should check on your order.   ===Food===  Oxtail soup: By far the best oxtail soup that I've had. The broth is delicious here! I definitely recommend getting this here.  Steak & eggs: Surprisingly a very tender piece of meat with 2 eggs, toast and your choice of rice or hash browns. The steak was around 6 oz. so it's a little on the smaller side, but it was very good.   Prime rib dinner: The prime rib was pretty good for the price. You definitely can't complain when it comes to this entree.   AYCE salad bar: Your typical salad bar with all the toppings. Make sure you wear some loose pants!   I highly recommend eating here if you get hungry and need a snack break in between gambling. It's delicious! Enjoy!",

Served only from 11pm to 6am, the soup is just the perfect way to end a long night of partying in Vegas. It's a simple beef broth cooked with tender oxtail, carrots, celery, and peanuts. What makes this dish superb?? Cilantro, ginger bits, and Kikkoman soy sauce. Eat your meat and soup as you would with rice but add the seasonings on top of it. Ooh la la! It makes all the difference! It is served with two small cups of rice on the side but the bowl of soup itself is huge and can be shared by two people. Imagine what great value this was years ago when they were serving it for $5! Now it costs $10..hey, blame it on the economy! Nonetheless, it's still a pretty good deal.   Oxtail soup is not the only good thing here. They have quite an extensive menu of breakfast options that are of great value, too.   SERVICE: We already know most of the servers here by face and they are always prompt and quick despite the unholy hours to be working. There can be a line to get a table but don't fret, it moves pretty quickly.   Until our next Vegas trip...Mahalo!",

    "text": "I made a lot of mistakes in Vegas. I'd say my number 2 mistake was NOT getting to Market Street Cafe at the right time (11APM - 9AM?) to try their oxtail soup!  My party and I rolled in hungover and hungry around 9AM. By that time, the last call for ox tail soup had already been heralded and so we were SOL.  I ended up  ordering the Combination Siamin: The saimin was good. The broth wasn't too salty, there were a lot of goodies in it including kamaboko, char-siu, spinach, and some other stuff I can't remember. I couldn't finish the broth but I just about finished all the noodles. The waitress was nice enough to bring me some chili (sambal) sauce so I could make it spicy to my liking.   My bf and his friends ordered the breakfast buffet, which was a deal at $6.25 and the buffet included: corned beef hash (the canned variety), bacon, biscuits and gravy (good!), eggs, sausage, french toast, and a good assortment of other breakfast items including fresh fruit.  This is a great place if you are looking to spend under $10 for breakfast buffet, OR, if you are really drunk in the middle of the night and just need some soup (which is always the case with me!). I realized this is the best place to eat anytime in DTLV for cheap since they are open 24/7.",

Regardless, my bro was raving about this place months before our trip to Vegas.  So I had to try it.  Needless to say, it was yummy and phenomenal!  Oxtail is very fatty and gelatinous so if you can't handle that then this soup isn't for you. Oxtails have strong muscle fibers thus the meat itself, when slow cooked for a period of time comes out perfectly tender.  The broth is what really kicked it into gear for me.  Very beefy at least 10x more then regular beef stew I would say.  With some salt, pepper, and mixed vegetables this bowl of scrumptious soup was out of this world - well at least you can get it at one place!    The place itself is inside the California Hotel off Fremont.  Very dingy and old hotel with coin slot machines; for the kids, coin slot machines predated paper money or voucher slots.  You can even stick them into what we call \"Pay Phones\" and make calls!  Who knew!  You get the point.  This place isn't full of bang and glam, but for a quick cheap play and some good ass Oxtail soup, it's worth the travel off the main strip - Enjoy!",

I highly recommend the mushroom burger with two cheeses and grilled onions using a turkey burger. Also, don't forget the island teriyaki sauce. It is amazing!!! And for the side, get the mashed potatoes and gravy. Their gravy is bomb! Put it in your sandwich as well. Delicious! I ate it without the top bun to make it lighter as well. I judged it when I was waiting in line.... not being paid attention to as much after they took our numbers like other places. I also judged it a little bit before coming in. I thought t was just plain American food or some other Denny's. Fortunately, it far exceeded my expectations!! My other fam members got the oxtail soup and the New York steak. They definitely enjoyed it. The miso soup tastes like Lucky Me, as well. It's a Filipino type place. Delicious, nonetheless! 5 stars all the way!",

The furniture is covered in food and sticky no matter where you sit. The food is either tasteless or tastes off. My grandpa ordered a butterfish entree and it had a layer of mayonnaise that had solidified because it came cold. The butterfish years ago was much better quality. I visited this place last year and the fish was off tasting too but, that time it tasted like garlic and was spicy. It's supposed to taste like miso not all the flavors mentioned above. Our waiter was inattentive as well and not very friendly. He only took the orders of the males side of the table. When my mom's saimin came to the table, we each tried the broth. It was bland and similar to packaged versions. My brothers loco moco tasted like curry instead of gravy and my sandwich was covered in grease. I hope we never return here ever again. It was a bad experience.",

Served with a large sccop of rice, side of ginger and onions.  For $7.95 it's not tOOoo bad, but cost vs. quality i would have to give it a 2 star rating.  The breakfast buffet is quite cheap- for around 6 dollars you have quite a selection of meats (portugese sausage, bacon, ham, corned beef hash) carbs (crepe things, toast, waffles, danishes, hash browns) and fresh fruits and juice and such.",

After a drunken night in Vegas my friend and I decided to check out MSC.  \"12th st. and Ogden\" is where the navi directed us and our cab driver who spoke very little English dropped us off on Main and Ogden.. he would not take us any further down what he described as \"no no homeless drugs and criminal - danger!\" After several failed attempts at finding help.. a janitor offers to give us a lift on his flatbed.  The  dropped us off on 6th and Ogden and having grown up in LA, we figured we'll just walk 6 blocks in the ghetto - no big deal.  chain fences, 7th st.,  guard dogs, 8th st.,crack houses, 9th st., blinking street lamps.. 10th st., darkness.. okay maybe our cab driver was right but we are so close.  \"AY you two come here!\"  we turn around and a homeless drug-addled, crazy man is running towards us. We run towards 12th street and there's nothing there!.. we loop around in an attempt to lose him and dart towards a lone security guard sitting on a bench.  Well anyways around 6:00 AM we somehow make it to the Market Place Cafe inside the California hotel located on the corner of Main and Ogden.  It was a fun adventure, the food could've been a little better but the price is right and the atmosphere is warm and comforting especially in this lonely city of sin.",

The soup was very flavorful especially when you use the side of ginger that's provided. The Ox tail meat was tender and basically falling off the bone. The steak was ok, it could have had more flavor but i just put some Hawaiian soy sauce on it and it was all good! All in all a good meal and at what other restaurant can you get a bowl of ox tail soup and a new york steak with potatoes and green beans for 11$?",

I stood in front of the empty buffet tray desperately awaiting someone to acknowledge this catastrophic mix up.  I stood in front of the empty tray for nearly 15 minutes refusing to start eating my hawaiian breakfast (which was getting cold in my hand) without hash and these portuguese sausages.  To my horror, they brought out enough hash only to feed a family of ethiopian midgets and portuguese sausages most hated cousin, kielbasa.  I sure didn't drive 250 miles for kielbasa.  This is a break up, Market Street Cafe.  You and me are through.",

    "text": "Located in the Cal, this place looks crowded and has a lot of Asian clientele because the Cal does attract a lot of Asian customers.  The food is really bad.  I can't understand why there is a long line to eat here.  They do give out $7 coupons in the hotel and casino and I think that's the reason this place is so crowded. People will eat horrible food for free or for a few bucks.  I didn't have a coupon.  I tried the salad bar and the saimin.  The one item in the salad bar that I was expecting to be good was the mac salad and it was horrible.  No flavor whatsoever.  It was bland.  It needed some salt and some egg.  The mayo didn't even have an egg flavor like Best Foods mayo.  The saimin was advertised to have char sui and fish cake.  It was 3 paper thin sliced of komobuko and 3 small nuggets of char sui.  My mom had the mahi mahi that was battered in egg and fried.  The batter came really dry. I looked like egg foo yung but the egg was way over cooked.  My sister had the prime rib and she asked for it medium instead of the typical medium rare that the roast is cooked.  The meat had a grayish tint to it like they put the steak in a microwave to get it to medium from medium rare.  The meat was tough.  Just a poor cut of meat.  We ended up going to the Aloha Specialties upstairs to get something decent to eat.  Don't go to this cafe.",

As far as Hawaiian specialties, there weren't that many.  Instead, there were lots of traditional American dishes, which were good.  Just not exactly what I was looking for.  I got the hamburger steak patty with gravy, thinking it was more like a loco moco, but it was pretty much a salisbury steak.  I chose rice, and it was all pretty good.  However, the green beans I could've done without.    The kiddo got the braised short ribs, and again, good, not great.  Could've been cooked a bit longer because they were a tad tough.  The hubby got the chicken fried steak, and it was, as you guessed it,  good.  I'd think it would be pretty hard to mess up chicken fried steak.  Service was efficient and friendly.  It was like my Lola was serving me dinner.  I actually felt pretty bad for asking for refills.  I had the urge to get up and get my own Pepsi, like a good grand daughter does for her grandma.  She was sweet.    3 decent dinners for around $30.  I'll take it.",

This was seriously the most unprofessional demeanor a supervisor has ever bestowed. She started talking amongst herself and getting crazy. Anyway, if you ever bump into this lady, beware... The security was even mentioning to us that she always calls security on any little incident. They too were mentioning that she was crazy and a waste of time when security is called.  Other than that, the oxtail soup is normally delicious. But because we received improper service and rude attitude from Nancy, we will not return again.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times in the past, but never cared for it. Even for the \"Hawaiian\" fare, it was all just a shrug. I know everyone raves about their Oxtail Soup, but I haven't had it. It's not one of my favorite dishes (even when my mom makes it). Anyway, I have visited twice recently because my brother has been receiving dining comps and I rarely say \"no\" to a free meal.  During my first re-visit, our sister joined us and we ordered various breakfast and dinner options. I had a hankering for Corned Beef Hash (the non-homemade type), so I ordered it with eggs. Canned corned beef hash is so wrongfully tasty. I seriously don't understand my taste for it (or Spam), but I know that other people who grew up in Hawaii understand. Anyway, it's nothing spectacular and it's unfortunately salty, so it needs rice (which sucks since it already has starch from the potatoes!). My sister ordered a Loco Moco, another popular dish in Hawaii made of rice, hamburger patty, eggs, and brown gravy. I don't eat this dish often, but it's still enjoyable when it's made well. This particular one wasn't very good, mostly due to the substandard gravy. We all chose the AYCE salad bar as well since it was so inexpensive ($5.95). It's not expansive, but completely worth it.  The second time, my brother and I decided to try their Breakfast Buffet for $6.25/person (6AM - 11AM). SIX DOLLARS AND TWENTY-FIVE CENTS!!! That is insanely cheap. Completely ridiculous and awesome. They offer scrambled eggs, rice, Portuguese sausage, bacon, grilled ham, biscuits with sausage gravy, corned beef hash, hash browns, French toast, various canned fruits, and a few other items. One plate of rice, eggs, and just five pieces of Portuguese sausage would cost you more than $6.25 at another restaurant. It's a crazy deal. Oh, and you also get free juice with your buffet. A can of Hawaiian Sun juice? YES PLEASE! I also took home an order of Zippy's chili and rice which was cool that they have it. I used to love Zippy's chili, but it's not something I crave anymore.  Okay, so the food isn't top notch and I thought I was going to have a heart attack just by looking at the breakfast buffet (seriously though, the red heat lamps are slightly blinding) - where are the vegetables?! But for the value, my goodness, it is worth just the few good things they offer! Just beware the hash brown...it was disgustingly dry and tasteless. Oh, and it's really difficult to screw up bacon, so you're safe there!  For a really inexpensive \"Hawaii Eats\" meal for any hour of the day, this is worth visiting. Just leave your expectations at the door and trust me, you'll have a good time.",

I mean the servers wear Aloha shirts haha  Great cafe to come to especially late at night after you bar hop downtown. Salad Bar has a lot of nom noms to enjoy, more than your typical Sizzler salad bar... You can add it to your meal or enjoy it solo. The butterfish is sweet and melts in your mouth and comes with some greens and steamed rice. The oxtail soup is delicious and comes out SUPER fast. A big bowl with about 3 big ox tail pieces + some veggies, steamed rice, grated ginger & cilantro is less than $10! The oxtail pieces have tender fall off the bone meat and not too much fat! The soup compliments the ox tail well and is not greasy~  Service is ok.. sometimes we get a friendly server and sometimes not so much. Last time we went BF ordered fries on the side but they never made an appearance... it's ok though because we were beyond stuffed!   The line to get in can sometimes be as long as the club lines (not if you are an Emerald card holder) but it moves at a decent pace and you get to see a bunch of interesting folks. When you are done you pay at the cashier up front!  HOT TIP: brown rice is available",

    "text": "It's about one star for service, five stars for food. So I guess that puts it right in the middle at a solid three.   The Market Street Cafe welcomes you in \"Denny's style\" dining where a hostess seats you on vinyl or you can belly up to the counter. You pay at the cashier on your way out.   Late-night dining alone, I chose the counter and took advantage of their after hours menu (which is heavily discounted). I don't remember specific prices just that they were very low.   I'd always heard about the Hawaiian specialty, Oxtail soup. So I ordered a bowl of that and sat back to see what might come to me. I had visions of a HUGE ox head impaled on porcelain in the middle of my bowl. Perhaps still moving, even looking at me.   \"Where you from?\" Ollie the Ox would ask.   \"Ummmm...Co-Co-Colorado,\" I would answer nervously, looking around to see if anyone noticed me talking to an ox in the bowl.   \"Hmpf,\" he'd reply in a huff. \"Must be nice. I'm from Hawaii but they BUTCHERED me and send me to YOUR FREAKIN' BOWL! All for $5.99! You have penny???\"  At that, the ox would lunge across the counter at my throat, and...  Okay so that didn't happen (see photo). Out came a harmless, sizable bowl of stew complete with tasty ox, vegetables, and other spices. It was very good and I'll be back to order another. It comes with a side of rice and fresh ginger, all in all a whole meal - not just a soup.    It took a while to get my check so I could pay. Meanwhile, another guy got tired of sitting there waiting to order so he left in disgust. Only when I stood up as if I was going to leave did someone come over and present the check to me.   Okay so what did I expect for a few bucks? Ruths Chris servers? No big deal really. Just be prepared.  It's all good and I recommend giving it a shot if you're ever near the California Hotel & Casino.   Just watch out for that ox.",

You are probably here either drunk off your ass from gambling, or  you and your love ones are staying here (or Main Street or Fremont, or  whatever Boyd properties that's near by), or  you are short of time and you justify coming here, or your aging parents are too old and they can't walk more than a block, or you have those tourist coupons, or all of your friends can't decide where to go and you end up here.  Please tell me I'm right? It seems over the years that's always the reasons why I'm here at this place. No, I'm not saying don't come here, I'm just saying the food here has been great , has been average, and has also been awful in different times I've been here.   Most recently, we came here for the breakfast buffet because it was the fastest thing on the menu because you can just line up and eat right away. But the item I love (Portuguese sausage) was so bad that I couldn't even take a bite. I mean, how you can fuck up an oily sausage? That's like saying I overcooked chicken thighs.  It was just dry like dust.   Don't worry I have good memories of this place as well. This review is not all bad, hence the 3 stars. Coming here and be able to sit with all of 12 of your friends at 2am talking about nothing , like an episode out of Seinfield, is pretty priceless here. And being able to do it over the Oxtail soup (which was okay) or my usual club sandwich has great memories that money can't buy.   Oh Market Street Cafe, you really need an overhaul of your menu. Keeping some of the favorite local grinds and maybe just focus on a smaller menu to make it more tasty. While you're at it, please change your seating arrangement. There's always a time and date where people are backing out and hitting other people / waitresses here.   On a final note, no matter what I say or do I know nothing will be changed and I most likely will still be coming here.   Note: The food taste better here at 2am than 7am. Not sure if it was due to drinking.",

The oxtail soup is only served between 11 PM and 9 AM so there are always drunkards roaming around. Go earlier to beat the drunken clubbing crowd. On our most recent visit, some drunk lady was raving about how awesome her Otterbox phone case was and then chucked her phone at the glass display case in the front. The place briefly went silent as everybody looked in shock and wondered if that really just happened. That was too hilarious and I'm glad the phone didn't shatter the glass.  I always get friendly service here.  Minus one star because: THEY DO NOT HAVE SRIRACHA HERE!! I repeat.. NO SRIRACHA!! That is all.",

I really loved the broth and eating that with just rice.    Keep in mind I was inebriated while dining here so maybe this review isn't so accurate...or is it?",

    "text": "This little place, located inside the California Hotel in Fremont, is known for exactly one thing: oxtail soup. This is the reason you see long lines forming right before 11 PM. You will always see a line, and there's a reason why.  As you get seated down in this packed restaurant, you can see everyone eating out of a bowl, sopping up spoonfuls of broth. The melody of slurps swells in the air and it's almost unanimous what should be eaten here.  The oxtail soup is a savory dish with a rich broth and meaty chunks of oxtail. It has flavors of both savory and sweet inside the fatty meat.   For those who never had oxtail before, don't be afraid of this dish. Think of it like eating some delicious, tender beef shanks. The bone-in flavor seeps into the meat, making the broth and meat that more delicious. It's something you have to try.  They also have other delicious items that go for very cheap after the 11 PM hours of the night: the chicken strips & fries, New York Steak, Won Ton Min. Okay, so they aren't the best you can eat, but they are still good, and with being able to buy all three of those dishes up top and not top $15, that's pretty damn good.  The place is a good bargain for late night eats if you're out late gambling or drinking. Of course, the oxtail soup is the way to go, but with prices so low, you're free to explore other dishes at cheap prices. Just remember to always have the dishes hot.",

Since the Cal is my casino of choice when staying in downtown, it is super convenient for me since it is located on the bottom floor, right near the west tower elevators.    The food is pretty good.  They have a prime rib special which comes with soup or salad bar, vegetables, starch (I always go with rice), a cherries jubilee dessert and of course, prime rib.   They have also have a breakfast buffet that runs until about 11am.   Some selections include eggs, rice, Portuguese sausage, French toast strips, bacon, and biscuits.  I think there are a few more items but I can't recall it at the moment.   I would be  remiss to not mention their oxtail soup which is what they are famous for.

    "text": "Oxtail Soup! Our friend had been hyping this place up for weeks leading up to our visit so I was expecting something out of this world. It did not disappoint. We trekked it over to the downtown Fremont St area in the middle of the night after a good night of clubbing. This place is located in the California Hotel. We kinda didn't know what this place was called. We just asked a worker about where to find the oxtail soup and he pointed us to this direction. 3:30 in the morning and still a line - we waited about half an hour to get seated. There were plenty of empty tables though - I think they were trying to stagger the parties to alleviate the service and kitchen from getting overwhelmed. But yeah it still bugs me to see that they had the capacity to be able to seat us much faster. I learned that this area and this restaurant too tend to cater to the Hawaiian crowd. From the decor to all the restaurant and shops, it's like their home away from home.  Even the menu at this restaurant had a bunch of Hawaiian dishes. So yeah, we ordered a whole round of oxtail soup for the table. Some people shared and they were smart. So much meat! It's 4 pieces of giant oxtail and fat in a broth with a few veggies, a side of cilantro and ginger and a bowl of rice too. So good and worth the wait, I suppose. The meat is a bit fatty but super big and meaty and fall-off-the-bone delicious. The broth is surprisingly not too oily which is good to slurp up without guilt. And the rice helps with a different texture. Noodles would've been super delicious with the soup as well. We were starving after a long night and I don't anyone finished, not even the guys with their huge appetites. It's only $10 for a bowl.  That's a steal. It's like a pound or two of meat and oxtail can normally go for like $5+ per pound. I can't vouch for the other things but oxtail soup that's only served from 11pm to 9am is super good.",

Even though the selection is smaller than the big hotels, it has everything you need including unlimited coffee and juices. It's such a great deal! Their bacon, sausage, and corn beef hash are delicious. This cafe is one of the only few places that serve corn beef hash and they make it just the way I like it. Also, their oxtail soup is good. I minus one star because the fries came out cold and stale. But after informing the server, she immediately gave us fresh ones and apologized (which wasn't her fault). Our server was great.",

But you get prime rib, green beans, and your choice of brown rice or mashed potatoes or a baked potato. You can get the salad bar or soup and then cherry jubilee for dessert. For some reason the last time i went the cherry jubilee was really good and was the best part of my meal. I always get the salad bar because it's better than the soup...  What i hate about this place is the line to get seated. There always seem to be not many servers so you have to wait for a seat even though you could see 5-6 tables open from the line. I was in the line for 30 last time and it wasnt even that long. O well, it's the only place that was open with decent food. Needed to eat after gambling for a couple of hours.",

I did state in a previous review that whenever something is deemed as the 'best' ever, I am usually disappointed. I think this was the case. All of the hype over the soup had it so built up in my head, that it could never live up to my expectations. OR maybe it was due to the fact that the gentleman at the table next to me was obnoxiously eating the soup and making very loud noises and groans while he ate. I don't know -- it didn't ignite that kind of passion in me. I guess I just didn't get it. I would say that the soup was pretty good but I'm not drinking the koolaid like everyone else. I liked how big the portion was (big enough to split) and we had amazing service, even though they were extremely busy. We noticed that at least 50% of the restaurant (if not more) were ordering the soup, so it seems like the secret is out!  One important thing to note: the reviews don't lie. If you come here after 11 to get some of the soup, it'll be packed and you may have to wait for a table. Don't let it stop you though. Good things come to those who wait.",

We were seated right away but it took over 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive followed by another 20 minutes to take our order and another 30 minutes for our food to arrive. When the waitress brought our food, everything was cold except for the Saimin. #sigh",
