Im looking over the menu when she walks up aca tells me when I'm ready to order to just walk upto the counter. Mind you she did t wash her hands or anything, do I shrug finish looking at the menu and walk up to the menu....I place my order, after a question or 2, and HAND HER MY MONEY..... she places my change on the counter without hesitation and walks off. I leave then change.on the counter and proceed to walk off...I get to the door and I have a chnge of mind...so I walk bak over and tell her to cancel my order.

    "text": "Absolutely horrible!  We were starving and decided to try Amazing Thai for lunch on Sunday, Oct. 16th 2016.  I had high hopes that it would be good because it's much closer to the house than the usual Thai Restaurants we frequently visit.  We were greeted by two friendly employees as soon as we entered so I say to myself, \"Ok, so far so good.\"  We ordered the Wor Wonton soup, Crispy Duck and hot green tea.  The Wor Wonton was not bad and the hot green tea was your basic Lipton brand.  It quickly went downhill from here. The Crispy Duck was placed on our table and the server turned her back before I could order a bowl of rice so I had to flag her down.  I shouldn't have ordered the rice. It tasted like old Uncle Ben's instant rice.  We took about a minute looking at the Crispy Duck because it looked burnt, but again we were starving so we jumped in anyway.   Big mistake!  It tasted like it has been aged in the fridge for a few months and the gravy was nothing but fat drippings loaded with five spice.  If you've ever forgotten leftover poultry or beef uncovered in the fridge for a significant amount of time, you'll know what I'm talking about.  The meat has lost its moisture and the texture is powdery and stringy.   I kindly addressed our issue with our server and she apologized.  The restaurant still charged us half priced for the duck from which we only ate two pieces.  And on top of that, we were waiting at least 30 minutes for a second order of hot tea.  Don't let this restaurant ruin your day.  Believe me, there is nothing amazing about this place. Absolutely horrible!",

We were greated and seated promptly however that's where the service ended. I ordered the pineapple fried rice, one of my favorites. When my order arrived 10 minutes before my husbands it had no chicken and no pineapple. I would have mentioned it to the server however she was no where to be found. My husband ordered Beef Pad Thai. A different server brought that to him. It  overwhelmingly smelled of fish. So much so I could smell it across the table. My husband was unaware that it was made with fish sauce as it is not indicated on the menu. Worst experience in a long time. Very disappointing!!",

When I first saw that this was opening right around the corner, I couldn't wait to try it, but I will never order from here again. When I called to place an order the person on the phone was helping another customer with their take out order and asked me to hold. I did. She forgot. During the 22 minutes on hold she helped two customers to their tables and one more with a takeout order. I hung up, called 20 minutes later and finally placed my order. We had a large order - eggplant chips, fried wonton, crab ragoon, pork pad Thai, BBQ pork pad Thai, shrimp pad Thai, BBQ pork fried rice and Crispy duck. I actually liked the wonton and fried rice. My mother loved the crab ragoon  and was thrilled to actually find some crab in every bite (these days, there is no crab, just the cheese).  I will say it all arrived hot,neatly packaged, and none of the containers leaked. That is probably the only good thing I can say. The rest of the night we were all sick to our stomachs, including an 18-month old who only ate some fried rice.  Knowing we had a big order, I expected a delay in delivery. Was told 45 minutes, but it was an hour and a half (after peak dining times) before it arrived. We won't be ordering from here again.",

Both were very delicious, although the deep fried tofu and chow mein noodles were a bit too greasy.  They tasted great, but it upset my stomach a little later.  There were a variety of meat and vegetarian options.  One thing I would change is the level of service.  The service was very slow, and our entrees were brought out at different times, which is awkward.  We spent a lot of time waiting for our server.  We enjoyed the place overall and plan to go back to try other menu items.",

    "text": "In brief: Great place to eat. Great food with excellent flavor. Recommend Pad Kae Mow (Drunken Noodles), Thai Beef Jerky, Panang or Yellow Curry. Atmosphere a little bland/bare but definitely clean. People are kind, service mediocre. New restaurant getting their bearings. Great potential. Driven owners!!! All in all I would definitely recommend.  In Detail: Consider the fact that this review is based and compared to Thai restaurants throughout the valley and western US. (Amongst the ranks of Lotus of Siam, Komol, Archies, Pin Kaow, etc.) In other words I'm no newbie with Thai food, I have a black belt in Thai-food-o.  I have been to this restaurant a couple of times. Each time I took note of the service, quality and of course experience in all aspects.   As is a typical restaurant during their first days and months, things were a a little frazzled. I spoke briefly with a young woman who claimed to be the owner. She seemed to be excited and have a good intention and drive. After maybe 5 minutes I was acknowledged. I was seated and offered a free drink on the house in honor of the grand opening, their special Thai Float.   My order came out in about 15-20 minutes which included the appetizer and entree at the same time. I was left without water for some time. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal! The appetizer being Thai Beef Jerky (with the unique chili sauce) and Pad Kae Mao (Drunken Noodles). Soooo much flavor!!! After asking for a server to wrap up I paid for my bill on the owners personal cell phone. The Square reader made me trust that a bit more...   Overall it was a good experience. I give leniency due to it being the grand opening although I think everything should have a process that is precise. The owner and staff were nice and welcoming. The interior design was pleasant, little bare, but clean. I would definitely reccomend this restaurant for anyone looking for True and flavorful Thai. I look forward to coming again to try other dishes.   Update: I went once again with a bigger group. We were seated immediately. Took a bit for the barren table to acquire glasses and utensils. We all tasted the same dishes as above plus the Egg Roll appetizer, the Yellow Curry and Panang Curry. All were excellent once again!!! Soooo much flavor, really tasty.   Our dishes were brought after the other couple was halfway done with their meal (I didn't want them to have to wait for us :)) We were passed from server to sever. Despite that, the servers were all very kind. The amount of rice served with the huge bowl of curry (props to the upgraded dishes compared to previously!) was measly. Still sooo good. Worth the $2.00 for ever small bowl of rice.   Overall, once again a great experience. So happy I could recommend a place with quality food like this to some friends. We look forward to seeing the growth and positive changes to make this one of the  top Thai places in Vegas!!!",

    "text": "Tried this place on 2 occasions. 1st time was during lunch on a weekday, my husband and I were literally the only ones in the restaurant and we still waited about 5-7 mins for someone to finally come out and seat us. Once we were finally seated it probably took them about 10 mins to come over and take our order. Food was decent, small portions but I guess because it was their lunch specials. Waiters never came around to check on us or to refill our waters until we waved someone down, seemed like most of the staff were eating lunch at one of the tables when they knew we were the only customers in there. The only person that really helped us was the Hispanic woman, but she had left the restaurant for a bit assuming the rest of the staff would take care of us, which they didn't. Overall it wasn't a good experience considering the food wasn't the best and we've definitely had better.   Now due to the fact that this place keeps getting good reviews and ratings for some reason, we decided to give it another try. We came in on a Friday night so the restaurant was pretty busy, there were several tables available and a small line of us at the door waiting to be seated. There was only 3 people working in a packed restaurant so they could barely seat people right away nor did they offer adequate service. Took them again around 10 mins just for someone to finally come and take our order,  then probably 20-25 mins just for our small appetizer to come out. We ordered the crab Ragoon which was 6 small pieces for $6?! Ridiculous.. Pad Thai was decent but not the best and again a fairly small portion especially being dinner time.. the best dish was probably the crab fried rice which we did enjoy but that was probably the only highlight of the dinner. We had to wave someone down every time to get more water. The only accommodating waitress again was the Hispanic woman who was very sweet but it's very disorganized the way they handle their service since none of them seem to be assigned to one table and were all over the place the entire time. We will not be coming back here since we've already given them another try. We wanted to like this place since it's so close to home but looks like we'll stick to driving to China town for the good spots. I would definitely order the crab fried rice again, but take out only.",

    "text": "This is a nice neighborhood option if you are in the mood for Thai style food. I've been here 3 times so far for dine in and 1 time for takeout. The food and service is relatively good and if you like Thai tea then you are in luck because they offer free refills for dine in customers. If you haven't had this drink, it is very sweet and I think mixed with creamer or half and half. There are better options in terms of taste and variety available in Las Vegas area if you are truly a Thai food fan but if you don't feel like driving far then this is a great option. I would rate them 3.5 stars but since I haven't had a bad experience I rounded it up to 4 stars. Keep in mind that they get busy around early dinner 6-8 PM and also get a lot of takeout orders.",

I love Thai food, and having had the pleasure of eating True authentic Thai food, I've gotten spoiled and really picky about where I eat Thai. Living on this side of town I would always have to travel at least 30min to satisfy my Thai cravings. The other two Thai restaurant in this neighborhood are less than desirable. I'm super excited that North Las Vegas is finally on the map when it come to some really good Thai food.   The service and staff are pretty amazing as well. We had friends in town from California who had allergy restrictions, and everyone went above and beyond to accommodate the allergy. This is most definitely going to be my new go-to when I'm not in the mood to cook!   This is a MUST try! You won't regret it!   Food we ate:  Thai beef salad- best I have had in a while!!!  Drunken noodle- still my favorite! Some places make it really greasy, but this was really good I didn't want to stop eating it.  Veg stir fry with chicken- I never usually order chicken, I've been disappointed too many times by under seasoning or dry chicken, but this was just right.   Pad Thai- all I can say is yum! Steamed sea bass- was a little over cooked, but the taste was still there!",

At first i wasn't too happy with making a quick change in my order but when the order arrived it turned out to be great dish! I don't know what i was thinking when i ordered this dish but i thought some little tilapia fillets would arrive on my table but NOPE the whole frickin fish in chili sauce showed up LOL. It was a pretty big portion enough for 2 to 4 people. But it was delicious!!! We also ordered pad thai with shrimp and that wasn't bad either. Over all this place had decent service and good food. Not a bad place to try out if your in this area. Gave 4 stars because they should of told us the prawns was sold out before we even ordered.",

Another half an hour later, the driver finally shows up. Needless to say, we already started cooking dinner since it had been 2 hours (8pm). My husband was not friendly when he told the guy we order 2 hours ago and did not want the food anymore. After we closed the door, our neighbors heard him say that we should have picked our food up. He also sat in his car diagonal at the end of my street watching our house.   If I could have given 0 stars I would have. I am so displeased with how we were treated. I understand that mistakes happen and if the woman that I called would have explained that they forgot, I would have understood. Instead they lost a customer.",

    "text": "How does this place have 4 Stars? I had the Pad Thai, Fried Rice, orange chicken, egg rolls and another noodle - wide noodle chicken (can't remember the name).   OUR ORDER: Pad Thai - super greasy, a bit too sweet for me, but the noodles just had tons of oil. Tilted my plate and it pooled to the side.   Fried rice: actually decent, but let's be real, it's fried rice. We are not talking about something that's difficult to make nor hard to find. Case in point, Panda Express.  Orang Chicken: Chicken had zero flavor, clearly not seasoned before it was battered and/or the flour and batter were probably not seasoned, as well.  Wide noodle pad Thai: super greasy, my plate literally had oil dripping from it. The Chicken in the dish was dryer than the Sahara desert. Chewy too.  Egg Rolls: DISGUSTING. clearly fried in a fryer that was set at too low of a temperature. Like the noodles, dripping with oil.    I will never order from the \"Unamazing Thai Restaurant\" again. I had also ordered 3 Diet Cokes. When my order was delivered, they only gave me 1, so I called and the delivery guy brought back two more, but they were regular Pepsi, not Diet Coke. I tried calling back a couple times and kept getting a message saying they were not available and to try back later. My order of 5 entrees/dishes and 3 drinks came out to $65, which is an absolute shame for a bunch of Over-priced, poorly cooked, under seasoned, soaked in oil CRAP!",

The mango sticky rice is just alright but at least it's vegan.  The curry fries are barley seasoned I don't taste even a hint of Curry. I'm not a fan of the milk green tea, too sweet . And FYI they CANT make Curry without fish sauce. It was very hard to get ahold of them I called the number they have listed on yelp and at first it would not go through at all then finally after ten minutes it would ring and I let it ring for almost 2 minutes before someone answered. Over all frustrating experience when all I wanted was easy take out. Ughhhhh",

Host Came up to podium told us to follow him, sat menus at table (right in front of the kitchen door) and walked away (never looked back at us, never asked if that was ok, just walked off). We stood there waiting for a couple minutes to ask him if we could move to somewhere quieter, but he never came back, so we moved. Waited 20/30 minutes to have a server come up and no one ever did (it's a small place and host was right in front of us where he can see us) never told a server we were there. Finally I spoke out and said we were ready to order. Then I said I wanted soup, he advised a meal (I don't know what name), when the food came out (30 minutes later), it was not a soup. He got mad that it was sent back. That's his language barrier, not mine, I spoke English and said soup! When we finished eating, we wanted to order dessert, waited another 20 minutes before my husband got up and placed order at podium, which he said that same host was walking back and fourth avoiding him. 30 minutes after waiting for fucken rice and ice cream dessert, we finally walked up to the podium and said forget it, we are leaving, please charge us, he still tried charging us for the noodles we sent back and the dessert!!! Holy fucken cow! Mind blown! DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!!! Be advised! Unless that asswhole gets let go, I am never going back!",

    "text": "Amazing Thai. Amazing...no. Thai...yes.  We stopped in for lunch. I love seeing new restaurants open up on our side of the valley, because I feel North Las Vegas is a lot slower at that in comparison to the Southwest/Southeast. It was a great opportunity to support the Thai movement business in hopes we no longer have to do the drive. We still do...but this place is definitely an emergency lunch option. Emergency as in if I have to sit in the car for 2 minutes more listening to all the shit I hear back there, I am going to lose my head. Jokes aside.   It was 12 something and we entered. I immediately felt  like it needed to be jazzed up. I get it, they're still new...maybe they're feeling it out before they completely invest anymore money for decor, etc...quickly we were greeted then seated. Great!  We sat and dove right into the menu. I didn't care to go through because I knew I was going to get something off their lunch special. My phone seriously auto-spelled sexual vs special. Good thing I caught thaaat typo. I'm going off the subject again. Once we were seated the waitress went off somewhere so drink orders happened some minutes later.  Lunch specials are 6.95. An entree from selected lunch menu, soup of the day, spring roll, salad, and steamed rice. That's a pretty good deal around this 'hood I must say! I had the spicy eggplant no meat. Husband had the red curry with beef. Ordered the toddlers the beef fried rice. Also, I had to try the Thai iced green tea. 3 bucks free refills! Spiffy! Haven't frequented much Thai joints, but enough to say none of them offers FREE refills on their Thai teas/Thai green teas. Winner.  There was only 1 worker working that room. Upon entering there were about 5 people in there, when we left there were about 6. She did her best being the only one, but we surely experienced the delay between her going back and forth with orders, disappearing for a moments time...I'm thinking she was helping cook too? But I don't know. Although service was a 3 to me...I have to give her 4 stars from being as attentive as she possible could giving her circumstance.   Soup of the day was a bowl of their tom yum soup. While I didn't think it was bad, I wished it wasn't served so lukewarm, and it also was a lot sweeter than I'm accustomed to. I finished it anyways as it wasn't that bad but certainly isn't the best.   When we got our food I noticed I had no steamed rice. I looked at my husband then said, this is healthy stuff, I got a salad and spicy eggplant. Do I not get rice or something? He says, of course you do. Yeah...of course I do. I'll wave her down. This is one of the instances disappearing for a moments time is in effect. As my husband is going to town with his curry eating away...I've managed to finish my salad, the salad on my sons plate, my eggroll, and empty out my green tea before I was able to wave her over. She eventually popped out but then she had to help a to-go order, then she was bringing out a dish to an elderly couple, she was busy. I get it. My rice quickly arrived as soon as I told her.  My dish was a 5 level in heat; it packed a pretty good heat. The chest was warm. I thought the weather was cooling down? Lol. They definitely pack heat even at a 5. My husband said his red curry was pretty good. Surprise surprise and surprise surprise that I'm even typing surprise surprise.   HOWEVER, the beef fried rice was funky. We didn't finish the meat in it. The meat was cold? I thought, maybe it's cold because it sat for a moment before I scooped into it. I tried the meat to begin with 'cause in my mind...if the beef taste good...it's all gonna be good. The beef being cold, the rice warm...do they precook meat? If so...uh, stop. Not only that, the meat was tough and it tasted old. Here's when you know I'm not crazy, even my 3 year old who eats everything quit and said, mommy don't like it. as in don't feed me the meat just give me the rice.  The rice was more like sticky rice kind fried rice which is good, but wasn't good here. The rice lacked a certain quality or freshness to me, but that's just me. A little salted on some bites. That Thai iced green tea is good stuff. I know for sure I'd be back just so I can order it.   Overall, twas alright. I'd recommend them for sure because for a 6.95 lunch special paired with refillable Thai teas?! yes please! One of those suffice status restaurants. I'm just not yet convince this is a place I'm willing to drop full menu price for. They're certainly still working on their kinks. Definitely kid and stroller friendly!",

I stood in their lobby for 20 minutes and no one came to greet, take my name, or say a wait time. Two more parties arrived and were waiting behind me. The total time I was there I saw 2 people working and there were no open tables. It's really annoying that a waiter gave out two food orders to door dash people but still did not acknowledge the people wanting to dine in.",

    "text": "Their Tom Yum fried rice with chicken was truly outstanding. Spice level 5/10 made it so we could still taste all the flavors but still enjoy the necessary kick that makes Thai food Thai food.  I loved the menu options and wanted to get one of everything.  Pad see ew with bbq pork had even fatter noodles than most places. Kudos for making that happen. I love fat noodles. The flavor was great and it came out quick. I forgot this time but I normally substitute their broccoli for American broccoli simply because I prefer the texture. Think about it  The shrimp rolls were okay. They come fried, with a sauce, and the shrimp are a good size, not to mention they come with a lot. Perhaps I'd enjoy them more if we had more ppl and it wasn't the only side option (I like variety).  The Pad Thai was thuper good. It didn't seem to have any spice level to me but my friend was dying across the table. It's a mystery.  Portion sizes were flattering. We had a healthy amount to take home for the spouse. A mega plus!  We came for a birthday and got the Amazing Tree ice cream dessert (they don't offer birthday candles yet). It made us smile and added a bit of special to the meal, that needed something for a birthday dinner. Chocolate ice cream under the chocolate crumble \"dirt.\"  The \"rock\" candies were like a heavier textured M&M. We didn't eat the tree. I say give it a go  Service wasn't that outstanding but that could just be a cultural thing. We walked in and most of the tables needed to be wiped down still. Looked like we got the end of the rush. Most Thai places don't look as modern or as updated as this restaurant and it made for a nice change.   Amazing Thai may have taken the top spot to satisfy my Thai food cravings",

We were greeted by May, the wife of Chef Palord. The dining room is lovely, hand painted gold on a tan background. Subtle and warm. We ordered the Tom Kha soup with Chicken, Spicy Eggplant with Beef and Orange Chicken, all with level 2 spiciness (cause I'm a wimp!). The soup had lots of white meat chicken and lots of mushrooms in a delicious, creamy broth. The eggplant with beef was served with a big bowl of white rice. I usually don't enjoy cooked green peppers, but in this dish they were super. The orange chicken was sprinkled with sesame seeds & served with fresh orange slices. At the end of our meal, Chef Palord visited our table - what a treat!  We will definitely be back!",

The service is great, and that's why I didn't just give it one star. The restaurant is clean, sparse, but inviting. There, the goodness stops.  The food was below par, lacking in the subtle layers of flavor Thai food is so well known for, and every dish was swimming in grease. Noodles were stuck together, and even the fried rice had no taste. The portions were generous. My husband's Larb had a strange sweetness to it, and not enough vinegar. Nothing eaten here could compare with Chai Tips, just a few miles away.   Nothing eaten here could compare to Thai Basil, just across Simmons. Amazing Thai is much pricier than Chai Tips, but the food quality is below par. We won't be going back, even though the staff could not be nicer, nor the place cleaner. It's just in need of a chef who can bring out the unique notes of Thai food. Hopefully, it will improve in time, and with a new chef.   Until then, Chai Tips and Thai Basil will continue to be our \"Go TO\" Asian restaurants in our area.",

I have a feeling this is like many other plaza shops that just change their name from a failing business.  Rice: Not Jasmine.  Cheap rice that smells dirty.  Yellow curry with chicken:  Chicken was likely boiled in water then thrown into the sauce because the chicken had zero flavor.  Sauce seperates after a few minutes indicating a \"just add water\" mix.  Pad see eiw with chicken: Greasy and charred.  Broccoli tasted old.  Bland with no added flavor.  Mixed vegetable stir-fry with tofu: I blame myself for ordering this at a \"thai\" restaurant.  Panda express makes a better stir fry. Tofu was the soft version.  Not good for frying.  Ill stick to my spot downtown over this nearby dining option.",

The waitress/manager that took our order was so busy trying to fix a take out order she forgot to put our order in.  When I asked another waitress about our order, it took another 15 minutes before I finally went up to the register to find out about our order.  By this time we had already been there over 45 minutes.  The Manager said she would put our order in and wouldn't have to pay for our meal, but we had plans and we already wasted over 45 minutes.  We tried their take out once and the food wasn't hot when we received it, so we thought we would try dining in.  That was worse.  After 2 strikes, they lost our business!!",

Order the following:  Chicken Satay: pretty bland and not even warm (I live 10 mins away) Fried chicken appetizer: Extremely dry and tasted like day old microwaved chicken.  Crab Ragoon: this was ok but nothing special Chicken Kow Soi: The spice level was good and again nothing to brag about. I mentioned no red onions a few times but they seemed to have put a dozen in there.  Agedashi Tofu: My wife took a few bites and threw it away  We tried everything we wanted to and it was pretty bad in my opinion and will definitely not go back. We'll stick with Plumeria Thai instead.",

I dined for lunch at about 3:30 (lunch specials 11-4) and there was no one else in the restaurant except for the two people who came in to pick up their orders. The dining room and restrooms were immaculate! Loved the fresh flower bouquets on each table-very nice touch!  I ordered the lunch special panang curry with pork. The soup of the day - a nice broth with vegetables - came out before I even ordered my meal. It was soooo comforting on a rainy, cold day. Then, perfectly timed, the main course arrived with a lovely, crunchy egg roll, steamed rice (basmati I believe), and a salad with a nice, nutty flavored dressing.   The whole shebang came to just $7.50 plus tip of course. The waitress brought me a yummy piece of chocolate and wished me a Merry Christmas.",

We ordered egg rolls. chicken panang curry, 2 beef and beef meatball noodle soups and 2 Thai green teas. The owner was really nice and said that she could save our address for next time, if we wanted delivery. The delivery cost would be $3. That was convenient to know. The egg rolls were vegetable egg rolls were crunchy, but the sauce was watered down. The chicken panang curry was absolutely delicious. The richness in flavor of spices will definitely have us back to order more. We ordered a spice level 6/10, which turned out to be perfect! This order also came with a serving of white rice, which was cooked well. The broth of the beef soup was good, it was slightly lacking the real depth of flavor my family and I have had in other beef soups we have had in the past. The beef was a little more on the tougher side and the meatballs were fine (typical). The Thai green tea would be something we won't get again. Can't quite put a finger on it. Gonna deff try the regular Thai tea next time, though. Overall, I'm curious about other menu items, so we will be back!",

First of all the menu we were given was a To Go one printed in a very small font and was very difficult to read. The server apologised and explained the new ones were on the way. Until they arrive, I suggest getting the printer to give you 30 just to use in the meantime.   We ordered the lunch special, and it is a great price starting at $6.95 and it included a salad, egg roll, salad and an entree. When the soup arrived it was mushrooms in a tomato based broth. First of all, the broth was lukewarm and secondly the mushrooms were virtually raw and almost cool. I realize it was early, 11:00 but that was unacceptable. The server was very nice and explained the different types of curry. Last week I tried the Panang and was disappointed in the flavor, and the texture of the chicken. This time I tried the Red Curry and Beef. Again, the meat texture was off, they are marinating the meat, but the flavor is not coming through. The curry sauce was OK but I was not wowed. My salad had some pieces that were slightly wilted and it was drenched in a bottled dressing. They do get points for the presentation, it was beautiful. The decor is fresh and modern but I am not a fan of TV's when I am dining, and on top of that the music was on so there was a show with music as the background.   I wish the food was as good as the service, and maybe they just need the time to work on the delivery of the menu items,",

We live somewhere pretty easy to deliver to (we're even on a corner) but the guy kept complaining about not being able to find us & didn't say thanks or apologize for being super late.

If you walk in here and the place is empty, don't sweat and turn around to the exit. The majority of customers order out or come in to pick up their take out orders. Take a seat and start ordering.  Curry Takoyaki: This is a tasty spin on Japanese octopus balls with just a thin drizzle of curry sauce.   Thai Papaya Salad: Shredded papaya salad with romaine lettuce and tomato wedges. Refreshing and flavorful especially with the inclusion of shrimp - I believe this might be an additional cost.  Panang Cury (sauteed tofu): LOVE this, and it's perfect at a spicy level seven. This is chock-full of soft, sauteed tofu and green and red bell peppers. The curry is exceptionally flavorful.  (Note that all entrees come with rice, and you do have the option to sub out the white rice with brown rice for an additional cost.)  The staff here does a great job ensuring that customers are pleased with their meal and experience. They're always coming around to tables to make sure that beverages receive refills and to clear up plates.  Although I've been here twice, I've told all that Thai food lovers I know to give this restaurant a try. I'm loving this restaurant and will continue to frequent it.",

I asked about the Pineapple Fried Rice and nowhere on the menu does it say it has curry in it and the server didn't tell me either. I hate curry. The Pad See Ew was just ok and the Tom Yum Noodle soup was actually kind of gross. I'm not really sure what flavors were happening in that bowl, but it wasn't good.   Will definitely not be coming back here.",

    "text": "I've been here quite a few times because it's one of the few Thai places that I like that is near my house. Only dined in once, but I usually order to go. Whenever I'm here, there's usually only 2-3 other groups eating here. They get a lot of pick up orders - while I was eating, there was probably 5 people that came in to pick up their food.  Anyways, we ordered Chicken Panang, Khao Soi with Chicken, and Seafood House Fried Rice. There are some reviews that say their food is average - I think it's great and very flavorful. If you're not a picky eater, you'll enjoy this place. They cook their food here on the spicy side, but I like it that way. Also, they charge $1 for extra ingredients in their foods, such as basil or bamboo shoots. One downside is that their food does take somewhat of a long time to come out, but the servers would always check back to our table and update us when they can. This isn't a super big restaurant where there's lots of people cooking in the back so I understand. I like this place, so I can be patient about waiting a little longer than usual for my delicious food.  Sidenote: Overheard a conversation with another customer where they got her chicken satay order wrong and a lady employee here, who I'm assuming is the manager, insisted that a make-up order be made totally free of charge for her. The manager recognized that she was a regular to this restaurant and wanted to make sure she left happy. After reading reviews about bad customers service, it's nice to see now that they really care about their customers.",

    "text": "I do not understand how this place has gotten such good reviews. Maybe we went on an off night, but it wasnt crowded at all so I'm not sure why service was so awful. Ok where to start... The service was terrible, we never saw our waitress after the food made it to the table. Not once to pick up any dirty dishes, to ask how the food was, and at one point I got up to find our waitress to ask for more napkins, found her and she said she would bring them right over. Yea we never got those napkins. Also, the way they brought the food out to the table was so unpleasant. There was easily a 10-15 minute gap from the time the first dish got the to table to the time the last dish got to the table. It was like they were preparing one plate at a time and just bringing them out as they were ready. Since when do restaurants not bring all the dishes out at once.  By the time my mom got her food, the rest of us were almost done.  As for the food, my beef salad was extremely fishy. This was probably the worst beef salad I've ever had. Not one person at the table liked it. The cuts of the beef were very big, and it was difficult to cut since the only utensil they give is a single fork. My husband ordered some sweet chili chicken, and he asked the waitress how it was prepared.  She stated it was a stir fry with pineapple, red and green bell peppers and onion. Sounds delicious right? Well that's not what he got. It was this deep fried breaded chicken with some thick chili sauce, like you would get from a fast food chinese restaurant.  There were no bell peppers or any thing like the waitress described. The best part of the meal was the chicken larb. The flavors were great and it tasted fresh.   All in all, one star is the most I could give this place.",

    "text": "Really great restaurant on Northside! Amazing food menu, seriously everything we ordered were great. The papaya salad had the right amount of acidity and sweetness to it and was wonderfully refreshing. If you pair it with sticky rice and soak the rice in the dressing, the pairing tastes really, really good. I ordered the BBQ pork pad see eiw and it was the perfect serving amount, perfectly balance flavors. Often pad see eiw is too salty, but theirs was seasoned well and noodles nicely cooked. We also had the fried tofu, which itself was only okay, but with the sauce it came with was divine. It was sweet and a little tangy which complimented the tofu amazingly well. For dessert, I wanted the mango beach ice cream but they only had it seasonally so I wasnt able to get it. Instead, they recommend the fried banana ball, which was such a great recommendation. The bananas was super ripe and sweet, and inside the fried coconut, the ball of dessert were to die for. Highly recommend it with coconut ice cream and it's just a perfect end. Also, the service is amazing. All the staff were extremely attentive and friendly and it's obvious they know their patrons well, from their regulars to new ones. Seriously have no complaints with this place at all. If you are in Northside Las Vegas, this restaurant is definitely worth the trip. They're the definition of amazing hole-in-the-wall restaurant.",

But this location's pad Thai they seem like they put Ketchup in it.  Pineapple Stir Rice should be more stirred fried with seasoned taste, it was a mixed rice for me rather than stirred fried. If we were done in, we could have asked the chef to cook more though, we took home so had to recook again   So we wouldn't order from here again. If you are just hungry then please go ahead.",

Our visit was intended to be the second of many due to the fact that we live 5 minutes away. First off, my husband and I went in eager and hungry for some yummy Thai soup. We are seated and after a few minutes a server approaches us (without introducing herself) asking, Are you ready to order or do you need more time?  I replied, I'm ready!? She states, Oh hold on....I'll be right back.  She went behind a bar chated with a coworker then proceeded to assist two other customers whom came in for their pick up. We eventually ordered our food. I ordered the cucumber salad and my husband his usual wing order with two separate soups. We specifically ordered lime based soups with noodles. Lone and behold we are served coconut based soups. Now mind you the server did come back and ask, if the soup was to include noodles? We replied yes, thank you. Not to mention that I had to get up and approach the server in order to ask for more salad dressing. So, I've pretty much know that I will not be returning due to that fact the management has no regard for their customers along with the very poor service. It's one thing to make a customer wait but to get the main entree entirely wrong is very poor service. All I can say is that I'll definitely drive to Chinatown and visit Pho Kim Long every time I am feeling like eating Yummy Thai soup. Thanks for reading!  =/",

Too bad I have moved now here on the south side but sometimes when I get the craving I would literally do the drive for their shrimp pad Thai and mango coconut sticky rice dessert. It just won't compare to no other.  I love Thai food and their pad thai noodles are the one to crave for. So gooooddd!",

A hint of soy sauce and sliced jalapeno made It tasty.  I ordered the chicken Thai basil and I wasn't disappointed.  The restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly.  They do a lot of takeout from the looks of it while we were there.  I definitely will be back.",

We eat here quite often and always ordered through Uber which now no longer carries this restaurant. We LOVE the food but today we went to pick it up and they hadn't even reviewed or started making our order when we showed up at the time it was promised. They kept trying to give us orders that weren't ours and offered no apologies or compensation for us waiting over 20 minutes (which was a total of 40 minutes from when we ordered). Disappointed that the pick up service was not what it should of been.",

When we ordered take out we used their website because no one would answer the phone after trying to call at least 5 times.  Tonight we could not reach them by phone again so we ordered through their website and ordered delivery this time. An hour later, I called to check on the status and got no answer.  Tried again 10 mins later and finally reached someone who put me on hold then came back to tell me that a few orders didn't come through on their website when the order was placed and they didn't receive mine until an hour after I placed my order and it would be another 40 mins for delivery.  We live 5 mins from this restaurant so we were not anticipating a 2 hour wait for dinner when placed the order.  Needless to say we cancelled and will NEVER use their website or order delivery from this restaurant again. I would say your only option is to eat there in person since their website is unreliable and they do not answer the phone.",

About 30 minutes passes and we notice everyone around us (who had arrived after us) was receiving their food but we still hadn't. One person in our party ordered the duck so we thought that might have been the hold up. Our server never once came to our table to check on us in that time. ANYWAY, after almost an hour of waiting, our server came up to us and said she forgot to put in our order and asked us to reorder what we had before. By this time, we were over it so we said that we'd just take the bill for our drinks and one appetizer. Instead of our server comping the $10 bill when she messed up so badly, she still brought it out. I was shocked. Why not just comp the drinks and $5 rangoons?!? I've worked in the service industry for so long. This whole experience was a twilight zone for \"what not to do when working in a restaurant\". Awful awful awful.",

This place is a little tricky to find at night since there outside sign foes not light up, but it is in the Albertson's shopping center on Ann and Simmons. Upon entering we sat ourselves and waited for a few minutes for a menu. We ordered the chicken satay, crab fried rice, bbq pork pad thai and pad prik king.   The chicken satay was delicious! Hint of curry flavor, moist and came with a delicious dipping sauce. The cucumber salad side was tasty but came with so little. The crab fried rice was surprisingly tasty, though the rice in general had simple flavors the crab was definitely present. I could have just ate that rice. The pad thai was meh, nothing to oogle over... was just a little too sweet for my taste. The pad prik king we got with chicken, it was flavorful and spicy! But not so spicy that you couldn't tastes the depths of the spices.   This place stayed fairly the evening we went. They also get a lot of to go orders that were picked up by customer, ubereats, eat 24, and I believe grubhub.   I'd come here again or at least order something to go or for delivery. Overall the meal was enjoyable, just lost me a little at service, location visibility, and some of the flavors being only decent. Seems like a great place if I want to order in one day!",

The food does take a while so be warned, we waited over 20 minutes to get 3 dishes and the restaurant wasn't busy.   The food was good, nothing that would make it a memorable moment but decent enough to satisfied my hunger. The portions are very good and the flavor is there, there is no wow factor.   Side note, their credit card minimum is $7 so if you are thinking about just getting a lunch special by yourself, you will have to get a drink with that.",

We called-in for our food at 6:49 on Friday and was told our food (4 entrees: pineapple fried rice, spicy basil chicken, pad see ew, and beef salad) would take 20 minutes by the woman who answered the phone. We ordered pickup and not delivery. We got there a little before time and waited, and waited...and waited. We waited for 45 mins before I finally lost patience and found the hostess who was at the back counter, who did not look as if she was terribly busy, and asked where my food was and why was it taking so long. I told her that three people came after me and left before me with their large orders. She said that these people placed pickup orders before I did. I said \"why would you tell me it would take 20 mins then?\" And she had nothing to say. She went into the kitchen and my food was already sitting there because she immediately brought it up. I paid and left. When we got home, like I said, food was nothing special and beef salad tasted weird. Don't know why most people give it great reviews. There are numerous decent Thai places here in Vegas, and this place is not one I will be giving my business to again. I feel cheated out of $45 and being treated like a second rate customer. DON'T LIE TO THE CUSTOMER ABOUT THE TIME IT TAKES FOR FOOD TO GET READY SO I CAN BE COERCED INTO YOUR RESTAURANT TO EAT YOUR BEEF SALAD AND PAD SEE EW FULL OF LIES.",

We ordered the egg rolls (best I've ever tasted in my whole life), chicken pad Thai and the crispy duck fried rice. The pad Thai was well flavored just think I may up it in the spice scale next time I'm here (not their fault). I've never been able to find crispy fried rice at any Thai restaurant and their's was crispy (well d'uh), moist, flavorful, and complimented the fried rice and Chinese broccoli perfectly. Michelle was our server and she was friendly, quick, and was there whenever we needed something. I will come back not only for the food but for Michelle's service as well. For a finale we got the mango sticky rice, my fiancee is NOT a mango fan, but she loved this dish. It was the perfect amount of sweet and tart that balanced the dish very well. Can't wait to come back!! With the appetizers, entrees, and desserts, the whole check came to $40. Very reasonably priced. Thanks!!",

We ordered online for delivery, with an assured delivery of 45-60 mins, and after 90 minutes nothing had arrived. We called and after giving our name numerous times no one seemed to know who we were. Our credit card had already been charged so we gave it another few minutes then called again. They still had no record of even having our order, then put us on hold for 10 minutes the whole time we could hear them helping other customers. At this point all we wanted was to cancel the order. We finally hung up, after no one ever came back to assist us or even let us know they were looking into it, and refused the charges on the credit card. Extremely disappointed with Amazing Thai.",

    "text": "Not so Amazing Thai Restaurant, sorry....I'd say depending on what you order is what you will think of the place. I ordered papya salad, panang curry and the Tom Yom soup. I ordered from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Feat24.com&s=f6a43a39d83313a99e0c9648cc2dfb057d7893980b27777fec0cb32d6333a670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eat24.com</a> based on good reviews from Yelp and eat24. Let me just say my first impression of it sucked. I eat asain food a ton and honestly I primarily shop at asain markets and what I cook at home is mostly asain. I cook a lot and when I order out I expect it it be just as good as how I cook it at home and when it's worse than that, that's how you know it really sucks. I make papya salad at home and when I took a bite of the \"Amazing Thai food\", papya salad all I tasted was lime. I knew it was missing quite a few things, like garlic, crab paste, tamarind paste etc. I told you I cook a lot at home and this was totally disappointing. Especially the Tom Yom, I asked for not spicy and it was spicy and normally Tom Yom soup is Citrus-Y but instead it was very sweet. I had to doctor it up and add my own pepper salt and lime just to make it taste good enough to eat it. The one time I decide not to cook for myself at home and I get pinned with disappointing Thai food based on good reviews. Eating out is supposed to be a luxury not a disappointment. Maybe I should come in and teach a cooking lesson because apparently I am more Thai then the chef. Shake my head. Little dumping is better than this ( that's what I normally order)and it has less stars so apparently this thai audience hasn't even stepped foot into a really good asain food place. Oh and they were skimpy on the curry with the chicken. I'd say it's decent but not $30 worth ever again.",

The dipping sauce was also a great compliment to the egg rolls.   Side salad 4/5  The side salad that comes with the lunch special was good. I loved the salad dressing. It was ginger vinaigrette.  Thai ice tea 5/5  Loved it!",

The dishes were fresh and hints of citrus, basil, cilantro and spice were light and refreshing...We will be ordering here from now on...",

It was a roach hotel !!!! I brought it up to the waitress and she grabbed it (super gross) flipped it around like and acted like she had no idea what it was...until I showed her where it said roach motel ....smh  It was sitting on top of the bench by the table...I felt like throwing up ...I told her if I saw that first we would've never sat down ...smh",

Recently I decided to give them another try but this time I ordered for delivery and the service was a lot faster, food arrived well packaged and still warm. The quality/flavor of their food was never a disappointment. I was not disappointed this time either. The beef salad was refreshing and got a good kick to it. The beef Pad Thai was delicious and fully satisfied my husband's crave for Thai food. Overall, I think it'll still be a while before I dine in at this place again just because it took over 2 hours for my husband and I to have dinner here last time; but I definitely enjoy their flavorful dishes and will continue to order to go and/or for delivery.",

I ordered through Uber eats and after more than 2 hours of calling the restaurant 8 times because of the delays in my order and them NOT answering the phone the person who answered was extremely unhelpful LYING to me saying they didn't receive my order then saying that they had my order but their app was down and though they would be happy to cancel my order because they hadn't started cooking my order yet after 1  hour 15 minutes they couldn't because the app and that I needed to call Uber eats.   Then I called Uber eats and they called the restaurant and the restaurant claimed to have already prepared my food and that nothing was wrong with their app and they refused to cancel.   After escalating I was finally able to get the order cancelled and refunded after 2 hours and 8 minutes and them never starting my order. I would never go to this restaurant even if it was free and I do not recommend it because their customer service is trash. I wish I could give zero star rating.",

So if you can't handle the heat lol stay at a spice level of 5, it's a True medium.   We tried a few of their dishes, Tom Yum soup, pad Thai, and Mongolian beef. They have the best chicken Tom Yum soup I've tasted in Las Vegas. And I've been to at least 10 different Thai places here. Not the best I've ever had but definitely the 2nd best. It was so flavorful, the spice level was on point. We got the soup in a spice level of 5 and it was delicious. You can taste the chili and all the spices combined. It was amazing !!!!  We had the Chicken pad Thai at a spice level of 7. It was so bomb!!! It was a little too spicy for my fiance, he has sensitive taste buds. But it was perfect for me. The chicken they used was amazing and they had green onion inside of it. Super good.   Then the Mongolian beef. The Mongolian beef was really good. We got it without bell pepper and extra green onions and it was very flavorful, spice level at 6. You can really taste all the flavors it was awesome. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was all the wontons on top. The out a bunch of them on top and they're okay but I felt like they were in the way. I just put it off to the side.   All the good was really amazing though, they didn't disappoint. The only thing that needed some work was the service. They only checked on us once or twice after we orders and got our food. We waited a lil white to get noticed that we were finished and wanted boxes and the check. But other than that, this place stood up to its name and met all my expectations.   I highly recommend this place.",

I get the drunken noodles without the onions and bamboo, and the remaining bell peppers, steamed tofu, and mushrooms are plenty for me. The mushrooms are out of this world! They're probably my favorite part of the drunken noodles. The Thai basil tofu comes with a side of rice and also comes with bell peppers. Both are spicy dishes.   It's rare that we eat in, but if we do we're all over the Thai iced tea! It's legit delicious. Even better, Amazing Thai is the only place I've ever been to that gives refills. Make sure you ask for coconut milk for your tasty tea. ;)  The only drawbacks for Amazing Thai is its smaller portion sizes and the steep-ish prices. My order of drunken noodles and a Thai iced tea came to $17+. That is waaay too much money to spend on one person for delivery. Still, I'll keep coming back because the food is consistently good.

    "text": "Truely amazing thai food! Me and my boyfriend got our food delivered to us from here instead of the same old chinese place we normally get.   Vegetable Noodle Soup - I ordered this one not really expecting much, but I wanted something easy on my tummy because I didn't feel well. This was the PERFECT thing for the flu. The broth was very mild. I was super impressed with how perfectly the veggies were cooked. Also it was thoughtful that they put the noodles on the side so they didn't get soggy through delivery. The noodles were well cooked thin rice noodles seasoned with garlic. Was just what I needed to feel better!  Red Curry with tofu - Let me start by saying the portion was intense. While curry normally comes in a little tiny bowl, it came in a giant soup bowl. This was perfect cause there was definately a good left over portion. The curry itself was a little soupy instead of creamy but I didn't even mind it because the flavor was so good.   Can't wait to reorder!",

Delicious pad thai, chicken panang, and OMG, where have eggplant chips been all my life??? The only slightly unfortunate part was that the website said the food would be delivered in 28 minutes but it actually took an hour. It would probably have been even better served hot in the restaurant, but allowances must be made for personal laziness!",

The food quality, presentation, and serving has not been on par with my earlier experiences. And if you ask for a spice level 3, you can bet your butt it'll be the equivalent of 8 in most places. I don't like to send my food back but I had to when my nose starting running on the first bite and persisted its burn for an hour after I ate!  The Lad na noodles I usually ordered that bathed in a luxurious silken gravy are now being served in a big congealed mass of fried goo. Apparently, \"it's our signature dish.\" And if you order duck fried rice, be prepared to tear through a side of sinewy duck. It makes me wonder what happened.  Perhaps it's not just my experience since on the three most recent visits, the place was nearly empty. Even with few patrons, it took at least five minutes to be greeted another ten to place an order. And there was no refill of my water or checking to see if I needed anything either.   Still, it's in my neck of the woods and when I'm desperate and lazy, I'll pop by but if I really want authentic Thai, I'm going to have to make the trek into the city.",

It was very sweet in comparison how it traditionally would taste more broth like, the veggies and tofu were good though. My boyfriend ordered the chicken wings and Yum Woon Sen which I'm pretty sure is called \"silver noodle salad\" at most other places, that tasted better than the soup. Still a little sweeter than I'm used to but otherwise delicious. I could see myself ordering that in the future. The wings I didn't try but my boyfriend said they were \"bomb\". I'd trust his word as he's eaten this dish at different locations of Thai restaurants throughout the valley haha.   Overall this is a nice restaurant but don't come in expecting it to taste authentic. I'd say this location is a little more Americanized-Thai.",

Their peanut sauce for the satay is awesome.  We have tried almost everything on the menu and have not had a bad meal yet.  The servers are super friendly.  They remember us even when we haven't sat in the restaurant for a while (we mostly do takeout)   The only reason I do not give them 5 stars is because their takeout is very slow.  They tell me it'll be ready at a certain time but it is still 20-30 minutes after that.    I don't want to recommend them because I don't want share them.",

Japanese, Indian, Thai, you name it... if it's curry I love it, but a lot of places just aren't good at making it. This place is soooo good at it. Their yellow and green curry are more on a sweet side compared to others that I've had, but the sweet goes so well with the spice. I got a 5 and it was pretty spicy so beware of a 10  oh and all of my items were vegan... no meat in either curry, it's made with coconut milk... just extra yummy veggies. And I skip on the tofu option usually.",

The response from girl upfront was \"You have to wait, they are busy\" and cant deal with you now. I let them know i pay their paychecks, and she preceded with her attitude that was so unnecessary.

That is extremely disappointing! Craving the eggroll is literally the reason I decided to try the place. But I wasn't going to drive back.  I got yellow curry and \"upgraded\" to the egg fried rice for an additional $2. The curry was ok but didn't seem to contain any potatoes. Mostly sauce... it felt more like soup. The egg fried rice was just bad. Very mushy with a weird taste.  I wish more of these reviews focused on the taste of the food rather than the service/prices/decor. I tried it because of the star rating but didn't read closely enough to realize that the food is gross and a lot of these ratings are based on other things. All that other stuff is kind of pointless if you don't have good food to begin with.  The pickup experience was average for a small Thai place but wasn't worth it. I wish I had just gone to Carl's Jr. because this was an awful waste of my Saturday calorie budget. I am very disappointed. Anyway, I'm leaving this review so maybe someone else doesn't make the same mistake.",

More specifically, I attempted to order food and was placed on a long hold just because customers had entered the restaurant-which I later found out. When my phone call was picked back up (what seemed like 5 minutes later) it was a different person all together. She wanted me to repeat my order when I had already been given a price and a estimated time to pick it up. My call was handled poorly and she made an excuse by saying oh customers entered the restaurant which was why I was placed on hold. I refused to repeat myself especially after hearing her defend the previous individual. Its not worth it, so I hung up and I'm not going back. Rude!",

The potstickers come drizzled in some kind of \"secret sauce\" that is absolutely to die for.  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, but I asked for it to be an 8/10 spicy.  It wasn't very spicy at all, but the flavor of their sweet and sour combined with the chili powder made for an extraordinary flavor.  My girlfriend always orders pad Thai; which to me is really just boring filler, but their pad Thai was actually very impressive.    Also, do yourself a favor and order the Thai iced green tea.  It's incredible.    All in all; this place is amazing. Needless to say, I'll be back soon",

There were a couple people waiting for take out orders and then the phones were pretty busy with orders.  There were 3 ladies working the front with no obvious plan on who was handling what.  There was no hostess so no one greeted anyone and the 3 ladies were on the phone, ringing orders and bringing out the orders.  No one seemed to be working the dining room. All three tables got drinks and then we all sat watching and waiting for our orders to be taken.   15 minutes and nobody working the dining room.  We listened to the to go orders all being told it was at least a 50 minute wait.  One table went to the kitchen to get someone and their order was taken but I noticed it was not rung in bc the lady started taking walk in orders.  Still no one took our or the other tables order.  Complete Chaos.  We ended up leaving after about 20-25 minutes of sitting with drinks and waiting for someone to take our order.  I think they should close the dining room bc they seriously can't seem to juggle the take out orders with customers dining in. We live close by so I had hoped for a better visit than last time but I think we will be skipping this place in the future.",

The Thai Tea that I did receive tasted sour as well, like the cream that they mix in it had gone bad. When I have ordered from this place before, I usually pick up instead of having it delivered. I recommend picking up your order or eating at the restaurant just in case of restaurant errors. I'm pretty disappointed in my order this time.",

    "text": "Ugh I hate being *that* person...but the food was extremely lackluster the last few times I've been here.  I've been here several times ever since they opened. In the last year or so, my visits have been spaced out even farther because the food quality has dipped. I have zero clue why this place has shining reviews. Even when they first opened, I thought they were just westernized thai food. But it was decent enough for me to keep coming back. My thai aunties said it was pretty bad, but I really don't care about how \"authentic\" a place is if it just tastes good.  I was just okay with the food the last few times but I didn't think it was a huge deal enough to make a review. It was mediocre, but not bad. After my boyfriend suggested it, we decided to go and see if it got any better...it's been much worse. We went on a weeknight so not that busy.  Boyfriend got the Pad see-ew with a spice level of 7. His dish barely tasted spicy. I took a few bites and there was little to no kick to it. In fact, it was probably a 1/10 on spice.   My green curry came out and was extremely thin. I'm talking very, very thin, *watery* green liquid. No substance. The flavor was just not there but it was overly spiced to the point you couldn't taste. I felt turned off from how unappetizing it looked. My chicken was tender but the curry covering it was a mess of over nuked spice. I like and can definitely handle spicy, but this was just inedible for the flavor alone.   Service is okay and they try to be attentive but every visit I've noticed that they always seem rushed/busy because of take-out. They are polite, yet very rushed no matter the time of day.  I don't like the restaurant redoing a dish though. I've gave them enough tries to see if the food got any better, but I'm not recommending this place to anyone especially my Asian relatives/friends =[ Maybe I'd be happier with a safer dish like fried rice.  I'm all for the shiny reviews, because maybe others believe it's actually good for North Las Vegas lol. I really wanted to keep liking it, but sadly the food isn't enough for me to come back.",

One of the food peppers from the old Country making potstickers or egg rolls. Everything seemed totally normal.   She's doing everything right from wiping down her countertop with her dirty gray rag to dropping her wonton wrapper skins on the floor and then quickly adhering to the three second rule picking them back up off the dirty floor and putting them right back on the countertop so she may proceed making her delightful delicacies!  It was nice while it lasted amazing Thai! Unfortunately, I will have to Move On now.",

All the other Asian restaurants on the north side all have similar tasting food whether it's Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese etc. Amazing Thai bucks this trend.   I have eaten in the restaurant once and had delivery twice and the food has always exceeded my expectations.  My favorites so far are the Singapore noodles,  Mongolian beef, any of the house fried rice and the chicken satay finger appetizer. I will update this as I try more menu items. What I like about all the food that is common at most Asian restaurants here, is that Amazing Thai's take on them is unique and delicious.    The only time I ate at the restaurant was a good experience.  It was a Tuesday evening so it wasn't very busy.  We had multiple employees come to our table to check on us, and all were very friendly.  The dining area isn't fancy but it was clean and had a decent amount of seating.    Both times I had delivery service were good experiences as well.  The prices are competitive, delivery was quick and the food was still hot. I highly recommend this place and will be going back.",

When we were seated by the waitress and handed with the menu, I asked for the Lunch Special Menu and was told they were not serving that because it was Valentine's Day and that they were serving much more special food; so with that being said; we ordered the a la carte from the menu.  When the food came out, the half a duck tasted old & too dry!..we could tell by its look! ..looked like it came out from the  freezer - straight to the fryer, used old cooking oil. Thus, the deep-fried egg rolls were not fresh either- slightly burnt, again; deep-fried in old cooking oil. I also ordered chicken pad thai - i told the waitress to add just a little sweet seasoning in it, guess what?! ..too sweet! I had to reject it and asked to have it made-over, when it came back, it was too bland, no taste at all! It did not taste the way I usually have it. BTW, I used to buy my lunch here and always asked for chicken pad thai, the way I want it.  I asked for the Owner to come out, so I can let her know about the food and expressed my disappointment. I told her that I was unhappy with the food I got served. She apologized but she seemed perplexed by the look on her face, she was not understanding English well. The waitress was nice,  friendly, and empathetic with my experience. When I paid the bill, the owner took the duck off my bill, but still... I will never come back to dine-in here anymore!..so, that was their  Special for the occassion, Valentine's Day...yuck!!!!",

Luckily I found this place that was about 6 mins away from me. I fell in LOVE with their pad Thai! I don't know what it is, but thejr pad Thai had more flavor than the one at Archi's (in Summerlin).  I usually take mine to go. I have yet to dine in, but the service has been great every time I pick up my food.  My friend tried their mango sticky rice and said it was really good. The presentation of it looked amazing too.  There is a lot more I would like to try, but it's so hard when I'm always craving their pad Thai lol.  I would definitely recommend this place!",

The prices I think are perfect, very inexpensive and you get A LOT of food.  The orange chicken is flavored perfectly and I'm actually extremely impressed with the quality of meat. It's all white meat, cooked perfectly and breaded perfectly.  The drunken noodles with chicken is SO delicious. I get it at spicy level 3 which definitely has a kick at that low level but it's tolerable and doesn't leave your mouth on fire. The sauce is amazing and the chicken there is always cooked well too.  I will definitely continue to order from here and support this place. Good people and good food.",

The service was attentive and the food came out very quickly.  We started with Crab Rangoon and Thai Jerky, both were very fresh and tasty.  Next we had Crispy Duck, Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and Combo Fried Rice.  All were delicious and when I asked for a \"10\" spice level on the curry, it was actually hot.  My wife really enjoyed the Crispy Duck, it was excellent.  Overall: outstanding!",

Last time I decided to try the fried rice, it was very different than your traditional fried rice, though still delicious, there was no veggies and you could taste strong garlic. The portion sizes are pretty big.  As for Service very very SLOW. The first time we went in they didn't bring us our check. We had to go to the counter and ask for it.  Both times after that we always ask for the check ahead of time.",

We arrived at 7:30 pm so there wasn't many people there so the service was quick.  We ordered the Pad Thai, Teriyaki Chicken, Orange Chicken, French Fries for the kids, soft drinks, and Asahi beer for the adult.  Obviously, it has a variety of plates including those not so well associated with the traditional Thai menu which makes it great for everyone in the group.  Pad Thai was a little sweeter then normally what I have tasted, but still good.  The Orange Chicken was delicious as well with 4 slices of orange on each corner of the dish.  The Teriyaki Chicken comes in long slices on top of a bed of vegetables.  The veggies were sweet as well.  The fries were garnished with sprinkle of parsley with a cup of ranch dressing.    Overall, good and simple atmosphere.  Dress code is definitely very casual which is nice.  I would recommend this location.",

My son and I have dined in several times and have never been disappointed. It is typically very empty in the restaurant, but the times that we were the, the was a lot of takeout and delivery orders so maybe that's where a majority of their business comes from?  The food is always perfectly spiced and delicous. My son's favorite dish, and he is quite a picky eater, is the chicken pad see ew. Their house friend rice is very good, but their salmon panang curry is AMAZING!! I always ask for the skim on my salmon to be extra crispy, and they alway oblige.  The only reason it gets a four is because when we dined in, the dining room was almost completely empty and the service was painfully slow. The food however, is always delicious. If you like Thai food and live on the NW side of the valley, this spot is a winner.",

First experience:  When taking my order, the server asked what level of spice I'd like from 1-10. (I usually go to Sun's Thai Restaurant & their scale is also 1-10, but 3 being medium since Thai Spice is very spicy.) So I asked our server at Amazing Thai, what medium would rank on their 1-10 scale & he answered with such sass \"It's a scale of 1-10, the middle number 5\". I ignored his attitude, just didn't pay mind. But his service was horrible. He was behind the counter talking most of the time and got upset when I asked for a water refill. Just horrible service.  The second time I went, I decided to give it another shot since my sister has never gone & I got a sweet lady. She was very persistent & friendly.  Restaurant ratings are of two things for me 1. Quality of food 2. Service  So if you want good food, I would definitely try this out. But make sure you get a good server because bad service can always mess up your experience. Luckily, I gave it a second try",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this place ever since it opened and I wasn't disappointed! My dad ordered the Ultimate Fusion Salad while I got the crispy garlic tofu stir fry.   The salad was so good, my dad wanted it spicier but I thought it was perfect: nicely sweet and spicy. When you order the salad, they ask how spicy on a scale from 1-10 so I suppose you can straight up order the 10 if you want heat. We got a 7 and to me, it wasn't terribly spicy but I thought it was delicious.   The crispy garlic tofu stir fry was aight to me. It didn't hit my taste buds like BAM but it was really pretty. In general, all the food was beautifully presented.  What sold me was the seasonal mango beach ice cream. It had a subtle sweetness and the sticky rice was so great with the coconut milk, not to mention perfect ripe mango on top! I'll definitely come back here just for this sometime XD   Thank you Amazing Thai! I left happy",

When I walked in to pick up my food there were absolutely no customers. A person called on the phone and ordered a lot more than me (I eavesdropped) he told her 15 minutes.

The matcha in the tea was a little strong for my liking but I finished it and got a thai tea to replace it. Last but not least we ended our meal with the Mango Beach Ice Cream. The food and dessert was good, however, the customer service was lacking until a sweet lady took over our waitresses table.

The first time I ordered food from here they charged my card on another order and just said I will refund it back to your card, not even a sorry. Just now I ordered food at 6:22pm got to the restruant at 6:40pm and told the lady my name 3 times because she couldn't find it as well as told her exactly what I ordered and she went over to the 2 packages of take out and told me \"it is almost done\" if I could wait, which I did wait. By 7:11pm the same lady tells me I don't see your order are you sure you put it in? After she just told me they were \"almost done cooking it\" she goes back over to the table of packages and goes \"here it is\" (that package was sitting there the whole time I was waiting) I told the lady that was sitting there since I got here and you checked it and said it wasn't my order. Instead of apologizing the lady argues with me stating no it just got here. A man claiming to be the owner comes out and says that it said your pick up time was 6:48pm and I responded yet I was here and it was sitting there the whole time and now it's 7:11pm. The man says well it says 6:48pm so what is the problem? The problem was I waited here the whole time and my food was right there and instead of apologizing you are telling me there is no problem. The man asks me well what do you want and I responded the least you could do for wasting both of our time is take care of half of the bill which was $15. The so called owner tells me NO I cant do that I would loose money. (Still has not apologized) continues to argue with me about no he will loose money and I can just leave. Horrible customer service!!! They made me wait 30 min when my food was sitting in front of me the whole time and goes on to blame me and not once apologizing! Trust me you do not want to do business with this restruant!",

The crab rangoons were beautiful (flower shaped) but would have benefitted from more crab (just charge more for them). I got the chicken pad see ew and it was okay, good caramelization and white chicken. However, it was kind of bland and dry. Most pad see ew I have eaten includes at least a little soy/garlic sauce, this didn't have any.   The pineapple fried rice was rated \"it's ok. Not great, not terrible\" by the boyfriend. So...sort of bland as well.   So kudos Amazing Thai for the fast delivery, foil prepared containers and decent prices. However, we will stick with Nittaya's Secret Kitchen for top notch, flavorful Thai food.",

The beautiful gold tree painted on the walls really caught my eye. The waitress was very pleasant and attentive to our 5 year old daughter. The food was delicious as well. A bit of a wait but then again that just tells me everything is cooked to order. We ordered the pineapple fried rice without the shrimp.  Huge portions two people can totally eat from one order.  We also had the chicken wings, my husband looooved it. The Thai iced tea was super refreshing and tasty. Lastly we ordered the sweet sticky rice with coconut ice cream, to die for! It's more of a soupy consistency because they add coconut milk to the rice but i didnt mind this at all. Would definitely return. Price point is a little on the higher side rice order was $11 but now that I know you get enough to feed two I would order one order instead of two.",

Came here for the first time, the distance to and from my place is very convenient.   We decided to order a ton of to-go and we were all very impressed. The customer service, VERY kind and sweet. The chef looked like a man you can trust cooking your food, LEGIT .. The food was not oily which is a plus & a must, ingredients tasted fresh and deliciously made..   Only reason why this wasn't a 5 (dont mean to be a buzz kill) is because the portions weren't quite what we hoped for. We ordered so many and opened it up, not as generous as I hoped it would be. Although we ended up fulfilled nonetheless.   I could definitely see myself going there again for sure.  Kudos Amazing Thai! Thank you for your hospitality and Amazing Thai food..",

Great, no problem. I got there 25 min later to pick up my order thinking it should be ready; it's been over the 20min they had promised. WRONG! I get there and pay for my food, then the lady in the front says \"have a seat.\" So I go sit down to wait for my food. 15 min later, still no food. I ask the lady how much longer it is going to take for my food to be ready and all I got for a response was, \"oh.\" Then she proceeded to walk away and never came back to give me an answer. I continue to wait. 15 min later I FINALLY get my food...almost an HOUR (55min to be exact) after I had originally placed my order! No explanation either as to what took so long. Don't get me wrong, I get places get busy but I watched dine-in customers come and go before I got my order! There were maybe 4 tables occupied at the time, so they were by no means full.  Amazing Thai...if you know you're busy and are going to take forever to fulfill an order, please let the customer know that! Also, maybe consider keeping your customers informed on delays and not blatantly ignoring them.",

Didn't give it a 5 star because the delivery guy forgot my Thai Tea, he did bring it back within 5 minutes and I didn't get any forks or napkins.  When ordering off the menu the ingredients aren't accurate.  First I ordered the Cucumber Salad on the menu it says it came with cucumbers,  red onion, their special Thai dressing.  I got a salad with much more,  it also contained red and green peppers, nuts,  tomatoes and lots of cilantro (which I love). The salad was awesome, flavorful-lots of color.  But add ALL the items that's added into the salad.  It would have been easier for others to choose, and please keep the salads consistent.  The next time I order that salad I'm going to expect the same. One more thing I ordered the fried chicken wings,  they were fresh and Taste good however they were on a bed of jalapenos, didn't like that,  the whole point was to NOT have spicy wings.  Next I'll try the Pad Thai hope they add lots of cilantro.",

It's either they add more to the serving portion or lower the price for the same size. That way... they can claim their name \"amazing thai\" with good food, generous portion and reasonable price.",

So last night my wife got her food and mine was still getting prepared. So instead of letting her food get cold she ate while I sat there and watched her as I was waiting for my food. By the time my food got to the table she was done eating. Now it was my turn to eat and her turn to watch me eat my meal.  So here's an idea for the cooks when it comes to food prep timing. We have two entrees. Item A takes 15 minutes to prepare. Item B takes 8 minutes to prepare. You begin preparing item A first. Seven minutes later you begin preparing item B. Both items finish at the same time. Now your customers can enjoy their meals together instead of individually. Does it make any sense to begin preparing both meals at the same time? Bottom line if you go there by yourself you're good. If you go there to eat with someone else, each of you will be eating alone.",

There seemed to be a constant stream of to-go orders so the waitstaff was a little slow to help us. Once we ordered we decided on the beef jerky, roasted duck and the spicy basil fried rice (at level 5 spice).   It took quite awhile to get the food to us and it came out in waves (jerky then rice then finally the duck) which wasn't surprising as the duck takes awhile to cook. Everything was flavored really well - the beef jerky was amazing, the rice was spicy even for a level 5 (hence the name, hah) but the duck was a little dry (needed a good about of sauce to make it enjoyable)  I have a feeling that to-go will be a better option from now on but i'll definitely be returning.",

The Tom Kha soup wasn't terrible considering it's hard to find a decent Tom kha soup, & my chow mein was ok but again, the noodles were hard. We were so hungry we just ate our noodles & threw out the rest. And last but not least, the $10 delivery charge is RI-DIC-U-LOUS, laughable actually. I would have NO problem tipping a delivery driver MORE than $10 if the food is good, but when the food is mediocre at best & we only live a mile away, that is just a tad extreme.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place because of all the 4 and 5-star reviews and it's close to home.   We got here for dinner and the place was empty. Not even an employee was in sight. We heard banging and clanking in the kitchen so, they got to be open. We were saying \"hello?\" to get somebody's attention but nope. We were ready to leave when finally, the hostess/server came out.  We tried a few items on the menu. I was happy that they have refills on their Thai iced tea! That's probably the only thing I liked about this place.  Basil in Egg Cup: Fried hard boiled egg white with chicken satay. The chicken was sweet and pretty weird. 2/5  Beef Salad: This was pretty tasty. But it was spicier than it should be. 2/5  Tom Yum: I had chicken added. Their spicy level is from 1-10. I asked for a 6 but it tasted like an 8. I burnt my taste buds and my stomach. 1/5  Tom Kar: Basically, Tom Yum with coconut milk. Same issue here: burnt taste buds and stomach ache. 1/5  I was disappointed and was in pain. I think I'd rather drive a few more miles to get some good Thai food. I was not amazed.",

The mango sticky rice was passable as the rice seems a bit underdone and swimming in a pool of tasty coconut sauce instead of the coconut cream. Food came timely, attentive water refill.  It is an easy to miss place because of its placement in the Albertsons center.  A great place for lunch, good value and a nice change of pace from pizzas and burgers. The Thai ice tea was a nice refill at no charge.",

    "text": "Alleluia!   Amazing Thai Restaurant has arrived in our neighborhood in North Las Vegas and I couldn't be happier.  We don't exactly have a plethora of good food options near us here, but things are slowly turning around.  Amazing!   We came here for Saturday lunch and the items we ordered were:  Chicken Satay Finger- Ordered off the Fusion Appetizer section, my son called these chicken tenders!  I guess so, but better.  Marinated in Thai style marinated and then fried, they are served with house peanut sauce.  We enjoyed them.  Fried Won Ton:  my son's choice.  Nothing too special about them, but not everything has to be extraordinary, just satisfying.  Thumbs up from him.  Pad See Eiw (side note: I've seen so many spellings of this dish.  Which one is correct?  This is their spelling) - my son's girlfriend orders this at every Thai restaurant and she loved it.  Spicy Basil Fried Rice- kiddo's order at the spiciest level of 10.  I tasted it, but it was way too spicy for this wimp (me), but he also liked it.  Pad Thai Shrimp- my order and I only ate half because I was already getting full because of the chicken fingers and I wanted to leave room for dessert.  Good dish that I can enjoy again as leftovers.  Volcano Ice Cream- vanilla ice cream with raspberry and caramel sauces over chocolate rock.  This was a fun dessert to look at and tasty to eat.    Service was excellent throughout our meal and I foresee us returning since it's close and since it's good. Going back soon to try the Mango and Sticky Rice!",

They serve very authentic style food and presentation is appealing. My favorite order off the menu is the \"Tom yum soup\" #3 spice & \"papaya salad\". The other entrees we had was the chicken satay and sweet chili fried rice was great too.   Food portion can feed up to 2-3 people on what we ordered. Want to come back and try their dessert like the mango sticky rice and other items off their menu. Will recommend to friends and family to come here. Customer service was very helpful always checking up on us. Awesome atmosphere and vibes.   Tip: Go lightly on the spice level Becuase a #3 was pretty hot for us already for the soup.",

Seem like it was like rubber or fake chicken not sure how to explain it. The prentasaion if the plate was good but one thing they had sauce on the side which I don't know what it was. Sorry to say I been to lots of Thai places in USA and I have to give this one a 2 star. One thing I like was free thai ice tea refills can't find that in other places in Vegas or us. But I just tried red curry.  There's other places that are good in North Las Vegas or in Vegas period. Also took a long time to get my bill keep on looking at them. Didn't care if I was here.",

    "text": "This restaurant should have \"Notso\" added to their restaurant name.  We went for dinner and ordered hot green tea, the Salt & Pepper chicken wings appetizer, then Tom Yum Kung (\"shrimp\" for the farangs LOL) and Crab Fried Rice.  Here's the \"play by play\":  1) Hot Green Tea--$3 an order is a big markup for basically hot water and a tea bag.   2) Salt & Pepper wings were really good and served hot.  We thought this was a good omen and couldn't wait until the next entrees.  On a down side however, the appetizer was served without any accompanying plates for us to eat on which forced us to eat over our napkins and the table top.  We couldn't wait for the busy waitresses to come around to request plates because we were hungry. 3) Tom Yum Kung (shrimp)--bland, served lukewarm, and although we received cups to eat soup out of, we didn't get spoons to eat with (only forks on the table setting).  I couldn't taste any lemon grass, galangal, or lime juice in the broth.  The soup was watery as if they were stretching the last bit of soup before closing for the night.  The amount of shrimp was good but the soup only had some floating button mushrooms without much cilantro or tomatoes. 4) Crab Fried Rice--served lukewarm, and the rice was dry (in clumps) with hardly any crab or scrambled egg in it.  It was mostly stale rice with soy sauce in it.  An uninspired fried rice dish--very disappointing.    The main problem that we could see is there was only two waitresses and they seemed overwhelmed and not familiar with restaurant operations.  I couldn't see what was going on in the kitchen but the fact our food was not piping hot may indicate the dishes were ready for serving but the waitresses couldn't pick the dishes up and they sat around cooling down.    It's too bad this restaurant didn't deliver a good Thai food experience in this part of town.  I like Siam Garden (LV Blvd) and Lotus of Siam (Sahara) in Las Vegas for Thai food.  Pin Kaow is pretty good but I tell them to not make their dishes so sweet as I prefer savory over sweetness.",

Price increase by itself is not an issue, but when service quality drops and food quality drops, there is an issue.   We ordered:  Crab Fried Rice - tasty, but the rice is slightly hard. Dish is also quite oily. Rated a B. Shrimp Pad Woon Seen - again it is very oily. Rated a B-. Tofu Panang Curry - Taste is strange. Only 6 or 7 pcs of small Tofu cube. Rated a C-.  What was really wrong was that after we ordered, it took them 10 minutes to send out our Crab Fried Rice. And the other two dishes took another 15 minutes to arrive. Food is sitting at the kitchen counter too long??  For me, this is no longer that same restaurant that we used to visit. I am very reluctant to revisit this place. My dinner dollars can be better spent elsewhere.",

I honestly was nervous about the food because we had ordered late and I didn't know if we where going to get good quality because of it but I was surprised how much detail was added into our order. Everything was packed individually, our order was in double bags and the presentation was amazing.  They even labeled everything for us which I thought was so nice of them to do.  When we opened up all the food it was all still nice and hot.  We ordered egg rolls,  Crispy duck fried rice,  Tokyo Curry and Tom yum noodle soup. The portion size of everything was great.  We ordered for 2, but we feel as though we have left overs for 2 more days. Now it was our first time trying Thai food so we did not know what to expect. We loved the egg rolls and fried rice but we where surprised about the Tokyo curry.  The chicken and rice itself was good. But the curry tasted a bit sweet, we had ordered it mild.  Despite that my husband and I did enjoy the Tokyo curry. And the Tom Yum Soup was interesting we thought it was going to savory but it was more sweet.  Again we don't really know what Thai food is supposed to taste like and we don't have anything to compare it to.  But overall it was a good experience and I would definitely come back to try something new.",

I'm giving 2 stars for a decent Tom Kar soup and a great server (with curly blonde hair:) To start off, we had not one or two but THREE dirty dishes/utensils and even a dirty napkin at our table, so the first impression was not good. The service was not good either, except for the very hardworking lady who seemed to be handling the whole place even though there appeared to be other employees present(keep in mind this woman wasn't even our waitress but she offered the most attentive service in the whole place.) The food was okay but far too artificially sweet for me. The Pad Thai sauce is a very bright orange which is to me is not traditional Thai. I did enjoy the Tom Kar even though it too was overly sweet. I would MAYBE, go back for the soup but I also have reason to question the cleanliness of the place and food and that makes me want skip it all together. I really hope that more quality places come to the area, we certainly could use them.",

    "text": "Ordered from EAT24 will never order from them again. The food I ordered was the crab fried rice, which was $11. and change. The moment I opened the bag I knew I had made a mistake when I was hit with an overwhelming smell of ammonia! I hadn't even opened the food container yet! The moment I opened the container my suspicions were confirmed, the crab was bad and had turned bad!!! I was angry and called the restaurant, they all acted like they didn't understand what I was saying and nobody spoke English! I called the health department on this place. I placed some in a zip-lock bag and placed it into the freezer, the Clark County Health Department sent someone out to pick it up that very day. 02/14/2016",

    "text": "We have visited twice. The Panang Curry and the Pineapple Rice were amazing both times. The Phad See Ew with chicken was way better the first time. Called in the order and I appreciate they told me it would be about 40min. I don't mind waiting if the food is going to be done right! Customer service was great! They are new and working out the kinks, if you've ever owned a restaurant you know how it is, others on here obviously don't! Will definitely be back soon!!!",
