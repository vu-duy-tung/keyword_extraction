I was so excited about the new Sushi place and I think I will even give it one more chance.   Both times my order was incomplete so I had to keep asking for the same thing. It gets more irritating when they forget it again. It might be that they were very busy but this would never happen at Sushi Koma on the south side of Vegas or Sushi goyemon, probably one of the busiest AYCE sushi joint in town.   The biggest thing though, and this is serious, the fish quality has been very inconsistent. The scallop tastes very dried and the salmon is sometimes hard to digest. What offended me during one of my last twos visits was that the salmon came with whole bunch fish bones in it. This is unacceptable in a sushi restaurant. Also, the sushi rice kept on falling apart and the rice tasted very dried and blend. While I do not expect a 5 star sushi experience at a AYCE place, I do expect the basics are met. Having bones appear in your sushi is just embarrassing imo.   I really love the people here and sasa was really good when i first tried it. I am willing to give it another chance and i hope things will get back to what they were used to be.",

I guess the wait for the appetizers was fine, because they were tasty.  We became very displeased however, after placing our sushi order--which we were very excited to taste from the apparently wonderful selection of items on the menu--and waited half an hour for our order to arrive, only to find out that the order had never been properly communicated or processed.  They apologized and try to place our order, but by that time it was too late as I had an appointment scheduled half an hour later.  Suffice to say, we left without finishing our meal.  I feel like I wasted an hour of my life at this establishment.  Disappointing to say the least.",

I have to say that the other time I was here, I was really disappointed with the service. The salmon belly that I had was really warm and it smelled really fishy.. And then the server that we had took forever just give us chopsticks and our water.   BUT I wanted to give this place another chance last night because of how really amazing they've treated me in the past. I'm glad I did! Delia was there last night as well as Laci and Nick! And it felt like home all over again. It felt like at that very moment it's where I belong, and I fell in love with it all over again.   I got my usual salmon belly nigiri (still delicious), white tuna nigiri (so good!), calamari, poke salad, baked green mussels, shrimp tempura, & a delicious special roll that they've made with my favorite salmon belly! Everything was delicious and so fulfilling as usual! You can ALWAYS customize your order to the way you want it here. So if you want more or less cream cheese on your baked green mussel, then they'll add it in. Don't be afraid to ask because they love to make their customers happy here, plus they're really nice!   Definitely going back here soon! :) Maybe even in the next few weeks!   P.S. Children 5 and under are free for AYCE!",

Service: Sat at the sushi bar and ordered AYCE sushi for their lunch price. I'd recommend sitting at the bar so you can ask the sushi chef questions and give precise orders. They're very creative and accommodating; he gave us plates that we didn't order and all were pretty good! I made a custom order and he was able to make it for me, no problem. :)",

For all-you can eat menu, it's much less than other similar venues that offer a bigger menu and better quality.  The real trick here is assuming you have steady service throughout your meal.  Here however, they like to disappear for long periods of time.  Seems convenient for an all you can eat option that they want to slow your ordering.  I'd say this was just coincidence, but again second visit with the same service.  For $26 each, I expect to be able to order more off of your lesser menu.  My bad, but no worries, we won't be back.   We brought family here from out of town and had to apologize for our selection.  Lesson learned.  Mango Mochi at the end slightly improved the experience, but not enough to move out of the 2 star rating.  PS--Waiting on Check now for 20 mins without anyone approaching the table.  This place isn't busy right now.",

Couldn't go to our normal spots so had to find something close by. Yelped sushi places and this one came up. Reviews and pictures looked good so we tried it. Restaurant is at the corner backend of a shopping plaza so curb appeal is not the best but we still proceeded inside. No one was in the restaurant so they said pick anywhere to sit. Sat down and we were immediately asked for what we wanted. No customer service whatsoever. We decided to just do a few rolls since we didn't know the place well and didn't want to do \"all you can eat\". Ordered and food came out very quick. I would recommend the Mexican roll, so good. I took a picture of it and the Cali Royale. Other then that nothing was great. The edamame was soggy and seemed like it was steamed a few too many times over and over again. The tiger roll, not on their menu but they can make it was so gross. The spicy tuna was mushy paste like, definitely did not have a good taste to it.   I would come back only if we were stuck on this side of town like we were when we came here and only do those 2 rolls that I mentioned.",

The price is reasonable ($25 all you can eat)  The mochi ice cream is cheap and decent.  Cons:   They need to fix their booths. The booth we sat in has a hole.  The rolls weren't very impressive. The rice was dry and sticky.   When I asked for spicy mayo (one for myself and another for my boyfriend-mind you they were small containers) the cook (based off the pictures he wasn't the usual cook) told the waitress \"I only have this bottle.\" (Rude much! You shouldn't be addressing the waitress or customer like that. Plus I'm pretty sure if you have a sushi restaurant you should have more spicy mayo in the back.)  I also disliked the menu. When you order all you can eat they don't give you a sheet (like most sushi spots do) to make it easier to order.   I'm not sure why this place has 4 stars.",

    "text": "So, this place was highly-rated so we went here after realizing that about 5 of the 5-star reviews were from what seem to be fake accounts (1-3 reviews, no profile pic). Although the service was pretty good (it better be since there was hardly anybody there), the food wasn't 4 or 5-star quality. Filipinos run this place (not that that really matters). $22/person for AYCE.  We ordered edamame, calamari, a bunch of rolls and nigiri, and dessert.  Tracy II: Salmon, avocado, jalapeno topped with salmon, lemon and sriracha. 3/5  Mountain:  Shrimp tempura and crab salad topped with  salmon, tuna, yellowtail and snapper with eel sauce. 2/5  Sasa: Shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp, cream cheese topped with salmon, toasted mayo eel sauce and sriracha. 4/5  Pain in the Ass: Salmon, tuna, avocado and cream cheese...deep-fried and drizzled with wasabi mayo. For some reason, it tasted like banana. 3/5  Nigiri: We had salmon (the cuts were good but slightly thin), tuna (we were given the worst cuts - end pieces that looked like several slices put together on top of rice), hamachi 2/5  Handrolls: Soft shell crab was good. Salmon skin was too meaty and was not crispy at all, the juices from it were dripping. Presentation was great. 3/5  Calamari: Lightly breaded and seasoned. Peppery has a light sauce at the bottom. Tasty...we ordered 2. 4/5  Strawberry Mochi and Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream: Mochi and ice cream are pre-made and store-bought items but the green tea ice cream they used tasted like medicine. 2/5  The server told me they have sashimi, uni and amaebi for dinner AYCE. Good to know but I'll probably go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Sasa Sushi's AYCE option really filled me up for $21 (lunch price). A bargain when compared to some AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.   Here's an overview of their AYCE: There's a 45 minute time limit for lunch; 1 hour for dinner, I believe. AYCE menu options are decent. Plenty of rolls and hot food items. Excluding deep fried rolls, you can order 1/2 rolls.  FOOD Pain in the Ass Roll:  The name did make me laugh out loud, so I had to order. I do like this roll, but I thought there was *too* much sauce on my plate.  Masago and Tako Nigiri: The masago was meager and not \"robust\" as others I've had. I do like how you can request quail eggs to top. The tako was too chewy and the rice vinegar for the sushi rice was strong, so I didn't enjoy the flavor-texture combination.  Japanese Lasagna: I thought there was too much cheese. It's difficult for me to figure out if there was too much cheese in the rolls or on top -- both, maybe? But being a cheese lover, even that was excessive.  Unnamed Roll: The sushi chef created two pieces of sushi for us on the fly. The pieces had imitation crab on top of rice and were wrapped with a thin slice of tuna, which kind of reminded me of bacon. Not bad, we enjoyed it.  SC 7 Roll: The roll is wrapped with soy paper and has drops of srirracha sauce on top. I thought I would like this roll, but the flavors didn't meld well. As much as I love srirracha, I thought it was what threw the flavors off-balance.   Tempura Ice Cream: Tempura battered vanilla ice cream served with chocolate syrup and a spray of whipped cream. Didn't care for the texture of the thick tempura shell. I also thought this was underwhelming when compared to the tempura ice cream that RA sushi has, which is the best one I've had so far in Las Vegas.   SERVICE The service here is terrific. Staff is friendly, competent, and attentive.   OTHER Sushi that isn't tightly rolled = contents will fall out.   Maybe I'm just being picky, but one of the rolls ordered wasn't arranged neatly. I bring this up because I've before never seen sushi rolls presented sloppily. It reminds me of what my plate looks like when I hit up a sushi buffet and grab sushi pieces and plop them onto my plate.   OVERALL My rating for Sushi Sasa  is a 3.5/5.0. The service is wonderful and the price for the AYCE lunch is awesome. The rolls are fine, but I wouldn't order the same items again.",

I did the all you can eat and after about 15 minutes nick ignored me. The place was busy but the guy next to me doing all you can eat was getting service. I deliberately waited for him to ask me whats next and he completely ignored me. With so many competing all you can eat sushi places around, this place won't be missed by me.  **plus every time I go there there is always shit flies flying around. You know the flies that you see around dog shit on the street. One time I went, there was a problem with so many bugs by the cooler that the sushi chefs were scared to go next to the cooler.**   Im actually going to call the health department thanks to Nick's service today.",

All the staff were extremely friendly including the manager (who is insanely tall btw). The chefs that work at the bar are the absolute best though. From working in kitchens at several restaurants I can tell when people work well together and these guys definitely had some flow.   I had the AYCE sushi buffet. The sushi was great and I like that they had pork belly on the appetizer menu which was delicious. My favorite thing that I had was the 10k roll which isn't on the menu but one of the chefs own creation.   Overall 5 stars for great friendly and timely service as well as great food! I will definitely be back again!",

We had a hard time deciding if we wanted to do AYCE or just go with regular rolls. In the end all three of us got AYCE it was decent Sushi but nothing EPIC which is why I gave a 4 star rating. We received really good service and my favorite roll of the night was the BIG CAJUN ROLL. The other thing I really loved was the Tempura Fried Icecream. I got green tea and since it was my birthday they brought it out with a candle and even sang to me. It was a Awesome experience. Just so you know too they are happy to make custom rolls.  The Sushi Chefs are really nice and did a bunch of custom things for my picky friends! It isn't the BEST Sushi in town but it was really friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back again.",

Every time we eat here we leave a note or drawing (sometimes both!) to the owners/managers(?) and they love getting them. My girlfriend brought her own Stevia sugar packet one day when we went out to eat here and then a few days after, we decided to stop by and get dinner, our server pointed out that they had new sugar and their new sugar was 'Stevia in the Raw' I thought that was really thoughtful of them! Major kudos to you guys!  If you're looking for a slightly cheaper AYCE place, with friendly staff and amazing food, you should check this place out! We made this our favorite AYCE spot! :D",

They know exactly what we like & don't like & most of the time, will have already prepared our orders before we tell them what we want. They are fantastic! If anyone ever asks me for a recommendation, I ALWAYS refer them here.   The only reason I am not giving Sasa a full 5-star review is because of the wait staff (especially Erin in particular). In the year & a half we have been dining here, I have never once seen him smile. He walks up to customers with a very sour expression & a clear vibe of disinterest. He never comes to refill you drinks, unless you flag him down (I have actually walked my cup up to him before & asked for a refill), he never remembers to bring us lemons for our water, he slides/slams our plates down in front of us, never says excuse me, & constantly complains about everything. My boyfriend & I have said to the other staff, more than once, \"if he is so unhappy, why hasn't he just quit already?!\"  Other than his bad attitude, this place is the best. You can't beat the AYCE prices, the atmosphere & the delicious fish! My love for this place is far greater than my hatred for the poor server.",

    "text": "My go to place for AYCE sushi. I've eaten at a lot of AYCE places in my day, so that says a lot.  Pros:  1. The first and most important thing is the quality of the fish. With one exception where there was a bad batch of mackeral (which the chefs and I now have a running joke about now), I've never once been disappointed with the fish I've been served. Always fresh, always generously portioned, never over temperature or dry. Fish to rice ratio is also always right on point.   2. The staff are great, especially the chefs. If you sit at the bar, they're always on point with getting you taken care of, and are a really fun bunch to have conversations with while you eat. Manny is a rock star. Seen the owner a handful of times and she's very nice.  3. Their AYCE pricing is fairly standard, but the real deal comes from the AYCD bonus for only $5 extra. Even without it, the house sake is super cheap at $1.50 for a small and $3.00 for a large. Most place charge double or triple that. They also have a nice, fairly priced selection of cold and bottled sakes as well.  4. The place is clean and doesn't smell funky. There's a lot of sushi places where you walk out smelling like an abandoned fish factory, but not here. Never had a dirty table. Bathrooms are well maintained. And, most importantly, to my knowledge they have never once had a health department grade lower than A. That's a huge deal in this town.  5. They have shiso. This isn't something you'll commonly see in reviews, and most people don't even know what that is, but that's a big deal for me. Also known as perilla, its plant leaf that really enhances the flavors for certain nigiri items, especially squid and yellowtail. They even have a really rocking appetizer called Japanese Nachos that has deep fried shiso with a lovely fish mix on top of it. One of my favorite things there.   More often than not, if I ask for this at other places, they either don't have it, charge extra for it, or don't even know what it is (blasphemy!).  Cons:  1. Generally the appetizers aren't bad, but aren't great either. Some things like the calamari and popcorn scallops are overcooked, small, and rubbery. They get the job done, but could be improved. Selection for them is also a bit limited. A minor complaint though, as I'm there primarily for the sushi, and the Japanese Nachos as stated above make me more than happy enough to not really care appetizer wise.  2. Sometimes there will be a lot of reservations, so seating will be limited. Kind of a bummer when you're walking in on a Friday or Saturday night and there's a really long wait. Can't really knock them for it though, so this is more of just an FYI to call ahead on those nights to make sure there's seating available.  3. Minor quibble, but there's no menu options for riceless rolls (i.e. the ones that use cucumber instead of rice).  In summary, I'm happy to be a frequent customer here and will continue to be one for as long as they're around.",

Staff seemed to always be rushing around so although it was fairly packed its possible they were understaffed that night. We all ordered the pay one price meal. I ordered 2 to start. Cali rolls and tuna rolls. Friend ordered Cali roll and seaweed salad. One person ordered 2 items and guy next to me ordered 6 things. Three of us got our 2 things fast but mr. order everything only got 2 of his items. 15 minutes later he orders 3 more things and asked where his other 3 items were. This is how the night went. Hed order more and demand why his other stuff wasn't ready yet. I will say we all ordered the pork belly but by the time it came it was cold and rubbery. They apologized and refired. All in all I ordered 11 things and got 9. What I did get was tasty and fresh. Mr. Order the menu got louder and more rude every round of food. I left the place very full and enjoyed my dinner and will definately go back and without the rude, complaining loudmouth.",

    "text": "$25.95 AYCE and $5 AYCD is a phenomenal deal for the excellent food and service I received this evening!  The sushi melted in your mouth like butter. The special rolls tasted like a party in your mouth! The sides, like veggie tempura, pork belly and teri beef, were a nice compliment to the sushi and rolls. End the meal with a mango mochi ice cream - YUMM!  The service: everyone seemed to be our server. With that said, I never felt like I was waiting for my order or a drink. As soon as a dish was done, your empty plate was removed in less than a minute...WOW! This type of service should be adopted at other locations, as I'm sure many bad yelp reviews are caused by poor service.   SASA is located in an assuming place, so it's even more of a reason to check out this diamond in the ruff!",

    "text": "Quality of food is great, good options, and decent service.  Came here for a quick lunch with a few friends because one of them lives in the area. It is far from city center but for me it was worth the drive. The lunch price of $21.95 is very limited and does not have sweet shrimp or uni, so we paid extra for the dinner option at lunch just so we can get the specialty items. The specialty items were still only 1 order per person.   The sashimi plates were awesome! One of the very few places that does sashimi for all your can eat. The pieces were smaller, but still very fresh. The sushi were pretty good, rice size is about average. The rolls were ok, some hits and some misses. The free sake with Yelp check-in is great!!  Service was decent, bathrooms were clean. If I was in the area, I definitely would come back.",

    "text": "Went here on Sunday because Arata sushi was closed. Let me just say the service there was horrible. The food was decent, wasn't horrible but wasn't nearly as good as other places. They brought our sushi and ended up forgetting about the curry we ordered, we had to literally grab someone's attention to figure out what was taking so long for the curry. I had already finished my food long before they finally brought my boyfriend his curry, so we ended up asking for a to go box for it. We were handed the to go box with no comments or questions as to if we wanted to check out now or if we wanted anything else. Waited another 10 minutes before I decided to walk up and ask if we can check out, as the gentleman looked confused he said yes I can do it all right here if you want. They ended up charging me double for an item and when I brought it up they had to go verify with our waiter before agreeing to take it off. After taking it off the gentleman did apologize, but the service was absolutely terrible. I could understand if they were busy but there was only one other party in the restaurant and they had already been taken care of. Save yourself the time and money and go to Arata sushi literally a minute up the street from this place. Horrible service here.",

    "text": "It is very rare that I give a place a 1-star review, but given the circumstances, it must be done. Here is why..  1. We walked in asking for a table for 6 and the server immediately asked us \"Is this your first time here?\" We replied with \"Yes.\" You know, thinking she was going to be like \"Oh, welcome!! We're so happy to have you with us tonight!\" Instead, she responded with, \"Oh, next time, can you just make sure you call in to let us know that you have a big group coming in? As you can see we're quite small so it will just be better for both of us if you called in...\" Did I not just tell her that it was our first time? Was I supposed to know that you were a small restaurant? I thought this was like any typical restaurant that I can walk in with a party of 6 and you can accommodate us, even if it meant for us to wait a little? o_O?   2. I checked in on Yelp and received a free sake, and what's some sake without some Asahi amirite? So we order a bottle of Asahi. Almost regrettable because it completely confused the crap out of the server and had her asking her coworker if that was allowed multiple times. Back and forth she went asking questions and thinking we were looking for a free bottle of Asahi with our sake when we repeatedly told her we just wanted to order a beer with our sake..! Just take my money already and give us the bottle of Asahi!   3. The server continued to remind us she was new. The first time was a pass and understandable, but mistake after mistake after mistake and the excuse of being new does not fly with me. I give you the benefit of the doubt that you're a smart cookie, you don't have to keep telling me that you're new. I understood the first time. Just do better. And by better, I don't mean spilling water on our phones...which is exactly what she did -___-\" ohh laawwd.   4. The upside and downside is that if you wanted any roll wrapped with cucumber you can do so, but only ONE roll when you're doing the AYCE option. Bummer because those are the only type of rolls I fancy.   5. Obviously our server wasn't favorable but just in general I feel like the place is rather small where all servers are taking care of all tables. I personally like to have one attentive server when I dine because then you run into multiple servers asking you if you're doing okay in 5 minute rotations. But that wasn't the problem here, it just seemed like no one was being attentive. If possible, just dine at the sushi bar so you can get your orders in right away and not have to deal with that mess.  6. Lastly, the reason why I'm like EEK! Methinks not! about Sasa is because I don't live in this area and don't see myself driving 20 minutes to visit here again. The food was OK but the service is really what left the bad taste in my mouth.",

The staff may have seemed flustered since their credit card machine was down and they were only taking cash, though the restaurant was still crowded.

I'd suggest the owners/manager provide her some training in customer service.  She did not make us feel warm or welcome at Sasa.  We decided to stick it out and are glad we did.  The rest of the employees we encountered were fantastic.  The food itself was all very tasty and presented well.  I like that they don't cram everything with as much rice as possible.  All of the rolls were pretty good and there wasn't any food that we did not enjoy.  The desserts offered were pretty decent alsol  The ambiance was okay and it is clear they have a lot of regulars.  I think this place would do better if they made first timers feel welcome and perhaps talk up the place a little.  Maybe recommend some of the rolls that are unique to Sasa.  We almost walked out and said \"F-It\" after our encounter with the host during arrival.  I'm happy we stayed and may consider coming back.  I would gladly take a poor host and great food over a great host and poor food.",

Surprisingly this place has decent reviews so I'm sure this comment doesn't equate to much but no one wants subpar sushi and to deal with insults over one question.

Showed up at about 8:45 and by the time we were there, they claimed to have ran out of salmon skin rolls (they only told us after we waited about 15 minutes and asked about it) and different ice cream flavors. When we're paying the price for all you can eat, I would expect to get everything I wanted... especially when the menu doesn't have much to offer compared to all the other all you can eat sushi places. A couple other things too... one of the male waiters seemed a bit rude and we felt rushed when we were putting orders in and our waters were refilled only when we were sucking nothing but drips of water through the straws. We definitely won't be coming back here again. It's worth the drive going to our original sushi spot about 40 minutes away from home.",

I had no idea kids counted as adults when they hardly eat!!!   They just lost one of their most faithfull customers i never went anywhere else for sushi for 12 years even when they raised their prices i kept going back because of the service and the fresh food but as of my last visit i am looking for a new sushi bar where i will be treated better and with a bit more respect!!!",

The food taste is just average especially and nothing stands out, all their salads seem to have the Same seasoning. Still an ok place if you want to try out everything for a reasonable price.",

They won't give you the time of day.   I literally had to hunt the waiter down to give me a refill on my water. While he was there, he didn't even bother to refill my bf's empty cup of water. I guess he had to ask too.   As I was eating one of the rolls, I pulled out a huge fish bone... I accidentally swallowed one and right then and there I was done.   Not only did they neglect us, BUT the rice on the sushi was hard... NONE of the rolls were warm when they came to our table. I was pretty upset with our time here since I did find this place from yelp!",

Their poke salad though is definitely a MUST TRY. It is the best one I've had. It has a combination of tuna, yellowtail, and salmon along with some seaweed salad. Which is why I always get it whenever we come. Their mango crunch roll is also a good one to try if you're into the sweet and savory, the first time we went there, our waitress recommended it and I was skeptical at first because of the mango and cream cheese combo, but I was sold on it! It was actually very good. My boyfriend enjoyed their orange tiger roll a lot more though, so that's another one to try if you like sweetness.",

Came here New Year's eve CRAVING some bomb sushi and wanting to try somewhere new.. well what a good idea that was -_-  Upon walking in I already didn't have a good feeling because it smelt SO fishy! Any sushi eater knows fish aint supposed to smell like fish.. but I decided to give it a chance. We were sat down immediately and asked right away if we were ready to order... Um, maybe in like 2 min *big sarcastic smile*. Soooo like 10 min later we're just sittin' here and the 3 servers/hosts are chatting away at the host stand and I'm starin at em hoping to catch their eye and call them over. Well before that happens I can CLEARLY hear the guy say \"Um she won't stop staring at me, did you take their order\" with her responding \"They weren't ready!\" LADY... No, no I was not ready upon my immediate sit down.. So she walks over and says \"So are you ready now?\" Omg I could cut a b*tch... with a nice big smile I say.. Yes..I am ready. As she walks away the other servers begin to laugh their asses off as if we were being \"impatient\".. Oh my word.. and I don't want to get started on how shitty the sushi was.. Completely falling apart as I try to pick it up and SO damn fishy. GROSS.. I could vomit thinking about it. Anyways... yea, no. Never come here.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch to see sushi chef Manny, an old friend from Hawaii.  Unfortunately he was off, but we decided to stay for the ayce lunch anyway as this was our first time here and we wanted to try a new sushi place.  Upon entering, an employee in regular street clothes was standing behind the sushi counter.  It took literally 30 seconds of myself and my wife standing there at the entrance before he even acknowledged us.  No hostess was present or seen at this time.  Upon being seated, this same employee came to get our drink order and asked if we wanted to order anything from the kitchen.  The hostess finally came out after almost 10 minutes and took our sushi order.    Very sub par food.  Rice for our nigiri sushi was smaller in size but was cold and chewy, as in just came out of the refrigerator cold.  Maybe trying to use up some old rice that was left over?  Salmon and tuna was just \"ok\", quality not up to par with other ayce sushi places.  Against our better judgement we ordered 1 more order of tuna nigiri.  Rice was better but not really.  We mostly got filled on appetizers, of which the selection is very small.  Needless to say we will not be back nor can I recommend this place.  Service is severely lacking, along with serving cold and chewy sushi rice.  We had high hopes for this place, especially since our friend Manny had such good reviews.  He wasn't here today, but I don't think even he can convince us to try this place again.",

    "text": "Gotta be tough for Sushi restaurants in Vegas...  Not only is there so much competition, but there is GOOD competition out there...and of course we all compare one to another.  So let me start off saying that Sasa is GOOD.  It's far from bad, but it's not great in my book either.  Some notes :  Nigiri was hit and miss.  Some (like the sake) tasted fresh.  The Unagi was not cooked very much, so it was missing the slightly crispy edges I love.  The Ahi was SAD.  It was probably the pinkest colored ahi I've ever had, and the fish was FALLING APART.  They probably gave us the worst cut of the fish, one that most others would have THROWN out.  The Calamari was great though!  Light breading with salt/pepper seasoning.  I think this was the highlight of the meal...we ordered a second round!   Hamachi Kama. Very good, flavorful collar! It's a very SMALL one though, but at least it's done well!  Yum :)  Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll. Very good, and I love the presentation on their hand rolls!  Tasty :)  \"Pain in the Ass\" was probably my favorite roll : Deep Fried Salmon, Tuna, Avocado and Cream Cheese. Heavy, but good overall, with a nice kick from the wasabi mayo.  And to finish, I ordered the Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream. I didn't think it was bad, but Cathy really disliked it. Hit or miss?   So if you are in the area, give it a try!  But I'm not sure when I will be back...  Not sure why the pics aren't linked below :",

Letting him make and show us his culinary skills was by far the best idea we had that day with out a doubt   One of the perks that came with all you can eat was the sake!

Definite mistake!!  First of all the service was crap. I have never had someone stick there arm and shoulder in my face so many times. I actually had to scoot back and move or they would have rubbed their arm across my face.   Secondly I got salmon that was so tuff that I was able to bite down and rub my teeth together and it wouldn't bite through.   And lastly my sister ordered squid that she gagged upon eating. She actually had to spit it out in a napkin. I checked it and the smell alone almost made me gag. It smelled rotten. While moving the plate the squid actually stuck to my finger a bit.   The only good part of my meal was the dessert. Which only tasted good because it came pre-made and pre-packed.   I will definitely not be coming back. And for the price so not worth it!",

    "text": "We wanted to try out a new sushi place tonight for AYCE and thought that Sasa Sushi looked promising.  When we arrived, nobody greeted us for about two minutes until the guy behind the sushi bar told us to take a booth.  A few minutes later, we finally have a waitress who isn't polite in the slightest, but at least we were able to get a drink order in. We started to order our sushi, and at first everything was coming out very quickly. We ordered 5 more rolls and then all of the sudden, two people came in that seemed to be frequent sushi eaters there and it seemed like the sushi chef completely quit making everyone's rolls except theirs.  27 minutes later (yes I kept track of the time), still no rolls. Our bitchy waitress comes over and asks if we need anything. And I said \"no, we are waiting on the five rolls we ordered 27 minutes ago\" She says, \"oh okay\" and goes back to standing around with the other waitress.  No apology, no \"let me figure out what's going\", no nothing.  40 minutes later, we finally receive the last of our rolls and get the hell out of there.   They get two stars from me for having very fresh tasting fish. Other then that, this was a miserable sushi eating experience.  There is definitely better sushi places out there with far better service, sorry Sasa Sushi doesn't make the cut.",

It is hidden behind Capriotti's at the end of the shopping center and there are large trash bins in front of the business parking lot. This has never bothered me before. When we parked we noticed a lot of trash all over the parking lot and in front of the door. When we walked in I commented & informed the guy who greeted us that the front door area was full of trash and that I was a reluctant to enter. He said it was the wind that blew the trash towards the front door, but there was no wind at the time. It had obviously been there a few days. I spent $70 and we felt we ate in the ghetto!!! The owner/manager does not care about the cleanliness of the establishment upon entering. The food was good but I was very disappointed and embarrassed to take my mom there for Mother's Day.",

    "text": "Skip the appetizers!!!  So,  We went sushi hunting again. This time closer to home so we can hopefully reel in a location where we do not have to travel so far to. Sasa came up.   Hm.  OK so we couldn't find parking. Although located inside a big plaza, Sasa is hidden in a small corner where parking was limited to about 4 maybe 5 vehicles, and 2 of them theirs.   Ok.  Walked in and we were greeted, seated, and given our menus. If you follow me, you KNOW I KNOW, what I want. So we ordered right away.  What ordered:  Appetizers -  Shrimp tempura Baked green mussels 2 orders Tofu agedashi  Calimari Poke salad 2 orders Cucumber salad Salmon kama Miso soup  Sushi - Sweet shrimp with head Bank Birthday Uni Masago Ikura Tobiko  Chef special -  5 piece salmon sashimi Oyster shooters 2 orders  Soooo,  Let's start with the appetizers. Calimari had good flavor but had the texture of paper. Sorry Amanda G. In fact I felt that everything that was supposed to be served hot, calimari, agedashi, and mussels,  came out warm or nuked.  The poke. Oh the poke. They used a vinigerett sauce that made the fish not seem so fresh. I mean it was an OK mix, but poke is not suppose to be sour meh. The cucumber was not traditionally made. I mean maybe they were going for something different, but a mayo like sauce, nah, divorce the two, marry the mayo witthe poke, and the vinigerett on the cucumber salad and that may just be the match. Salmon kama came out great. In fact everything post appetizer came out fresh. Traumatized by the way the poke came out, we were pretty concerned about the well being of the rest of their food. I mean, uni is fresh sea urchin, so it has to taste right. To our surprise, their sushi was up there with some of the places we've been to. In fact the 5 slices of salmon sashimi that came out were 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick displayed on a banana leaf atop ice in a bowl.  Only 2 orders allowed btw for special dishes. The roes were not only attractive in color, but tasty as well. In fact, Sharo left surprisingly full by the end of the meal.   So why 3 stars Mikey?  We came in at the end of one servers shift, and the beginning of the other. And we all know how I rate. Customer service + food + overall experience = rating. Well, we did not get the best of service. Despite there being only 4 tables in total and 2 at the bar, we did not get the same overall treatment that we get in a restaurant that has 1 server to about 7 or 8 tables. I do not want to go in depth, but customer service can use some sprucing up.  Will not be our first place to go if other sushi spots are open, but may be worth a second chance if we just need to pick up.   Don't take my word for it, different strokes for different folks.",

The selection is amazing and the best part was I didn't have to dislocate my jaw to get a piece of overly riced nigiri into my mouth! It looks as if you're getting a smaller bite, but I prefer the rice fish ratio here. I can actually taste the fish! Service was a little chaotic because we had three different servers, but it really added to the AYCE, especially if you come hungry like we did!  I can't wait to go back, prices are better, size and selection is better. Overall, a great experience!",

Instead of offering to check on it, she told us that the fried rolls take longer and walked away, proceeding to ignore us. I grabbed another server after about 30 total minutes of waiting, to inquire about our order. He apologized profusely and got our food to us within 5 Minutes. Indifferent girl is still ignoring us. There are plenty of other good sushi places with great service that we will take our business to. As far as the food, it's definitely not as good as it used to be.",

Sasa gives you generous portions of their fresh selection of fish. For dessert you must try their mango mochi and their tempora ice cream, it's amazing! Service here is on point and you will leave here full and happy!",

Service is friendly and sushi rolls at made fresh to order.  If you're wanting a dinner to eat and dash don't come here. This spot is real sushi,  made by real sushi chefs. This food is meant to be enjoyed and takes time to create. Our dinner from beginning to end was around 45 minutes.  Must Try when in Vegas",

We should've went with our first mind because we knew the moment we ordered our nigiri that something was off, the fish was not fresh at all, had a smell and I literally gagged as it went down. Nothing is worse than paying $60 to get sick. The rolls were mediocre and their eel sauce tasted watered down as opposed to its normal thicker substance, which wouldn't be the worse thing if just about every special roll wasn't drenched in the watered down mess. So not only did we not enjoy anything on the menu but the food poisoning was just the icing on the cake. I would've mentioned something to the manager but it was our anniversary so we just wanted to get out of there. We definitely will not be returning.",

Everytime we asked for a new roll he kind of rolled his eyes. Also with check in I should of got a house sake BUT that never came. Thanks buddy.  THE FOOD was BOMB.COM!!!!!!! Very fresh salmon nigiri. We would of ordered every piece of salmon in the place if we didn't want to try other items. If the waiter matched the food this place definitely would of had another star.  Would I eat it again? Definitely :) Just hope I don't get that guy again ugh.",

We went in on a Sunday afternoon and the place only had a few customers. The sushi chefs were very friendly and asked if the rolls were made to the way we liked them. They even suggested a few new ones to try, which made our experience even more fun! Great prices for All You Can Eat and will stay a favorite for our family for sure!",

    "text": "I came in for the lunch buffet as soon as they opened (11am). I brought my appetite with me and had some time to kill so decided to write a detailed review. This is a LONG post, don't say I didn't warn you, lol.   First of all, the people complaining about the staff/service must have come in at peak hours (when it can apparently get real crazy). For lunch on a weekday though, no one else was there but me. So of course, I got great service. Just putting that out there so other diners know what to expect. Also, for those doing AYCE, order HALF ROLLS so you don't fill up too quickly as most of their rolls are 8 pieces.   Now for the food. Their (Ahi and Salmon) Poke Salad was one of the best I've had. Nice and fresh INCLUDING the seaweed. Many times I've ordered this at other (more expensive) places and the quality was sub par. So I've been kinda wary ever since. But Sasa Sushi's Poke Salad has restored the faith.   The Miso Soup was just ok. There wasn't that much flavor but it wasn't too bland either. Safe to say I've had better. Next I had some Baked Green Mussel. This dish is a MUST TRY. I savored every bite! Their Shrimp Tempura was not that big but their Tempura Sauce is to die for! It's probably the best Tempura sauce I've ever tasted. Definitely recommend their Tempura selection if not for the sauce alone.   Now for the rolls. I had two specialty rolls and one regular roll. First, the Spider Roll -- I've never seen it presented like this. They had it wrapped in yellow soy paper (as per the chef), and it was sweeter than most of the Spider Rolls I've had. Their soft shell crab didn't taste as natural (I guess) as what I've had before. Not to say that it wasn't fresh or tasty, it just didn't have that soft shell crab taste that I'm familiar with.   Then I had the Volcano Roll -- which is baked, with scallops and sauce on top. Another must try! Their baked selection kind of has a distinct aftertaste that comes off as burnt foil I guess, but I only noticed that after I scarfed it down because it was just THAT good.   At this point I was getting filled up so for my last order, I got the classic -- Rainbow Roll. This was much bigger than I expected and tasted as awesome as I thought it would. I gotta say, their raw fish selection is nice and fresh. For dessert I had the Red Bean Ice Cream only because I'm starting to get tired of the Green Tea it's like everywhere I go there's green tea flavored something but I digress. I also had the Mango Mochi which aside from it not being firmly frozen, was amazing. I recommend it!  That's about it. Parking is available right out front and they have a TV at the bar. The bathrooms are nice and clean and the chefs are awesome and attentive. This place is definitely worth a try. Overall, I give them a 4/5 star rating.",

Told us to seat wherever we pleased (in her very unwelcoming tone - someone must have pissed her off), brother gave me a sign to leave, I said we'll stay (well it was late and I had my kids and hungry all at once) and give it a chance so then comes the server, who was okay, he was a tad better than the hostess but still had an attitude (owners please treat y'all's employees better!!!).   Now to sushi - it was subpar, (worst eel), don't remember anything above 3 out of 10 on any sushi and sides we had and we tried quite a bit.. Nothing stood out...  Service: (what service?) employees are just plain unhappy which makes customer unhappy (did I mention server came to bring food and still had food in his mouth? Hmmm guess we weren't the only hungry ones - keep it professional people, chew/swallow it before coming out that curtain... It's not that hard...   So another one bites the dust and off my list...",

The staff is always super friendly and the service is fast!  Also if you add $5 a person to the AYCE you can get the All you can drink with their tap beer and sake! #epic  Anyways this place is a must and reminds me of home in San Diego and is greatly priced!

Had not been there in around 4 years. What a change. Quality of food was awful. Everything dripped with Mayonnaise. The Man with the bald head who I believe is the manager was disinterested to the point of being rude. When I asked about one of the dishes the waitress walked up to him to ask about it. He did not even walk from behind the Sushi bar. My Niece gestured for him to come closer, but he didn't. We had decided to pay extra and order Dinner which he suggested so we could have the dinner items. They were awful. I am used to Screaming orgasm having slivered turnip or radish and enjoying that with the sauce, no vegetable. The Ahi was overcooked on one side instead of being lightly seared. The Carpichio Tuna was laid on a bed of gobs of mayo and some other reddish sauce. It tasted nothing like it did the many times I had been there before. One of the worst things is how filthy the rest room was in comparison to how it was before. The base of the toilet was caked with grunge and there was a full blood soaked kotex pad in the over filled garbage can. Ughh. So unappealing with dinner. I walked out of the bathroom and the Manager was playing Video games on his phone while sitting in a chair. I asked if the Restaurant had changed hands. He never once looked up or made eye contact just said maybe 5 years ago. My Hairdresser said she quit going there because it had gone downhill. Boy, was she right.  I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. There are many other amazing Sushi restaurants. This is no longer one of them.",

Some friends of ours turned us on to this place and it is absolutely AWESOME!  The fish is always fresh and the all you can eat is incredible. We have eaten at other all you can eat places and they all limit what you can have.  For example, I have to limit my starch intake because of health issues. We asked for sashimi. No problem. They didn't force the nigiri as other places do. The yellowtail jalapeno is one of our favs. The cucumber salad is to die for. The oysters can be done as shooters or on the half shell.   Other pluses are all you can drink saki or beer for $5, or both for $8. The tuna or yellowtail collar is really good if they have it.   We eat out all over town and this place is in our top 5 list for Las Vegas. Highly recommend.",

The place wasn't busy at all and the servers were quick in response. Quality of fish was very poor. I always lower my expectations since I've tried sushi in Japan but this was considerably lower than that expectation. Nigiri was all I ate and the fish was definitely sub par. There were a few pieces that definitely had a sliver of fishiness to it. (Fish aren't supposed to taste \"fishy\" when fresh or handled correctly.) Although, the ratio between fish and rice was fine. I can't complain about price as it is average.  I've had better in the Valley at the same price. This was close and convenient though so I'd thought I'd give this place a try. I'll definitely be going somewhere else next time.",

    "text": "We came here about 4 pm on a Thursday after a day of hiking and there was only one other customer in the restaurant. We ordered many appetizers and rolls and they all tasted quite good. The quality was not bad in my opinion and the fish tasted fresh. The uni portion size was a bit small though. There is a limit of two orders of uni and/or sweet shrimp for the dinner AYCE. We ordered a lot of salmon/tuna nigiri and ordered a couple of the rolls, including kamikaze and birthday rolls. We also ordered the eel and soft shell crab hand roll which we thought was quite appetizing. The price was reasonable at $26/ person for dinner AYCE. Overall, I would come back to this restaurant because my family and I had a great time eating here. The service was excellent and not as bad as the other reviews say. The chefs tended to joke around with the other customers but it was cool. So come here if you want good service and quality fish! Worth! AYYYY",

I normally am not a sushi eater, but am willing to try different foods for the experience.  To my surprise, I loved it.  This was my third time ever eating sushi (I'm normally a edamame and chicken teriyaki girl), but everything was so delicious and the presentation was amazing.  Some of my favorites were the salmon belly, escolar nigiri, yellowtail, calamari, and the fried tofu. I thought the food paired very well with the sake that our server recommend, who by the way was on top of everything.  I never had to ask for more water, and he kept taking away the dishes as we finished.  Excellent service!  I always have to have dessert, and the strawberry mochi was a nice ending to the meal.    Everyone working there seemed very friendly, and I really liked the decor.  I even enjoyed the music that was playing.  If I was a local this would definitely be on my rotation of places to go when I eat out.  On my next visit I will be sure to go again.",

Some salads lacked flavor and had tuff tuna. The price was way to high for the level of sushi. Plus they took forever to serve. There are better places in this area  with more selection. I will not return. The only thing good is the all you can drink beer for 5$ more. If I could give a 2 and a half star I would.",

    "text": "An easy four star review for me! One of the few AYCE sushi places I've seen here, and it's pretty great!  Their menu isn't as big as some other similar styled restaurants, however, we weren't disappointed with the majority of the food and service we received.  Me and my boyfriend came in fairly late, around 10:30. On Friday and Saturday, they close at midnight, and last call is about 11:30. The waiter was very kind about letting us read over the menu (the entire menu is available for AYCE!) I'm a huge fan of eel, and many of their rolls feature this delicious fish. Among our meal, we tried mainly their specialty rolls, the Mardi Gras being my personal favorite.  I must say though, I was extremely disappointed with the baked Volcano roll I had. The rice was mushy, and mayo tasted overly sweet, and the scallops were rubbery and overcooked. Maybe it was on off night, but it was very off-putting.  The waiter also brought us an oops roll. The chefs made a extra Screaming Orgasam, which was thoughtful to give to us, but we couldn't eat it! I'm horribly allergic to the green onions on the roll. So yay and boo :(  Overall, this place is certainly worth stopping by! Make sure your group isn't too big. It's a small place!",

Tempura is perfectly fluffy and crispy, and all the extra oil is drained before it is served to us so it is not greasy at all; his fish is carefully selected, processed and cut to make the perfect sushi items. He is a passionate perfectionist that is passionate about providing the best sushi experience to the customers. Scottish salmon is creamy and sweet, salmon roe is light, sweet and aromatic(unlike many sushi restaurants where salmon roe tastes salty and even a little bitter), spicy tuna on tempura mint leaves is perfectly balanced and light, yellow tail jalapeno is light in texture but rich in flavors. Highly recommended, try everything on the menu and you'll love them!",

The nigiri/sushi selection isn't as varied as places like Sushi Mon and Goyemon.  The sushi roll selection is similar to most places and my husband liked the rolls he ordered.  I was a little upset that they brought over a plate of tuna carpaccio and asked if we would like it.  I mean it's AYCE, if we wanted it, we would have ordered it!  Apparently the chef made it by mistake and was trying to offer it to different tables.  I saw them eventually take it to the back....since no one wanted it.  I also ordered yellowtail collar, although the outer cooked parts were good, most of the inside was raw and unedible...  They did have a sashimi option (1 order of one type of sashimi - about 5 pieces per person), which was a bonus that some other places do not offer.  Overall, I'd rather drive a little further down to Naka Sushi and pay a little less too!",

Took some friends and their small children to dinner and was told they have a kid's price for AYCE. When our chef, Arnold, saw that the kids really didn't eat that much, the bill was adjusted to a much lower price.......a gesture that will not be forgotten.  My wife has unique dietary needs, they were more then happy to leave out sauces and ingredients that she's sensitive to which i'm sure is a total PITA.  Can't stress enough that I think the fish is on par with a good non-AYCE place. Drinks are never empty and dishes were cleared quickly.  Since nothing is perfect, I will comment that after the change in owners and the remodel, one prominent wall was left mostly a plain white; in dire need of some beautiful themed paintings...........like maybe some Christian Lassen works.    (the last paragraph is an inside joke between the owner, Chris, and I........the truth is there's really nothing I can think of that would have made my dinner any more enjoyable)",

Other than that the place was great service was a little slow but it didnt bother me we were early and it was just me and my boys.  The Fish was bigger than the rice on the nigiri which really made me happy.  They had Collars on the AYCE!  5 year old kids eat for free!  I really liked that we were the only ones in there so Im tempted to say this place is terrible but it would suck to see this place close.",

They informed us that they had recently undergone a renovation, which is obvious as it looks really nice.  The selection is ok.  No sashimi with AYCE.  The rice was a bit off, dense and couldn't taste any rice vinegar seasoning.  It tasted like Uncle Ben's rice in my rolls.  Pricing is on par with average AYCE prices around town @ $26/pp.  There was no wait and light traffic at dinner time.",

Ended up ordering salmon avocado rolls, 1 salmon  hand roll and a Japanese lasagna. Picking up my order I noticed that there was a regular salmon rolls but not the salmon hand roll. I told the guy ringing up my order and they saw on the order it didn't say hand roll and that both salmon roll and salmon hand roll were the same price but the \"hand roll\" wasn't specified. They went ahead and gave me the rolls and made a hand roll in a few minutes with no charge so that was pretty awesome. Everything was pretty good expect the Japanese lasagna it was okayish and that is my usual favorite. One of these days I'll have to stay in and order ayce and binge on some amazing sushi.",

    "text": "Long wait to be seated, lack of service, long waits for food, no drinks, had to serve ourselves items we needed so we could eat food once we got it, unprofessional, and openly rude.  We stood in the door waiting to be seated for over 10 minutes even though only 2 tables in the whole place had people to serve, and there was 8 staff not assisting us (2 at sushi bar, 6 chatting together ignoring their jobs).  I ordered and so did my kids.  Despite asking for chopsticks, a fork, water, and napkins at least 6 times in 30 mins & not being able to eat this whole time because we didn't have stuff to eat the food with (we had cooked food, soup, and sushi) or drinks, we got most of it ourselves because they openly and rudely ignored us and attempts to get their attention.  When we did get the waters we were constantly out of water to drink (cup was 90% ice and had little water to begin with when they brought to us), we sipped ice cubes for relief because despite the fact there was more than enough staff, they were too busy chatting about their personal life issues.  They actually looked at us, then ignored our arms in the air trying to wave them over or even when we got up and asked for service!  The soup was good but is was mostly liquid and not much content in it so not filling at all, the meat was overcooked to almost beyond eating (think dried jerky meat), and the sushi was good quality cut meat but warm.  At the end of the meal a nice man joined us from returning from his break and relieved who we had.  He more than tried to make up for things, but by then (after an 1.5hrs) after all that we already knew we were not coming back.  We tipped well, but only on the condition that he get all of it and it not be shared with the others that were there.  It also took so long in between our food items that we ordered arriving that we did not even get it all in that 1.5 hrs and we ordered within 5 mins of sitting down because we already knew what we wanted when we got there.  Because of this, we left hungry and had to get drive thru!  OMG.    Unless you like being ignored, not getting your food or service, and have hour to kill while you pay someone for this, don't bother with this place.    There are so many places that want business that they value their customers enough to serve them when they try to give them business.",

I would be polite and thank for every dish drop I would just get ignored. Service might get through some of the negatives of the quality of sushi but sushi chef seemed not to care(u serve raw fish!) so disappointed I spent my hard earned dollar here. Attached pictures of dirty dishes on my table the whole meal. I never complain but it was just above and beyond a HORRIble!! Experience. I have met owner and I feel bad staff is representing them in this way... If ther is any doubt I will attach pictures of what we got served here... Dis colored fish...mushy urchin.and in this town of word of mouth me working in restaurants summerlin area this I will make sure no one ever waste a dollar in this place. Like I said I have met the owners and super nice people if u would like to email me about my experience pls do...place was like a ghost town. Now I know why.",

The sasa 99 is our standard takeout order and it comes with miso soup, house salad, 1 regular roll (salmon, tuna, or cali), 9 pieces of nigiri and 9 pieces of sashimi for $17.95. My gf and I will each get a sasa 99 combo and we are usually stuffed at the end. The house salad used to be much better, but now it seems like a handful of iceberg salad mix and a tiny amount of house dressing.  I've eaten here for AYCE on multiple occasions its not the best AYCE sushi place in Vegas, but also not the worst. My son does love the popcorn scallops here though.  My family will continue to come back because of the takeout combos, Its less then a mile from my house and my son loves the popcorn scallops.",

I walk in and was not acknowledged so I just sat down at the counter. Placed my order and the sushi was just so-so. Not bad but certainly not good. Crap meat in cali roll tasted kinda funky. Had to listen to the sushi chef complain loudly about other employees and then starts using vulgar language to describe female private parts with one of his regular customers sitting at the counter next to me.  None of the sushi in the counter fridge was plastic wrapped either.  Waiter was nice.  They charge $25 for AYCE which is the going rate here in vegas. Much better sushi counters at the same price around town.",

Good variety on menu and more vegetarian rolls than most places. The fried tofu \"nigiri\" was good and something I had never saw on a menu before. The sushi guys were quick and the rolls were rolled right where they didn't fall apart. I did hear them making snarky comments and having unprofessional convo though. This type of thing isn't a make or break for me but I know some would be offended. The waitress wasn't friendly at all. So overall a good place to get a sushi fix but there definitely isn't any special bells or whistles here.",

I find it interesting because usually the reviews are pretty accurate for my tastes in food.  Disappointingly, this was not the case for Sasa Sushi.  If you are in anyway a sushi lover, and have not been here, I would steer clear.  Since we have never been here before, we ordered very small for our first round (little did I know that would be our last round.)  We ordered salmon, tuna, cajun albacore nigiri, a few rolls, a few hand rolls, and a few items from the appetizers.  The rice itself was a little too mushy for me.  On the rolls, there was a bit more rice than I'm used to.  On the nigiri, the rice portion was perfect (small.)  On the nigiri, the fish portion was huge!  That would have been a good thing if the fish was perfect.  Unfortunately, the fish was horrible.  The fish itself tasted ok, but the cuts were across the grain and included a few bones/cartilage.  Not the best parts of the fish.  The apps were ok, nothing to brag about.  Same with the hand rolls, meh at best.  Needless to say, round one was all we wanted, and we left hungry.  The service by Sophia was great...friendly and attentive (hence the one star.)  Will not be returning and would not recommend as Las Vegas has an abundant sushi spots.",

Don't order the random appetizers that fill you up before you get a chance to eat the good stuff.  Dragon roll was great.  I was not a fan of the Big Cajun roll.  Thank goodness for the ice-cream and tempura ice-cream at the end.  Good service and great experience.",

    "text": "For one of my last weekends in Vegas I came to Sasa on a lazy sunday and had my typical sasa 99 while my friends got the AYCE.   3.5 stars, but I'll  round up to 4.    Supposedly the fresh fish at sushi joints on certain days of the week is just a myth, but I will say the fish was NOT FRESH this sunday.  Not sure if it was because it was slow, or leftover, but my tuna was not fresh, and my salmon was slightly slimy and falling apart.   Also, I was extremely disappointed because the Sasa was served on a plate instead of the bed of ice...it's a lot of fish to simply have sitting out at once, it's as if they just had given up on the presentation of fresh fish.   The only thing good about my Sasa 99 was the yellowtail.  worse, the service was pretty slow even though we were the only people in the restaurant.   I love Sasa and I've brought coworkers and so many friends from out of town, but the inconsistent quality of fish and spotty service is what stands between it's ranks of an average sushi joint and an outstanding one.   Overall: I'd recommend going on the weekends or lunch hour, it might be busy but you'll know the quality of fish shld be up to par.  Also be prepared for extremely spotty service if/when things get crazy.  Sasa has the best intentions and i truly hope it can grow and further develop its business.",

The way he asks you what you want to drink or order is very straight forward. Literally, straight faced. He basically looks like he hates his job.

Although the restaurant seemed busy, we were able to sit and start eating right away. Another positive note is that there wasn't a massive wait between the rolls.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been coming here twice a month for 2 years now and this is by far my favorite sushi place. Ive eaten enough sushi in my life to feed a small country and Sasa Sushi never dissapoints. So lets begin.  -Food-: The sushi is top notch, fresh and there are plenty of rolls amongst other assortments on the menu to choose from. (Reccomended rolls- Tracy 2, Paradise, Alex's Munchie, Mikes Mardi Gras)  -Service-: This is THE fastest most efficient sushi joint in town. I dont believe Ive had to wait more than 8 minutes (at the max) for a roll. I would highly reccomend sitting at the bar as the chefs (Manny, Kevin, and NIck) are nice, friendly, fun and energetic. The most important aspect in a restaraunt to me is engaging your client and this is exactly what they do.  -Environment-: The restaraunt is a smaller yet efficient setting. As soon as you walk in, the bar will be right in front with booths to the left of it and normal seating tables to the right. The inside is clean with white and bright green tones along with other fixtures.  -Prices-: The prices are comparable to other locations in town. I believe about $26 for AYCE dinner and $21 for AYCE lunch and add $10 for all you can drink. Individual rolls can run between $8-$12.  Overall if youre not looking for a fancy sushi bar on the strip but want something more conveniant, while still getting great quality sushi, this is the place to be.",

    "text": "They are RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!  We had a female waitress, only female there, who lacked manners. We sat down and she brought us the menus, she immediately asked for our order. We order drinks and asked her to give us a second to pick the roles, she replied, (I'M NOT LYING) \"Ok as long as is not too long, since is Friday and we get busy, we might have to ask you to leave if you don't order soon\"... So we laughed, thought it was a joke, right? No it wasn't, she had a straight serious face...    Later, she came back to take our order, we had AYCE. Sushi was okay, nothing memorable. Earlier, when we placed our drink order she suggested $5 all you can drink beer, so my friend got that. When he finish his first glass of beer we asked the waiter for a refill, when she brought the sushi, which she replied (AGAIN, not lying) \"hmm I might have to ask someone else to bring it to you because I am not going to be in this side (restaurant & it is not big by any means) for a while\"... She left to attend other tables. She never asked anyone to bring that drink. Some other guy, helped us for the rest of the night, he was slow but  not rude...so it was an improvement. At one point during the night they brought us the wrong sushi rolls, when we told some other waiter that it wasn't ours he did not said a thing, just picked them up and left.   Let me clarify I am not a difficult customer and I always tip, this was the first time I withheld a tip. PLEASE spend your precious money elsewhere :)",

    "text": "We came here after reading so many great reviews. We came here right at opening on a Thursday. The waiter mumbled at us at the door and said go ahead and pointed to the booth. He seemed very bored/dry and uninterested. He acted like that with the other patrons so we didn't take it personally. The sushi chefs were personable to the customers sitting at the counter. We ordered apps, several rolls, nigiri, and hand rolls. Everything came out quickly. Good ratio of fish and rice. Overall we had a few items that were impressive, but most were average and didn't stand out. My husband and I loved the salmon skin and soft shell crab hand rolls. The kids liked the agadashi tofu and calamari. The poke salad was delicious. The super white nigiri was typical to other places. The pain in the ass roll was not as good as it sounded in the menu. They allowed us to order spicy tuna on crispy rice, which wasn't on the menu, that was nice, but the rice part wasn't as good as other locations. The Sasa roll was decent. Overall, the food came out quickly, but I wasn't all that impressed with the rolls and the limited appetizer menu especially with all the great reviews. It's good for a quick lunch, but didn't leave a strong impression.",

He failed after several requests to bring us tea to drink or containers to place soy sauce in. Asked for an order of yakatori with no sauce. I told the waiter three times please no sauce on the yaks tori. The waiter returned with yakatori drenched in sauce. We ordered all you can eat. The waiter disappeared for long periods of time so we could not place our order for additional sushi. The service was very poor. I would not subject my family to this poor dining experience again.",

I should know his name by now, but he's a younger guy with a pony tail and he's excellent.   We've been there a few times and now when we arrive, he already makes our favorites and we're served immediately.    $5 all-you-can-drink draft Sapporo?!?  All day any day?!?     I started coming here because the rude owner at Naka Sushi was so insulting, and I'm so glad I did.  Good food.  Good service.  Make sure you try the Sasa Roll.  And if you like spicy tuna...their extra spicy mix is the BOMB!!  They use tons of masago (Japanese caviar).  If you're craving AYCE sushi in the NW...I highly recommend Sasa over Naka.",

Secondly, for those who happen to have something of a small appetite, but, do enjoy the opportunity to sample (as do I), please know they do offer half rolls.  You do have to be looking for this place as it is tucked behind a line of buildings.  Once found, however, *it is a great find.*  I was so pleased to still be accommodated for all you can eat at 10pm (in a local neighborhood).  The interior is simple and clean, the staff was warm and inviting.  The music is contemporary, but, kept a level condusive for conversation, allowing for a nice, sophisticated vibe.  The server was knowledgeable, explained all the essentials from the onset, and, stayed posted at the front of the restaurant facing guests.  I happened in to this place on a night where I was dining by myself, and, and, felt not one bit out of place as there were several other women also dining solo, and, none of us were distracted from our meals in any way.   I ordered a series of items, the sushi chefs were quick, and, personable.  My choices included the poke, the salmon handroll, and, the house specialty (half) roll.  All of my dishes tasted so light and well prepared - with no heavy sauces or mayonnaise.  I truly wish I was capable of eating more - as the chefs continued to encourage.  I felt I'd had a most satisfying meal, and, left with a re-exhuberation of all you can eat.  I was completely satisfied, and, not in want of anything.   I used to come here often with the prior ownership, but, am so happy to have rediscovered it!  For anyone looking to for all you can eat in this area, I totally recommend!",

This place completely changed that for me. This is the only all you can eat place I will go.  I can't actually eat that much so I always get one of the rolls but my daughter loves the yellow tail, red snapper and salmon sashimi here. The edamame is wonderfully hot and seasoned and the chefs are fun to talk to. My only complaint is one waiter who could use a happy pill but even he is kind of funny once you get used to him. Great place, great food and I am so happy I tried it!  It's now a regular spot for my family.",

The salmon (saki nigiri style) was cut wrong so it was chewy and the pieces were not even close to being same size. The paradise roll was beyond terrible and the spicy scallop handroll was passable. I'm torn as to if I will ever return. It's close so I feel like I need to go again but sometimes it's better to bite the bullet and go further for better quality.",

My dad ordered the unagi sushi and he said it was good too. My reason for three stars is because all three of us ordered the katsudon pork bowls and the rice was not cooked. It was completely crunchy. Which ruins the entire dish. The staff apologized and brought out a small bowl of fresh rice which was still crunchy but better than the original batch. We were the only ones in the restaurant so maybe they were in a rush? The katsudon was ok. The ones I've had before had the rice soaked in whatever sauce they use. This one was dry and only on the pork. Overall, I would only come back for the sushi. So if you're in the mood for sushi this is your place.",

We got a continuous sushi feed and decent bicep workout of repetitions of chopstick to mouth. Free house Sake with Yelp check in. AYCE price includes soft drink.  42 pieces total of nigiri, 8 rolls, and ice cream. Nigiri: salmon, garlic tuna, albacore, yellowtail, red snapper, halibut, and cajun albacore. Rolls: spider, mountain, signature, Tracy II, Alex's munchie, big cajun, SSS, and volcano.  Everything delicious and no real complaints. Service was excellent from the sushi chefs and server. The fish slices on the nigiri were on the small side, but that's ok, just order more. The menu was dirty and sticky. Overall, nothing that happened during the experience was enough to keep me from coming back when I'm on this side of town.",

    "text": "This review is regarding the Yelp Order Online option for Sasa Sushi. I ordered the food 1.5 hours before the restaurant closed, paid via credit card and received email confirmation for pick up within 10-30 minutes.  Showed up at the restaurant 20 minutes after placing the order and the restaurant wasn't open, and likely was closed for some time since there were no staff closing the restaurant, everyone had left already.  I can only assume they closed early cuz it was dead, but now I paid for food, it was late at night and I was stuck trying to figure out what was still open for dinner and how I was going to get my money back.   I called the restaurant to get a refund and they've redirected me to Yelp, who I guess has Eat24 run their online orders. So we'll see how it goes.  So I would not recommend using their online ordering service if it's even a couple hours before the restaurant closes, because they may not be open when you try to pick up your food.  Edit: eat24 responded promptly with a refund.",

We've even come back several times in hopes that his attitude has changed or they have hired his replacement.  My family and I just walked in to eat. No greeting,  no host, no server. So the sushi Chef points us in the direction of a table and let's us sit. Then the server walked out, asked how many in our party, then walks away shaking his head at us. In walks a single patron after us who sits at the bar and he immediately gets her a drink....still we have yet to be greeted. Then he decides to take a phone order and help another guest all before greeting us. I'd like to say that this is the first bad experience we've had at Sasa but since his arrival to the team it's been consistently terrible. I really wish I knew his name but he's 30ish, tall, dark hair, and the worst attitude in the industry. We will never return. So disappointed because the sushi chefs and good are always wonderful.",

    "text": "This place is amazing. I've been to almost every single AYCE sushi place in Vegas and this place is hands down the best AYCE sushi place I've ever been to. The thing I love about this place is that they get our order correct every time. I can't stress how important this is because almost every other sushi place tries to skimp on their food. For example, if i get 2 sashimi salad, they'll use one fish portion and split it between 2 salads, or if I get 4 orders of shrimp tempura, they'll only give 4 or 6 pieces and not 8. But this doesn't happen at Sasa Sushi. They give the correct portion and correct amount every time. They also don't forget our orders like other sushi places frequently do.  The food is all excellent and tasty, the ama ebi (sweet shrimp) was sooo good and they use the biggest shrimps I've ever seen in a sushi restaurant. Everything was extremely fresh, the uni, salmon belly, and even the crab sticks were excellent. Service was excellent as well and our waters never fell below half the cup the whole time. The food wait time was extremely short even though the restaurant was packed.  One thing though is that their rolls selections aren't that good, and 90% of the rolls are shrimp tempura rolls with cream cheese. I didn't see any lobster rolls or soft shelled crabs rolls which was disappointing. So if you are into rolls then I wouldn't recommend this place, but if you are into nigiri with huge fish to small rice ratio, sashimi (yes they serve sashimi for AYCE!!), appetizers like oyster shooter, spoon specials (ask the server for this), and desserts (UNLIMITED MOCHI!!!), this is hands down the best sushi place you'll find in Vegas.",

We began with about 2 rolls and then manny started sending out spontaneous things. There was the poke nachos and a sesame poke plate. What a great and knowledgable chef. The food was great too, plenty of selection. But if you feel adventurous insure the chef will just push food out. The only reason why I took off a star was because one of the server was kinda cocky when we sat down at around 830, to find out later he was off at 9 so he was probably anxious to get off work.",

Later on, the waiter seemed a bit more sarcastic when we ordered because he kept walking away after we requested an order and we weren't even done.   Do not try the tuna carpaccio. It wasn't all that great. They did give us a chefs special and it wasn't all that great. It was like a deep fried spinach with some weird fish on it.",

My wife and I come in today and asked for a seat at the bar and they have literally no one sitting at the bar but on the bar was reservation signs. We were going to leave but decided to stay because we been here many many times in the past and the food is amazingly good. Well tonight what a disappointment from my favorite sushi restaurant. Oh to top it off the seats at the bar were never taken such bs. After years of coming here and recommending friends and family I will never come back even if it was free. The two waiters were absolutely rude. Your food sits on the bar as the guys are making it yelling out loud TABLE 1 !!!! ETC. what a joke this place has turned into. If I could give you zero stars I would. So your lucky your even getting this one star from me",

We had the gyoza, dynamite, green mussels, garlic edamame, and shrimp tempura to start. Everything was delicious. The largest green mussels I have ever had with the best flavor. My mom loved her gyoza. The filling was very well seasoned, and she had several more orders. I had the Sam's Volcano. Amazing salmon flavor. My sister had the Orange something, sorry I can't remember the name. I tried it.....I am in love. My mom ventured out to have the Japanese lasagna. I know it was a safe bet. She cleaned her plate. She said it was so good. I convinced her to try the nigiri. Wanted to get her the halibut nigiri, but it is a dinner item. I need to learn to read a menu. We will have to come back. Now that I have her hooked, I think she will go back with me. As my sister and I discussed, the 5th star is for the music. 80s alternative. Loved it!!! Can't help loving a place that is playing The Smiths when you walk in. I know it's a personal thing, but it made a great luncheon before my sister left Vegas. Please go try it for yourself.",

It's not a big place but there is a mixture of table sizes perfect for both big groups and smaller parties.   There is a decent sized selection of sushi. We decided to try the All You Can Eat Sushi AYCE. It was 25 dollars.   They have specific rules as to what you can and cannot due when ordering all you can eat. You can only stay for 1hr 15minutes when choosing AYCE.   We had the volcano roll, fireball, bank and Alex's munchie. They were very delicious. Of course they were on the specialty style sushi.  They make the sushi pretty fast. Its smart to just sit at the bar if you're doing all you can eat sushi.   The server was pretty attentive. She came around to refill our drinks. The sushi artists weren't very engaging, they just kept to themselves So not much interaction if youre gonna eat alone.   Speciality sushis were around 11 to 14 dollars. You'd get your moneys worth with AYCE if you just order 3!    Overall the sushi was very good and I would definitely come back to try the other rolls.",

The problem was the rice. The rice I got on all my sushi rolls was the same as the rice made with the teriyaki bowl so that being said all the sushi rolls had this grainy not fully cooked dry taste and just made the whole meal dry and very bad.

Started out with a pint of Sapporo on draft - cold and deliciously filled to the top, and a seaweed salad and edamame (hot and lightly salted).  Our server then tells us about their all-you-can-eat special. Well, that was a no brainer - challenged accepted!  Rolls and nigiri had were soft shell crab hand roll, caterpillar roll, Westwood roll, yellowtail - octopus - surf clam nigiri, fresh water shrimp nigiri with the deep fried shrimp heads (hot crunchy goodness), half a roll each of Alex's Munchie and shrimp tempura rolls and an eel hand roll (for him) and another soft shell hand roll (for me) for the finish!  Servers were attentive but not overbearing, food was all delicious and fresh tasting, presentation of food was appetizing, and overall nice and casual atmosphere. Definitely will be returning to Sasa Sushi for our sushi cravings! Posted a few pics, but food was so good, I totally forgot to keep taking pics as the food rolled out.",

They brought our sushi and ended up forgetting about the curry we ordered, we had to literally grab someone's attention to figure out what was taking so long for the curry. I had already finished my food long before they finally brought my boyfriend his curry, so we ended up asking for a to go box for it. We were handed the to go box with no comments or questions as to if we wanted to check out now or if we wanted anything else. Waited another 10 minutes before I decided to walk up and ask if we can check out, as the gentleman looked confused he said yes I can do it all right here if you want. They ended up charging me double for an item and when I brought it up they had to go verify with our waiter before agreeing to take it off. After taking it off the gentleman did apologize, but the service was absolutely terrible. I could understand if they were busy but there was only one other party in the restaurant and they had already been taken care of. Save yourself the time and money and go to Arata sushi literally a minute up the street from this place. Horrible service",

We both enjoyed the modern appeal of the decor. The misses mentioned that they had remodeled.   Now on to the food! The rolls were different than what I've had at other Sushi bars, but to be honest, I enjoyed that. We both ordered the AYCE, which by the way includes 5 pieces of sashimi. Haven't been to a place that includes that with your AYCE! We started out with the Tracy II, which was pretty good. I kind of lost track of the rolls after that point. Oh I did enjoy the texture of the Lisa Lisa. Ended with the Sasa and Alex's Munchie rolls. Both were delicious!   The staff were extremely nice and one of the waiters even asked us if this was out first time here. He was very informative about the menu.  The chefs were also great! I believe it was Nick and I'm guessing Mark. He made a couple of \"out of the box\" rolls for us. They were both friendly and fun!  Overall experience was great, and I know we will be back!! Thanks Sasa Suhi!",

The all you can eat and drink deal is great because you don't have to binge on rice and go right to the nigori and down all you can drink saki for $5.  The young sushi chef does nice specials too.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were visiting some friends in Vegas last week and were told we had to check out this brand new AYCE sushi restaurant called Sasa (pronounced saw-saw).   I liked this place from the moment we walked in. The interior was beautifully decorated, everything was clean and modern from the tables and chairs to the light fixtures. We were seated promptly and our server could not have been nicer.  Since we opted for the all you can eat option, we went to town and probably tried half the menu. We ordered all kinds of nigiri and sashimi including yellowtail, salmon, salmon belly, super white, and several types of tuna. We also got the fried tofu, a few orders of gyoza, yellowtail shoulder, and some miso of course. I rarely say this but I can honestly tell you that every single item we ordered was delicious! The fish was definitely fresh and of high quality, also the presentation was excellent. You can tell the chefs really love what they do because everything looked picture perfect. All the dishes appeared to be carefully pieced together and there were plenty of cool Japanese style garnishes that made for a nice presentation. My favorite items were the yellowtail sashimi and the \"Tracy II\" roll (if you like citrus and jalapeno flavors then it's an absolute must). Also the yellowtail shoulder was so delicious, it came out fully cooked but was remarkably flavorful and tender. We also ordered a bottle of cold sake which went unbelievably well with the food. I normally don't drink sake but the beverage menu was huge so we had to try something.  As for the service, everything came out fast and our server was really good about keeping our drinks topped off. The whole experience was just perfect, my girlfriend and I want to go back to this place as soon as possible. It's so rare to find food this good, especially for the price.",

Not only is the sushi fresh and fantastic, but the cooked dishes are also amazing. I also give the bonus points is that they have a great Japanese curry. most sushi places don't even serve curry. The interior is well designed and clean. Service is very friendly and fast . This place also has a very well curated sake menu. I tried several different kinds of sake and they were all wonderful.   I'm from Los Angeles and grew up not far from sush row, and worked in 2 Japanese restaurants....  this place definitely Holds up to any of them.   I would highly recommend this place,  It's a great way to end a long day of of hiking and rock climbing in Red Rocks",

I'm totally cool with mistakes were all human but it was almost like they were doing it on purpose? It wasn't just one thing it was numerous things like placing a tempura shrimp in a hand roll with the tail pointing up in the first bite what really? The octopus was so thick it couldn't be chewed literally had to spit out in my napkin (the ones I usually have to go in the back to get myself, on more than one occasion) Then we ordered a couple of special items (they made us these dishes on their own for us to try when we were trying this place out) fail. If you make someone something special to try and they like it, and they order again and again and then it's not the same or even close to all the other times ... What changed? People like consistency We were so disappointed. FOH servers are below average, it's like they do the bare minimum I've seen tables leave due to lack of attention, there is no consistency here.  We drop $75-80 for two AYCE  that always included 20% tip! We never overstay or overheat and are pretty low maintenance. So now we have to find a new place to drop that money.   I love it when people break up and say it's not you, it's me. In this case it's you!  Goodbye",

We came on a Friday night and the place was pretty busy. It is very apparent that the staff does not know how to handle busy peaks. We had three semi clueless people servicing our table. It was very bizarre.   We ordered three rolls, an order of nigiri, and green mussels. One of the three servers brings out the \"Mussels\".I point out that we ordered mussels and he informs that's what was in front of us.  I politely inform him that in fact I have seen a mussel or two in my day, and this was some type of a leaf tempura, not mussels. He looks confused, then he rushes off and comes back to inform us that it's really a complimentary chef's creation, and our mussels were going to be out shortly. Wow. I mean how could you even confuse the two?   The fish was not fresh and the creations were pretty much all the same thing. The service was extremely lackluster and a toddler slipped and fell as the family was leaving. They promptly grabbed the \"wet floor\" sign and put it up. They did check if the tot was okay, but then rushed to cover their butt. I mean, when the kid slipped it was apparent there was spilled water on the ground. Someone could have seriously injured themselves, or as a pregnant woman I shudder to think what could have happened.   Nothing about this experience warrants going back.",

It felt like we were bothering him by being there. It wasn't busy at all he had at most 2 tables. It was an off time and he didn't welcome us at all.

If you go for dinner you are able to order the special items for AYCE that you cannot order during lunch :  uni, oyster shooters, sashimi and some other meat items.    (My mouth is watering while I'm writing this). I would highly recommend going for dinner just for these specials :)  Did I mention all you can drink??? 8$ a person for beer and saki, and 5$ just for one of them.

Arrived by lyft, as I was going in they were closing and walking out!! They said I should have called! Really omg so rude! 2 other people came right after me. They probably lost over 300.00 by closing early. Wtf. I won't be back even though it was really good. I went back to try it again,this time sat at a table. It was the worst sushi and experience I've ever had. Never going back. Not sure how it was really good my 1 st two visits and terrible my next 2 visits  all with in 3 months???  So disappointed :(",

    "text": "Sasa Sushi is a joke, because of them I need to go back and re-evaluate Tokyo Sushi House that I evaluated yesterday and up them to a 2 star, unfortunately Sasa Sushi is much worse and they truly deserve the covenant 1 star.   I'm on a quest to rate all of the sushi establishments within 5 miles of where I work.  When I went to Sasa Sushi today for lunch, I walked in at 12:10pm and I was the only person in the restaurant, other than 2 sushi chefs, the host/waiter and what I believe to be the owner.  So there I am one person with the honor of having 4 individuals tend to my sushi needs. Under these circumstances, you would believe the sushi I was about to ingest would be amazing, why not, without any other tables or orders to distract the sushi chef from my order, I was sure I was in for a sushi experience like no other.   I immediately asked for extra wasabi and my waiter Ronald was quick to respond, nothing fancy mind you like you would normally see in other restaurants, just a small round plate with ginger and wasabi just thrown on the plate, very messy presentation. So I began to mix my normal soy sauce with wasabi and noticed the wasabi had no heat, so I added even more wasabi in an attempt to make it hotter and to no avail. The wasabi was clearly not fresh; I ended up with a paste so thick in an attempt to get some heat that you would have thought I was mixing grout for bathroom tile work.   I ordered the Poke Salad and it appeared very nice but I was a little taken back by the sweetness.  I then ordered the Kamikaze Roll and my usual Unagi Hand Roll so that I can gauge the quality of fresh fish to come by sampling the fresh water eel, oh my god, I nearly passed out with disgust as to what was brought to my table.  The eel was burnt, cold and just simply hard to chew; the only other eel in my life that tasted even remotely similar to this was what I once found in a can in the supermarket. Being the only person in the restaurant, the eel should have been freshly broiled and come to my table still warm, instead it was cold, burnt and had a consistency of beef jerky. I would be embarrassed if I took a client here, ashamed really.   I ended up sending both the eel hand role and the spicy tuna hand role back when they arrived because nearly 80% of the roll was rice and virtually no protein. Again, the eel was horrible, If I had to lay money down and bet, I would say the eel came from a can and was not fresh at all.    I went on to order Albacore and it came out dry and looked like someone had already chewed it and put it back on the plate (cuts all across the fish). I also ordered the Surf Clam and this came out slimy, surf clam never has a slimy sheen on it unless it's old.  I was trying so hard to make this place work, I tried as much as I could to see if I could find something on the menu to make the trip to Sasa Sushi enjoyable and worth it, but I just couldn't.   I ordered the Salmon Skin hand roll and it was the worst I had ever tasted in my life, the Salmon Skin was pieces of skin about 4-5inches long sticking out of the hand roll, not 1 or 2 pieces but what appeared to be the whole damn salmon, it was truly overkill. When I bight into the Salmon Skin hand roll, there was such a load crunch I believe people were looking around to see if metal was crumpling from a car accident outside. It was awful, I felt like I was eating a pork rind hand roll, it was way to crunchy and just too much of it. I then ordered the PCH Roll thinking, not too complicated, it's a roll with only three little letters for a name, so I thought to myself, as long as there wasn't any more of that dreadful eel in the roll, maybe this roll will be a winner. Who knew, how do you screw up a roll that has Tuna, Salmon, Cream Cheese and Avocado; simple, cut the pieces so big you need someone without just in case you need someone to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on you when you choke. Only 6 piece came out where there should have been 8 and possible 10 for a cut roll, the pieces were just too thick to be enjoyable, nobody wants that much cream cheese in their mouth at one time, unless you're sitting down to put the hurt on a lox bagel.   Sushi is about freshness, textures, flavors, combinations of flavors and the perfect balance of vinegar rice to raw fish. If any of these are not correct, it ruins the entire sushi experience.    Sasa Sushi reminds me of amateur hour at the Laugh Factory, although they did get a laugh out of me, as I said when I opened, what a Joke. I couldn't believe I was actually paying money for this crap, just about anyone could read a book at home and learn how to cut, prepare and assemble better tasting sushi than Asaa sushi. Don't waste your time and money going here, there's just not enough customers for the fish to be fresh, hence the Unagi in a can, slimy Surf Clam and already chewed Albacore.",

    "text": "MUST DO THE $25 ALL YOU CAN EAT! Getting two rolls basically makes it worth it. Don't think you can eat a whole two rolls? Just be strategic about your order and get the nigiris so it's less rice and you don't get full as fast! You can also order half a roll instead of a full size one. I definitely made my $25 worth by ordering two edamames, miso soup, three salmon nigiris, one crab stick nigiri, sweet shrimp nigiri & uni nigiri (can only have one order of these), half a rainbow roll, and both the green tea and red bean ice cream! I wish I had more room to throw down more food, but this was the point I hit my \"I'm full wall, but not too full that I'm gonna throw up\".   The only complaint I have is that some of our rolls took a really long time to come out, to the point that we didn't want them anymore. It was fine at first but when more customers started rolling in, there was definitely a back log and they couldn't keep up with all the orders.   But would def go back to get your sushi fix! Good quality (not the best, but good for all you can eat) and not an overwhelming menu to order from. Oh, you can also get $5 all you can drink Sapporo and house sake if you get the all you can drink sushi option!",

Asked for condiments and they had to be reminded twice. Waters were not refilled and the fish in the sushi rolls was not fresh. The seaweed salad was not fresh and the cooked beef we ordered was spoiled and smelled awful and had to be sent back. The sushi chefs were wearing baseball caps and kept coming out of the kitchen chewing- very unprofessional. We were offered a 10% discount after we complained. The place was not busy at all so I'm not sure why the service was lacking but I wouldn't return to this place or Waste my hard earned money here.",

I put in sushi near me and this place popped up. It had good reviews for the most part, so we thought why not?   I'm glad we decided to check this place out. The food was amazing. My boyfriend is very picky. He only likes to go to Yama Sushi, but I convinced him to try this place and try new rolls and he was amazed. We asked what rolls were recommended and tried all the ones they told us about and I dont have anything bad to say about any of them. We just went for it and tried a bunch of their rolls and all were worth it. I like red bean ice cream, but am iffy about the grainy beans in it, but I tried it here and it was better than I've ever had at any other sushi place. There were a lot more we wanted to try, but ran out of room in our bellies for anymore. Lol  One complaint I had that dropped my rating down, was the time it took to receive our food. We ordered a bunch of stuff right away because we knew some things take longer than others to get. Well, a few things we waited and waited for, at least 30 minutes, and nothing. We finally asked and they forgot to put them in, yet never came to check on us after they saw all our plates were empty for awhile. Their service could definitely be improved, to make sure customers are getting waited on quickly, but we will definitely try it again. By the time we were leaving the place was packed and people were waiting outside, but when we got there, there were a lot of open tables, so you may want to go on an off hour and not dinner time, if you don't want to wait.",

There were about 4-5 tables for AYCE and this made the service very, very slow.  The waitress was busting her bum, but had a hard time catching up, and only 1 chef meant excessive waits between orders.  The food itself was very good, and the fish seemed quite fresh, no complaints there.  Overall: a place worth visiting.",

But this time the service was horrible, and the sushi mediocre. It seemed the sushi chef had a lemon fetish, because nearly all nirigi had lemon squeezed on it. There was food ordered in the first round that came nearly 30 minutes later, like a bowl or rice!!! Oh and we asked for 2 orders of pork belly and it came to the table WAY over cooked and cold! This was my birthday dinner and I would say it is just slightly better then my parents forgot it was my birthday and took off for the night and they knew I didn't have my keys!   So basically goodbye sasa sushi, it was fun for 10 years!",

I recommend the hamachi and escolar bc those are my ultimate favorites. But you can never go wrong with nigiri!!! For appetizers you gotta try the popcorn scallops with yum yum sauce. And get the tempura ice cream for dessert!! :)",

Asked about ramen- and told the waiter I thought they had other plates and he said ramen was a special and pointed to a board.. Ok, so if he wasn't going to tell me the specials, I guess I had to get up to read them.. He finally offers the other menu.. Just seemed a little odd, but ok... Like, it was bothersome to get it... So I ordered the Sasa 99, which was beautifully presented, but the sushi seemed warmer than what it should be.. It's sashimi and nigiri and a small roll of your choice of tuna, salmon and something else.. I ordered, and SAID, \"2 Pork Katsu DON\" pls.. The Katsu Don came with miso soup and salad, which I was totally impressed with and the bowl didnt have an egg.. I told the kids it's what I ordered though...  So I asked the waiter why their Katsu Don didn't have an egg, he said it did.. I said that's what I ordered then..he said no you didn't.. Uh yes, I did.. I said pork Katsu Don.. He said no- you said pork Katsu only. That's fine.. U can argue with me.. No problem..  So, I went on to Yelp,  simply to see if I would get some sort of discount for checking in, and saw only the sake with an AYCE. My waiter, Tyler, approaches me again and says, \"I see you're posting a review on Yelp.. Even IF you ordered the Katsu Don, the kids already started eating the food so I would have to charge you extra.\" Charge me extra for EGGS?!? Ooohhh... I told him I know what I ordered, and he again said, no- that's not what you said. I said You didn't need to come and argue with me. Seriously?! WTF?!  Needless to say, water was never refilled,  checked up on us once, had to ask for napkins, and surprisingly, for the bill. They were getting 3 stars before the waiter approached me about the  Yelp review, so there's your 1 star..  I was excited about this place. How disappointing.",

    "text": "How can this place possibly have so many 5-star ratings?? It should be called So So Sushi, but even that would be too generous. The fish wasn't fresh, the server was boring and the rolls were completely uninspiring. Anytime I see a menu where a lot of the rolls have cream cheese in them, it disappoints me, and that was the case here. We tried this place because it's close to home. We normally go to Sin City Sushi at Eastern and Serene,  but didn't feel like making the drive this time. In the end, we wished we had. Our advice is to stay away from this place. A pretty good local alternative is The Sushi, at Lake Mead and Rampart.",

They've revamped new owner, staff, and chefs. They're AMAZING so happy that I can go to my favorite sushi place again. The chefs are passionate about what they do and will create you rolls based off of things that you like. Special right? I came last week when they were closed by accident and they still allowed me to order my food to go because they happened to have a chef come in early for a private party. Lucky me. Love them wouldn't eat sushi anywhere else. It's fresh and delicious.",

Once the food was delivered no one ever came by the table to see if we needed anything nor to refill drinks. There being only three tables in the whole restaurant, the other two just waiting on checks. To top that off, their register broke and it took half an hour for checks to be made.. They even had their owner come  to the restaurant and he only agreed to a discount after a disgruntled table were stuck there due to no check and no explanation..  I've honestly never experienced such poor customer service.. I understand if a register breaks but there are easy ways to appease customers and none of those methods were employed..

How awesome for them to go above and beyond to allow us to try things we never would have.  We ended up having a lot left over because of all the extra rolls they brought us but they weren't breathing down our throat or making us pay because we had leftovers.  Sushi was yum!

This time however, our waitress Mayra, (so she never even gave us her name, we had to get it from the receipt and someone else btw) was extremely rude to us. When she came to our table she greeted us with a \"What do you guys want?\" And proceeded to roll her eyes because we needed a few extra minutes to decide, after 3 awkward exchanges where we were afraid to even ask our waitress for anything because of her attitude, we decided to try and make it go more smoothly for both parties involved but she actually gave us a reason for her rudeness when my friend asked her, \"Did we do anything wrong?\", \"It's because you guys said you wanted 6 AYCE and AYCD and then you changed it to four.\" She said it as if miscommunication is a justification for being rude. I could not believe what I was hearing, at this point I simply asked for a different waiter, it makes no sense to spend nearly 300$ and be afraid of asking my waitress for service for fear of her rudeness. I love this place and I do recommend it as long as your waitress isn't the girl with the tattoo on on her neck. Word of advice: if people make you that miserable, you should probably not work in customer service. There are plenty of other places to work. Just saying.:-)",

Reached out to the owner on Facebook and she never wrote back. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Well, about a year ago, I was going to my favorite and closest sushi place, Sushi of Summerlin, and to my chagrin, they were shut down. The sign said \"Closed for Renovation - Will Re-open in June.\" Of course, in this economy, I thought they were over and done with, and I was upset, to say the least. Then about 6 weeks ago, I decided to see if another sushi place had replaced them and I saw that the sign said SaSa Sushi. I was happy, but who knew if the food was any good. So I went in and the inside was spruced-up. It was more up-scale looking than the old place, but I really only cared about the food. The banner that showed the prices (in the old place) was gone, so I asked them how much the \"all you can eat was\". It was about $5 less than the old place. This was about 3PM, and I saw a chef from the old place walk in to start work. Then I knew things would be okay with the food.  The ownership, host, waiters/waitresses, and a few of the chefs had changed, but the waiter that was there that day was excellent and one of the new chefs was amazingly fast. He was the first chef that could make sushi rolls faster than I could eat them, which is good when you're doing \"all you can eat\". So, better atmosphere, better host, better waiting staff, the same good chefs and food, and slightly cheaper prices.  I would've have given it 5 stars before the switch, so definitely 5 stars now. Oh year, I almost forgot...At 3PM a small saki is included in the price. I don't drink alcohol, so they gave me unlimited Iced-tea instead. So it's actually $7 or $8 dollars cheaper than it used to be when it was Sushi of Summerlin. Now, I just have to find a good Mexican restaurant, and I can die a happy man.",

But it seems like I always get poor service. Our server last time didn't act like we were there. People on either side were getting their food, and they got there after us. One table even got our order, and they took it!  It's ayce why would they turn it down?... maybe cuz they didn't order it. They almost got our second order. But the sushi chef corrected the server. We had to order calamari twice cuz they kept forgetting. Then they brought us 2 orders. The time before this, the sushi chef took my order, started to make it, then while playing around with other coworkers, Forgot to finish my roll. 10 minutes later I heard him ask what this was for and then realized he forgot and finished making it. The food maybe good... If you ever get it. Hire a new staff. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!",

The cream cheese on top was warm but the combination of cold roll and hot topping was odd, and by odd I mean bad, and by bad I mean horrible! The service was pretty shitty, I shoulda sat at the bar. I was getting really angry after having been seated for 15 minutes and had not received my water or even wasabi or ginger. Now that I think about it I NEVER got the wasabi or ginger throughout my whole meal. The server was nice when she came around. She did get tied up cashing out a large party so we can't blame her for that. But seriously she was gone for like 20 minutes. The poor guy next to me got up from the table and took his empty cups up to her so she could refill them. The sushi chefs seemed nice but I absolutely will not be back there.",

My family makes it to Sasa on average twice a month because the food is so good, but last night there were so many minor issues that they added up to one lackluster visit.  First, it smelled bad as we walked in.  Then we ordered green tea and that even smelled stronger than usual that night.  We order 4 rolls and 3 appetizers but we finished all our rolls before we even got our appetizers because service was so slow and then when our first appetizer came, another foul smell of burning metal came from the kitchen with it.  The teriyaki beef, a go-to favorite, was old and dryer than usual.  Their new recipe fried calamari which was so delicious on our last visit was inedible this time.  The sushi rice was old and the wasabi was not its usual bright green color.  Again, I know Sasa so we will probably go back in two weeks despite this one bad experience but if we have this same low quality food next time, it will be our last visit.  It's just too expensive to have low quality food.  I have not seen the owners for a while so I wonder if it is under new ownership.",

Lol I work at an AYCE restaurant but this place is my shit..the servers aren't always the best, I'm ALWAYS satisfied with the sushi chefs, always sending us things they know I want even before ordering it and making panda oranges for my baby, but server wise im pretty much only always happy when the short Asian girl serves us. I forget her name, but she's always on it and always checks on us, busy or not. The other servers kinda always seem like there in a rush even when it's not busy, forgets a lot of things we order. Since I work in an AYCE restaurant I know how it is so for the most part it's not a big deal, but when were only one out of 3 parties there i just feel service should be a little better. Besides the service sometimes I still give this place 5 stars because I just love the food so much!! Didn't even go there today, was just craving it so decided to look at pictures on yelp. Lol but yeah MY FAVE SUSHI PLACE!!!",

We got Cajun roll & mango crunch (which was kind of like a dessert roll but very good). I also had the kamikaze which had nice sweet eel and crab (though it didn't say that on the menu and I usually don't like crab) but it was good too. Super white tuna was pretty fresh and buttery but less ponzu sauce than I usually like. Cajun was awesome & not dry like I've had at other places...great spicy Cajun sauce too. All the sushi chefs were friendly & kept asking how we liked everything. The dessert came out in an orange carved like a bear...pretty cute! They have a nice selection of sakes although I didn't get to try any bc I was too full. I definitely left probably 5 lbs heavier! Not too far from our house so we'll definitely be back!",

Similar menu with the addition of some new rolls and a couple deletions...of course one of the biggest disappointment--the Todd Roll has been removed.  It was not only my fave, but I used to hear others order it as well.  I'm sure they would make it if you asked.  Service was a little faster than before (that was one of the problems--slow service), but could've been a little more friendly.   I'm sure they are getting tired of people walking in and not knowing what to expect and answering questions.  The interior looks really nice--exterior is the same, but it's in a strip mall.  I got one order of nigiri, ok.  And a couple rolls.  One prob still w/their rolls--pieces are cut huge and a LOT of rice.  Taste was pretty good.  I might go back, but as others have posted, there are sooo many sushi places to choose from....we'll see.",

I consider myself a sushi-fanatic and I tried many of our fine sushi joints in town. For AYCE place, this is one of the best. What really stood out was the portion of the rice to the fish on the nigiris. The rice portion is tiny, compare to many other places. The nigiris were fresh and quite tasty. Tako was one of the best I've ever had. Superwhite and cajun albacore were probably my least favorite here. The chef prepared some off-the-menu, specials for us and they were DELICIOUS! He even made an Uni special, which was totally surprising. We were just doing the lunch AYCE, so uni isn't included usually but he pleasantly served us a yummy special! He also prepared a Tuna belly special, which was exceptional, as well as another one w sashimi wrapped in a leafy cone. Thx again Chef! Will return for sure! Any our Miss Waitress was really friendly and efficient w the service! (Sorry, forgot ur name ;P)",

We chatted a bit with our friends and then sat at the bar becuase we were only going to have a roll or two. Our friends, who were on a first name basis with the chef at that point, told the chef to take good care of us. The chef was very friendly and took our orders quickly and produced plate after plate of tasty nigiri selections with nice sized portions of fish and easy on the rice (I'm sure this was due to the influence of my friend). Either way, the sushi was good for a neighborhood sushi restaurant and we ate our fill. The only hiccup was when we went to pay, nobody was keeping track of what we ordered, they just \"assumed\" we were on the AYCE. So we ended up paying the AYCE price for 2 people for dinner when we were being careful not to over order so it wouldn't be too expensive. Not the biggest issue since we were close to that price anyway. I would recommend Sasa Sushi if you're in that neck of the woods, and just get the AYCE...it's easier in the long run.",

I was amazed by how fresh their uni was. The first time I visited was a Friday night. We arrived at 7:30 and seated right away. The sushi chefs are very friendly and laid-back. Our server was attentive and even took back the Cajun albacore that didn't taste so great. The volcano roll was yummy. The salmon, super white, and scallop nigiri were all fresh and plentiful on the fish to rice ratio. I used my Yelp checkin for a free sake! I went back again less than a week later and the service was horrible. It was a Wednesday night about 9pm and there was only one server handling the 3 tables there. We had to wait 20 minutes before he'd even take our first order, but we watched as he was boxing up food for another table and taking the check from another. I'd definitely recommend going on a weekend rather than week night. If this review was solely based on my 2nd visit there would be 2 less stars.",

My husband and I were very disappointed, their sushi seemed not authentic and fish is pretty thick and very dull/plain taste. Their rolls might be good since I didn't order them but if you want to eat Nigiri, I don't recommend.",

Like the 'star leaf'? Can't remember. Super good!  The server at first seemed rude but warmed up to us later. Only reason for taking off one star because it wasn't a good first impression.

Japanese Lasagna - excellent, probably the best I have ever had.  Mighty Roll - Excellent  Sasa Roll - minus the sriracha   sauce - great flavor combo.

I come every chance I get when I'm in town, about one Saturday a month and sometimes again the very next night for dinner before I get back on the road.

And the lemon slice gives it just the perfect kick), SSS and Double D. I'll have to take pictures next time.   I came in with five other people for this visit. The staff is so friendly and quick to get drinks and appetizers or rolls started. We had so much sushi at our table I can't even remember which rolls I was eating.

Had the pleasure of Nick as the sushi chef and Joe as our server.  Both were courteous, friendly, and efficient with our orders.  All food was very good.  Had poke salad, nigiri, and for our first visit Nick made most orders a half roll so we could try many items.  Everything was very tasty.  Only thing I did not like was that some of the rolls that were torched were tasty, but had a little fuel after taste, and as some other reviewers have mentioned, the nigiri was microscopic in size.  I have only come across one other sushi joint that served this way.  The salmon belly was very tasty, but four pieces were only equal to one regular order that you would receive elsewhere.  Other than those minor issues we would definitely go back again.    Nick also surprised us a couple times with items we did not order.  He made an off menu item called the 10K, and another one called The Black Widow.  Both very tasty.  Will give a second try later and see how it goes.  A tad on the high side price wise compared to other sushi places along this Cheyenne Ave. corridor.  $21.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner, both AYCE.    Great job Nick and Joe.",

Service....uhmmm....now bottom line and hands down they have specifically 1 of the most WORST waiters of all time! He's rude, he's a know it all, he ignores you, he's cocky and arrogant and No one seems to enjoy having him around(NOT EVEN THE STAFF)I'm surprised that he's still there and I've been going there for just about a year now!  Needless to say that I will not return with my friends or family not because they have the worst food but because it's not very good and I find it hard to enjoy a meal when you're not happy with the food and the server!",

We remembered our first experience being good and the sushi flavor and portions were great. After I got home I started experiencing some stomach pains. My stomach got very upset and I started vomiting. This went on all night to the point I had to call in sick to work. I'm guessing it was the ikura nigiri I had ordered since my bf did not eat it and he was fine. I did not eat or drink anything other than water after we dined there so it was definitely the ikura gone bad. Sad to say we thought we found a decent AYCE sushi place but we will not be returning. Back to Umiya it is.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that ever since moving to Vegas a year ago we would go and bring our 15 year old son here EVERY month.  We loved it and the guys that work there.  That being said this is what happened yesterday to me and my husband! We walked in and went to the \"bar\" area, ordered two beers and one glass of ice water.  As always the waiter said, \"are you having AYCE?\" As always we said no.  Between the two of us we only need one or two rolls and getting the ayce is a waste of money.  Well the guy who we have never had before said that we will regret not getting the ayce and then laughed.  So we went on to get a salmon roll and japanese lasagna.  The salmon roll was delish (as always) the japanese lasagna on the other hand was hideous.... GROSS!!!  Then we ordered yellow fin tuna roll and that was also really good.  Then here came the bill.... our bill was over $40!  we figured around $25.  The rolls are usually $4 the beers around $3.50 and the yukey japanese lasagna was close to $8.  Well after looking at the breakdown after the sticker shock!!!  They charged us for the sushi on the other side of the menu and not what we clearly pointed to on the menu.  The Hawaiian roll $9.95 and the $8 for the lasagna and Hamanchi Lover's Roll $10.50!  Making our total bill as much as the \"AYCE\" he was right we would regret not getting the ayce!  Ayce is $21.95 each but we only ordered and pointed to the rolls we wanted.  This was not our first rodeo here and we know what we order and have done so for OVER a year. The sushi chef knew what we pointed to and the waiter rang it up the way he wanted to. NEVER AGAIN even though we do love this place but buyer be aware!!!!  Make it VERY clear what you are ordering and double check!   Sad for us but NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I was however sad because one, i'm used to have having nearly 2 full pages of sushi options, and this time i had about 6/7 of one page. Not to mention nearly everything was a bit too sweet for my tastes and the spicy options werent exactly bursting with flavor. Not to mention the red bean ice cream which is my favourite ice cream wasn't all that great. Aside from that though the sushi was pretty good, it tasted fresh and was good quality. So even though i personally didn't care too much for it, I would say its a decent place with good food.",

Service was extremely attentive and the sushi chefs even created rolls for us that weren't on the menu as a surprise. (Which we loved).  Portions were on the small size, but since it is all you can eat it's not really an issue and the rice is proportionate. Restaurant is extremely clean.  Fantastic experience, I think we've found our new sushi place!",

We tried the Paradise rolls as well, but I didn't like the flavor mix. We sat at the Sushi bar and the chef was cool and good company. I loved the Alex's Munchie so much, I ordered a second roll. I thought to myself, I'll definitely come back to this place again, good food, cool atmosphere, and as I take the final sip of my beer, from the corner of my eye I see something moving on the counter. I lean in closer and realize its a baby roach. I smash it with my napkin and tell the sushi chef. He calls one of the workers to come over and just then, another baby roach is crawling on the wall next to me. Talk about spoiling my whole experience. We managed to laugh it off, but on the inside I was dying. Had it not been for the roaches, I would have given 4 stars.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review because I feel like this place has a few small problems that if were fixed would turn it into a top tier sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.   We showed up at 6 pm on a Friday night. About a 15 minute wait. No problem, it's a small place. We were seated and given menus and we placed orders but didn't receive our first roll until nearly 30 minutes after we ordered.   I believe the reason for this is the place was just slammed. They got unlucky and a whole bunch of people showed up at once and the orders poured in. Nobody left for the first half and hour we were there. They've got to streamline their back of house to take care of this situation. The food was trickling out of the bar when there were four guys back there.   The servers did a great job of making sure everyone was as happy as possible but there is only but so much servers can do when there is no food. On top of it more than a few tables got rolls they didn't order, I myself got a double order when I clearly placed one order. This kind of stuff just snowballs inefficiency and really adds up. Some of the rolls were very tasty. My favorite was the mango crunch. It was fresh and new and different. On the other hand other rolls were very lazily made. One of my rolls wasn't sealed and fell apart every time I picked up a piece. Another roll was sloppy and clunky and made eating a mouthful at a time impossible.   The food was good though. The nigiri was fresh and the portions of fish were generous. The free house sake with check in was great.   At times some of the servers seemed a bit unprofessional and were scratching and moving in odd ways. Nothing devious of nasty, just not the demeanor a pro server should have.   Overall If this place tightened up the rough edges just a bit this is an easy 5 star for me. It was worth the money to try. I'd recommend going when it's not busy. Lunchtime or a weekday.",

Stood by the door and waited to be seated--no one greeted us or even acknowledged us like a typical sushi joint with the \"irrashaimase---!\" Okay, fine.   Another 5 minutes went by, still nothing. Eventually a sushi chef finally acknowledged us and asked if we were still waiting and how many in our party. The sole server (that we could see anyway) finally appeared, and asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or table. We said bar. Then he told us to each sit at the corner of each other by the end of the bar, and just pulled the chairs closer. All the whole a couple sitting at a booth complained because it had been 10 minutes after he had taken their card.   I don't know if they were just short staffed or unorganized, but it left such as sour taste in our mouths that we just left and went to another sushi place nearly. And too bad! They are supposed to have amazing sushi!",

They do have an all you can eat and drink option for about $32 bucks which I thought was a bit steep until I saw their specialty roll prices. For 10-13 bucks per specialty roll if you can eat at least three it's a bargin.   I had the shrimp tempura roll and the California roll. Both were okay but the shrimp tempura was better for sure. I was not super impressed by the quality or the crazy amount of rice though. Give me more I the insides please!!!!  Overall I probably would come back only because this place is close to my house and my friends like it, but personally there are much better sushi places in Vegas for the same or similar price and better quality rolls. Dont cheat yourself- go here for the experience not just for the sushi.",

I've got a serious scallop allergy and my daughter a allergy to crab and in the few years that we've come here they've never once cross contaminated our meals, which is the number one way to make me not eat someplace.  Also they get to know the customers and have built a great chef to consumer relationship with my family.  Our favorite thing is that we can walk in and not even have to order off of the menu.  They know and remember the things that we like and some of the one we don't.  They also surprise us with some amazing creations that off menu.    We bring all of our friends here when they visit from out of town and they've all said its some of the best and freshest fish that they've had in Vegas.     The fish and food is also fresh, tasty and never has that off fishy taste that is often found in local ayce places.    I've seen a few bad reviews of late and I'd like to say too that the guys that work here are a fun bunch.  Some people need to lighten up and just learn to have some fun while Dealing with chefs.  Also, In all the time that I've been here I've never once seen/heard them call someone names. I'm a woman of size and have never been treated disrespectfully by any of the staff.   So.   You want a good sushi place in the NW. Give Sasa a try.  You won't be disappointed.",

I initially just wanted to have one roll, edamame and miso soup but as I started to look at the rolls it made more sense price wise to do AYCE.  I sat at the bar and I'm glad I did. Nick, the sushi chef was amazingly pleasant! I told him I was a fan of ponzu sauce and I loved rolls with the jalapeno. He made a 2K roll, a tuna carpaccio, an amazing mint leaf dish and other things that he said were not on the menu that would he thought I would enjoy. The presentation of the dishes were also suprisingly nice. Nick even made things off soup spoons like they do at higher end restaurants! Nick truly made this experience a pleasant one!  For you die hard sushi eaters, this place is AYCE is all you can eat so do not expect the finest quality of fish but I can say that Nick made all the rolls and dishes superbly!   Parking was easy, service was great and it is well worth the money! I will definitely be back and will bring my friends next time.",

With this in mind, I grabbed takeout but my limited interaction with the staff was positive and I appreciated how quick they were.  The SASA 99 BENTO BOX is a great value- it's on the lunch menu but they allowed me to order it at 6PM. Order consists of 9 pieces of chef-selected sashimi, 9 pieces of nigiri, a choice of one basic roll (I went with the California), soup and salad. The cuts of fish were generous and thick, and noticeably fresh. I was pleased to see that the California roll was packed with crab and used minimal rice. Soup and salad were forgettable, but for $17, this was a great deal and a giant amount of food. Added on a 3-piece of gyoza (tasty but the wrappers were thicker than I'm used to) and it was enough for dinner AND lunch the next day.  I wasn't blown away by my order but I was decently surprised- so many AYCE places shaft you by packing on the rice, giving thin cuts of fish, etc but I would come back here again, either for the same order or to try something different.",

I was kinda anxious about their AYCE rules with 1 hr and 15 min time limit for dinner! Haha! Not that I plan on \"camping in\". I can't eat as fast I want to! No one wants to choke while eating their meal!   Appetizers: 5/5 Poke salad was garnished with some seaweed. It was fresh and delicious with just the right amount of dressing in it. Other locations dredge their poke salad with the sauce and that's one of my pet peeves.  Tuna carpaccio was super yummy! Love the mild sweet sauce with a kinda garlicky taste to it served with mayo underneath. Amaebi was one of the best I've had! Love the lightly breaded flavorful shrimp heads!   Nigiri: 3.5/5 Salmon belly, eel, and tuna were really fresh, but my first few pieces of the nigiri, sushi rice was a little bit undercooked. Rice to fish ratio was awesome! Perfectly sliced thickness with VERY small amount of rice! We will see IF the second visit will be the same ratio.  Sushi Rolls: 4/5 The only sushi roll I ordered from the menu was the Sasa. It has shrimp tempura, spicy crab, cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. The sauces were mayo, sriracha, and eel sauce. I really like it a lot, but it could have been better if the shrimp tempura had some crunch to it. The rest of the special rolls I've had were made by Nick who was superb! I was game for anything he can create! And oh boy did he impress me!   Small cut of sashimi served in the traditional Asian soup spoon with a sweet hint of sauce was delicious! This creation was repeated, but this time it was served on fried crunchy edible leaves. The next roll he whipped up was a tuna roll with tuna, crab, and scallops. It was garnished with super creamy sauce and jalepeno for added heat.  Deserts: 3.5/5 Yuzu sorbet! It's about time someone gave me a full scoop of this goodness! Most places either give you about a tablespoon or it looks like a full scoop, but it's hollow inside. Really? You think I can't tell the difference?!? LMAO!  Green tea tempura ice cream was just \"okay\". Green tea was weak in flavor and not as creamy as other green tea ice cream I've had.  I would definitely come back since I barely tried out their menu selections, but I would probably not come here with a large group since there is a time limit of 75 minutes. BTW, they have happy hour with 20% off their a la carte sushi rolls from 2pm-5pm.",

The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is that I believe very small restaurants like this one shouldn't be taking reservations for small parties.   Not only that, they weren't even sure which seats at the bar area were actually reserved or not. We were waiting for 35 mins for first available for two and once we sat down and got halfway through our meal, the hostess looked at the 4 bar seats next to us (that had been available since before we got there) and had to ask a chef if it was even really reserved or not. And it was extremely irritating to hear that they weren't even actually reserved for anyone! So we waited 35 mins to be seated for nothing.   All that aside, the food was great and I am definitely willing to come back and try again. Hopefully the service will be more capable next time around!",

Bad. When I went in I could barely breathe I don't know how people were eating in there.  Two, my rolls just weren't that good I threw the rest away. I got a rainbow roll and two orders of nigiri. Their spicy mayo wasn't mixed and tasted terrible.   Please take more time to quality control your food and take care of your restaurant! If you have maintenance issues close the restaurant, don't let people eat in a bad smelling environment.  Lastly, I'm confused how this place has four stars! Really wanted to like this place and I don't enjoy writing bad reviews but the reviews below mis-led me and I don't want others to be led astray.",

The food is phenomenal, but their are some simple things could be improved on.  Better TV programming, I love eating sushi and watching sporting events. You could get a better selection of channels. Especially sports obviously, once that occurs you could get one or two reasonable sized televisions. Considering football season is about to begin that will be a major draw for fans of the game and sushi. Just a suggestion.  Donald and Manny are the best!!!",

We loved Sasa Sushi - free sake with Yelp check-in (or if you're a first time customer, so make sure to tell them!), phenomenal rolls that were just the right size (not too big, so you can try more), you can order half rolls right from the beginning, and the chefs will bring out special treats if you tell your server what you like. While waiting for a roll they brought us a tempura fried asian mint leaf(?) with a piece of tuna on top - it was delicious!  The servers were really attentive and we never had to flag anyone down to put in another order or ask for more water.   This is definitely our new favorite sushi place within a few miles of our house. We will be back...weekly...",

If there was rice it was a small amount and I was still able to enjoy the fish. This is not a place that tries to fill you up on rice. Satisfied as to the quality, I ordered some things I would order at a more familiar place, a few rolls, kama, appetizers. Everything was delicious and well prepared. Combine good service, great food, and a reasonably priced AYCE with optional all-you-can-drink and there isn't really more I could ask for.  P.S. A sixth star for being a block from my house.",

I ordered take out from here and while I did get everything I ordered they also put some random nigiri in the box that after a lot of googling I think is squid. That might be lucky if you eat fish but I'm a vegan so it was kind of a problem for me. I didn't want to eat the rolls that had touched the fish so I ended up tossing out food that I paid for. Not that it really made a difference because my yellow radish rolls tasted like straight up fish too which was entirely off putting and I didn't really eat them either. I didn't eat anything really except my normal-tasting inari. Lesson learned - don't eat sushi in Vegas, I guess.",

They have good reviews and by the looks of the pictures, the food looked good too. Oh My Goodness! It was delicious! The Mark Roll, The Mango Crunch, The Sasa Roll...........

This trip we had a hard time getting this chef to even get our requested selections right. The fish was not fresh. Hard to eat tuna when it's brown instead of red. Even my favorite poke salad was sub-par. Looks like I need a new favorite sushi restaurant. This is getting hard since they all start off really impressive then slowly go downhill.

    "text": "Of all the sushi places I have been to in the twenty years I've been here, this was one of the worst. No greeting at the door, actually no response period. Wasn't that busy, 4 people at the sushi bar, where we wanted to sit, but the empty seats hadn't been cleaned yet. Had to wait for that . Absolutely no friendly interaction from the bald sushi chef when we sat down, didn't even acknowledge us. Too busy with the two tables behind us and the obese couple sitting in front of him to bother with us. When we did get his attention, never once looked at us or asked if we wanted anything, so ordering was an ordeal. In the meantime the husband of the large couple at the sushi bar was talking loudly on his cell phone, so we had to listen listen to that for the next 14 minutes, still trying to get the  Sushi chefs attention . After only two hand rolls sloppily put together I was done. Have had better sushi at Smiths grocery store. Asked for check while listening to a kid screaming at the table behind us. Finally went up front, check was almost 60 dollars for maybe the thirty dollars worth of crap that was impossible to order. What a horrible experience. First time in twenty years I have ever not left a tip. The bald sushi chef was absolutely the most unfriendliness and unprofessional We have ever encountered. This was our first and last visit to this dump. Nice experience for Mother's Day?!",

    "text": "Oh my god, this place is so terrible!! The health department needs to crack down here. I got AYCE and the first thing that arrived was the amaebi nigiri... I took one bite and was absolutely certain the shrimp was spoiled. I eat authentic Japanese food all the time, I grew up on it, so I know what amaebi is supposed to taste and look like. This was the worst shrimp I've ever had in my life; it was slimy, overwhelmingly fishy-tasting, and the outside was starting to disintegrate. What really concerned me is that when I told the waitress, she just wordlessly took it and tossed it out... No apology, no reaction, no concern... Which makes me suspicious that spoiled fish is a regular problem at Sasa Sushi. I ordered sushi rice for my daughter when she first took our order but all my food came out and 20-25 mins later I was still waiting on her food. The waitress also had a scowl on the whole time she served us. At first I was sympathetic because she and the only other server seemed overwhelmed but after a point it just became ridiculous, especially after I pointed out that their shrimp was rotting. Everything else was mediocre at best. I actually ordered so little that paying for AYCE was more expensive that if I'd done a la carte. I have no idea how this restaurant is still open... The service is horrible and the food ought to be illegal. I keep worrying whether I'll get food poisoning. I will never be back.",

Service: PHENOMENAL. I'd probably go back JUST for the service.   Food: the sushi was really bland. Didnt have enough flavor and rolls were not rolled tight so it fell apart. The pork belly appetizer was delicious, but it comes in many pieces so make sure not to over order because it does get heavy in your stomach. **They also offer one order of sashimi when you do the AYCE, but unfortunately we did not know about that until we were too full to eat any more.  That's really all I have to say about this place.",
