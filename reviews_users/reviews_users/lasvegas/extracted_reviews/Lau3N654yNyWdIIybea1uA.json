You get more bang for your buck and the servings are very generous.  The service was great, but I wouldn't expect any less from a place like this.  If you're in the New York Hotel/Casino I'd highly recommend Chin Chin. The most amazing chinese food ever.",

We split the Conchiglie al Pollo, which was a shell pasta served with chicken.  The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender, and by far the best part of the dish.  They skimped a bit on the sun-dried tomatoes and broccoli if you ask me.    The cannoli was great.  The dessert actually comes with 2 cannoli, perfect for sharing :)",

Our food was very slow to get to us. My meal was good but my friend who had a favourite dish there ended up with undercooked pasta. He has Italian family and is an amazing cook himself. He told server and the meal was reluctantly replaced. The next plate was marginally better but still under cooked. We told a manager who basically told us we didn't know what we were talking about. We are comparing it to how it normally comes!  Most of it was left uneaten and they didn't care. The sauce was good but the pasta was hard. A meal complained about and left uneaten but they charged us for it regardless!  The last over charged uncooked meal is the last money they will ever see from us. There are far too many great places to eat in Vegas to waste your time and money on this place!",

    "text": "Once upon a time, my dad and I stopped into this restaurant while driving home to Reno, NV from Texas. This was in 2004, and we both very much enjoyed our meals. I remember having a ridiculously delicious, rich pasta dish with seafood, and a decadent chocolate cake-thing for dessert.   Fast forward to this past month. Myself, my partner, and our best friend are roaming around before seeing a show at the casino, and I realize while I'm looking at this restaurant that it is the same restaurant my dad and I ate at years before. Remembering how much I loved it, we absolutely had to have dinner there before the show - even if the guys were skeptical.  I should have listened to them.  Although they were super nice and helpful (I'd hit my head pretty hard on the roller coaster, and they gave me water and let me just stand in the way at the entrance for about ten or fifteen minutes, nobody knowing if I'd pass out, before we finally decided to go in and eat there), and the fact that we were seated really quickly, I don't think I'd ever return to this place.  The prices are pretty high and the food is a bit mediocre. We ordered pizza because it's what the guys wanted, and although it wasn't bad, it was nothing to write home about. Since they're located in the New York, New York hotel/casino, we definitely expected a lot more from our pizza experience. Sad sad...  On top of the mediocre food disappointing me in comparison to my memories of how delicious things were before, the gentleman that we saw most often - a \"bus boy\", I think? - glared at us and made us feel as though we were children being GROUNDED. Every time he returned to the table, his demeanor and the way he moved things around (things were \"set\" down on the table very briskly and firmly, to say the least), he kind of barked at us, and was just overall unpleasant. Our waitress, however, was smiley and nice - all of the two times she made it back to our table. We even had to ASK for refills on water and coffee... which Cranky Mr. Bus Man splashed into our glasses, and promptly stormed away.",

Apparently this place has food that's pretty close to the real thing, and I took his word for it cause he knows his food.  Had the Italian sausage, and egg breakfast, and a double shot cappuccino. It was so simple, but perfectly cooked. The potatoes were nice and crisp, but tender on the inside. The sliced bread that came with the meal served nicely as a sponge for my over easy eggs. All in all a delicious breakfast. Next time I'll be back for dinner to try the pasta my friend was raving about all night.",

We ordered a creamy pasta and seafood risotto, plus an antipasto plate.  Everything was really so-so.  I ate it all because I was hungry, but I wouldn't go back there.  I wanted to love it, and I just didn't.    Suggestion: make a reservation if you go.  Convenient for watching Zumanity straight afterwards.  Set your bar low.",

Asked someone else by us if he could please grate some fresh parmesan and he looked like he wanted to die.   Besides that I thought that food was good. I liked the Minestrone soup the vegetables were delicious. And we ordered a super good pizza with prosciutto, arugula and freshly shaved pieces of parmesan (yum).   Next time I'm in Vegas.

Oh how I wish every restaurant served bread like you get at Craftsteak.  I got the veal with sliced artichokes with lemon and veggies with roasted potatoes.  Overall my food was enjoyable.  The tiramisu was good and I love me some italian espresso.  Unfortunately, they start blasting music from the bar in the middle of the casino floor which made our dining experience somewhat uncomfortable.    3 stars",

I went with my brother for lunch today, and it was just as wonderful as the one in Pasadena. We were seated promptly, served quickly, and enjoyed a great meal. I had the salmon salad, and my brother had the steak and eggs. The food was fresh (that's what I love best about Il Fornaio), portions were perfect, and the salmon and steak were to die for. Our server, Rosie, was professional, polite, and very warm. She answered our questions about the menu, served us, and then inquired if we were happy with the meal. We had gift cards and they were gladly processed. Even the manager came out to check on us, which I thought was a wonderful touch. Il Fornaio has always been my favorite restaurant brand, and I was not disappointed in any way. Keep up the great work. I hear there's another one opening in Summerlin in Las Vegas. Hooray, hooray (I live in Summerlin) :))",

Once he did, we communicated our disappointment and he did notify the manager, who discounted our meal and eventually came to apologize and offer us a free dessert, but by that time we were just ready to go.

    "text": "I LOVE Il Fornaio. It is my FAVORITE of the upper end Italian chain food restaurants. My husband and I enjoy dining here when we are in town staying at our timeshare because it is conveniently located inside the New York, New York Casino.  The restaurant is quite large, but we have never been inside. We always sit in their \"outdoor\" area which is off one of the main walkways of the casino. It's a great location to sit and people watch.  Our favorite way to order is via their regional menu.  This option gives you a 3 course meal for about $35 per person. You get an appetizer, a second course, and then your main meal. Dessert is not included.  Plan on your tab being around $100 with a glass of wine each and maybe a cup of coffee to top off the meal.  Here is a sample of the regional menu that is going to be offered in January 2017: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ilfornaio.com%2Ffesta%2F2017%2FCore-Lombardia-menu17.pdf&s=b27f41e6d7840e9ea61bbff1272da9440384e3837905121a98488a3d4a5c01e6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ilfornaio.com/festa/2017...</a>  Be sure to sign up for their \"passport.\" You will accumulate points each time you dine, and then you can redeem the points for free coffee, dessert, and appetizer or even a complete regional meal.  Anyway, as for this location the service is always perfect.  We were seated very quickly (which is what usually happens). We arrived at about 8:30pm.  Our waiter was wonderful. It turned out he was actually from Rome. So, it was great to have an \"authentic\" Italian serving us dinner and able to talk to us about the menu items.    My husband ordered the Branzino (which is sea bass). He loves sea bass, but wasn't crazy about this dish.  Not because there was anything wrong with it...He just didn't read all the ingredients and it seemed like everything on the dish, other than the fish, was not his cup of tea, but I thought is was WONDERFUL.. it was covered with tomatoes and kalamata olives and Sicilian green olives and some mushrooms. It was SO flavorful and delicious.  I ordered the salmon...It was good, It came with scalloped potatoes and some veggies. It was not as impressive as the Branzino, but still very good.  We also shared a wine flight that included 1/2 glass each of one red wine and 2 white wines..this was only $15, and the amount worked perfect for us.   As I said, I really love this place and it again did NOT disappoint.",

    "text": "**Review is only for BREAKFAST!  A solid 2.5 stars for food, but 5 stars for service and environment.   Came here with my parents and it felt like we were sitting outside in a nice little city! Such a great environment to dine at with great service.   Unfortunately, the food failed to even remotely impress us.. The best part of our meal was sadly the basket of bread in the beginning - warm, toasted deliciousness!   I don't remember the exact name of the items from the menu since they're all in Italian so....  //VEGGIE OMELET (1.5/5): literally so meh. The omelet was extremely thick, overcooked, and had no real distinct flavor, besides egg.. And cooked vegetables. We had to dump hot sauce and ketchup on it to make it more enticing to eat, but my mom still didn't finish it. Oh well. The potatoes were really good atleast!   //SMOKED HAM BENEDICT (2.5/5): This dish had a LOT of potential.... The cream-Parmesan sauce for the Benedict was addicting and the potatoes they served with it were crispy and perfectly seasoned. However, the eggs were overcooked, bread was too hard until I let it get soggy, and I had to soak everything in the cream sauce to make the Benedict taste good. The yolk didn't even spill out.....   //BUTTERMILK PANCAKES (3/5): Very meh. The pancakes were moist and not dry at all, but that was the only good thing about them. Besides that there was no defining flavor and the pancakes were a little too soggy. Oh well, atleast they didn't stick to the roof of my mouth like most other pancakes!   Overall, I don't know how the rest of the food is here, but I wouldn't come back for breakfast. Thanks for the great service and atmosphere though!",

The restaurant is always clean, and has an upscale feel, despite being in a casino. The food it a bit overprice, but it is Vegas, so you grow to expect that. My one concern about this place is the pasta dishes are a little too fatty. There is a right way and a wrong way of doing pasta, and I feel like Il Fornaio is trying to cover their pasta up rather than letting it shine. I had the manicotti, and it was just so-so. I wish the flavors were a bit more robust. What I will about Il Fornaioi is that their bread is unbelievably good. If you don't mind more sauce than pasta and a lot of bread to soak it up, you'll be fine. I read other reviews that complained about service and management, but I have not had those issues at all. This is a restaurant that has decent food, good ambiance, and not so great value for money.",

They make everything from scratch even the breads and pastry!  The best part is that it is always consistent and every time we go the food is prepared the sane way I was craving for!  They give great hospitality and even the chef Gianni at dinner and chef Massimiliano with Manager Marcello at breakfast, came to the table to say hi and make sure they gave some of their personable touch of their hospitality... We also went to the Bakery next door and had lots of great choices, excellent espresso from Italy, was a good pick me up snack in the afternoon, Grazie Mille!",

This place is an upscale Italian restaurant, with your usual food choices like pasta, pizza, etc.  We were seated right away, surprising for 9:30 on a Thursday night. There was good mood lighting, and I suppose this would be a good place to have a date.  They gave us bread upon seating and it was pretty damn good. Soft sourdough slices with some olive oil really hit the spot. Service was a bit slow throughout the night but we got our food pretty quickly.  Dinner:  Porterhouse steak- I know porterhouse isn't the best cut of beef you can get but damn... Im not a steak eater but this was good. It took my breath away. Buttery, smooth, flavorful. Made me a believer. I don't even know what to say...  Pollo Tuscan- Buttery and tender. Really good, light meal. Came with garlic/Rosemary potatoes and thin carrots. Solid meal. Personally, I would take the sourdough bread (see above) and shove some chicken in between...   Moving onto desserts:  Tiramisu- Top 5 best tiramisus I've had  Panna Cotta- This one is layered with strawberry and mango. It would've been better without the fruit but still good mixed with the mango.   Overall, a good experience here. I would recommend whether you're a local or a tourist.",

The omelette was wonderful - with grilled onions and thinly sliced potatoes and served with polenta topped with a bit of blue cheese.  Their bread is out of this world.  Since we were staying at New York, NY, we received a 2 for 1 breakfast special.  This \"freebie\" was the Il Fornaio con bruschetta.  Perfectly ripe and flavorful tomatoes chopped and seasoned and served on top of their wonderful bread, served alongside scrambled eggs and thinly sliced potatoes fried with onions.    Absolutely first-rate.  This was the best deal and the best breakfast we had in Vegas.  Unless you want to gorge yourself at one of the many breakfast buffets, I recommend Il Fornaio for a more simple, civilized breakfast served by highly attentive and efficient wait staff.",

For starters, the server brought out bread with olive oil. The bread was pretty good. For my appetizer, I had the flat bread and Caesar salad. I enjoyed both appetizers. The flat bread and Caesar salad were made to order and fresh.I had the Pennoni alla Vodka which was pasta tubes with applewood-smoked bacon, vodka-cream-tomato sauce and parmesan cheese. The Pennoni alla Vodka was delicious. I had tiramisu for dessert. I really enjoyed every bite of the tiramisu. The service was good. The waiter was attentive and really nice.Il Fornaio Panetteria has a romantic atmosphere even though it's in a hotel/casino.

Thinking ahead, she made reservations well in advance - and that was a welcome decision as we entered to discover the line around the corner. No issues for us - we gave our names to the hostess and were seated in less than 5 minutes.  The server greeted us and took provided water immediately upon seating. She returned with a basket of bread and butter soon afterwards. My friends each ordered a glass of wine and we shared an order of Calamaretti Fritti. For an entree one ordered Conchiglie al Pollo, the other Pennoni alla Vodka, and I the Barilotti alla Valtellina. Mine came in a bowl filled with whole wheat pasta, cabbage, potatoes, string beans, portobello mushrooms, Fontina and Grana Padano cheese, butter and sage. It was very good, but also very large. I ate about half of it and was finished. The price was good for that dish at 15.99. The other two dishes were $18.59 and 16.99, respectively.   All restaurants on the strip fill up quickly - especially on a weekend that featured the Las Vegas marathon, a bullriding championships and a country music award show - make reservations! The food was delicious and our service was very good. I would definitely be back.",

Prices are reasonable and service is good. Our server was particularly charming and helpful.  The food is pretty good. Not as good as you're going to get at a more high-end restaurant--but pretty darn good. I really enjoyed the bread and the minestrone soup. The main course was a swiss and prosciutto  ravioli. The flavor was a bit strong for me, but I loved the white mushroom sauce it was bathed in.",

    "text": "When I went to Vegas, a few people from my group of friends were raving about \"that Italian place\" they went to a couple months ago and could not imagine passing up during our stay. So I thought, all right, this sounds promising....  ...until we entered NYNY's Little Italy and saw it was Il Fornaio. Now, I had been to the Il Fornaio in Coronado and it was a horrible experience for me (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-coronado-2#hrid:ba8JuHA3NGLfZWqt9HWEcA\">yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-...</a>). I hurriedly warned my friends about the bad food and slow service for this place's chain, but they brushed me off by assuring me this is the best pasta in town.  Wrong. Although the service was not as slow as the one in Coronado, the food portions were super small. Because my friend and I knew we didn't want to spend $20+ for a pasta dish here, we had agreed to split, which made the already small portions even smaller. We had some linguine with vodka sauce and it was bland and meh. We each only got to eat around 3 small slices of sausage which were nothing special as well. I only left without remaining hungry because I'd decided to fill my stomach with their bread and dip to get my money's worth.  However, the worst part came when we were leaving Il Fornaio. While we were waiting for our credit card receipts, one of our friends was looking at the \"menu stand\" restaurants sometimes have outside for advertisement. Well, he accidentally knocked it over and we discovered what was behind the stand. There was a \"C\" rating for Il Fornaio's health inspection. WHAT?! I have NEVER been to a C-rated restaurant. And what's worse is that they even tried to hide it with their menu board. Wow, I felt like we had been scammed.   Il Fornaio, you have once again disappointed me. I will never get dragged to any of your other chains again, even if it means standing outside waiting for my friends to finish their food while my stomach grumbles in hunger.",

The cannelloni with chicken dish looked and tasted like it had been reheated.  A couple of the mushrooms in it were cold, and though the menu description mentioned bacon, there was none to be found.  The bruschetta was average at best, and didn't have any cheese on it.  And all of that food came out after the table beside us - seated 20 minutes after us - got their entrees.  WTH?  For shelling out $25 and dealing with the hoighty toightyness of the waiter who barely paid any attention to us, a lot more is expected.  I'd rather have munched on those awesome looking fish and chips at the fish fry place.",

Seemingly a good alternative to a buffet for breakfast, we stopped by and were seated quickly as it was a Monday morning and pretty dead. Our service was with us immediately...but that didn't last long.   But let's start with the positive - tasty Eggs Benedict. The yolks were perfect, the sauce was tasty. It came with some potatoes that were nice as well. It was a bit pricy, but that's to be expected. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs - omelets, french toast, etc. Nobody seemed blown away by theirs, but nobody really complained.   Now the reason for the two stars, despite the decent food - really, really slow service. Unacceptably so. It took 10 minutes to get our drinks, and refills required your offer of a first born child. Our server, while okay (but not great) as far as friendliness goes, was never around to show or provide much. And there were barely any tables sat. Food can't make up for service.",

    "text": "I have dined at II Fornaio at least 3 times in the last 5 years.  I've been here for breakfast and dinner.  You'll find the typical items on their breakfast menu like coffee, pastries, eggs, pancakes, and fruit.  Breakfast at II Fornaio is just okay and the portions are on the smaller side.  I recently dined here with my girlfriend and her cousins.  Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  It was a Friday night and that kind of stuff happens.  Once seated, we looked through our menus.  I was actually surprised that II Fornaio had a lot more than just Italian food for dinner.  Il Fornaio offers a pre fixe meal for about $30, which includes salad or soup, main entree, and dessert.  This is not a bad deal at all.  I wasn't craving Italian, steaks, or anything on their pre fixe menu. So, I ended up with their mixed seafood dish, the Grigliata di Pesce Misto for $30.95.  This meal includes salmon, seabass, calamari, scallops, prawns, potatoes, and broccolini.  This is one of those dishes that sounded good on paper and the portions were really small.  The bigger issue was that half of my dish was okay, while the other half wasn't prepared correctly.  The salmon and the seabass wasn't fully cooked.  Both were grilled on the outside and still raw on the inside.  I was starving and figured that it's no different than sushi.  So, I ate it and didn't even mention it.  The good news...the rest of the dish was cooked.    Overall, II Fornaio is just okay.  II Fornaio is not one of those places on the strip that I can't wait to come back to.  But I'll sure that I will be back because there will always be someone I know that wants to dine here.",

Had a charming waiter who could have passed for Italian but he said he was Mexican.  Our drink order was taken right away and we were given a basket of amazing bread and rolls along with oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  Could have made a meal on that alone.  We each had a salad in the interest of pretending to be healthy, and hubby had a pasta with tomato sauce and sausage and I had pasta with seafood and tomato sauce.  He said his was very good, I know mine was as well and large portions that neither of us could finish.    Alas we couldn't fit dessert anywhere in our tummies so will save that for another time.  The meal was affordable, a bit under $100 for drinks, dinner and a tip.  There is a Il Fornaio here in Seattle that we'll be certain to try.",

We were transported to the hospital because it was so bad we were getting severely dehydrated. We spoke with the management at the hotel who was kind enough to refund us for our room service but had told us they were a separately leased area. We spoke with management at the restaurant who did apologize but said that they would not take responsibility for it. Even though he admitted to us 6 months ago they had a report of food poisoning. So now we are going to be sent a bill that was not our fault and the management would only offer us a gift card to come back! Why would I want to eat there again if your food made me sick. They will definitely be hearing from our lawyers. Really disappointed considering they seem like a higher end restaurant and you would think they would be more helpful than a gift card.

Even though there were plenty of seating inside and outside, they made us wait 10 minutes before seating us.  After being seated, our server came and took our order.  I don't know if he had a bad day or what, but man... it was not a pleasant looking face.  I went with one of the specials of the day, which was a pasta with a creamy red bolognese sauce, ham, and peas.  I forgot the type of pasta but it was similar to gnocchi but not as heavy.  The creamy bolognese was absolutely delicious and went really well with the ham.  The sweetness of the peas added a nice dimension to the dish as well!  Had a bite of my coworker's lasagna and while tasty, it was one small lasagna...  While we liked the food, the service was not what we expected.  Our sever never cracked a smile and when we asked for more oil & vinegar for our bread, he forgot about it and we had to ask one of the busboys.  He didn't even sound pleasant until he brought the bill.  Probably wanted to sound nice at the last moment so we can tip well.  While we did tip the standard, we left a note for the manager.

The bartenders here were ok, but that doesn't make up for the food. Carpaccio was clearly presliced, covered with plastic wrap and placed in the fridge for serving. Pennoni alla vodka was oddly sweet and very generic tasting, like the worst recipes from the back of soup cans. The tiramisu was also pre portioned, I believe, since the chocolate shavings on top had the chalky look that they get from sitting in the fridge.   If you're in a large group looking for something to eat that's not going to offend anyone then I guess come here. If you're looking for something worthwhile to spend money on, then there are much better options close by.",

It's bad enough that a cool looking hotel and casino from the outside (talking about New York New York here) has absolutely NOTHING to do on the inside. This is one of the only restaurants in the entire place and it sucked. There was a line to be seated that was pretty long. We truly thought that the place was spectacular because of it. It was our friends wedding night and they wanted to get a good dinner as did we. This place is over priced (it's Vegas), portions are tiny and the food is BLAND!  Not to mention, our waiter was exceptionally rude. He didn't want to explain anything to us (seriously, reading that menu is like reading a foreign language), it took him 15 minutes to bring us our bread and oil and balsamic, and he did not once offer any refills (I was afraid to even ask in fear that they'd charge us for refills)  Avoid this place at all costs. I rather would have tried the Irish restaurant on the other side of the casino.",

The calamari was a hit with all of us and the sauce was great!  We asked about a kid friendly option as the menu is a little pricier and were told they could offer pasta with butter and cheese. Great!  The pasta was good, my daughter(9) liked it. Our scaloppine al carciofi was pretty good, (I was expecting better as I have eaten at this chain before). The meat was very tender but the dish didn't have a lot of flavor to it (I have had it before). The veggies were really good as well. Our bill came and I was shocked, the pasta (butter & noodles) for my daughter was $19.95!!  I asked the server and was told since we got a full portion and she ate half and we were taking the other half with us that they could not give us any discount!  They charged us the Penne al Vodka price and took the $3.95 apple juice off our bill. Pretty disappointed as I have eaten at several nicer restaurants and they offer a less expensive pasta option (and without the attitude). I realize I should have asked about the price for the \"kid friendly\" option OR the server could have told us but really, $19.95!  We won't be eating at this chain again, in any state.",

We were trying to have a romantic evening, starting off with some enjoyable conversation over a glass of wine, and I wanted so badly to yell at the kitchen to please shut the hell up.  After that, it was all hands on deck while they set up a table for fourteen next to us. I would have expected them to know enough to work quietly and not disturb the guests. But this crew was just the opposite--talking back & forth and laughing like a bunch of frat boys at a ball game. It completely changed Il Fornaio from up-scale Italian restaurant to no-frills Mexican tacqueria.  Don't get me wrong--that may be the atmosphere they're going for. But if you're looking to have a quiet romantic dinner, you may come away disappointed.",

Additionally, my poached eggs were over hard. I wish I would have been told prior to ordering. Keep doing what you're doing with potatoes because those were also very tasty.

I showed up crying and tired super late after a long drive from LA with a freaking big ass, 2-tier cake. Why? Because the freaking LA chef made this giant madness to impress the Hollywood guy.... anyway, the manager of the restaurant was an angel and trooper. They saved that giant monstrosity of a cake in their fridge until the dinner party (10 hrs afterwards) and then rolled it out in a giant ass cart.  I love these guys. They pulled off the impossible and saved my butt. The manager, God bless his soul. The staff.... I love them all.",

The wait staff is very attentive and friendly.  My husband and I shared Fradiavola pizza (mozzarella, tomato sauce, Italian sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, red onions, and spicy peperoncino oil) as well as the Capellini Al Pomodoro (angel hair pasta, chopped tomatoes, garlic, marinara sauce and fresh basil).  I'm not a big fan of spicy foods so I was hesitant for the pizza, it had a moderate spice to it and was absolutely delicious.  The Capellini was also very good.  The portions were large, the perfect amount for sharing with a little bit left over.  I don't think you will be disappointed going here.",

    "text": "We wanted to get out of the heat and find a place for lunch. Wandering around outside the New York, New York Casino, we didn't see anything that appealed. When we went inside and stumbled on Il Fornaio, we were grateful because we knew what to expect: we've eaten at their locations near our hometown. To our surprise, the restaurant was nearly empty at 12:30 pm. Our server was very friendly, although she reached out and patted my 5 year old son on the head, and I don't love it when people think touching someone else's kids is OK by default. Still, she meant well.  My wife got her usual, Insalata Di Bietole. That beet salad is very good and this visit was no exception. My son got a small-ish portion of plain penne, with marinara sauce on the side, so he was happy. I had minestrone soup and a caesar salad. Now, a few days later, I don't remember the taste or look of the food at all, which is about what I expect from Il Fornaio. The food is fine, nothing wrong with it, but nothing that you'll look back fondly upon later.  Il Fornaio only merits three stars from me because it's not worth going out of your way for. Still, I'd come back when I'm hungry and it happens to be convenient.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located in the casino of the New York New York Hotel/ Casino on the strip with options of dining inside or outside (in the casino).  My partner and I thought we'd give it a try mid week, with no need to make reservations.  The food was quite good for the price paid. Slightly classy Italian with decent selection of appetisers and breads. The serving sizes were perfect and we didn't require ice cream or coffee afterward.  ***HOWEVER, there were a few issues we had with our dining experience. The primary issue was with service. The restaurant was almost empty when we arrived and we were both told to \"wait outside and you will be seated immediately\"... What they didn't mention was that we had to wait for the floor staff to finish laughing amongst themselves before nothing to seat us.  Once finally seated we looked through the menu, chose our meals and twiddled our thumbs and yawned a few times before the waiter came back (20 minutes later) with water and the free bread we were meant to receive on arrival...? He had forgotten to get the oil and vinegar for the breads so we ordered our food and waited for our oil.  10 minutes later a lady who couldn't understand much english came along with the oil and poured it all over the place (yes, this was a language barrier issue - the oil was everywhere like a crime scene), and we spent a few moments giving the place a good wipe down in preparation for the meal.  The mains were actually quite timely once we disregard the other delays... Although I did spend a further 5 minutes figuring out where the restroom was in the casino (why the f*ck there wasn't one in the restaurant I will never know)..  As stated above the meals were fine......  Once we were finished we spent about 5 minutes staring into space yawning before we walked to the bar to ask for our bill. The bill eventually came along, it wasn't too bad.  Would I go there again? No. Was the food great? Yes. Do they need to sort out their staff? Yes. Did we tip them? HELL NO.",

    "text": "We come here quit often when we're in Las Vegas. Mostly for a good sandwich, sometimes for dinner.  We consider it one of the fewer locations on this part of The Strip where you can eat a decent sandwich. Meaning that not only the ingredients are fresh and the way it should be, but also the bread. It almost ressembles a proper Italian bakery.  In the little shop they serve sandwiches (dine in or out), pastries and small hot Italian dishes. All made from scratch. Unfortunately the coffee is not like Italians make it, but hey, this is Vegas baby! Not Rome.  Tip: you can ask for your sandwich to be pressed. If you do, make sure to  ask them to make it extra hot. We've noticed that if you don't the outside is very hot, but the inside is still cold. They serve really thick sandwiches.  Both in the little shop as in the restaurant the service is Italian. It doesn't bother us. Real American's might do.  Because of the prices, the Italian service and the coffee I'm not able to give five stars. For two sandwiches a hot tea and a fresh orange juice we paid almost $32. Even for Vegas stiff.  And excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes. English is not my fist language. And if that isn't bad enough, my Apple device keeps changing the words into 'proper Dutch'. Yes, you've guessed right, my first language.",

It was resting on the lemon like it was on vacation.   My cousin and I recoiled in horror. *cue gagging noises*   We were confused.. was this a joke? A bug this ugly looking could only be a practical joke right? Wrong!   We waved down our server and he looked disgusted as we showed him the bug. He whisked it away and informed us that his manager would be right over. Here comes the HILARIOUS part.   Manager: Hi, what can I help you with?  Me: Well. we found a hideous pregnant looking bug on our Carpaccio and now we feel sick.  Manager: Well I'm sorry you experienced that, but out food is 100% organic. It's  normal for bugs to fly around and land in our food occasionally.  Me: *shows \"manager\" picture  Manager: Yes, that's normal. We're organic.  WTF? Ok.. so my cousin and I decided to leave and the manager did NOT even offer a comp or another chance to try the restaurant at abother time. Shame on you. We left, full on bread.   Damn you guys.",

It was barely 930am & they were all out. They usually carry plain bagels & everything bagels. I remember people in front of me & behind me trying to order bagels, as well. Only to find out that they were all out.  I had the ham & cheese croissant with egg. It was a little disappointing. Too much cheese & egg... i was searching for ham inside. Definitely not enough chopped ham in the mix. I was expecting at least a layer or 2 of some thin ham slices but that's not the way they make it. Probably won't be ordering that again.  The crumb cake is good. I suggest it if they have it available.  Service is almost always friendly. Even when it's hectic... They need to not run out of bagels next time.",

He stopped for our drink order and successfully took our food order. Our food was brought to our table in a timely fashion by another server. We enjoyed our meal.   Our server walked by. Repeatedly.  He never asked  how the meal was. He never asked if we would like pepper or ground cheese on the salad. He never stopped. Not once. Close to 40 minutes had passed and our dirty dishes sat in front of us still.   My husbands meal came with desert so we anticipated the waiter returning with that if not with the check and to pick up our dishes.  Eventually we flagged him over and he picked up our dishes.  He brought my husbands desert and still never inquired about our meal and didn't offer me desert but my husband requested it.   He came back to the table and set down two plates and two tattered teaspoons and walked away without even making eye contact. As a footnote:  we both had cake for desert and neither of us typically eat cake with teaspoons.   Overall the experience was at the very bottom of average if I were being generous.",

    "text": "We only came here for breakfast because when we checked in to the New York, New York Hotel, the concierge told us it was buy one get one free breakfast about three times. We misunderstood that to mean it's one free breakfast per one paid breakfast. Wrong. It's one free breakfast per room with the purchase of another breakfast. We were seated quickly, since it wasn't too busy, but it was a very, very long time before we got our server's attention. Three more tables were seated near us, and about four servers walked by before we were told she'd be with us soon, and then we had an even longer wait, and we almost left. But, we finally flagged her down and ordered drinks and food.  Our water came out, but they had \"ran out of straws\" when I asked the guy that brought them over. Our server did do a search and found us some. Much appreciated. But, it didn't make the food better:  -Bread for the table: came with breakfast, but it was burnt. I don't mind burnt toast, but it was cold and thick and was like chewing buttered rocks -Crepes: a little thick for crepes, but good -Hash and poached eggs: tolerable-real hash -Cheese Polenta side: Texture was spongy and extremely off-putting -Scrambled eggs: Can't mess up eggs, so these were fine -Side of bacon: incredibly burnt.  -Vanilla cappuccino: good/not too sweeet -Eggs Benedict: pretty good! Good flavor, cooked properly -Potatoes side: Horrible. Unseasoned and overlooked to the point I thought a poker chip may have fallen in to my breakfast  They are trying to be an upscale restaurant, but have completely missed the mark.  They get two stars for being clean and for serving us some edible food. We did not go back for our \"one free breakfast per room with the purchase of another breakfast\" the next day.",

The calamari and spicy tomato sauce was as good as any calamari that I've ever had. The beet salad was excellent--the beets were sweet and the lemon olive oil dressing was the perfect dressing. The linguine was full of seafood-- shrimp, scallops, mussels, and clams. I couldn't eat all of it including lots of the seafood,but my son finished off what I couldn't. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

I ordered the $15 meatballs from the happy hour menu, and they served four golf-ball sized meatballs on an oversized plate. I guess I showed up for $4 per meatball day. Then I ordered a pepperoni pizza from the happy hour menu for $20. It was only a 12-inch pie. It was decent but nothing special. My wife and I ordered several beers and some mixed drinks during our visit. The Maestro drink is $13 each! An Irish coffee cost us $12 each. Somehow, our total bill came to $233! I had no idea how incredibly expensive this restaurant would end up being! Our server, Jessica, was nice and attentive. Still, as a local, this Strip's 'happy hour' menu is more expensive than Olive Garden!",

I wasn't thrilled with the place although the service was great and we got seated straight away.  I ordered one of the daily specials which was pasta with seafood, I really should have taken a pic of the name but see photo below. The pasta was pasta and the sauce almost tasteless. The seafood mixture was great though, the shrimp and white fish were quite fresh for the price and being in a city not next to the ocean. Might have been smart of me to order extra sauce, since it seemed quite a dry dish.  The service though, I have no complaints. Although the restaurant seemed full we were seated right away. I was a bit worried since I didn't make reservations on a Saturday night, right before a concert but we were handled promptly. I'm not saying to not do reservations because I have always been a stickler for resies, I think we just lucked out! Our servers were very prompt and friendly, attending to our needs. I think they could also see we were on a time constraint but that did not stop the great service!   Would I go hear again? Good question. Probably not but if I were to go to the T-Mobile arena for a concert again... It's worth the consideration to try another dish.",

We ended up getting the fried calamari for starters, the seafood rissotto and seabass along with a taster menu that included lobster bisque, pasta with meatballs and lamb chops. Everything was good, the lamb and the seabass stood out among these dishes. Not bad from inside a themed resort, prices are a little more expensive but the food will satisfy.",

A few examples:   First, ordered regular coffee -- not espresso, cappuccino, etc. It was decent for being bulk coffee, so far, so good. After the first cup, it went downhill. Ordered a couple pastries to share while we waited. The small plates that were brought to use were wet, which if course wasn't apparent until after we had the pastries divided. Pools of water and anything, you know, bread-like don't mix. Take it away.   Next up was the omelette with bacon and potatoes. A small amount of the bacon was ok, however the majority of it was burned beyond anything edible. The potatoes had more variety; they were either burned to a lesser degree or barely cooked through with no color, and not flavor to match. Eggs were cooked fairly acceptable, but lacked flavor. In fact, aside from the burned bacon flavor, the entire dish lacked much flavor at all.   Another breakfast on the table was scrambled eggs, with requested vegetables in it, which I'm certain the waitress did not understand so decided to literally ignore. Instead she brought \"salad fruit\". Thank you. Now take it back and bring what was ordered.  Summary: very mediocre service, horrible culinary skills, and an all around sense of apathy. To be fair, they recognized that I was not pleased and removed some amount or other from the bill, which was welcome, but really need to fix the fundamental problems.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for a convention this weekend and came here with a big group (14 people). We were seated for dinner at a long table in what's usually the bakery, but we were able to order from their regular menu. We were served complimentary bread while we looked over the menu, and we also ordered drinks. I got an alright pomegranate martini for about $14.  After glancing over the prices for their regular menu items (between $17 and $28 for various kinds of pasta) we were informed of a $30 dinner special they were offering as a part of Restaurant Week. $4 would go to charity and it was a great selection of food as well - the $30 included an appetizer (minestrone, flatbread, or salad), entree (chicken, vodka sauce fettucine, or salmon), and dessert (tiramisu or zabaione with berries). Most of my group went for the $30 offer, including me.  The minestrone was well-seasoned, warm, and filling. It was appropriately portioned as well. I wish I had gone with the salmon instead of the chicken, but it turned out to be well-cooked and juicy with some nice potatoes on the side. Wasn't too big a fan of the quickly-sauteed spinach that served as the bed, though. The zabaione was a nice way to end the meal - nice and light after a pretty heavy dish.  In my opinion, an Italian restaurant should either be super affordable and homey-tasting, or more expensive/splurgy but worth it in quality and innovation. This place didn't do either. I can't say I'd spend $30 here when my company wasn't paying for it (haha) but it was an okay experience nonetheless.",

Quality control in this busy place is amazing. But the food is done extremely well and by Vegas standards, for a reasonable price. You really can't get better Italian in Vegas. The same company owns Canaletto in Venetian Hotel. Same dishes but at much higher prices.  I went again 9-11-14 and found a waiter who's an expert sommelier. Great food, reasonable price again.",

I long loved the location in Marin County, but the Vegas venue lacks the ambience and open brick fireplace and rusticity. We dined here as part of a before theater package to see Zumanity, and got a great deal, a fifty dollar meal credit.  The waiters were prompt, since we told them we were going to see Cirque. The meal was decent, great Olive oil with the bread, a decent salad, and well cooked linguine with seafood, but the restaurant was a bit noisy, and not as relaxing as a True Italian eating experience should be. Still one of my favorite elegant Italians, but not my favorite venue.",

DRINKS: I ordered a glass of Sangiovese. I normally love Sangiovese, but I didn't even want to finish the glass. My mom got a cocktail with limoncello, which wasn't too bad. Overall: B  FOOD: I ordered soup and their salad special that day (cucumbers, \"fresh\" tomatoes, onions, red vinaigrette, and feta). The salad was terrible. I thought it had marinated tomatoes at first, but then realized it had just been sitting pre-made in a fridge for awhile -- the tomatoes were that ice-cold. I ended up picking at it, but not eating it. My mom got the rare veal ($30+), and she also ended up barely eating it because it was just way over-marinated. It still had a vinegary taste to it. I normally love all red meat, and even I didn't like it, so she wasn't just being picky. Overall: D  SERVICE: Our server didn't come ask us how the meal was until we were pretty much done picking at it 30 minutes later. Admittedly, when she realized we didn't like the food, she did have one of her superiors come talk to us, who offered to get us something else. We didn't have time for something else, so they didn't charge us for the salad or the veal.  Overall: C",

After waiting for at least 20 minutes she finally asked for our order.   After about half an hour later, we finally got our food. It was not worth the wait.

Just a heads up, if you have a party, they will not seat you until your entire party has arrived. So we sat down, the waiters were uber friendly.  And let me apologize because I didn't take one pic smh.  I checked in but w everyone talking, I just forgot. Back to the food.  I ordered the 3 course meal.  I chose the salad, Petto di Pollo which was grilled chicken and a few potatoes and spinach.  The chicken really had NO seasoning.  I was  very disappointed.  My friend ordered the salmon under the 3 Course Meal along w the salad and cheesecake.  She said it was definitely not as good as the first time so that stunk.  But the Moscato was everything and more.  The waiter said it was their House Moscato and could be purchased for $39.  I got the name and I knew it tasted familiar.  Total Wine here I come lol. Overall, 3 stars for the atmosphere and the wonderful staff but the food is just ok.  Maybe the pasta is better?!?!",

It was not bad, mind you, but it also was not exceptional like other Italian restaurants in the area.  It was also pricey, but considering it overlooked the casino and was directly on the strip, a price hike is expected.  I ended up having a caesar salad and chicken fettuccine alfredo, and shared some red wine with my dining party.  The food was filling and the alfredo sauce was very solid, but nothing blew me out of the water.    There are in fact better Italian restaurants for the same price on the strip.  There are truly better Italian restaurants off the strip for better prices if you want to venture out.  I would recommend taking the 10-15 cab ride off the strip to a local Italian establishment rather than settling here, but if you really need to eat at Il Fornaio it would not be your worst meal in Vegas.",

    "text": "Ate here my first night in Vegas. I was tired and very hungry, and Il Fornaio just didn't do it for me. I got the $33 dinner menu and it was simply a waste of my money. You had a few choices for appetizer, entree and dessert. I had Rustichella for my appetizer and it wasn't too bad, salmon for my entree and it was subpar - it had no taste, and of course I ordered Tiramisu for my dessert and it was terrible. It's as if they bought the box kind and left it out of the freezer for way too long. Judging by other reviews, maybe I should've gotten something more expensive to enjoy my dinner, but why offer a lower price dinner if effort won't be put in into making it??",

You have to pay for parking and walk through the cigarette smoke to get to the restaurant, and you can even smell the smoke in the restaurant. They have fewer gluten-free choices than the one at home. And to top it off, the shellfish in my meal was undercooked. I sent it back and they fixed it, but undercooked shellfish is dangerous. Everyone else's dinner seemed to be fine, but we should have gone to one of the many restaurants off the Strip.",

    "text": "Came here on the day we arrived in Vegas, while waiting for out hotel room to be ready. We were just wandering around and saw this place and thought we would give it a try. The bread they bring out is pretty good. They fresh slice what tasted like a sourdough which was tasty, then there was another type of bread with olives in it which was also yummy. But then for some reason there was bread covered in sesame seeds and it didn't quite seem to fit. We just didn't eat it, so no big deal.  We ordered the calamari as a starter and a pizza as our entree. VERY small portion. You get about 6-9 rings and like 3 tentacles (which I don't eat anyway). The calamari pieces were MUCH too thick and not only that, but they were REALLY chewy. Not how I want my calamari to be. I wouldn't recommend this dish to anybody. My boyfriend and I order calamari everywhere we go but it just wasn't good here. Also, they don't have cocktail sauce which I understand cause it's an Italian place, but I prefer cocktail sauce over marinara with calamari.  The pizza came out and it was pretty good but really greasy. I forgot what the one we ordered was called but it had italian sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and a few other things I think. It was decent. Not amazing and not bad either.   The service was good, place was empty around 1 on a Saturday but our server was very kind. Bill was 30 dollars for a pizza (15$) and an appetizer (12$)",

I had the pennoni all vodka which was amazing and he had the ravioli alla lucana which I tried some of and it was also pretty good. We had been given a coupon for a free dessert when we made our reservation so we had the Rosina al Cicolatto which was very rich and decadent. Service was very professional and prompt. Only complaint was our server was difficult to find at the end of our meal when we were trying to settle the bill. He had accidentally brought us another tables bill. Other than that no complaints and will definitely return again in the future!",

Yes, we only did have breakfast here, but it was fantastic.  The BF had eggs, toast, bacon, potatoes.  He loved everything.  I had: Italian corned beef hash, which was huge chunks of corned beef served on a bed of fried potatoes, two poached eggs, and instead of toast, crispy polenta with gorgonzola cheese easily melting on top.  DELISH.  I love corned beef hash.  I LOVE polenta.  I LOVE gorgonzola!  My only complaint is that the eggs were poached a little over.  I enjoy a runnier yolk.

He was helpful and I enjoyed the meal. I had the cholesterol free eggs with basil, lowfat cottage cheese, fruit salad, and an espresso shot with brandy (not sure the Italian name but it's the only coffee w/booze) The eggs were great...but I think anything with basil is amazing. The espresso was INCREDIBLE. I mean INCREDIBLE. We live in the era of Starbucks so anytime you can have real espresso pulled by hand, it's such a treat.  Dinner was awesome. Only issue was that the minestrone wasn't great :( I got the seafood sampler with calamari, prawn, scallops, grilled polenta, and veggies - a cool $27 but GOOD. Hubby got fettuccine alfredo - nothing spectacular. Dad got the calzone - said it was good and it was very large.  The best part about the meal was the waiter - wish I could remember his name so I could give him proper recognition. He was witty and friendly without being too familiar, and kept us laughing and entertained throughout the whole meal. You don't generally experience genuinely good service like this anymore, especially in Vegas, so it's quite welcome when it happens :)  Overall, good. If you don't want to spend a lot, you don't have to. If you want to, you can. Lots of options :)",

I go here with groups of people for a birthday dinner or what have you.  With my mom.  For those sorts of reasons.  That being said, this Il Fornaio, located in the revitalized New York, New York casino, was not crowded at all (for sunday brunch) and everything was very passable.  Main complaint is that my eggs benedict had eggs that were not runny at all, while a fellow diner at my table ordered her eggs \"over medium\" and got them \"over easy.\"  So they basically messed up the only two things you can mess up about those two orders.    But whatever- I can think of lot worse places to eat, and both the prices and portion sizes were reasonable (i.e. smaller portions)",

Another friend got some chicken dish and I had the Ravioli alla Lucana which was fresh organic spinach ravioli filled with Italian sausage, ricotta, parmesan and fennel; fresh tomatoes, spicy tomato sauce with imported peperoncino, pecorino pepato cheese and fresh basil* *Courtesy of their website. lol I remember really enjoying my dinner. I think the portions were a little on the smaller side but then again it is Vegas so it is expected. We sat outside in their little patio which was really nice and made me feel like I was Jersey Shoring in Italy. Fun times. Then the cabs were here so we had to bounce. Cio, grazie.",

The two stars are for the staff, which was very friendly, and the atmosphere.  We sat on the \"patio\" inside the casino and people watched while we had this dreadful food.",

I've been to Vegas a ton and know what to expect, but this one threw me for a loop.  For an appetizer we had the fried zucchini and onion rings. I liked that. Interesting that they gave us tartar sauce.  My entree was the vodka sauce which was bland. I asked for crushed red pepper and they gave me black pepper.  The diet coke had a bandaid taste to it. That was odd.  A plus here is people watching.",

He said the only place he'd really recommend is Il Fornaio; otherwise, he advised us to take the walkway to MGM. Due to the weather, we opted for Il Fornaio. We got waters & the bread/olive oil- it took at least 20min to get the balsamic & straws to go with. The appetizer came out in decent time & was pretty scrumptious. It then seemed to take forever to get our entree orders in. When we got them, they were so scalding hot that we had to wait another 15min to dig in. Neither dish- at 18.99/ea.- was impressive. &, once again, our waiter was MIA. From finishing our food to the next time we saw him was another 15-20min so we were afraid to order dessert, since we were now cutting it close on time. Which we told him. Which he acknowledged so he got our bill in a much more timely manner. Then disappeared again! A good 15 more min went by before someone came to fetch our plastic to pay. Atmosphere: bland. Service: sucks. Food: lackluster. Seriously, just eat at Nathan's hotdogs upstairs.",

The pasta and sauce was NOT heavy and over filling. I could have eaten the whole thing myself and  not worry about popping.  LOVED it.

The portion seemed small, but that's only compared to all the huge meals restaurants always provide. It was the perfect amount.   2 people in my group got pizzas. Both were very good as well. One pizza is plenty for one person, but good for two people with bread or an appetizer.   Last person in my party got seafood. I didn't ask how it was but he ate it all.   The one that ate the seafood got sick about 6 hours later. I tried both pizzas and the pasta and I was fine. The other two people were fine. We all shared the same lunch before that so it wasn't any other food we had. Deductive reasoning points towards Il Fornaio.   Great food, but only 2 stars because of food poisoning   -Update-  The general manager contacted me to ask further questions. They had many others order that dish the same night with no other reports of sickness. Take that info how you will. At the very least I appreciate the concern and customer service.",

Their house red wine here was also a bargain and was very nice. Service I would say was the best.

When we were seated we inquired about the happy hour and were told it started in a few minutes...they seated us at a table and then told us it was only available at the bar. We opted to move into the bar and they were happy to move us. They should have just seated us there to start since they knew we were coming for HH.   All the food was delicious. Our waitress did spill a drink all over my mom and we didn't get anything more than an apology. Wish we could enjoy our food without the smoke...but I guess that's Vegas! Not sure I would come here and pay full price, but the happy hour is a definite winner!!!",

I was seated and this nice man comes and takes our drink order and give us a basket full of delicious warm bread with an olive oil and balsamic dish. Yum! He takes out orders and we order the spaghetti Bolognese and this pasta dish with duck... it was over priced but delicious .. then again it was NYE so menu prices were overly inflated my dish was 30$ the duck pasta dish was almost 40$  the dessert was really good as well. We had the soffiato al cioccolato. It was an almond hazelnut cake, served warm with sea salt gelato .. yummmmm so worth the $11.50.. everything else was relatively affordable.  I like that they don't rush out out the door. You can enjoy a proper dinning experience here. Just prepare to spend a lot.",

Everything about it was so flavorful and delicious. We ended our stay with a slice of cheesecake. It was so dense and creamy, so so good. The sauce on the side was delicate and bright tasting.

Service was wildly slow, and considering there were fewer than ten tables of guests at any give point during the entire time we were there, yeah service was lacking. No excuses, this was the worst. Took us way too long to even be acknowledged by a server who never really greeted us. More of \"here's bread. what do you want. k. brb\" kind of service. There was also a busser who never said a word and a runner who more or less rolled his eyes when food hit the table. Really not great.  And the food isn't doing it any favors either.  We started with the calamari, which is Italian for salty octopus parts (or at least from my experience here, it must be). The tentacles are always my favorite and they were overly crispy to the point of being burned. There wasn't much redeeming about it.  Then after the salty sea, we split the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were the tiniest meatballs I've ever seen, and in comparison the ikea meatballs were WAY more juicy and meaty. So I mean, like, it's do-able, I just don't get why this restaurant couldn't keep up. C'mon guys, step your game up. Our server could not care less about us and I could not think less of the food. Just overall, avoid this. Not good.",

Oh, and just a couple of warnings: as you might suspect, since this restaurant is attached to a casino (it's in the New York, New York casino), expect to experience your breakfast as fumes of cigarette smoke encase you. Nasty! Also, expect to pay wayyyy to much for brekky that tastes JUST okay.",

It turns out that the \"bar\" is more of a glass washing station than bar, and there was a consistent flow of dirty glasses being passed across the counter next to me and placed directly in front of me until the clean glasses were finished.  Then the \"bartender\" would noisily unload the dishwasher with all the glasses and hurl the next batch in.  Very unappetizing.    I sent my Caesar salad back because it had no dressing.  I prefer light dressing but there was really none.   Then I took a bite of my pasta and found something crunchy.  Turns out it was eggshells.  How it got there, no idea.

We were staying at the MGM and the restaurant is conveniently located in New York, New York (i.e., just across the street).   Our party of six was seated on the \"outdoor\" patio adjacent to the casino floor. Slot machines were literally about 15 feet away. Not the best ambiance for a nicer restaurant.  As for the food, it was decent but nothing too exciting and largely overpriced. While my margarita pizza was much larger than I expected for $14 and easily enough for two meals, my friend's salmon plate seemed incredibly tiny for $25. Would it really hurt you to throw in a little extra sides? Maybe it's just because I'm crazy for potatoes but the few little bites on the plate wouldn't have satisfied me.  On the plus side, the waiter was pleasant and the complimentary bread and olive oil/vinegar was a nice touch.",

On the one hand: their happy hour is AMAZING. $7 pizzas, appetizers, wines, beers. brightly lit bar area, friendly service, perfect cheap dinner (and seriously...why is it so hard to get a reasonably priced dinner in vegas that is NOT a buffet??)   Then...i went back for lunch a day later. ok, so it was really nice sitting out on their cute little \"patio\" and having a lunch date with my good friend. but...overpriced sandwich thing that consisted of dried up twirly sausage things and a side of fries...didnt quite meet the mark. the sausage was very strange...very dry and salty and rather tasteless...didnt go well with the bread at all....  anyway, DEFINITELY go to their happy hour. no other time. just happy hour. and enjoy a glass of wine or two.",

My appetizer which was the rustica flatbread was great, my chicken entree was good it hit the right spot with the spinach. My major disappointment wax on their tiramisu. It was heavy and not very good! I've had much better here locally in El Paso at Orange Peel pastries. But overall it was a decent meal.",

I never even had a chance to ask for more coffee or water. If you want a 5 dollar cup of cold coffee and NO service this is a place to check out. The food isn't bad tho. They weren't busy at all so I don't sympathize for the lack of service. I wouldn't go back.",

I have visited this location on two separate dates over the past ten years and both times the experience was dismal. While the food is passable (the noodles seem to be fresh and the bread is quite good), the service is what makes this place so awful.  The first time I visited was with a group of friends before attending a concert across the street at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. They didn't seem too busy and the wait wasn't long so we all agreed to eat there.  I ordered a standard alfredo, the sauce was great as well as the noodles. A friend of mine asked for Dr. Pepper and the waiter informed us, \"We don't carry Dr. Pepper, this is Las Vegas.\" (Possible he didn't know we were all local and well-aware that Dr. Pepper is indeed readily available in Las Vegas).  About ten years later, my boyfriend and I went for our first anniversary dinner. I again stuck with the alfredo, but it arrived with chicken. I hate sending food back, but being vegetarian, I had to. The waiter brought back the plate with the chicken on it and insisted that's what I had ordered. I let him know that I haven't eaten meat in over 15 years, so I was pretty sure I hadn't ordered chicken. He scoffed and asked if it was okay if he just removed it. I politely declined.  Two times in ten years...nothing changed. The last time was really the last time.",

So when New York New York gave me a coupon book upon checking in, I did my best to rifle through it cover to cover. Il Fornaio was one such restaurant that was featured.   Rather than hitting the proverbial buffets and end up overeating, I tried Il Fornaio for breakfast. It was a very quaint set up as it resembled an outdoor cafe with their tables underneath huge patio umbrellas. The food selection was rather extensive and everything looked good! Our server was very cordial and attentive which set the mood. The complimentary bread basket was pretty amazing.   We ordered a (huge) bowl of oatmeal and a veggie omelet, both were very good, tasty, and filling. I really like the abundance of vegetables in my omelet and it was cooked just right: not too \"runny\" and not burnt!   My overall impression of ll Fornaio is very positive. Though it's inside the New York New York casino, it gave me the \"outdoor patio\" ambiance. Our server was great and I won't hesitate about returning. Pricing was reasonable for a hotel restaurant...just make sure to use the coupon!",

I ordered the Cannelloni con Pollo, which was decently sized, but was very bland, with WAY too much cheese.  I'm a fan of cheese, I understand the Italians are, too, but the cheese totally overpowered the sauce, which is a definite no-no in my book.  Oh yeah, marinara sauce?  Absolutely not!  All I could see was white.  Nothing marinara-y about it.  I ate a few bites willingly, and the rest I pretty much had to choke down, for the sole reason that I was paying close to 20 bucks for it, and was not ready to leave with this in a doggy bag to be finished later.    Atmosphere of the place is nice- it's right across from The Bar @ Times Square, so you can enjoy the old school piano songs while you dine.  They're a rowdy, loud, drunk bunch over there, which makes for interesting entertainment.  In a word- yuck.  Sorry, NYNY.  You've done better.  Il Fornaio gets two stars- 1 for the convenience of being at the hotel I happened to be staying at while in Vegas, and 1 for keeping me from starving to death in the wee hours of the night.  Even though the meal made me want to gag.",

(We block him in from walking around :)) the waiter we had was very attentive and made a few non alcoholic drink selection for my son and 14 year of daughter. (He wanted a strawberry in his drink). The bread basket came our nice and warm with a plate full of olive oil and vinegar. My husband ordered Bistecca alla fiorentina, medium rare. Let me say this was a nice thick cut T-Bone steak! It was cooked perfectly, we were really impressed with the spinach and potato's. They were delicious, my husband normally doesn't eat spinach, however he was not wanting to share. My daughter decided to have seafood and ordered the Grigliate di Pesce mistro. I wasn't really impressed with this dish, The fish was very good however the calamari  and scallop seemed a little rubbery. I decided to order linguine mare chiaro. It was full of seafood and comes with a really tasty red sauce. The waiter suggested you can order it spicy and non-spicy I ordered spicy and to me it wasn't spicy at all. With three dinners and four nonalcoholic drinks our bill came out to $120 without tip. For what we ordered I feel like it wasn't bad at all, well worth it. I would definitely go back and try their pizza because the people next to us ordered four pizzas and they look delicious.",

So we end up eating here because it's the only place that had food chicks eat. I opted for the spaghetti with meat sauce and angel hair. It was a chili type which surprised me, but it was absolutely delicious. The price was $40 for 2 people which I think is way under-priced. My wife is super picky, almost to the point of obnoxious, and she was raving about it. I wish I hadnt washed my hands, while I was up the bread came and the rest of the party ate most of it. It was delicious and I only ate it plain. You dont need to be dressed up to eat here, I seen people who look like they just came from the County fair and they got the same great service. If I had to absolutely nit pick this place, and find something wrong I'd say the cigarette smoke from the casino if you're sitting on the \"outside\" of the restaurant. It's not literally outside, its just the way its built its not in the main part. And it wasnt even bad. I recommend this place entirely. We followed it up with a show across the street called Ka. It's my next review.",

This is not \"American\" Italian food so if you like Olive Garden, this place isn't for you.  Two appetizers to knock your socks off - the Carpaccio, and Polipo Con Patate! Yeah, you have to like raw beef for one and octopus for the other, but you are in Vegas baby, try something different.  Delicious Cioppino (Tuscan-style fish soup with monkfish, seabass, mussels, clams, scallops, prawns, tomato and herbs).  Very good Fiadoni Di Pietro (salmon stuffed spinach ravioli) - the saffron sauce was awesome.  Well - obviously I like Italian seafood. If you are one of those people who is stuck on Italian food being heavy cheesy, pasta with sauces - branch out a little and try the seafood. You'll be pleasantly surprised - especially in Las Vegas!",

Only one person claimed the Pasta was edible and actually ate it.  The other 3 pasta's had so much salt, it was ridiculous.  I'm a salt addict and I couldn't eat it.  I had to eat the bread with it because I couldn't eat the pasta by itself, it was so salty.    The Il Fornaio in downtown San Jose closer to where I live is much better.

Which is very convenient if you're staying there, or on that end of the Strip.  But because it's in the middle of a casino, it's also very loud.  Half the seating is basically on the casino floor.  So you see every drunken idiot walking past you, playing the slots, etc.  Very loud too given that you can hear all the machines and music from other venues nearby.  The service and Il Fornaio was excellent once we were seated.  Started off with appetizers of calamari and bruschetta, which were both very good.  People also said the caesar and caprese salads were great.  I kept it simple and went with the angel hair pasta - which I thought was really solid.  They have a full bar and an extensive wine list.  Prices are extremely reasonable too - especially given its location.  Everyone in our group left happy and full.",

Bar and coffee beverages are expertly prepared, the spinach salad is fresh and tasty. The Salute is a great healthy option for breakfast with eggs, cottage cheese, and fresh fruit. My husband got the French toast which came with whipped marscapone cheese. You always get fresh bread, served warm. Excellent place!",

We were sat immediately, but waited at least 10 minutes before we were acknowledged. The waiter  didn't acknowledge that we had been sitting for a while when he finally approached us to take our drink order. When he brought my coffee he didn't bring  sugar and we had to get our own sugar off of another table. Same with the food- the food was practically thrown on the table drive-by style and nobody checked on us at all after the food was dropped, until they dropped off the bill. The mascarpone french toast was tasty but luke warm. My girlfriend ordered the Contadina omelette, specifically for the gorgonzola cheese (which didnt end up making its way into her omelette). She also had to get hot sauce and ketchup from another table.",

In fact, their food is quite good. And the bread is to die for. But a place whose name translates into \"the baker,\" literally, should have good bread!   I had never had breakfast at Il Fornaio before, so my boyfriend and I decided to eat here one morning while we were staying at New York New York. I loved the Italian flare on American classics. The omlette ai formaggi was delicious! Can't beat the setting inside the casino either. This place is charming",

Had the bruschetta, they drizzled it with a sweet sticky balsamic reduction which was way too sweet it overpowered the tangy properties of the balsamic.  It had such little mozzarella cheese that we literally had to search for it.  The pizza was ok, but the dough was undercooked.  There was a bus boy/man that was so aggressive in taking our plates (when we weren't done, we had to block him).  He would stop at our table multiple times while we were having a conversation and start to take plates, and we were thinking \"really?\"  you need the plates that bad, \"really?\"  For the prices they charged you would think a little bit more effort would be put into the food.   Go elsewhere.  The food isn't worth the price.  Thank God we didn't have to wait because we'd be really kicking ourselves.",

The Food- WOW! from all the dishes i saw, they all looked excellent.  I sampled (Cannelloni con Pollo )The chicken stuffed cannelloni was delightful. I had the Pennoni alla Vodka; Large pasta tubes with applewood-smoked bacon, vodka-cream-tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese ....WOW!! Yes BACON!! it was beyond great!  They have a great Wine list and after dinner drink list. This is a Italian restaurant so they have Espresso and other coffee drinks. NUTSHELL- We will defiantly eat there again when in Vegas!

This comes baked rye and sesame bread. Ask them if they can heat it up b/c mines was served cold. :/ Anyways, I suggest to choose the flatbread as your starter (it has fresh mozzarella and goat cheese along with tomatoes and olives which was real good). You may also choose their soup or salad. Soup is very small. My main course meal was the pasta with vodka sauce (red sauce and cream sauce). However, it was okay, the bacon in it was good but for the price I say order the salmon with veggies instead. The highlight of the three-course meal was the tiramisu! It is made in their restaurant, so it tastes fresh! If you like chocolate, their chocolate mouse is the bomb.   This is located inside of the New York New York hotel on the Vegas strip and when parked (love how most hotels have free self-parking) you go down the escalator from the arcade and it is on your right side near the casino.",

Loved the polenta and potatoes that accompanied our breakfasts. Wasn't crazy about the corned beef. Pretty chewy. The service was very good. And as hotel guests, we got a really good deal.  Came back for dinner. Dinner was very nice. Started with Caprese Caldo, and it was nicely done. My companion had the veal scallopini, which was served with True baby carrots, Yukon gold potatoes, and broccoli. It was good. I had the Canneloni and it was excellent. I haven't had this dish in years, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert, we ordered Zabaione, which is hard to find. It is served with fresh berries, and was quite delicious, and a nice light finish. The cappuccino was also excellent. Our server was a charmer. All in all, an excellent meal.",

The service could have been more attentive and more caring, they also did nothing special for my celebration. I had the Cristina pizza and my boyfriend had the 3 course meal with a flatbread appetizer, pica chicken & the cheesecake (prettier names on the menu) but all delicious. Also we shared the fried calamari and I would definitely recommend it, light and delicious. My parents and siblings also enjoyed their meals! Tuscan lemonade was also a great drink to cheers for my 21st!",

They do tend to get long lines, at main dining times. So I suggest come early or much later to be able to get right in, to eat.",

Waited almost 10 minutes before we were acknowledged. Just looking for a Hi or Welcome be right with you. Not immediate Service. The table attendant greeted us but might have had a challenge with the menu or english or both. Went to ask Server who finally came to our table. Thought, wow, I am in a New York restaurant. Asked for Americanas (on menu) from both the table assistant and Server who asked about drinks and received regular coffee.  In addition the third drink request I had to point to it on menu however once delivered it was DELICIOUS! The bread was just dropped off without words or even a coffee refill interaction? Although the bread was DELICIOUS! However the table next to us was given burnt bread in my opinion. Maybe he asked for it that way?Finally we started to receive engagement!  Well at least once. As our breakfast was delivered .... back to disappointment. My eggs were not over hard which is how I asked. Over hard means no yolk - UGH! Everyone left food on their plate. Not as good as we anticipated. Once we asked for check (after multiple waves to Server) we were asked if we needed anything else to drink? #serverfail. Maybe it was just our server, other servers seemed very attentive to tables around us. Hope others get the experience they deserve!",

Considering the chaotic environment in the casino outside the restaurant, we felt at ease and enjoyed our two hour stay. All of the staff, from our host, to our busser, Ricardo, managerial staff, and especially, our server Juan Sanchez, treated us like family. They kindly accommodated our every need. The bread was delicious. And they agreed to serve their sweet and creamy vodka sauce with it, upon request. I enjoyed every item on the three course menu. The tiramisu is to die for! I highly recommend this place before Zumanity. Thank you!!",

The pancakes were a little lighter than typical, this was a welcome change.  Pancakes can be awfully dense at times, so these were nice.  The bacon was of good quality.  My hash browns were sufficiently toasted.  I'll say, the service was decent, but the food took a LONG time.  And, the restaurant was not that crowded.  I don't blame our server, maybe someone in the kitchen called in sick or something.  Our water glasses were filled regularly, our food just took a long time.  She did bring us toast early with jam and butter, so that helped.   All in all, fairly average breakfast, but a nice break from the usual Vegas coffee shop routine.",

The meal came with free bread, which the server was kind to fill up. The actual food that I ordered had an extremely small portion size which was a little disappointing for a chain-ish restaurant. The other issue is that since it wasn't super busy, it felt like employees were always staring at us and just leaned against the wall looking at our table. Little creepy but maybe that would be better at a busier time.",

Come to think of it, gambling makes our stomachs growl with hunger.    At noon, we walked up without reservations and were seated right away as we've done in the past.  My husband had been looking forward to having their lasagna made with their in-house fresh made pasta for lunch and a cold glass of Peroni beer but unfortunately they removed lasagna from their menus. But, all was not lost as we ordered their always lightly battered and crisp Calamaretti Fritti (Fried Baby Squid) and an Anduja Burrata Pizza.  We were happy with the lightness of the calamaretti fritti as its batter was airy and not greasy.  The thin-crust Anduja Burrata pizza was topped with mozzarella, Grana Padano, chiffonade of basil, tomato sauce, oregano, burrata and spicy Anduja pork sauce.    The appetizer and pizza was tasty and filling enough for us to perk up our energy to hit the casinos again.  After all, we didn't want to go into a food coma and waste our fun time while in Las Vegas.",

II Fornaio had a 3 course meal special for $39/person so I went ahead and dined in. I ordered the chicken served with spinach, cut baked potato wedges.The entre salad was mixed greens style with a strong vinaigrette dressing(Too strong for me taste).   We were seated next to the outside barrier, but this an be not so private because other patrons(in walkway of hotel)will stand there and loudly converse. I truly appreciate the manager that came over to our table just to check on us and informed him about the loud bystanders next to our table. He offered us a complimentary cocktail for the loudness we experienced. That for me was great customer service and empathy for their customers!  In my opinion, a glass wall barrier/roped off area would help the privacy and noise issues.  Verdict: Excellent and prompt service! Food was served in less than 20 minutes. Server was attentive and took great care to please. This alone will have back as a repeat customer! Well done II Fornaio :)",

Only drawback was Polenta at breakfast, the most bland flavor which Manager came over to table and apologized for after waiter told him I loved the corned beef hash but not Polenta. Took some $$ off bill which was very nice.  For dinner has chicken with shells, sun dried tomatoes and cheese in a wine sauce that was to die for.",

Happy hour has some deals on the vino but I got distracted walking in by the infusion drinks- but times always sad seeing a $14 drink on the bill that costs more than half the price of the food. If you come here I would just go vino.  They start you off with a nice selection of bread and dipping oil and balsamic vinegar which was so yummy!",

The service was ok/good, the food was good but with LV re$ort pricing.   I've been to other Il Fornaios in California, this one is great, but if you're here for several days, this is one of those \"once during your trip\" kind of place. They did not have gluten free pasta, so I got the salmon dish which was very good.   The ambiance was great for what we needed for our special event, but there is a food court lane in NYNY with things like pizza, hot dogs, Mexican, and Asian cuisine that was also nice to visit.",

I had eggs Benedict and must confess that having a husband as a chef does not help...the major challenge in an Eggs Benedict are egg and bread structure...each have to be firm and delicate at the same time. Sourdough, in my opinion is not the correct choice for the bread because it takes too much effort to cut through it-at the destruction of the assembly. The eggs were not poached firm and fell apart at first touch. Finally, not sure about the Hollandaise sauce; well I am not sure. It was actually a cheese sauce with Parmesan Cheese. Was not expecting a cheese sauce with this dish.",

The portions were fine, and the eggplant was not bad.  The pizza, though, was nothing special at all.  In fact, it was slightly tricky to eat since the \"crust\" [a term I will use loosely here] was neither foldable nor particularly firm.  The table itself was too small and the waiter was very slow and forgetful.  When the pizza came out, as the guy sliced it he knocked into a glass and spilled a bit-- a combination of tiny table and clumsiness, though I'm not factoring \"these things happen\" in to my impression.  At the end of the day, the place was a little bit more expensive than it really should be and the atmosphere was somewhat lacking, but it wasn't horrible and perhaps you might have a better experience with a larger table and some different menu choices.",

The waiter was kind enough as to let me have fresh grated parm cheese & oil with it, instead of their oil and balsamic combination (I don't like balsamic- too bitter).  The pasta was just average to me, my husband said his was average as well.  We have been to some great Italian restaurants and there is definitely an art in the sauce, their sauce here tastes more like preggo.  Still I liked my experience overall.  Waiter was friendly, restaurant atmosphere was nice and somewhat romantic, and food overall was pretty good.  Eat here if you are hungry and don't want to go somewhere nicer, otherwise move on.  I doubt I'll be back without some serious incentive because there are a ton of amazing restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "For our Vegas getaway we stayed at New York New York. Every time we passed by this place there were tons of people and the place seemed nice, so on our last morning we decided to give it a try. And here starts the reasons for just 2 stars: 1. We walked up to the podium a min after the couple ahead of us. Instead of greeting the two of us as well and the host COMPLETELY ignored us! He just acknowledged the first couple and took them to their table, not so much as a smile in our direction. I would have been willing to overlook this if the meal hadn't continued in the wrong direction. Before I go on, a kudos to the management: My bf ordered waffles and I ordered an omelette. About 5 min after our order was taken the manager headed over with a beautiful plate of waffles. He explained that their waffle machine had been broken all morning and it just started working again. The manager didn't want to take the chance that his client wouldn't get the requested order and so decided to let the order go out early. Nicely done. 2. My bf didn't want to start eating before me and we figured an egg couldn't take too long, so we kept chatting and waited. The table that was seated after us received their eggs and I was still foodless (this was 20 min after the waffles arrived). Just as I was about to say something I saw our waiter realize the mistake and turn a 180 on his heels back to the kitchen. However, he did not see that I had witnessed his mistake and was expecting him to head over to our table to give a small apology for the wait. Not so. When my omelette finally arrived I expected that to be his opportunity to give a small 'I'm sorry'. Not so. The mistake was never acknowledged, quite the contrary, our waiter ignored us through the whole meal! That should teach me not to expect.",

I had a preset menu for guests and they all told me afterward how great the food was, yadda yadda. Good times were had by all.   The servers were always nearby to fill wineglasses--they were extremely polite and professional. I even had one let me take the restaurant's wineglass with me since I was still drinking from it after all the guests had left!  haha   It was actually someone's glass--don't know who drank from it before and I didn't really care.

Not many things were opened besides the Chinese restaurant, Chin Chin, serving a breakfast buffet and Il Fornaio and a hot dog place.  We took a peak into Chin Chin and it was surprising a Chinese place was serving a typical standard American Breakfast: muffins, waffles, etc.  So we decided to chance it goin to Il Fornaio even though there's one in our town.  I got the corned beef hash with fried polenta and gorgonzola, and poached eggs.  Bf had simliar dish but it was a corned beef hash omelette.  Both were amazing.  The polenta was so rich but not as crispy as I've had it before but still great.  Corned beef was seasons beautifully and poached eggs done to perfection.  Coffee and Cafe Latte was pretty good as well.  Very satisfying and it was reasonably priced for a nice restaurant on the strip.  I think it was around 30 dollars for both our meals w/ drinks.  I would totally go again and maybe try out dinner next time...OR just go to the one in my area..LOL.",

    "text": "Stopped at Il Fornaio after a very long walk around the Vegas strip touring the various hotels and casinos. While I wasn't expecting much, thinking the hotel was a play on a theme but didn't take the whole New York concept seriously, I was pleasantly surprised.   The food was amazing! Some of the best italian food on the west coast, and my mom lives out there so that's saying a lot. I ordered canneloni, which is hard enough to find as it is, and my friend had the lasagna. I wanted both for myself. Their menu was also decently priced, especially for Vegas.   Our server was excellent. I wish I remember his name, but he was very nice and extremely helpful. He recommended a few little-known hot spots off the strip, and chatted with us despite being the only one serving the entire patio. We were also seated right away, which is a rarity on a holiday weekend in Vegas when you don't have a reservation.  While I love the food and the atmosphere of the hotel itself was great, the set up of the restaurant was odd. They have a patio, which would normally be fantastic, but it's still inside the hotel, so you're actually eating on the casino floor. I love to people watch, but it was hard to hear any conversation with all the noise from the slots and passersby. Maybe if they covered it or put in a glass wall it would be a bit more bearable, but the food is more than worth the noise.   If you're looking for great italian on a budget in Vegas, Il Fornaio is it!",

I ordered the Pennoni alla Vodka which had a delicious vodka-cream sauce and bits of bacon! yum.  The entree was $16.99, which is rather expensive for such a dish.  Though I blame it on being in Vegas where everything's marked up... and I suffered sticker shock the entire time I was there.  The bread did come with balsamic vinegar and olive oil to dip in, however the bread would had been much much better if it was remotely fresh baked or even warm.    Next time in Vegas I'll prob try a different place for Italian food.",

First, the complimentary bread was cold and featured a hardened crust that could have cut the roof of your mouth open. Then my entree barely filled me up...  I opted for the Ravioli alla Lucana ($19.79), which features: Organic spinach ravioli filled with Italian sausage, ricotta, Grana Padano and fennel; topped with fresh tomatoes, spicy tomato sauce with imported peperoncino, pecorino pepato cheese and fresh basil  I received about 5 pieces of ravioli and had no problems finishing my plate. It was tasty, but the portion was just too small. With the service charged tacked on, I paid something like almost 30 bucks for 5 pieces of pasta... not worth it.",

Service: Miguel the host was amazing.  He was SO good to us every single morning that we went to the restaurant.  It is because and thanks to him that our experience was always 5 stars.  The manager was also very good to my family and I.  Thank you Vania Carlos & Jefferson for great service as well.  Very sweet and attentive.  Food:  The food was amazing!! I ordered the Omellete Verdure every day for four days straight.   This did not bore me in any way.  Actually,  it was the complete opposite of boring. It was the best omelette I have ever had in my life. EXTREMELY FRESH INGREDIENT WARNING.  Omelette came with fresh crunchy asparagus spears, zucchini, and fresh broccoli florets.  UNBELIEVABLE.  They also put rosemary in their omelettes which I think is genius.  Ambiance: Great if you dine on the terrace!!  Waffles are delicious.  They come with banana, strawberry, and whip cream YUMM  The bread is beyond.  Obviously made by their own bakery.  SO DELICIOUS.    Thank you for the amazing food and amazing experience!",

The outside of the place looked like a really fancy 5 star restaurant. The menu outside the restaurant was electronic , almost iPad like. We saw a couple of things we liked and decided to step in.   The hostess quickly sat us and our waiter was already there to greet us. Quickly came out with appetizers and water. The bread was home made and really good. My bf ordered some pasta and I ordered a salad. The service meanwhile was really good, refills were always poured and bread was always out. The food was really good. Decent portions which left you stuffed at the end of the meal. Everything was True Italian. The decor of the place was really fancy. Marble floors, diamond looking walks, chandlers on the ceiling , so pretty and everything and everyone was really professional. You can tell the people that work her stride for great customer service.  The bill was not the cheapest but indeed worth every penny. Check this place out if you want Italian food - you will not be disappointed.",

Like most Strip locations the pricing is fairly moderate but the pre-fix menu they offer is worthy of your time and appetite.  It was midweek so we didn't require a reservation and took a seat inside as compared to the \"outside\" dining within the casino and enjoyed a subtle atmosphere. I wouldn't go as far as saying 'old fashioned' or 'authentic' but great flavor profiles and good portions with great service and pleasant atmosphere. Give it a try.",

But this one wasn't good.   We ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees. Nobody was impressed and we had 20 people. I asked the waiter what's the best pasta dish on the menu and he recommended these raviolis. What came out were these sad lifeless raviolis with no flavor. I don't even think they salted the water when cooking the pasta.   The desserts were probably the highlight of the meal but I'm not really a dessert fan soooo I have to review this purely for the food.

My dish was great, but it was carpaccio which is very hard to mess up as it is pre-made slices of cured beef and cheese.   They did offer gluten free paste dishes only, but my friend orders a special dish that he returned for being inedible and the ordered the house special lasagna which I could not try as they do not have a gluten-free option, but my friend ate it out of sheer hunger. He said 'it was salty and lacking'   The staff was not friendly, they seemed tiered of being there and they were more into chitchat and bantering with each other over being a attentive to the guests.  Needles to say we asked for the check when waiting for the server to come back to order another drink, we decided to take our business elsewhere.   My carpaccio was good and that's as mush as I'll say about that!",

We received our dinners really quickly which was great. And they did not disappoint! The penne vodka was so good...it has pieces of bacon in it....how can you go wrong! My boyfriends pasta also tasted fantastic. It had a nice garlicky flavor without being too overpowering. After finishing and sitting for a while we ordered dessert. I thought the dinner was amazing but dessert blew me away! I ordered the cannoli plate and they were to DIE FOR. They were mini cannoli so it didn't over fill me which was great.  Overall a wonderful dining experience with absolutely amazing food! If only more Italian restaurants were like this!",

I only came here one day and had a veggie omelette with a side of potatoes. It was roughly $12 and was a pretty average omelette. The other items my table ordered looked like they were good. The French toast looked solid and the pancakes looked pretty large and filling. In hindsight, I should have probably tried one of those, but I elected for the omelette. I can't speak for their lunch or dinner menu, but if you're staying at this hotel, it's a good back up option if things around aren't open. I would not go out of my way for this restaurant, however my experience there for brunch was a 4/5 experience.",

I read so many negative reviews on Yelp and was hesitant on dining here, but I'm glad I gave this place a chance.   My boyfriend and I came here for dinner around 8:30 and the restaurant was already busy.  We were greeted by the host and were taken to our booth immediately.  The waiter came by to introduce himself and handed us menus and waters.  Service from beginning to end was excellent.  Waters were refilled continuously and servers were so kind and friendly.  They have a large menu with many Italian selections - appetizers, pasta, pizza, salads, desserts, etc.  They also offer a wide selection of wine!   I ordered the Linguine Mare Chiaro.  The seafood was cooked perfectly.  The clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops tasted great!  No fishy smell or taste, which means it was fresh. I'm very pleased with the execution; the seafood was cleaned VERY thoroughly.  The pasta was al dente and nicely sauced.  My entree was delicious and the wine I had was great!  I loved this dish and would highly recommend it if you're a seafood lover.   My boyfriend had the pizza and he said it tasted great.  It also looked really good.  I have no other details, sorry.",

We ordered french toast, pancakes, cheese omelette, and ham benedicts. The french toast looked burnt on the outside but was so gooey on the inside my husband spat it out. That's where the pancakes came in since we sent back the French toast. The pancakes were very thin, difficult to cut, and sort of chewy. My server recommended the benedicts, which the ham tasted cheap, and instead of English muffin, it was the same baguette-like bread used for the French toast. So thus, I ate chewy benedicts. The cheese omelette was okay, mainly because the cheese had some flavor. Both our meals came with thin potatoes, some burnt, some undercooked.   However I really enjoyed the hot tea I ordered (vanilla bean). And our server was very friendly, helpful, and attentive. Not enough to save it from two stars. The Italian fare, I'm sure, is better, but will not be returning to find out.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch on our last day in Vegas. The server did not spend much time at the table and the restaurant was not busy, only a few tables.After we declined drinks (apparently its offensive to be sober in Vegas), his mood was rather sour. We ordered two lunch specials, a panini and a salmon dish. There was a bread basket with oil which was ok. No attention to refilling our waters. Instead of the panini, there was a steak presented, one that did not look too tasty. The food presentation in general was lacking. The salmon was very dry with very little flavor. It was tepid when served. The entire plate was drowned in oil. It did not taste like olive oil either, for the bread or the entrees, probably soybean oil cut with olive. It took very long for the panini to come out, we had already finished the salmon. There was no apology or offer extended to compensate for the service mistake. Even if it was no one's fault, server presence is the difference between a happy and annoyed customer. The panini was very dry and the beef tough. The server seemed impatient for us to leave, maybe he was having a stressful day. The menu was a lot more appealing than the actual restaurant and experience.",

Anyway, the food at Il Fornaio was pretty bland. The best part was probably the the bread and olive oil at the beginning of the meal. We ordered bruschetta as an appetizer. It only contained three pieces even though we had four people at our table. I have never been served bruschetta with less than four pieces. For my entree I had the pasta with vodka sauce and the sauce tasted like it was straight from a jar. The bacon that was in this dish was rubbery and gross. I tried my dad's pizza and it was mediocre at best. The portions were also very small for an Italian restaurant which are notorious for over serving. Would probably not go back.",

Granted, I am not into the real fancy schmancy kind of Italian that seemed to be the forte on the menu, and I really could not even find many traditional and regular Italian dishes I recognized on the menu.  Perhaps it was just a bit upscale for me, I prefer the good old standard Italian dishes, and this is definitely not the place to get it.  Also, very overpriced for what you got.  The only thing I really found on the menu that appealed to me was the pizza ( go figure )  and even that was incredibly blah, no spice or flavor whatsoever.",

No real bad experiences, but every time I'm there the wait staff looks different, so the real bad reviews you see here may be partially attributable to high turnover.  The food quality has always been good, but there is a wide variation in \"heaviness\" of the dishes.  The food is \"northern Italian\" which tends to be a bit richer than typical southern Italian dishes.  There is lots of dishes which feature heavier, creme-type sauces.  I personally don't prefer this, so I order lighter items such as the vegetarian pizza, spagetti with cuttlefish sauce (that's not it's exact name, but I can't remember it right now).  There is a couple simple salads which are excellent.  The desserts are also very good.  I've also had the mannicotti, which was okay, but had a heavy sauce which made it richer than I'd like.  I would recommend reading the descriptions carefully and asking your server for recommendations if not sure.  The prices are pretty reasonable, so I'd dine here again.  It's much better than Regale next door at the Excaliber.",

Our waiter was awesome. I wanted to get down and dirty with the alcohol already but the server recommended something more tame. I had red wine and Cannelloni Con Pollo. The dinner was great! Felt like little Italy (although I haven't been there, I will soon!). We also had tiramisu for dessert. Thank you Il Fornaio for prepping my stomach for a liver-killing night! Awesome experience!",

The absolute WORST restaurant in Las Vegas.   1) Very long wait, and attitude.  2) Ordered cioppino, dish half filled with broth and probably about 3 tiny pieces of seafood, I think it was over $30 for this. When I asked is this cioppino, and Ive never seen it like this , was told all restarants prepare it differently.  2b) I sent it back (and I never do this to dishes) and ordered a pizza instead, and even the pizza was very weak. Trust me, if you went to the real New York, you'd be hard pressed to find worst pizza. Go to Rays, the pizza is $2 a slice, and WAYYYYYYYY better. There are much better than Rays too!   3) Menu selection horrid.   4) Sometimes, you pay for atmosphere, The atmosphere here was nothing special, I have no clue how they remain open.  Go to Noras instead , about a zillion times better, authentic Italian.   For the $ they charge, there is no excuse for this place. I'll never go to this place again.",

I guess the only good thing is that if you sit \"outside\" the restaurant you can overlook the casino floor while you eat.

For some reason they really wanted to sit on the \"patio\" which is really just the area outside of the main restaurant right next to the slot machines.  As you can imagine that made for a really loud meal and the main thing that kept me from rating Il Fornaio any higher.  We were here on a Sunday night, and had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated.  Like any Italian place, you get plenty of bread with vinegar and oil to tide you over while you decide on what to have.  I went for the margherita pizza, which was more than I could handle.  If I recall correctly it was in the 10-15 dollar range.  Most of the other entrees are a bit more pricey.  The wait staff was friendly but a little too attentive for my taste.  I don't need to be asked every 4 minutes if I'm ok, or have someone reach through my conversation to refill my water that's not even half gone.  If I go back here, I'll definitely get inside seating.  The food is slightly above the Olive Garden.  I wouldn't absolutely rule this place out for a second visit, but it's far from your best option.",

Right!?  Well, I saw this place almost immediately, but wanted to keep looking around to cherish all the options. When I rounded back to this place, there was a long line and a full house! Must be good! So wifey and I jumped in the \"hurry up and wait\" line. Was it worth the wait? UmMMmM...??? Maybe.  After about 20 mins of tummy rumblings, we were finally seated. First off, the house bread wasn't impressive at all. I ordered the Pennoni Alla Vodka w/ a Crown and Ginger Ale to wash it down. They returned w/ a small almost shot cup sized mixed drink cup ($9.99!?) and a plate of pasta that looks like I could whip it up as a teen home alone on a hungry night. Seriously, if the cups were dogs, my mixed drink cup would have been a miniature pinscher. The pasta actually turned out to be pretty good because the apple smoked bacon and the vodka sauce saved it. Wifey went health nut on me for a change and ordered a \"Insalata cesarina\"...sounds fancy huh!? Yeah...they could have just put Caesar salad on the dang menu, but I guess they had to spruce it up for the genuine Italian feel. Well, it was a big disappointment...so I ended up sharing my plate w/ her.   As I mentioned earlier, that this place tries to live up to the Italian feel...well I did here a couple speaking to the waiter and tell him that the food tasted exactly like what is served in Italy! I knew he was legit Italian because the waiter had to have a translator decipher his Italian. I would give this place 2-stars, but being that it satisfied a \"real\" Italian couple and that many of the other things looked good (as I scanned others' plates while waiting for my food)...I upgraded it to 3-stars. The pizza seemed good because many people ordered it.",

They stay open 1 hr past almost all the other restaurants, so you have until midnight to get some food.  Bread is bomb diggity!!!!",

I had the lamb shank, and when it came out, I almost went into shock at the sheer size of the meat. So I took my fork and knife and attacked it the best I could, and I made a pretty good dent in it, but no where near finishing. And let me just say, I can sometimes eat like a bottomless pit. They give you some yummy bread, and I love their olive oil. I don't normally notice the taste of olive oils, but I like the taste of it at this restaurant. We also had the bruschetta as an appetizer, which was just delicious. But you only get three pieces, so get ready to fight over that third one. (I'm kidding, it's enough to share between two) Bf had the pasta with Italian sausage, which was just delicious.   I can't wait to go back...",

    "text": "Absolutely mediocre.  Normally, a restaurant like this wouldn't deserve such a poor rating as this is what I would expect from a cheap fast food restaurant for around 5 dollars. For around 20 a plate in a casino worth probably over 100 million, this level of quality is abhorrent.   The pasta seemed like a box of barilla I could have cooked from walmart, coated in a novice chefs sauce that was like watered down wine mixed with Kraft italian dressing. The lasagna was better, but only because the cheap meat and cheese covered the ragu sauce (as described on menu actually as RAGU). The salad was soggy and dressing poor. The highlight of the meal was the packaged balsamic vinegar served with the bread. Very poor food, made worse by the exorbitant prices.  The service was also extremely poor, we were only visited by the busboy who kept refilling our glasses. The waiter was mostly absent.  Atmosphere was nice, if a little cheesy, but a live concert which seemed to be going on in the casino was a bit distracting during a meal.  Could have got an equivalent meal at sbarros for significantly cheaper.  Don't make the mistake. This is a tourist trap and the only reason it survives is because of its location.",

    "text": "We drove from Phoenix for a midweek getaway with some friends in Las Vegas. We got in a little late and after a much-needed nap we decided around 11PM we were starving. After walking the strip we found the only seemingly-tasty eatery open at the New York-New York. Oh boy.  They were very open, so it wasn't like we came in like inconsiderate morons right before closing. Our section was very understaffed; one elderly man taking orders, filling waters, and serving food to literally everyone dining at that hour. He was still really friendly and it got our hopes up.  Iced tea was alright. Refills started lagging and I really understood however was bummed, because the food was all very, very... very salty. The bread was good, I always feel weird dipping bread into plain oil though, like one of those things Americans think is really upscale and authentic but it's really just something cranked out of the obese arteries that also crank out nasty 'Italian' chain restaurants like Macaroni Grill..  We each started with a house salad. $10 at Il Fornaio gets you a pile of floppy browning lettuce doused in Kraft Italian dressing. Literally. Unimpressive.   Husband ordered the penne with vodka sauce and I ordered the lobster ravioli with cream sauce. Ha.. ha.. ha.. After a 45-minute wait after the salads were cleared, we were served the worst excuses for pasta. My 11-year old sister could make better pasta. I guess to Il Fornaio, 'cream sauce' means 'brown gravy flavored with fish'. I guess 'vodka sauce' is Easy Mac sauce with a sour aftertaste. My lobster was horrid. I'm not sure what it reminded me of, but it was so tough, like overcooked shrimp. It looked like overcooked shrimp too. Our entrees were so unappetizing we just gave up. Let me add that my husband has been in military training for the past year and is completely used to less-than-gourmet, and even he couldn't eat this stuff.  Disclaimer: I am not against paying top dollar for food that deserves it [the next night we had a grade-A experience at Shibuya which ran us almost double]. This food deserved maybe ten bucks, total, because it reminded me of Bertolli frozen pasta dinners. But we got stiffed for $80 [before tip] for this hot mess. I think it's pretty obvious when food is unsatisfactory, but rather than asking if something was wrong with our food [as the other restaurants demanding this amount of money do], joked he wasn't taking our plates until we ate at least half of each our dishes.  I'm going to make this easy for everyone: Il Fornaio is good if all you're used to is Olive Garden.",

(I might have been a little famished from alot of hiking and not alot of eating though...) My gf had the chicken which had a few bones in it, which was a bit odd, but other than that, all good. Yummy bread with olive oil served, but we had to ask for balsamic, which was a little odd. There's a little \"patio\" area that's right next to the slot machines, and seems likea TERRIBLE place to sit...  We sat inside and it was quite nice.  Waitstaff was VERY nice, almost overly so, but all in all good meal for a fair price in vegas.",

I remembered seeing this place while in NY, NY, so we crossed the street and sat down to soak up some alcohol.  Given my state at the time, I don't remember a lot of the specifics.  I know I liked the food - it really hit the spot.  I know everyone was super nice and we sat right down late on a Sunday.  I have a feeling it was obvious something was up with the two of us, and they maybe went the extra mile a bit.  I guess what I am trying to get at is that if you're ever in Vegas and need a little comfort pasta (and if you spend enough time in Sin City, you eventually will) this just might be what you are looking for. It certainly was for me.",

They just used to have really good sausage and bacon and after a while the quality seemed to decline and the food became a little bland.  I would go back to try out lunch or dinner.  I have had dinner once at an Il Fornaio in Seattle and it was pretty good.  I think it fills the same niche as Lombardi's in the Miracle Mile shops - middle of the road Italian food.  It's probably a solid option in New York New York since (I think) the food options there are a bit slim.  Although, MGM and all of it's eatery options are just a skywalk away.",

I go to cut the first ravioli and put the slice on my fork when under that slice is a black hair. My husband said hell no I'm not paying for hair. So we sent it back. Then I sat and sat and sat and my husband stopped eating. The guy comes over and goes how is everything. I look at him and say I don't know you tell me. At least 30 minutes went by. He suddenly had this look of shock like \"Oh, crap I totally forgot her order.\" I said I'm not paying for any of this meal and we walked out. I hate them. I wont even eat at the one near me because I'm so pissed from this experience.",

Two teenagers each had a pasta dish with sauces that were quite good.  Both were fine, and portions were on the small side.  The bread was excellent.  As a bakery, their abilities are quite good.  Olive oil was fresh as well.  The salmon was a bit over cooked.  It was not what I would consider uber fresh, just okay.  I would expect it to be a bit more fresh.  The toddler's pizza was 20 bucks.  I guess since we removed the cheese it became a \"specialty pizza\".  The service was suited to a 15% tip but not more.  The price was over 100 bucks with no alcohol, no drinks.  I would think a better value can be found elsewhere.  Nothing bad here, but would I go back for just a so so meal when others excel? Nope.  Overall, ... meh...",

Located in New York-New York, this trattoria boasts an exhibition kitchen with a wood-burning oven that produces roast chicken and duck and a variety of pizzas. Also on the menu are homemade pastas, mesquite-grilled fish, steak, and chops, fresh seasonal salads and soups, and an array of desserts and Italian coffees. It's a nice change from the buffets, and decidely better than the San Francisco location, which has been in a decline the past few years.",

Waiter warned that the bread basket would be addictive - but he was wrong. The olive bread tasted too much like olive - I guess I don't like olives. The sesame roll was kinda dry. Sourdough was OK - interior wasn't as soft and chewy as I was hoping.   I ordered the promising sounding special - pesto penne pasta with sun-dried tomatoes and roasted pistachios. It was OK, but not amazingly so. For $16, I was hoping for something with more pesto flavor.   SO had Cannelloni Con Pollo - Large pasta tubes filled with roasted chicken, swiss chard, ricotta, pecorino and parmesan cheese, onions and applewood-smoked bacon; baked in the wood-fired oven with bechamel and topped with sauteed champignon mushrooms and marinara sauce. Sounds fancy, doesn't it? Well, it's just thin sheets of pasta with stuff wrapped up in it. Like an egg roll, but steamed rather than fried. Maybe it was me, but I couldn't really taste all the swiss chard, pecorino, etc. I wouldn't order it again.",

We got there and they promptly escorted us into a private room, where  we all wined and dined on what we all thought was very good food. And the best part was, we fed 16 people wine/drinks, entrees and desserts for under 800 bucks. Can't beat that!

What did arrive (30 minutes after we ordered) was not fully cooked or cold OR not even what we ordered!   Pasta vodka was certainly not Al dente (rather it was hard and not fully cooked).  Spaghetti & meatballs were barely lukewarm.  Meatballs didn't seem freshly made, but premade from the freezer.  Pizza Christina wasn't even the right one!  Some other pizza showed up. Nothing tasted good (like it always had in the past).  We requested the manager and after 15 minutes he showed up very apologetic that the computer system was down.  He did offer to correct the dishes that had issues and adjusted our bill for which we were grateful.  Sadly we won't return ....",

We had no clue where we would end up but knew there would plenty of choices. This was the first place we saw and we decided to go with it.   The bread was delicious and I could tell the olive oil was a decent quality. Not the best I've ever had, but for the price point certainly not the worst. We did have to ask for cheese, but they brought it over right away. As with every single restaurant in Vegas they are slow with water service. I guess they want people to pass out?  The pollo al peperoncino sounded so amazing all 3 of us ordered it. It was chicken marinated with rosemary, sage, thyme, crushed red pepper, white wine, Dijon mustard and lemon. It was really good! The chicken was so tender and cooked perfectly.   I'm sure the pasta was better (just a preference) but I knew I needed protein and to lay off the carbs! The sauteed spinach and potatoes served with the dish were a bit of a let down.   I felt for the prices this was one of the better meals I had in Vegas this go around. The entrees were in the $18-26 range. I've had sub sandwiches in food courts in Vegas cost more than that.  The staff was friendly and seemed to accommodate us pretty quickly. I just wish they would step up the game with water in all of these hotels! I know it's the desert, but you have dehydrated drunks running around!",

    "text": "just went to Vegas with the family and having been going to this place every year for the last five years. The food is still good but the service and the treatment was horrible to say the least. We went in for happy hour this past Wednesday, between the hours of 4-6 pm, We usually go with a smaller group but this time there was six of us. If you want to order off of the discounted happy hour menu you must sit in a small area by the bar which has a total of three small bar tables or you can sit by the bar. only options that they give you even though the restaurant area was 3/4 empty, we asked if we could sit in the dining area, they stated if you did you would have to pay regular price, so they would rather squish 6 of us on a table meant for two rather than accommodating 4 adults and two children, meanwhile the restaurant was empty. Then we ordered the food and our waitress stated that we ordered a lot of food, 2 orders of calamari a pasta dish and 5 pizzas, she said it probably would not fit on the table, that is when we stated that would rather sit in a more comfortable setting but insisted in order to get the happy hour pricing we must sit in that area. Then we asked for bread and butter and she said that our meals do not come with it, and that if we wanted it we would have to pay $3.50 for it, its only free in the dining area, which we stated we would pay and we did order a dinning area entree at regular pricing, the pasta dish so it should of been complimentary but regardless we were willing to pay. Lastly, we asked for the bill and a different server came to remove dishes and give us our bill, 1 and 1/2 pizza were left over by the kids out of 5 pizzas we ordered, so like any other restaurant we have attended, we asked for a take out box, when the server brought back the boxes he stated that there pizzas off the happy hour menu are for eat in only no take out is usually given due to the discounted pricing he stated he would do it this time only, which is ludicrous to say the least as we paid for our food regardless of pricing, he stated that the pizza we ordered was usually $22 instead of the $7 we paid for it and was condescending to say the least, that is what broke my intention to go back yet, just lost a long distance customer that was loyal to your restaurant for the last 5 years, with all the options in Vegas you would think the service would be outstanding, rather a shame of a place that made us feel lowly. I would recommend trying Giada at the Cromwell, highly rated and would have went but booked up, i will try a new Italian place next time. Lastly, why even have a happy hour when you do not make your guests happy",

    "text": "Breakfast review.   Our bellhop handed up a bogo entree coupon for breakfast the day we checked in at NYNY, so we had to try!  Coffee and OJ was standard. Breakfast came with a basket of bread and butter. I also ordered a side of fruit not realizing how huge the entree would be... Oops. I was able to take it with me though  I got the corned beef hash with over easy eggs. It came with grilled polenta with Gorgonzola cheese- totally not my thing. It wasn't bad though, just a texture I don't usually enjoy.   The corned beef was SO flavorful. I believe it had a mixture of onions and potatoes with this. I was very pleased with my choice.   My husband got the pancakes with real maple syrup. The pancakes were done right, high quality maple syrup. We had no complaints!  Our service was good and quick, the view was lovely from the \"outside\" (really inside, just a casino view)... It was early so no one was blowing cigar smoke in our direction.   Highly recommend, especially if you have the BOGO coupon and are staying at NYNY.",

My family and I came here for a quick breakfast 2 days in a row.  The prices weren't that cheap, as is with many in-hotel establishments, but the food was pretty good.  I tried the ham/egg/cheese croissant ($6.29), the bacon/egg/cheese croissant ($6.59), and the blueberry scone.  The breakfast croissants were already made and in the display case - they just microwave it when you order it (therefore, it got kind of hard as it cooled down).  The blueberry scone was crumbly on the outside and soft on the inside...yum.  A small coffee was $3.59 and lemonade $2.99.  They also sell baked breads and pastries, sandwiches, salads, cookies, and cakes, if I remember correctly.  A convenient place to get a quick bite when on the go or don't want to pay for sit-down restaurants.",

    "text": "(written January 2012)   Before I go on, I have to say that I've been to the Il Fornio in Irvine, CA multiple times and  that place deserves 5 out of 5 stars.   After feeling nostalgic for our old hunting grounds in Orange County, we decided to visit the Il Fornio in New York New York.  Here's my review:  1. Environment: Entertaining.   We were seated in their indoor \"balcony.\" The balcony area was quaint and I love the lamp posts surrounding the area.  But most of all, the balcony gave as an amazing for people watching.  Because the balcony is located inside the casino, the people watching was varied and very entertaining.    2. Service: Sufficient.  Our waiter as very friendly.  But because CES was in town this weekend, the restaurant was pretty busy and we hardly saw our waiter.  Thank goodness for the waters, or we would have been out of drinks during the middle of our dinner.    Our order was correct and the waiter was friendly.    3. Food: Meh.  I had the Cannelloni al Forno.  Weirdly, parts of the dish were hot and parts of the dish were cold.  Too bad too.  The dish would have been promising if it didn't have that weird hot/cold thing going on.  I'm not going to completely write off this place because I know how good this restaurant can be.  However, this location is not very high on my Restaurant list.",

Service was fine even though it was busy, and they brought out my food quickly.  It was piping hot but not overly dried.  The croissant was buttery, flaky, light, and chewy... YUM.  Good amount of filling that kept me going all day until dinner.  I did like how they had a water dispenser with cups off to the side... I'm used to that in Colorado at these kinds of places.  Overall reasonable price ($6.85 for what I got).  They didn't put any napkins or any utensils in my to-go baggie, but I scored some elsewhere.  Didn't try the hot drinks (tea/coffee) as I just wanted to get in and get out.  Recommended if you're at NY NY and are looking for an on-the-go breakfast or coffee!",

I ordered it without the dressing. I instead asked for olive oil to drizzle on top. The olive oil was fruity with lemony notes. It was simple but very delicious. Also, the wine list was excellent. Reasonably priced, and a nice selection. We were both very satisfied.",

I actually ate at Il Fornaio in Downtown San Jose already so it was a chance for me to compare and know that the food no matter what would be good!  Service may i say was EXCELLENT! a bit TOO EXCELLENT maybe.. is that possible? from the beginning to our meal to the end of our to go boxes, the service was impeccable.. I don't think i ever seen someone tie my to go box plastic bag that neatly and tidey before!!  Our waiter was very friendly and he made our experience here fantastically genuine!  We sat in the outdoor section near the corner for less of a noise.  It was very intimate and awesome to see the people around the hotel interact... *people watch*  ( don't tell me you guys don't do that!) Plenty of bread was provided with dipping sauce ( or butter if you ask)   We ordered:  1.  Conchiglie al Pollo $18 which consisted of shell pasta, chicken breast, broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, trebbiano wine, pecorino cheese   2. Turtei con Aragosta $24 which consisted of Fresh ravioli filled with fresh Maine lobster topped with shrimp, diced tomato and lobster-cream sauce   I actually prefered the shell pasta dish.. it was very tasty.. I think i found out that raviolis aren't my pasta of choice..i will stick to my penne next time :)",

We joked and laughed and talked like we were old friends.  And he and the other staff were great at what they do.  Keep up the good work, Raul! We made reservations because it was a busy week, just before New Years.  We went with a special they advertised, a three-course meal for 29 bucks. I went with the salmon, a bowl of minestrone and the Tiramisu.  The salmon was excellent, cooked just right.  The minestrone was also very good and the dessert was great.  My only complaint would be that they brought out my main course before I even had a chance to finish my soup, which is not the best idea as I didn't want my fish room temp.  But overall, great meal.  Atmosphere, service, location were all very nice.",

He made this experience Top Class.  I truly enjoyed eating here because the service was exceptionally good.  It's staff like Erick that make it magical:)",

Ceasar salad was served with BROWN lettuce! Canalonie was stuffed with something that was supposed to be Chicken, think it was canned! Friends ravilloi resembled something like ravioli covered with canned tomatoes. The bill for 4 was over $85.00 and was not worth $$$$$ go somewhere else for a better italian meal this IS NOT ITALIAN FOOD,",

The morning after we came in we went to Il Fornaio for breakfast.  I ordered eggs, bacon and potatoes, while my man got an omelet, I believe.  My scrambled eggs were flavorless and over cooked... and some of my pieces of bacon were burnt.  The potatoes were less than exciting as well.  Not much flavor to them either.   I took it that my man left more than half of his breakfast over that he too didn't enjoy it.  Over-priced \"bleh\" food.  I give it 2 stars, because it's not THE WORST place I've ever eaten.  And the bread was decent.  We also ordered bloody marys... and those too were... BLAND and had little to no alcohol in them.  Also, we received REALLY slow service and waited probably at least 20 minutes after we had our plates removed to get our check.    I was glad we didn't pay for this and that we used our credit on a breakfast instead of a more expensive dinner there.  Oh well, I'll know better next time.",

    "text": "So while on vacation me and my wife went to Il Fornaio in the New York New York Casino in Las Vegas.  While sliding into the booth, something stabbed my finger.  I thought it was a nail or something from the cushioning.  The hostess was there and saw me pull my hand back and look at it - my finger had been punctured and was bleeding.  Investigation revealed that someone had put several toothpicks inside the cushioning pointing up and down.  If someone had sat on it they would have been injured. I suggested to the hostess that they close that table until they could check and clear the cushion.  I then asked for an antiseptic wipe to clean my finger.  A Manager showed up with an antiseptic wipe and a band aid.  He didn't ask, but I told him what had happened. He didn't offer an apology, but he was quick to say kids had sat at that table earlier and must have done that. While he was there, the hostess found another toothpick and the manager removed it.  He then left and we did not see him for the rest of the evening.  At the end of our meal we received the full check.  When we got home I emailed their corporate office explaining what had happened - no response.  The hostess was caring and great, food was pretty good.  Service besides the incident was decent.",

Also, they had a very nice Carpaccio appetizer.   That was well done.   That was it... no more good.  On the bad side,  all of the dinners were rather bland and tasteless.   My wife's lamb chops were nothing to write home about.   Several of us had pasta.   My chicken, bacon and cheese pasta had cheese and maybe a speck or two of bacon.   The chicken must have out run the chef that day.   It was nowhere to be seen.   The server forgot my friend's order, although she did write them all down.  So he had to wait while they rushed his order through which left him to snack on bread as he waited.  Oh wait, the bread was emptied in the first 5 minutes we were there, and no refills on bread or water.   (Wow, I felt like I was in jail!)  When his meal finally came, it was more than Al Dente... it was almost stiff!   The next time we saw any server, it was to present us with the bill.   Oh well.     Was IL Fornaio bad?  Not really.   Was it disappointing?   You bet it was.   Was it worth the money?   No way.    Will I be back?   Nope, I will try many new places before I come back here.",

We asked for warm fresh bread and the waiter says \"that's how it is here. we only bake it twice a day\"- this response made me laugh in ridiculousness. Ordered Parmigiana and Pasta Mare which were just ok. Not enough seasoning and both were very bland. I am a huge fan of Il Fornaio in SD, but man this place really needs to step it up.",

We came here just as we were leaving to come home from our trip to Las Vegas and as someone who is known to be rather picky when it comes to Italian food, honestly this might not have ever even got onto my list - but I'm glad it did.  We were actually in a bit of a hurry, and I did a Yelp search for close places in our hotel, and this came up.  As is often the case, once you filter out the outliers in the reviews, you actually come up with some helpful ones and it seems there are some who can appreciate what is actually pretty decent/authentic Italian food considering the venue.  Service was very friendly and fast on our visit, and while I agree this place lacks a little in atmosphere maybe, it is in a theme hotel so using that as a primary judgment seems short sighted.  Food was good too, we had....  Uova Con Pancetta Affumicata Omelette Alla Contadina  Both were good, particularly the apple-wood smoked bacon in both dishes, and the filone toast that came with them was great too.  Good coffee as well which was well needed before our travels home for the day.  Perspective people!  This is Las Vegas, it is not Italy (and no the Venetian does not count either - but it's a good hotel).  Good thing too, because those whining about slow service would probably find it even slower and annoying if they really did go to Italy, not all folks are in a super hurry all the time, I'm actually glad for times when I'm not as well!",

You know the food is in no way fresh when you are in and out of a restaurant in 30 minutes, like we were. We were staying in New York New York and hungry for Italian food, so decided to give it a try (despite some poor yelp reviews - should have listened)! Our waiter was very nice. However when we sat down, we were given a basket of completely stale bread. Couldn't even bite into some pieces. We ordered a $13 meatball appetizer. I could not believe when it came out! Three of the smallest \"meatballs\" I had ever seen, covered in what looked like cheddar cheese - really? The meatballs themselves were tough, chewy and just horrible. The sauce they were in was so oily. I almost got up and left after that. But then a few minutes later our meals came out. Pasta was chewy and unevenly cooked. The sauce it was in was awful. If you are looking for real Italian food do not go here. Of course, I'm used to the New Haven, CT italian, but am generally not picky when it comes to food and rarely leave poor reviews. This was just awful though. Still looking for real Italian in Vegas.",

    "text": "Il Fornaio was conveniently located in the downstairs of my room in NYNY and, after walking by it several times, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there on December 23rd.    First, our waitress was extremely nice and attentive.  Our water glasses were constantly filled, our request for more oil and vinegar came immediately, empty plates were cleared off the table quickly.  I really appreciated our waitress' attentiveness and outstanding service.  Second, the inside dining area was beautiful and quiet.  It had an outstanding atmosphere for conversation.  The place was incredibly clean, spacious and chique.   I  thought the restaurant was a bit too dark but I guess it created a more intimate ambiance.   Third, the food was outstanding and, with the special 3-course meal for $33, we thought it was very reasonably priced.  The bread served to us at the beginning was crisp outside and soft delicious inside.    What did I order? I cannot remember (let alone pronounce) the fancy Italian words so bear with me as I describe the items I ordered. The appetizer was a flatbread which was almost the size of an A4 paper covered with toppings and lots lots lots of delicious cheese.  The main consisted of spinach, grilled chicken and potatoes. The spicy sauce was really the superstar of that plate.  It was too bad that I ran out of sauce halfway though my chicken. Next time, more sauce please!  And, finally, for my dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - a large square-shaped decadent light fluffy cake with layers of rich creamy coffee filling.    If there's anything to improve, I'd say the portions have to be smaller.  Strange how my feedback contradicts the complaint from a previous reviewer saying the portions were too small?  I found the appetizer was far too large and (combined with the bread at the beginning) I've eaten too many carbs that, by the time I reached my main, I was already full and couldn't enjoy it as much.  By the time dessert came, I was full beyond comfort and had to pack it up.    Overall - I enjoyed the dining experience at Il Fornaio and would recommend it to everyone (who isn't on the Atkins diet!!!!)",

    "text": "Went to LV for a long w/e with the girls, and our last night there we were looking for a great meal.  You can book a res through the Open Table app, which is convenient.  We were 5 minutes late for our res, (we walked from our hotel across the strip) but, were seated almost immediately.  Our waiter was very knowledgable of their dishes, which, is helpful if someone in your party has a food allergy.  One of the girls in our party is Gluten free, so, we had to research places that offered GF options.  Il Fornaio makes all their pasta fresh and they have a GF pasta.  My friend said it was one the best dishes she ever had.  They have about 4-5 GF options on their menu, sadly, not for desert. They start you off with a healthy bread basket (not GF) with olive oil and balsamic to dip it in.  Our meals came out fairly quickly and are decent portions.  I got the gnocchi, which, I typically do no order.  However, with that said, if I lived near this restaurant, I would go once a week for their gnocchi, it was delicious.  I did not have any drinks but I did get the limoncello cake for desert and, although I couldn't finish it after my meal, it was fantastic.    If I had to criticize, it would be to offer a Gluten Free bread for dipping.  It's not fair for an entire table to be eating the delicious, warm bread and they have to sit there and watch us enjoy.  you have the GF pasta, make the bread! =)",

    "text": "I was going to see Zumantiy again Monday night and I decided to give Il Fornaio a try.  I'm glad I did.  I was seated for my 5 PM reservation immediately.  The place was almost empty so I should have been.  I was asked my choice of eating on the casino facing patio or inside.  I chose inside.  My server, Carol, soon came to the table with bread and EVOO and balsamic vinegar.  She poured some EVOO onto a dish and then asked if I wanted any balsamic.  Thank you!  I don't like it when the two are mixed together on a bread plate. The bread basket had some focaccia and two rolls.    She took my iced tea order and within a minute, the bus person working with her was at my table with the drink and some sweetener.    I had looked at the menu online but she pointed out the daily specials menu.  After looking that over, I changed my mind as to the main course.  For a starter, I ordered the grilled polenta with mushrooms and sheep's milk cheese.  The dish was very good.  The polenta with the mushrooms and the cheese made a great combination.  The main course is where I changed my mind.  I ordered off the specials menu the shell pasta in a gorgonzola cream sauce with sliced prosciutto. green peas, and topped with toasted walnuts.  The gorgonzola sauce was excellent and the addition of the crispy prosciutto and toasted walnuts gave it a great flavor and wonderful texture.  I'm glad they had the specials menu.  The pasta was brought to the table very hot.    For dessert, I got the crema al doppio gusto.  The menu describes it as fennel-infused custard with chocolate mousse and caramelized sugar topping.  The dessert had the fennel custard on the bottom and was topped with the chocolate mousse and then a thin layer of sugar that had been caramelized with a torch.  During the meal, Carol was attentive.  She checked in several times during my time there to make sure everything was OK.  The bus person removed dishes promptly and refilled my iced tea 3 times always without having to ask.  Outstanding.  I am a fan!",

It's located inside of New York New York casino and there's an 'inside' portion (which is inside of the restaurant) and there's the 'outer' section which is actually gated off on the casino floor where you can sit and people watch.  Both are inside of the building.  The food is great.  I don't eat meat and my husband certainly does.  Both of us have tried multiple dishes and have returned on subsequent Las Vegas Trips.  I believe we've eaten here 5 times?    I'll continue to eat here because the food is great, the waiters are very nice and the ambiance is fun.  Unlike other Italian places in Las Vegas, you can dress casually and comfortably and fit right in.    Note: I typically choose 'regular' menu items and not specials for two reasons: 1) Specials are usually meat-based. 2) They're usually experimental which is why they're not on the main menu.  Two trips ago I did try the special: some angel-hair pasta with eggplant.  I was pleased there was a vegetarian option and I'm in Vegas to gamble anyway so... why not?  It was truly delicious.    (They DO offer breakfast but it really is breakfast food.  In Vegas, I'm down with eating pasta at 8am but their breakfast menu really is breakfast.  :) )",

The calamari was fat and fried perfectly and was so enjoyable. The salad was good as well. They put lots of black pepper on it and I love black pepper so I was happy. However it could be overwhelming for others. I also enjoyed the freshness of the shrimp and muscles and the pasta was al dente. Price is kind of expensive but it's Vega's and in the hotel so what does one expect. I'd say if you were looking for a good meal without the walk or leaving your hotel room this is a winner.",

The eggs had a strange grey color to them in spots, which should probably warrant one-star, but the cheese and bacon were plentiful enough that I think three stars is appropriate. The croissant was delicious -- flaky, soft, and super buttery. Some sort of sauce would probably have me bumping the score up by a star, but even as it was, Il Fornaio's croissant filled my belly up pretty well as my last meal from New York New York.",

    "text": "THEY ARE LIARS!!!  I give this restaurant only one star due to its management and disrespect from the waiter that served us.  This place is located inside the New York New York Hotel.  We went to dinner at this place with a group of around 12 people or so.  We asked to split the bill four different ways.  At first the waiter said it was not a problem, then when the bill came he said his manager did not let him split the bill.  Really, since when does a restaurant NOT let you split the bill.  This was an awkward situation being that this was the first time we were meeting my sons girlfriends family, so you can imagine.    It took us an hour just to figure out the bill.  There was extra charges on there of about $100 for 4 bottles of water that no one ordered.  They automatically poured the water when we arrived to the restaurant without asking us.    This is just unacceptable!!  So the very next day we went to check out and complained to the manager (Marcello), who seemed very concerned at the time.  He told us he will look into it and apologized for everything.  We got a call from him (Marcello) 2 days later and said there is nothing he could do for us.  He said the waiter told him we asked for 14 different bills.    REALLY!!!!  There wasn't even 14 of us there!  there was only 4 different families of which 5 were children.  Our family overpaid about $100 extra due to this mistake.  DO NOT COME HERE!  TOTALLY DISRESPECTFUL AND THEY DO NOT CARE WHAT THE CUSTOMERS HAVE TO SAY!  THE WAITER LIED!",

They come in bite size portions on the plate which are perfect for sharing.  The had a great wine selection and their version of a Moscow mule was pretty good.  We had a large party which they serviced perfectly.  High recommend!",

It was delicious!  - The prosciutto pizza was dry and cold when it came out  - My friends had the minestrone soup which they didn't eat as it was cold.   It's decently priced, if you go for the $35 3 course menu. Definitely not the best dinner in town",

Our server was very slow & didn't seem to care to be there. The food was average at best. The alcohol was over priced for what you get. I ordered an Old Fashioned....there was more ice in the tiny cup than alcohol! If I were to take out the ice and orange peel, I literally had a Teaspoon of alcohol in the cup......very disappointing! I order Old Fashioned drinks all the time & this was by far the worst in terms for portion. The food overall was average....not anything I would recommend or come running back to. Aside from the waiter not showing much interest for his job, the worst part  was NO manager ever came around to see how our meal or our experience was. My wife & I go out to eat pretty often & at most places the manager comes by the table to see how the food was, and how your experience has been. At Il Fornaio it seemed they just wanted your money, that was about it. At the end it took FOREVER to get our final bill. Not very happy with our decision to eat here.....I do not recommend.",

II Fornaio (inside NYNY) is just perfect for the occasion and not to mention we got a $200 comp to splurge on food and drinks.  Everything exceeded my expectation and prices are not overly pricey but not cheap either.  The whole sea bass was so fresh and cooked to perfection.  It came with two sides.  Then the veal is tender and tasty and it also came with two sides.  Regular red wine, cognac (on the small portion), and pot wine rounded out our dinner before the Katy Perry concert in the T-mobile Arena literally next to the parking garage.  We will come back to sample other menu items.",

Bronzino was cooked over a wood charbroiler, served whole with head on, de-boned and cooked perfectly.  Old world heavy crusted dinner bread made in own bakery on site, tenderloin tip & mushroom risotto was excellent. Breakfast fabulous with of course fresh fruit and real maple syrup.

And the desert was as delicious as the entree, we had the Dolci Trio. So if you're ever at the NYNY Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas, NV, this is a must try restaurant. Ask for Lidia C, she was outstanding.",

There happened to be thunderstorms that had passed by locally during the morning hours and so I don't know if that caused this place to be so busy on this particular morning,  but the people behind the counter seemed to be a little overwhelmed by the wave of people waiting for coffee and pastries...  The croissants here are not very good, they are more like bread and very heavy and doughy.  I had a ham, cheese, and egg croissant and I couldn't taste the ham, it was mainly poorly scrambled egg. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CuohP_W_UJoUowNN3TRpMg?select=5RMTiaPNBW4I2jxk7rXw8A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Cuoh...</a>  The cheese was very bland it there was any at all.  I've been more satisfied with the breakfast croissant at Jack-n-the-Box than at this place.  The cafe latte that I ordered was not very good either, it was scalding hot and tasted pretty thin as if there was too much water...  I told you that they seemed to be pretty overwhelmed in back;  neither the regular small tables that littered the side of this small outpost of Il Fornaio nor the communal table in the middle were tended to or cleaned up after, we had to fend for ourselves and wipe up any leftover crumbs or spills from previous patrons...  It was only by chance that we stopped here in the first place but I wouldn't recommend the croissants...",

Gary checked in on us a ton of times! he even walked by a few times to teach my kids some Italian words.  He was really nice, the food was just \"okay\"   I would return and try a different dish another time.  The pasta Fagioli Soup was good, the kids had a Margharetta pizza which was good, I had one slice of theirs.  We ordered the brushetta appetizer, I would skip this, we asked for only the tomato brushetta and no goat cheese or the other one on there.... which they did give us but it was not very flavorful.  It had too much pesto on top and underneath and the tomatoes had no taste.     I think the place has good food but not great food.  I used to live in NY and you definitely cannot compare it to a \"NY\" restaurant like Umbertos NY or anyplace like that but it was a good meal.  Also, soda and lemonade refills are not free, so be careful with that, my daughter got another lemonade and didnt even finish it and I was charged for three lemonades.... we ordered two of them but I didnt think there would be another one on there when she wanted more.  Most places on the strip and local restaurants like King's fish house do not charge for more soda.  We had a good dessert....... a trio something for dessert..... cannot remember the exact name but it had a scoop of vanilla gelato, a choc moose cake and some tiramisu and the dessert was really good.  That there was nothing left of :)",

We got the 3 course meal for $33 each.  The server brought bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, which was quite good.  We shared each part of our meal.  I got Minestrone Di Verdure (very good),   main course: Pennoni Alla Vodka (pasta tubes with creamy vodka sauce and bacon, excellent and cheesy too. Server ground fresh parmesan over the pasta.  Dessert: Tiramasu, which was chocolatey and creamy.  My husband got: Rustichella flat bread topped with goat cheese, mozzarella, tomatoes, red onion, kalamata olives, basil and oregano. Absolutely wonderful. Practically like a pizza.  His main course: Petto Di Pollo Al Peperoncino - OMG!!! This was the best tasting and most perfectly cooked chicken I have ever tasted and my husband agreed. It was juicy and practically melted in your mouth like butter. It gives me a reason to go back to Vegas and this restaurant.  My husband also had the Tiramasu for dessert, but he is not much of a chocolate fan.  The service was great and everyone friendly and helpful. I am still thinking about the chicken. Awesome!",

I mean I cannot pronounce it for you, all I could remember is that it had \"pollo\" in the title and by gosh chicken was in the dish!   The chicken was no dry or overcooked, but so tender and with the sauce to dip it in, even better. The noodles I had were also perfect, but whatever the sauce was, it was fantastic! I know that it had some type of wine mixed into it, which of course wine and me always bond well, but it truly was something I never tasted before.   This place is pricey for sure, I mean just my pasta was $18 bucks, but hey, so worth it! The service was great too. The little old man who waited on us was so adorable and he suggested the right wines with what we order and just made sure to really understand what we wanted because he was Italian himself and had that strong accent, but no problems really came about in the communication department! Woo hoo!   Overall, I loved the place. Had my eye on it every time I walked into New York New York and was happy when a family member decided to treat me to it! Gotta love family! :)",

They used the tough upper part of the exterior leaves of the artichokes rather than the hearts, leaving each bite with long, tough ribbons that were a bit like trying to eat palm fronds. Some of the pine nuts were burned. The veal roll special was supposed to be stuffed with ground veal, wrapped in pancetta, and finished with porcinis. Good concept, but the porcetta looked and tasted suspiciously like American bacon and the closest a porcini mushroom came to the flavorless dish was the menu description. Pretty much all-around Godawful.",

Ordered artichoke, proscuitto (dont care spelling) and mushroom pizza as always its good. Calamari was bomb. Service sucked the big apple.

Strike two: The waiter incorrectly stated I did not order 1 entree that did not come. It was late, I was with family, I didnt want to argue but I clearly did, it was the seafood pasta dish. He even said it for me when I couldnt pronounce it, and he said I didnt fucking order it! 3rd strike was my son asked for lemon wedges for his calamari...never arrived. Piss poor service which I didnt expect from this place. Don't think I will be back when I'm in vegas, it was real shitty service, or lack thereof.

They take reservations which is nice.  We had tickets to a show and I was concerned about the logistics of navigating Vegas on a Friday night.    The restaurant is bright and airy and pleasing enough.  you are served a verity of bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The bread was cold which surprised me, most Italian restaurants I've been to warm the bread.  There was one particular roll in the basket that we really liked and were brought a basket of just those.    I ordered the spaghetti balognese  which was good but really nothing to write home about.  My wife ordered chicken parmigiana which is an off the menu item.  Despite that, it was served quickly and was VERY good.    They had a pretty good wine list and while some of their selections are quite over priced by bottle, we found one that we were familiar with which I actually thought was even a bit under priced considering.     While we enjoyed our experience here, it is overall entirely too expensive.  Believe it or not, it was actually the bottle if wine that I thought was reasonably priced.    There is another place in the casino called Nine Fine Irishmen.  While it is also too expensive, the overall experience is enough to make me overlook the cost (to a certain extent).  Il Fornaio just does not offer the same benefit.  Had it not been for the excellent service that we received from our waiter Jefferson, I would only give this place a begrudging 3 stars.",

You have the option to sit outside and watch all the action going on on the casino floor, or you can cozy into one of the booths inside the restaurant.  What you will really like is the great prices!

    "text": "I would give more stars for service because my waiter art the bat was wonderful. Unfortunately the food tasted old. I got the shrimp with polenta, the pear ravioli and mixed grill from the prix fix menu. The shrimp in the first dish tasted like pour quality frozen shrimp. The best was the ravioli, great sauce, am dente pasta and the pasta tasted fresh. However, the mixed grill just tasted like days old fish. I got one shrimp with the head on that was basically meh and the sea bass, scallops and salmon tasted blah and had poor texture. Perhaps I am spoiled being from New Orleans but I have eaten at Il Fornio in Pasadena and Los Angeles and its usually wonderful. They need to step out up here!",

    "text": "Eh such a nice looking restaurant with mediocre food and bad service.   It was our first morning on our trip and after a long first day traveling we didn't want to go far and this restaurant looked like it would suffice. Looks can be deceiving.   We were seated immediately and looked over the menu. Since we were planning on hitting up Wicked Spoon for lunch I wanted a light breakfast and coffee. I ordered the Irish oatmeal which came with berries and cinnamon.   Service was alright in the beginning but towards the middle and end it seed like our sever didn't want to be \"bothered\" by us. He didn't like that we were drinking a ton of water and coffee and they needed to be refilled. We weren't finished eating and he dropped the check off. That is a huge pet peeve of mine.   The oatmeal was meh. It was watery and was super plain even with the berries and cinnamon. The serving was tiny maybe 1/2 a cup. I know I wanted a light breakfast but it wouldn't even fill a kid's stomach.   Price for the oatmeal was $9.00 and drip coffee was over $4.00! Come on I know it is Vegas but geeez.",

The service here is very slow and not friendly- I have to wait for a long time after l closed my menu and put it in the table and wait for the waiter to take my order. But I notice that other tables with more people seems to get the waiter's attention very quickly. I travel and eat alone a lot- I hate to think that people will treat you differently because of this, but that is what happened today. Perhaps people think a single Asian person won't tip well-but the truth is, people don't tip you well because you are not doing your job, especially since I have the similar job experiences before so I know what needs to be done, and apparently you are not doing it. The food ( breakfast) here is average with a price on the higher side. But the atmosphere is just not good nor comfortable. There won't be a third time for me to come.",

    "text": "I'm not sure whether to go with 3 or 4 stars here.  My wife and I ate here the night after I finished running the Vegas marathon.  I was in the mood for some good pasta and a good portion size.  We also went here because it was close to where we were staying.  It was good.  The free bread was awesome.  It was ciabatta and some rolls.  The rolls I didn't care about but the ciabatta was awesome.  We asked for a second basket and they gave us more.  I got the Minestrone soup to start.  It was good.  Not the best I've had but very fresh and light tasting.  I enjoyed it.  For the meal, I ordered the lasagna ferrarese.  I asked our waitress for a recommendation for a good portion size.  She recommended this.  The portion size wasn't as big as I had hoped; however, it was really good.  It was definitely plenty for any normal meal though.  With the bread, soup, and lasagna, I was full.  No question.    My wife ordered the Calamarata alle Melanzane.  I thought it was good, but it did have a strange flavor that I couldn't quite pinpoint.  We probably would have rather tried something else.  I know this place doesn't have the best reviews.  However, I wouldn't be afraid to try it again.  The service was great and very efficient.  The food was good.  We had a great time.",

    "text": "I was in town in January for the Consumers Electronic Show.  After walking the show and the strip for two days, fighting crowds, illegals aggressively pushing handouts for call girls, & disorientating casinos I was in the mood to have a relaxing sit down meal.  Unfortunately I found myself plodding with my partners in crime through the kitschy and less than memorable New York New York.  Desperate for sustenance we somehow stumbled upon this oasis in the sea of madness.    Price for Vegas, more than reasonable.  Atmosphere, inside was sublime, a break away from the noise and flash of the casino.  Bread delivered with a high quality olive oil for dipping. Impeccable service.  The sight and smells of chickens roasting and spinning over a wood fired oven.  My Linguine Mare Chiaro (Thin flat pasta with clams, mussels, prawns and scallops; seasoned with tomatoes, crushed red pepper, garlic and trebbiano wine for $24) more than filling and compelling.  ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2F3rd-coast%2F4411067724%2Fsizes%2Fo%2F&s=bc3a258fca4e4214bab7c730e0e88666ff3c24602cbcc59607e26ed1d6ce2ef2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flickr.com/photos/3rd-co...</a> )  Is it the best Italian restaurant you will find in Vegas?  Probably not.  But it is the best food for accessible prices you are bound to find.  It is all about your preconceived notions; I expected too little and was shown how much a casino based restaurant can deliver.  For all the bitching about Vegas food and the restaurant prices, this is an oasis in a sea of mediocrity.",

On the plus side (and what got them a notch above one) is they had Saint Paulie's NA instead of the swill they call O'duals.  The host was nice enough. He sat us at a quaint table outside. Our server was terrible. I almost wanted to ask him, \"Do you want to be here\"? But didn't. It was so bad that we decided to stop ordering after the appetizers and wound up going some place else for the rest of our dinner.   I would eat here again if there were no other reasonable options...oh wait, they have soft pretzels at this casino. So yeah, I wouldn't eat here again.",

The food, I would say, is one step above Olive Garden quality--good, but not terribly authentic. (By authentic, I mean classic and simple.) I ordered the Ravioli alla Lucana and it was very good, but by no means tastebud errupting.  I will give props to this place for three things:   (1) the bread, warm and arromatic, and the olive oil, delicious (2) the service, our waiter was extremly attentive plus could speak Italian with my boyfriend, and (3) the limoncello is fantastic  Overall, I'd give this place a go if you don't have anywhere else in mind. There are so many good places to eat on The Strip, anyone would have a hard time choosing!",
