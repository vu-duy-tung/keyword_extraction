    "text": "This place was really good, especially after eating at the country club buffet in Prim Valley Resort. I got wine with my meal, everything was fresh, and they had a pretty good selection of foods (although putting crab legs in every station for seafood night does not count as an assortment). My favorite foods were the raw oysters, fried shrimp, maple glazed salmon (that might not be its exact name), and omg their expresso gelato was amazing!! I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee ice creams but I was so surprised by how good this tasted. I wouldn't et the Asian tuna it's quite dry and the oregano clams are not impressive but the other clams were good. I didn't try the red meats so I can't comment on those. The ciopino was oddly sweet and not bad but not amazing. I'd take a chocolate chip cookie to go on my way out. :) Overall, it's not bad for the price. I was happy with my service and the foods I picked so with any buffet eat at your own risk. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Not the best buffet... Not by a long shot. I came here on a Wednesday and it happened to be prime-rib night ($12.99/person).   The seafood that they had here was SAD. Battered and fried talipia, precooked cold shrimp with cocktail sauce, boiled flavorless crayfish, and overcooked, over-butter salmon.   The prime rib however, was cooked very nicely. They had two roasts, one rare and the other well done, so if you're not one of those people who love your meat bleeding when it's cut and served to you, you have another option. The other stuff at their BBQ section I would skip entirely. The chicken has no flavor and is overcooked to death.  The other plus of the buffet was the dessert selection which was PACKED with different kinds of pies. I think total, they had about 25 different kinds? You line up, tell the person what you wanted and they cut it fresh for you. Pretty awesome if you ask me.  At the \"Chinese\" section, you could select a bunch of raw ingredients and have them cook it up for you with was pretty cool. The chicken that they had here was suppppper tender so I'd recommend that.  I didn't care to try the Mexican section, the salad bar was messy and didn't look too fresh, and everything in the Italian section looked too greasy and looked like it sat out too long so I didn't care to try it either.  Overall, below average. Prime rib and dessert saved this place from getting a 1 star in my book. I do have to admit though, this is clearly a case where you get what you pay for.",

There aren't a lot of options compared to other buffets you would usually find in Vegas. I got two types of rice and they were both quite hard... I don't regret eating before the buffet.  I did like their soup; however it tasted like Campbell's, nothing wrong about that because it tasted great but again, this is a buffet in Vegas and there needs to be something special about this buffet. I'm thankful that Steak and Shake and Zenshin sushi is a few steps away.",

Some options are better than others. My husband tried several different foods from each station, including different types of meat, which always seemed to be fatty, and lacking any flavor. I really enjoyed the stir-fry, which tasted great every day, but found the pizza, macaroni and cheese, and potatoes to have no flavor. We liked that the buffet price includes a pop, and having had a hard time finding restaurants that serve Pepsi products, I love that they offered Mountain Dew. This buffet offers lots of options to choose from, and a large, comfortable area to sit in, but I would say the quality of the food could be improved.",

When I came there, they had roast beef, BBQ ribs, a large salad / fruit bar, and desert area. Garden Buffet also has a Mexican area (tacos / nachos) and a Italian area (pasta dishes).

There are stations for Seafood, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, BBQ, and Desserts.   The Seafood was fried oysters, dill salmon, cold shrimp, green-lip mussels, boiled crawfish, and not much else.  Tried a sample of each, and couldn't get past the first bites; the seafood was just either dry or tasteless. Chinese offers a made-to-order stir fry; we didn't try this.  Opted for the beef chow fun; it was about what you'd expect in a buffet.  They deep-fry the pot stickers - uh, no thank you!.   Mexican - typical make-your-own tacos with hard shells, ground beef, cheese and toppings.  Very average - the ground beef had a strange flavor.  Other options include enchiladas, green chile pork, and a few other items. Italian - meatballs, spaghetti, lasagna, sausage, and pizza.  Again, typical of what you'd expect from a buffet; sometimes dry, not much flavor. BBQ - besides the prime rib, they offered pepper steak, beef ribs, and pork ribs.  Sides include corn-on-the-cob, mashed potatoes, and stuffing.  The sides were all flavorless. Desserts - a variety of cakes, etc.  Typical buffet items.   The best items I liked were the prime rib (hard to screw that up), the beef ribs, and the green chile pork.  Passable on a few other items, but that's about it.   Even for a buffet, I don't think I'll try this place again.",

They also had scrambled egg whites.  Veggies are a bit hard to find. The service was great.  Refill on drinks were brought right away.  The second time we got there at 10. A sign said lunch was at 11. We figured that was enough time. After we paid they said to make sure we have all the food we want by 10:30. This time we got no attention fron the server.  No refills.  Half of the food was put away by 10:15. The only veggies available we at the omelette station  (which they happily gave me some). The food was ok.  Had been obviously sitting out a while.  We left at 10:50. There were 8 servers in our area and a manager.  Noone took plates from our table or offered to get us more drinks.  The second visit was not enjoyable but the food was not the worst ever.",

Some other meats in Carving station (Short Rib especially) are good too. Not too much seafood selection, only easy peel shrimp is served. However, Green mussel are good too, butter and garlic, my favorite. Pasta station serves great live action and has a very friendly chef. Asian Station has Mongolian Grill (or Tapanyaki) but a bit oily and salty. Very basic dessert selection but very nice. Overall, very good food for the good price.",

I'm usually pretty easy to please when it comes to desserts, but their selection was mediocre at best.

All Asian foods was cold and just seemed like it was from the night before. The clam chowder was ok. Overall this is worst buffet I've ever been to in Vegas and I've been to a lot.

I had to complete a report and talk to hotel security in order to possibly get a refund. Hotel security was very nice, but I wish the hotel had them working on more important things. The hotel wanted to know where I was sitting so they could have security review camera footage to make sure I actually ate at the buffet. LOL!!!   I was told that risk management needed to review everything before I could be refunded. Risk management  was out of town, so at check out I spoke to Shelly, the director of the hotel. She could not help me. She said they needed to call all the club member card holders who ate at the restaurant that night to see if they got sick,  and they needed to interview all the cooks to see if they knew of anything that went wrong.    I mentioned that this was poor customer service, and she told me she didn't want to make any snide remarks, handed me my receipt in a nasty fashion, and walked away while I was still talking.  She only spent about 1-2 min with me and was extremely nasty and unapologetic.",

    "text": "Not gonna complain, not the best but I came here multiple times during my stay!  Came to the Garden Buffet at the South Point while I stayed at the hotel on the weekend of the Amazing Las Vegas Comic Con.  When you stay there, you get a funbook with lots of handy coupons to use throughout the hotel!  Needless to say, one of the big draws is the coupon for the 50% off the buffet, any meal of any day during your stay.  They gave me TWO coupon books, so I was able to use this coupon twice!  Double the savings!  Nice!  Anywho, back to the buffet.  The Garden Buffet is by far not the greatest of buffets AT ALL.  It isn't on par with Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, or Wynn so don't even think about it.  But for me, it's OK.  Not everyone can charge that amount of money for a fancy buffet.  Pricing at the Garden Buffet is along the lines of buffets for Station Casinos.  But the quality of the food here is hit & miss.  Lots of miss, but a few bright spots.    First time I visited the buffet was Friday evening for their seafood buffet.  With the players club membership (free) it cost $24.95 plus tax, but with the funbook coupon it came in at $12.50 plus tax!  How friggin' cheap is THAT??  Plus it came with a glass of white or red wine!!  Look, I know it ain't fancy or high class but for that little scratch you sure can get your money's worth if you eat right.  And folks sure looked like they were.    People had plates upon plates (upon plates) of crab legs, oysters, and fried shrimp.  One guy I watched had three plates of just crab legs in front of him, a tub of melted butter, and another plate for crab leg shells.  I myself had several plates of crab legs, but also tried the other fare like prime rib, and little bit of everything else.  Quality?  Eh, not bad, of course the crab legs were are from pre-frozen but there were areas in the buffet where you could get cold crab legs as well as steamed crab legs.  I went for mostly steamed.  A squeeze of lemon & a dab of melted butter?  Not bad!  Best thing is the crab legs are already cut in half giving you precious time to eat more for less work.  Glass of wine was a nice touch.  The rest of the buffet food was just OK, nothing special but nothing of uber high quality or taste.  Their spaghetti sauce though is kinda off though, not very tasty.  Prime rib was a tad overdone for me too.  But a seafood buffet for $13 was one of the cheapest ways to eat at South Point!  Second time I ate at the Garden Buffet was my last meal on Sunday before I checked out.  Went to the brunch, which was an even better deal!  $15.95 before funbook coupon, only $7.98 plus tax after!  Also, with bottomless mimosas!  Get fed!  Get drunk!  For cheap!  I actually enjoyed the brunch more than the dinner because the food choices were more appealing to me.  I had a slice of prime rib, some BBQ ribs, and even a cook-to-order omelette!  It was actually quite good.  Many of the items on the buffet were subpar, but those few things did stand out.  Even got an extra mimosa to go!    The next time Amazing Las Vegas Comic Con is in town I'll most likely stay at the South Point again and partake of the funbook coupons.  Pretty good way to stretch your dollar on a busy Vegas weekend.  Yes a cheap buffet does usually mean cheap foods, but in the end...it's still CHEAP!",

My fella is a sucker for buffets so I decided to be a good girlfriend.   There was no line and we noticed that they offer a discount with a rewards club so we made sure to get one before we went. The prices weren't great, but we decided to still give it a shot. We were seated quickly and the server was very friendly and brought our drinks.   The line was pretty well stocked. They had a lot of variety, which I was little surprised by. It was a basic buffet, but unlike some of the more expensive buffets in town, they had a lot of things to choose from and it was better than expected. They have themed nights so that's fun. Definitely a better experience than expected. Not the best food or buffet in town, but a solid choice if you're at South Point.",

    "text": "If you are in South Point looking for a place to eat this buffet is not a bad choice. South point has a few great dinning choices and I would rank the buffet as my 2nd choice. First would be Steak and Shake, third is Don Vitos.   Lets talk about the Garden Buffet, You can not go wrong with the multitude of food selection inside this place. It has everything from seafood, Asian food, Mexican food Italian food, all American food and deserts.  I went on a Friday night which means it was King Crab night. Wow, I have never seen so many crab legs all for the taking. The 16 bucks for the buffet was worth the amount of crab we ate. There were over 4 areas were you could dish up the pre-cracked legs. Honestly next to the outstanding flavor that was one of the greatest things about the crab. Every single one of them were ready to eat. No cracking, no pulling and no work. Just devouring the savory King Crab!! They sure made it easy to pile my plate high.   The rest of the seafood was mediocre, and the Asian food was decent but laking in choices. It was limited to chow mien, fried and white rice, egg rolls and one seafood side dish that looked Way to lets say exotic for my taste! The sushi, well all I will say about that is I would have been better off buying sushi at the grocery store! The Mexican food was awesome they gave you the choice to make your own tacos, burritos or nachos with a good selection of meats and seafood.   The desert section was full of choices but by the time you get there let me make a suggestion. Get another plate of crab instead!! The cake slice I tried was terrible and so was the pie. I took one bite of each and that was enough for me.   The waiter service was OK, I think we just had a lady on an off night as the rest of the staff there were very polite.   All in all, if your in South Point and need somewhere to eat. This is a top choice. If you are just out an about for the night its not worth making the stop as there are so many options here in Vegas.",

The price was reasonable, about $13 per person for lunch (one star for this).  The service was not great, but acceptable. Our waitress took her time, but she was managing a large number of tables (another star).  They greet you with mimosas comprised of champagne and orange juice. The orange juice is from a bottle so it didn't taste that great (sorry, no star here).  Food quality not so great overall, oysters on the half shell were dry, but they did have prime rib (this earns another star).  To conclude, expect \"Home Town Buffet\".",

    "text": "Now that my parents live in Vegas, I have a nice place to stay (translation: since I don't have to pay for a hotel anymore, I have more gambling money).  Because of this, I don't feel the need to stay on the Strip.  That allows me to try out the \"local\" casinos.  South Point is one of those.  When my parents are too lazy to cook, we just head over to one of the buffets off the Strip, because they're so cheap.  Well, the Garden Buffet is one of those buffets.  Now, first thing's first, with Vegas buffets, you get what you pay for.  I've been to some of the $30+ buffets and I've also been to the $6 buffets.  Garden buffet is around $7 or $8 dollars on some days and as much as $13-$15 on weekends and special days.  Like I said before, you get what you pay for.  The quality and selection is that of a cheaper buffet.  But that doesn't mean that it's bad.  Instead of eating lobsters and steaks, I'm eating Chinese food and shrimp cocktails.  I would have to rate the food quality here a little better than average, except for the soup.  I've been here about 5 times and the soup always looked a little old.  I still tried it and it tasted like it looked.  They do have a big selection of desserts and they were just okay.  Also, another good thing about coming to a \"local\" spot is that the lines usually aren't as long.  And this place is no exception.  I would definitely come back here partly because the value and the quality is decent.  But the other part is for some reason, I always have good luck on the slots here.  Knock on wood.",

    "text": ".., I underestimated this buffet. But now after having eaten here, I feel it's underrated.   After a previous stay @ South Point, we were equipped w/ a handy little coupon book for our next visit. Luckily my gf remembered to bring it this trip & we scored on a free buffet gut buster during our stay here for the 4th of July.    I admit I was bashing on the Garden Buffet's name for it didn't sound promising. Being an obnoxious carnivor, the \"Garden\" part in Garden Buffet didn't sound tempting at all. Little did I know, I was wrong.  After working up an appettite during our little roulette/blackjack binge, we wanted to try out our free buffet coupon. It was free during the weekdays & it said nothing about any blackout days during the holidays. So we waited a smooth half hour in line chatting it up w/ fellow South Point visitors.   We were seated & hopped in the buffet line immedietely. I had myself a protein orgy!!!  Here's what I had from what I remember:  bratwurst w/ sauerkraut - excellent tons of bacon- excellent top round- eh, it was ok, tasted bland rigatoni pasta w/ pesto sauce- excellent scrambed eggs- excellent hashbrowns-excellent chicken gumbo- superb fried chicken- excellent Italian wedding soup- superb roast beef w/ au jus- tasty strawberry cheesecake- excellent  Service was attentive, not your typical balls out fancy buffet, but it got the job done. I was very pleased with this buffet, especially with it being free? We will definately come back! Staying @ South Point? Check em' out!",

    "text": "Overall, this buffet was better than I expected only because of their prime rib & rare new york steak. It was the best pieces of food I had there to eat during this buffet - only when it was medium rare, when it is most juicy & tender. The first piece of prime rib I had was chewy cuz it was pretty well-done - definitely not the type of steak I like. But when that more rare piece of meat came around, I HAD to try it, & it was great with the au jus dipping sauce.   Their bostom creme pie is worth trying.  So is their shrimp w/cocktail dipping sauce.  Everything else in the buffet was just okay or less.   Drinks: We ordered OJ from our waitress, but it was so watered down. That OJ did not taste fresh nor did it come with any ice. It was most DEFinitely from concentrate. Then the apple juice my mother-in-law ordered was diluted. x| However, I ordered their cranberry drink another time, & it was MUCH better than the OJ & apple juice. Their Nestea rasberry iced tea was okay too.    Price wise, it was okay. $14.95 per person for Mother's Day brunch.   Would I go back again? Probablay if I get super good coupons (i.e. 50% Off Coupons)!  =P",

However, given the fact that the hotel itself is pretty far south on Las Vegas Blvd. and isolated plus the discounts available if you become a Club member, it wasn't a bad choice.   We recently drove to Vegas to get married and stayed at the South Point Hotel for a few days before and after the ceremony. We took advantage of the free Club membership and wanted to utilize the coupons and discounts we were provided upon check-in therefore dinner on the first night was at the Garden Buffet.   They have various stations including Seafood, Asian, Italian, BBQ, etc. so there was a good variety of food available for every taste. The unfortunate aspect was that it wasn't very tasty. We had breakfast there the following morning and although not that impressive, it was better than the dinner the night before.   The final night there we decided to give the BBQ a try and were sadly disappointed. In our opinion, the Seafood dinner was far better and tastier in comparison.   All in all, the price, convenience and service are the reasons we tried the Garden Buffet but I must say that the quality and taste of the food was very lacking.",

    "text": "Located in the Casino level of the Southpoint, this buffet is priced right for what you get.  It has Chinese, Mexican, and Italian sections, as well as a salad bar, other more \"American\" stuff, and soups (during lunch and dinner).  At breakfast, obviously, the offerings are different.  But I can't imagine coming into this place with a hankering for a certain taste and not finding it.  There is plenty of protein and even a Mongolian BBQ grill.  We didn't try it but it looked intriguing.  Before paying and going in, get a club card and a coupon book.  It's free.  In the book, you'll find a coupon for free lunch and breakfast M-F. Each coupon is good for two people so if you and your partner sign up, you'll have more than one free meal if you're there during the week.  The front-end is a bit chaotic, with employees at the top of the line yelling over a wireless communication system, for other people deep within the dining room to locate appropriate tables.  It seems, no matter what time of day you arrive, you'll stand in line.  I'm not sure why... often the restaurant isn't full.  Go by early morning on New Year's Day.  80% empty and still a line.  That is a testimony to the inefficiency of their table assignment methodology.  Our service varied.  The first time we went there, we had to beg the guy for drink refills.  The second time, the lady was right on it.  In fact, she simply brought us a pitcher of iced tea for our table.  What a concept.  It's hard to recommend specific dishes, seeing as how they vary the selections from day to day.  I did enjoy the clam chowder.  It was quite savory, with plenty of clams.  You can get good-sized tail-on shrimp in the Chinese section and put it over a salad for a nice shrimp salad.  They also have a good taco bar.  I broke the taco shells and made a tostada out of the meat, beans, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, and corn (from the salad bar).  The taco meat was really good.  They also had tortilla chips and guacamole.  Both were pretty good.  I'll never understand why people bring stroller-aged children to Las Vegas.  Seems the smoke inhalation alone would kill them.  But, no, I see people cruising the casinos with kids screaming in strollers.  Hey, I'd scream too.  And I felt like it when a large family with one screamer couldn't shut her up.  Makes me feel like I'm waiting at the DMV when actually I'm just trying to enjoy my breakfast.  So one would think with the complex seating assignments, they'd come up with a way to put people like that in a padded room or something.  Sigh.  Oh, and then there is the element of society that goes in there to steal food.  Unbelievable, one little old lady in a double-knit suit boldly went up to the pastry area and put a stack of at least 10 bear claws on her plate and took them back to her table.  5 minutes later all were gone but her giant purse sure was fatter.  She repeated this several times while we were having our breakfast.  Isn't anybody in there watching for that kind of nonsense?  If my college aged son tried that, he'd probably get booted out by Security within minutes.  Reverse age discrimination.  Let the cheapies get away with whatever, subsidized by the ones who play by the rules.  It's a turn-off and makes it look like the hotel / restaurant could care less.",

Nothing was terribly tasty but I've definitely had worse (for more money). I enjoyed my salad, enchilada, deep fried ravioli (best idea ever, btw) and mini cheesecake.  Fish didn't look amazing so I stayed away (a rule I hold True to when dealing with suspect seafood) and service wasn't amazing (took forever to get a drink refill) but otherwise, I think this is an ok place if you're in the area and need a cheap meal.",

The poke was an insult to poke; the fish was cut more appropriately for lomi salmon, not poke. I was really rooting for the portuguese bean soup - salty. And the poi! That stuff is too labor intensive and expensive to waste. But it tasted funny and I saw a LOT of folks leaving it in the bowl - me included. I'll just stop there. I really don't want to beat it to death, but SOUTHPOINT FOOD AND BEVERAGE MANAGEMENT...ATTENTION: You gotta do something about the quality of the food. Remember, your target audience on luau night are people who know the food, know how it should be and won't accept anything less. Little things, like a bottle of soy sauce where you have the poke and mac salad or chop sticks where you have the chicken long rice. Have you ever tried to eat that with a spoon? Find some good Hawaiians (get plenty around), give them the resources and freedom to do what they need to do and let 'em cook! Until I start hearing otherwise, you've lost me, my family, and all my friends. Please, I beg you, earn my trust back!!!",

    "text": "I see I'm going to have to rescue this place from some bad recent reviews.  We live nearby and we eat here at least once or twice a week. It's not the M Buffet, nor does it try to be. Nor is it $35-45 like some Las Vegas Strip buffets. It's just our go-to place for consistently good food and service at a great value. Like the Holiday Inn commercial said, the best surprise is no surprise. If you want fancy, or you're just burnt out on Las Vegas buffets, the South Point has nine other restaurants.  Currently the Garden Buffet is $7 for breakfast (7A-10A); $10 for lunch (11A-3P) and $15 for dinner (4P-9P, Sat until 10P); special nights (Monday, steak, $17; Friday, seafood, $20) and weekend brunch (8A-3P Sat-Sun, $15) slightly higher. Beer and wine available for purchase. Prices include players' card discount, free to those 21 or over. You'll need one players' card for every two adults to get the discount.  Free Bloody Marys and Mimosas included with weekend brunch (again, if you're 21).  Soup bar typically has chicken gumbo and white bean chili, sometimes split pea and pasta e fagioli, sometimes my favorite, BLT soup. Large salad bar.  Seafood section offers peel-and-eat shrimp, mussels, baked salmon or swordfish, fried scallops, sometimes baked mahi mahi or trout. Next is the Asian dept. with chow fun, pad thai, or \"General's Pork.\" There is a Mongolian grill whose chef will custom-fry your veggies with chicken, shrimp, and/or beef. Mexican bar has enchiladas, and quesadillas; Italian consists of linguine and tortellini offered with alfredo and marinara sauce, and pizzas. Carving station offers prime rib, beef round, brisket, turkey and ham depending on the day of week and time of day, also beef short ribs, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, prepared horseradish, Brussels sprouts, bowtie pasta with London broil or pork chops, Last is the dessert bar with bread pudding and assorted pies and cakes.  Friday is seafood night featuring all-you-can-eat hot and cold crab legs and other seafood items such as halibut, baked trout or crawfish.  Tip: Come at lunch Fridays and you'll typically find all the seafood items out except for the crab legs.  Your attentive waitperson will, of course, bring you coffee and soft drinks.  After your meal, catch a movie in the always-uncrowded cineplex located just steps away, or watch a ballgame in the sports book.  I asked the wife to comment: \"Honey, the last couple of people panned the place.\"  \"What? That's not fair. It's clean, they have great iced tea, the service is great, the food is great. I wish they had a little more variety, especially in the Italian and Mexican sections, but I really like the place.\"  Another Yelper commented: \"If you're ever in Vegas with someone that is undergoing the effects of a mind altering substance stronger than alcohol, bring them here.\"  With all due respect to the South Point, I'm not sure I'd select their club as a place to hallucinate. Especially not during rodeo season. But LOL.",

We have tried their breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets.  Nothing tastes very good.  Why do we still continue to eat here??  Two reasons.....the prices are affordable (especially when we have a buy 1 get 1 free coupon), and everyone else in the family thinks the buffet isn't too bad.  My wife and I seem to be the only ones who don't care for the buffet here.  The quality and taste of the food is sub par and mediocre at best.  Even the desserts aren't too good.   A positive thing is that I do not eat too much so I don't feel guilty.  Another positive is that the staff serving us drinks and clearing the tables have all been friendly.  Still, we will only come here if we are with family.  If it just my wife and I, we will go somewhere else.",

The price is $6.99 Monday - Friday, and absolutely worth no more on the weekend, especially not the $13.95 they charge.  The beverages (OJ, milk, coffee, water) all tasted like trash. The mimosa was so bad I coughed it out because it tasted more like a flat warm beer than either of the drinks inside of it.   As for breakfast on the brunch buffet, you have the option of 3 day old muffins, undercooked scrambled eggs, or an omlet from the station after you wait behind the 25 other people trying to find something that won't make their stomachs turn.  Don't bother even looking at the sign to this place unless you're desparate for food and have and iron gut to handle the immensely dissappointing substitutes for food.",

Waited around 20 mins to be seated.Paid $16 dollars without club card per person. Huge dining area with comfortable seats and surroundings. Wait staffs are courteous and nice. The food selections are abundance.They have your typical buffet stations like American, Italian, Chinese, Mexicano, and Carving station which they also grill your steak to your liking. That is a huge plus in my book. I especially love the tender baby greens they served. It is so fresh and good. The Vegans in my family were all very happy about it. I had a juicy steak with champagne. The steak was just perfect and the champagne was very bubbly, and not flat. Overall, I had a very satisfy experience eating at the Garden buffet at South Point! Even though , it was a bit far away from the strip.It was well worth the $8 dollars shuttle ride each way.",

I was second in line. Looking forward to crablegs split in half there and clams. I didn't realize when they are split like that and air hits them they get dry. That isn't their fault though. What bothered me was they close a hour before dinner. I ate chicken and prime rib that seemed old and dry only to go back later where prime rib was fresh as was the chicken. Led me to ask myself why I was the second one there and got food that tasted old and dry. Could they have been serving us the old leftover food from lunch,  waited till it was gone then pulled out the dinner food which we pay ten dollars more for? I was already full and definately not going to eat again so I'll never know what the fresh food was like. Looked wonderful though. Sorry guarden buffet. I took my mom out for her 88th birthday after recently loosing my dad, her husband. I wasn't up to shenanigans. I liked gambling there in the past but will skip the drive now and stay close to home. Won't be returning. Sometines I just don't want to be fooled!",

Every day is a brunch with non-breakfast options especially in the Asian section.

Here is another sad fact if you go to a buffet that also welcomes timeshare resorts to offer free food to you in hopes that you will purchase a timeshare.....I would probably stay away as well. Now with all of that being said the food was not bad especially if your not VEGAN as I am. However we were able to find some pretty good breakfast potatoes....grits.....polenta.....Bagels.....and coffee. The prices (if we were buying) were not terrible just average for just like any other Buffet in Vegas.  That's all I got people....Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",

The average rating pertains solely to their food, which is super satisfactory (some bland or over salty, others not so bad). Selections are split up with BBQ, Mexican, Asian, Italian, and Seafood cuisines plus great dessert and salad bar!  Dined in for their Seafood buffet (Fri and Sat nights) with AYCE snow crab legs. The kind that requires piling 20 legs on your plate and tediously carving out skimpy crab meat for a full serving. Salmon is Atlantic which is the cheapo kind. Boyfriend said prime rib is good!  Bright spot: service is great! Sweet, chatty ol woman worked quick to serve and bus tables.  **TIP: Sign up for a free SP Player's Club Card to get up to $5 off buffet price.",

    "text": "So, I'm sitting here in Las Vegas, with a case of LA disease. Thanks to the Garden Buffet at the South Pointe. One good thing that'll come out of this - I'll drop some significant weight before the new year even starts.   So, what's the LA disease you're probably wondering ...  It's a term I either coined or picked up and use whenever I eat something that ends up giving me the runs. Or in other words - liquid ass. Some even call it the stomach flu. Whatever the case, it's like that line goes from that one movie ... I'm a stomach flu away from my target weight.   Anyway - my Las Vegas family, party of 10 arrive and surprisingly only have to wait 47 minutes to be seated. There were a lot of large parties in front of us, including a party of 20. Not too bad - their staff shuffled empty tables around like you move blocks around in Tetris.   The wait staff was pretty good too. Thus the one star. Our server didn't write drink orders down but remembered them correctly brought them out quickly. She was also clearing plates and making some small talk. I didn't ask her name but she provided good service.   But the food ... or what I'm referring to as the food.  I had one plate. Not even a full plate. It wasn't that I wasn't hungry, because I can always eat. I had a scoop of two different seafood dishes - a large slab of rare Prime Rib and a few slices of roasted turkey. I could have gotten sick off anything but it's not the point - I didn't like the dishes nor the rest of what was offered, so I didn't grab anything else except a slice of Banana Cream Pie and some Soft Serve.   It was my first visit to this property and likely my last. This stomach ailment will pass just like I'll pass on eating at this place ever again.",

    "text": "Don't waste your time or bother eating at this nasty buffet at the Southpoint casino resort, your better off eating at the cafe or many other spots within this place! This is absolute the worst dinner buffet I've ever eaten in Las Vegas period.. We came in on a Monday night at around 7:00pm knowing they close at 10pm from what they advertise on there website, well that's not the case, they literally start shutting down & I mean putting away the food & dessert closer to 9:30! The salad bar doesn't have much to offer & the greens (spinach, romaine & iceberg) looked old like it was reused days before. The pot stickers were super dry & very hard, wouldn't surprise me if those were old and reused from days before also & reheated! They had Garlic bread near the pastas that was also hard as a rock & could be old as well, chilled shrimp to peel didn't seem Fresh as well. Prime rib & Turkey from The carving station was just nasty & terrible! Pizza was the same as the garlic bread & potstickers, My 2 little kids love those food items & as soon as they took 1 bite of each, they stopped eating it & refused to eat anymore. Honestly I didn't see anyone put fresh food out the buffet since we sat down around 7pm!. The people who worked behind the buffet line didn't seem friendly at all, they seemed like they didn't want to work as they were busy making conversation amongst themselves. There's a lot more food items that were cold, dry & old tasting believe me, just not gonna even bother describing anymore & let you be the judge if you dare, but I hope you take this as a True warning & stay far away as you can from this lousy buffet! The Silverton is way better than this place by far & is even a few dollars cheaper across all meal times! Also the service sucks! If I could rate this a 0 star rating I would!",

Yes, I know prime rib is supposed to be red. But it was literally raw and it made me sick. All of the food was terrible and old and some of it slimy and not seasoned whatsoever. But what can you expect from a cheaper buffet in Vegas? Not much. The raw meat situation shocked me though and I'm just appalled. Don't come here or else you'll get sick. You're better off going to McDonalds or something. That's how tragic the food was.",

If you chose wisely you'll have no problem selecting something healthy and fresh.  Our server was five stars and jumped on dirty plates within seconds.  The sweet potatoes were not over cooked, the salad bar attendants kept the bins full and clean.  I enjoyed the coconut cream pie filling, the fresh horseradish for the prime rib and shrimp cocktail.  Beer and wine is included.   Probably biased but everyone thought turkey was good.  Nothing memorable but for the price I don't think you can beat it.",

I actually ended up here because it was Thanksgiving weekend and all the buffets in the hotels on the strip were crowded.   Now for the buffet... They have a reasonable selection and variety of food at a slightly above average taste. Staff was very attentive at refilling drinks and picking up plates. You also get a ticket for one complimentary glass of wine with your meal. The buffet is a little cheaper if you have a South Point Club Card also.",

It was definitely not the best buffet I have been too (we go to a lot of buffets) but it wasn't the worst either...  They had a lot of choices: seafood (they had crawfish yummmm!), mexican, italian, omelet bar, asian, primerib, bbq station, salad bar, and desserts of course (even sugar free). There was definitely a lot of choices...best part was the bottomless mimosas...and for some reason...these were the best mimosas I have ever had in my life so far...Idk if I'm getting used to the taste of champagne or If these were just good to begin with...I def got a tad bit tipsy haha  If you were a paying customer...$15.99ish for Sunday brunch if you were a club member at South Pointe..if not $19.99ish",

    "text": "How do you ruin bacon?  Had bacon from three different spots on the buffet and it was limp and overdone.  That is hard to do!  Tasted like it had been cooked the day before and then microwaved and thrown into the heating trays (on top of bread which is always appealing).  The sausage patties were grey on the outside and pinkish on the inside.  They were slimy and tasted like something you would get in a school cafeteria or perhaps a penitentiary run by a cheap warden.  The link sausages were barely cooked.  The majority of the fruit was from a can and dripping with cheap sugar water.  I imagine it comes in large 5 gallon metal containers.    The scrambled eggs were cold and a little runny.  The boiled eggs still had the shells on them.  The oatmeal and grits looked identical - grey, mushy and lumpy.  While it is a large buffet most of the items are repeated a few times so there isn't much variety.  They did have a station making fresh omelets if you were willing to wait in line.   They also had some strange selections for 9 am such as lunch meats, fried rice and an ice cream scooping station.  A healthier choice probably would have been to eat an ice cream cone.  While it was fairly cheap at $8.95 I would have enjoyed a sausage mcmuffin meal at McDonald's a lot more than this meal.  Fortunately, since eating there 9 hours earlier I have only thrown up into my mouth once.",

Deserts were amazingly dry. Must be a captured audience and lower prices during construction that draws customers.  Again, we were very surprised.",

Access from the parking lot or garage is fast and easy. It opens at 7AM. The atmosphere is relaxing in a large, clean, and open setting. Decor is very colorful and table service is excellent.  Breakfast food quality is generally excellent. There's a large selection of American, Mexican, Asian, and European breakfast foods. There's also an impressive array of fruits, cereals, and miscellaneous side items - something lacking at many other buffets - even on the main strip. The only breakfast item I don't find is small diameter link sausage. (The large diameter sausage is too much bulk.) There are conversational omelet chefs. The serving counters are kept clean and food trays are frequently topped-off. There are complimentary Bloody Mary's. It's one third to one half the price of the fancy strip breakfast buffets and price competitive with other off-strip properties. It's a great place for a relaxing breakfast or a fast breakfast - quick in/out.",

Its pretty cheap for all those who are leaving Vegas on a losing streak. When you first walk in you can grab a Mimosa or champagne. They have 4-5 different sections to choose from: italian, seafood, mexican, american, and dessert. It offers something for everyone. For breakfast, the food here is decent!",

The salad bar could have been better, but other then that it has the basics of a buffet and those were done decently.   Maybe my expectations for buffets are lower, but for $13 it's not bad.",

Juicy, nice color, and tasty. If that's all you want with a few sides, this will be a fantastic buffet for the price and i would give it a solid 4 stars. Unfortunately, 90% of the other food was slop and the chefs and management need to make significant improvements. They probably make themselves better food for their families at home.  They had buttered noodles that would had been great topped with parmesan cheese that i couldn't find anywhere.  Asked the waitress for some parmesan cheese and she was too lazy to get some for me...pure laziness.  She just kept yapping with her coworkers, while the place was dead slow. I still tipped her 20%, but she deserved zero, and so overall this place gets two stars. If I'm nearby and hungry for prime rib, I may give it another shot but won't have high expectations on anything else.",

Are there food items that are bland or blah? Sure. What buffet doesn't have some dish that somebody out there doesn't like. The majority of the food is tasty and there is more than meets the eye. For example, you can customize your stir fry entree in the Asian section (pick what you want and the chef makes it right there in front of you). The same applies for omlets and the Italian/Pasta section. Talk about having your meal your way and just how you like it! There is a classic salad bar with all the fixings. The prime rib is awesome...better than what I've had at other buffets...seriously! Great crab legs on seafood night and plenty of choices!  Their deserts are ok to good. This buffet has more of a generic dessert section compared to some buffets that are offer exceptional desserts. Their tiramasu is actually very good and the last time I was there they had tiramasu shooters. Now those were good! I hadn't seem them before.   Service was great and no better or worse than any other buffet. We've eaten here numerous times and plan to go again and again!",

In fact, that is the only reason we ate here, and the only reason I wasn't angry about the food quality when I left. I guess this falls along the lines of, you get what you pay for. The food was bland and very under seasoned, no matter what themed section you went to. They didn't have a large variety like other Vegas buffets. Their dessert selection was lacking. I went on seafood night, and though they had crab legs, they were not kept very warm and so I ate cold crab legs. The fish I had was dry and needed seasoning. And the only vegetables in sight was a dish of unsalted green beans.",

My family and I stayed at South Point on Christmas Eve, and the four of us were each given a coupon book with discounts at the various restaurants, cafes, activities, etc... One of those coupons was a 50% off coupon for Garden Buffet, so we decided to go down and try it out. The Christmas special buffet was something around $20, but with the coupon, we ended up only paying $10 per person. I should mention that they require you to be 21 in order to use the coupon, however we just told them everyone was 21 and no one was the wiser.   The buffet had a few stations (seafood, Asian, Mexican, Italian, BBQ, and dessert). I mostly hung around BBQ for their prime rib and rib tips. The Asian station had a make your own stir fry that was also pretty good. Desserts were standard with a bonus gelato bar. Our buffet also came with 2 drink tickets per person for glasses of wine (no doubt to get all the 21+ in a happy gambling state). You really can't do much better as far as $10 meals go.",

The Garden Buffet at the South Point seems to have gone down since the last time I was there. Granted I don't frequent buffet's all that often I seem to recall my last visit being more enjoyable.  I was there during brunch hours so it was a combination of breakfast options and what I'm assuming are dinner offerings. The food was okay but not good enough to write home about. My expectations are tailored being that buffets are more about quantity then they are quality. Will I visit again? Likely but not as a first option.",

    "text": "2 1/2 stars  Wanting to finish off our Vegas trip with a buffet, but not at a huge price since we spent it on the weekend already, we came here upon my friend's recommendation of it being a decent buffet.  Coming in the building, I can tell that it is a lot older than most of the ones on the strip. They were under constuction and putting in really nice plushy carpet though.  Anyways, there was no wait when we got there so we were seated immediately. I liked that they buffet had different stations - Mexican, Asian, Salad, Seafood, Carving station, American...  The food though was mediocre. It was all edible, but I felt it was hard to choose something that I actually liked to go back for. For the most part, it was well seasoned and cooked alright. But as i said, nothing really worth going back for.  The desserts - uhhh... questionable. We got ths one lime green pie/cake looking thing and our fingers literally bounced back when we poked it. It was like a floamy spongey piece of dessert if that even makes sense. Weird...  Overall, it was eh... for the price (a little under $15 for lunch I think) it was alirght, but I actually rather spend a little more money for a better buffet.",

(Then again, maybe not...).  This casino must cater to Asian clientele as they have \"breakfast\" (eggs, sausage, ham, omelets, donuts) and chow mien, egg foo young, egg drop soup... in other words, real food .  I hate starchy American breakfast food so, thank you, Asians for staying at South Point! :-) (Now, if they could only attract Italians...)  I would definitely eat here again. It wasn't the highest quality food but the variety was good and the quality was acceptable.  This buffet is much better than the one at the Luxor, Circus Circus and Freemont (although their champagne breakfast rocks!).",

There are a few exceptions to this rule, and there are some buffets in Las Vegas that exceed on quality and quantity. Sadly, South Point buffet doesnt quite it that mark.  Came in on their seafood night and was quite excited for their selection. I traveled to the various selections and sampled from the different \"regions\" of the world. Once I had sat and began eating, I was a bit disappointed.    The certian mexican dishes, Asian noodles and prime rib were the highlights. However, for a buffet, they didn't bring it. Every dish was bland boarder line tasteless, selection for each region was limited to very generic foods (Italian- spaghetti and meatballs/ tortellini/ pizza), and often times the food was just awful. The pies and cakes had a better selection, but a buffet should pride itself in their food.   Three stars because the staff is friendly/attentive, thr place is clean, and the layout is inviting. Food SHOULD match the same standards, but just falls short.",

This has to be the absolute worst I have ever experienced, even worse than the old Sahara had to offer (yeah, I go back that far to find something near as crappy as this).   The pork chops were dry and tasteless.  They tasted as if they had been out too long, but they had just been put out.  The salmon was OK, but again, very dry.  The brussels sprouts were bland and tasteless.  The only thing that had some flavor to it was the prime rib.  And though they offered mimosas with their \"Saturday Brunch,\" the orange juice was the cheap crappy stuff that you would never serve to a guest in your own home.  Yes, they were under construction, and several areas were closed, but still, there were long lines at around 1:30pm in the afternoon.  I would have hated to see the place around noon.    It's a shame that the buffet was so bad.  The casino itself is pretty good.  It's not too smokey, it's clean, lots of good stuff going on (like the car show I attended), but the buffet needs a major makeover and fast.",

Food wise, Green Valley feast buffet is overrated, Sunset Station feast has gotten worse - hate to say it but Fiesta Henderson buffet has better food than Sunset. My only complaint with South Point buffet is when the brisket is not cooked well - one staff at the meat station always gets it right, the other two hit or miss. Their beef ribs with their bbq sauce always amazing.Prime rib you can always ask them to grill it if you want it cooked more. Desserts are amazing.",

The sushi rolls had stale rice and no flavor.  I did like the coconut shrimp skewers and steamed clams, however they were always running out of them.  The included beer/wine was awful, I didn't even use my 2nd ticket. I can only get so excited for Bud/Bud Light and the wine was clearly of the box wine quality.  Somehow this is priced at $31, $35 with tax + tip.  A total waste of money - do not even try it.  Now the adjacent Japanese restaurant was very nice, look for that review as well.  If anyone from South Point cares about this review, I'm open to discussion.",

The salad bar was stale two days in a row old wilted veggies and warm items which were all supposed to be cold. The cheese and meats around the salad bar looked discolored and were warm this was actually a huge red flag, I highly recommend not eating them. If you like meat, the carved prime rib was decent with creamed horseradish sauce. The carved roasted turkey was good too. The desserts look nice but taste bad....total bummer The servers here are all incredible and really work hard at making sure you have everything that you need.",

The fruits were fresh and sweet. The coffee was freshly brewed and they have half and half if you ask for it. I'm not a menudo fan, but my husband said it was perfectly done. Even the sugar free desserts were without the sugar free after taste! I cannot believe the quality for the price. Service was standard for buffet, but quality was excellent for breakfast!",

All of the fish was dry, the crab legs were terrible and also dry (explain that one) and and the rest was just plain bad. The only thing that had any flavor was the prime rib and the pepper steak.

You get drinks included in the price which is nice, as well as a decent dessert station. I think they need to improve their salad bar which is weak. Its well lit, so not for a romantic dinner, but more like being in a Police lineup. Please sign up for a players club, and you will get the discount price. Do you like wearing flip flops?

    "text": "This is the buffet place at the South Point resort.   If you're a club member you can get a discounted rate.    In Vegas there are tons of buffets of varying quality and expense.   Compared to the competition, this one would probably be considered in the lower mid-tier range.    We visited for a breakfast during mid-week in May 2017.   We received both the club discount rate, and then 50% off with a coupon we had.   For under ten bucks, we were able to stuff ourselves before the long day we had planned.   The made-to-order egg and omelet bar had two cooks that had a good system worked out between them such that the lines of waiting people were handled efficiently.    My customized omelet turned out tasty.    Carving station was operating that day and offered some ham, pork loin, and smoked sausage.   They were OK.   From the other serving areas, grabbed a couple different types of potatoes.   There was something called Campfire Potatoes which looked like it would be good, but turned out to be way oversalted to the point of being inedible.  Too bad.  From the fruit and salad stations, stocked up on some melon to go with the breakfast.     Free Bloody Marys were made available for the brunch.     The buffet has other stations offering dishes from various nationalities (Mexican, Euro, Chinese), but did not really branch out beyond the meat and eggs of breakfast so can't comment on those.    Overall, not a superb buffet, but for the discounted price we paid, we really can't complain.   Especially considering the dining option just next door is the Coronado Cafe where you can end up paying more for a single dish that you might not like at all.",

I thought the prime rib had way too much fat, the stir fry had way too much sodium, and the desserts just blatantly sucked! I actually liked the taco bar, and the seafood was decent.

So I figured Yi Mei Taiwan Champion Deli would be open to get some of that freshly fried chinese donuts (oil Sticks) and dip it into warm soybean milk.  Nope, they were closed as well...WTH, they are taiwanese!!!  So anyways, Southpoint is right across the street, so we'll just go to their breakfast buffet.  It was cheap, 2 can have breakfast for $15.03 + $3 tip. They didn't have my favorite breakfast item though.  It's the smoked salmon topped with capers on top of a cream cheesed bagel.  They had the salmon scrambled eggs (although this one taste better than the one I had bought at New Day Cafe, and is cheaper here too).    They have the regular breakfast item...nothing stood out...oh wait, their fruits were limited to apples, bananas, oranges, and thawed berries (hence, not fresh).  I had a small bowl of grits mixed with eggs, some salt and pepper, with a slice of wheat toast and was done.  What I didn't like was the fact when I was in line, there was a big kid that cut everyone and grabbed some bacon and placed it on his unclean plate.  Come on people...don't you read the regulation?  You are suppose to use a clean plate each time you go to get more food!!!  What's even more disgusting is that I saw a little kid, about 7 or so (in the age limit where there should be adult supervision!!), dug his hand into the bread basket, and touched one too many bread, and finally grabbed the prized bread to spread the land o lakes whipped butter on!  Parents!!!!  Please communicate to your children the etiquette, or simply comply with the regulation!!!!  Anyways, service was ok.  It's cheap, but I will be eating a breakfast bar instead.",

We went during the Saturday brunch, where they had a decent selection of breakfast and lunch items.  The buffet was arranged a bit odd, with the breakfast items sprinkled throughout, including in the seafood section. I stuck with lunch items, including peel-and-eat shrimp, prime rib from the carving station, super sweet watermelon, pizza... Unfortunately, I was too full by the time I noticed a Mongolian BBQ section. I also did not leave room for dessert.   There was a good variety of food and it was mostly good quality. Nothing was amazing and nothing was horrible. It was very basic.   The decor, like everything at South Point, looks like a cruise ship from the 80's.

It would be crazy to compare this buffet to the likes of buffets at Ceasar's or Bellagio where you'll pay about $50 per person. Considering the price, I don't have any complaints regarding the food.  Did I like everything I tried,  no. Did I leave hungry,  absolutely not.  We went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. There was a decent crowd but they were staffed appropriately so there wasn't much of a wait at any point.  The waitress did forget my fiances silverware when she brought the drinks but we were able to get some from another server quickky. The prime rib was delicious.  A little tough to cut with a butter knife but the flavor and wellness was prefect.  SIDENOTE: IF YOU WANT THE MEAT COOKED MORE WELL DONE ASK THE CHEF THEY WILL THROW IT ON THE GRILL FOR YOU! He enjoyed the seafood options (all of them) although he was really hoping for crab legs. The dessert section was decent.  Honestly, I think their dessert was better than Bellagio!   Conclusion: if you're in the area and looking for a decent meal at a low cost give it a shot.",

I feel like the staff should be helping organize that better or maybe they need to change their setup. I don't see myself returning unless the price were lower or South Point changes the set up.",

One has several different sausages, ham and pork while the other has your chicken, roast beef and turkey.  The salad bar is fresh and there is an assortments of fruits and other breakfast items, but we usually for go these items.  For the price, the selection and the fact that there are no crowds, this is an excellent choice for weekend brunch.",

You know taken out of the freezer spiced to hell then sitting out all day, then put back in the freezer .. repeat... it has that kind of taste.  I suspect they use MSg or something too in many dishes as I get really wonky even if I don't eat Chinese.  Dessert is ok... it's probably the safest bet if you don't want grisly meat or acidic coffee... Skip it if you can.

    "text": "I was in the area ...had a buy one get one free coupon so I couldn't pass on the savings. I had also never been to this buffet inside Southpoint Casino so I thought it was worth a try.   My plate consisted of their Prime Rib ( Wed is Prime Rib Day) , mashed potatoes, seafood salad, and fried rice. When I was eating the Prime Rib I thought it would be a good idea to mix fresh Horseradish with a creamy Horseradish. I was proud of myself for trying to be creative ..I continued to put a thick layer of it over my Prime Rib. I took a bite and tears came out of my eyes and my nose was burning. It was equivalent to the time when I first went out for Sushi and I thought Wasabi was avacado...big mistake then and now! I think from now on I will stick to A-1 sauce. I was trying to add flavor because the meat was a little on the dry side. The mashed potatoes were tasty it had little bits of red potato chunks in it which was nice. I also had the seafood salad but I was afraid to try it because it had clams in it. I eat clams but mainly if it's in a soup so this was different. It also had calamari, and I think crab . The salad had a nice creamy consistency to it but I couldn't eat more then two scoops. It was good but the after taste was getting to me. The fried rice was decent it was nice and dark ... I hate when Fried Rice is light in color it makes me think it will be tasteless.   I was so ready for some coffee and dessert after only one plate of food. I tasted their Coconut and Cookies in Cream flavored cakes. I was glad these were moist and spongy. The frosting didn't stick together in one big sheet ..that's another clue that it was fresh...so I was glad.   Overall the buffet was okay I did notice that they did have Crayfish that I was thinking about trying but I didn't want to get messy so maybe another time!",

    "text": "I stay at South Point regularly so I have eaten here many times. Anyone who pays full price should get a players club card and use the half price coupons they give you at check-in. When using both, Breakfast for two is about $11 and lunch is $13. That price can't be beat for an average meal with plenty of choices. Even dinner at full price for about $18 per person is fair. Service is usually great. This place gets bad reviews from people who don't know buffets or have high expectations and small wallets. Due to their inexpensive prices and free parking they get their share of idiots who think they are expert diners. If you're looking for a gourmet buffet experience head for the strip and enjoy. For everyday dining this is fine. Bottom line: You get what you pay for and I have very few gripes. Here are a few things to keep in mind:  Seafood doesn't age well. I have eaten at $50 seafood buffets with lousy food. If you want quality seafood served right don't go to a buffet.  Buffet eggs are usually runny and often made from powdered eggs. I don't like them either so I don't eat them. Stand in line for real eggs cooked to order or get something else.  Yes the Prime Rib is on the rare side. Simply ask them to put it on the grill and it will be served like you want it.  Food tends to dry out quickly on buffet lines. The catfish looked dried out so I didn't get it. The salmon next to it was very good. If you have to have a particular item, ask if they're putting out some that's fresh.  They have many types of pies that are not out. Just ask for what you want at the dessert station. If they have it, they'll find it and cut you a fresh piece.  The Grandview Time Share is right next door. If you eat breakfast on certain mornings after 8:30 a.m. you will see lots of time share groups. If you want to avoid the crowds get there before that.  Sorry, they don't have Dr. Pepper. If your entire review and dining experience revolves around that maybe you should stick to fast food.  I can't speak about canned fruit but the melon is great. Several options, ripe and freshly cut.  Tip your servers. They're nice people and they work hard. A few bucks per person isn't much to ask. Everytime I dine here I can't believe how many deadbeats don't leave a tip. These are the same people who tip a dollar for valet parking.  Finally, anyplace that gives out free meals to veterans and their guests every Memorial Day since they opened is rare. Other buffets occasionally do promos for vets but only South Point has done this on a regular basis.",

Brunch came out to about 19$ with taxes. Waste of money. And we were never offered are bottomless mimosas That was supposed to be included. It took her damn near 15 minutes to get us Waters to the table, choking on the salty food.   Soggy waffles and French toast sticks, if sat out for too long to become rubbery.   Bacon was the consistency of fried Band-Aids lol   Undercooked soggy hash browns.   Mash potatoes are already salted, I didn't realize that when I added salt to my meal. Gross. everything I ate was super salty.   The salmon in an Alfredo sauce was smelly, I could tell these were previously frozen fillets, overcooked, they smelled horrible, fresh fish shouldn't smell that way.   The cold prime rib was rare, a bloody, chewy mess. I can even handle medium rare but this was just too rare for me.   After second attempt to make another plate and we were equally as disappointed, we gave up and walked out hungry.    Quite possibly the worst buffet I've ever been too. Even with the discount due to construction it wasn't worth the money!!  I don't even understand how they could charge full price for this disgusting food.   Very limited selection due to construction.  Understaffed, lots of dirty tables.   Don't waste your time and money here.",

Prime Rib was dry and hard to cut, everything was ok taste wise, selections at stations could of been better, but other wise the people seemed nice, just busy, and they said thank you and have a nice night as we left.  Stations were Clean and food wasn't cold.",

    "text": "To all South Point haters: Being a local casino, for its price, variety, great selections and flavorful food and amazing dessert, which local casino you can compare it with? I'm a local and for three years I eat at local buffets for lunch 5 times a day and South Point has been our choice for years. We only go to others when we have coupons. We tried all the Station casinos, Orleans, Palms, etc. and South Point is definitely the best among them all. Green Valley is overrated and has few selections as well as the others. You can't compare it to M Resort because they don't have the same price. To others, don't get discouraged with the negative reviews. They don't know what they're talking about. South Point is the best local buffet.",

    "text": "There's a reason this buffet is so damn cheap. For starters, me and the fam got a voucher for signing up for the rewards program as our timeshare is right next to the Southpoint Casino. We went on the Saturday morning prime rib brunch, which was supposed to be 20 bucks, but the coupon knocked it down to 10 a person. The place was pretty empty when we went around 11am. Being the usual meathead I am, I headed right to the carving station and got some prime rib and a beef rib cause why not. The prime rib definitely needed au jus to moisten it up and make it taste decent at best, and the beef rib tasted like dog food. I also skimmed the perimeter and found a hidden gem in the beef fajitas and enjoyed those (but I picked out the onions and bell peppers since they were kinda mushy). For $10 it's not bad but the prime rib certainly tasted like food similar to my meal prep (aka meal-prepped chicken breast...oof) and I'm sure my cousin's pet dog would have enjoyed the beef rib more than I did. There was a pretty good selection though for you cheaters as I took notice of the dessert bar and heard very good things about the cakes and gelato (it looked meeaann, but I have self control lol). Overall pretty good for the value and if you need a cheap buffet fix.",

I hadn't eaten for almost 15 hours after flying all day and still was only able to eat a few French fries.  The waiter wouldn't allow us to use our drink coupons, stating the bar was closed.

It has many stations with different foods such as Asian, Mexican, Italian, Barbecue, Chinese and Seafood dishes, or the Mongolian Grill where you build your bowl of ingredients.  Prime Rib dinners are Sunday through Thursday. The carving station has flavorful prime rib that makes the meal for my hubs. I like little bits from all the stations.  The cold food is nice and cold and the hot is hot which is tough for a buffet. I love the Mongolian BBQ that tastes fresh and flavorful with your choice of sauces. YUM.   Friday and Saturday is the Seafood Buffet that also has the prime rib. They have plenty of foods that make it easier to choose healthy with peel and eat shrimp, crab legs and fish selections that are tasty. That usually is my meal. It takes time and energy getting the shrimp or crab legs out that I feel I earned the gelato for dessert. They have plenty of fresh fruit at the salad bar so I get watermelon for my favorite desert as well.   I do recommend the Garden Buffet at South Point. It's a nicer buffet with better than the norm foods.",

The variety of food was good with the major different cuisines you would expect at a buffet.  The carving station was just alright. The orange crepes were really good.

The selection was very limited for a $20 brunch  buffet. The regular fare for breakfast eggs, omelets, bacon, etc all of which were terrible. Eggs over medium was runny egg whites, eggs Benedict was cold & lacked any flavor, sausage was \"hockey puck\" tough, all the steam table food was way way over cooked and lifeless.  There is SO much more but I think you get the picture. The thing that really makes me crazy is that I could have gone anywhere else and for the money had a superior product.

Unfortunately, this is a buffet that has stepped down BIG TIME. First off, their crab. It looked liked the legs have shrunk and when you eat them, you can hardly get the meat off the shell, but when you do, the taste wasn't bad. My biggest gripe was their cocktail shrimp. My lady and I would come in often to enjoy a nice surf and turf dinner. Prime rib and some shrimp with some squeezed lemon on top and it's all we needed. It's now changed. There's no flavor when you eat it, it's soft/mushy and has no texture, and I got like 10 shrimp that had the CRAP VEIN still in it!!!!!! HELLO SOUTHPOINT! No one wants to eat crap! Literally! Thank god the fried shrimp and oysters were there to save the freaking day, pretty much the only good thing about the buffet anymore.  I really liked the dessert section, but it's hard to mess up. Great variety and they had good sugar free options. Thumbs up.   Overall, I'd rather pay more money and not have the quality drop like it truly has!!! Mostly everything was below average. They've truly turned a better than average buffet to a crap buffet. And that's literally what they wanted us to eat... CRAP. STAY AWAY!",

For the price, it's a bargain but you get what you pay for. Nothing outstanding here but they did have a made to order omelet station which was ok. The rest of the stuff was mostly oily breakfast food. The french toast was cold. The waffles were hard and dry. Service for getting drinks was slow and the waitress didn't bother checking on us.

Staff was quick to take money 30 minutes before end of brunch ($20 per person) and we got scraps and stuff that seemed to be sitting out for hours. It amazes me how many people wait in line for this poor excuse of a buffet. Waste of money. If you are a local, stay home and cook.",

I tend to stay away from dessert at buffets because the items tend to be sugar loaded and not very enjoyable... ahem, MGM : O  Overall the service is solid, value is great, and food is good with some exceptional items that make this place better then the 2.5 stars that is hanging over them.  I'm sure that this spot has had some bad days that probably contributed to the low rating but we went on a normal day and found a very satisfying meal that echoes back to what LV buffets were about.",

It's a basic buffet with lots of different offerings including seafood, salad bar, Asian, and other specialties. Unfortunately the food was extremely disappointing. It did not look fresh and several of the items that I tried including the Tuscan chicken and the beef brisket were very hard and dry and not edible. My lunch basically ended up being just the salad bar because that could not be messed up.   The prices are reasonably price for breakfast, lunch and dinner however it did not end up being a bargain since most of the food was inedible.",

We stopped on a Saturday evening, which is seafood and prime rib night.  While it's not dirt cheap, the cost is less than several strip buffets, and their selections are still really good.  Seafood night- oysters Rockefeller, breaded Scallops, breaded shrimp, Dungeness Crab (cooked perfectly and served warm), Prime Rib, plus all the other things you expect at a Vegas Buffet!  Lots and lots to choose from!  The food was about what you would expect.  However, the service here was amazing!

Everything I had was great and for the amazing lunch price of $11.99 with the card there's no way I could say no. The turkey was great not dry like at other buffets, and the Mac and Cheese was delicious. Pizza was better then any other buffet I've had. Their version of Rice Krispies treats was great and so were the warm apple dumplings. My son had the Reuben sandwich which he said was great. Our server Lucy was very kind and attentive to when we needed refills and taking away dirty plates. Definitely going to return, and you should try it out!",

    "text": "Quick review: It's not nearly as bad as you've probably heard. Considering the selection and the price point, you get a pretty good bang for your buck.  The obligatory buffet for South Point Hotel and Casino is the Garden Buffet. Inside the casino you will find it along the far back wall between the Oyster Bar and Steak and Shake.   We are Club Members at South Point and get their monthly flyers. For the past several month we've been getting a $15 off at any food outlet coupon. We went on a Monday night and enjoyed the prime rib night. After our coupon the total costs for 2 people came to roughly $22. Very good value there!  Drink service was swift and friendly and our refills were tended to almost immediately. As for the food, it's not that bad at all. Some dishes were better than others, but for a mid-tier buffet my expectations were already somewhat tempered. The prime rib was pretty good, as were the short ribs. The calzones were pretty tasty, but could have used a little more cheese. The mashed potatoes weren't bad, but a little too salty.   All in all, this place was alright. It's not a buffet to go way out of your way for, but I would come back with another coupon or promo.  It's A-Ok.  3 stars.",

There is a wide variety of food items and looks like it's been expanded. The center Island area which is usually just an iversized salad bar at most other buffets has been transformed to include other things as well including a station where you can get Reuben sliders... haven't seen those before at buffets!   My all-time favorite is still the Asian station where you can pick your assortment of vegetables and sauces and give them to the chef for Preparation with meat. I found that this buffet was very satisfying in not only the selection of foods but the quality and taste as well. This would explain the popularity.  The prices are very reasonable, plus if you're staying in the hotel and have a fun booklet you get 50% off. Each night they have a different themed buffet with lots of different selections that I have not seen other places.... so go enjoy their cuisine. I know i did. In fact I was just thinking to myself I don't go there enough!!",

Think they were pork ribs, though they were pretty big. All the food was high quality, fresh and tasted great.   At times, the waitress was slow to come by to remove the used plates and my soft drink ran out before she was there to fill it. Not a major problem.

    "text": "No.  It IS as bad as the reviews say.  Friday night: Seafood & Prime Rib  I sampled: prime rib, smoked pork ribs, smoked garlic salmon, glazed salmon, fried shrimp, fresh oysters, oysters Rockefeller, fried scallops, baked salmon, roast duck, Chinese vegetables, sushi, steamed won tons, made to order shrimp tacos, 3 flavors of gelato, bread pudding, and crepes, so I think it's safe to say I gave this buffet a fair try. Didn't even need to try the crab legs, obviously from frozen, the meat looked dry and was shriveled up inside and had pulled away completely from the shell.   The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that it smelled kind of fishy. Mm..not a good sign. We were starving, we purveyed the food and it all looked good! LOOKED. Huge prime rib fans so basically the fact that it was there was enough for us to sit down. Prime rib...I mean if a buffet serves it, it's usually at least halfway decent.  Prime rib was overcooked, cold, and chewy. Pork rib, not chewy, also not falling off the bone tender, also cold, and dry. No BBQ sauce? I thought maybe I missed it so I went back, I asked the chef behind the counter if they had bbq sauce, he went to the back and filled up one of those plastic salsa containers and gave me some bbq sauce...ummmm if you HAVE bbq sauce why is it not outside on the line NEXT to the PORK RIBS? Fried shrimp was pretty good, from frozen but good enough to eat as they were at least hot.  Smoked salmon did have a smoky flavor, other than that pretty tasteless. I sniffed the oyster and decided no. I sniffed the oysters Rockefeller and said MAYBE, I tasted a tiny piece and it was a no. Fried scallops, bleh, from frozen, bready and mushy on the inside :( The sushi, I know this because this I have done this exact same thing and gotten the same result. They are rolled the day or night before and put in the FRIDGE and then pulled out for service. THAT IS WHY THE RICE IS HARD. Also lacking in any \"expensive\" varieties. You know what I mean.  The roast duck was pretty good actually, it was hot, juicy, tender, and had the fatty skin on it. The Chinese Vegetables were pretty good as well (stir fried baby bok choy and baby carrots) the carrots were from frozen, but of all frozen vegetables to use, it is the least offensive.   Made to Order Station Shrimp Tacos..............You know those itty bitty frozen cheap shrimp that they use for popcorn shrimp. That was the shrimp they used for these tacos. I found these abhorrent little shrimps used OVER and OVER again in every single fucking dish of this buffet, mixed into pasta, served in tomato sauce, in cream sauce, in stir fry, the only exception was the shrimp cocktail. They used the worst possible choice of tortilla, first of all. They were these really thick and gummy flour tortillas that overpowered everything. The shrimp I don't think were seasoned whatsoever. Also they were not hot, and neither was the tortilla. If it's a \"made to order\" item, make it to order -_- The shrimps were already cooked, sitting in a pan, and he halfassedly \"heated\" my tortillas for all of 5 seconds. No he wasn't busy.   The crepes, oh god...another \"made to order\" item LOL. Looked good enough so we grabbed one. Ummmm why is it so hard? I tried to cut it with my spoon and it had gelatinized with the syrup that had been poured over it god knows how long ago. It smelled like fake citrus...and then I realized there were canned mandarin oranges sitting on top and I was done with that. I love how they present their ice cream in those metal pans like they're gelato, I'm not even sure what's in them can pass for ice cream. No richness, icy, poor mouthfeel, not creamy :( The bread pudding was pretty good!  I am beyond baffled. We paid $60 for the 2 of us and that was the \"club member\" price. Why on earth ANYONE would pay that much to eat here is BEYOND me. It's literally 5 more dollars to eat at Rio's Carnival buffet and it's ten times better, PECHANGA is cheaper and twice as good, a chicken sandwich from Carl's Jr. would have been better, ordering appetizers, entrees, and dessert at a fucking APPLEBEES would have been a better use of money. Literally, I wish we would have gone anywhere else. And this is what I get for not checking yelp before I eat.",

    "text": "As far as buffets go it is a wonderful garden of different flavors. Oh so delicious offerings from prime rib, tacos, sushi, rabbit food and ending with delectable dessert.  When one has teenagers, you understand that they are always hungry. Seems that if you have twin teenagers you get twice the fun. Basking in all that glory they were really hungry, I'm sure that the cold winter days do not help either. Thinking and hoping that this buffet will quell their green hulk healthy appetite, it appears I have a winner. There is something for all here. From the most finicky of esters there is something for everyone here. The diversity of different cuisines offered is so massive. As I said before one can have tacos and sushi, then a garden salad, don't forget all the desserts; plus what about the ultimate food there's always room for. Any guess? This food comes in a song! There's always room for, sing it, J-E-L-L-O!  The taste of the food here at this buffet is so mouthwatering deliciousness! As I write this, it resonates the tastes that I explored here. Such tantalizing temptation at every turn! The prime rib was what we explored this trip, with the experience being superb. As we were seated by the wait staff, it was a colorful booth that was particularly comfortable. The server took our drink order and it's off to grab a plate.   The prime rib was my first stop, having a meat craving at the time sounds like a good reason for steak. The prime rib was lean and as he sliced it the knife went through it instantly as if with no effort. The juices were delicious. I had to have potatoes and if you ask they will give you the prime rib juice as gravy if you want this. They have a brown gravy and a standard looking gravy that's white appearance looked better. The only way the prime rib could get any better is with it wrapped in bacon. They don't offer that on their prime rib here. Darn!  After prime rib the salad bar looked mighty good as I walked by with the plate of prime rib. The salad bar has fresh greens and so many choices. They offer spinach, a mixed greens with kale and spinach, then the \"normal\" looking lettuce. For my salad I had the spinach and kale mix and went heavy on the spinach. It's so good for you. The toppings are plentiful, from peas, cheeses both white and yellow, olives and the list goes on. I am an olive fan by far, here at the bowl of green olives let's see how my plate will look. Let's just say that it's all full. I am a big fan of cucumbers too. They leave some of the green part of the skin on the cucumbers that are cut into hexagons. They are so cute. With bleu cheese to top off the salad it's time to go eat the salad, with a side of green olives. Oh me oh my where will I put round two of the salad bar. The twins love salad too, they have already finished their plates and are here getting plate two on salad. Where do they put all that   Skipping to the good stuff, let's move to dessert! For those of us that can enjoy dessert with no issues, then we are the lucky few. For those individuals that still love dessert, but medically cannot eat it South Point to the rescue. They offer sugar free desserts. The sugar free treats are available in chocolate and raspberry flavors. Really I tried some of the sugar free treats and their was no difference in taste. All of the treats come in mini sizes with flavors such as fruit tarts, carrot cake, chocolate cake, a raspberry flavored something that really is so delicious. Did I mention the ice cream? No, I didn't. The ice cream is soft serve that only has three flavors of vanilla, chocolate, and twist. The sprinkles are a celebration of the rainbow these go on the top. Now that you have ice cream and cake with sprinkles it's time to find the spoon. Get set, commence eating!   As we walk back and forth indulging ourselves plate after plate, and round after round. Whom do we have to thank for clearing our plates. We have the diligent staff that just clears the table and then melt into the back ground again. These are the same employees that keep our water cups filled too. They ask for nothing, but are expected to do so very much. I want to take this chance and thank all the employees here for all of the wonderful work that they performed for my family during our dining experience. It made eating so enjoyable not having to move this plate or that one. They provided clean silverware each time so that for each course that we enjoyed we had clean utensils. This buffet has some of the best and dedicated employees that I have ever had the privilege to enjoy as a customer. The \"adult\" drinks I had to walk over to the bar and retrieve my own wine with the drink coupons I was given after I paid. Now cheers to enjoying it!",

The Garden Buffet is a lower tier buffet no where near the opulence of the Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon but no where near the price points of either as well. Today for Memorial Day the buffet was free for veterans and free is always a good thing, well almost always.  The atmosphere is friendly, welcoming, and clean with no extraneous frills. The service was accommodating, friendly, and responsive.  Today we had a freshly made omelette with cheese, jalapenos, mushrooms, onion, sausage, bacon, and olives. I customized mine by adding extra cheese, jalapenos, sour cream , ranchero sauce, and a respectable refried beans from the Mexican food station. The result was a delicious mound of excess that I finished off in record time. The buffet came with unlimited bloody marys. Perhaps I'm getting old but I had to stop at four and was only able to sample a very decent menudo. As I've said this is a bargain buffet so don't expect all the extravagance of high end buffets, but good overall.",

My parents and siblings wanted to come here  for dinner so I decided to tag along. If you have a players/rewards card you get a discount so make sure to get one or use yours if you have one.   I like the fact that there is so much more protein choices and an area where you can have food cooked for you (If you don't like oily food like me, make sure to tell them little on the oil).

It is our last resort after we go through the plethora of options of where to eat and none of us can decide what exactly we want so finally someone lets out a large sigh and says.... Okay, lets just go hit the Southpoint buffet.   There are a few things that I can definitely say are a positive for the buffet here.  1.) The Prime Rib is always perfect and they cut it for a cowboy not for a princess.  IE. I went to the buffet at Mandalay and it was the thinnest slice of meat I have ever been handed that was not over a deli counter.   2.) The wait staff is usually very friendly aside from one experience I had there we always receive great service.   Now for the \"meh\" details 1.) The selection really never changes 2.) The salad bar is lack luster  3.) Does anybody really eat those crusty craw fish at the end of the buffet?  4.) It closes at like 9PM. I know that is mostly due to it being a locals casino.... well that is what they say but I know damn well we do not have 398 Cowboys that all gather at the Southpoint every weekend that are all Locals. I know before going to a late movie There are times we would love to go grab some prime rib and veggies without having to go to the prime rib specific restaurant in the South point.   With all of that said, this is still probably going to be out go to spot to defuse those Hangry arguments we get into so regardless if they have tiny tidbits of salad toppings or Gigantic cuts of Prime rib it really doesn't matter because like I mentioned earlier it may not be your first choice but when your in a pinch you just have to go.",

But then when we went to pay the cashier who seem she was not sure if what she was saying she charging my 7 years old with full price. I think is not fair and id been to other buffet in the city and always they are charging kids half price and it was not consistent because as I said we went there 2 months ago and was charged half price. Either the cashier's  ignorance or management's inconsideration or overpricing that made the changes. Hope they reviewed their  pricing guidelines. its not worth paying  30 dollars for kids. or orient their cashier with the price .",

When we used the hotel stay coupons, and out players card, we only ended up paying like $8 with tax. Taking that into consideration, you get a lot of bang for your buck.   The food is average of course, but it was clean, bright, and covered all the basic buffet  options.   Surprisingly, I had some pretty good steamed cabbage.  I mean, it was on the level of southern grandma Sunday dinner. I know, crazy right? I even went and complimented the chefs behind the buffet glass. Hey, drink enough mimosas, and you are throwing compliments everywhere!   Would I go back to the Garden Buffet at the South Point? Of course, especially since they give 50% off coupons. It's totally worth it if you take advantage of the bottomless mimosas.",

The Mexican station is full of tacos, enchiladas, and whatnot.  Italian has spaghetti and lasagna.  Meat carving station has prime rib (way too salty) and turkey.  The salad bar has bleu cheese crumbles and bacon chunks.  The beef and broccoli is pretty damn good actually.  For seafood night, some cold crab legs don't justify the $5 price increase.

They had Asian, Mexican,Italian, meats and dessert bar.and salad bar. I got a small amount of Italian and Asian, then went to meat station and asked for a slice of brisket. There was absolutely no meat on it, just a giant slab of fat. Imagine the thickness of an Italian sausage. Yes, it was that thick. I of course didn't eat it, but what I did eat had me running ( literally) to the bathroom. I could actually feel my intestines moving it down to the to, well you all know where. Just thinking about it makes me nauseous. I've eaten in their restaurants before. This only happened there. Steer clear!",

My last few times visiting I was in the south and manage to eat here during breakfast and dinner.   The breakfast option has more than enough of a selection to me with the eggs Benedict being my favorite. Actually, the all-you-can-drink mimosas and bloody Marys were my high points here!....lol.   As for dinner, before even taking a seat, our waiter mentioned that their wine by the bottle was $6! Yes, that means a bottle for each person! Of course, it wasn't a top shelf selection but any varietal of Barefoot Cellers for that price is a deal and a good way to start the night. Oh, yeah, the dinner selection was good as far as I can remember.  Since this is also my first sit-down dining review, I will say that the service I received was a definite five star. Even though the food may not be up there as the larger casinos, the service is just as good and maybe even better from my experience.   Moral of this review is: it's affordable, there are bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys, and $6 bottles of wine!",

Buffet is not organized well at all, with people waiting unnecessarily across several stations, in order to get eggs or omelets. If someone wanted something from the blocked stations, they were chastised by the line people who thought they were cutting the line.   The food was not good: eggs were horrible, bacon underdone and greasy, sausage was overdone and dry. Potatoes were VERY underdone. It seemed like they were going through the motions, instead of putting good food out. I have been to truckstop buffets that were much better than this. And at 20 dollars each, we were highly upset.   The service staff and bus people were great, and seemed to know about the quality of the buffet. They kept giving subtle, but knowing looks,  when they heard complaints.  And management was accommodating, refunding half of the ticket.   Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this establishment, unless they make serious changes to their layout and improve the quality of the food.",

Recently South Point have been mailing out some very good coupons and since we had $10 of free slot play each and a 2 for 1 buffet coupon on the same day we decided our meal would be basically free so decided to make a return here for the first time in over a year.  Now, the last time I had been here I would have rated it four stars. The Asian section was good and the Mongolian Barbeque station was absolutely delicious and I was ALWAYS very happy.  Unfortunately I feel like America's economic woes have impacted the quality of this buffet. The previously amazing Mongolian station now serves up the most rubbery, fatty pieces of meat I have ever tasted, the Asian food is mushy and disgusting and the whole spread has become flat out uninspiring.  There's also a pasta station which can often be a saving grace of a lacking buffet, however they serve up the most bland creations possible and disturbingly the sauces for the \"made to order pasta\" are scooped straight out of the communal vats on the buffet.  On the upside, the salad station allows you to put together a tasty, fresh salad and the pink lemonade they have here is excellent.  I really feel like the quality of food served up here has taken a sharp dive. Garden Buffet has gone from a good quality \"away from the main strip\" spread to something getting dangerously close to the dire stuff served up at Excalibur.",

My gawd!)  She got a handy coupon booklet from them when she signed up for their card (I think).  We decided to take advantage of their Buy One Get One Free Buffet coupon for lunch on a Saturday.  There's nothing particularly fancy about this buffet like the big hotels on the strip.  It's a newer hotel though and it's buffet is decent.  And with these prices, it's a better deal than going out to eat.    Why the two star then?  Well, I was eating this one dessert dish and had a weird feeling about it.  I told my friend, if I'm in the bathroom in less than half an hour, it's because of this dessert.  Well...lo and behold, less than fifteen minutes from leaving that restaurant, I had to find the ladies' room.  Yep, my lunch was making an exit!    Overall, everything else was fine.  Service was standard and the food was okay.  But when one little item gets you running for the toilet, it's never fun.  Blah!  Breakfast (Monday - Saturday): 7am - 10am $6.45  Lunch (Monday - Saturday): 11am - 3pm $7.45  Dinner (Sunday - Thursday): 4pm - 9pm $12.95 Dinner (Friday & Saturday): 4pm - 10pm $12.95  Brunch (Sunday): 8am - 3pm $11.95  Monday Steak Night: 4pm - 9pm $13.95  Wednesday Seafood Night: 4pm - 9pm $16.95  Updated! 07/30/07 - I went here a couple of weeks ago on a Friday night.  They were offering 50% off the buffet with your movie stub, and we had just returned from watching Transformers.  It's seafood night, so the price was about $16.95/pp, but what a steal when you get half off.  The BF was craving some snow crab legs and I noted oysters on the half shell.  We both gorged on those two alone, and maybe with some shrimp, and when we did finally check out what else they offered, it was sad to see that there really wasn't much else.  They were out of spoons, bowls, etc., and it didn't matter where you checked on the buffet line, they just didn't have any!  Even the soft serve machine was breaking down when I was there.  Overall, there's not much going on in this buffet.  Yes, there's a line to be seated, but I think it's because everyone had a coupon of some sort too.  (And can you really complain when your buffet meal is less than $9/pp?)",

The mimosas were decent, though I downed an entire one while waiting at the front of the line, since it seemed to be problematic that we requested a table, not a booth.  Even though there were several empty tables in full view, we were asked twice if we wanted a booth instead.

This buffet doesn't compare those at the Wynn, Belliago, or any of the other high end place but is still good for the price  I remember dining on some really nice prime-rib that was better than the ones I had before at Wynn or Belliago just because it seemed fresher and not as much pre-cooked.  The meat flavor was also something decently good, better than those $7.99 prime rib specials you find downtown or at buffalo bills.   I remember eating a lot of their breakfast usuals like eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage etc.  I saw a lot of people getting made-fresh omeletes but I didn't partake on this as I was filling up on prime-rib and fried shrimp...lol.  I saw the dessert section which looked \"okay\" with things like carrot cake, cheesecake, etc... I didn't have enough room to try them but I'm assuming they were probably average.  Lastly, I thought their fresh-fruit section was really good.  I had pineapple, honeydew, and freshly-cut grapefruit sections!!    Overall for around $13 bucks, the Garden Buffet is a good deal only if you're staying at the South Point Hotel... otherwise it's not really worth the drive out here since it's so far from the main strip hotels.  Here's a tip, I saw a few players getting comps when they were playing $25 or more a hand at blackjack or any other table game.",

The place was overly small, cramped and the services staff was non attentive, rude, and didn't seem to understand that if you want to get my attention to seat me, dont whisper. SPEAK LOUDER. Some of the food was luke warm and some was straight cold and inedible. The place was a mess with possibly the most dirty floor I've ever seen. The \"Salad Bar\" was some store bought chopped up lettuce and some onions thrown out on a little cart like you'd find serving you on a train or a plane. The food was stored away behind this huge wall structure that takes away all the room of the dining area and makes getting food that much more cramped. Very inconvienient. Lastly, they were about to close and the amount of food waste was unbelievable, as they were closing one of the guys pulled out a fresh tray of sausages and put it on the back counter. So much waste and an overall horrible experience.",

    "text": "Let me preface and say that the ONLY reason we ate here was because my boyfriend's family was staying at South Point, and this was the only place that didn't have a long wait. I read the reviews in advance and warned everyone, but bf's aunt has low blood sugar and needed to eat ASAP, so we ended up here.  Wednesday night is \"Luau Night\" at the garden buffet, with Hawaiian favorites as well as all you can drink Mai Tai's! The buffet is priced at $14.95 pp with a players card or $19.95 without. Do yourself a favor and get a damn players card. This buffet is not worth $10, let alone $19.95. Seriously, it takes two minutes. Just go to the rewards center and sign up.  The Mai Tai's were available at the front right when you walked into the dining room. They were absolutely horrible. The only way I can describe the Mai Tai was it tasted like rotten sweet and sour. There was no alcohol in it that I could taste or smell. It was overly sweet and not good. No wonder they were included.  The food was hit or miss. I had some lechon that was pretty good and Hawaiian pizza. The Portuguese soup was another good one. It was hearty and flavorful with chunks of sausage and white beans. I tried the garlic shrimp, and it was so old that it was mushy. There was poke on the salad bar that was turning funny colors, and since food poisoning was not in the cards for the evening, I skipped it. Bummer cause I love poke. They also had mac salad that looked questionable so I skipped that also. I filled up on soup, salad and bread pretty much.   For dessert they had malasadas, and various cakes and cookies. They also had a small gelato bar, and i got to try the strawberry and espresso flavors which were both very good. But to pay $15 for bread, soup and salad I was pretty disappointed.   TLDR; skip this buffet and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Been here a few times over the years ~  Even came for a few holiday buffets they offered. I have to say buffets usually win out over a restaurant because most the time you can find what you want on the buffet if your not sure what your in the mood for plus your drink and dessert is included for one price,  This buffet is ok nothing real special to make you want to keep coming back unless you have a players card discount from joining the players club in the casino.  The seafood night is usually our favorite with auce crab legs, The restaurant is clean and well maintained every time we have been here. Service is not too bad, of course always depending on who you get anywhere you go.  If your staying at South Point and limited to transportation this is  not a bad place to eat,, Just not a upper class place like Bellagio or one of the higher end casinos buffets,  I usually like to go to a buffet as early as possible and when it is a bit busier since the food changes out pretty fast,",

The waitress was extremely nice and made sure my table was cleared. Food is good especially for the price. Its easy to find what kind of food you want ,every section is labeled. Although the asian section i was really feeling, dessert made up for it. I went during lunch and it was busy. It was a welcome change from the chinese buffets i usually frequent",

Today when we were getting ready to pay for lunch the lady behind the counter told us that they are shutting down in 30 minutes to set up for dinner which means that we would only have 30 minutes to get the only food we could have. Not only this, but that after the new food was served we weren't allowed to get up to get anything else unless we went out and paid AGAIN for dinner. We offered to pay the dinner price instead(which was $1 cheaper for each plate) which they said we couldn't do. So basically they said that we could get either pay $17 for 30 minutes of cold food, which defeated the purpose of a buffet or we could wait an hour and 15 min and be very hungry and irritated for nonsense. So we left to IHOP. Never coming back here again.",

It deserves the low stars because it is such lower quality than what the trend in buffets in vegas is becoming. If you are looking for a good buffet, wiling to not be cheap, and by south point, just keep driving to the M and enjoy Studio B. Ye can thank me later.   In regards to the Garden Buffet: It's not completely miserable. If you are on a budget, it could be an option for a large quantity of food for cheap. You can go register for a club card and get an even better price for your entire party (we saved $15 for 30 seconds of work).  There are some things at the Buffet that you will certainly like. A personal favorite of mine is having the live custom stir fry esque experience. I could eat plates of fresh cooked garlic beef with water chestnuts for the whole meal and be satisfied.   Do yourself a favor if you're in vegas and actually interested in a good buffet to go to Cesars, Cosmo, M, or any other myriad of buffets I love. The joint at the South Point is jut south of par.",

It was the saddest buffet I've ever seen. I didn't go back for a second plate and neither would my boyfriend or my child. I stuck with the safest option of salad and prime rib and my prime rib was the fattiest one I've ever had. The salad was fine but I don't know how you could mess up plain veggies. The deserts were scarce and my cheesecake tasted like it came from a box, ended up taking one bite. The service was fine and our waiter was nice, but let's be real, when you go to a buffet it's definitely about the food. I can't believe anyone pays to eat there or that the buffet is even open. Seemed like a sad cafeteria :/.  Save yourself the nonsense of eating at this buffet and head down to the M casino. Much better quality, variety,atmosphere, same pricing and alcohol is included unlike the sad garden buffet.",

Most did not seem to eat their prime rib because it seemed too rare, by the time I decided to try it, it was way over cooked and dry! The omelet was the only thing that was ok because it was made in front of you. Definitely not worth $20 PP, I would be reluctant to pay $10 PP.

The food wasn't horrible, but there isn't a huge selection, but again it's decent. They had some interesting food choices, which was different for myself, but good cause now I know what it is and what it tastes like. The drink server though wasn't very attentive, she barely came around asking for refills on my coffee and my girlfriend's iced tea...she was fast to get the dishes, but it's hot now and we thirsty. I used to work as a buffet manager and I can definitely tell a lot of the hosts and servers didn't want to be there, let alone the chefs keeping the food up when things were running low. Of course, this was my first time, maybe another chance is needed?",

Plus, they give you a coupon for 50% off the buffet when you check-in, S C O R E. Just make sure you save that one for the Seafood Buffet night on Fridays, 25 bucks (Reg. Price) for all you can eat oyster, crab legs, shrimp and everything else.   There aren't as many options as let's say, the Rio LV Buffet.. but their omelette station in the morning is great! They even can use egg whites if you ask them to.  For Lunch you can make Stir-fry which is great too.  For dinner, a favorite for me is their prime rib. It's so juicy and flavorful.  Plus, please save room for a slice of their German Choc. Cake.. its the bomb.   PLUS = all drinks (non-alcoholic) are INCLUDED. Get a pepsi now and coffee after. I loved that.   Downside was that some of the other choices were just meh.  Pizza, meh. Pasta, meh. Ice cream, yuck (perhaps made with water).  & beef barley soup or split pea soup as their only soup options..why!? Change it up, put some chicken noodle soup in there.   Overall, it's not a bad deal! Just try a little of everything, I'm sure you'll find something you'll like.",

I was pleased to see they offered decent size Shrimp on the buffet.   I recommend you getting a player's card, it's free to sign up and we saved $4 a person for having it during lunch.  They allow 2 people per player's card for the discount.  The buffet had American, Chinese, Italian and Japanese food. Great variety of food and not bad tasting either.  The buffet includes a beverage for the price.  Service was great!  I would definitely return in the future and recommend this buffet to others.",

And the gelato station was open!!! The Asian food was tasty. The rest of the food was ok. Too much cheese in the omelet (about an inch high!), and the sausage patty was tough!!

Seemed to be a decent buffet for the most part but not having tried others especially in Vegas, it is hard for me to rate.  I would give it a 3 star but you have to be selective in what you choose.  The basics are good eg prime rib, spinach, rice pilaf, mashed potatoes.  For the club price, thought it was very reasonable especially compared to other alternatives we have up in Canada.  I'd read others reviews for comparisons to other Vegas buffets as they seem to have a better appreciation for what else is available. But it seems to me that no lineups and reasonable food to satisfy both adults and kids at a decent price wins them a 3.",

I went back to see if I could find something more appetizing, but couldn't so I just made myself a salad. The server came around maybe once. Bleh.  So despite telling myself \"never again\" I found myself at South Point because my friends and I were in town for a convention in their convention center. My friend needed to be somewhere at 2pm and it was already 1:40pm so we picked the buffet since it had no line and we figured he could overload one plate and eat really fast while the rest of us took our time. Also we had 50% off coupons.   It was Saturday brunch and we figured even South Point couldn't mess up breakfast food. Turns out we were right. The breakfast items were great. The problem was this was a brunch and they were charging brunch prices. This would double the price of breakfast and significantly more than the regular lunch price. Basically each station had breakfast items (sausage, bacon, potatoes, eggs, etc.) that were identical or with only minor differences. There were very few lunch items even though brunch lasted until 3pm. Of what they did offer, the Asian station had delicious ribs that looked to be the only Asian item at that station (everything else was sausage, potatoes, eggs, etc.). The Italian station also had a few good items. The food has certainly improved since my last experience and I wouldn't mind eating there again, although I probably wouldn't eat brunch in the afternoon again given the higher cost and lack of non-breakfast items. I can't drink enough mimosas to justify the higher price.  The good news was that the service was much improved. Our server was attentive and had a charming personality.",

    "text": "1.5 Stars.  ---   This place keeps going downhill. Save your time & money and go eat at Silvertons. Met up with some SoCal friends that had free rooms here so we decided to have the buffet. It so happened to be steak night. The steaks are horrible. Well done steaks are medium, medium steaks are super rare & I didn't even try the bleeding carcass below \"medium\". The vibram soles on my work boots would have been more tender. I had to carve up 8 steaks to get 3 forkfuls that were half palatable & not rubbery or gritty.. The food in general was warm to room temperature a half hr after dinner service started and probably not up to health code regs. The Mexican & Italian sections were sub par, food just tasted strange, weird spicing choices. The chile rellanos, besides tasting freezer burned had almost a chemical taste. The cod was dry but the breading was oily. The deserts were anemic & tasteless & I don't want to know what the goo was coming out of the ice cream machine. Our beverage fetcher would disappear for 20 minutes at a time. Way to expensive, was around $17 a head.  The only plus, the little Mongolian grilling station is decent. Only thing to eat there.",

    "text": "Garden Buffet at South Point, has its ups and downs. It is very spacious and roomy, where its easy to get to and from the buffet line. It does have nice furniture and a nice staff. But of course, we didn't come here for the room itself.   They do have a good selection of food, even a good selection of seafood. Usually a place that serve sushi at buffet is always a plus for me. But I guess the time that we went, wasn't very pleasant. I guess with the fact, that we went was probably late lunch, we didn't know that there was a time set for lunch and dinner. So we basically got the left overs of lunch in other words. Mainly food that's been sitting out there for a few hours, rice that hasn't been changed and over cooked. Sushi tend to be dry and hard, as well as some seafood. Luckily we didn't get sick, but it was kind of nasty that some of the food on our plate was as hard as a rock. But again, we did go during the end of lunch hour.   I'm probably sure, if we did go earlier for lunch, it may have been different. But the fact that it has time limits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I guess they don't circulate food as much, and probably stop at a certain hour so they can start with the dinner buffet.   Now, if you have no where else to go, to eat. Then I would probably suggest to get there early, and not during the end of the lunch hours, if you want to experience a decent meal. Otherwise, I would probably suggest another place to eat.",

    "text": "For dinner, we decided to try out the South Point's Garden Buffet.  It was a huge huge huge mistake.    The wait was not that bad to get in.  We only waited in line for less than 10 minutes and were seated a few minutes later.  Service -- adequate for a buffet.  Food -- one word --- ahh, \"yuck\"!  There is really nothing special with the South Point buffet.  Honestly, the food was not very fresh and the quality was way below standard.  For example, it is now oyster season (month's with the letter \"R\" in it - October).  I walked over to the oyster station and the smell of \"rotten\" oysters was absolutely disgusting.  These oysters must have sat here ALL day.  And, yet, no one replaced them or bothered to clean the stations.  As for other meats, the chicken was dry.  And, the prime rib was not very good.  Only thing that I enjoyed was the pasta and some of the desserts.  We were extremely disappointed with this place.  This is probably one of the places that we have to cross out on places to eat.  I definitely would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "With all the buffets in Vegas, the Garden Buffet is definitely on the lower end. My parents and I came here because my dad had a comp for two and we paid for one. It was seafood night, so I agreed to go. It was a huge disappointment, even though we only paid for one and got a free bottle of wine.  Their crab legs are dry, the raw oysters looked like a health hazard, and the line for the seafood section does not justify what you get. The same crab legs and oysters from the salad bar, with fried shrimp, eel, and clams.   Everyone says do not fill up on salad at buffets, but that was the best looking area. The prime rib was dry and tough and the salmon had a coating of sauce that had the consistency of glue.  I was impressed with the Chinese section though, not because of the food selection, but with the dedication of the employees when it came to changing out food. The fried fish in tomato sauce was delicious, because they changed it out often to prevent the batter coated fish from being too mushy.  I would suggest paying a few dollars more and go to the M buffet instead. Now that is a beautiful off strip buffet.",

    "text": "For the price, this buffet is GREAT!  I was really surprised when I entered the $13.95 Saturday brunch buffet to see PRIME RIB out.  Since there's a \"prime rib night\" at the buffet I figured it was a rarity, but apparently it isn't.  It was also available at dinner on Saturday night for their $14.95 buffet!!!  Okay, now that that's out of the way.... There are definitely some questionable items (eggs benedict with dried up hollandaise sauce... must've been sitting there for quite some time, ew), but overall there's enough variety and decent enough quality to please most peoples' palates (assuming they aren't too stuck up).  Some highlights: -corned beef hash for brunch... mmm. -crispy but not overdone waffles (at brunch AND dinner--with fried chicken at dinner haha). -cooked to order omelettes (huge, btw). -MY favorite form of frozen yogurt out of a machine--icy, NOT creamy. -pork tamales. -prime rib! -carved turkey with ALL the fixings--stuffing, mashed potatoes, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce.  I love turkey!  Also, they have a mongolian BBQ thing going on, but the BF and I decided not to try it... whoops.  He said it didn't seem to come with noodles, but that would just be plain wrong!  I'll have to look at other reviews to see what the truth is...",

For $12.99 for a dinner buffet you would believe that at least something decent would be put out. About the only reason I give the place two stars is that the service is decent. For food I would give it zero stars if that were possible - and I'm not that hard to please.",

I went about 2:30 but they didn't tell us they close at 3pm to start getting ready for dinner.  Choices were limited and they were very resistant to putting new food out, since they were going to be closed for an hour.  I thought it was strange they still had breakfast food out at 2:30 in the afternoon, but who I am to judge when people wake up.  I liked the mongolian grill part, but they don't add noodles to your dish, and they had no pork.  My friends said the mushrooms didn't taste like they had been washed and the sushi was so hard you could chip a tooth on it.  Dessert was odd, I think I may have grabbed a display cake because my fork would not penetrated it on any side.  I had to go back and asked for one in the cooler.  I would eat here again if I was in the area, but the South Point has better choices, however; it's only like 15 bucks.",
