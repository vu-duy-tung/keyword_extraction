It was the perfect size for my girlfriend and I to try a selection of fresh fish. The fish was thick cut, no sauce, no rice, and perfect condition. We got a few more items to check out the menu and everything was good. The service was a good, but not great. There was nothing wrong, it was just a little lackluster.  Overall a great dining experience. Perfect for date night!",

    "text": "If you're looking for a truly amazing dining experience, I'm talking awesome service and great quality fish, this is the place!! You won't find any of that C-grade vana Uni crap here, not like you do at AYCE spots.   My mother and I each had the touch and go meal set. It consisted of a half of a special roll, your choice, miso soup, salad, steamed rice, tsukemono, and two protein choices. I had the teriyaki chicken and the teriyaki salmon. Both the chicken and the salmon were cooked to perfection. The teriyaki sauce was great, not super heavy and not too sweet nor too salty.   My husband indulged in the 10 course meal. Everything looked and tasted amazing. He had a small salmon bowl, salmon carpaccio, agedashi tofu, salmon teriyaki, rice, salad, red bean ice cream, corn and egg soup, half a speciality roll, edamame and maybe one more item that I can't recall. Each item was great. The portions of salmon were all generous ones. The flavors were great and as mentioned above, everything was so fresh. The salmon melted in your mouth like butter.   My kid brother had the salmon overflow bowl. The picture on the menu, that's exactly what it looks like when it comes from the chef. There is no skimping at all. The rice underneath is tender and pre seasoned. Yum!! The salmon is top quality and the chef will continue to give you great cuts, especially fatty and so silky, until you tell the waiters that you're all tapped out. Man!! I'm telling you, this place is just awesome and so delicious. If you truly appreciate great sushi and sashimi, this spot is a must!!   Kinda funny, the waiter heard avocado instead of Masago so at one point, an order of avocado nigiri was brought to our table. Oops. LOL. We mentioned it to the waiter and we all shared a good laugh. The nice thing, although he misheard that portion of the order, he didn't question our selection when it was initially made. An once we brought up the tiny mistake, he quickly went to correct it without any problems. And generously, he let us keep our avocado nigiri. LOL! When the Masago came out, it was not only beautiful in presentation but it was also such a beautiful fresh bright orange color. Delicious!!   The wait staff works as a team. It was nice to not always have to go to our usual waiter to ask for things. All the waiters were willing to help us, no matter if it was adding another order of sushi, a drink request, or something simple like an extra plate or replacement pair of hashi. Water was always being refilled without request or reminder. Plates were constantly being removed from our table as well, to make room for entrees, rolls, on the house additions, etc.   The chef really appreciated our business and our feedback. He gave us each our own bowl of his special salmon soup, on the house. The soup broth was phenomenal and there were big hunks of salmon in each of our bowls. After paying our bill, the chef also gave us some of his special cereal like dessert that he makes himself, in house. I am told it's like Capt crunch cereal but in strawberry and green tea flavors. I've never had Capt crunch before but this stuff was magnificent, especially in its creamy seeming flavor. I'd easily come back here during my next trip to Vegas!!!!   Another nice thing, I was able to make a reservation through Yelp which, I believe, redirected me to the seat me site. But anyway, making the reservation was easy! Everything went smoothly and we shared an amazing meal.",

They come with all kinds of appetizers, entrees, and dessert. They have oyster, edamame, carpaccio, and salad for appetizer. They have teriyaki, tempura, sukiyaki, nigiri sushi, a sushi roll of your choice, etc. for the entree. Once you decide to order the 10+ course dinner, the waiter will give you a paper and pencil to check off the items you would like to order for each course.  The deal is pretty good, but the food quality is only ok. The service was really slow. They only have 2 waiters to serve the whole restaurant, and sometimes they got frustrated and forgot something. The dessert came first and they forgot my soup. The dinner service itself took a while for 3 hours. While the 10+ course is a good deal, it might not be very suitable for this restaurant, since they only have 2 waiters. 10+ course with one dish at a time requires a lot of man power and legwork.  Ample parking in free parking lot inside plaza.",

Great sushi for a fair price, my wife proclaimed it was the best she's ever had. Very interesting menu, like sushi for the american (and specifically Vegas) crowd with lots of added tastes and textures to make things special. Was way better than eating on the strip. We went early, 5pm so we could catch a 7pm show and it was no problem. Lots of other people where there doing the same thing.",

After reading all the positive reviews, I figured this would be a great place to bring my family who was visiting for the holidays. Although most of the food was good, unfortunately the service was horrible. The female server gave us attitude for not having a reservation when we got there. Granted we were a party of 8 but it didn't take too long for them to seat us. She was abrupt and rude, kept leaving while taking our order to seat other diners and barely checked on us throughout dinner. The only saving grace was the male server who was definitely a LOT nicer and more helpful. The worst part was gratuity was automatic because of the party size which would have been fine except she didn't deserve it. In the end, I felt bad for recommending this place to my family. Such a shame since this reflects poorly on Chef Takashi's reputation.",

    "text": "Tried this place out on a Tuesday night around 8pm because of the high Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint! I definitely recommend making reservations if you're going around 7-9pm and want to sit in their cozy booths that make you feel like you're inside a wooden barrel. They had a variety of choices on the menu to choose from. From sashimi, nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked items. You can either do a la carte or pick from a 10 course dinner [$29.99] or 12 course dinner [$39.99] . As well as ayce for $80 which is steep or they had some other cheaper sets as well. The boyfriend and I chose to both do the 12 course. They bring out a piece of paper and for each course you get to choose which item you want from their list. I chose garlic edamame, hamachi w/jalapeno, agedashi tofu, oysters [4 on the halfshell], soba salad with salmon skin [there were soba noodles in it! Pretty interesting], salmon bowl, tempura mix [shrimp and veggies], salmon teriyaki, sukiyaki [noodles, sliced beef, tofu, veggies in hot sweet broth], blue diamond roll, miso soup, and to finish off I had condensed milk shaved ice. I'd definitely recommend this place for someone who's looking for something different. Only thing I'd change is the wait time on food.. After half way through we both got over waiting for another item to come but I see why they do that so you have time to enjoy your current dish. Everything was good and we definitely had stuff leftover to take home!",

What's great other than the food being awesome is that you have options.  With each course there are at least two choices.  The plating of each course definitely matched the excellence of the flavor for each dish as well.  Since I had put a note in the reservation that it was my wife's birthday they also sent out a complementary dessert which tasted as great as it looked.  We will definitely be back and have already spread the word to several friends.  From the food to the timely and friendly service this place is a must for visitors and locals alike.",

My husband had the 10 course meal and I had two rolls knowing I would never be able to eat all that. The 10 courses were more like 10 tapas plates, but still a wonderful way to have a meal.  I really would go four and a half stars, but the fried squid was slightly over salty and the corn soup and tempura needed salt, but other than that everything was truly great and we would definitely go back again.  As we were leaving the sushi chef saw us,  ran out the back door near where he was working, and said goodbye to us and thanked us for coming. Very nice touch!  A GEM!!",

    "text": "Came here with my sister and my mom for my mom's birthday, and we had a pleasant experience. I definitely knew I wanted to try their set course dinner, but my family has a small appetite. We ended up getting a 10 course and a 12 course to share. We were served by two people during a dinner, a male and female (I wish I got the guy's name because he was great!). Our waiter let us know that because the courses are usually for one person, we would have to order something off the menu in order to let us share. I didn't mind this.   Here's what we tried: 1) Garlic and Original Edamame: Definitely get the garlic edamame. 2) Salmon and Tuna Carpaccio: I think these two plates were some of my favorites of the course. At the end of the course, even though my stomach was about to explode, I wanted more of this.  3) Soba and Tofu Salad: My mom ate most of both of these by herself because she enjoyed the dressing. Her small appetite was such lie! 4) Beef and Salmon Teriyaki: This was given to us towards the end of our course, and I was so scared for the portion size because I was getting full. However, I thought the size was just perfect. It was a little bit on the overcooked side though. 5) Blue Diamond Roll, Forgot Name?, and Baked Fantasy: All of these were recommended by our waiter, and we loved them. When he recommended \"forgot name\", we were like uhhhh how could you forget the name of one your favorite rolls??! But that's actually what it was called and got a good laugh out of it. Baked Fantasy melted in our mouths. 6) Oysters: I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but I chose this for my mom since it's her birthday (gotta treat her like what she actually is...a queen). After being disappointed by the quality of oysters in Vegas, she was amazed by how great it was here. 7) Tempura and Karaage: Didn't care much for them...I thought the fried batter on the tempura was too thick and the karaage was dry. 8) Sukiyaki: Expected from a sushi place, the interior was cold. Having this made us feel better and the beef is reaaallllyyy good in this. Also came with noodles. 9) Grilled Asparagus and Agedashi Tofu: I loved the grilled asparagus so much that I pretty much had to fight my family for it. Agedashi Tofu was okay to me. Maybe because I prefer the tofu to not be fried?  10) Salmon Bowl: My family and I are salmon lovers so choosing this was a no-brainer. No regrets about this. The salmon was fresh and the texture of it was really silky..can't think of a better term. Try it! 11) Miso Soup: Naturally chose this option since none of us are fans of creamy soups. I thought it was more on the bland side, but I drank this while eating the fried food (tempura and karaage), so I made it work but balancing out fried and bland?? Does this logic even actually make sense.. 12) Coffee Jelly w/ Ice Cream and Strawberry Ice Cream: It was a bit too sweet for my preference, but I was still able to enjoy it.  TL;DR Fresh seafood. Huge variety and combinations that there's bound to be something that works for you. Make sure you have an appetite if you opt for the course dinners..and loose pants. Service was really good at first, but it went downhill for us at the end of our meal. A huge party entered, and the entire staff was waiting for them so I guess they forgot about us. However, I will no doubt be back again!!",

Not to mention, we had ordered a 10 course meal (split between two people each) for about $20-$30.  We barely even finished it, but powered through because everything was so delicious!

To top it off, the service was great and everyone was very friendly--particularly Sean, our server. He gave great recommendations and was very attentive.  1. Salmon and Kanpachi Sashimi (great amberjack): both were not fishy at all and very fresh. We also added sushi rice on the side.  2. Cold Soba: Delicious with a good texture  3. Shrimp Tempura: Tasted good, but I would say this was the least impressive dish. They were on the small side.  4. Chawan- Mushi: AMAZING. One of the best steamed eggs I have had. This does take about 15-20 minutes to make.  5. Matcha Panna Cotta: My mom ordered this and she said  \"This is the best Japanese dessert I have had in the US\"  The entire meal came out to just under $55 for two people including tip!!! I will definitely be back if we are back in Vegas. I rarely ever write reviews, but after spending hundreds each night in Vegas, this was exactly what we needed--an amazing meal at a good price.",

    "text": "This Sushi restaurant is very good. We were turned away by another Sushi restaurant that is highly rated, and very pricey, because we did not have a reservation, so we walked a few blocks, and decided on this one. I have a hard time believing the other place had sushi that was that much better... They have many sushi options; rolls, specialty rolls, boats... We chose a few rolls. The Grand Canyon Roll was our favorite hands down it has so much in it and the flavors all go together so well. But, our other rolls were also good and the fish tasted very fresh. They have pages and pages of Saki, if you want Saki. They also have 4 Japanese Whiskeys. I have never had a salad, at a Japanese restaurant, as big or as full of ingredients, as their salad. It was very good, and you have a choice or salad dressings. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. Service was great.",

Beef Tataki was not like I expected. I didn't really like it. The beef didn't seem seared and the beef was a bit too cold for my taste. The sauce was good though! Chicken Karaage WAS THE BEST THING EVER! The chicken was very juicy and tender!! Droollll! I need more! There is a ginger kick to it. IT WAS VERY VERY VERY good! Should've gotten the 12 piece! Salmon Lover was good as well! A lot of Salmon, there was regular Salmon and Salmon Belly! IT WAS DELICIOUS!  Environment The restaurant is on a plaza. The inside is really nice. There is the sushi bar on the right and the left side had booth seating. The place is rather dark.... definitely good for a date, which I didn't have... :( Everything was all fancy, just expected of any japanese restaurant these days  Niceness of Staff Once we walked in it was a bit annoying because no one said anything. Stood there for about 3 minutes before someone decided to seat me. The only bad part was getting them to seat me, otherwise they were great. Placed my order and got my food and it was all good.  Dollar $$ All good Sashimi comes at a price. Definitely good sushi (compared to Orlando FL any sashimi is good honestly....)   Yes? Yes yes yes! The chicken was the best! and the salmon was great! The beef tataki I would not get again, other that that everything was great! Not sure if I would explore anything else... the Chicken and Salmon for my stomach!  #WendyTakesVegas #WendyWanders",

I live in LA and if this place was in business there it would be out of business in 1 night. Very tacky and fish quality was very poor. I did have a very nice waiter but not to a tentative and was more important about who is coming in even though it was at 11 p.m. at night.

I got the bottomless dinner. By bottomless, it means unlimited refill of salad, rice, and miso soup. This is complemented by carpaccio, hot meat dish (teriyaki, beef, salmon, etc), half roll of my choice, shrimp tempura, miso soup, salad and ice cream! All this for only $22!  First the quality of the food. The rolls were really hit or miss. I don't remember the names but my wife got the two rolls combination and ordered rolls with yellow tail and salmon on salmon. They were drenched with ponzu sauce. OTOH, I had a half spider roll and it was great.   The other nuances was the food came in the wrong order and we had to keep asking for certain items as they failed to bring them out. I would expect my salad, soup, and appetizer to come first. Instead, I got my rolls first, then my spicy yakiniku, shrimp tempura and rolls. I had to ask to get my soup. I later realized I never got my salad. My wife didn't get her soup or edamame and we had to remind them on separate occasions. It was a bit frustrating. Simple things that ruined the dining experience a bit.",

I know they did their best to accommodate me with my no nuts, soy proteins or soybean oil.  It's almost impossible at a sushi restaurant.    I personally had the 12-courses.  I gave my soy dishes to my friends who wanted it.  There were so much food.  Everything was delicious to what I could eat.  Server was professional and helpful.

We have been yearning to go back there to have proper Japanese dishes.  Then, here it was.  We got here on our road trip from Washington DC and it was such a delight to us  All the dishes were perfect.  During our short stay in Las Vegas, we visited the place three times and were impressed each time.  We are thankful that Takashi gives us opportunities to have such a fine dining experience.  The prices are also amazing -- very very reasonable, affordable.  A must to go in Las Vegas.",

Overall a mediocre experience and not one I'd repeat or recommend for anyone else. We were really excited to go here too because of the many good reviews. Pass.",

My favorite seats are always at the sushi bar and I think that's what made this place so awesome! Not only was the quality of fish delicious but the service was amazing!

The food alone is worth the visit, but the atmosphere is so laid back and welcoming it makes for quite the dining experience. Our waiter was very patient as we scoured the menu, pointing out favorites we might like and instructing us how to fill out the card for the courses we ordered. My oldest went for the curry chicken and loved it. I ordered the 10 course meal and what a feast it was! The standouts were the scallop carpaccio, the salmon bowl, and the soba salad. I ordered the blue diamond roll as part of the 10 courses and it was plentiful, fresh and delicious. The carpaccio was made from the sweetest scallops paired with thinly sliced lemon, masago and a mild ponzu sauce. It was heavenly. The salmon bowl contained thick salmon slices on top of rice. The salmon was not stringy or tough like one might expect of such a plentiful portion. The taste was fresh and sweet, and the next time I visit I may just go for the refillable salmon bowl. The soba salad has a creamy yet light dressing and noodles with the texture of fresh made pasta. The sushi chef was very friendly and it was quite evident he was very passionate about his sushi. The service couldn't have been better, our drinks never went empty. I would recommend reservations as the place is small and often packed, yet is so worth the wait. I will definitely be back soon.",

Let me tell you that this place will not let you down! Our waiter was so friendly and helpful! We were asking about a roll we really like back at home with deep fried garlic chips, but they did not have any like that there. We were completely and overly happy with everything we did get. The presentation was beautiful and the flavor and freshness of the fish was amazing. We were taking care of our bill when we were surprised by the chef who decided to create a roll just for us! It had our fried garlic chips on a seaweed \"chip\" with a slice of tuna belly. The flavor was nothing less then fantastic! We spoke with him and thanked him for his creativity and thoughtfulness! So if you are ever in Vegas, please, please make the best choice and visit this gem!",

    "text": "I didn't partake of the 10- or 12-course meal of insanity, but there's really no way around it: no matter what you get here, you WILL eat a monstrous amount of food. I appreciate that they offer several specials as well as typical a la carte options, and the menu itself is extensive, with several apps, a giant page of rolls, and everything in between.  CHICKEN KARAGE: So crispy, so juicy! I love Japanese fried chicken, and the version put out here is done just right. SALMON SKIN SALAD: Holy giant portions, Batman! This salad alone could easily be a lunch, packed with fish (not just skin), fruit, and an ample amount of fresh veggies in a light, flavorful dressing. Nice variety of textures, too. 3 ROLL COMBO: This option allows you to pick three special rolls, and get bottomless miso soup, house salad, and dessert (various ice creams) for a crazy-low $26, which is easily enough food for two people but at a cost that rivals the AYCE pricing elsewhere. The miso was standard but the house salad was the first I've come across in an Asian restaurant that included avocado! Add some of the chicken from your karage app and this could easily be a \"safe\" meal for a kid or picky eater. Opted for the Nagasaki (great cilantro sauce!), the Orange Lemon (citrus + seafood = love), and the Sapporo (just enough spice) and found them all unique and tasty, with fresh fish, minimal rice, and tasty (but not overpowering) sauces.   The food was so tasty that we kept ordering and my stomach staged a revolt after the onslaught of food. But in a good way. Pricing is very fair: even a sashimi appetizer plate for two (~10 pieces) is an extremely reasonable $15. I'll definitely be coming back- in addition to the amazing food, the service is on point (ask for Jeffrey!), and the interior is a fun mix of classy and rustic.   NOTE: You can buy a $12 shirt and get 10% off on future visits when you wear it! I haven't done that yet, but if we come back often enough, I might just have to.",

Me and a buddy came here after hearing about their happy hour deal through Vegas eater. And we weren't disappointed!  We arrived pretty late (about 1.5 hours before their closing time) and after reviewing both their regular and happy hour menus, ordered: Chicken karage (HH) Half order scallop yum yum(HH) Half order spicy tuna (HH) 4 piece nigiri 1 piece of the Italian nigiri Touch and go dinner (comes w/1 half order special roll) (..We got the teriyaki salmon & spicy yakiniku, and tempura LoouooLL)  ..to make this as short and straight to the point as possible, every piece of fish was perfectly portion sized cut (generous sized) and most of all very fresh. To match our meal, the owner, was equally as generous. We had made a mistake ordering only 1 Italian nigiri and upon placing a second order, he gave it to us for free. And then he gave us an extra piece of nigiri with our 4 piece order, and made all our half order rolls, full orders. Wow talk about service!  The staff was also all very nice and attentive to us as well, I don't think I ever seen my glass only half full (after coming to takashi I'm now an optimist). The servers always made sure our drinks were completely filled and we had everything we needed.  The salmon teriyaki and our chicken karage was very moist! This was something that actually really took me by surprise since I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't over cook these 2 items dry. The yakiniku was really good and interesting, sort of reminded us both of pizza.. And the Italian nigiri was a smooth and tasteful blend of what I think was pesto and Ikira on top of the lightly seared fish and had a very pleasant and juicy flavor... Overall based on my reactions after our first time to sushi takashi?.. A well deserved 5 stars!",

    "text": "Sushi Takashi is located in the former short lived Hiromaru ramen joint. But, they have changed the interior completely, with dark sexy colors and wood, cool booths, and a wide sushi bar. After taking a seat at the bar, I met the man himself, Chef Takashi, who is a friendly and cool person. While they do have an a la carte menu, I was more interested in the shiny, laminated menu that had some more unique options. On one side contained a 10 course and 12 course menu. And on the other side, a combo menu with a whole lot of options including a bottomless one, a roll one, a never ending salmon bowl, and a quick to-go bento. They also have an $80 ayce option. I decided to go with the 12 course.  This was interesting because it wasn't like a traditional kaiseki, where the portions are super small. The value at Takashi's is better than most of the izakayas in the valley. And what else is interesting is that you modify the options on the course menu as you see fit.  Before the courses began, they brought out some mini Japanese crackers to snack on. They were good.  The first course was the the garlic edamame. The spices were really good and bright. And the edamame had a vibrant color.  The next course was the tuna carpaccio. The fish quality was excellent and it went well with soy dressing that had yuzu in it.  Next came the salad. I think that I made a great combo with the soba noodle and salmon skin options. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the salmon skin had a great texture to them. I enjoyed the tanginess of the mayo dressing that they used to bring everything together.  The meat dish came out next. I ordered the beef teriyaki. This was a simplified version of grilled beef that was seasoned lightly. The beef was of very good quality, and was cooked to a spot-on medium rare. The sauce was kept on the light side, and helped amplify the taste of the beef, rather than mask it as some other spots tend to do.  The chef also gave me a taste of the king crab that was available. You don't normally see this item in most sushi restaurants, and I appreciated that fact.  The next course was the roll course, in which you can choose from the menu any one of specialty rolls on the menu. I chose the King club roll, which is their king crab made into a roll with avocado. What I noticed immediately was that their rice is cooked perfectly, not too hard or soft, and I personally don't like a too strong of a vinegar taste, and I liked that Takashi's was more neutral-sweet, because that gives it more of a natural taste to the rice. Seriously, king crab and avocado? Now that's what i'm talking about!  Next course was the chicken, and I chose the karage. I liked the fact that the chicken were PIPING HOT!! A lot of sushi restaurants in Vegas can learn a thing or two from Takashi about making their karage more hot.  Next the seafood course came, and I picked the oysters. Six large oysters were brought out in this Asian mignonette style sauce. They were fresh and sweet. I literally could have eaten about 50 of these. They were amazing.   Next, the sukiyaki came out. It came with a generous amount of beef, and it was fun eating it with the noodles, onions, and scallions.   The baked dish was next so what looked like a dynamite baked roll came out and was very tasty as well.  My nigiri dish came out afterwards and I can say that I am impressed with the high quality of the fish they are using here. It's higher than Goyemon's and more like Yummy Grill's on Lake Mead (Not Eastern ave!!). The rice was perfect and everything just went really well together.  The soup course then came. I ordered the creamy white stew. Looking back, I would have probably chosen the miso. I liked the earthiness of the stew, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.  Chef Takashi wanted me to try their tuna belly before my last course as a gesture of their grand opening. Once again, they are using high quality fish, and they are thick slices. Mikey likes it!  My last course came out which was the dessert course. I ordered the tempura ice cream. The ice cream was exquisite, and the batter was very neutral tasting, which highlighted the ice cream.  Throughout the evening, what I realized was that I never felt rushed throughout the evening. The service was awesome, even though it's a brand new restaurant. It has actually been a really long time since I've felt just really comfortable eating at a sushi restaurant. My impression was that I was eating at a Strip high-end sushi restaurant, without having to pay those overpriced, exorbitant prices that those restaurants on the Strip usually command. Even though they have just opened, if they are able to maintain the quality, this would be one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Great value, great quality, great service, great ambiance, that's all you can really ask for. I'm kinda over the AYCE thing, so i'm looking for a bit more, and Sushi Takashi delivers!",

    "text": "The very first thing to say about Sushi Takashi is that the food is very, very good.  The food is as good as any sushi restaurant on the strip, except you don't have to go to a hotel and pay the expensive price!  Sushi Takashi offers a variety of Japanese food, not only sushi.  There are a wide range of desserts (shaved ice and tempura ice cream) as well as other Japanese cuisine, like sukiyaki and curry.  There is an All-You-Can Eat option for around seventy dollars, but the course options are of variegated choices while still very filling.  I tried the ten-course sushi dinner, and it was more than enough food.    My particular favourite was the scallop carpaccio.  It was topped with masago, a tangy sauce, a very thin lemon slice, and garnished with a small bit of cilantro.  The tangy lemon and sauce blended very nicely with the rich, buttery scallop.  The quality and variety of food is great, but I think the food could be served in a more timely fashion--I want plenty of time to wolf it down!  Overall, I felt that the restaurant gave me the upper hand--I could enjoy high-quality sushi and Japanese food without going to the strip.  It was also an interesting, different option than the traditional All-You-Can Eat (plus there's no time limit!)",

Unfortunately, the second time we went was a little disappointing because they weren't presenting the courses the same way.  For example, our oysters came in a boat the first time, on a small white plate the second time. And our Sukiyaki came in a big old style pot while the second time it was a smaller and less stylistic pot.  That being said, the value is still there and if you go for one of the smaller options, you can still get a ton of value here. But value isn't everything and the food could still be better.",

    "text": "I often search \"hot and new\" when I'm not particularly in the mood for something specific. I enjoy being the Guinea pig for a new restaurant in town!  ...aaaand this is how I ended up at Sushi Takashi for a solo dinner tonight!    I arrived at about 8:30, and the restaurant was pretty empty. Kawika was my server and took care of me from start to finish.  He filled my water, took my order, brought out all of my food, and took my dirty dishes.  He was very attentive and although it was slow, seemed to have that sense of urgency I appreciate in a full service restaurant.   I ordered the $15.95 combo plate with 2 orders of teriyaki chicken and a half order of the Hakodate signature roll (yellowtail, ponzu, jalapeno). To drink, I just had water.   Food came out quick and was plated beautifully. I started with the salad which was definitely overdressed, but still delicious. I'll ask for light dressing next time. The chicken was thin cut (love it when Japanese restaurants do this!) and the sauce was watery, but it didn't seem to take away from the flavor. Maybe it's just a house-made teriyaki sauce?!  Either way, no complaints.  The roll was delicious. I love when sushi rolls have slices of jalapeno on top that are effective enough to taste + have a little bit of the seeds still attached. I hate those itty bitty small jalapeno slices that some sushi places put on top. Where do they even get jalapenos that small?!  Lol.   Miso soup came with the meal and was ok.  I literally ate everything off of the plate, including the ginger. Lol. I was satisfied, but was craving something sweet...so I opted for the fried Oreos ($4.95).  How do you mess up fried Oreos?!  I mean, really you can't!  Yum. Yum. Yum.   My check was $22, great value for what I got!   I definitely want to come back with my boyfriend and go for the 12 course meal that I've read about from fellow yelpers!  Will update my review after I wake up from that coma. :)  P.s. They have the best tasting \"tap water\" ever. I saw a sign on the wall that says its Fuji water or something...not sure what that is, but it was really good and definitely worth mentioning. I love when restaurants add little perks like that. It's those small things that leave the biggest impact!",

Sashimi is supposed to serve in a very cold temperature, especially in Summer.     There's plenty of room for improvement.  $40/person for 12 courses are just way too big for one person.  The server should rethink when upselling an additional course.  My friend and I went to this restaurant, we wanted to share the 12 course menu for $39.99. the server told us, we must order one more dish sashimi plate $15.00.  We can't share without ordering this additional dish.  We did just that!   Whatever the green tea that was served tasted muddy and extremely bitter.    We ate the following:  2/5  the sashimi plate for 2. $15.00 ( I spat out a fish bone out of my salmon sashimi.  This is reason the rating is so low on this dish is no bone should ever been in a sashimi plate. I would have given a 4.5-5 with this dish if it weren't for the bone)  2/5 Miso soup: a little thin in taste.  We can barely tasted miso.  The soup in way too thin.   5/5.  The oyster: it's perfect!!  1/5.  The special roll: king crab. The crab and avocado together tasted bitter after first bite. We stop continue to finish this plate.  4/5. Tofu salad:   It was nicely done.   5/5 Squid (ika) carpaccio:  it was very well flavored.  We could Barlely continue at this point.    3.5/5 Sukiyaki: the favor is better than most places,  we were way too stuffed at this point and call it a quit.  Pack the rest home.    The speed of service was 2/5.  The server doesn't pay any attention to the progress we were making.  The table was too over crowded.  The lack of expediting control in our case.  It came out too fast with a smallest table they can mustered.   Friendliness: 2.5/5.   0: Serve food without attentiveness: zombie server or robot servers.  2.5+/-: -served with smile and quick to response. Rooms for improvements.  4.5:  Server with a warm heart.  Genuinely courteous.    The attentiveness: 1/5.  We have to wave down a server when needed, it takes times to wave down someone for service on a Friday night.   Server should always be one step ahead to observe if the customers need anything, clearing of plates, refill drinks.  We actually have to wave them all down for this service.  Sorry, the servers are not trained properly.   There are a few things that tasted great here. I would consider returning and may possible update my reviews.",

The waiters were always checking on us and filling up waters and delivering drinks nonstop. I never felt rushed ! So refreshing.

Our table still needed to be set up even after we sat down.   FOOD: 4.5/5 It would be a 5 if my stomach didn't hurt the next day. But like I said, I would be more than happy to come back for more.

    "text": "Came and dined here last week while I was in town. I myself had the 12 course meal while my dad got the Salmon Salad and mom got the Sumo Nabe. I would say that the Salmon Salad was a surprise in that they were very generous with the salmon and it wasn't just a leafy salad with a few pieces of salmon here and there.  My 12 course meal was quite good and was a lot of food. I would say definitely get the white tuna, it was really good. For dessert, you can skip the kakikoori. It seems that they pre shave the ice and you need to work hard to eat the ice.  Overall, for authentic Japanese food, the price and value was great. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!",

HORRIBLE service!!!!!You would think this is a self serve restaurant. Sat down never got our drinks till we asked for it...Empty in there, No excuse. The little service you do receive is very poor and they all seem more interested in hanging out and talking to each other behind the cashier. Absolutely no attention. I was hoping that the food would make up for the horrible service. The fish was not fresh, it looked like it was left out in the open for awhile all dehydrated, got FOOD POISONING!!!! as a result of our visit, we were completely incapacitated for the following 24 hours. Reporting to Southern Nevada Health District, you've been warned. No wonder they have to lie to the public by saying its there \"Renew\"? Raised the prices and reduced the size, I guess that should have been a sign.   Overall, I would not be back, there are so many good sushi restaurants and IZAKAYA in Vegas to settle for this one. Not worth the money at all and over priced at that! UGH!!!!",

But the actual food itself, isn't even worth one star. The ahi tuna was pink/white-ish, it's supposed to be red. The salmon was not buttery at all, it was fishy. Fresh salmon is not supposed to be fishy.  The rolls were not impressive, same issue with all the fish, it was not fresh, it didn't taste fresh.   I feel bad because the sushi chef was super nice, but the quality of the food will keep us from ever returning.",

We ordered a small sashimi boat, tako wasa, miso baked mackerel, Uni nigiri, cold marinated tofu, oysters, and an order of shrimp boat that they kindly put together upon my request. Everything was amazing!!!! Going to be my go to spot when I visit Vegas. A must try!",

    "text": "I'm from LA and I frequently come to Vegas for a mini vacation. I've never been here before and saw that the ratings were really good and it was the best choice I've made in a while! The food was delicious, fresh, and well presented. We ordered the big sashimi boat, the uni don, snow club, snow crab hand roll, and dragon roll.   Sashimi boat: soooooo good! around 30-40 pieces of sashimi on a giant wooden boat. Everything was super fresh and the pieces of fish were portioned really well. There was a huge variety of sashimi. We had three people and ordered a ton of food so I think it's a pretty good size for 2-3 people, especially if you're really hungry.   Uni don: incredibly fresh. A big helping of uni on top of rice with some small bits of seaweed in the rice. Definitely worth the price tag and every piece was quality.   Snow club: cut roll with snow crab meat on top of the roll and inside the roll. Also paired with avocado. Amazing quality of crab. Wish there was a little bit more crab meat but still really good nonetheless.   Snow crab hand roll: my mom had this custom made so it's not on the menu. But it's basically a hand roll with a couple of slices of snow crab meat inside. Good but not crazy amazing.   Dragon roll: classic cut roll. I loved this one; although it's something you can get pretty much anywhere this one is super unique in flavor. There's a smokey flavor to the eel and the sauces were so good. Definitely recommend!   Overall this is one of the best Japanese restaurants that I've been to and I would definitely recommend making the drive outside the strip to come eat here! Quality food and a reasonable price tag!",

    "text": "A very good neighborhood sushi joint / izakaya.  Not AYCE but it offers lots of value and flavor for your money.  Best part, there's something for everyone.  In general, the straight forward selection of fish is fresh and when frozen, properly thawed.   Texture and flavor on point.  Other ingredients are also fresh.  The rice for the sushi is good quality short grain, stickier than average and well seasoned.    A review from two palates.  Midwest poker bud:   - \"These baked mussels with mayo are good\".  - \"Oysters with soy ponzu and scallions FTW!\"  - \"This shrimp tempura roll with avocado, cream cheese, and eel sauce is so good.  So is this spicy crab with steak roll\".  - \"More yum yum sauce please\"!  Me:  - Kaisen chawan mushi is very good.  The custard is soft and uniform containing a good amount of dashi and therefore umami.  Generous topping of uni, snow crab, raw scallop, ikura, and a properly cooked shrimp all work.  The Kani chawan mushi (crab) equally good.  The sweet crab meat is coated with a crab stock that taste great mixed into the custard.  - Grilled fish, solid.  The salt grilled Saba, crisp skin, burnt bits for bitter notes.  Aggressively salted.  Firm texture and fishy goodness.  Hamachi Kama, also good with the same blistered texture and complexity.  Finally the miso salmon kama (think miso butterfish with its sweet mirin, sake lees, and miso goodness).  Straight up good eats.  - the big boat sashimi platter is impressive.  Five slices each of seven types of seafood, all naked, as is.  Solid and a bargain for $60.  The weak spot, The tempura. The batter is slightly too thick and chewy.    Neighborhood friendly and relatively efficient service.  Decent list of very fairly priced sake.  All told, one of the better neighborhood Japanese eateries.  Just keep your expectations in check.",

Sushi Takashi DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!   Coming in with an empty stomach after a long day hiking around Red Rocks, our eyes were a little bigger then our stomachs, but we devoured so much sushi it was worth it! It's located in the Chinatown section of Vegas, not too far from the strip.   We started out with the Avocado Treasure chest! Trust me, this thing is amazing! It's tuna, salmon, crab and shrimp wrapped in avocado and sitting in a pool of ponzu sauce. This is a show stopper! Order it and you will not be disappointed!   We also ordered a 12 piece chicken Kara-age (ask for the kewpie mayo), gyoza, spicy tuna roll, red dragon roll, shrimp tempura roll and tuna Hawaii roll. The rolls were so fresh, they were so delicious, we walked out of here stuffed!   Chef Takashi was behind the counter making our sushi rolls, we let him know we came all the way from Detroit just to try his rolls! This is such a gem among the big restaurants in Vegas, but this place definitely holds its own against the other restaurants around. You will not be disappointed!",

I liked how there was more fish to rice, rather than more rice to fish on the nigri and the rolls. My daughter loved the mini bowls of udon soup. Typically she has to choose between a gigantic bowl of udon or sushi. The mini bowls were the perfect size. The broth is \"home made\" and delicious. We sat in a wine cask booth that allowed for a nice feeling of privacy. If you drink sodas, please note that they serve cans of soda and it is $2.50 a can (!). If you are a prolific sushi consumer ( my son is known as the salmon slayer) your bill will be $$$$. My son said he enjoyed it, but worried about how much it cost. For more modest consumers who want very fresh sushi you will enjoy Takashi Sushi.",

Waters came out instantly.   They added curtains and a board in between the barrel booths to provide privacy; i think it also helps keeps noise level down-prevents the echo of conversations.   They have an expansive menu. Tons of options. We ordered several items, salmon rolls, yakiniku bowl, deep fried calamari, the avocado treasure chest and takoyaki.   Everything came out as they were prepared. The treasure chest was phenomenal. It was my favorite out of everything (so far, since I'll be coming back). I would say the presentation was wonderful too. It was truly a japanese tapas style meal. I wouldn't come here wanting to be overwhelmingly full; definitely small bites and sharing.   The food here is traditional Japanese. Come to this place looking for a palette adventures. The designs and presentations of these dishes is both eye catching and mouth watering. I would not come here to engulf food but rather take my time and really think about the blends of the flavors.  The service was perfect as well. They left us alone and came back at appropriate time frames. Water was always refilled. The staff was overall friendly and personable. I'll definitely come back to sushi Takashi to try their larger portioned combos as well as their smaller and unique dishes.",

I loved everything about this place! The service, the fresh sashimi, and especially the service!  I'm def coming back!!!!!",

They also offer a large selection of specialty rolls, interesting sampler platters, and a 10-12 course set meal. The prices are very reasonable but you can get a great deal  if you pick a dinner combination or go during happy hour. Service was quick and efficient. It's not an AYCE restaurant where you gobble down as much mediocre sushi as you can in 90 minutes. Stay, sit, and enjoy.",

The blue diamond roll may be one of the best rolls ever.   Salmon soup is perfectly flavored.   Ambience is outstanding. The booths are fair sized but the actual booth makes it feel larger.   Great service. Attentive without being intrusive. Takashi-san is a nice man and goes out of his way to say hello.  Best sushi in Vegas. No doubt about it.",

    "text": "I feel very lucky to have found Sushi Takashi, somewhat randomly selecting it based on a few Yelp reviews. We were visiting from out of town (everyone flying in from coast to coast) and I needed a family reunion dinner venue (11 people total - my older parents, two siblings, and four little nieces and nephews, one of whom has severe food allergies to nuts, gluten/wheat, soy, dairy, etc.). I selected Sushi Takashi simply because it was Japanese-owned and could accommodate a larger party, and because it was a range of ages, I wanted something family-friendly but not too touristy - i.e., not a Nobu or Sushi Samba, but not a Benihana.  The Sushi Takashi staff were SO accommodating and attentive, even though my family was \"That Party\" with all these random demands and being pretty high maintenance :-) Constant attention to our table by 3-4 different servers, our water glasses were never empty, we kept asking to order extra things (we were hungrier than we thought), and everything was extremely fresh, including the large sashimi platter.  My sister and I joked that we thought even the water tasted better than normal, and our server ended up informing us that the restaurant spends several hundred dollars a month on a special water filtering system - our taste buds were right!  We ended up going to Sushi Takashi two of our three nights in Las Vegas, and even on the one night that we ate a nearby Chinese restaurant, we made a special third trip back to Sushi Takashi to pick up a meal for my niece - the Chinese restaurant could not accommodate her food allergies, and she was crazy about the grilled salmon that Sushi Takashi specially prepared for her, so she was thrilled to eat it three nights in a row!  Mr. Takashi himself held court behind the sushi bar and couldn't be nicer - he spoke Japanese with my mother, and both nights he sent over complimentary miso soups, a turnip and butternut squash soup (truly delicious), and a sashimi/ceviche-style platter for our large group.   Thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality, Sushi Takashi, and my family has already decided this will be our go-to place whenever we come to Las Vegas.",

Amazing fresh fish beyond words, amazing presentation and two servers who patiently answered all my questions.  I had the seaweed salad to start followed by yellowtail carpaccio, the sashimi sampler and spoiled myself with some chutoro to end the meal.  I will be back soon and will be a frequent guest here.",

Once you decide to order the 10 or 12 course dinner set, the waiter will give you a piece of paper and you get to select the items you would like to order for each course.   I ordered the 10 course dinner set.  Edamame Super white tuna carpaccio Soba salad Salmon teriyaki  Signature roll - Steak roll  Shrimp tempura  4 piece nigiri  Miso soup  Sauteed asparagus Green tea ice cream   All of this for only $29.95!! Fantastic deal ! Everything was so yummy! I'm like drooling thinking about the meal right now. The fish was fresh and the cuts are fairly big! Definitely try the Steak Roll if you are down to try something new! It was surprisingly really good better than the other rolls my group ordered. Left this place with a full stomach and even left overs!   Worth the drive off the strip! Definitely will be back when I'm in vegas !",

As we entered the joint it look very Japanese and the booths were really nice, felt very private. We ordered a few things, toro sushi which didn't look like toro and was very fishy. The yellowtail was fishy as well and so was the Hakodate roll. The salmon was pretty fresh and the Uni/ikura don was delicious. They gave us a complimentary soup and two pieces of grill salmon nigiri. The service was good, waitress were friendly and welcoming.",

Service was prompt, and our waiter Sean was very helpful when we asked for drink recommendations, asking for our normal preferences bit still efficiently detailed their selection. We ordered the strawberry nigori, avocado treasure, garlic edamame, the sushi grid, and a salmon dish composed of sashimi, sesame oil and seeds, and an egg yolk.  Of all the dishes the only dish that was wanting was the sushi grid, as the rice to fish ratio was a little off. However, for the value of the item it was understandable. The garlic edamame was flavorful and well seasoned, the salmon dish was simple but excellent and you can't go wrong with the avocado treasure (an avocado stuffed with imitation crab meat and sashimi) Overall a great experience and would definitely return the next time we are in town.",

Maybe my first time in this establishment would be different from those entering without someone having a person knowing their particular taste. We ordered quite a few dishes from the ika sashimi, karaage, several edomae nigiri dinner sets, ikura and salmon bowl, kaisen bowl, natto maki ( my little ones must have their natto) yellowtail sashimi and some other items that I can't remember due to my food coma I'm trying to think through. Everything tastes incredibly fresh and everything seemed the proper temperature. Rice was a perfect proportion to the slices of fish for me. I always hate when you get an onigiri sized ball of rice ( redundant, I know) and a paper thin slice of fish. The Yuzu ice cream we finished our meal off was so delicious! My son had to have it the second night. Both nights our service was super prompt and friendly. Our server happened to over hear me gushing about the braised daikon and brought out little extra prepared daikon to enjoy with my other dishes. I thought that was so kind of him! The atmosphere is really cool. Not intimidating and the tables toward the back remind me of being inside a vineyard. Almost like you are partially enclosed inside a gigantic wine barrel. Really makes it seem like you and your party are the only ones in the restaurant. I'd say it's perfect for a date night.",

My boyfriend and I shared the meal where you get 3 of any of their specialty rolls (each usually cost $12-$15) and it also came with edamame, unlimited salad and miso soup, and ice cream to share. I cannot say enough about the salad! It salad always came dressed that way, I probably wouldn't eat anything else ever again! The sauce we light and sweet, and the salad came with a large slice of avocado and a slice of tomato. My mouth is watering thinking about it still! The miso soup was delicious. The vanilla ice cream was great. The edamame was salted just the way I like it. Okay, onto the rolls... We ordered the Red Dragon, Forgot Name, and the King Club. All three of them we as perfect as can be and sooo freaking good. Also, the ambiance in this place is on point! It's fresh and modern, great music.

    "text": "So, this was one of the highest rated restaurants that I have ever seen.  I am not a big sushi fan, but my wife loves it and this seemed to be off the charts.  So, I had to give it a try.  Boy, did it ever hit the ball out of the park.  This has to be one of my top five restaurants ever, worldwide.  My wife did the 10 course meal, which had her giggling with glee at how great everything tasted.  I tried their hot meals, which included Salmon Teriyaki, Beef Yakiniku and a half roll.  I tried the Blue Diamond, and I really liked it.  This is from someone who does not have the taste buds for sushi, sorry.  Every aspect of this meal was fantastic.  The salad dressing was amazing, I think I would have eaten weeds from my garden if it had that dressing on it.  The Beef Yakiniku absolutely blew me away, one of the best dishes I have ever tasted.  I tried random items from my wife's 10 course meal and after tasting each one, I was blown away how good the food tasted.  They topped it off with mango ice cream, actually more sherbet, but it was actually orgasmic.  Yes, that's right, I said it.  An old compliment my brother would say after a great meal is, after you finish you want to use bread to clean up all the gravy/sauce left over.  Yes, it was that good",

    "text": "Every sushi and dish we had represents Japan.  My wife found the restaurant from a blog of a Japanese resident of the town.  The location is off-the strip, and in a strip mall of the middle of Chinatown.  Nonetheless, the chef Takashi offered perfection of his creation.  We had nearly ten kinds of nigiri type sushi, fish on rice, plus grilled mackerel, fish cake stew, miso soup and pickled vegi.  Materials are very fresh, and precisely prepared.  Sushi rice was perfectly cooked and flavored. Of special note, the chef brighten up the flavor of salmon roe by marinating as the northern Japanese way.  The pickled vegi is also the northern Japanese version with rice based flavor.  Mackerel was nicely chosen and cooked perfectly.  The chef made great effort for the miso soup and fish cake stew, which can be recommended for every one who loves real Japanese food.  Another surprise came in the end, with the extremely generous size of bill.  I am sure that this restaurant will be the best sushi place in my town if he opens one. Or, I need to find a job in LV.",

When we got there it was happy hour so we got a few things from the food part. The sashimi boat came with a good amount of food and it was super fresh. We got the oysters and it was also really fresh. I ended up ordered a hand roll. I can tell you that the hand roll was definitely worth the price. It was super stuffed. I loved it. I can't wait to go back to this place so I can eat the yummy food again!   The service here was great too! Our server's name was Shaun and he was great. He was attentive and he made sure that any mistakes were taken care of right away.",

We try other Japanese places all the time but this is the only one we keep coming back to over and over.   All of the food is great. The Kama's are huge and the sashimi is fresh. The bentos are great with options for people who just don't like fish.   Specifically I dig the Sashimi Teishouku, the grilled Kamas, Any hand roll with Salmon and the all of the Capaccio plates. The bentos, donburi and rolls are great too. Try forgot name?, Grand Canyon and baked Fantasy roll.   They also have an amazing salmon avocado salad with a ceaser dressing. It is filling and I recommend to pay the extra and add salmon skin which is 10,000% worth it and makes it even more tasty.  The Cassis and Orange cocktail is entirely too drinkable and The Matcha Panna Cotta is sinfully good.  Another plus is the service is always solid and the staff know the menu well and will recommend items. They can also let you know wait times on specific items if you're in a rush and don't have restaurant kind of time but want restaurant kind of food. But honestly do this place justice and treat it as an experience. Set aside some time to enjoy the experience.   Also if you use the restroom enjoy the Japanese toilets they are rare in this city and add a bit of authenticity to the whole experience.   Will update with pics when I go back next time!",

The server kept rushing us to order drinks even though we told him we still had two more ppl coming. Then he rushed us to order appetizer and food. BEFORE OTHER TWO CAME lol felt like we were forced to order, so we did.... we were kind of scared lol  Of course, the food came out when other two arrived. Felt bad for them. The rushy server even brought my miso soup before my sushi came. I told him not to :( Japanese people don't have miso soup as appetizer.....  On top of that, he brought our check when we got our main entrees. why so rushing? Didn't enjoy the restaurant. Enjoyed the sushi though. Food was great. That's why I'm giving 4 stars.",

I don't usually splurge on sushi, since I like to get my money's worth and just settle for ayce sushi instead. But this place is definitely worth it! They have lots of different options of raw foods & cooked foods. They also had an AYCD (all you can drink) for $15 a person! Not bad at all... I thought there was worth your money. Unfortunately, we got in a bit too late for that.  I recommend giving this place a try if you're a sushi lover.",

I am a HUGE uni fan, I can tell instantly if it is fresh or not. This uni was presented beautifully and was so fresh it melted in my mouth.  The Grand Canyon roll was delicious.  The hamachi nigiri melted in my mouth and the hamachi was a great big piece.  The chefs special carpaccio is a must have! The chef prepared 3 different fish thinly sliced. Great way to try a little bit of different fresh fish.  Last but not least, my favorite dish of the night, the Yukgae Salmon.  It is minced salmon with a raw egg yolk on top. 100% everyone must order it.  100% recommend Sushi Takashi.  Thank you Chef Takashi!!!",

And boy, Sushi Takashi did not disappoint!  Service: Their service was absolutely amazing. Their waiters and waitresses were super attentive and constantly came by to check on us. It wasn't overbearing, but it was definitely nice to know how much they care about their people.   Food: Food. Oh man. It was great. My order was the large sushi boat. The presentation and the taste were amazing. Everything literally melted in your mouth. And the chefs were so kind, they gave us rolls and a salmon miso soup (not pictured, I forgot)  on the house. They were so good! Aaaah!!   Overall, I'm really glad we got to go to Sushi Takashi. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I'll definitely hit them up again!",

They also offer a Honzen-ryori inspired option (about 10 tapa-like dishes, if I remember correctly) that warmly reminded me of my time in Japan. The food was generally really good and I was STUFFED at the end at a fraction of the price I would pay on the Strip. 1-star deduction unfortunately for the oysters. We had a party of 4 - 3 of us ate the oysters - and 3 of us had some serious quality time with the porcelain throne about 3 hours later, while the one who abstained didn't. Just saying... so, aside from that snafu, the rest of the menu is pretty spot on.",

    "text": "This place is phenomenal. 12-courses? Heck yeah! Heed other Yelper's warning. There will be so much food.   I made reservations for dinner here on New Year's Eve. The service is impeccable. We were constantly being check by our servers making sure everything was to our liking.   A few changes to the menu based on the other Yelpers who tried this place before me. They included Salmon on their Teriyaki and removed the Baked and replaced it with Vegetables (Asparagus or Broccoli).   Here are the dishes that really stood out for me (good and bad):   1. Garlic Edemame: Way better than the regular one or the Pepperoncini. Do not think the pepperoncini will taste anything like the pickled peppers. It was just edemame with chili flakes.  2. Super-White-Tuna & Scallop Carpaccio: These were delicious! They tasted fresh and sweet which was really a surprise to me because I personally do not like raw food but I totally made an exception with this one.   3. Hamburger: Okay, this one is pretty weird and even our server admits it. I feel like it should not be part of the 12 course dinner. I'm guessing this is for people who do not really like sushi/raw fish so they can have an option. But this seriously left me dumbfounded. It is a full burger meal with fries and everything. It was not until after I finished the burger that out of curiosity, I asked if it can be changed to the other burger options (Teriyaki, Takashi, Teriyaki Tsukune, Salmon Fry Burger) and they said yes but it will be an additional charge. Good to know for future reference.  4. Beef Sukiyaki: This was really delicious. The soup was a little sweet to my taste but the beef was so tender that I still loved the dish over all. Definitely get this over the Diced Steak. The steak was dry and the flavor was peppery so I was not really a fan of that. Plus who wants hard steak anyway?  5. Corn and Egg Soup: I would recommend something else rather than ordering this. I was pretty disappointed with it. A little too sweet too.  After two hours of battling against food, I am proud to say that I finished. They should really give some sort of medal/award to people who can actually finish. That was a lot of food! Next time I come back, no more 12-course meal. I would come back to order little bits of things that I liked.   Thank you, Chef Takashi. That was definitely a good way to end my 2015.",

The servers were always checking on us, replacing plates and refilling our water.  The chef even sent out some cool candies and snacks for our son, so nice of him. Will def come back again!   And to the guy complaining about it being too much food, are you crazy?! That's like complaining about getting paid too much or a buffet having too many selections. Just plain crazy especially since they box left overs for you to take home.",

I happened to get a shrimp nigiri which I didn't want, but I should have told the server - my bad. *Dragon roll: I picked this one from Takashi's signature rolls. *Miso soup: It was pretty thin and I couldn't taste much of miso... *Azuki ice cream: I picked this one over my usual green tea.. Very tasty.. (at this point, it was almost miracle I was able to finish ice cream!!)  *Service was good and Chef Takashi is fun to talk to!  We will definitely come back soon!!",

We were initially going to a Japanese tapas place but when we got there it was closed. Luckily I made reservations for sushi takashi and we were able to get seated right away in one of their cute little booths. The decor is simple but has very nice appeal. Over the phone they told me all you can eat was $80 and I was prepared to pay that but when we got to they restaurant, they offered lots of different  choices. We ended up having a 12 course meal and a sashimi spread for 2 for way less than $80/ per person. Needless to say the service, food, and presentation was 100% I think we just found our new sushi spot.",

    "text": "OMG, who knew Vegas can have such good sushi! Like, why aren't you in the Bay Area!?!?!? I came here this past December with my uncle who lives in Vegas. He knows the good local spots, and I fly to Vegas every 2 or 3 months or so. So what caught my eye first....Japanese sushi chef! Takashi-san does a tremendous job molding sushi and cutting fish. Originally we were planning to order the limited time offer, $50 bucks for a sashimi platter for I think 2 people, each! However, the Kaiseki-Ryori or the 12-course sushi dinner got my attention instead. About $40 for the 12 course dinner, which would be considered dirt cheap in SF for the quantity and quality of food. Yeah, I know cost of living is a lot higher in SF, but damn I feel like a baller when I'm eating in Vegas.  I took a picture, of most of things I ate, but I couldn't fit it all into one photo because it was too many items lol. We received an additional 13th item on the house, a salmon miso soup which was delicious. You get a sheet with a combination of your order. You basically get to select 1 of 2 or 3 different selections per course to customize your meal. Everything was on point. I don't think there was even anything I would even consider just average, it was all great! My uncle and I were conversing with Takashi-san during dinner in Japanese. I'm not 100% fluent, but I was able to communicate and I felt that that made the experience so much better. It was like chatting with an old friend or acquaintance.  I've been back to Vegas twice already in 2017, but unfortunately have not been able to make it back out here because they are open for dinner only and my uncle's work schedule hasn't allowed us to come back on the days I visit. I will be back for sure in June when I drive down to Vegas with my dad!",

The booths had a wine barrel like design around the top and the tables was a nice glossy wood.  Order the 12 course meal it's worth every penny. I got fuller here than any all you can eat sushi buffet. My 12 course meal came with appetizer (miso soup, salad), a plate of teriyaki meat, fried tempura, my special roll dish \"Honda\" awesome sauce and goodies that come with it, 4 piece sashimi, 4 piece raw oysters yum, and strawberry ice dessert (shaved ice). Overall what a fantastic deal.  Coming again!",

    "text": "I am really disappointed that I have to leave this type of review. Found this place on yelp and saw its high praise and was really prepared to have a nice dinner with my fiance. When we arrived we were told there was no seating available at that moment and that there would be a 20 minute wait (we were the only ones waiting at that time) but hey, that's fine, no problem! The guy we were speaking to then said with a snarky attitude that people usually call and make reservations and maybe we should do that next time. Ooooook, thanks for the tip pal. We go outside to wait since there's not much of a waiting area unless you want to block anyone coming in or out. When I step outside I notice two seats at the sushi bar that are empty but there's a bus boy bin that had been left there. We wait about 15 minutes and go in and ask about it since they are two perfectly good seats that just need the dirty dish bin moved. They said they didn't realize those seats were available and they'll clean it up for us now. Annoying but fine. A booth ends up opening at the same time so we take this instead. Time to start ordering! Except even this is a bit of the mess, I have to ask for 3 different types of beverages because they were out of the first two I asked for. We get our cans of soda and this is the last time our waiter acknowledges our existence. Our food is brought out by someone else and we somehow end up getting our appetizer AFTER our main dishes . I ordered the Tokyo roll which was good (a little heavy on the sauces) and the steak roll (trying to be adventurous) and it was disappointing and kind of gross. The steak is laid across the top of the roll and didn't seem to be seasoned at all so didn't really contribute much to the roll in flavor. Then I realize that the underside of each piece of steak is completely raw, they seared one side which is showing but the rest is raw. Now I understand I'm at a sushi restaurant, I can deal with raw fish, but I can deal with totally raw beef, especially when it doesn't specify in the menu the steak will be raw. Didn't finish the roll. Not ONCE did anyone check on us to see if everything was ok or if we needed another drink. Our waiter seemed to go out of his way to avoid us. I was finally able to flag down someone for the check and the bill was just shy of $70 for 4 rolls, 2 of which weren't great, 1 appetizer that came late, and 2 cans of sprite. Our normal spot will usually cost me $50 max and the food and service are a hell of a lot better. Really disappointed in the whole experience and totally wasted my money.",

    "text": "I've seen my extremely picky father 100% satisfied with a restaurant 3 times in my entire life. This was one of them.  After yet another failed attempted of trying to go Raku (which seems to always and forever be booked solid on my trips to Vegas), my dad and I decided to walk over to Takashi instead, since Raku's hour long wait was too much for us (we were pretty hungry). We managed to snag the very last table. We each decided on a course menu - 10 course for me (29$) and 12 course for him (39$). Despite the stellar reviews, I wasn't really expecting my dad to enjoy it (he's the definition of a sushi snob).  But after course after course of incredibly fresh, delicious Japanese goodness (from oysters to sashimi to sushi to soba noodle salad to tempura to soup to dessert), I've found a new all-time favorite that I'll definitely be going to whenever I'm in Vegas. Everything was perfect - the food, the price, and the service. And seeing my dad so enamored by a restaurant (something that happens as often as certain cosmic phenomena, meaning every decade or so) was a rare pleasure. He didn't complain once! Miracles do happen!  Overall, I highly, highly recommend Takashi. It's fantastic!",

The one with the jalapeno on top was perfect  - Service was a tad slow  - All of the above for $83!!!  Unbelievable",

Sushi Takashi is the medium between ayce sushi/copy and paste sushi chains and high end sushi. You can get a lottt of food for only $40. The value is ridiculously high.   The 12-course meal for $40 is something else! You definitely can't get this in California and can easily split this between two people. I'm coming back for this.   The only downside of the meal was the wait. It was very busy in the dining/sushi area and our meal took 1h40m to complete. Be mindful that Takashi is working hard and friendly to the staff! Awesome place!",

I made a visit to Sushi Takashi, because it was conveniently located near where I was staying and I was craving sushi, but it did MORE than deliver.  When I first walked in, I was extremely impressed by the decor. It was aboslutely beautiful with solid wood tables, sleek slate plates and these magnificent barrel seating booths.   I got the AYCE option ($80, but you can certainly choose one of the many less expensive options), sat at the sushi bar and left it to Chef Takashi (no one knows better than the chef himself) to decide what he would serve us. There was a huge variety of fish, all of exceptional quality, prepared in a variety of styles (sashimi, hand rolls, nigiri.) My favorites were the chu-toro, spanish mackerel and the salmon miso soup, all items that I typically don't find in sushi shops. Chef Takshi presents his ingredients in an artistic manner where everything shines- the fish, the rice, the seaweed etc.",

Just because it's quiet don't under estimate the quality. It doesn't remind me of Japan quality but for the price the quality is pretty darn good. I got a sashimi combo and it came with soup and rice. The soup was a great fish bone broth. Milky and creamy. Food was more than enough for one and left me wanting to come back the next day.",

    "text": "Sooo... giving a 2 star, because I'm not a fan of \"bait and switch\" tactics and the food was just okay, but pricey for the quality.  I'm new in town and ordered a lot of certificates off of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> to try out places and my spots that I'd want to go back to.  I arrive here with my $10 off coupon and as I sit, I'm told that they can't take my certificate.  This is the 1st time any place has ever refused, so I was surprised.  The guy goes on to tell me that they stopped accepting these \"awhile ago\" and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> was notified.   Well, I was already there and I was starving, so I went ahead and ate (I'll review the food in a minute).  However, once I got home, I get online to find out how to address this with <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>, as I paid for this certificate.  Come to find out, THIS restaurant is STILL on there... like right now, I can buy a certificate!!  Sooo, I just called the restaurant and asked how long ago they quit honoring these and he said about 3 weeks ago.  I advised it's still on the website and he said they're \"trying\" to get it off.  The right thing to do is honor certificates that are purchased while using this site for advertisement, but the fact that they aren't doing that let's me know they take the less than ethical route.  So oh well.  They claim I should be able to get my money back from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>... we shall see.   In regards to the service/food.. the waitress was good.  The food was just okay.  Again, new in town... I don't knew what the norm is for sushi spots here, but I'm used to either much better quality or a lower price.  For the prices here, I'd think the rolls would be packed with plump/fresh ingredients and plates nicely decorated... but nah.  Both rolls were overly sauced and the shrimp was tiny... the total for these 2 rolls (see pic) was $24.74 (drank free water), so with tip, I paid $30.  And this was happy hour prices, which applied to 1 of the rolls.  Again, it didn't taste bad... but it didn't taste great and definitely wasn't worth $30.  :(  My search for a go-to sushi spot is still on... shoot me a message if you have a suggestion!  :)",

Unfortunately I was sick a few hours later. Good thing my friend was okay. I guess that's the luck of the draw when you eat uncooked food. The only thing that I ate that my friend didn't was the free ice cream for checking-in on Yelp and the mint leaves.

Even though I'm not lactose intolerant, I'll be sure to skip the ice cream next time! :)",

Got their udon small bowl for under 5 bucks...soba small bowl under 5 bucks...their chawan mushi is seriously so tasty...probably the best in the states?? Yes actually the best in the states for sure!! Also got their edomae nigiri which was a really good deal...a little over 2 bucks per sushi piece...overall seriously incredible meal!! And got a bottle of the suigei (drunken whale) and it's a really good deal for 40 bucks!! Delightful dinner for a fraction of the strip price!!",

Perhaps that is why said their sushi was average.  We ordered scallop, fatty yellowtail, and sweet shrimp. The sweet shrimp was very good. The rest of the sushi was average.   The rolls that we oreder i cannot remember the names but like I metioned before average size but they tasted good.  If youre looking to trying a new plce to have sushi i would say its worth it.",

    "text": "What a special place. Takashi, to me, has done a brilliant job to create a vibe. That was a highlight for me: everything was fantastic. The mood, the temperature in the space, the sound.  The food: just, yes. I am a bit of a purest and love nigiri the most. The fish was gorgeous. Thick, fleshy, extra fresh and tenderly prepared hand cuts over just-right rice. (Another reviewer commented about the rice, he was spot on. It is completely perfect.)    My friend eats only Kosher and asked for something custom. Takashi and his waitstaff did not disappoint. I was so grateful for the accommodation they showed us.   The waitstaff: so gracious. Very responsive, never intrusive, welcoming. Cool cats who do a great job to control the flow.   The restroom: clean and sweetly decorated.   Pro Tip: If you love the special cuts of Blue Fin, order them first. I wanted more O-toro in the second round, but the kitchen had run out of all varieties of Blue Fin by that time. Bummer? Yes. On the other hand, kudos to the chef for his wisdom to choose limited availability over serving anything less than impressively special. Oh yeah, fresh wasabi? A must.   Look to Takashi to deliver excellence in a soft and delicate way. Subtle but undeniable because of the warmth, attention to detail, and consistency.",

It tasted the way real sushi rice is supposed to taste.  Not wet, not dry, not sugary, and most importantly not over portioned. The rice is not important you say? WRONG.  The rice is EVERYTHING.  Unlike almost every other sushi-wanna-be place in this city, they are not selling you a fistful of rice with a chip of fish imbedded in it.  They serve a very FRESH, skillfully presented, single bite artfully laid across a reasonable portion of sushi rice that will leave you with the deep understanding of why the Japanese eat seafood in the first place - because it's crazy delicious! And the O-toro...OMG! Will I try anything else on the menu?  Sure, probably. But for right now I'm not worried about if they have the best fusion rolls, or best Japanese beers, or tastiest Japanese whiskeys (yes, I saw that bottle of Hibiki on display near the front door...). The sushi here is the real deal, it's authentic, it's outstanding.  That's the only reason you need to visit this place.  Oh, yeah... the green tea imported from Japan is really good, too!",

I cam late for the happy hour deal from 9-12pm, and was told 3 separate times about a strict midnight close, last call at 11:30pm, and kitchen closing at 11:30pm.  We said no big deal but the waiter was very pushy with us.  Ass far as the meal goes, everything was fantastic.  The sushi was fresh and very thick with the tuna and salmon innards.  The salmon tartar dish was super fresh and quite large, and with the addition of a runny egg was a great choice.  The sake was meh to be honest, even as a typical house variety.  Overall the food was above average but the prices reflect that, even on the Happy Hour menu.  Service was intrusive and not very friendly especially since there was only about 1 other group of people there during our dining experience. I liked the meal, but I will continue in my search for the best late night spot.  I think Takashi is just on the silver tier of this search, not gold.",

This gentleman takes pride in his work, with each offering being carefully constructed using only the freshest ingredients, meticulous presentation, and a desire to create a memorable experience.  I often judge a sushi chef by his nigiri; is the sushi meshi flavored well and served at body temperature, is the fish fresh and generous in portion, just the right amount of wasabi layered between, and is the proportion of fish to meshi balanced?  Chef Takashi nailed it on all accounts!  The rest of the meal followed suit, culminating in a complimentary dessert that melted in your palate.  My wife and I came to Vegas to celebrate our 25th anniversary, hoping to indulge in some quality sushi, we were blown away.  We will be back...thanks Chef Takashi for the memorable experience!",

    "text": "The truckload of food that Takashi pushes out for his $40 twelve course dinners make Restaurant Week look like Restaurant Weak.  Seriously... you would need to attach a garbage disposal to your stomach to make it through this bad boy.  Maybe if my car broke down up on Mount Charleston and I walked all the way here would it be possible?  So while value, ambition, friendly service, and remarkable design upgrades cannot be denied, my fault is with the execution and general flow of the menu.  Even for myself, I find it hard to believe I am complaining about too much food, but I am going there.     As an example, course plate #4-#8 could easily go chicken teriyaki, huge sushi roll, 6 oysters, karaage (fried chicken) and then beef sukiyaki.  That's like a mixtape going from Mozart to Slipknot to Whitney Houston to last year's Grammy winning polka artist.  Why are oysters right in the dead center of the 12?  Who goes from fried meat to sukiyaki in real life?    Something like this should be harmonious from beginning to end, but I just looked at it as battles within battles.  The menu vs my stomach capacity, the food vs the ever-growing takeout bag the servers kept loading up, my waistline vs my pants, my tastebuds' sanity vs \"holy shit, we're only on #5??\"  A server informed us that only one person had been able to plow through it all since they opened and that \"He was a Yelper\".  Nice job, Yelper.  Did you go to Home Depot or Lowe's for that attachment? ;)  If you're still going to do this, these are the battles between course choices:  #3: Soba Salad vs Tofu Salad vs Potato Salad: My wife's Soba Salad won.  The dressing mixed with the cold noodles and crisp greens were excellent.  You also get a choice of salad topping (grilled salmon, chicken or salmon skin).  We both went with grilled salmon although perhaps the salmon skin might have come off like a luxurious crouton and been the way to go.  Don't load up on potato!  Trust me.    #6: Oysters vs Snow Crab: It was a TKO by the oysters.   Even though the crab was nicely presented on a chilled plate, it could never be a match of 6 large raw oysters on a wooden boat.  This would retail for at least $18 elsewhere.  I will be back for this the next time dining a la carte.     #7: Tempura vs Karaage: We barely touched either of these due to fullness and what was still to come, but I'd go with the tempura which was a nice medley of veggies along with 2 pieces of shrimp.  Even though the karaage was dry and uninspiring, it lasted better in the fridge whereas tempura should be eaten immediately and was really bad a couple of days later.    Already stuffed to the gills, it was at this point that we considered asking to return tomorrow to finish the rest.  Would it be OK if I just left my credit card overnight?  I saw that there was a foot spa in the same plaza.  Maybe we could come back in an hour?  That moment sounded as good a time as any to take up cigarette smoking.    #8: Beef Sukiyaki vs Diced Steak:  Bitch, please.  Not only did the steak not put up a fight, they didn't even walk into the ring.  Flawless victory!  The sukiyaki was classic.  It was rich and filled with noodles, vegetables and semi-fatty beef which made the broth even better.  We asked for a side of raw egg to dip the beef into, and that made those 6 combined bites we took before they whisked it away in takeout boxes even better.  This could have been a standalone entree.    #9: Mini Doria vs 4 pc Baked Fantasy:  They should get rid of this course altogether.  The doria is a bowl of rice topped with a mix of ground beef, tomato sauce and cream.  No one in their right mind would want this after everything else.  Ditto for a gross hot sushi roll filled with cream cheese.  Lose, lose.    Server: \"Anything else?\" Me: \"Lap band surgery.\"  #10: 4 piece nigiri vs Salmon Bowl (more rice!) vs Hamburger:  Nigiri won.  It was the smallest portion of food!  Tony T was at another table and got the hamburger which was a FULL HAMBURGER, BUN AND ALL WITH FRIES.  Am I going crazy?    Some may avoid this spot because their AYCE is $80 per person, but with the exorbitant amount of food we walked out with, it'll be more about all you can't eat.  There were 5 more individual meals with the leftovers we had!  Portions should be halved, if not quartered, and everything needs to be rearranged by someone with sane eyes.   No one would complain about paying $40 for that.",

    "text": "Can the newest inhabitant of the former Cafe de Japon / Hiromaru Ramen spot in Cathay Plaza achieve longevity? If tonight's imperfect yet delicious meal is an indication, then it should.  Michael K.'s glowing review piqued my interest in Sushi Takashi, and when a friend invited me here, I eagerly accepted. I arrived a bit before the official 5pm start and was greeted by warm employees and cool air. The decor bears little resemblance to past businesses, with wooden tables and floors and bright but not overpowering light.  While waiting for my companion, I was able to peruse the a la carte menu and the various combination menu offerings. The three roll combo ($25.95) and the bottomless dinner ($22.95) both seem like decent options for another time, and even the AYCE offering for $79.95 might be worth a splurge on a special occasion (when asked, the server said that 2 orders of carpaccio could be included in addition to the premium items listed in fine print).  However, I'd already set my mind on the 12-course sushi dinner ($39.95), which contains sukiyaki, a choice of oyster or king crab, and a couple of other small upgrades when compared to the 10-course dinner ($29.95).  Before critiquing the food, I should note that the flow of the dishes was a little bit rushed at times, but nothing was left out too long, and they postponed dessert until we were ready.  Complimentary appetizer: Kakinotane. Rice crackers with soy and wasabi flavorings. Great crunch. The wasabi packs a punch if you're not accustomed to it.  #1: Edamame. My friend's peperoncino didn't add much flavor, but I loved my choice of garlic. Perfectly cooked beans to boot.  #2: Carpaccio. Yellowtail and scallop, shared. Both were delightfully fresh, and the roe was a nice topping for the scallop. Best dishes of the night.  #3: Salad. Sampled some of my friend's tofu w/ salmon skin. Some of the better tofu that I've had for sure, but the skin was a little too charred for my taste. My soba salad was ridiculously good with a powerful but not sickeningly heavy dressing, slick noodles, and substantial and tasty grilled salmon.  #4: Teriyaki meat. The beef was tasty and grilled, and it was more tender than tough. I see no reason to choose chicken unless beef is strictly outside of your diet.  #5: Sushi roll (shared). The King Club roll featured king crab, although I hesitate to call it the star. Its flavor was lost until eaten alone. I wouldn't order it again since the proportion of the crab isn't sufficient. The second roll, Blue Diamond, was the better option. It featured salmon, cucumber, and super white tuna in garlic ponzu.  #6: Seafood cold dish. We both chose oysters. Each plate featured four plump oysters (an apparent downsize from prior weeks) and a parsley garnish. They were thoroughly fresh, plump, and flavorful, and as of this writing have not assaulted either of our digestive systems. I'd pick this again as well.  #7: Fried food. We both chose tempura, which is a generous basket of three shrimp tempura and six vegetable tempura. The batter was a little too prominent and the sauce a little too weak. I'd pick something else next time.  #8: Beef. We both had sukiyaki, which was presented in a very hot bowl. This is where we started to exceed capacity, and the best thing about this not being an AYCE meal is that doggy-bagging something is not a problem. I did eat a small portion, and it was delightful with tender beef, silky tofu, and a sweet broth.  #9: Hot entree. We both chose the mini doria. I'd liken it to lasagna, but with rice. This ground beef and rice bowl is out of place on the menu because of its prominent tomato flavoring. It's good, but the 4 piece baked roll would better match the menu (and not require stomach expansion). But hey, more leftovers!  #10: Miscellany. I went into left field with the burger. With gooey cheese, toasted bun, and onions, it's surprisingly tasty. The medium doneness of the patty was acceptable. However, the fries that accompanied the burger were not so good. They were salted properly and fluffy inside, but their exteriors were mostly devoid of any sort of crunch. I would skip the burger solely to avoid having to see the pale yellow potato pieces ever again.  #11: Soup. Creamy corn sounds good, but it was very watery. I was almost too full to care at this point, but it's a shame that good egg and corn would have their flavor so diluted.  #12: Dessert. Nothing special about my friend's matcha jelly with ice cream. My tempura ice cream wasn't exceptional either, but the sweetness of the toppings somehow hit the spot at the right time. Neither choice can be mistaken for gourmet or premium.  Despite some flaws, the meal was great. I could see myself returning soon. The poster outside highlights the history of Chef Takashi as a pioneer of AYCE in Las Vegas, but his featured non-AYCE offerings would satiate all but the most stretchy-stomached. And hey, there's even a stamp card for 10- and 12-course dinner.",

Too bad the music selection was pretty bad - like Fall Out Boy bad - didn't mesh with the relaxed and mature setting. The service was attentive but not intrusive.  No AYCE here, but they offer a 3 roll dinner combination for $22 that comes with edamame, salad, miso and ice cream.  Their rolls are quite large so that's AYCE for me.  The 10 and 12 course options are A LOT of food - we had to tap out a couple courses early and skip right to dessert.  We were able to get the rest boxed up.  The standouts from the huge meal were the carpaccio, shrimp tempura with vegetables, and fried salmon.  I also ordered some uni nigiri which was top notch and definitely worth the $5 per piece.  The shaved ice dessert is amazing - I would go back just to eat this.  I can list a lot of things I would go back for and I would highly recommend this spot.",

    "text": "I'm not sure how many times I've been here now, but definitely more than 10 times! I first took my boyfriend here last year for his birthday when I was looking for an omakase. So that's what we first ordered - an omakase, the 12 course dinner for each of us. And wow, that was a lot of food. Plus, everything was super tasty! We were already full, but kept on eating as more dishes were being delivered to our table...! The omakase was pretty cheap too, $80 for both of us, and we had leftovers.  We were beyond satisfied with the food, so we've become regulars at Sushi Takashi since then. It's our go-to place on Friday nights during their happy hour.  HAPPY HOUR is from 9pm - 12am $1 Miller Lite on Fridays For the specials rolls, it's not really any cheaper. Half-price for half-roll so it's the same. But the other items in the happy hour menu are pretty good deals. I usually get a salmon bowl!  Our absolute favorite roll is their Tempura Loooouuuulll (I probably did not spell that right, but just say Tempura LOL and don't laugh out loud).  Food - 2/2 Atmosphere - 1/1 I LOVE the barrel booths. Customer service - 1/1 The chefs and staff on Friday nights recognize us now. Chef Koji gave us Japanese candy one time. :) Price - 1/1 My Overall - 5/5",

I found the Toro Nigiri particularly tasty.   I'd also recommend the iced green tea, which is very refreshing in the heat of Las Vegas during the summer.    There are two sides to the menu: one is very traditional and the other half, not so much.  Both are great in their own right, but if you really want to enjoy your meal, consider what you're ordering carefully because the selection is vast.  Personally, I enjoyed the more traditional fair like Nigiri Sushi and Tataki.    Service was a solid 5-stars, and we enjoyed the melon ice cream they gave us at the end; it was a cute finishing touch to a good meal.",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to go here for a long time and I was happy that my friends and I were able to make it this time. We were a pretty large group so we ended up ordering a whole bunch of things across the table and the food was spot on across the board.  A couple of friends and I split the Sashimi Big Boat. It looks every bit as gorgeous as the pictures and the sashimi is absolutely delicious. You get more than 50 slices in the order which is easily enough to feed three. There is such a variety in the fish they serve on the boat that your visual, olfactory and gustatory senses are surprised and delighted at every bend. It is just such an experience exploring the boat discovering treasures hidden everywhere. The quality of the fish is outstanding and they do not skimp or cheap out in the slightest. This is probably the most value for money meal I've ever had in Vegas in all these years.  We also got a special plate of OToro which at $4 a slice is an experience worth having. It's some of the best sushi money can buy at a price point that is still affordable. It wasn't cut perfectly and was falling apart which it's not quite supposed to even though it's that tender, but I understand it's a very difficult ingredient to work with and in the Vegas heat it can happen.   The chef was really kind and made us a couple of his special off-the-menu rolls on the house. They were so incredibly good. Every single one of us was extremely full at this point and had just finished talking about how we couldn't eat another bite; and then when they came out, they looked and smelled so amazing that we just gobbled them up.  We ended the meal with Macha Panna Cotta which was so silky smooth and delectable and just put a smile on everyone's faces.   Some of our friends also ordered a bunch of ladders, karage, gyoza and rolls and everyone said they loved every single thing they ordered.  Overall the food is outstanding, the service is spot on, the portions are massive, the quality of the fish is excellent and the price is almost to good to be True. An absolute MUST VISIT if you're in Vegas and like Sushi.",

    "text": "Was recommended by a friend to go here, never would have found this place in my own! We were a group of four girls headed out for the night and this was our first stop.   They sat us in a table next to the sushi bar and then pulled down a shade the blocked the entrance and made our table feel so intimate and private, awesome!!  The menu shows pictures of everything they have, wonderful mouth watering pictures that make you want to order everything! Each item also lists the calorie content which is so wonderful, it definitely helps me choose between 2 items when I'm having trouble. So many options, so hard to choose, but I picked out a Salmon and Avocado Salad and Yellowtail Carpaccio. Both were so good, the fish was so fresh and melted in your mouth, I'm getting hungry again thinking about it....  The decor was nice, our waiter was wonderful and so patient with us (it's hard to make decisions, ok?!). Can't wait to go back!",

The fried calamari and gobo tempura were delicious. The chazuke (rice and tea) is super comfort food.    Also got some nigiri. Tamago, Ebi, and Unagi. All three nigiri were outstanding. The Unagi piece were huge.   The cost is very reasonable. We will definitely be back for more exceptional Japanese food.",

We shared the big Sashimi Boat. Which was out of this world. Had some fish we've never had before & some fish that we had but it was better here. After the boat we had some other things. Baked green mussels. I didn't like the spicy one. I had a Salmon Skin cut roll which was just perfection. No one forgot my gobo. I didn't see the check but I know it was over $200.00 but worth every penny. I would Love to come every week but let's make it every other week just to be on the safe side.",

    "text": "Three and a half star. Came by for a late dinner around 10pm on the weekend.  Thing I loved:  -Kani Chawan-Mushi: best dish of the night. The egg custard was soft and silky smooth and had plenty of egg flavor in it. The crab sauce on top worked great with the eggs. The combination of steam eggs and crab sauce was lovely. Each ingredient hold its own, no one overpowered the other, very well balanced.  Things I liked: -Ginger Hamachi: I ordered from the signature sushi section; it was my favorite piece of nigiri. The slight hint of ginger flavor worked well with the yellowtail.  -rest of the nigiri: I ordered fresh water eel(Unagi), sweet shrimp(Amaebi), Sweet Egg(Tamago) I thought it was just a bit too sweet for my taste, scallop(Hotate), Otoro and all of them were fine. Rice was seasoned properly, the fish seemed to be fresh. The sushi were better than average but not quite make it to my Las Vegas top 3.  Things I didn't like: - all the fried stuff: I ordered Chicken Karaage, Soft Shell Crab Tempura, fried shrimp head from the Sweet Shrimp nigiri. Seasoning was fine for all of them but my problem was that they were greasy and heavy. Afterward I felt like drank a spoonful of oil.  Overall experience and service were fine. Probably will be back for the Chawan Mushi and nigiri but no thanks to the fired items.",

    "text": "Fresh sushi, nice environment, great options! I first went here a few times when I moved here a couple of years ago because it was nearby where I lived. I haven't forgotten about this place since, but tried other sushi spots around the area and I must say, \"how could I?!\" because this place is so good!  Tonight, I ordered the SASHIMI & TEMPURA TEISHOKU combo. It was a sweet deal for being about $24. Included: Sashimi: 2 pieces each of 6 kinds. Tempura: 2 shrimp, 4 selections of vegetables. Served with miso soup, rice, and pickled vegetables. The pickled vegetable for this was daikon in some Japanese style that Chef Jay was telling me. I love daikon in soup, and this was my first having it the way they served it. I loved it! Warning thought as it may not be for everyone. Hahah.  Chef Jay's seared salmon nigiri is so fresh and melts in your mouth. The way he made the salmon poke mini side bowl with seaweed was also great and wish I took photos of both dishes.  ENVIRONMENT: There are these cool private booths that look like huge barrels, there are a few small tables, and a sushi bar to sit at. I recommend the private booths that are more intimate or for groups OR the sushi bar so you can talk and ask questions with the chef.  DRINKS: Wow. Just, wow. The selection of Japanese booze is amazing. I love that they have them by selection and description. Some go by glass and/or bottle. The cocktails looked good too. A strawberry cocktail (milk and strawberry liquor with a strawberry Pocky stick?!! Whoa.) I ended up ordering a Plum Wine, Nanbu Bijin Mutu, which didn't have any sugar and was perfect because I'm trying to cut my sugar down. Mondays they have $1 Miller Lites.  PARKING: There's free parking in the lot out front in the plaza.  HAPPY HOUR: 9PM until ? and not sure if that's daily or not. I've had their happy hour before and there are some good selects. They have $1 nights Sunday-Thursday so check their website out for specific details as to what will be $1.",

    "text": "Update for 2019 - I can't believe it's been over a year since I've reviewed this place. My wife and I frequent this restaurant even though we live clear on the other side of town. The service and quality of sushi at this place is consistently awesome. As of the last few months, they've made some exciting additions to the menu.   If you catch them at the right time, they have different fresh fish flown in from Japan that you won't find anywhere else. I had some fresh Aji from Japan here the other day and it was out of this world.   Another exciting addition to their menu is their Signature Nigiri - they take their already amazingly fresh sushi and take it to a whole new level. One that really stood out for me was the \"Chanel\" - some amazing Chutoro topped with some uni and their house made ponzu sauce. It doesn't get much better than that in a one biter! If you're big on uni - this is the only place in town that I know of with a giant uni bowl.  I always find myself ordering the edomae nigiri or a sashimi boat.  If you want something for starters - their oysters are always top notch quality and the salmon carpaccio is to die for.  The atmosphere is just great here - super chill and casual with amazing food. Even the water tastes great. They are still serving RO filtered water for you to drink which just shows how thoughtful they are.  This place does get pretty packed at times, so be patient with the servers because they have a lot of people to satisfy. The sushi comes out relatively quick and it's nothing short of amazing.  If you're looking for some recommendations or good conversation, the sushi chefs are very friendly.  You can really see what great pride they take in preparing your sushi.  My advice - make a reservation if you can and be sure to check out the happy hour / daily specials that they have! This place is the real deal at a fair price.  You won't go home hungry.  I forgot to add - this place is now on Postmates but I still recommend you dine in to get the full experience!",

I usually come with my mom or my friend, Madoka. But my dad suggested Takashi tonight!  They have happy hour and daily specials, which are all great!  All of their fish is fresh and their dishes are made to perfection!  I recommend their uni don, ikayaki, salmon avocado salad, the treasure roll (some kind of roll with avocado on top and assorted fish inside), and they also have big beautiful wooden boats where the nigiri is placed on (nigiri sets).   This is the place where food is like art and it definitely shows!   Service is always wonderful! I can tell they genuinely care about their customers.   As for the restaurant itself, it's clean. And their woman's bathroom has a heated toilet! Woo!   We love eating here. It brings back memories of eating in Japan!   The Delos Reyes family loves Sushi Takashi!",

Starting with the Avocado Treasure a beautifully presentation of fresh layered avocado filled with shrimp, crab, scallops, salmon and poke. A wonderful surprise for two and almost a meal in itself. The Tempura LoouooLL, Shrimp Tempura, Imitation Crab, chopped Scallop, topped with Avocado, Tempura Crumb, Eel Sauce & Yum Yum Sauce and the Grand Canyon, Spicy Crab, Spicy Scallop, Avocado topped with Spicy Tuna, Salmon, Jalapeno with Yum Yum Sauce & Garlic Ponzu.

Definitely try and sit at the counter if you are eating sushi. You will get to interact with the sushi chefs and the owner. They are very friendly. We ordered the chu-toro sashimi and it was very fresh. Their oyster was also delicious. It looks like they have special deals on oysters on Tuesdays, so if you love oysters, check this place out on Tuesdays. If you are looking for cooked food, you can also try their hamachi-kama, which was also huge and nicely cooked. They also have yakiniku (Japanese BBQ) which was affordable and delicious.  For dessert, they gave us pocky snacks on the house.  We had such a great time here, and will be returning!",

The serving size is far from being able to satisfy 2 people, honestly. Even the waiter didn't hesitate to say \"you guys can finish it, no problem.\" But maybe the quality is good? Not really. The tuna had a watery taste and poor texture. The uni was far from fresh. Even the little spoonful of scallions on the side was not fresh. It was obviously cut earlier in the day (or even the day before) and kept in the refrigerator because the scallions were dehydrated horrendously. The only good part of the platter was the seared scallops and the squid wrapped salmon.  Would definitely not waste my time and money here again. Considering how much other food options are in the area, this one is far from worth your while.",

    "text": "I want to give this place a 4 star review but this is based solely off of what I got.  I got the 2 roll combo platter which comes with edamame, two specialty rolls, unlimited miso soup, salad, and dessert (scoop of ice cream) for $22 which honestly isn't a bad price for what you get, especially since each specialty roll is about $15.  That being said, maybe I just chose the wrong rolls.  I got the Kind Club roll which was good but boring honestly.  I also got the Steak Roll which was way too heavily sauced (with spicy mayo) and that just overpowered everything else on it.  The miso soup and the salad were quite tasty and the ice cream wasn't bad but I just wish I had a choice of some of their other dessert items.  I will say the rolls were very large, nice to look at, an dwell constructed.    The restaurant itself is nice looking, especially the wine barrel booths.  All of the servers were super nice and attentive.  I will say it is very expensive if you don't get one of  the combo plates.  Their AYCE option is $80 although that does include options that are not included in normal AYCE establishments.  I may try this place again and get different items but probably not for a while.",

    "text": "If you are looking for an AYCE sushi place... keep looking further! Sorry, but this probably won't be the place for AYCE tonight. However, if you're looking for something different *and* Japanese, then you've found the right place.   Sushi Takashi's AYCE prices are outrageous (I called to ask and it was somewhere like $70-80!) No way, Jose! But fortunately, they do offer a 10 and 12 course meal for a more reasonable price ($29.95 and $39.95 respectively). Perhaps that is why... to steer people away from AYCE!  Anyhow, my dad and I ordered the 12 course meal which was maybe a little much... we had to take a few items home. We could have done with the 10 course meal, but both of us were starving and underestimated the amount of food we could eat. Nonetheless, you do get a big bang for your buck. The food came out at a very consistent pace, though slightly out of order at times. Our server was also very helpful.  Let's began with the food itself, shall we...  Course #1: Edamame (Original / Garlic) My dad and I ordered two different edamame. I much prefer the garlic flavored one over the original. However, the garlic flavor was quite strong so it may not be your cup of tea if you are looking for a subtle start.  Course #2: Carpaccio (Beef / Salmon) Both were good but I much prefer the beef carpaccio.   Course #3: Soba Salad (Grilled Salmon / Grilled Shrimp) My dad and I ordered the same thing, different topping. This was one of my favorite dishes -- if not THE one favorite dish -- and I would've ordered more of this if I could. Delicious! Hands down, get the grilled salmon. Grilled shrimp was mediocre, and I'm a shrimp lover.  Course #4: Sushi (4pc nigiri) Nigiri was pretty good. Nothing spectacular and it wasn't the highlight of my meal, but you can tell it wasn't yucky old fish. The sashimi pieces were smooth.  Course #5: Cold Dish (Oyster / Snow Crab) Both were good! If I had to choose one, I'd probably choose the oysters.  Course #6: Vegetable (Agedashi-Tofu / Sauteed Asparagus) Tofu tasted old or like it's been sitting out and warmed up. Would definitely prefer the asparagus.  Course #7: Teriyaki (Chicken / Beef) The beef teriyaki was very dry and tasted a little overcooked, but was flavored so well. The chicken was perfect in every way. I love beef teriyaki normally but this time around I prefer the chicken.  Course #8: Deep fry (Karaage / Tempura) I don't like deep fried dishes as an overall personal preference... but the karaage was pretty good. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, which says a lot since I don't like deep fried dishes!  Course #9: Beef Dish (Sukiyaki) So good! A little on the sweeter side than some other place's sukiyaki, but still good. This was actually a lot more food than the previous courses, so I ended up taking this home for next day's lunch. Still good!  Course #10: Special Roll 4pc You have a choice of ordering one roll from the \"Special Rolls\" section. I ordered the yokohama and it was decent. I preferred the one my dad ordered, which was the steak roll.  Course #11: Soup (Corn & Egg Soup / Miso) Loved the corn and egg soup and the miso soup was made really well, too.  Course #12: Dessert (Tempura Ice Cream / Shaved Ice) I absolutely LOVED the tempura ice cream... I would've ordered more if I wasn't already in a food coma by this time. I'm a huge fan of tempura ice cream but for some reason the one here was really the cherry on top of my 12-course meal.",

Atmosphere - cozy. Felt like a True Izakaya in Japan.   Drink - we only did Sake but their list has a good number of options. I do however wish they had more large sake bottles.   Food - first of all, the menu has pictures of everything so that can be very helpful for some. I am not a fan of rolls so I can't comment on them. However the sashimi and sushi are very fresh and of high quality. Cooked dishes were also done very well. Chicken Karrage was very good. Grilled Whole squid was also very nice.  They also have good higher end fish cuts like Yellow Tail belly, Salmon Belly and Fatty Tuna. It should be noted that I did also appreciate the cut. It's not a sliver or slab but the right proportion to taste the fish and not feel cheated that you are not getting enough. Oh I should also note that they have fresh wasabi.   Price - excellent value. Small boat of sashimi, edamame, Chicken Karrage, grilled squid, fried Tofu, 2 orders of halibut sushi, 2 orders of eel sushi. 2 orders of yellowtail belly sushi, 4 orders of salmon belly, 5 orders of fatty tuna and 3 bottles of sake. With tax and a 23%tip the total for the dinner was $374.  Given the amount of high end fish that we ate this is a very good price. I've seen prices on the store for the fatty tuna at over $30 per order.",

I know people out there who love to give bad reviews because a place is \"expensive\" - stay away!  Depending on what you're interested in (cooked entrees, sushi, everything), there's a set for you. For the average AYCE sushi goers, I'd recommend the Takashi's Bottomless Dinner for $23 which includes salad, carpaccio or sashimi, miso soup, cooked entree and a roll. They also have 10-course dinner set and a 12-course dinner set.  But what I always come here for is the Salmon Overflow Bowl. For $30 you get salad, miso soup and lots of salmon sashimi (there's rice underneath all the salmon). If you're a big fan of salmon like I am, this is worth it. I normally get seconds because it is a lot of salmon.   They have different rolls and nigiri and other items you can order ala carte. The fish is always fresh and the cuts are good.",

    "text": "Yummy in my tummy when in Vegaaaaa!  Their seating booth area is shaped as half wine barrels - pretty neat!  Service was attentive and nice!  Food for happy hours was happening!  I love their salmon sashimi carpaccio.  The vinegar sauce with the smooth textured salmon, was delicious.  Do order up.  Also, the sprinkled salt asparagus, was swell and crisp to my liking.  Eat it if you need some veggie in your dietary system.   They have a lot of variety on their menu to choose from.  I like the raw oysters.  It was refreshing for the hot weather Vegas - if you go during the summer heat.  Bathrooms were a change of theme.  Instead of a standard or Japanese styled themed restroom, it was French themed with classical music played in the background.  Interesting.   I got my sashimi sushi game on here and enjoyed the restaurant entirely.",

Even then it was too late cause we were done with dinner! They didn't give us any water refills and had ran out of lemonade when i ordered one when i first arrived there! Then when my friend ordered an Arnold palmer, they couldnt make her one cause they didn't have lemonade!!! Smh! If you want awesome good sushi go here but don't expect awesome customer service for your first time, or maybe it was just one of those nights! Disappointed on service , loved the food! To their credit they offered to upgrade our desserts to shaved ice and ice cream when they realized they forgot soup and salad! Way toooo late though!",

I won't go into detail about each course except to say that every course was perfect. This is a lot of food, these courses are not tiny samples, they are small plates and around course 6 and 7 you start feeling it. I will recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas, such a tremendous value and such incredible food. I have noticed some yelpers complaining about the time it takes......IT'S 12 COURSES, you don't get them all at once, that would be dumb. Allocate 2-3 hours to enjoy this feast, and then you too can write witty 5 star comments on Yelp.",

    "text": "After an 8-hour drive from the Bay Area, we were ecstatic to have a decent meal. After checking in to our hotel room at 8pm we decided to head out for a japanese dinner outside the Vegas strip. With the help of Yelp reviews, I chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived at the restaurant at around 9pm. All the barrel looking booths were occupied, so we were led to a table close to the sushi bar. Good move! I read about their 10 or 12 course meal but we were not ready to be stuck with those choices. We decided to explore the menu. We ordered the following: 1. Sashimi plate for 4 - all the fish varieties were delicious. These were the super white tuna, halibut, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, mackarel, squid, octopus. I particularly loved the super white tuna, yellowtail & salmon. My friend loved the mackarel. 2. Hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar) - big portion. It was grilled to perfection. Melted in my mouth 3. Blue diamond - very good sushi. I love sushi without any mayo or sauces added to it because it does not cover up the taste of the fresh fish 4. Large Tree - this sushi had mayo & eel sauce but since I am bot a fan of all these stuff added on top of the sushi, our awesome waiter suggested that they could place the sauces on the side. Good call.  The softshell crab in this sushi was so delicate. It was crispy on the outside & juicy on the inside. With a little dab of the sauces, it enhanced the flavor of the sushi While we were indulging on the great food, Chef Takashi sent a plate of sauteed chinese broccoli & individual soup bowls of pumpkin soup for free. They were so good! The vegetable was great with our hamachi kama. The soup was light but delicious & the pumpkin pieces was cooked perfectly & it added the sweetness to the soup. 5 Tempura Ice Cream - to top off the food extravaganza, we had this wonderful dessert. The blend of the vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, whipped cream & the crunchiness of the tempura batter was divine  Thank you for a wonderful experience, Chef Takashi. It was great chatting with you as well. Til our next adventure to Las Vegas!",

Great food and restaurant.  Rolls are small because he's not trying to fill you up with rice.  Ponzu sauces doesn't drown your rolls; just the perfect amount for flavor.  Just little mindful things like that is why we love it that he's got his own place. The carpaccio garlic sauces are awesome.  Oysters were fresh and I tried the \"steak roll\" and loved it.   Next time we will give his semi fixed menu a try.",

    "text": "So on our last visit to Vegas, we had Hachi, Mizumi and Sushi Takashi on our to-try list.  The only reason I can't give Sushi Takashi 5-stars is that it took over two hours for the 12-course dinner. Matter of fact, we didn't even stick around for the dessert course because the husband got antsy about having been at the restaurant for so long. Bummer because I was looking forward to the tempura ice cream.  The food was great. Can't remember everything I chose, but everything tasted great. No complaint at all. Husband enjoyed his dinner as well. He got one of the dinner combos with chicken teriyaki and a half-roll of the tonkatsu roll, because for 2 people, if one orders the course dinner, the other person has to order something at least $15, which was fine, as we planned on sharing everything.  We do plan on returning, but not for the 12-course meal. Maybe a la carte or one of their other combo meals.  Oh, it's located in the same strip mall as Rincon de Buenos Aires. They face each other at opposite ends of the parking lot.",

I was sitting at the bar and found out both chefs are Japanese with total of half century experience.  I was well taken cared by the owner chef Nakamura San.  The set course is a must have.  It consist of varieties of baked, steamed, raw, grilled, fried traditional Japanese dishes. I highly recommend the oyster, uni, and seasonal fresh fish that chef recommends.  The price is reasonable as they only opened for a month and half.  I'm sure pretty soon there will be a line waiting at the door.  Thumbs up with five stars!",

I tried the tuna poke and the salmon avocado salad as well. The chef also sent a special roll with salmon on top, complimentary. The food was delicious. The salmon nigiri was mostly belly which surprised me because it wasn't in the description. It was bland but the smokiness and sauce made it still good though. Also had hot tea and plum mochi. At about 2am, I woke up with some awful stomach cramps and tried to take some pain medicine to go back to sleep. I then felt the sudden need to vomit. Today I've had all the symptoms of the stomach flu or food poisoning. This is my second time eating here. Unfortunately because of this incident, I will not be going back.",

The music is nice and the booth is comfy and spacious. This would be also be a great place to bring a date.  They have many different types of sushi packages and AYCE is $79, pricey for me but I'm sure it would be outstanding.  We had the signature rolls: Large Tree, Nagoya and Narita. They were fresh and right amount of rice. Sushi was of high quality and melts in your mouth.  I  wanted to get the 10 course meal too but will next time for sure.   The service was good, but the sushi took a while. Hence, the 4 star rating, not 5.  Highly recommend this place!",

Jay and his staff makes the dining experience a memorable one. No frills, just straight up good Japanese food for a great value. The $10 Uber ride  from the strip makes it worth while to come and eat here and get away from the overpriced spots on the strip.  This is a go to spot every time we come down to LV.

We dined on a Saturday night and I started swooning over how cute the seating was - each booth was a giant barrel! Once we settled in, I started noticing that each song that was played almost sounded like it was from my personal spotify playlist - I just felt like it was love at first sight. When our server came, she mentioned that it was happy hour - how could this visit be any more perfect...  We didn't want a heavy meal so we decided to get a few dishes off happy hour and some off their regular menu as well. Our favorites were the tuna carpaccio, oysters, and the hamachi kama.   Our experience was pretty much set up to be a good one, all the conditions were right, the food was delicious. By the end of the meal, I was like \"is this restaurant human and can I marry you.\" Can't wait to come back to try the multiple course menus!",

Once seated it took a bit for them to attend to us and take our refreshment order but that gave us time to look over the Menu.

    "text": "Disclaimer: We came very late before closing on a Friday night so perhaps we need to try it again (though there are many options in Vegas so we probably won't). We ordered the pre-set nigiri for two and many of the nigiri did not taste fresh and the rice was cold instead of warm like it should be. They also gave us a lot of fish of poor quality that seemed like they just slapped on there to fill the plate up. The unagi was probably the only piece of the 16 or so that we enjoyed. The ikura was too salty and the salmon was bland. We also ordered a salmon salad off the happy hour menu which we expected to be like a seaweed or something fresh but it was literally raw tasteless salmon with Romaine lettuce with avocado heavy Caesar dressing - not impressed at all. The only highlight to this meal is they gave us free house soup and a mochi ice cream to split on the house. But after spending $80 already for sushi that was lower quality than a sushi buffet or AYCE place, we were not pleased at all.",

We did the typical appetizer list: karagge, tempura, and oshinko. It was all so good. I can't even describe how yummy everything on the starters were ! Then the nigiri and sashimi was the best I've had in Vegas. I've been here ten years and this is the first time I had fish and sushi rice as good as it was when we were in Japan. I'm so thankful to have this restaurant to now call our home. You have to try it. Forget reading. Go!",

Wish the quantity had been reduced and quality increased. We felt rushed as courses were served on top of each other, definitely did not take the 3 hours other had referenced. Quality of the fish was fine, I'd give a 4 star if that's all I was reviewing based on.",

So he got the salmon sashimi rice bowl (17.95) and he loved it.  He thought the salmon sashimi was very very fresh and delicious.  Although it seems expensive for a bowl, they actually gave quite a bit of sashimi, 15 thin pieces.  It also came with salad and miso soup.    I got the beef sukiyaki ($15.45) and it was very delicious too, full of beef, tofu, and vegetables.  I like that they really pay attention to details, be it bringing the right amount of extra bowls without us asking, avocado on the house salad, lids on miso soup and hotpot.

    "text": "Admittedly, I'm wary whenever the word \"bargain\" is used as a descriptor for food, but after trying this place out, Sushi Takashi gets a pass from me on that matter. The menu is nothing short of overwhelming, so I ended up in the pitfall that is the 10 course meal along with the others in my party.   I was a fan of the signature rolls (shared among the table, particularly the Japanese Lasagna. Seeing doria on the yoshoku menu was a pleasant surprise (miss u saizeriya), and it soon disappeared once it reached the table. The unassuming kakigoori with sweetened condensed milk was refreshing and made for a good ending to our dinner. Along with the food, the servers here made our dining experience an enjoyable one, and I'm certain I'll come around again on an emptier stomach.",

I didn't have a reservation but they sat me immediately at the sushi bar. The fish displayed looked very fresh so was excited. I got the 10 course meal which the waiter recommended and it did not disappoint. I was so stuffed after the 10 courses. The fish was fresh and very high quality. The chef offered some service (free) items which were delicious. He was also very friendly and I am definitely repeating but I gotta make sure I come hungry.  The ambiance of the place is very nice if you are on a date. Bathrooms were very clean. Excellent service from waitstaff and they were very helpful in making my order and made sure my hot tea never went below half. Overall a great meal!",

    "text": "We stayed off the strip chose this place for the same reason. It was a quiet and peaceful drive there. This is near the street across from the corporate building for a gas company.   The owner has a lot of pride in his business. There is a timeline out front that outlines his career from an immigrant to a top chef on the strip to opening his own place.   We sat the sushi bar and I got a box with teriyaki salmon and beef. It came complete with miso soup and a little salad. My friends ordered lots of sushi and it all looked incredible. The highlight of the night was when the chef himself kicked back and conversed with us.  It was nice to actually meet the owner and have a quiet dinner without a long wait, noise, or disconnected service.   The decor was nice. Take a trip to the bathroom for classical music that is piped in. We did not get to dine in the booth area that looked like split open wine barrels but this was a good meal that lent to the memorability of my trip.",

    "text": "We came back on behalf on Mr. Kurosawa and had a much better experience. We set up a reservation for 7pm with Mrs. Robertson for Saturday night and were seated immediately upon arrival. Instead of attempting the 12-course meal again we decided to order a la carte for a new experience.   We ordered sashimi mostly (salmon, seared salmon, super white tuna), tuna poke bowls, and some small appetizers this time around. Everything showed up promptly and we were attended to consistently throughout the night. We also observed the other tables just to make sure we were not getting special treatment and the other tables around us (there were 3 with 4 people minimum each) happened to be getting the same level of attention and service. The food was delicious, as it was the last time we came. While waiting for our sushi roll head chef Takashi also personally sent us a delicious salmon soup for us to try and it was amazing. It was a soup will come back for next winter to try again because it reminded me of a soup my grandmother used to make me during the winter as a child.   The most important takeaway I had after the evening are that the people at Sushi Takashi truly care about their business and the experiences that their patrons are having on a nightly basis. While our first experience wasn't amazing they immediately sought out to correct it and through their efforts have earned more respect from me than if I had just a \"good\" or \"okay\" experience the first time around. I plan on visiting Sushi Takashi again in the future and I encourage others to do the same.",

My 4 different Carpaccio were very salty that I couldn't taste the fresh fish taste. On top of this, they charge me twice with one dinner, one with tip and the other one without tip. When I called them, they said they will take care of it, but they didn't take care of it right away. I had to contact them again a day later and I got the same answer. But I'm still waiting the refund and I'm ready to dispute this charge via my credit card. If they're on top of this, I didn't have to go thru credit card dispute process. Very disappointed!!!",

The only bad part was the couple behind me obviously never go out as the girl kept yelling out and singing obnoxiously loud. I left early than I wanted to because she was incredibly annoying.  It would have been nice if the staff could have asked the couple to quiet down and be considerate of the other patrons. But still the food was fantastic and the staff were friendly enough.
