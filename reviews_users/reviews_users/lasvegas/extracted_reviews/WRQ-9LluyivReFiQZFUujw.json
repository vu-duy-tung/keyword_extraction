    "text": "It's been a bookmark in my list (among a bunch of others) to make it out here and check out the buzz everyone's been making about this place, but the Summerlin area is never on my way to any place I have to go, but not so long ago, I was able to make it and meet the cool staff lounging out in the front of the store. I told them it was my first time there, and they pointed to the HUGE board that had their menu drawn on! Pretty cool to look at, but kind of unorganized. I like to look at pictures so I turned to the handy Yelp app to see what others ordered. I made my decision.  I went with the Bulgogi Dog and went for the overkill with the Angry Kimchi fries with sweet potato fries. The food took a little bit of time to come out, but, in my opinion, worth the wait and understandable when you see what comes out! My mouth and eyes literally opened wide (see picture posted)!  I did not expect the fries to be that HUGE of a serving and the Bulgogi Dog's presentation was very appetizing! I normally eat my fries first because there's something about cold fries that make them a little bit of a chore to eat. So, I dived right in! The egg on top was like a cherry so I popped the yolk and mixed it all up nice with the rest of the ingredients!   BOMB.COM/Amazing/Mouth-Watering.exe!  The dog in the Bulgogi Dog might've been all beef. In which case, was perfect! The natural casing and snap to it is perfect and bulgogi was the perfect topping! I love mixing my food together so this place was like a trip to my mind with a palette of American and Asian ingredients! A-OK in my book!  BUT, I still can't give it that 5-star... I liked the food, but didn't love it. I don't feel like the food is a craving because of it's complexity in it's menu. Sometimes, less is more. What's the Buldogi's staple? Like the Big Mac of McDonald's or the Whopper of Burger King. Buldogi's has to have that ONE THING! And I found the menu to be a bit messy. The environment and eating areas are nice and clean, but 4 stars is still better than 3... 2.... or 1! Thumbs up, Buldogi's! I'll come back someday...",

The pickled carrots and daikon could have used a little bit of sugar to balance the saltiness of the pork belly.  If they work on those flavored, I think they would have much better products.  The Angry Kimchee Fries were just okay too.",

The bulgogi beef on the hot dog however was kind of bland - only a couple of bites out of several had that great bulgogi marinade flavor. Maybe they weren't able to marinate this batch of bulgogi beef long enough, but in any case if the bulgogi flavor had been consistent throughout the beef on the hot dog this would have been an easy 5 stars.   We also had their regular seasoned french fries which were fine. The lady working the counter while we were there was super friendly and accommodating which made our visit to Buldogis a really great experience. We will be back to Buldogis to try some of the other items on their menu.",

You're definitely welcomed immediately by the employees as you walk into this small joint. I'm guessing the small amount of tables is adequate because I can see the turnover being pretty fast. There's a few tables/chairs outside also, perhaps better for after summer!  Crazy and creative menu. Look for yourself. It's a hot dog joint, where they offer just your usual ketchup, mustard, relish, but that's not why you come here. My last visit, I had a Banh Mi Dog. Your choice of all-beef, turkey, or veggie hot dog, topped with pork belly, banh mi slaw, herbs, and Asian Sriracha mayo. Like I said, crazy hot dogs!  I think I've finished my first hot dog, so I knew ordering one item to eat was enough for me. I'll have to come back with more people to try those Angry Fries people have been raving about.  If you're still not sold on the hot dogs, you can get any of their crazy toppings on a burger. They also have a couple of rice bowls to choose from, which I ordered for my son. Big portion! We took it home, and the leftovers gave him another meal or two.  They have a Yelp check-in special right now, which is 10% off your order.   I'm trying to decide which hot dog I'll be ordering next... :)",

    "text": "Hungry one late afternoon in Vegas, we decided to go off strip and try one of Minh's bookmarks that he had. Hot dogs sounded like they would totally hit the spot since i had been craving them for the past week!  Located in a large shopping center (it can be a bit tricky to find this place, as we were lost for a moment on the other side of the center). If you keep a look out for Chicago Brewing Company you are in the right spot my friend just look to your left err right and you will see it!  Walking up to Buldogis I noticed outside that they are pet friendly, a huge water bowl sat outside just waiting for the next thirsty doggy to come by.   As we entered, we were greeted by a friendly hello from the cashier, the menu is posted above the register, but they also have menus on the tables if you do not feel like standing in front of the register with an I-don't-know-what-to-have look on your face.  There is a lot to choose from and for a first timer like me, I was going back and forth with myself on what my final decision would be to order. I settled with getting:  Buckeye Dog- Pork belly bacon, Corn relish, Cheddar cheese, and Garlic Mayo. We also ordered small fries, which had Italian Herb Parmesan cheese, and other special spices that they kept a secret from us!  After we placed our order, we sat down and waited for our food to be prepared. The dining area is on the smaller side but cozy. Two large plasma TV on each side of the room were showing either Food Network or The Travel channel.   Our food was brought out to us by the cashier, it looked and smelled great. Let's dig in because I am hungry!  My Buckeye dog was huge; they piled on the topping and left no empty spaces between the hot dog and the super soft bun.  First intention was to just pick it up and bite into it as I usually do with a hot dog except I could not find a perfect spot to sink my teeth into. So I had to cut into that sucker with a knife and fork and eat it that way. The dog was juicy and not greasy at all. Warning if you are not careful half the toppings will either land on the table or in your lap, it's that messy!!  The small fries were enough for two people to share and came with ketchup to dip the fries into.  We left full and happy!    Great customer service Buldogis!!!!",

I come from the south so I rarely see the sign and finally made a point to pull in Saturday afternoon as a pre-movie snack.  Props to everyone working there for being super friendly.  Almost too friendly.  Since it was dogs, I sort of anticipated a chi-town or zoo-york 'tude but not so Joe.  They have a big chalk menu on the back wall but as you face the cute girl and the register there is a menu behind her.  Too much visual overload so I just ask for what is popular.  At 3pm, there are about 6 patrons eating in-house and I take that as a good sign for an off-time.  Based on the recommendation I opted for their Philly Cheese Steak hotdog, \"sweet fries\" and a Mt. Dew.  If you gonna do it, dew it!  Never had sweet fries or whatever they were called but I will probably just opt for chips next time.  Quickly I was served at my table with a great looking work of art hotdog. Certainly photo worthing and to quote a Seinfeldism...sponge worthy...whatever the hell that means.  I wolfed down the dog and was on my way.  Where I was sitting I did not see a garbage can so asked if I was to buss my own table.  No, we will they said but as I walked out I saw the garbage can and realized they just did me one.  Cool peeps.  I would highly recommend.",

After getting our food we headed home to pig out but outta no where I realized I had dropped my wallet somewhere !? I sorta freaked out thinking of the trouble of having to lose my IDs, cards, passes, money, etc. We pulled over to check the truck out to maybe see if I dropped it inside but there was no sign of it. A quick thought came to my head thinking maybe I have left it back at Buldogis. BUT!!! as soon I looked down at my screen to call the store, I've already had a message from the store manager saying he has found my wallet!!! I COULDNT BELIEVE IT ! No less then 10 minutes they found my wallet, found me on Facebook jus to let me know they have found it!! Truly AMAZINGGG! Seriously 1 of the greatest places of customer service ! A1 top of the charts!! Such a great place full of great people!!! Nothing but tons of RESPECT!! To even do such a thing truly amazing! You guys totally made my day!! Thank you to everyone there.!!

The variety of hot dogs and toppings at this place are unreal.  I tried the angry dog and the hawaiian dog - both dogs were loaded with toppings and fantastic.  I had the angry fries and they were very unusual but the flavor was outstanding.   The place is small, workers are friendly, prices are right, and you don't walk away hungry.  That's my type of place",

    "text": "it seems everyone's jumping on this asian fusion fast food bandwagon. from korean tacos to sushi burritos now korean hot dogs!!!??? i don't typically follow trends but, when it comes to food, trendy or not, if it's good food, i'm all over it! that definitely goes for buldogi's.  i have a difficult time giving a hot dog place 5 stars when they don't make their own dogs. (1/2 star deducted) i mean, really, how difficult is it to put yummy ingredients over a pre made dog? not all that difficult. and then, when you charge $5 per dog, well, maybe make your own dog from scratch, ya know!?  what we had:  banh mi dog (vegetarian) - essentially it's a tofu dog on a basic bun topped with banh mi slaw and sriracha mayo.  the sauce definitely makes the dog.  without it, it'd be quite tasteless and boring.  euro special fries - i'm not usually into fat fries but these are quite good. crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  again, the freakin garlic sauce makes this dish!  angry kimchi fries - ok, not great. beef bulgogi dog - the hubby inhaled it and mentioned that the bulgogi was less salty than komex. west coast dog - the hubby mentioned it was good but not great.  again, if the dog was scratch made, it would've made a huge difference.  one main issue i had with them was that i ordered the banh mi dog, vegetarian style, but didn't receive a vegetarian style dog. it even says on the menu that any dog can be made vegetarian. but when my dog arrived, there was pork belly all over the top of it. is it just me or when someone orders something vegetarian, isn't it assumed that the entire dish should be vegetarian? just sayin'... so, 1/2 star deducted.  overall, the homemade sauces and mayos are delicious and definitely make the dogs shine. it's all about those yummy sauces here. would love to see some different buns (sesame, potato, wheat, etc.) would love to see scratch made dogs, especially a lobster dog or something with seafood.  all that said, the concept is good, the food is tasty and the service is friendly. if you're into hot dogs, you definitely have to try buldogi's!!!",

    "text": "It's interesting that this gets put in \"Korean\" because there's just the actual business name and two of their hot dogs that are Korean-related. Overall, they have probably the most diverse and interesting menu of hot dogs I've ever seen. I can't resist gourmet hot dogs so, when this place came up on an area Yelp search, I couldn't not go. I got a bulgogi and a banh mi hot dog. Yeah... that banh mi. I've had bulgogi dogs before, and this was not the best I've had. I really enjoyed the banh mi though, which came with the shredded radishes and a spicy sauce, that did actually make it taste like its namesake. They had a few other \"specialty\" dogs that I only saw on the wall after I ordered, like a Santa Fe dog. So do look there first before you commit. The bulgogi fries were really tempting but seemed like way too much. If I went back, I would try them though. Dogs run about $4.50 each. Pricey for a Ballpark frank (they plump when you cook them because they're full of water and filler!) with relish from a packet, but not bad when you think about what you're actually getting. As they say on the menu, these are truly top-quality hot dogs too: all beef, all flavor. I think it would be even better if you could take your specialty dog into the 24-hour brewpub next door, since they don't serve gourmet hot dogs, and Buldogis does not serve alcohol.",

The only downfall was how some of our orders took HELLA time to get to us. Possibly because we came with a party of 12 and then another big group came. Although the server was nice, she was kinda messing up on the orders and giving ours to other people first before us. Most of our food did get to us but I don't want to knock down a star... I really could tell she was trying her best and there was two big groups of people. There shouldn't be any excuses. But hey, the food was good!  I choose to go with Naked Dog (where you get to dress it up with all kinds of fixings) and choose to add the Short Rib Bulgogi meet, banh mi slaw, fried eggand bulgogi mayo. Holla!!! The bread was sweet and delicious almost like a hawaiian sweet roll hot dog bun.   And those ANGRY KIMCHI FRIES, have mercy on me! Delicious. Weird though, cause I actually liked them as leftovers the day afterward too.  You gotta try this place. Seriously!",

You can get anything from bulgogi to their take on a Chicago dog for toppings, even as a vegetarian hot dog, if you prefer. My favorite here is the west coast dog, topped with grilled onions, cheese, and seriously, the most delicious avocado mayo. I prefer a real Chicago dog to their version, but maybe they felt the need to switch it up because they are next door to Chicago Brewing Co.",

    "text": "My friend and I came in for an early dinner before going to the movies. We drove around and kept missing it, but after a closer look at Google Maps, it is tucked away between Chicago Brewing Company and Jack in the Box.  As soon as you walk in, there is a slew of employees ready to greet you. We were told to have a seat and look at the menu before going up to the counter to order. Aziz B. does not eat pork and I was becoming concerned because everything I was looking at had some kind of pig product. Turns out that my eyes tend to wander towards this beast, because he was able to find choices just fine.   When Buldogis gets it right, they get it really right. Aziz B. was impressed with both his Chili and Bulgogi Dogs. Two of these large creations was enough to stuff him to the point where he barely touched our large fries. I had ordered two dogs as well. I found the hot dogs to be very flavorful, but borderline salty. The Banh Mi Dog was great in concept, but ended up not being my standout favorite. The pickled veggies did not have the sweet and tart bite that I love in a Vietnamese sandwich. The regular bun also detracts because an expected crunch is the best part about a Viet sub. The pickle juice also made the bun go soggy. It was a brilliant idea to reconstruct that texture with the crispy bacon, but then both meats just overpower the rest of the ingredients. I also wished that they used fresh cilantro instead of the dried stuff. Maybe this is why my friends don't go with me to Vietnamese places... Now on to why I give Buldogi 4 stars. The Angry Dog was everything I was hoping for. As the one I first ate, I hit my zenith early. The Asian slaw had a light sesame taste without over killing the harmony. The jalapenos and spicy mayo added the perfect amount of heat. The spicy pork on top was tender and plentiful. At first $4.95 for a hot dog might seem like a lot, but they pile the condiments on high. These are not skimpy portions. Two dogs teetered on the line of gluttony for me. Unlike my friend, I finish our fries($2.25).   Now that I have tried their hot dogs, I want to come back for their rice bowls. It is beneficial to take a look at their specials wall. It is not on the menu, but hard to miss.",

Restaurant was empty when we were there. people are friendly that's why its two star not one!",

    "text": "Bulgogi literally means, \"Fire Meat\" - Buldogi, literally means, \"Hot Weiner\"  I don't think there's any place in Vegas that serves this style of hot dog and french fries. Come here with an open mind and an empty belly, because this place is definitely worth the calories.   When you first walk in the smell is intoxicating; grilled meats, french fries and Kimchi, a great foreshadowing of an amazing lunch. After perusing the menu, I finally made up my mind and went with the Bulgogoi Dog.   This is a hot dog covered in Bulgogi cooked meat, Asian slaw, green onions, sesame seeds and Bulgogi mayo. Amazing flavor combinations with each bite, the crunchy slaw mixed with soft bun and charred meat is a pure food party in your mouth. The seared meat on top is super tender and surprisingly goes well with the all beef hot dog.   I also ordered the Kimchi Fries. Normally I'm not a Kimchi fan, but Buldogi has made a believer out me. Sweet potato fries, with spiced pork bulgogi, layers of cheese and Kimchi plus jalapenos and a fried egg! Why a fried egg? Just because!   Come. Sit. Stay. Good Buldogi.",

I ordered the carne asada fries and a fountain drink. It came out piping hot which was good but the fountain drink tasted a little flat beforehand. The fries were crispy and hot BUT flavor wise it was idk eh .... It's exactly what you would expect and nothing I guess special about it, there wasn't enough cheese and the sauce over kills the flavor of the bulgogi. The bulgogi was not tender at all so it killed the vibe of everything. I've had bulgogi fries from the dragon grille food truck and that one is forsure the BEST but this didn't cut it for me. My friend got the bulgogi hot dog and he said it's a 7-1/2 out of 10. This place has great service but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place unless you're in the area. Stick to your local Roberto's asada fries wouldn't really make a huge difference.",

I understand that we requested the bacon to be on the side, but didn't expect them to not add the sauce either. Too bad we didn't check the orders we received before leaving the restaurant.

I don't usually seek out hot dogs or eat them very often, so you might ask what's the big deal?  These aren't just hot dogs:  these are delicious, high quality dogs all by themselves, but you're not going to just have a hot dog.  Instead, you'll have the folks behind the counter pile your choice of a great assortment of Korean, Mexican or traditional US toppings onto the dog and make it a work of art.  I've tried the Angry Dog (spicy!) and the Smoked Dog so far--both delicious.  Remember, you can also treat your fries like you treat your dog:  get 'em plain or dress them up.  The place is super casual, the service was fast and very friendly, there's plenty of parking, and the restaurant is easy to find even though it's not sitting right on the road.  Be warned:  you're going to be very full.  With a dog, fries and something to drink for lunch, I didn't  have a problem skipping dinner.  That was okay though; I was all happy inside.  I'm ready to go again!",

The service was friendly and quick and we had our food in no time. The food looked so pretty, it made for a perfect picture opportunity.  My dog was good, nothing to write home about, but it was decent and I enjoyed the toppings more than the actual hot dog since it got a little wrinkly and shriveled after the cooking process. The fries were well cooked. I have a feeling I might enjoy plain fries more if I were to come back, instead of the ones with all the toppings. The fries themselves were perfectly cooked and while I enjoyed all the toppings, including the nicely cooked egg, I found myself picking out the plain fries to enjoy by themselves.  Overall, I enjoyed our meal, but I don't think I'd make this a regular stop on my foodventures.",

    "text": "The Dragon Kimchi Dog Challenge called.  LJ R. and Niyen answered the phone.  On your left, the Yelp community is represented by LJ R. and Niyen.  They're up for the challenge.  Niyen is jumping up and down, taking off his hat, shaking his head, psyching up, throwing punches in the air, drumming up the crowd in the style of Muhamed Ali.  He's pawing at the floor, ready to tear into the three habenero laden dogs.  Then there is LJ.  Quiet, steady, silent, deadly.  LJ assumes the position, without fanfare, without bravado.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.  But first our competitors must sign the two page waiver which the short version says if they keel over we have to drag them to the nearest medical facility and clean up after ourselves.  On the right, the Dragon Kimchi Dog looms.  Three loaded dogs with hotter than hell sauce (according to the taste tester, Kevin P.), kimchi and habeneros.  Those dogs gotta disappear in 5 minutes or your heartburn is for nothing.  The owner states the rules, turns on the floodlights over the action scene and begins the timer.    Challenger Niyen has a distinct strategy.  He pulls the dogs out of their nest and downs them one by one.  Then he assaults the bun, kimchi and toppings.  LJ is methodical with the traditional approach, the shortest point between two distances is a straight line.  Our brand new Community Yelp Manager, Drew is on pins and needles since this is the first challenge on his watch.  The 8 Yelpers who came to show support are giving out times and encouragement.  The tension is thick in the air like kimchi.  Ten, nine, eight, seven.....come on LJ!  Oh time is up!  One Dragon bite stood between LJ and Buldogi Glory.  Oh the agony of defeat.    But all is not lost.  Both Niyen and LJ were given Buldogi shirts by the owner that we all signed our wishes on it.  To be continued......",

I tried the banh mi hot dog and I only took two bites. I couldn't finish it. Idk, I wasn't too big of a fan. We also ordered a few of their special fries. I forgot what they were called, but one had kimchi in it and the other had pork belly in it. I really liked the pork belly fries. The pork belly wasn't too old and had the perfect crunch on it.   In addition to all this, it was my first time in Vegas and I was excited to try all the different food there. Unfortunately, this one wasn't on my top list. Maybe next time.",

Budogis' menu hasn't just grown, but evolved. It began as Korean fusion gourmet hotdogs. It's now a fusion restaurant with hotdogs, burgers, fries, soups, rice bowls and more. There's been a new limited time item everytime I've stopped by that never fails to disappoint.   Flavor is excellent. Portions are more than ample. And service... it's not just a smile, it's True hospitality. I can't recommend this eatery enough.",

I had the Hawaiian Dog which came with pineapple salsa, onions and honey Dijon mustard. It was good but my low tolerance for salt ruined it for me. I also tried the Euro Special fries which I didn't expect to be so big . It is comparable in size to Carne Asada Fries at Robertos. . The fries had bacon , herbs, Parmesan cheese and garlic mayo. This was again too salty for me. I didn't want to give up on Buldogis though...I wanted to give them another try.   The second time around I ordered the Angry Dog but on a vegetarian dog. The girl taking my order wanted me to know this dog had Pork Bulgogi as one of the toppings. I told her I didn't mind. She was probably wondering why a vegetarian would want pork on their hot dog. I ordered the vegetarian dog in the hopes it would be less salty then their beef dog and I was right! The flavor was perfect! It still had the taste of a normal hot dog. My dog also had Asian slaw, jalapenos, and fiery sauce. It was delicious! They also threw in a second dog for free because they accidentally made the first one wrong. I thought that was nice since I was extra hungry. I also had a side of their classic Buldogis fries which was not as salty as their Euro Fries. I ended up eating one and a half hot dogs . I was so full but satisfied !",

One of the few place. That has great original hot dog fusion concepts. Do yourself a favor and get the Angry Dog. Trust me you'll thank me later.

I have tried both the Chicago dog and the Hawaiian. In addition to those, I've also bought Carne Asada fries. Everything was good, but it wasn't necessarily great. I have never managed to finish an entire hot dog because they seem overly greasy. I hate feeling like I am inhaling something that's not necessarily good for my body.  If they could some how make these items a cleaner eat, I might not feel so bad. My hands get drenched in sauce and hotdog juice. The carne asada fries are spectacular, but they are also just as good as the ones that I received from a trip from the dreadful Roberto's taco shop lol.  The food is good, but if you are like me, you can only handle so much.",

    "text": "Ok I'm never doubting Buldogis again. Haven't had them since last year, at their other location which according to Yelp is closed, and I wasn't impressed back then.  Upon arriving I made it my main priority to finally trying one of their dogs NOT their other items. Once inside I saw the words \"new\" and \"pork belly\".  I was about this much with not getting the dog again but of course I went with the Angry Dog so I'll save that new pork belly dish for another day. Anything with a mayo based sauce is instantly awesome in my book, that's my thing. I like making my own mayo based sauces at home and use them with everything and its almost always spicy too similar to this one.  The Angry Dog was the best thing I've eaten from a restaurant in a long time so \"Angry Dog FTW!!!\" <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buldogis-gourmet-hot-dogs-las-vegas?select=4X_JwTZ_F2rcpB8VEeGn-g#4X_JwTZ_F2rcpB8VEeGn-g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/buld...</a>  Besides the mayo the Angry Dog had a nicer quality hot dog, some jalapenos which made added more spiciness, a little Asian slaw which kind of didn't notice, and some bulgogi meat which really did nothing for me.  Not gonna lie I think I could make my own version of a dog worthy of the menu loaded with much more but still Buldogis dogs are still pretty awesome. Anthony F. picked up the bulgogi burger and angry fries with a delicious looking fried egg on it MAN I wished I had ordered that too.   For you food challengers they have a challenge for you. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buldogis-gourmet-hot-dogs-las-vegas?select=V2UW0waqjwfcEadiyoNQRQ#V2UW0waqjwfcEadiyoNQRQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/buld...</a> The Dragon Kimchi Dog Challenge.  I don't know much about it other then there's pork belly, kimchi, caramelized onions, sport pepper, dragon sauce, there's 5 pepper symbols next to it on their board so it has to be hot, and I'm sure it comes with a hot dog and bun. I want to do the challenge but I just don't know more details. Does anyone else wanna?   They have a lot more items than just hotdogs and what you seen on their regular menu, there's also burgers and more.  I always enjoy it when chefs keep creating and adding dishes to their already awesome menus.",

It included the patty, pork belly bacon, kimchi, lettuce, and I added cheese. I say this burger was worth the money spent because it was delicious. Everything blended together well especially with the euro fries. The euro fries were $6 and they were topped with garlic mayonnaise and pork belly bacon. The fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Again, it was awesome.   The two guys working were very friendly. I forgot to use my 10% discount so one of them gave me a free soda!

We loved the service, the girl at the counter was very friendly and came over to our table twice to ask how we were doing and to clean up our plates. I really didn't expect that at all since I thought it was a fast food place, but yay for service :D Also they didn't have something on the menu my friend wanted to order, and they were so apologetic for it even though we didn't think it was a big deal. They even offered to give it to us for free if we came back later for dinner or tomorrow. Seriously, it was awesome! Even places that charge $$$$ don't give me this type of service.  Anyhow, onto the food. If you love hot dogs, I think you will love this place. I really liked my banh mi hot dog and my friend loved his smoked dog. They were huge and satisfying, we both left full. We also ordered the angry fries, which comes in a very big portion. We didn't finish it, but it was pretty good. We both thought there was too much going on with it though and that maybe it would be better if it was with regular fries instead of sweet potato fries (although I love sweet potato fries by itself). Give this place a try and see for yourself. :)",

I'd suggest use a hot link, add some cilantro (mine had just mild cabbage as the slaw) use the Korean toasty tasty sesame oil (dark caramel brown oil, ooh) and minced spicy jalapeno to the slaw, spicier pork, and more siracha to flame it up. The chopped jalapeno on mine had zero kick, like munching a crunchy mild green pepper (it was fresh, which is good). Love the creativity on the menu though, headed straight here from the airport. Maybe I was expecting too much. I thought the Angry Dog I got was actually called a Happy Puppy.  It's good, just not spicy hot like the name suggests.",

I asked for a hot dog with cheese for my 10 year-old daughter because she hasn't cultivated a sophisticated palate yet.  I love my chili dog.  Personally, I would have liked more spice in the chili, but it was substantial.  The dog inside was good and made of natural beef.  Buldogis would have earned five stars from me, but they guys weren't very helpful with me when ordering for my daughter.  After asking for a simple hot dog with some cheese, they gave her a hot dog with relish, mustard, ketchup (none of which she will eat,) and no cheese.  We scraped off all the condiments, but she wan't too into the dog at that point.  It was a simple mistake, but one that I had to pay for.",

So I switched to a vegetarian style with kimchi and a fried egg...  He kept barking at me \"anything else?? anything else??\" ... even if I was thinking about getting something else, I didn't want to after being barked at like that. Hung up, got there only to feel rushed AGAIN when there were two people already seated and being fed, and one other guy who had already ordered before me. (Whom, he seemed considerably friendlier to). \"Pick up order?\" \"Yes, veggie dog\". I paid, and even tipped, and while I'm grappling to get my wallet, phone, and food together, he's saying thank you have a nice day--twice--as though I need to move faster... Uhm... OK.  For $6 I can handle crappy service. I got home, and when I opened my container, I was dismayed to see a hot dog in my \"veggie\" dog... In hindsight he must have heard \"naked\" instead of \"veggie\", because the only thing on it was kimchi and a fried egg. WELL, maybe you shouldn't be so rushed, especially with 3 customers in your vicinity. I try not to eat meat more than once a month so this was really a let down... but, not wanting to be \"that customer\" i ate it anyway.   The ONLY reason I'm even giving it 2 stars is because, for what the dog was, it was really good. The kimchi was on point, and the egg was perfect. However, I like to eat what I ordered. And not be treated like shit in the process.   I'll give this place one more try. Maybe next time I'll come in and order.",

Our order taker was new so there were a few hiccups but I'm not going to fault him for being new.   He was so courteous and friendly.   The food was ok.   Maybe I was expecting deeper richer flavors?   The bulgogi didn't seem seasoned enough and the garlic aioli didn't taste nice.  But the hot dog itself was absolutely delicious.   The angry burrito was also a little lacking in spice and flavor.  I'm going to definitely try this place again and order different items because maybe it just wasn't my day.   We'll see....",

Flavor balance is a key here - where there is a pile of fatty pork belly, there is a layer of spicy and acidic kimchi to match. The dogs themselves have a great bite, and nice flavor - nothing crazy, though. These dogs are just as much novelties as they are legitimate culinary creations, but they'll indisputably surpass the most epic, indulgent, maniacally constructed hot dogs you may ever come across.",

I ordered take out and the food was ready within 30 minutes.   The banh mi hot dog was really good. It was topped with large chunks of bacon, pickled daikon/carrots, and Sriracha aioli. It was slightly salty for me (most likely from the bacon) but was balanced out by the pickled daikon/carrots and bun.   The carne asada fries was topped with beef bulgogi, caramelized onions, pico de Gallo, 4 cheese, jalapenos, chipotle aioli and avocado aioli. It was really good. It did not lack flavor at all. The bulgogi gave the dish a slight sweetness/saltiness to it and the jalapenos gave it the perfect amount of little heat.   My husband ordered Mac n cheese hot dog with pork belly on top. Unfortunately when we got home, the pork belly was no where to be found. He left a yelp review in regards to it and I received the call (I ordered the food via yelp) from the owner/manager within minutes of him posting it. They resolved the issue right away. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!   My friend ordered the bulgogi hot dog and she loved it. She usually eats like a bird and she ended up devouring the hot dog. Lol.   Definitely recommend this place especially if you want to try something different!",

They make their own sauces one of them being the dragon sauce.  It's not for the weak or even strong willed, it's crazy spicy, but good.  A little goes a long way, I would t challenge them with anymore than that.  The bahn mi is sooo good and the Mac n cheese is to die for.  I know I'm hyping this place, but honestly it's worth trying.  Especially in cold weather when you're trying to accomplish warm belly",

We ordered the Gangnam and the Angry Kimchi hot dogs, a plain cheese quesadilla (for the kiddo), Euro fries, and 2 fountain drinks totaling just under $42.   The Gangnam had pork belly, cucumbers, furikake, and a Korean chili sauce. Everything was pretty flavorless. Just an overwhelming saltiness from the actual hot dog. The BF had the Angry Kimchi and I took a bite. Definitely spicy and the kimchi was pretty good. Euro fries had a garlic mayo that, at first, was delicious but after a few bites became overpowering. Cheese quesadilla was a cheese quesadilla (no complaints from my kid).   Overall, it was just fair. Maybe I'll come back again someday and try something else.",

Jalepenos were fresh, crunchy and the spiciest part. Bulgogi reminded me of teriyaki beef. The fiery aioli was mild at best.  West coast- The dog was tasty. Cheddar was melty. Pico de gallo was crisp and tasted fresh. I didnt get onions. The avocado aioli was like green mayo.  Chili cheese- dog was tasty. The bun was extremely soggy. Chili was very bland, texture wise was like beef was cooked but fat was not drained and then was blended with water and generic chili powder. Was not a fan of the green onions. The cheddar was melty. Only ate half of it, couldn't finish it.  Chili cheese fries- fries were like 3/4 the thickness of steak fries. Chili was same chili on chili dog. Cheese was melty, but green onions were a bit much .   The mac n cheese quesadillas stayed together well but there was no flavor besides the bacon which was thick and crunchy.  All in all we were underwhelmed. Glad we tried it but won't be back.",

    "text": "Fusion is such a fun concept! You get a few of your fave things together and it's like tastebuds dream come True. After dropping the toddler to his class, the hubs decided to make a quick drive to buldogis. Initially, he felt like heading to another hotdog establishment that was just a walk away from the toddler's class...but rarely does the idea of eating hotdogs for lunch is a thought in this family. If we are gonna go in might as well go all out...cheat day has arrived!  We enter around 130 and I was glad to see it empty with the exception of 1 other customer who we followed in. I kinda knew what I wanted to try, and it was a matter of rushing the husband to get his life together so we can order. He was too busy staring at the hangover soup. No, stop staring at the soup...you aren't hungover...and we came for weiners..so pick which weiner you are going to shove into your mouth! Pastrami? Finally. Okay, so husband opts for pastrami as he still stares at the hangover soup. Which btw, the pastrami isn't listed on their online menu for reference so I don't exactly know what was in his aside from the weiner, tomatoes, and thin cuts of pastrami.   I ordered whatever righteous banh mi lover would...the banh mi. It had the weiner, slices of carrots and radish that you'd find in an actual banh mi, crispy pork belly atop, and some herb seasoning along the bun, and parsley lightly sprinkled on to it.   Unfortunately, looks deceived. I didn't get that banh mi hotdog experience i was expecting. Perhaps I was too literal, but flavor wise was very underwhelming to me. The pickling of the carrots and radish was not evident. I felt the sriracha mayo should have been squirted on there a little more heavily. All my tastebuds picked up was the hot dog, crispy pork belly, and what heat I got from the sriracha. I was really hoping to get that banh mi flavor plus hotdog! And i didnt. So at $7.25 I felt a tad bummed because while I thought it wasn't bad, it just fell short.   My husband thought the same thing. He ate it with no comment so I knew he wasn't mind blown. Later he commented that if the hotdog was around the 5 dollar range the he would have felt different. But at 7.25 and you dont get any perk like a drink or fries with it...he wasnt thrilled. I'd probably come back for the euro fries as raved on other reviews or to try something different. I know for sure I wouldn't take my children here because they don't appreciate hotdogs like that and that'll become a steep bill with drinks and side orders to consider. They're gonna have to explore fusion hotdogs on their own time later in life. Gotta let them have something left to explore on this planet. Lol.  Customer service was very friendly and prompt, restaurant was clean, menu boards everywhere so there's no way you won't be able to find it, seat yourself, and coke vending... =)  Recommend giving them a try for sure! Kid and stroller friendly. A couple tables outside for outdoor seating.   Enjoy!",

I've had the Teriyaki dog and the Southern dog ($7.95 each I believe) and both were exceptional. The meat and toppings were, of course, stellar, but they finish it off with the oh-so-important fluffy and tasty bun. I got some fries as well which were pretty good, though nothing exceptional, but really unless you're quite hungry, the hot dog is enough of a meal on its own. I tried my friend's bacon and mac n cheese quesadilla (great concept!) and it was also terrific, with plenty of stuffing.  I got the punch card and plan on going back many times.",

    "text": "I got this place bookmarked for months and I've been wanting to eat some unusual hotdogs and that's exactly what I got from this place.  Buldogi's is located behind Chicago Brewery - my GPS had me go around the Regal Village Square lot.  My patience paid off.  There's a menu on each table as well as behind the register.  There's also a white board on the wall to the left of the kitchen/register where you'll find a list of burgers and other items not on the menu.  We ordered 2 beef bulgogi dogs, a banh mi dog, buckeye dog and 2 Euro special fries.  We got our food in 10-15 minutes.  They had an NBA game on so I was happy.  Beef Bulgogi Dog: You get pieces of bulgogi on top of a hotdog with some green onions, bulgogi mayo and sesame seeds.  The bulgogi flavor balances the saltiness of the hotdog. I'd give it a 4/5  Banh Mi Dog: You had me at PORK BELLY!  It also has shredded carrots, cucumber and sriracha mayo.  4/5  Buckeye Dog: I saved the best for last.  I thought the banh mi dog was delish then I had a buckeye dog with PORK BELLY BACON, garlic mayo, corn and cheese.  It was like neon lights and fireworks in my mouth! Definitely 5/5!  Euro Special Fries: Crispy potatoes with cheddar cheese, pork belly bacon, herbs and garlic mayo. You have to eat 'em with a fork. After eating 2 hotdogs, trying to finish a basket of fries seemed almost impossible but they're sooo good I had to finish my fries. 4.5/5  I must say though, the garlic mayo has a pretty intense garlic flavor (YUUUUUMMMM!!!) - you can tell they use real garlic and not just garlic powder.  Between the Euro fries and the buckeye dog, I had garlic breath x 2 - good thing I didn't have to be somewhere with someone after eating at Buldogi's.",

It was a bit too salty for my liking.  They have a variety of creative korean fusion hot dog styles.  I'll probably try this again at another time.

I know! There isn't! You know you're about to be in for an awesome meal when the place is packed outside of regular lunchtime hours.  Buldogis is one of those joints in town where I can eat there 100 times and never once will be disappointed at the food.  My faves: Euro fries, a succulent mix of mayonnaise, crispy fries, fried pork belly Banh Mi Dog, all beef dog topped with fried pork belly, kimchi, and the burning desire of a million years of creating the perfect hot dog.  Also, the Angry Fries, sweet potato fries topped with a bunch of yummy stuff including a fried egg.   Seriously people. Just try this place. It's a beefy haven in the midst of mediocre wieners.",

    "text": "Great location tucked away in a little plaza in Summerlin, compared to the other location in Chinatown, this one offers more parking. The shop itself is pretty small, and can seat maybe 15 people top, but it shouldn't be a big problem as when we went there, it was a Friday evening and it wasn't packed.   The menu has expanded to include a variety of burger, and bibim bowl, and a hangover soup + combo. Hot dog wise, they also had added several on the white board on the wall. I ordered the crazy dragon dog, thinking it shouldn't be that spicy.... I love spicy good and honestly have not eaten anything at a restaurant that makes me tear up or has any effect on me. When I got the food and started eating it, at first I thought it was nice, got a nice kick to it. But the more I ate, the more overwhelmingly spicy it got! The dog was laden with a lot of hot kimchi and habanero, and after eating half of it, I had to stop as I couldn't feel anything. I finished my meal by eating carne asada fries, which were amazing and I like the Asian fusion aspect of it.   I was very impressed that there is food out there that actually was too spicy for me! Now would I order the dragon dog again, probably not, simply for the fact that while it wasn't bad, the seasoning itself wasn't as memorable and good as some of the other dogs I've had from this place, eg the angry dog or buldogi dog.",

Don't get me wrong they got some good wieners and I am sure that by themselves maybe with some mustard and relish they would be perfect. But I just wanted the toppings they had they were all delicious.  There were four of us and we ordered 8 and there were about 3 left over... if that means anything to you. I strongly suggest the one with cucumber on it... no idea what it is called but it was so delicious to the taste.   I also regret not getting more sides... so don't follow in this dumber yelpers footsteps and make sure you get more sides.   THE VERDICT: I hope you all see how mature I was in discussing wieners... there were no puns... no sexual innuendos... and no sex ed references. So... that's how you know i took this review seriously. But go to this place... and fill your mouth... with wieners.",

I like my Korean BBQ food and Buldogi's has created a delicious hybrid with hot dogs. The sauces are rich. Unfortunately, the sauces gave me a bit of a cough for a half hour afterwards. But it's worth it. This place puts Pink's to shame. All the staff was great, nice and patient. We arrived 10 minutes before closing, not recommended, but the staff was all too happy to serve us great food. There is a soda fountain and some canned drinks in the frig. It's just a plain place inside with Buldogi memorabilia and news articles praising their dogs. But I didn't need Oprah Magazine to tell me what my tastebuds already knew; it's tasty!",

I stopped eating red meat a few years ago but they have veggie and turkey dogs as a replacement but I do eat pork (the other white meat). They had a dog called \"The Angry Dog\" and used a pork sausage. It was delicious and spicy - yet not overpowering. Great spices and ingredients. Bravo! Came back two days later and had the \"Dragon Dog\" essentially the same but using a Habanero mayo (instead of the Chipotle mayo). This was spicier and the Habanero mayo kept my mouth on fire for the next hour but it didn't deter from the overall taste and flavor. Try it for an afternoon lunch or pre-dinner snack. You won't be sorry! For those that don't like Hot dogs, they also serve burgers and rice bowls in the same Korean-Asian - American fusion.",

My boyfriend had the Bulgogi Burger which was really big and juicy lol...Got my mom the Angry Dog which had spicy pork bulgogi, asian slaw, diced jalapeno, and fiery mayo. Nice & spicy just the way she likes it. I took a star off because I ordered the Bahn Mi Dog but got the Buckeye Dog instead. It was okay but I was really looking forward to trying the Bahn Mi Dog. Will be back when I visit :)",

We drove for what seemed like forever to get here and then drove around the shopping center trying to locate this place, and then it was like the clouds parted and the sun shined down right on the entrance. We decided to be conservative and share two dogs and fries, we chose the Banh Mi and the Chicago dog (I've been craving one since my Chicago trip) wow it was a toss up which one we liked better. Banh Mi was so tasty, the pork belly was perfect with the sriracha mayo and slaw, while the Chicago dog wasn't the same as a True Chicago dog, it was a really good attempt and I would order it again. And then.......the Angry Kimchi Fries, we were so full my the time we got to this, but we couldn't stop eating them! I need to go back and try the Hawaiian dog next and the Euro fries!",

The big guy with the accent tells me and my girl to sit down and someone would be with us.  After sitting there for 5 minutes without anyone approaching us, I decided to go ask the same big guy if someone would be taking our order at our table.  He tells me that I need to order at the register so I remind him that he told me to sit down and someone would be with us.  He then snaps at me and tells me \"I have to cook, too!\"  At that moment I told my girl that we were leaving.  He didn't apologize and went about his business.   It's unfortunate, this place seems like a cool place but I'll never return to a place with such terrible customer service.",

Before my order, the man behind the counter was very helpful. I asked the man behind the counter how big their portions are. He told me 3 hot dogs were roughly the size of one burger and I knew if I ordered that much I most likely could not finish my meal. I also asked what were the usual favorites, his personal favorites and what he would recommend, very helpful service.   They had really good fries, If you're going to eat here might as well order some angry fries to go with your hot dogs cause those fries took all my anger away lol. I ordered the Bulgogi Hot Dog and the Philly Dog and the first bite into the hot dog was absolute bliss. I forgot everything that was bothering me... it was like all the stress was packed into a balloon and flew further away after each bite into the hot dog. The food was so good that I wanted to order more but being a tiny dude I could barely finish one dog. I decided to just order more take it to go and eat it later.  The place had some wonderful music mixed with great food, it made me feel really good. I would recommend this place to all my friends due to how unique their menu is. (where else can you get bulgogi toppings on a hot dog?) This is a really special place, great prices, cool music soundtrack and wonderful people. They kept asking if everything was tasting okay, I loved the attention I was getting! Any food that makes me feel this great deserves a wonderful review. Everyone should try this place at least once in their lifetime, your experience may not be similar to mine unless you go in a very horrible mood lol but nonetheless the food is still great.",

They weren't bad by any means but I've had better hot dogs. I def don't dislike this place so I think eventually I'll try it again and just order something different. This place has good potential and I hope to write a better review on it soon. Friendly service",

You might be happy with the food if it was off of a food truck but not a brick & mortar.  We tried:  Angry dog (good, but nothing special) Banh mi dog (too salty) Chili cheese fries (nothing special, would not order again) Angry kimchi fries (good not great) Carne asada fries (best fries, very tasty with the sauteed onions) Euro fries (mixed reviews from our party)  Overall it's a very heavy meal.",

Flavors were good but for my specific taste there was just a lot amount wise when it came to the hot dog, so I filled up very quick. The flavors in the Euro fries were good but if you don't eat them fairly quick they get kind of soggy, so not so much an item for left overs. It wasn't busy when we arrived & them BOOM tables filled up very quickly. Customer service is amazing! Everyone was super friendly & the food got to up in about 5 minutes. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that likes to try something new, different & delicious!",

    "text": "We decided we'd get something different for dinner and I was off to Buldogis which has been on my radar for a few months.  Driving out of Village Square one evening, I spied Buldogis so now I knew where to go.  For the two of us, I got a Smoked dog, an Angry dog, a small regular fries, and an order of Euro special fries.  I enjoyed the small amount of heat with my Angry dog.  I'd say it was more of an irritated dog than angry.  Perhaps I should have added jalapeno slices so my dog was a bit more angry.  My wife liked her Smoked dog.  The slaw and garlic mayo were very good.  The Euro fries were tasty too.   I was so glad I got things to go.  There is so much topping on the dogs that it gets your hands full of liquid and toppings as they are squeezed off the dog no matter how gently you hoist that doggie!  That's not a problem.  It's just that I'm glad I could be sloppy in the privacy of mine own home rather than dribbling in public.  One downer--in looking at the photos, I saw Vegas J's photo of some bread pudding she'd had for dessert.  No dice.  They don't do desserts anymore.  Oh well, I still have a few 'Lette macarons from my last trip to LA so I had a Plan B that was quite good.  The order was made quickly and the counter guy was very helpful and polite.  Everything was A-OK!",

From the very first visit, I was greeted from the incredible staff and was pleasantly surprised from the food. I remember I was automatically hooked from that first bite. I have never had a bad experience here. Prices is a little expensive for a hit dog, but I think to get what you pay for. The bathroom is actually very clean and smells great. There's always something interesting playing on the tvs, and there's plenty of variety on the menu. Only small complaint I could have is that sometimes there's a lot of topping on a hotdog, and it tends to fall apart. But that's completely ok. Other than that, I don't know what else I could find that's wrong. Oh, the place is always kept clean and all staff is friendly. Don't think twice about the place! Eat here!!!!",

Their menu has a large variety of options, and honestly, everything sounds very good. The service is not bad, but at times could be slow. One hot dog is very filling, and with a side of regular or, even better, chili cheese fries, it could be a little difficult to finish it all. When you come here for a hot dog, keep in mind that it's definitely not the most healthy food choice. And tbh, upon finishing the meal, you probably won't feel like you just ate the best thing for you. But I don't eat hot dogs too often, and I really come here for my hot dog cravings. The food tastes very good and everything is freshly made. Therefore, it's my go-to hot dog place in town.",

A+  Smoked dog (spicy link, caramelized onions, cheddar, avocado mayo): underwhelmed. Average taste. Nothing great.  Euro special fries (pork belly bacon, cheddar cheese, herb blend, garlic mayo): quite a big portion. The bf and I couldn't even finish it. The flavors were bold--particularly the garlic mayo--maybe a tad bit too bold but still rather tasty.  Their menu had quite a selection of dogs I really wanted to try.

They serve quarter pound all beef hot dogs with Asian flare!!  Homemade kimchi is used as toppings among other unique condiments to enhance the flavor of the food. The Bulgogi they use was marinated to perfection, it was slightly sweet, salty (from the soy sauce), and savory.  The hot dogs are unbelievably delicious, just by looking at the pictures it makes my mouth water.  My favorite hot dogs that stood out was the \"Sante Fe Dog\", \"Angry Kimchi Dog w/Sriracha Sauce\" and \"Banh Mi Dog\".   This place is definitely worth the checking out, I highly recommend it!",

What we've had so far: -The Seoul 2 Soul chicken wings (We chose soy caramel and spicy Korean sauce on two separate visits) -Banh Mi hotdog -Euro fries -Angry kimchi fries (it's with sweet potato fries)  One of my good friends graduated on Wednesday so I recommended that the whole group go here. So we ordered the carne asada fries, the bibim rice bowl, and the angry kimchi fries (of course).  Overall, we shared everything because the servings were more than enough and all of my friends gave this place a thumbs up. The staff are consistently pleasant and the place is always clean. I honestly love that they have cute dog decorations everywhere because well... dog aesthetics are iconic.",

    "text": "After being in my bookmarks for so long, I finally got around to trying out Buldogis - I only wish I'd come sooner!! First off, Buldogis has a huge menu with lots of variety beyond their fusion hot dogs, including loaded fries, soups, chicken wings, and new chicken sandwiches. As an avid KBBQ-eater, beef bulgogi is one of my favorite meats, so I opted for the Bulgogi Dog and shared Carne Asada Fries with my friend. Due to the nature of the foods and the toppings I was worried that they might be too salty for me, but I think they ended up being just right! The bulgogi topped on both the dog and fries was cooked really well, tender and full of flavors. The Dog was really good once I figured out how to eat it since it was so loaded! It was also really filling, so I only got through some of the fries. The fries are a bit on the thicker side, but still crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and the flavors of the toppings with the hint of spice combined really well. I'm also glad that neither seemed too greasy or oily. Overall, I'm so happy I was finally able to give this place a shot. The service was quick and the employees were helpful and gave some good recommendations. The interior was nice and clean, and there's a fair amount of space if you want to dine in. Can't wait to revisit and work through their menu, I'm already trying to decide what to try next!",

The bulgogi has more of a savory flavor with the bulgogi topping and was delicious. The banh mi has a little bit more of an acidic kick with the pickled veggies on top but it's a nice complement to the hot dog and the pork topping.  I also had the angry fries here, which are sweet potato fries topped with kim chee, jalapenos, cheese, pork, and a fried egg. That's a nice platter to share among some friends and a cool combination of flavors as well.  The service was great here with the cooks making sure we had everything we needed and the owner hooking it up with free drinks.",

There was another family there already with children also. I got the angry dog again because it's amazing, just the right amount of spicy.  My wife got the teriyaki dog and she couldn't stop talking about it.  We got the puppy dog for my son. .. He didn't like it at first but he warmed up to it when we gave him some fries to eat with it.  It's the prefect size for kids and you can get it plain so there's no mess. We also got an order of the euro fries that we all shared. . Those are by far my favorite.  They have garlic mayo sauce and pork belly.  So freaking good.  If you want to try something different or are just in the mood for an amazing hot dog you should give this place a try.",

They have sides such as fries, deep fried pickles and other things. The hot dogs are large in themselves and I believe are Vienna beef dogs. My only complaint that could turn these great dogs into fantastic dogs would be to do away with the grill and charbroil the hot dogs.. that would make the flavor go from like a 7 to a 10/10",

Tried their Angry Dog - which is a hot dog with pork bulgogi, jalapenos, slaw, and a creamy sauce.  I thought it was pretty good though maybe could use more seasoning overall.  Just could be a little bland at times.  Not salt necessarily but something spicy or tangy.  Just more. Chili Cheese fries - fries were cooked nicely for a chile cheese fry order.  A little crispy on the fries but not too much.  The chili was interesting - think it had corn in it.  They have a pretty big menu so will go back and try more.  Definitely a keeper and definitely different.",

Tasty. Bahn Mi dog was eh ok. Chili Cheese fries were also meh. The kim-chi had a fishy aftertaste. Am not sure if that's normal (was my first kim chi) but it was not something I'll go for again.   But the big takeaway was this: I was MAD THIRSTY all flippin' night. In fact - I kept waking up through the night dying of thirst. So thirsty I had trouble falling asleep.  Are we talking metric ton of MSG? Something else? I have no idea, but that's not a good sign.   Tasty, sure, as much as any hot dog. Definitely scared off from the thirst-o-rama.   To end on a positive note, the service is completely 5-star. Great guys behind the counter and at the stove.  I think I'm still thirsty... :-(",

Nice size place that also offers Burgers as well. Great prices that don't break the bank. The Owner can be a little hard to understand, however very friendly. One decent size dog with Korean toppings and nice size of Carna Asade fires plus drink ran around $17 bucks. The portion on the fries could have been split by two people.

The kimchi fries taste and visualiztion was unique and the serving size was huge (its a large meal all on its own) topped with an easy cooked ( I couldn't tell if it was fried sunny side up, or poached) egg crowning this spicy and tasty treat.

They provide you with a table top and also have a community water bowl for your dog(s).    I tried the veggie and veggie Italian dog. They have the option to make any of their dogs into a veggie or turkey dog. Awesome! Definitely try the Italian dog.

It's a not so average hot dog joint with mash-ups that leave you wondering, \"Why the frump didn't I think of this?!\" I guess it also helps to merge different cultures together. All cultures are represented in a fusion-esq way. The interior was cozy with a diner like feel. The people at the counter were really nice and happy!  It's safe to say that I am a fan of the all mighty (sometimes) mysterious hot dog. If you are as well then you will truly appreciate the slight snap of the casing with all it's  majestic glory. I only wish I had the stomach for some pork belly bacon or chicken.  We ordered:  *Bulgogi - the meat and the slaw was very flavorful, but I personally wasn't too keen on the sauce. Took me over the edge.  *Gagnam -Chopped green onion, thin strips of seaweed, sesame seeds, cucumbers, sauce. Probably my favorite because of it's simplicity. It was refreshing and had the right amount of stuff to keep me interested.  *Carne Asada Fries - not as good as San Diego style. The carne was a lil' on the tough side and the fries got soggy fast. Would have liked an avocado piece or two.  Worth a try for sure!",

Commonly found on the food truck scene across America, chefs are mixing asian infused flavors into traditional foods americans love.  Since i've been a fan of the korean burrito and tacos in Hawaii, I was excited to try Asian Fusion Gourmet Hot Dogs in Las Vegas.  Firstly, if you are a tourist, this may be quite the adventure since it is ways away from the strip.  My buddy who I was boarding with lives on the west side and thus it wasn't too much of a trek for us to try this place out.  The menu has great descriptions of the dogs and what is inside them: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbuldogis.com%2Fmenu.html&s=dc0a8bd4168fa7320854c58478466aa374393be76cb6c69599df61fb8d2783bc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">buldogis.com/menu.html</a>  Here's what we ordered:  Beef Buldogi Dog ($4.95): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZfTTD5yedeSkVfWzp3Si_g&userid=lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Banh Mi Dog ($4.95): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cBGBzIk754zhaSoUBGNgDw&userid=lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Chili Cheese Fries ($3.95): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6mhcXPCr1_XPDDLOK22wrQ&userid=lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Euro Special ($4.75): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9iZ8HwVxJW438frdfSKgig&userid=lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Both of the hot dogs were not bad, my buddy and I really enjoyed the sriracha mayo on the banh mi dog.  It gave a great kick and flavor to the hot dog.  The gourmet hot dog did not blow me away and the ingredients were good separate but together it just did not work for me.  The bun on the hot dog was probably my LEAST favorite, it almost tasted stale and was just underwhelming.  The fries were tasty.  Definitely enough for 2 - 3 people per order.  These fries are fork fries though.  You can use your hands but it is much easier to get the toppings and the fries together if you use a fork.  Personally the fries were decent but I'd take animal style fries from In-n-Out over these fries any day.  My buddy and I were gonna try the angry korean fries but we didn't like the thought of sweet potato.  Overall, its a nice joint with very friendly staff and decent prices.  The food is good, but not quite blow me away, venture all the way from the strip good.    *** PEANUT ALLERGY PEOPLE - please be careful if you ordered what we ordered because my friend has a mild sensitivity reaction to peanuts and his lip swelled up from something he ate. Please be careful!",

My favorites had to be the Fries and the Hangover Soup (of course, after drinking, anything soupy is good). I guess I could try the other hotdogs if I came back, but from what I tried, it wasn't anything to bring home to. I'd definitely recommend the fries though (they were all good).",

    "text": "Wanna change up the $1.50 hot dog run to Costco every once in a while?  Hit up Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs for a fusion meat injection!  Yes.  I said it.  If you don't like meat, and you don't like tube forms...you best go back to sipping on your tofu and kale smoothie.  The words 'meat' and 'treat' are one and the same here!  Buldogis is what it is, a bit of an oxymoron with it's 'gourmet hot dog' moniker.  We all know hot dogs were started to aid with meat rations during the depression, but Buldogis doesn't mind taking it up a notch.  Looking for some variety in your dog, look no further!  Buldogis offers over a dozen different kind of hot dogs, some traditional, some just kind of outta the park different.  But looking at reviews, it's all good.  Yes, you will pay around $5-$6 per hot dog creation so don't visit if you only got $2 on you.  Just won't cut it.  Think of Buldogis as a treat or an experience, not a value meal and you'll be ok.  But no, this place won't break your wallet either (hello nearby neighbor Bachi Burger).  You will still be able to get a decent meal at Buldogis for just shy of $10 a person.  Save some money on your date, share a damn drink!  A couple bucks right there!  Unless your date has halitosis, or mono...or heaven forbid, BOTH.  Then maybe you should rethink your dating priorities.  Here's some of Buldogis seller dogs we tried:  -Angry Dog - spicy pork bulgogi, Asian slaw, diced jalapeno, fiery mayo -Banh Mi Dog - pork belly, banh mi slaw, herb blend, sriracha mayo  Both winners!  The flavors of marinated pork, slaw, and condiments were complimentary to the premium all beef hot dogs served at Buldogis.  A surprising win-win flavor punch to the culinary gut!  KA-POW!  Also had an order of the Euro Special fries, crazy loaded with goodness!  Pork belly bacon, cheddar cheese, and an herb blend garlic mayo.  Heavy on the heart!  Bit of warning - don't go to Buldogis if you are diet watching!  Food is delicious but not light on portions or calories!  I will say that you will have a stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal.  Lots of beef, lots of pork, lots of carbs!  If you must, opt for the Classic Dog or Naked Dog.  But you will sorely be missing out on what Buldogis has to offer.  Buldogis has a specials menu that changes constantly, and offers lots of Korean delights and delicacies.  Also special new hot dog concoctions.  They do burgers, wings, and chicken tenders too, so be on the lookout for those.  Service is fast, but very friendly, and things pick up during the lunch rush.  There is a seating area with around 10-12 small tables but Buldogis is more of a takeout restaurant.  Keep up with the Korean fusion guys, and I will be back to watching another round of K-dramas on Netflix...wondering how I can fit myself into a pair of skinny jeans and drive around in my Hyundai Veloster coupe!",

    "text": "After working up an appetite hiking at Red Rock, my friends and I were looking for a place to eat lunch.  After people threw out a bunch of suggestions we decided to swing by Buldogis to try their infamous hot dogs (and to undo all calorie burning we did earlier).  These were definitely not your average hot dogs.  They were topped with some unique toppings and were much more filling than the typical hot dog you picture in your head.  Here is what I ordered  Angry Kimchi Fries (7.95) - Sweet Potato Fries, spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, cheese, sunny side up egg, green onions, and jalapenos.  I like all of the components of this dish separately and in my head I thought why not put them together.  For the most part it was good, but I think if I were to order this again I would try to see if I could get regular fries instead of sweet potato.  But if you want to try something really different and maybe a little confusing for your taste buds, this might be for you.    *They give good portions of everything!  My intention was to share this with the whole group, except 3/5 of us order fries and all of a sudden were had a fry overload...which isn't totally a bad thing, but we didn't really come close to finishing all of the fries on top of our hot dogs.   Beef Bulgogi Dog (5.95) - A good sized hot dog topped with bulgogi, slaw, green onions, and flavored mayo.  Really yummy and definitely made for a meat lover.  It had great flavors and was filling.  The hot dog bun didn't do too well in holding up, but my knife and fork helped me out in finishing it  A fun place to grab a bite to eat :D",

Granted you can grab a fusion inspired burger and fries if you don't love those snap in your mouth dogs. To keep it simple Buldogis stumbled upon a great idea and made it work to their advantage. I can't seem to get enough of their sweet yet savory Angry Kimchi fries(sometimes made perfect and a couple times a bit greasy), and the oh so decadent Banh mi dog, you can't go wrong with pork belly on anything!  Make sure you come hungry because with all the great selections of custom dogs you're going to want to try them all, or at least bring a friend that will let you snag a bite of theirs when their not looking, cheers!",

We got a chili cheese dog, a bulgogi dog using the vegetarian dog and the angry kimchi fries. My order of the bulgogi with vegetarian wiener seemed to perplex them so they let me know bulgogi was beef. I just didn't feel like having certain cow parts that evening :)   Both dogs were really tasty. The bun wasn't a run of the mill and bought at Costco bun which made it feel more gourmet. I loved the flavor of the angry kimchi fries but I would've preferred regular potato over sweet.   The staff and owner were really nice. They had made an extra bread pudding by mistake and gave it to us for free. The owner told us they make their pudding out of the 2 day old buns they buy direct from a local bakery in town. We had never tried it before since bread pudding always seemed like a way too heavy over the top kind of dessert in restaurants (bread before the entree....and after??) but liked the sweet caramel flavor of this pretty dense \"cake\".  Bottom line is if you love hot dogs, you will love this place.",

Only negative is these hot dogs are so large that if you order one of the complicated versions, they're all but impossible to eat.

The staff was super friendly and portions were huge! We probably could have split the fries and one dog but decided to each do our own. I had the Bulgogi Dog and he had the Bahm Mi (not sure if I spelled those right). Mine was very good, but super messy. I tried his too and it was alright, but not as good as mine. I think the fries ended up being my favorite. They had cheese, pork belly and a seasoned mayo, what's not to love?  A great little place on the southwest side!",

The euro fries were so tasty...the yellow stuff on the top tastes like the top of the cheap garlic bread you can find in the freezer section in Walmart.

When it's Christmas Eve and both myself and my roommate are down in the dumps? What could possibly cheer us up? HOT DOGS, OF COURSE.  So we walk in around 3:30pm and are happy to find that they're open and close at 5pm (phew, we made it!) We are greeted by a smiling face at the cashier. We told him it was our first time and he immediately started explaining the menu. SO... MANY... OPTIONS. It may be intimidating at first, but there is just so much to offer in the world of hot dogs.  We finally made up our minds and I ordered the Bulgogi Dog and my roomie ordered the Mac and Cheese dog. We also ordered a side of fries topped with pork belly, cheddar cheese, and garlic mayo.  The food came out in a timely manner, fresh and hot. We were served at our table. It was love at first bite. The bulgogi that was on top of the all beef hot dog was so juicy and flavorful. The slaw was also very good. I noticed my roomie was already demolishing her Mac and Cheese dog but she willingly let me have a bite of it. Btw, whoever thought of hot dog + mac and cheese + bacon was a freakin' genius. And the fries were so tasty and in a HUGE portion. We had to ask for a to-go box for it so we could sneak them into a movie, lol.  The customer service here is exceptional. The workers are so friendly and very accommodating.   Definitely coming back to try the West Coast Dog!",

FOOD They have a unique variety of hotdogs that you won't find anywhere else. Hotdogs are $6-7 but pretty small so I would recommend that you order their classic French fries or fried pickles on the side. Or two hotdogs.  Euro Special Fries: My personal favorite! I always get this when I visit Buldogis. It's a regular French fries with pork belly, cheese, herb and garlic mayo. Fries are super crispy, pork belly is seasoned well (although it is on the saltier side) and I love their creamy garlic mayo that's drizzled on the fries. Huge portion as well. 5/5  Buckeye Dog: Pork belly bacon, corn relish, cheddar and garlic mayo. Flavor was similar to Euro Fries, but corn added some sweetness. 3/5  Hawaiian Dog: Pork belly, pineapple salsa, g-onions and honey dijon mustard. It was like they added Mexican twist because of salsa but then added Hawaiian touch with pineapple. Overall, too much going on for me. I prefer Buckeye over this one. 2/5  CONCLUSION I think the weiner they use in hotdogs are too salty to begin with. Then they add sauce and other things which makes it overwhelming. I will just stick with their Euro Fries from now on.",

We are huge foodies and generally take a mom and pop establishment over a corporate food chain restaurants any day out of the week. What we really loved about Buldogies was it's risky twist in turning a basic dog into a Korean infused work of art! Kimchee and bulgogie with your dog?! I know, sounds crazy, but trust me, it's amazing! Caesar, the owner was an extremely nice gentleman when I asked if he could throw something together that my mom (Korean) would make us growing up.  He didn't hesitate and he made it exactly how my mom made it! We also had the wings......killer! Super crispy and full of flavor, you really don't need dipping sauce! If you're bored of the same ol chain restaurant experience, please take my advice and give Buldogies a try, it won't disappoint!!!!",

    "text": "This is a 3.5 rounded up to a 4 because these guys deserve the nod for a couple of reasons.   My own meal here wasn't the best-- I opted for the burger and that was a huge mistake. The burgers here are pretty unremarkable-- you could get a better burger at a Chili's or even a Carls Jr. They were overcooked and the quality of the meat is rather poor and just lacking in flavor. Whatever you do DO NOT BOTHER WITH THE BURGERS. This is a hot dog place and that is what they do best. The bulgogi meat on the burger was fairly tasty and the sauce was quite creamy and a bit tangy.  My girlfriend went with the bulgogi dog which was topped with the same bulgogi meat, and was actually quite tasty. The dog is cooked just right and the toppings perfectly compliment the meat.  We also ordered the chili fries and they were pretty enjoyable but I keep hearing such good things about the Angry Kimchi fries that I'll have to try them next time.  The reason I was generous and edged these guys up to 4 stars is because they are both innovative and affordable. Also, our server was very friendly and everyone knows that's a plus at eateries. This is a reasonable place to take the family for dinner and you get a unique spin on hot dogs that makes these guys worth driving to. If I am back in the summerlin area, I will give them another go and I'm sure i'll enjoy it.",

Love the slices of tender bulgogi Korean-style beef, Asian slaw, green onions, special sauce, all piled high on a yummy grilled dog.  Like plate lunch on a bun. Makes me want to drive right over and get one--just wish they had a drive-through!  Parking is usually available right out front, so only a few steps into Buldogis.",

    "text": "My brother got me to try Buldogis for the 1st time yesterday. (Yeah, I know. I'm late to the party.) Congratulations to Buldogis!!! A spot I consider to be the only accepted form of Korean fusion. True fusion isn't simply stock-piling ethnic ingredients in non-ethnic foods. It's about merging 2 cuisines together to create something special. *sunshine and rainbows over*  I wanted to try a little of everything so we ordered a Korean Hangover Soup + Kangnam (Gangnam) Dog + Angry Kimchi Fries. The soup had a homemade quality to it. I'm not sure exactly what kind of soup it is but I want to say it's like a not-so-spicy Yukgaejang w/ chicken instead of beef. It's a savory and not-too-salty broth with an herbal tone filled with tasty vegetables, chunks of chicken and dangmyeon (sweet potato noodles). I could probably live without hot dogs. Although they use 100% premium beef franks, I still get a sick feeling after eating one. It's either guilt or nitrates eating away at my soul. The Kangnam was tasty but I think their Bulgogi Dog would've been a better choice. I am totally obsessed with their Angry Fries. They look absolutely terrifying when they approach the table. Sweet potato fries topped with spicy pork, fried kimchi, an egg and other goodies. It sounds like an artery blocker because it is. But surprisingly, Korean food and sweet potato marry perfectly in this paper plate.  In summary, I am no longer the anti-Christ of Korean fusion. It can be done and Buldogis does it well. Can't wait to be back to try their Carne Asada (bulgogi) Fries!",

The restaurant is small but clean and welcoming. One of employees immediately greeted us (my co-worker and I) with a welcome and explained some of their items.  I ordered an Angry Dog (with extra jalepenos) and fries. What came out was a hotdog piled with vuliminous portions of spicy pork, slaw, and jalepenos. My poor bun succumbed to the weight of the toppings and fell apart. The use of utensils is inevitable. Amidst the mountain of toppings, I could still taste the salty goodness of the hotdog. My fries were excellent; they were crisp and seasoned. However, I could barely finish all my food. I left gassy yet satisfied.",

Their truck was one of our favorites from the day (my husband got the Banh Mi).  Since they are located on the opposite side of town from us we hadn't had a chance to visit their actual brick-and-mortar location until today.  This time I ordered a Buckeye dog and it was absolutely incredible! I was full after eating half of it... But it was too good to leave uneaten :-P",

As a Korean-American intuned IN Korean Culture- it makes me feel like home -  they are also food truck owners too   they also will expand & working their alcohol license too & they will also soon will have MAKE YOUR OWN HOTDOGS- doesnt have to be Korean- it can be a Philly Dog too-  -trust me it is pretty worth it-  they got kicked out on SPRING MOUNTAIN !!  LETS BRING THEM BACK TO A CLOSER LOCATION !!  you wont regret it- PROMISE -  coming from a VERY PICKY KOREAN-AMERICAN EATER-  try the ANGRY DOGS, KIMCHI HAMBURGER- BULGOGI HAMBURGER-  10 min - 20 min wait depending how many people are there   if you're an asian fusion lover -GO GO GO-  DID I MENTION \"HANGOVER SOUP\"",

I have to try the \"dragon\" one next time...my friend mentioned it was spicy.  The baby size hot dog was a cool idea.  I think it only cost about a dollar, but a cool way for the baby to have some without having to share or make us buy an entire hotdog to go to waste.  Look for it if you have a kid with a small appetite.  Again, a solid hotdog...can't really beat it for the price and quality.",

The classic fries would have been better as steak fries with more seasoning....  It's kinda small inside-they have a big board on one of their walls wiith lots of hand written specials....It was quiet when we walked in but once a group of teens came in the place was crowded and loud.   Sadly, Buldogis is just too far away to frequent but if they open up a location in the Silverado Ranch area I would be more than happy to eat lots of their yummy Hotdogs!!!!",

    "text": "Oh geez - after looking at all the pics for this place I practically had a food boner!  I drove over there ready to be amazed.    It is a small mom and pop joint with an easy going atmosphere.  The menu was unique and I was intrigued.  The food was fresh, cheap and plentiful.  There really is no reason not to like this place.  Sorry to reprot: I was disappointed in the food.  We ordered a Bahn Mi & a Buckeye hot dog plus an order of fries.    I wanted to love this place but this is one bandwagon I simply cannot get with.  Basically, you get a hot dog topped with a garrish array of competing ingredients.  The food didn't go together.  The toppings and the dog were not in harmony.  It is kinda like when the Houston Rockets teamed Olajuwon with Drexler and then added Barkly.  Three great players but they just didn't seem to go together.   The Buckeye dog - pork belly, corn, cheese and mayo-  just didn't work. The Bahn Mi - Pork belly, slaw, siracha mayo- just didn't work.  The fries were just normal too.  They were supposed to have parm cheese but I tasted nothing.  Maybe a sprinkle of some spice mixture and that's it.  I didn't even finish the hot dogs or the fries.  This place has great reviews - so by all means check it out.  This is just one guy's opinion.  I guess I just like my dogs with some kraut and mustard...",

    "text": "Buldogis is quite far from the strip.  Luckily, I had some business in the area and was only a mile away.  I came here for lunch after yelping it.  The menu looked interesting and I always want to try something different.  After scrolling through the pictures, I knew I had to try the angry kimchi fries.  I love sweet potato fries!  When you add spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, 4 cheese blend, green onions, diced jalapeno, and a fried egg, how can you go wrong? You can't!  It was surprisingly really good.  I ate 95% of it.  I was expecting the fries to go limp towards the end, but they held up nicely.  The spicy pork bulgogi could be spicier, but that's just me.  My level of spiciness would probably be too much for the average person.  All the dogs can be made as a burger.  The banh mi burger sounded good.  It was pretty decent.  The buns were toasted which is always a plus.  The meat was juicy and seasoned well.  The pickled carrots and daikon needed a little more punch.  Perhaps they wanted to Americanize it and that's why it was slightly pickled.  Sadly, the bottom bun had turn to mush before I even took one bite.  I would probably get the banh mi dog next time.  The angry dog was excellent!  The dog had a nice kick to it.  Every bite was full of flavor.    Overall, I would definitely go back.  Actually, I'm looking forward to it on my next trip to Vegas in two months.  Service was friendly, but a little slow since the cashier was also the server.",

I'm fat but I shared this with some co-workers. Everyone really enjoyed this and was told the next time I go here during  work I have to call and order for the crew. Gang Nam was fantastic. Angry dog was no slouch either. I will be going back and going to go through the menu so I can see if I can find anything better. I heard the chili is a recipe passed down and was tweaked a bit. Nothing like authentic chili. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu. They also have specials for the day. Not sure how often they are changed since I have only been there once but hopefully I can get through some of those also.",

I can't remember everything, but here's what was new that i liked...  - Angry kimchi fries: great taste. kim chi not too hot. sweet potato fries were crispy. i love eggs made over-easy :) - Euro special fries: i think taste better than the angry kimchi fries. the mayo gives it a nice zest. french fries stay warmer longer than the sweet potato fries. bacon with fries are always delicious. - bulgogi buger: very flavorful. highly recommended!  - budogi burger: from what i could remember, i prefer the bulgogi burger better.  - angry kimichi hot dog: not too spicy. pretty much the same toppings as the fries but with bulgogi on top too.   - We forgot to check-in to get the 10% off, but she allowed us to get something off of the menu for free. very friendly :)! definite +",

The girl at the counter was very friendly and came to check on us too.   Hawaiian Dog (pork belly, pineapple salsa,grilled onions, honey mustard) - The hotdog used itself was really good. More like a sausage and had some snap when you bite in. The added pork belly was something I ate separately since it just felt extraneous.   The BF got the Bahn Mi Dog (pork belly, bahn mi slaw, siracha mayo ) which was a bit better with the pork belly and that one had crispier pork unlike mine.   We shared a large of their buldogis fries which was good. I like somewhat thick fries that are a bit crisp yet soft like that.   It seemed like the hot dog itself is quality, I was just not convinced by the combination of it with meat on top. Next time I'll try just a plainer dog or try the meat in a bowl and I'm pretty sure I'll like it much better.",

The seating area inside isn't that big so I imagine during certain rushes it can be tricky getting a seat if you were planning on eating inside. There was a large party eating while we were there but, I did see several people come in to place orders to go. I picked a seat next to the wall that has writing on it. The wall has various menu items written on it and other sides. I thought it was real cool that they had \"yelp\" written at the top on the wall. We waited as out food was cooked fresh. I had planned on ordering the \"Euro Fries\" however last minute I saw a flyer near the cashier that said they had these new \"Carne Asada Fries\" and I quickly decided to try that!. To be honest the meat was chewy and had no flavor. I wouldn't care for that again but everything else on the fries I would eat over and over. It had fresh made chipotle mayo and avocado mayo that complimented the fries well! My man had the \"Smoked Dog\". That was a spicy link (he said it wasn't spicy at all but tasty) with caramelized onions, slaw (he had that left off), cheddar and garlic mayo. He enjoyed it a lot!   When I checked in for the first time I noticed that there was a 10% off your order! Bonus!  This isn't your average hot dog place. Get out of your comfort zone and try something different!",

Bulgogi Dog ($4.94) - Bulgogi, Asian slaw, green onions, sesame seeds, bulgogi mayo. Don and I LOVED this hotdog. It was piled with ingredients and loaded with deliciousness. The hotdog itself was very juicy. The bulgogi was tender and the combination of Asian slaw, green onions, and bulgogi mayo added so much flavor.   I will definitely be back. They have a lot of items on their menu and I'm sure they're all very tasty.",

Even if you aren't a huge hot dog lover, you can still appreciate the flavors that are added to their hot dog creations from their asian fusion offerings to their interpretation of American favorites like a Philly Cheesesteak. Sauces taste fresh as well as the ingredients, and not soggy at all. I do not recommend trying to eat this in your car because you need to mimick the Guy Fiere hunch and bite to avoid a mess. Now, I just wish they had another location closer to Henderson.",

    "text": "It seems like Korean-fusion hot dogs are the next thing, like kogi tacos and burritos were a few years ago. I saw a spot like this in LA and although it didn't last long, it was a great spot. So I was very excited to see this place in what I envision is not a very ethnic neighborhood. Suffice to say I wasn't going to leave Vegas without going these guys a shot.   The menu is pretty authentic (insofar asinine legit Korean staples with American hot dogs and fries). They even throw in some Mexican influence, with Pico de gaillo and five-blend cheese in some items. Service is friendly and attentive. Whoever was working the counter came by and checked on me twice AFTER bringing my food. Sweet, genuine girl. Most importantly, the hot dogs themselves were fantastic. Casing didn't explode with hot grease when it bit into it, and was just the right temperature. Toppings were ample, but not such that I couldn't take a whole bite and get all the flavors. Only criticism is have is that the ketchup supply could be changed. They have a generic packet supply and I must have gone through at least 10 of them for my fries and one hot dog. I'm always a proponent of Heinz ketchup pumps.   Overall, this is a great place for a solid twist on hot dogs. We don't have enough hot dog joints, so I hope Buldogis builds a solid fan following and customer base.",

    "text": "I would have given a 5 star if the location itself had been bigger. We almost didn't get a seat, but because we waited around for 20 minutes a table cleared out. The food is 5-Star!!!  We had 4 adults and 2 toddlers, our order included a bit of a sampler so we could try different things...  Euro Special Fries- Delicious! 2 adults thought a little mayo-heavy, but still enjoyed them. Other 2 adults and both toddlers loved them.  Angry Kimchi Fries- Kind of a let down. They were hyped up on yelp, but just not so great in our opinion (all 4 adults). Just a little too busy, we couldn't taste any discerning flavors.  Jumbo Corn Dog- Typical corn dog. Good, but nothing special.  Chicken Tenders- Surprisingly good. Chicken was moist, hot, and the breading stayed on nicely. All of the adults stole pieces from the toddler they were meant for while she was distracted by the Euro Special Fries.  Buckeye Dog- Out of the 5 hot dogs, this one got a solid 3rd place rating. Very good, enjoyed the corn relish that was on it. Flavorful.  Hawaiian Dog- This one is tied for 2nd place with the Banh Mi. Everyone enjoyed this one, just wished it had a little more of the pineapple salsa on top. Bright sweet flavors, plentiful with scrumptious pork belly.  Banh Mi Dog-This one is tied for 2nd place with the Hawaiian. The one adult who didn't like the teriyaki dog claims this to be the best of the best and could eat this one and no others and be happy. Very refreshing with vibrant flavors.  Teriyaki Dog- This was the clear winner, 3 out of 4 adults put it in 1st place. Smothered in teriyaki meat with perfect flavors.  Angry Dog- The flavors were nice, but this one got last place by everyone. Yes, it is called the Angry Dog because it is spicy. We all knew that going in, but it was overwhelmingly spicy with a raw harsh burn to it that mottled out the flavor quite a bit. If they cut back the anger a little, the taste would be easier to judge. This is coming from 2 wusses and 2 people that love spice and put peppers and ghost chili salt on everything!  Overall, we will definitely be going back, there are still some good looking things to try and my wife is desperate for another Banh Mi Dog!",

Except me... I'm always judging LOL. I will definitely be out there to get another dog when I get a chance. It's a very small interior restaurant. You can also get very busy very quick.

I tried the Angry Kimchi Dog, which included a huge hot dog (maybe a one-pounder?), spicy pork, ripe kimchi, and a spicy aioli sauce. It's about $8.50, but is big enough to fill you up. Besides this dog, there are about a dozen other options including a Banh Mi Dog and a classic dog ($4). After that, the menu gets a little crazy. It includes a bunch of Korean or quasi-Korean options including a beef rice bowl (bulgogi bibimbap), hangover stew (though not the blood sausage variety you'd get at a traditional Korean restaurant), and Korean fried chicken. I tried the soy-caramel wings, but I wasn't too impressed. They were good, but not anything I'd order regularly.   In the end, Buldogis seems to be the result of the creative mind of a chef who wanted to fuse Korean and Asian tastes with a simple hot dog. I really enjoyed my eating experience even if I didn't think everything was perfectly flavored, and wish I had a few more visits to sample the rest of the hot dog choices.",

We went to grab a bite and all the things on the menu looked good so it was hard deciding which thing to try this time. I ended up trying the mac n cheese dog and the angry kimchi fries. They were both delicious. I'm not a huge fan of kimchi and ended up taking some of it off because it was too much for my taste, but it was still really good. My friend ordered the mac n cheese dog, but added bacon to it and I kind of wish I did too because it was even more amazing. My boyfriend ordered the chicago dog and the carne asada fries and he was very impressed. I don't eat hot dogs very often, but I will for sure be back to try the hawaiian and get the fries again. Everything was amazing and definitely worth trying out.",

The pictures online definitely drew us in. But reality was it was sad. But this review is just for the two items I ordered so maybe I just was unlucky and ordered the least two favorite items on the menu and the rest are <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.  just leaving my honest opinion on what I had today. tip: don't put the pork belly with just straight fat on the dog and for the Mac in cheese put more cheese or maybe change up the cheese so it allows the quesadilla to stick like it should.

    "text": "So might be thinking updating the review for the third time. First off always been fan of the whole asian style hot dogs and fan of Buldogis from my first visit. I have never had a bad experience with the food or the service. On my most recent visit not only got to try some new menu items. The Angry Burrito and the Kimchi Chicken Quesadilla. The Angry Burrito talk about filling Burrito. Spicy Bulgogi am HUGE fan of...love it in the angry dog and now in Burrito. Not enough ways could have it. Ok maybe just huge bowl of it by itself. lol.   Really point of my review is not about the food. The food at Buldogis speaks by itself and the reviews. Amazing. Taking service to another level more like six stars if yelp even had such a thing. I know think REALLY but when tell you story might be surprise. So came with my roommate for some takeout after watching our Vegas Knights win another game on Stanley Cup run. It was three days after the fact got god blessed amazing message on yelp. The business owner daughter had feeling left my debit card at the restaurant. I checked and realize I did. So responded back come in the restaurant next day. Lucky got quick response back just show my driver license for verification and good to go. Honest talk about customer service to six star level!!! First off have courtesy keep it in safe for couple days see if someone come back in the restaurant. Then to figure it out cause posted picture to the yelp page of the new menu items. Shows not only a commitment to highest customer service. To reach out. Still make sure check my ID in this day and age of ID theft. It kind of made me cry. In this day and age of corporate world feels live in. See the reason why hardly dine on the Vegas strip but would rather go small business off the strip. This is WHY is that get that personnel touch and small business owners appreciate loyal customers. Buldogis is a shining example of it!!! Mahalos......",

Once we got there, we realized everything looked delicious and it smelled super good inside. We went a little crazy when ordering, but we figured leftovers were not at all a problem. My boyfriend ordered the bulgogi burrito and soy caramel wings. I got the bulgogi hotdog. We also got the Mac and cheese quesadilla, because yolo. Everything was delicious! The Mac and cheese quesadilla was surprisingly amazing. I'm definitely coming back and bringing friends and family.",

The spot is really small but you can't miss it with their food truck outside. There were two men manning the grill and taking orders. They were really nice and got my take out order out quick. I ordered the angry hot dog, carne asada fries, and kimichi chicken quesadilla. My favorite was the carne asada fries. It was the best carne asada fries I ever had!!! The hot dog was good, especially like the toppings like cabbage with a spicy sauce. I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach because there is A LOT left over but tomorrow will be here soon...lol.",

    "text": "So I decided to give this place a try based off a review from one of my friends and I was a little skeptical going in but I definitely left a super fan!!!!  So let's get down to business, first off the building is hard to find because it's tucked in on the back side of the complex and across from Chicago brewery, the reason I was able to find it was they put their food truck in the parking lot which helps a lot. So upon walking in it has a very upbeat vibe with a couple of tv's and some top 40 music and some articles about the business and where it has been featured which is pretty cool so you can see the journey.  So since my friend rated it so highly I really wanted to try everything on the menu but I settled for a Carne Asada fry, chicken wings , and a philly cheese steal hot dog . So let's start with the hot dog- it was packed with toppings and meat and was more than a mouthful and very flavorful. The presentation was just like the picture and it had a little Asian zing with the type of green onions they use, it is a quality dog but if I had to choose it was the bottom 3 of the items I had and I say that with high regards for the dog since it was fantastic! Next was the wings- so they had 2 flavors on the menu  I never tried before which was soy Carmel and spicy Korean and I could not decide and my inner turmoil must have shown on my face because the nice clerk said he would do half and half which was the best thing he could have told me :). So the soy Carmel was so delicious and Carmely ( if that's even a word) and was almost like a dessert which was different and amazing all at the same time and the spicy Korean was lightly breaded with a nice crisp and was more mild but exploded with flavor, definitely a must try.  Now on to the highlight of the trip....... the carne Asada fries. Now I'm thinking there is no way a hot dog Asian-flair place can make a carne Asada fry taste right , but boy was I wrong. The fries were nice and crispy with a light crunch but not over done and topped with tons of meat, cheese , special house sauces , green onions, and Carmelized onions. It's hard to even describe the combination of flavors that explode with every bite, from the slight spice of the chipotle aioli to the seasoning of the meat to the Asian style crunchy green onions, I must say I was highly impressed and everything came together and was married perfectly. The portion sizes are big and you will definitely leave full and satisfied and the staff was very nice.   I can see why this place has so many 5 stars and I will be back to try more items after I digest all this flavorful goodness",

As a vegetarian, there are plenty of hearty no meat options to choose from, which was much appreciated for a hot dog place. There were a couple of items that piqued my interest: the vegetarian dog (with mac n cheese), Euro special fries (without the pork belly), mac n cheese quesadilla, and the vegetarian burrito. I ended up getting the burrito, and it was sooo delicious! They've marinated some meat replacement with bbq marinade and it completely provides you with that meat tasting fix. Definitely a heavy type of meal. Will definitely be going back again!",

I am super late, as I thought Buldogis was only a food truck (and I hate standing in the Vegas heat for lines!) -- but upon discovering it an actual restaurant when browsing Yelp for a new place to lunch, we decided it was a must try!   FOR HER:  - Torn between all the options, I opted for the BULGOGI HOT DOG (covered in korean beef bulgogi, asian slaw, green onions, sesame seeds, bulgogi aoili). What an awesome protein filled delight! Extremely filling with excellent bulgogi beef flavor! FOR HIM: - He tried the MAC & CHEESE HOT DOG (covered with homemade creamy mac & cheese, cheddar and herb blend). He said the two were a match made in heaven and he quite possibly may never try anything else on the menu -- it was THAT good! We also split an order of the EURO SPECIAL FRIES (french fries smothered with bacon, cheddar cheese, herb blend and garlic aioli). Oh my yum... this place is the ultimate cheat meal all in one! We killed that thing and were stuffed full!   Would we come back? Oh, my... YES! I have yet to try the Hawaiian hot dog, mac & cheese quesadilla, angry kimchi sweet potato fries and a handful of other unique fusion masterpieces this place has to offer! :)",

The bahn mi was pretty good too, although if I didn't know, wouldn't have guessed it was supposed to be bahn mi inspired. We also got the euro fries. The toppings and sauce were great although were quickly gone on top and left behind a fair amount of fries underneath with no euro flavorings.  Im glad I tried them but they seemed a bit expensive for not having full flavoring of all the fries in the euro taste.  Would gladly go again to try the other flavors, but maybe will skip the fires next time.",

However are there's in a paradigm shift with the food here and it concerns me.   The last 2 trips here left me a underwhelmed and disappointed.   It seemed that the love is lost with the food.The food prep, taste and presentation was far from the standard that I've come to expect from this place.  1.The meat topping on the dog and fries were huge clumps and tasted like a dirty burnt grill. 2. The bun was wet (not from the sauce) but from what I assume was condensation from pulling it out of the freezer.  3. There were huge chunks of veggies on both items. rest There seemed to no love or craftsmanship with the food prep.  4. The food prep killed this dishes I don't want to sound like I am exaggerating on this but the chunkyness of the toppings caused you to eat them separately, failing to blend the flavors properly. I'd get a mouthfull of meat on one bite and then a mouthfull of veggies on another....     I don't want to criticize too much as I have always been fond of the food here it has missed the mark the last 2 times.   Please take heed of the honest feedback and restore your food back to the glorious stature it once held in my heart and stomach.   Until then, I cannot put my shiny must-eat recommendation on the food anymore..",

    "text": "Dragged the BF here for a quick late lunch- we've been to a few \"gourmet hotdog\" places, and they've been pretty hit or miss for us. But I had a feeling about this place, and when it was featured as Yelp LV's review of the day last week, I knew I had to go soon.  We arrived for a late lunch around 3PM. Two guys working- an owner-looking fella and a young cook. Stood at the counter for a good five minutes being ignored as they filled orders and walked them to tables without acknowledging me. BF eventually stood in line for me, asked to place an order, and was apologized to a few times about the delay. Guess customer service isn't quite the strong suit here.  In their defense, even for a late lunch, the crowd was steady- we ordered the bulgogi beef and the bahn mi dogs, plus an order of the chili cheese fries. I loved the bulgogi dog- piled high with beef and green onions, it was tasty without being overwhelming. BF preferred the bahn mi, which had a good assortment of crunchy veggies and pork belly, with srircha mayo that had a good kick to it. We really could have done without the chili cheese fries, and they were underwhelming- the fries were unsalted and the chili was very basic, we should have stopped at the dogs or tried the Euro Special instead.  Was impressed enough with the dogs we had to come back- BF is already making a list of what he wants to try on his next visit. But we're more likely to split 3 dogs than do 2 plus a side of fries next time. One dog is easily a meal for a girl or guys who don't have huge appetites, so don't go overboard ordering. Decent prices, too: think everything is about six dollars each, from the dogs and burgers to pimped-out fries.",

    "text": "This is the place I dream about!  Yep, after eating here I had dreams of my meal and I woke up the next morning with a big smile just remembering the blissful bites of fantastic hot dogs and tummy ticking fries I had here.  Yummmmmmy is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to describing Buldogis!  So I know I am behind on getting over here but I finally made it here for lunch this week.  Woo Hoo!  I had some friends visiting and wanted to take them someplace they definitely don't have back home.  Mission success on that!  They were amazed at the menu and the crazy dogs they have at Buldogis.  I just love blowing people's minds when it comes to food.  He he.  Ok, on to the awesomeness know as Buldogis food!  I had the Buckeye Dog and Euro fries.  I was in love at the first bite of both things.  The Buckeye bog was the best dog I have EVER eaten in my life.  It sounds crazy with pork belly bacon, corn relish, cheddar, and garlic mayo all on a hot dog, but it totally works!  The flavors are intense but fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. It is like fireworks going off in your mouth.  Plus it comes covered in MAYO, which is my favorite condiment in the universe.  I mean it is even in my Yelp tagline.  I love me some mayo. Yum.  Oh and the Euro Fries....Drool.  This fabulous combination of fries, cheddar, pork belly, and guess what, more herb garlic MAYO on top.  What is not to love???  The fries are what will bring me back again and again for years to come.  Love them!!!!  My friends were a little more timid with their dogs and they went with the classic standby chili cheese dog and chili cheese fries.  I only tasted the fries and they were really tasty.  The chili is the beanless kind and quite flavorful.  I really liked it myself.  My friends both really enjoyed their dogs and fries.    My mini me went with a corn dog.  It tasted like your average corn dog and wasn't super duper, but was tasty. Good news on the corn dog was that she actually ate 1/2 of it.  If you know her, you know that is amazing because she never wants to eat anything except cookie.  So success on getting a toddler to eat food too!  So the moral of the story is get yourself to Buldogis ASAP because your mouth will thank you for the flavor adventure!  Tasty!",

I have tried other hotdog trucks before but Buldogis have my heart because of their Asian/Hawaiian twists to it.   We were in their Sahara location so we gave them a try. They offer a lot of other food on their menu now including the Hangover Soup. I might come back sooner just to try one of their burgers too. Three things that we ordered:   #1 - Bulgogi Hotdog    3.5/5 #2 - Ban Mi Hotdog       5/5 #3 - Hawaiian Hotdog  5/5  I liked all of the things that we ordered. I personally loved the Hawaiian dog. It came with a pineapple salsa which was tangy which blended so perfectly with the saltiness of the hotdog. The crispy pork belly was a plus. I love me some fatty pork!   I will definitely come back to try other items in their menu. Especially the burgers, they all sounded so interesting!",

With 6 different kinds of mayo, 21 toppings, 4 varieties of dawg, you can make magic happen. Be warned, the dogs are big. So even if you get one without toppings, it's still a meal. Don't miss out on the fries either. Toppings galore on those babies.   I rocked an East Coast Dog (pastrami, kraut, tomato, buldogis mayo) on my last visit. The combo of pastrami and hot dog is phenomenal. The mayo sounds gross, but isn't your standard mayo, so don't be scared. It added flavor to bring the meats together. Great dog all around!  I don't necessarily go out for hot dogs often. But when I do, I make it Buldogis.",

I very rarely eat red meat, or pork, I basically only eat chicken and turkey. I'm super boring. It was Santiago,  myself, and mi amigo and this was our dinner. I was basically starving so I went with the Euro Special Fries and a chicken corn dog, Santiago ordered a puppy dog and small fries, and said friend ordered carne Asada Fries (Straight beaner! ) we had a seat and waited for our order.   It didn't take too long when our food arrived. Being a awesome Yelper I snapped a photo of my fries before sucking them down like a hoover. Theyre simple, fries, pork belly bacon, cheese, and garlic mayo. They should have melted the cheese some, alas it was just cold cheese. The bacon was also a little crunchy or overcooked, but I was too enamored in my food to even care. The garlic mayo really sets the flavors off! Tye corn dog was super huge and not all nasty and over cooked. The center was juicy and the breading was crispy! Santiagos puppy was a half hot dog and it looked delectable,  he gobbled it right up, as with his fries.   Said friend was only half pleased with his carne asada fries, he didn't like the caramelized onions and we both agreed they shouldve used a cream as opposed to the mayo. But he sucked them down as well!   My only gripe is the mustard packets they had were gross. The mustard inside was a nasty color and it was hella thick. Trust me I do not mind thick at all, just this was nasty. Other than that I will def go again for those crack fries!!  Yay!!!",

    "text": "Buldogis have been on my radar for quit some time now and I finally got the chance to try them out. They use to be a food truck  but now they have a Resturant on Sahara and Fort Apache right next to the Chicago Brewing Co. To go from a truck to a brick and mortar place says a lot about their food I think. Well in most cases it does and in this case it's good! Besides I'm glad they did and even if they were a bit out of the way I'd rather drive a little distance then to chase a truck around town all day.  The Resturant is totally small but with tons of seating a little crowed but not super tiny either. The music is pumping and the decor is......divy. They have mix match dog decor and posters and magazine ads up everywhere boosting their fame and love for Bulgogidogs. Theirs a small chest height bar up against one of the windows with stools and a little outdoor patio with tables and chairs out front to really maximize their square footage in a smart way. So there's no shortage of seating.   Being a guy that loves all things hotdog this place really peaked my interest and to up the ante it's gourmet and a Korean fusion. Also I love it when you spend some good money and get a great amount of food, because it really sucks when you go somewhere and not only is your wallet empty but you leave with an empty stomach as well, not here. Here at Buldogis you won't go hungry.  The angry dog with the fiery sauce and the bulgogi was awesome just prepare yourself to bite into fire, not literally but close. The Hot Dogs themselves are deep fried to achieve the perfect crunch and snap on the outer casing. The bulgogi itself was cook with great seasoning and enough char. It is topped with a fiery sauce which is spicy mayo and fresh chopped jalapenos and the pop of each little sesame seed makes it the right choice for the type of bun.   Repeat all that on the Angry fries and add green onions, melted cheese, kimchi and a fried egg. The runniess of the yolk helps with he heat from all that spiciness. The kimchi had a great crunch and didn't over power with it's kimchiness and if you've had kimchi before you know what I mean. It is served in a huge portion normally with sweet potato fries but I subbed it with regular season fries and boy was I satisfied and happy I made that change.   The corn dogs are not made in house but but first bite you wouldn't care because it's one of the best corn dogs I've ever tasted. The dog inside is the same dog they use for their hot dogs which you know that's good and the perfect ration of batter with it's crunch and slightly sweet cornbread batter was so amazing I can eat it all day!   I can continue on and on a out the other menu items I ordered but this will become the longest review ever so I will leave it at that just go try it because take my word it will be worth it. The prices are ok but can get pricey especially if you want to try everything on their menu and you would want to because everything sounds so good. I now want to go back and try their Hawaiian Dog and their fried pickles. The sweet and spicy if that dog just make my tastes bud dance. Anyhow go grab a Buldogi, take a bite and be happy because that's what will happen when you do just that!",

    "text": "Wow this place was busy during Friday lunch hour. I've been wanting to try this place ever since the first picture of Angry Kimchi Fries was posted. I like hot dogs too, so it was an easy decision to try this place out. I went with a coworker who expressed his doubts about the place yet reluctantly accompanied me. I will admit that if you get fries and a hot dog, it's rather pricey for lunch. He asked if they had combo meals...hehehe. I ordered the Banh Mi hot dog and the angry kimchi fries with a soda. My total came to $12 and change. He ordered the buckeye dog and the Euro Special fries. The place was packed so there was a little wait time for our food. The portions for the fries were huge. I could have ordered the fries alone and still not been able to finish. The banh mi hot dog was flavorful, but not enough to make it worth the $5 I paid for it. I've had hot dogs of equal taste at Sonic or Weinerschnitzel. My friend concurred on his hot dog as well. The fries however stole the show! The Angry Kimchi fries were packed with huge flavors, and just when I thought I had tasted it all, a new texture or spiciness punched me in the mouth. I thought the jalapenos were fresh and zesty. The kimchi was heated yet still maintained the crunchy veggie texture that I love. The sweet potato fries were salty, sweet and crunchy. The melted cheese sort of calmed the dish down, yet infused a nice melted gooeyness into it. The bulgogi was tender and mildly spicy. All together I loved the fries and will most definitely order them again. My friend's Euro Fries were also scrumptious. The pork belly combined with the garlic mayo was a perfect blend of fry toppings. I'll be back for the fries no doubt. Oh, and the service was top notch!",

The fries were also frozen fries but the toppings made up for them. The service is very friendly and we will defiantly be back ordering less food because we ordered way to much the first time around.About $24 for two dogs fries pickles and a drink.",

    "text": "I heard about Buldogis a few weeks back and had been meaning to give it a try.  It sounded interesting.  I am not the biggest fan of hot dogs in general but a fusion hot dog, that is another story.  So I stopped in this last weekend.  I was mostly impressed.  I ordered a bulgogi dog after standing in line for a few minutes.  Usually I avoid standing in lines unless I am familiar with the place and love it so much.  But I had driven all that way and everything on the menu sounded good.  Besides, standing in line afforded me the time to decide which of the many hot dog creations I wanted to try.  As I mentioned before, I settled on the bulgogi dog.  I was not really sure what to expect.  What I got would have exceded any expectations I may have had had I gone in with any expectations.  What I got was friendly service, surprisingly good food and freshness.  I was impressed.  The all beef dog seemed more like a sausage.  It was plump and full of flavor.  Flavor of the good kind.  It taste like meat.  Not parts.  The beef on top was very tender and slightly sweet the way I know bulgogi to be.  For $4.95, not a bad deal.  Very fair.  Cheaper than Pinks.  I think I will be back someday.  Perhaps I should try a different dog.  They all look so good.",

    "text": "If there was one good thing provided by the Las Vegas recession (which still appears to have no end in sight) it's this: more mom and pop/neighborhood food places. For years it seemed like the only option there really was for cheap and quick meals in neighborhoods were fast food chains you could find anywhere else. Thank god people have finally started \"demanding\" not so hoity-toity places and the supply is rolling in. Buldogis is one of the latest additions to what's possibly the first local trend or \"Las Vegas reinvention\" in 10 years that's actually doing some good in my humble opinion.  The prices may throw one for a loop at first. I can testify to that. $5 for a hot dog is not my cup of tea, thankfully, there were pictures on display all over the restaurant. When it comes to hot dogs, I usually need at least two to fill me up. These didn't look like your ordinary hot dogs, at all, so I figured one would suffice. Wise choice on my behalf.   I didn't want to get something TOO wild, it was only my first time here after all. I ordered a naked dog with caramelized onions, pork belly bacon, cheese and mustard with classic fries and a drink. Total: 8.86. Not bad.   I was given a small sample cup of their chili while waiting for my food. It was courtesy of the chef since it was my first time here. At this point I was already beginning to fall in love with the place. The chili didn't have any beans, but it had a sweet taste sensation to complement the spiciness, so despite the fact it was bean-less, I was impressed. I already know what I'm going to order next time I visit.   I automatically knew I was getting my money's worth when I saw just how big the meal was. Looking at the hot dog by itself, it's already officially the fourth best hot dog I have ever had (authentic Chicago-style, authentic NYC style and the hot dogs I used to get at the Gold Coast bowling alley all the time as a young'n are the only ones which were better). That hot dog with the toppings gave my taste buds an explosion of unique flavors I was not at all used to on the token \"mystery meat\" (which in the case of this restaurant is 100% beef, so what's in the hot dog isn't a mystery here). The mustard was a little bit too much, which is my fault as I was hesitant about adding that in the first place, not at all theirs. Otherwise, I was quite impressed. The fries were divine, with parmesan cheese, garlic and seasoning salt.  The ambiance of the place does not match the \"gourmet\" in it's title at all, which, again, in my humble out of the ordinary opinion is a good thing. It's a very home-y place, it already looks and feels like it's been a local staple for years and the staff is very down to Earth, helpful and friendly. It's location is unfortunate though, not only is Village Square basically dying but it's in that corner building next to Chicago Brewery which faces away from the street, a building which doesn't have a good track record with businesses at all. That said, all of the rave reviews it has been getting here on Yelp and in various local periodicals make me optimistic for this place.   The Final Verdict (something new I'm trying out for my reviews):  Pros: Cheap considering what you get. Creative and experimental. Pretty damn good hot dogs. One hot dog can fill you up pretty well. Down to Earth ambiance.  Cons: The dying shopping center it's located in.  It seems like they use mayo all over the place. Yuck.   Suggestions: Using the term \"gourmet\" in the name of the place is rather off-putting. It's not expensive, and it's far from pretentious. Buldogi's Quirky Hot Dogs would probably work better and be more reflective of the food and ambiance.  Would I return? Absolutely.",

The bun of my  bulgogi dog fell apart because there was so much meat on it, so I ended up eating it with a fork and a knife.  I jokingly said told the waitress about it when she asked me how my food was.  I didn't mind the bun falling apart really, but she insisted that she would bring me another one, but there was no way I was going to eat it because I was full.  So instead she gave me some bread pudding to go, which was super nice of her.  They went totally out of the way to make sure we were happy.",

My Angry Kimchi Dog was fantastic and had generous amounts of bulgogi and kimchi sitting on top of the actual hotdog.  Party in my mouth.    Fun atmosphere and helpful staff = enjoyable dining experience.  Everything on the menu is under $5.  Portions are generous but everything is so yummy that it's not hard to eat everything yourself.  :)",

The cashier was very helpful, pointing out the favorites, explaining some of the items to us.  We ordered the Bulgogi dog, Gangnam dog, Angry dog and Euro fries. When the cashier brought our order, I couldn't believe my eyes! Fries' portion was huge! Like the others mentioned the Bulgogi was tender and plentiful. Hot dogs interesting and flavorful.  What prompted me to write this review was because of the presentation of the hotdogs. 9.9 out of 10 times at fast food places, the food is just thrown together, but the skillful chef Raymond, artfully assembled the hotdogs. It's almost as if he was serving it in a five-star hotel on the strip. The cashier Travante (sp?) said the owner told them that the eyes eat first. That is absolutely right! And what the owner said was one thing, but for the employees to follow through was another. Two thumbs up for Travante and Raymond!",

It was a little further of a drive than I had expected, but it was a drive that I was happy to make.    I ordered the Banh Mi Dog and the Angry Kimchi Fries.  I thought that the Banh Mi Dog was phenomenal, but was a little disappointed with the angry fries.  They were not spicy at all and just had an overall blandness to them which surprised me given how many ingredients were in there.  The Banh Mi Dog was probably the greatest hot dog I ever had though.  The dog itself was so incredibly juicy and perfectly cooked.  The topping around it just complemented it and I wolfed that thing down as if the world was about to end.  I think if I could do it all over again I would try the Euro Fries instead of the angry fries.  It may just be that I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries.    The service was also top notch.  The staff was incredibly polite and they made sure to check in with each person dining as well as wishing them well on the way out.  I like places that give a nice personal touch like that.  I would give this a solid 4.5 stars, but since you can't do that I'll round up due to the service provided by the staff.    This place is definitely a worthwhile visit if you're hankerin' for a great hot dog!",

I tried the Banh Mi hotdog, the Bulgogi hotdog, and the spicy kimchi fries. Not only are the toppings delicious, but the franks are also perfectly seasoned and grilled. The bulgogi was some of the best I've had. Also, the Banh Mi hotdog had crispy pork belly bits, which added insane flavor and texture to every bite. Lastly, the fries were very solid. It's not the best fries I've ever had, but it still tastes great. Would I come back? Hell yeah. It's no wonder this place is decorated with tons of articles featuring it.  Interesting note: this place seems to be run by a black community. Perhaps they're part Korean? Very cool nonetheless.",

The food is amazingly different that we have encouraged the manager to talk to the owner about opening a shop in San Diego. I couldn't eat just one hot dog -- had to go for another. Together we had the angry dog, smoked dog, Chicago dog, and the Hawaiian dog along with the Euro fries ... All yummy!!",

I got the off the menu hot dog that was named me - the Gang Nam Dog (hot dog, roasted pork belly, sliced cucumber, nori flakes, green onions, sesame seeds, Korean chili sauce). It tasted fantastic! Also tried a friend's Hawaiian Dog (hot dog, pork belly, pineapple salsa, g-onions, honey Dijon mustard), which had a nice welcomed slight sweetness from the pineapple and honey mustard. The Euro Special fries (pork belly bacon, cheddar cheese, herb blend, garlic mayo, fries) and the Carne Asada fries (beef bulgogi, 5 cheese blend. pico de gallo, diced jalapeno, chipotle mayo, avocado mayo, fries) were bomb with the carne asada one being more flavorful. One of my friend is a regular here so they hooked us all up with free drinks. Checking in on Yelp gets you a 10% discount. Staff are really friendly and helpful. The food here is way better than most of the overpriced stuff that you find on the strip. A definitely good Vegas stop.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of friends for a going-away party and had a pleasant time.  I've been hearing great things about this place so I was definitely looking forward to trying this place out.  Here's my breakdown:  PROS:   -Great customer service: as soon I walked in, there was a long line, but I was still greeted very well by the staff behind the counter.  When it was my turn, the cashier lady was very welcoming and explained very well what each item was.  She also came to our table often to ask how the food was, or if there was anything that we needed.  -Price: you can't beat the cheap price.  For ~$5, you can be enjoying a gourmet hotdog with various toppings and sauces.  -Food quality: I ordered the Hawaiian dog, which was a beef hotdog, topped with pineapple, pork belly, some-kind of delicious sauce I can't remember the name, and scallions.  I enjoyed it very much and it was gone in 5 minutes.  The pineapples were sweet, which contrasted great with the sauce and scallions.  I would, however, say the pork-belly was a little underwhelming.  It was a little bitter, but overall, didn't take away from the experience.  CONS:  -None.  Can you believe that? I don't.  Maybe because I was so hungry, I wasn't thinking about anything but the food.  Like I mentioned, I had a pleasant time and I look forward to coming back.",

    "text": "(Originally saved sometime in December 2011... apparently I never posted it)  I always say that I'll eventually get to writing all the reviews to places that I have eaten so that I can one day just be recognized by the legions of yelp-goers for being \"that guy\" on yelp... Sadly I have not and this is where the sarcasm ends. However, for every review that I do put on yelp I stand by it completely, if only because I (like many of y'all) am a big foodie at heart (a certain somebody that overdoes it on yelp would disagree with me though)...  ... but all this brings me to my current review. I was brought over to this place from the multitude of repeated check-ins of a good buddy of mine. When he first described this place to me, I stupidly responded, \"What, you mean the place that used to be a Quiznos?\" ... after a short argument about the validity of life, we were here! They still had the Quizno's \"OPEN\" sign at the time too, which was great.  The atmosphere inside this place feels more like a quick lunch hotspot more than anything else, which is both very quaint and very relaxing. The service inside is nice, friendly, and very homely. Most importantly, the bathroom is very clean. Judge me how you will, but a messy bathroom is not a good place to be.  After deciding on what to order (I got two specialized dogs while my buddy got the \"Angry Kimchi Fries\") and it arrived at the table, honestly I was surprised. The hotdog bun is normal, something you can probably get at a supermarket, but that's about as far as \"normal\" goes. These things were HUGE; if I had to imagine it way bigger than my stomach was supposed to probably handle on a normal lunch.  The feeling you get when you bite into something that's delicious is indescribable (picture Ratatouille description of 'flavors' and you'll get the general idea of it), but their Bulgogi Dog was amazing. The mix of flavors from the hotdog to the beef on top created a nice mixture of tang and salt that makes you crave for more, where the Hawaiian Dog infuses enough sweetness to say \"Mmmm...\" This place is one of the few times that describing flavors would fail me, as there's just enough on the menu for everybody. And those Angry Kimchi Fries? In a nutshell, it's sweet potatoes + kimchi + bulgogi + spiciness pretty much all blended together into an amazing complement.  To anybody in the area? I would say \"go eat there, you can't go wrong.",

    "text": "Short version: really truly awesome food, but be prepared to wait for it. I spent 45 minutes waiting on fries, and another 10 waiting for my hot dog. But then once I got them, I really didn't mind... If they'd had better/faster service, this place would be a 5-star slam dunk.  Came here for lunch with 4 other people from work, and we weren't in a hurry but we weren't out to spend 3 hours eating lunch. The place wasn't very busy, another party of 6 was there and some were already eating, and a party of 3 that was getting an order for takeout had just ordered and left to return later. We were the only people that needed helping, but unfortunately it took us 5 minutes of standing at the counter to get waited on, and ordering was a slight hassle since the guy at the register was a cook, and trying to make food while running the counter and answering the phone.  There were two guys working, and it seemed like they cooked exactly one thing at a time instead of many things at a time. When our food came to the table they came out of order from how we'd been in line and ordered them, and they came out one at a time. It was about 20 minutes from the first dish coming out (my fries, which I ordered second) to the last dish coming out (my buddy's hot dog, which he'd ordered last). The guy who ordered first got his food second-to-last. It doesn't make any sense...  I got the Eurofries and an Angry Dog. The Angry Dog was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't even close. Do not fear the Angry Dog. That said, it was really really good. The Eurofries were also really good. The fries were very well cooked, the dog was very well cooked, the seasoning and flavors were awesome except for the jalapenos on top of the angry dog. I've had some jalapenos that really punch me in the face, but these had absolutely no flavor or heat at all.   Don't take that to mean the Angry Dog wasn't good. I just skipped the jalapenos and everything else it came with was great. I have not a single thing bad to say about the Eurofries.   From a healthiness standpoint, this place isn't going to win any awards. I mean, it's a fried hot dog and fries covered in sauces. But the quality of the meats were pretty dang good, especially for the price. No gristle, tender, good flavor, very well cooked...  I'll definitely be coming back here every now and then, when I am in the mood to not care about what I eat and just eat something delicious, and when I'm not in a hurry.",

Or maybe I just don't know about the hotdog places here in San Jose. Well maybe I don't know about the places here because it isn't all that great.....  Anyways, this place has some pretty good fused hotdogs. I ordered the beef bulgogi hotdog which was pretty much what it sounds; beef bulgogi, asian slaw, grilled onions, sesame seeds, and bulgogi mayo; I also added some cold kimchi to add a kick to my dog. My hotdog turned out yummy as hell, also it was pretty damn fulfilling. I also had a bite of my sisters hot dog, the dog of the week (dragon dog, with dragon sauce) that hotdog was one of the besterestest I've ever had, their dragon sauce was banging. I will definitely come back here for more and most likely try something different.",

I had some co workers bring me the food back as i was unable to leave the office for lunch.     O.M.G.   The dogs and fries were OUTSTANDING.     I had 2 varieties of the dogs for my first try.     Turkey Dog :  5 Cheese Blend , Carmalized Onions ( oh my ) corn relish , roasted garlic mustard.    This was the first of the 2 i was able to try and it was very good.  The turkey dog had very good flavor , the cheese and corn relish along with the caramelized onions worked well.  I though the mustard was a little overpowering , but im not a huge mustard fan .  Next time i will probably go a little lighter on the mustard.   Smoked Dog : Spicy Link , Caramelized Onions Slaw , Cheddar Cheese and GARLIC MAYO!.  As you can guess i really enjoyed the Garlic Mayo on this dog.  It was a perfect mixture of spicy to salty to  YUM!.  I have nothing to say about this at all , and will definitely be repeating again !   Classic Fries :  The best part .. they were still crunchy when i got them back to my office.  That is something i never get!.  The seasoning was not over powering and was just perfect...  Definitly worth it.   All in all i quite enjoyed my meal , and would probably more if i was able to eat onsite.   Definitely will be back !",

OMG!!!!!! We ordered the Chicago,Bahn mi,Buckeye and Bulgogi dogs. Mickayla took our order and recommended that the dogs be cut in half and served in to go boxes, which made sense for us.  We also ordered the Euro Fries and the Carne Asada Fries. Mickayla brought our food outside to us and we checked out all of the food. As you can see by the pics it all looked amazing. Lori tried the Bahn Mi which has pork belly onions and a Sriracha mayo. She couldn't stop raving about it.  I tried the Bulgogi, I can't describe how good it was. The Carne Asada Fries were awesome, I can't believe that I have never been here before. We will definitely be back.  The service was great. If Mickayla is working, she will be glad to help you in your decision of what to have. While we were eating outside one of the cooks walked out and he suggested that we take the fries and make skillet breakfast by chopping up the leftover fries and add eggs. I'm already looking forward to breakfast tomorrow.  This place is one of those small hole in the wall joints that you hope always stay that way. Unbelievable food and service. We are definitely coming back.",

Gourmet hot dog joints seem to be popping up all over Vegas at a growing rate, and sometimes it's a bit hard to pick the winners from the overhyped. No doubt about it though, this one is 100% the former.   Went in with my buddy Alex for a late lunch around 4-5pm. Tucked away in one of the many, many, many strip malls of the burbs, the place was empty save for one other group of people sitting at the table next to us, and one person who came to pick up an order. I had a Santa Fe dog, Alex had an Angry, and we split an order of Euro Fries. I actually had a difficult time getting around to the the dog because I instantly fell in love with the garlic mayo and pork bellies they used. Having said that, the Santa Fe dog was incredible; the chili they used really sank into the rest of the ingredients, making it the king of hot dog you want to take your full 40 chews per bite on. We found out that they put a second Buldogis inside of MVP, which is much closer to us, so that will definitely be a future haunt!",

    "text": "I now know why the chili cheese fries were more than the hot dog.  Maybe they should offer half orders of it?  They should also take down the user pics that show the cc fries are $2.95.  My review of the items scale = 1-10 Smokey Dog - 7: It was definitely smokey, but it says it's a spicy link and it wasn't very spicy.  My personal preference is for the condiments to be on the bun and the meant and things like onions, slaw, cheese to be on top.  Overall it was a pretty tasty dog.  Had a good snap.  $4.95 is a pretty good price. Chili Cheese Fries - 7: big size, good flavor, just wish they had a 1/2 order since I was flying solo. Soda - 7:  Not a Pepsi or Pepsi product fan.  Had the orange crush, would have preferred coke.  Maybe Yelp should list whether the establishment is Coke, Pepsi, or Other.  Overall pretty decent.  They also have burgers and other items added.  The pictures of the burgers looked pretty good.  It's been my experience that when a restaurant adds things outside of their normal menu, it's a sign of distress.  I might be wrong on this as I am always rooting for the small guy.  If they add breakfast, then, Taps may not be too far behind.  The addition of lunch specials may not be a bad idea and maybe just regular plane jane dogs with kraut, spicy mustard, onions etc.  Who knows.",

    "text": "Returned after many months and the service is just a great as I remember it. The hot dogs are still just as juicy too. The price is perfect. They are generous with things like trying different mayos. Seating is still tight too.  Stick with the fusion dogs. Even an American palate can enjoy the bulgogi dog. The dogs are generously loaded. Most dogs can be vegetarianized, and they have turkey dogs. Try the avocado mayo with fries, so good! A dog and fries is enough for one hungry person.  This restaurant has a lot to compete with now in this plaza which is probably why I'm having thoughts like these: I wish the flavor was more aggressive. Like the caramelized onions should be cooked more. The dogs they say are spicy should be spicier. More dogs should have Korean hot sauce on them. The euro fries need more everything on them or maybe an additional condiment, too many naked fries. I want crazy amounts of seaweed on something. I want to smell sesame seed oil and garlic together. What if something had grilled fish on it!  And one thing that isn't a big deal, the music last time suuuucked. It was like Lilith Fair Pandora. I couldn't shut up about it to my food companion.",

The Korean Meats were not marinated enough and the hamburger patty was a bit dry and needed a little more salt and pepper. The Kim Chee was a bit too sour. The highlight were the jalepeno which was more spicy than the Kim Chee. The service from the staff was efficient and the chef was attentive and friendly. He even gave us a free sample of the kimchee. Has a lot of potential but needs to tweak the recipes a little more.",

    "text": "Dinner for under $7 (and that includes some iced tea) is a super find for me! The dinner happened to be a ginormous pile of sweet potato fries, but they were topped with kimchi, pork, melty cheese and a fried egg. That covers all the major food groups, right?  I wasn't feeling like a dog, but I have been meaning to try the Angry Kimchi Fries for some time now. The description may seem daunting, but if you enjoy all of these ingredients separately, you will definitely enjoy them in orchestrated consumption, which is what makes the dish shine. Who thought of putting all of these treats in one big pile? Genius. I was able to eat every bite with some chopsticks, so don't worry about a mess. As you might suspect, I could have done with more kimchi! (I almost ordered a side.) And perhaps a bit more layering of the cheese, but now I am just being persnickety.   The service was the best you could receive at a casual spot like this. Super friendly at the counter. I was asked by two separate people if everything was okay after I received my basket of fries, and my empty basket was somehow detected and immediately cleared! I even had my back to the counter, but they knew. Spy-like deftness.   For me, the Angry Kimchi Fries were a meal's worth, affordable and tasty. I will definitely head back to sample more creations or just for a round two of fries.",

They have something for everyone; spicy, chili cheese dogs, or a good old fashioned dog with ketchup and mustard.  If you are daring they have a Dragon Kimchi dog challenge. There has been 1 person to complete the challenge successfully and it's me!   You have to eat 3 of there Dragon Kimchi Dogs in 5 minutes. It's not easy but if you finish it it's free.  Their Euro Fries are pretty delicious. The sauce they have on them gives them a good flavor mixed with the bacon and cheese. I tried the Santa Fe Dog last trip and it was pretty good. It is not a hot dog it's a hot link. Adds a different flavor and a little spice other than their normal hot dog.   Caeser is no longer there but they still have good food.",

This place has been on my radar for awhile, so I didn't hesitate trying it on my last trip.  Originally it was just hot dogs, but they've expanded their menu to include rice bowls and other things. There's a giant wall menu you can look at, just don't make it seem like you're staring at the guy eating against the wall.  Banh Mi Dog - Who would've guessed I would order the Vietnamese style dog right? It was topped with Pork Belly and the typical banh mi goodies. I added a fried egg for only 95 cents. The hot dog was big, long, and delicious. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FPxZvs_y-iYK_wALRJeXmMA%2Fl.jpg&s=502421f75cecc616da6d3b283b6aa8e867b294e09929e58412ef77b672bc1d8f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>  The gf and I shared an ordered of fries.

    "text": "So after all the fan fare I made it out here finally.  It takes me about 20 to 30 min to get out here so we were a bit on the late side getting there.  We got there at 20 to 9 and it looked like they were almost cleaned up.  I felt so bad making a mess right before close.  But we were greated with a very nice hello and what can we get you?  No eye rolls or sighs at all!  Nice guys!  So we had 4 people and wanted to cut some in half to sample a few.  We ordered the Beef Bulgogi Dog, the Banh Mi Dog, the West Coast Dog, the Angry Bowl, the Angry Kimchi Fries and the Fried Pickles.  Put it this way we went a bit over board!  But we have heard so much we really wanted a sampling.  The Dogs hmm... I don't eat a whole lot of dogs but WOW, they popped when you bit into them and had a subtle smokey flavor then the fusion on top just kind of set it off!  The cook said they changed the way they make it recently and started to put the sauce on top.  I thought it made it look amazing but also helped hold the toppings on a bit.  The dogs were Great!  The Angry Kimchi Fries were a nice change I enjoyed them, however the BF didn't like the sweet potatoes he would have preffered regular potatoes.  I thought the sweet potatoes were a nice compliment to the spice of the kimchi on top.  The fried pickles sadly I have been ruined for life for fried pickles.  I will never again have the satisfaction of the pickles I had on a trip to the east coast. :(  The batter had good flavor but it was thick on top of the pickle which in turn took away from the flavor of the pickle.  The dipping sauce for it was great!    The decor is nice and bright and made me smile the staff is super nice!  So the verdict is I will come back the BF says he wouldn't drive out there for it but I do the driving so I guess we'll be back!",

Their hot dogs are ok, but I'm not a fan of hot dogs so I can't really give a qualified opinion on their hot dogs. I can, however, tell you that their chicken tenders are the worst I've ever had. They're like elongated chicken nuggets that you can find in the frozen food section of your local supermarket. In fact, I think they probably took it out of the freezer and microwaved it. I'm not sure why they would serve this on their menu, even Dairy Queen has better chicken tenders!   Also, their customer service needs work. The guy who took my order kept looking at the TV behind me the entire time and never made eye contact. Perhaps he thought what was on TV was more interesting than a paying customer. I'm sure other customers have had awkward experiences with the staff there. As I was waiting for my food, a big group of guys came in and had to figure out which tables to put together to form a larger table as the cashier just stood there and stared without offering any help.

Perhaps we are just getting old and can't take it anymore but we had to stop going because it just wasn't worth the tears.  Let me explain more- we basically focused our ordering on things on the menu that have both pork belly and garlic mayonaise- so it could just be the combination of these two ingrediants that is waging a thermo nuclear war on our insides- but damnit those are the best things on the menu- what are we supposed to do eat some vegetables? Not in America chief.   The inside- not very glamorous or inviting- definately a take out style place.",

We ordered 3 hotdogs (naked, Banh Mi, Beef Bulgogi) and a small classic and Euro fries.  Naturally, we had leftover fries but no more sauce.  The board said an order of sauce will cost extra.  When we asked for it and were ready to pay, the guy behind the counter said, \"I'll give it to you for free\".  Mind you, the price is nominal, but the gesture was great customer service.    Don't miss out on this place!",

I had the Angry dog and Euro Special fries and i can not even describe how amazing this place is. Even the aroma when you first walk in is mouthwatering. The Angry Dog was perfection. It was the perfect amount of heat and the spicy mayo was to die for! It kept getting better after each and every bite. The toasted warm bun and the delectable spicy link with Pork belly, amazing spicy mayo and jalapenos all went together so well. The flavors paired together excellently. As for the Euro fries, i was left speechless the warm melted cheese and crisp fries. There is really no way to describe how amazing they were so i recommend you try them out and see. I will definitely comeback here and i hope to try everything on there menu. Well done buldogis. Well done",

Then its topped with teriyaki beef, roasted peppers, and I added caramelized onions.

I had the Southern Dog and Mr Ed had the Chicago Dog and speaking for myself the Southern was a symphony for the taste buds I mean if you truly love hot dogs as I do then Buldogis he has to be on your list of favorites after the first tasting.  To Chef Cesar  you truly have made Hot Dogs Gourmet. This was my first visit but most definitely not my last visit I will definitely become a regular fixture at Buldogis.

When i ate here i was actually excited to try this new spot based off the reviews of others and went straight for the angry fries of course and then a small Bulkogi bowl. The angry fries looked like an angry mess, i like the sunnyside up egg on top and i like the kimchi but the sweet potato fries and cheese etc just all became a soggy mess and i was kind of meh about it all. My Bulkogi bowl was so salty... i mean way way too salty. i think it was an overkill of soy sauce or something because i was struggling to finish it all. Too heavy in the green onions as well and the worst part of it was the amount gristle i had to chew through in such a small portion of meat. Every bite i had of this bowl had a small hard piece of gristle in my meat making it difficult to enjoy. The best part of my meal was the sweetened tea that they had on tap that was certainly needed because of my heavily salty meal. Maybe i should have ordered a hotdog but my brother said they were just \"ok\" so i went with something thats hard to mess up in a rice bowl, and that might have been my mistake. Ill probably not return, but on a positive note that maybe one less in line the followers have to wait on so they can get their food.",

I gravitate towards their banh mi hot dog and their euro special house fries, while my husband will try a whole bunch of things there, and especially loves their chili. We've come rather later some nights when they've already turned off the stove, but the workers are always kind and offer to turn them back on. I feel like the owner (or maybe he's the manager) has always done something out of his way when we are here to make us feel welcome. Their great customer service and reliable food options will keep us loyal to this Vegas institution.",

The hotdogs with the toppings was an 8/10. The wiener itself, a 3.  The shop is small, clean, simple and you order at the counter. Friendly staff and a convenient location- right near Boca Park and Tivoli Village!  I definitely need to make another trip back to try their fries!  Buldogis was in Oprah magazine!",

The Chef was super helpful as we explored the menu and made our selections. I chose to go the non-spicy route and Chef kindly offered to customize to meet my needs. My wife decided to take the extra spicy route and the result, balanced perfectly!  Angry kimchee fries are now our new meal of choice. Getting some extra sauce for extra angriness was definitely a positive move. The sauce is so freaking good we got a small container to go! If only it was available bottled, we'd take it home on the plane and start a Buldogi fan club in Florida!  There were plenty of families there with young kiddies who enjoyed some of the dog statues / decor. The items were at perfect kiddo height so they were petting the pretend dogs and really enjoying themselves while their parents scarfed down demented kimchee bulgogi garlic bacon hot dog concoctions!   We can't wait to return!",

It was just good.   The chilli fries meat tasted like a sloppy joes, sweet and not my thing.  I wished it tasted like chilly with cheyenne pepper, black pepper, chopped onions and paprika.  It was enough for two but I would pass on this dish. My girlfriend bought the bulgogi hot dog and she said it was bland.  Prices were reasonable and portions are great.

What makes this place even better is the staff.  Chelsea was great, and the cook (didn't get his name) were both super-friendly and attentive.  We were greeted when we walked in the door and welcomed to come back when we left.  Excellent food and excellent service.  I can't wait to go back....soon!",

Halfway through the Buckeye my eating partner announced that we have to come back this week!   I'm not a huge fan of hotdogs. They just taste like hotdogs to me. But this Banh Mi dog succeeded in bringing flavor and uniqueness to what would otherwise be a boring hotdog.  I especially enjoyed the cucumbers.   The fries were hot and fresh. The seasoning blend is light and almost imperceptible. I got a side of garlic aioli for fry dipping. The aioli was different than what I've had before. This one had a mustard flavor in addition to it. I wasn't a fan and won't be spending $0.75 again.   There are so many other dogs that I would love to try. So I'll definitely be back, maybe this week!",

We had a large order: 3 angry dogs, 1 bulgogi dog, 1 mac & cheese dog, 3 fries with mac & cheese added, and 1 side of mac & cheese.  Everything came out in a timely fashion and packed well. The mac & cheese side was pretty good.   The hot dogs didn't live up to the photos and hype, maybe that was our fault for setting our expectations too high.  I understand that it's fusion and I'm all for it, but the flavors didn't seem to blend well. I was hoping for the coleslaw and kim chi to be cold and crunchy, but they were just hot and soggy.   The person behind us recommended the carne asada fries, which we may try if we're ever back on that side of town.",

The angry kimchi was definitely spicy and the Gangnam was my favorite. This is a fusion hot dog place that was once a food truck. The employees were kind and the food was great. There is also a vegetarian menu there for the non meat eaters.   We tried to do an online order but it didn't work (slightly inconvenient), and to be honest, I was wishing the spicy Korean sauce for the wings was actually spicy. It was less of a gochujang sauce and more like a sweet chili sauce. This is surprising since the angry kimchi was actually very spicy and I liked it. Also, not a big fan of the wedge cut fries that come with the wings.   Other than that, the food was great and I'll definitely be back to grab some some dogs and try some loaded fries in the future.",

    "text": "This place is phenomenal. I'm never disappointed when I get food from these folks.  I live right around the corner from this location and it's difficult not to end up here every day. The food is awesome, the service is amazing, and the location is great.  Let's start with the food: I consistently get the Euro Fries. They are absolute to die for, the solo that they put over top mixed with the great flavor of the pork belly makes these a sure fire hit. I'm a bit of a creature of habit when it comes to this place. I almost always get the Carne Asada dog or the Philly Dog. The way that they cook their hot dogs (deep fried) makes the outer casing crisp and crunchy while still preserving the flavor inside the casing. Their bread and butter are the sauces that they put over the dogs though. Good lord, they are absolutely unreal. I'm salivating just thinking about them.  Next, the service. The gentleman that is the head chef at this location almost always is the one that rings me out and takes my order. The awesome thing about that is he remembers the particulars of my order from my previous trip. It's absolutely unreal, he has the most amazing memory. The funny part is that the meal is so heavy (but amazing) that I try and only go there once every couple months. Trust me, if I didn't have stomach issues, if be there weekly.  This place is hands down one of the best spots in Vegas. I love food and I love finding little dives that are in hidden pockets of Vegas. I never have an issue recommending this place because I KNOW that whatever they get, they'll love.",

    "text": "One of the things I miss most from Chicago are Gourmet Hot Dogs Done Right. Buldogis goes a long, long way to filling that void.  I've had 4 or 5 different dogs from them now, and every one of them has been phenomenal. If you are a former Chicagoan like me who was weaned on Hot Dougs and Frank's n' Dawgs, be warned that all the dogs are a \"normal\" Hot dog base. No elk sausage fanciness here; all the goodness is in the toppings. (match your expectations to your venue, yelp)  Similarly to Komex, Buldogis soars in the realms of contrast and texture. Salty crunchy crispy sweet meaty gooey juicey...all of these are combined and woven across the various dogs into a palette of beefy deliciousness. Every dog tastes different, and wonderful. You can get a filling meal for under $10, and there's a huge variety. I think I actually slightly prefer the Bahn Mi over the Buldogi...but both are lip smackin'.  The owner (I think?) has been the one to help us on more than a few occasions, same guy, at any rate, and he is the nicest person. The first time we'd stopped in, we had planned on getting takeout, since we had the dog in the car, when we noticed they had a patio. Checked with the fellow behind the counter to make sure it would be okay if we stayed, and he brought our pup out a free mini hot dog and a little cup of water. Which was pretty awesome. (our dog is a corgi, so there were dog sausage cannibal jokes to be had)  Pros; - Great food, people, price, and variety. - Fried. Pickles.  - Easy parking, easy to reach off strip location. - Dog friendly staff and patio. - Probably a great place to bring a kid, especially one who's a little bit adventurous food wise.  Cons; - Sort of a little restaurant, so probably not great for a group. - It's not fast food, and if it's busy and you didn't call ahead, your order might take a few minutes. Definitely worth waiting for, but something to plan ahead.",

Even though I've only been once before, the owner remembered and welcomed me back; that's always nice!  I had the beef bulgogi dog, and we also tried the beer battered fried pickles and classic fries.  Part of the fun of eating here is watching everyone try to fit their loaded dog into their mouth and all the toppings falling into a pile.  It's messy and finger licking good.  The beef bulgogi dog was excellent.  It had korean bulgogi style beef on top with green onions, sesame seeds and a zingy mayo.  Yum!  The fried pickles were probably the best version I've ever had.  The gave us a zesty east coast mayo for dipping.  The fries were crisp and seasoned and we got bloody mary ketchup and bbq ketchup to spruce them up.  They have loads of fun flavor of mayo and ketchup which you can sample for just 25 cents a piece.    The hot dogs themselves are excellent and you can build your own if you are apprehensive about international toppings.  They are plump and juicy and all beef goodness.  My dad had a traditional chicago style dog and loved it.  They also have favorites like a chilli cheese dog, corn dog and so on.    The prices are super reasonable.  I fed all three of us, with drinks, for $23.  Try this place with for a delicious and creative twist on an old favorite.",

And I love the island/Hawaiian music; nice touch!  We tried the ANGRY DOG (spicy pork bulgogi, Asian slaw, sliced jalapeno, fiery mayo), BANH MI DOG (pork belly, banh mi slaw, herb blend, sriracha mayo), CORN DOG, ANGRY KIMCHI FRIES (sweet potato fries, kimchi, spicy pork bulgogi, five cheese blend, fried sunny side-up egg, green onions, diced jalapeno), and CLASSIC FRIES (Buldogis special blend seasoning). We both LOVED the gourmet hot dogs!! Very, very delicious. The mayos were yummy, the slaws were refreshing, and the dog itself was delicious with the right crunch of the casing. Yum, yum, yum. The Angry Kimchi Fries were good, but it didn't stand out. The kimchi was bland and none of the ingredients were bursting with flavors like I was expecting. The Classic Fries were disappointing as well, nothing special about that special seasoning blend. The corn dog was fresh, had a great cornbread exterior with a nice bite, however, it didn't taste any differently from, or better than, all the other corn dogs I've eaten before.  Even though a lot of the items I had today struck out, the main event items (hot dogs!!) were home runs, so four stars and I'm coming back!",

All that comes to mind when I eat at Buldogis is \"DAYUM DAYUM DAYYYYYYYYUM!!!\" Youtube Five Guys Burger Review if you don't get the reference.   To give you an idea of how AWESOME this place is: I, a cheap Asian male, tipped this place roughly 23% for the experience I had. My last visit, I came with my girlfriend's family for lunch. We ordered Angry Dogs and the Bulgogi Dog (not sure if that's what it's called, but that's basically what it is) with Euro Fries and Angry Fries to share. Mere words can not describe the delicious taste of the dogs and Angry Fries. The Euro Fries came pretty salty, but that's just something I'll avoid next time.   The magic here though, is the service. Every time I come in, I'm always served by the Head Chef. To anyone who doesn't actually know where the management lies, would easily be deceived into believing that Head Chef Cesar is the owner because of the amount of care he puts into the customers. During my visit, the chef messed up my order and served us an order of sweet potato fries that we did not order. We kindly told him that we did not order a side of sweet potato Angry fries, but he gave it to us anyways! Our party and another table were always checked on during our meal.  I just can not express my love for Buldogis.",

The prices may seem high for a hot dog and I slightly agree. But I can't complain too much because the hot dogs themselves are premium and the fixins aren't your typical toppings. They are meals themselves! We also had the Carne Asada Fries. Delicious! And once again, generous on the toppings! This is one of those unique places to bring visiting friends and family. My boyz are already asking when we're going back. Especially the one who had the Mac and cheese dog! This was close to being 5 stars because the uniqueness of the place and the really good food.

The angry dog dog was good also, but I would have liked a little more seasoning on the spicy pork on top.  The fresh jalapeno was a nice touch but might have overpowered the pork and dog a little, which is the focus, still a overall good dog.  I would definitely be returning to try other dogs.",

If you're in the mood for some hotdogs, this place is the place.  I ended up going a second time. This time, I tried the Banh mi dog: dog + bulgogi + picked veggies like a vietnamese sando. Delicious!! My friend got their special: Gangnam Dog: I forget what's on it, but it had nori on it. I wish I saw that one first or else I would've gotten it. The owner was attentive again! Came out bringing us extra napkins, checking on our experience thrice. Anyway, Highly recommend this place! Try it out!",

Everything from the Bib im bop to angry dogs...all the food is top notch (at a way way too reasonable price). This guys done a great fusion between Korean, American Mexican and god knows what else. ......I highly recommend anything they serve that has pork belly on it, especially the euro fries... oh man the euro fries..don't even get me started. I also have to tip my hat to the owner, somehow I always end up chatting with this guy when I come in. This guy is a super super nice, all around salt of the earth kind of guy. Hes super honest, he works more hours than anyone would care to admit, works his a** off to keep this place running and do all the prep work for his new food truck  from his restaurant while operating active food service . Definitely a restaurant I want to support just in that, this is a case of the little guy (non corporate) private owner busting his hump to make it work. If you are into supporting local food, local business, and have any kind of understanding of how hard the food industry is to stay afloat in you should check this place out. Seriously, BRAVO food well done, hats off and any other accolade I can pass on!! Thank you for the continuously awesome food!",

In less than two weeks, my family and I have been there twice and are already talking about what we will try next time.  During our first visit, we tried the Bulgogi Dog, Hawaiian Dog, Puppy Dog and Euro Special Fries.  All were fantastic!  Looking at the ingredients on both the fries and hot dogs can be overwhelming, but trust that the man behind the counter will not do you wrong.  Every flavor component is artfully selected and carefully applied.  Tonight, I tried the Buckeye Dog and my husband had the Southern Dog.  Again, just fantastic.  You must try them!  Not only is the food amazing, but you cannot beat the prices especially when you consider the quality of the ingredients.  All of the ingredients are top notch and super fresh.  Finally, the people at this restaurant are so nice!  I accidentally ordered the wrong hot dog for my husband, and when it came it looked so fantastic that he was absolutely content to eat it.  The server overheard us and quickly replaced the hot dog with the one he really wanted to try at no extra charge.  Tonight, the chef not only remembered my husband, but also what he ordered.  This restaurant is exactly what it claims (and then some) - gourmet hot dogs.  You must try it!",

Buldogis looked like they were about to be added to my favorite hot dog joints especially after looking through all the pictures and reading the reviews. I came in yesterday with my boyfriend and we were sooooo excited to finally try it out! He got the Angry dog and I got the Banh Mi dog since they seemed to be the most popular on Yelp, and we decided on the Kimchee fries. Okay, it was our mistake for getting kimchee fries when neither of us like kimchee lol, idk why we ordered that when we should've got the Euro or the Cane Asada fries.. So these fries don't affect this review, I will only write about the hot dogs.   Okay what we both noticed was that they looked BOMB.COM they were super loaded like we love. BUT it was so loaded that the sauces were only on the toppings, which kinda took some taste away from the whole hot dog. The second immediate thing we noticed that the buns were super cold... So cold that it made the whole hot dog feel cold.. So although it looks like there's a lot on it, somehow there was still something missing, and the cold buns just were not good... Weve honestly had better gourmet hot dogs than this.. :(   Prices were GREAT! Cheaper than anticipated, plus the place it cute and clean. Wish I could give 3.5 stars",

Now I might be picky, but for a place that provides great tasting FRESH ingredients on the hot dogs and carne asada fries - I watched the employee take the breaded pickles out of the freezer, out of the store bought bag and place them in the fryer. Now I will say the fried pickle spears are tasty - BUT - you guys can do better - make them fresh. Make some awesome breading and put your own mark on those pickles. That said I will be back great tasting food.   Employee that greeted us was very friendly and outgoing.  Now the place did smell a bit greasy - I'm hoping that's why the contractor was there looking at the vent hoods Very enjoyable food. One star deduction for the frozen fried pickle spears.",

But I had to go with a hot dog, since ya know, it's a hot dog place. And, of course, there was no way I could pass up fries. Frankly, I don't how I made it out there without ordering like 18 different items. Seriously tough choices. I went with the Angry Dog (spicy and with an Asian twist) and Carne Asada Fries (loaded with toppings!).  They were pretty busy, so I had a to wait for my order for a bit. But it wasn't more than 15 minutes. The order was brought to me and I was checked on a couple of times. Not at all what I would have expected from a quick, casual, order-at-the-counter establishment. Very good service.  The food was fabulous. Tasty tasty tasty! And there is definitely no skimping on the toppings here. Both the hot dog and fries were loaded up with tons of toppings - just how I like it.   Definitely crave-worthy. Definitely somewhere I will visit again and again.",

I had the Angry, Spicy Pork Bulgogi hot dog.  Wasn't too spicy.  Apparently, they weren't too angry today.  LoL  Liked the overall flavor.  Spicy pork is a weakness of mine.  Wifey got spicy pork as well, except the bibimbap version.  Portion size is huge!  Tons of pork!  I would gobble this bowl up!  In fact, it was too much for my wife so I helped her clean up!  Who doesn't love chicken wings?  Soy Caramel chicken wings piqued my curiosity.  Soy caramel wings, it is!  At first, didn't think it was a winning combo, but it is an acquired taste and I quickly warmed up to them!  At the very least, these are interesting wings!  There are other gourmet hot dog joints in Vegas to try but certainly add here to the rotation!",

    "text": "Decided to try them for the first time and here are my positives and negatives   Positives:  flavor of the bulgogi hot dog was spot on. Also the fries were cooked to perfection.  The negatives:  before serving me my dog they had it sitting on the counter so long that the bulgogi on top was ice cold yet the hotdog was still nice and warm.  With the temperature difference in the two meats it was not enjoyable.   As far as the Euro Fries I think their Garlic is to over powering causing you to not recognize the taste of potato or the bacon even.  Also they do not layer it so everything is just thrown in top causing mostly bare fries do to the extremely large portion size.  A weaker garlic and they would be perfect.    They noticed me blogging about my order and offered to make me another dog for free.  I accepted another dog but I paid for it still cause I insisted.  My review of the second dog is on the gang nam in which they totally redeemed themselves.  Flavors spot on and nice and hot.  Fantastic dog.   I would have over looked the garlic on the fries and given 5 stars if it wasn't for the first dog.    After the fact I shared my results with the manager on duty and my suggestions and opinions were very welcomed.  I also want to point out that even though they offered to buy the second dog I refused and paid for it myself so I can claim that everything was True to my opinion and not altered due to offers of free food.",

    "text": "Over priced - terrible service - BLAND AS HELL!  Want to pay $10 for a hot dog that looks picturesque but doesn't taste like anything?  Prefer when cashiers easdrop inappropriately then ignore your questions?  Want a plate that barely fits an over stuffed hotdogs so all the toppings fall off onto a dirty table?  Then this is the place for you!   I came here for the first time on the evening of 8/22 with appropriately high expectations and honestly, there were enough red flags in the first few mins that should have caused me to walk right out but I was curious and hungry.  Unfortunately this experience RUINED my night. Let me break it down: Customer Service - there were 2 young guys working that night, a cashier and a cook. Neither could muster enough gusto to answer our questions, make any recommendations or even speak to us by the end of our visit.  The most offensive partwas the super enthusiastic \"good bye\" they said to the couple that left after we arrived. Once we finished our meal, one guy was sweeping up the floor while the other guy was fiddling around behind the counter. I asked the guy behind the coubter for a togo box and he straight ignored me.  The guy sweeping the floor had to yell at him to get his attention give me a togo container which he slowly handed over without saying a single word.  I realize it was the end of the night but does that rationalize a complete lack of communication? Food - It looks tantalizing but it tastes like nothing.  The Bulgagi Dog was a basic hotdogs loaded with the most bland bulgagi beef I have ever tasted.  It had onions and sautayed cabbage with some sort of sauce on the top.  Sadly the most notable thing about it was that it was so over stuffed that flavorless beef fell off with every bite.  That was great since the tinny tray they brought the hotdog over in barely even fit the hotdog.  It was a bland mess. We also got the Korean Chicken sandwich which also looked incredible but if it weren't for the hot sauce and the bun mi slaw it would have tasted like air!  The chicken piece was large and well fried but there wasn't any seasoning in the breading or sauces. Lastly we had a side of large fries - the only thing the cashier managed to say to use was to upsell us on large French fries.  They were well fried and looked seasoned but again, didn't take like anything! They didn't even have a good potatoe flavor.  They did come our piping hot though. Decor - A mash up of magazine articles that mention the store and outdated specials.  Maybe erase the 4th of July special y'all, it's August.... Lastly, I went to the bathroom before we ate and there was the most foul, putrid, rotten food stank in there that I held my breath while washing my hands, debating how much cleaner they were when I walked out. All in all, it was $30 WASTED.  Part of that was a cash tip that I genuinely considered taking back before we left because the whole experience ruined my night.  I walked out hungery and bitter. So do yourself a favor and let your eyes feast on their instagram pics but do right by your task buds and go to Windy City Dogs instead.  This place is all show!",

I decided to get their \"Go big or go home\" dog. Which had beef chili, caramelized onions, bacon, cheese, and I added an egg on for $2 more. And I also got their carne Asada fries. The hot dog itself I give it a 5.5/10. I love chili and hot dog in general so it was good. But not great. No flavor going on with the hot dog, just tastes like a plain old dog, and the chili tasted plain, no flavor. And the egg barely did anything to it. The carne asada fries I give 3/10. The bulgogi was not flavorful. There was a lot of meat, but everything flavor wise did not go well together. So I think. The staff was cool. But I did really like their vanilla creme soda. Overall I was disappointed., just food wise. I don't see myself coming back to be honest",

Usually, if we do go those bbq style restaurants we get carried away and spend tons of money, so I found that this place offers all kinds of hot dog combos and bibimbap! We had both of our kids with us ages 2 and 4 so definitely things for them to eat as well! The Korean influences on these dogs are SO appetizing. I love all kinds of sauce and toppings on hot dogs, and this place definitely satisfied cravings I didn't even know I had! Also, the bibimbap was legit... can't believe I satisfied my craving for that at a hot dog joint haha!",

What's really cool about this eatery is they are vegetarian friendly, you can order any gourmet hot dog on the menu and substitute with soy dog. They offer amazing house specials like Seoul chicken wings, mac n'cheese bacon quesadilla, bulgogi burrito, bibim rice bowl, Korean chicken noodle soup, and a few selection of gourmet fries that are fantastic.  I had the Unsweetened Tea, Angry Gourmet Hot Dog ($7.95), Euro Special Fries ($8.95), and Corn Dog ($2.95). For the hot dog, I substitute the spicy bulgogi pork for a vegetarian soy dog. It is prepared as bite size pieces in a nontoast bun. The meat is cooked thoroughly, it has good flavor, and it is topped with a crunchy Asian slaw, diced jalapeno, and a fiery aioli that taste more like a mild kind of spicy goodness. The topping definitely adds mouthwatering flavor to the hot dog. I love how everything came in unison, it's a harmonious encore of good food, and it taste amazing!   As for the Corn Dog, they use chicken instead of pork or beef. The corn dog batter is just enough coating for the meat to cook. It is serve hot golden brown, outside texture is crispy, and it can be addictive to snack on. Another great item are the Euro Special Gourmet Fries, which is certainly a must have for any first visit. It is serve as very crispy fries with cheese, garlic aioli, and I substitute bacon for a fried egg that is cooked sunny side up. When you mix a piece of that fried egg with melted cheese and tasty garlic fries, it makes every single bite super yummy and totally worth having more.   The service is very good and they are friendly. I had many questions about the menu items and they are patient to answer, just let them know about your preference. They have a huge menu board! You can substitute or add toppings, and they are more than happy to accommodate. Service is fast and food is delivered hot to your table within 10 minutes. You can refill your drink at the soda fountain and the atmosphere is pretty laid back. As for food truck, they are holding off on that due to winter season. You can always check updates on their social media when food truck becomes available. They also do catering for private events and if ever you need them for birthday parties, weddings, reunions, or any social gatherings, contact them for details. By the way, they are closed on Sunday.",

Meal: hangover soup & puppy dog   Spice level: (out of )   Hangover soup:    Puppy dog: 0  Overall:   The soup was delicious, the puppy dog was great. The hangover soup is basically a big bowl filled with glass noodles with a rich chicken broth filled with shredded chicken, spinach, green onion and various spices that will send your tongue on a comfort food party. Not too spicy, not too basic. Loved it! Recommended for all my ramen lovers!   The puppy dog was amazing as well it's just a mini dog as expected. Half of a dog on a bun grilled to perfection naked with the option of adding whatever condiments you want on there. Here's a great suggestion for anyone who never had a dog from here before and skeptical on spending $8 for one. This will be enough to change your mind and make you crave more!   The dining experience:   Casual spot with tables, and table bar. Expect the area to be small with a lot of pop culture articles showing off the accomplishments of this amazing establishment. Great spot to have lunch or to bring a friend who's in a mood for a good hotdog that's similar to the ones street vendors make in the Midwest/east coast.   The final say:   This place gets two thumbs up from me!  Be sure to follow me on Instagram @: culinaryflaire for more content!",

Don't miss out on their seoul to soul wings- large battered chicken wings! Salty so I prefer them without the sauce options. Not only do they offer hotdogs, fries, kimchi quesadillas, but also NOODLES! Korean chicken \"hangover soup.\" There's something for everyone here, even vegetarians. Even my dog got a hotdog the last time we stopped by :-)",

It wasn't bad, just not for me and after today's visit I realized that I was a bit harsh for allowing that to hold a star from them.   This visit I opted to try the original and soy caramel wings. The soy caramel wings are lightly breaded and fried and pack an insanely good taste. I'm personally not a glazed wing fan, so these crispy, crunchy, juicy wings are perfect for me. These alone would have won me over as a die hard fan.   This place is a definite must for every Vegas trip!",

But instead of coffee and croissants it's hot dogs, gourmet fries, wings, and other delicious takes on fried food, just with a Korean twist. Bacon Mac & Cheese Quesadilla?? What. I had a massive chicken sandwich (The Korean Spicy BFC) and I asked for kimchi on it as well. This thing was packed full of flavor and huge! And I originally thought the kimchi came on the side, but they put it ON the sandwich. IT WAS BOMB. The lady working the front told me their kimchi is made in-house and takes two full weeks to prepare. If you want flavor and good service and delicious fried comfort foods, come here. You'll be so happy.",

From first glance entering the restaurant, it is small but has a lot of color and you can tell a lot of life. The restaurant was clean and very orderly as well as the staff was extremely friendly and assisted with the menu as we were first time eaters here.   I of course, was ABSOLUTELY starving and couldn't make a decision so the cashier, Jasmine, who was extremely friendly and knowledgeable as we were trying to decide between so many options on the menu. I asked if she could surprise me as I'm not a picky eater but the only  modification i needed was the dog itself, meaning I don't eat beef hot dogs, and they had the option of turkey which made me soooo happy.   I believe I received the Angry Kimchi, which was the BOMB! The spicy pork was not at all try and had full flavor, and the pickled kimchi in there gave the hot dog the texture with the crunch and citrus flavor. We also ordered the garlic bacon fries(Euro fries) again so good, chunks of bacon crispy fries and a garlic aioli. What more could you want???  We decided this place is our new stop when we see the Las Vegas Aviators play as it is only 5 minutes away. This is a must try place, and once my braces are off, I'm coming back for the Korean style chicken wings, and Soy Caramel ones!!! I'M WATCHING THEM! LOL!",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in on a Friday night while looking for a spot close to Summerlin. The interior is clean and simple and the owner is very very friendly, but man, is this some heavy, heavy food. We ordered the East Coast dog which has pastrami and sauerkraut, the angry burger which had spicy bugolgi, and Euro fries. My favorite was definitely the angry burger. It has the least amount of mayo on it and it was JUICY!! That has to be some fatty 80/20 or something.   The spicy bugolgi was a bomb combo, but because of all the juices, it got soggy pretty fast, so eat up! The East Coast dog was my husband's choice. I really wanted to try the bahn mi but my husband hates bahn mis. The hot dog itself is quality for sure and huge!! I shovel food in my face like there's no tomorrow, but I don't think I could eat more than 2 of those bad boys, when I can do about 4 standard hot dogs. The East Coast dog was good, but nothing special. I'm sure the Asian fusion dogs would have had more interesting flavors. Lastly, the Euro fries. I'd have to agree with the other reviewers on the lack of toppings on these. There is obviously a lot of garlic mayo, but that pork belly was a little skimpy, and we just had to eat about 2/5 of our fries with no toppings because we ran out. The fries are good on their own, but you know when you order specialty fries, you want every bite to be covered with something. Overall, I'd come back to try the bahn mi dog and see if I can bump up the stars.",

The sauce had a nice flavor to it, but wouldn't necessarily consider them to be \"Korean\". Maybe if they used more gochujang (red pepper paste), it would definitely taste more Korean.  Liked the fries and hot dogs better when I had them at the Buldogis in the MVP lounge. I think their concept of food is interesting, the service is friendly and quick, and the food here is pretty good. Can't wait to try some more!",

It took 40 minutes to get 2 hot dogs.  The wait when they are busy is ridiculous.  The food is fine but I cannot bring myself to come back.  My biggest issue is that when I wrote my first review, I was offered free hot dogs for me, my wife, and son to give it another try and that never happened.  Slow and doesn't keep to their word.  Avoid!!!",

The hot dog itself was very favorable and juicy (deep fried? I didn't ask or look), the bun was fluffy and moist, and the meat toppings very favorable. All of the ingredients complimented each other nicely. If I ever get a craving for hot dogs, this will be my go to, but I doubt I'll come here often.",

It's almost a 30 minute drive for me (which is far for Vegas), and the hot dog isn't exactly a meal I plan out way in advance.  That being said, the hot dogs are awesome. Great selection of specialty dogs with American, Korean, and Mexican toppings or you can always go plain Jane. The dog itself is really high quality - all beef with plenty of snap, and if that doesn't appeal to you, they have a spicy one, a veggie one, and I think one that's more like sausage. We tried the bulgogi and east coast (pastrami and sauerkraut) dogs, and both were great. About $6 each and very filling. The munchkin likes her corn dog, but it wasn't anything special. We went for plain fries instead if one with all the toppings, which was good because the dogs were way filling.  The ambiance is a little lacking as almost nothing was changed from the old Quiznos.  They even use the same Q open sign! Overall I loved it, but it's a little far to be a random lunch spot for us.",

I think they had a food truck first or something and turned themselves into a restaurant. I know I know, Food Network has glamorized food trucks with their shows. But, at my former work place, we called them roach coaches for a reason. So, grumbling I went. I figured it can't be all that bad if it says gourmet dogs right? They must pizazz it quite a bit. Sorry, I don't go eating hot dogs for dinner. Gone are my hot dog and ramen days. It's across from Chicago Brewing where I go for a beer now and then. I roll my eyes every time I see the sign. So my best friend is Korean and I've eaten home cooking and gone to tons of Korean restaurants. I am pretty sure if they were to make a hot dog it would probably taste better. Want a burnt hot dog with kimchi on top? By all means you found the joint. The hot dogs aren't event big. Nathan's hot dogs in one of the downtown casinos is better in downtown and about 1/4 the price. I usually get the polish sausage at Costco and hot dog at Sam's Club. Those two fulfill my hot dog craves. And they are a heck of a lot bigger and taste asps without being burnt or some kimchi thrown on top. Man, and they call it gourmet hot dogs. I have a plastic jar of kimchi from Greenland. I think the concept would be about similar if I slap it on a hamburger and call it a gourmet dinner every week when I am cooking. Honestly, if you pan fry kimchi it will come out about the same as this restaurant. Needless to say, I was not blown away from their concept or what they put into their Buldogis.",

The jumbo corn dog was a complete joke. It was nothing more than a deep fried foster farm corn dog. Nothing jumbo about it and definitely doesn't fit in with their gourmet dogs that they're known for. Save your $1.75 and don't buy this.   The good. The hot dogs even without all the unique topping is very flavorful and definitely 10 times better than any ordinary hot dog. The angry dog had bulgogi meat, asian slaw, spicy mayo and jalapenos. It did not disappoint, I would have liked it spicier however it had a very good balance.   Banh mi dog was a pleasant surprise. The crisp pieces of pork and the pickled veggies made the whole experience amazing.   I will for sure come back here again.",

I LOVE the whole culinary fusion trend that's been going on the past few years  but Buldogis didn't WOW me like some other fusion places (komex, bacci burger, even the LA food trucks - kogi truck!).  The hotdogs were ok (ordered the buldogi and the angry dog). of the two, the angry was a bit tastier and had more flavor. A bit messy to eat as there's so much topping, you had a lot of spillage.  Although the specialties are the hotdog, the Loved the fries so much more. The Angry Kimchi Fries were amazing! Sweet potato fries with kimchi, cheese, jalapenos, and an egg on top! mix is all up for an amazing \"side\". I think next time i'll just order this as the portion is huge! Euro fries were ok. Not that great either, the pork belly \"bacon\" could have been crisper but the cheddar and garlic mayo were a good touch.  I would eat here again but it would not be my first choice.   It's not bad by any-means, it just didn't punch me in the face with deliciousness. I say, try it once just to say you tried it and decide for yourself!",

    "text": "We had heard of Buldogis from fellow yelper Anthony S, but had never made it out there because it was so far from where we live. One random day, Kalila and I found ourselves on that side of town and took advantage of it by finally trying this place out.  My favorite food is hot dogs, so I definitely had high standards and high expectations.  I ordered the beef buldogi dog and kaliia had the banh mi dog. We also got the chicken wings with a side of asian ginger sauce.  The beef bulgogi dog was very delicious and flavorful. The meat was tender. The bulgogi mayo was a great compliment to the hot dog.  Kalila's banh mi dog was really good as well. The sriracha mayo was perfect for her. Not too spicy and not too mayo-y. The pork belly and banh mi slaw worked well with the hot dog.  The hot dogs themselves are thick and juicy. Each hot dog is really loaded up with its' toppings so you get your money's worth... if not more.  The chicken wings were not anything special. I was looking forward to the asian ginger sauce being something similar to the asian zing sauce at buffalo wild wings, but it wasn't even close. The asian ginger sauce was more like an oil and you could barely even taste it.  Somewhat of a disappointment since their hot dogs were so good that the same amazement couldn't transfer over to the chicken wings, but it's ok. You're not really ever going to go to bulDOGis for chicken wings. You will go and get hooked on their amazing hot dogs.  I just couldn't resist another hot dog. I then ordered the buckeye dog. The corn relish was the business. The bacon was crispy. It was awesome all around.  They have a large menu and plenty more foods to try. Aside from the menu behind the counter, they have an additional menu of specials written on a chalkboard wall to the left.  There are clean restrooms inside (separate men & women, individual use).  They have 2 tv's and if you ask for the remote, they will allow you to change the channel. We watched the rebels lose to SDSU. Our stomachs were happy, but we left heartbroken.  MUST TRY THIS PLACE.",

I was skeptical at first because the thought of mixing \"asian slaw\" (usually nasty) into a hot dog didn't sound too appealing but lo and behold...it turned out to be amazing.  I think the key part here is their bun.  A dry and incompetent bun usually ruins hot dogs for me.  Buldogi's buns were nice, soft and big enough to fit all the goodies.  I'm coming back for sure to try the ANGRY KIMCHI FRIES!!",

The fries were also good and surprisingly crisp even though they too had pork belly bacon and mayo on top.  The bun was soft but not soggy or stale.

There were different sauces to use for dipping for you fries and so many delicious add on..... they were great. There are so many options for hot dogs and other food besides that. There was also a check in offer for 10% off your meal which was great! Highly recommend this joint if you want a plain dog or a fancy one! Food was quick, hot, and fresh! And the beef was out of this world as far as quality goes. Definitely my top spot for a hot dog and fries.",

The Angry Kimchi Fries are one of the most imaginative side dishes offered in the Las Vegas Valley and they are a perfect compliment to just about any meal.   Some of you may remember when McDonald's fries were like Crack (before they changed the something or other). Back in my college days, my girlfriend used to make me drive to McDonald's to get their fries, but then to some other place for the burgers.   Buldogis' Angry Kimchi Fries are one of those 'have to have them with just about every meal' sides that will have you coming back - even if it's just to pick up the best side dish in town to go with your meal from some other place.",

If you are in the mood for a hotdog, give it a try. Also, we told them we found out about it on yelp and gave us a 10% discount (unfortunately, he already rang us up, but gave us a free drink) so make sure you let them know how you found out about them!",

Fish tank of behaved fishes 3. Peter rabbit  4. See-thru clock 5. Electric floral cords 6. Cool doggy station up front  On to business, I had the beef bulgogi dog and Angry  fries  The hot dog alone was GOOOOD itself. The beef tasted pure. No mysterious flavors or textures. The toppings(bulgogi, asian slaw, g-onions, sesame seeds, and bulgogi mayo)were slightly sloppy but fresh and tasty. Yes, fresh. I think the sesame seeds give the taste a nice touch.  Make sure you have a stack of napkins before you begin. You will need them.  Note to petite ladies: one dog is filling enough, just incase you're craving two or one dog plus fries, think twice or you'll be bringing it home. And let's face it, soggy fries or soggy buldogis as leftovers isn't the tastiest.  The Angry fries were made with sweet potato, spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, five cheeses, egg, green onion, jalapeno. Filling. The end. It's good, I usually like a side of hot sauce to go with most of my meals, but this is spiced just enough from the kimchi.   They also have a huge white wall of their specials. Beer battered jalapeno pickle spears, pork belly kimchi dog, rice bowls, home-made kimchi to go. They also have energy drinks here as an option, of course to bring down all that grease.",

Inappropriate I'm sure, but I just have to agree with Paola C...\"the sausage is so good... Thick and crunchy! \" lol.  They serve korean inspired hot dogs. Which is just amazing as it sounds. So many unique hot dogs to choose from and toppings/sauces to add. The hot dog was so frickin delicious.    The staff is friendly and very helpful in giving you suggestions on what to order and answer any questions you may have. The shop is cute and showcases all of their press features along the back walls. There are cute dog decorations all over the restaurant...pun on the hot dog concept.    Do yourself a favor and stop in for some extremely delicious and memorable eats.",

This is the first pieces of advice I have for you, Yelp - these little dogs are mighty filling and the fries are HUGE.  We ordered the smoked dog, the hawaiian dog, the philly cheese steak dog (on special that month), and the euro fries. By the time we'd devoured the 3 dogs, there was no way we could even make a dent in the fries ! Each dog was loaded with meat and cheese and yummy sauces. So delicious! The dogs themselves were of very high quality and the buns were tasty as well. My only disappointment was that the philly cheese steak dog isn't around 24/7, because that was the best one we tried!   Cute, clean place. Creative dogs. Friendly staff. Fair prices. Worth a try if you love hot dogs as much as I do!",

(And that is good) I just moved from Rancho Bernardo CA and the hot new place  there for hot dogs had a chili dog that was vegetarian no meat available.  The family that owns it claims everything is authentic. The East Coast Dog is great.  I lived in Jersey for a while.  I can't identify what in it  is East Coast but loved it.   Yes we all know many people swear by Costco hot dogs.  I don't even discuss Costco hot dogs with Costco fans. Dollar per dollar this is the best.  And the service is amazing.  Both times I have been there I can't say enough about the service.  AND they love dogs!  My German German Shepherd was spoiled this time. We are going back!",

I usually get the teriyaki dog myself, but my roommate gas tried several others, not a miss yet! The euro fries are a tasty tasty treat. But like most treats should be consumed on moderation....who am I kidding, they're so good!  Also a special shout out to those with gluten sensitivities: Buldogis won't hesitate to skip the bun and put your delicious hot dog and toppings over a bed of spinach or lettuce! I personally think the spinach is a little tastier but the owner tells me he's moving toward the lettuce -based 'dog salad', which should be a huge hit this summer! Be sure to ask for your Buldogis without the bun!",

    "text": "If you love hot dogs, then you'll love this place! They've got turkey dogs, veggies dogs, and my favorite... all beef dogs! However, they're no ordinary dogs (though you can buy one that way). I chose the East Coast Dog that was topped with pastrami, sauerkraut, tomatoes, and their Buldogi mayo. My boyfriend chose two: one topped with teriyaki beef, roasted peppers, sesame seeds, and teriyaki sauce which, quite fittingly, was called their Teriyaki Dog. He, also, tried one of their specials of the day... the Philly Steak Dog (which wasn't on the menu). It had steak, peppers, shredded cheese, and Buldogi mayo. Then, to top off our order, we had some Euro Fries that were covered with pork belly bacon, herbs, cheese, and garlic mayo.  I enjoyed my dog (I love me some pastrami and sauerkraut), but I wish they had used a more tangy sauerkraut rather than sweet. My bf's Teriyaki dog was amazing! He said that he'll, definitely, be getting that again (and I may get one for myself, too... yeah, it was that yummy)! The Philly was alright, but nothing that either of us would order in the future. He tried it out because one of the staff had suggested it and said that it was pretty good. The fries were pretty tasty. They were a little on the salty side, not because of the toppings, but I think because of the seasoning salt that was on the fries themselves. Next time, I think I'll ask for them lightly seasoned... just in case.  There are so many hot dogs to choose from (and you can create your own, as well) that the bf and I have decided that we'll be back.  He wants to try out their Banh Mi Dog and I'd like to try the Buckeye.  Overall, the experience was great! It helps that the owner and his staff were super friendly. From the minute we walked through the door to the time we got up to leave, we received excellent customer service.",

The first time I went I was super impressed. I'm not always a fan of hot dogs, but WOW this place was good! I got the West Coast dog, with caramelized onions pico de gallo and a little guac on top. Amazing. The 2nd time I went they not only remembered me (from like a month ago) but also remembered my order and suggested next time I should try it with bacon. My only thought at this point is \"where have you been all my life?!\" Definitely check this place out if in the area, or if not, it's well worth the trip! Amazing food and crazy friendly staff. I will definitely be back, often :-)",

However, I have had the pleasure of eating Gourmet Hot Dogs here in Vegas and around Los Angeles -- and Buldogis doesn't disappoint.  Korean Fusion is only good if the chef knows what he's doing -- and the chef definitely knows what he's doing. I ordered two bulgogi dogs and one euro fries and had one of the best meals at work, ever. AND it doesn't break the bank.  But even with good food, I was more surprised with how friendly everyone was. The Cashier, the Chef, and the Owner were all very inviting and made me feel comfortable ordering for the first time.  So, what does that leave us with? Good Food and Good Service, at a Good Price; how can it get any better?!  P.S. If you're looking for the place, it's hiding a bit north of the Jack in The Box next to Regal's Movie Theater on Sahara and Fort Apache.  If you're a True Vegas kid, it's near that big beer brewing place that you've always wanted to go into, but never did.",

The Banh Mi Dog was great with the sirracha mayo and slaw but the Angry Dog; what did I do to you?  The sausage is spicy and delicious but add the hot sauce and jalapenos and my mouth was on fire.  Add more heat with the angry kimchi fries; OMG! (OK so I did add a side of jalapenos so this is kinda my fault).  The fries (what I could taste) were overly sweet if eaten on their own.  Break the egg yolk and make a gooey mess out of the whole thing,  the heat abates and you have good eats.   Note:  Unlike most of my reviews, this review is based on a single visit.  Worth a try.",

Perfect timing - hit the gym for about 2 hours, probably burned at least one hot dog so i went ahead and ordered 3...and some Angry Kimchi Fries.... but i only ate 1/2 of each dog !   I like the concept of this place - a lot of topping options - didn't really pay attention to the topping prices so not sure if reasonable.  I opted for the specialty dogs .  The kimchi fries - didn't do much for me - the sweetness of the sweet potato fries dominated the overall taste - i was expecting some savory, some heat but i wasn't feeling it.  The dogs ( all under $5 ) - The buckeye, chili cheese and the banh mi.  I liked the toppings on all three but i'm not sold on the hot dog itself.  Not sure if it's due to my taste buds being dulled by years of eating der weinerschnitzel dogs, am/pm dogs or the ultimate, slots of fun mega dogs or was it due to eating there just before they closed or maybe the hot dog ain't that good.    Given the creativity of the toppings and the good service, i think it's worth another try but if the dog still doesn't float my boat, sadly, there's no future for me and  Buldogi's.  pics attached",

To say that they put a twist to the hot dog would be an understatement. Each hot dog is a specially crafted mixture of flavors and textures that definitely takes the classic to a whole new level but doesn't drown out the hot dog so much that you forget you're having a fun-time staple of food.   It's the same with their fries, each choice has to be tried at least once. Unfortunately, I haven't even began to try their burger yet but I am sure they'll be just as amazing,  One tip: the dogs they craft are so different in flavor....go with a group....order a few and split them up. This will give you a chance to see just how eclectic their style really is.",

    "text": "I was sitting at me desk one day and I got a text from my wife.  This is how it read.    \"Someone told me of a place that has kimchi fries!\"    I was immediately intrigued.  Those two food items together?  I thought to myself, I must try these magical fries.  The next few weeks we were trying to get to Buldogis.  I did my Yelp research and checked out the pictures.  I love it when two food style are mixed.  We finally make the trek here.  I'm about to explain to you why I gave this place 5 stars.  First take a seat  and listen to my crazy adventure my family had when we went to Buldogis.    Let me give you a little back story.  I have two girls.  A 1 year old and a 3 year old.  On this particular day my 3 year old was a little grumpy.  We made it to the restaurant and ordered a couple hot dogs, kimchi fries, a mini hot dog, and a corn dog.  Right after we ordered, my 3 year old just loses it.  I think she got mad because her sister stole something she was holding.  My wife takes her to the car because she is a mess.  (if you have small children you know what I am talking about.)  I am sitting there with my 1 year old and all the food comes.  It looks delicious.  After a little while I start to eat and then text my wife to come inside and I will try to calm down my 3 year old.  She agrees and comes to enjoy her hot dog.  I get to the car and my 3 year old finally calms down.  As we are walking toward the restaurant my wife comes out upset and tells me to get the baby.  As I go into the restaurant my wife was getting a drink refill and our 1 year old throws my wife's uneaten hot dog to the floor.  So my wife lost it and was upset.  (like I said if you have small children you know the setting.)   This brings me to why I gave them 5 stars.  The food was awesome and different.  The girl at the counter was super nice.  She cleaned up the food on the floor right away and and they started making my wife a new hot dog.  At this point I am really embarrassed.  They were awesome, I apologized and said not to worry.  This is some top notch service.  Great food and great people.  You have to try this place out.  Don't worry at the end my wife ended up eating her hot do and some kimchi fries.  Cheers!",

Next time we will just opt to make our own hot dogs there.   The service is fast and they are very friendly. Make sure you check in to get the 10 percent off special",

Both extremely delicious and fulfilling.  I wish the Fries was a bit more meaty considering there was bacon AND pork belly.  Every bite should have either one of the meats!  But still really good!  My hot dog, sounds like it could be overwhelming w/ the added Philly Cheesesteak atop my hot dog, but it was just the right amount.  My favorite part on both these dishes?  The GARLIC MAYO!  I'll never forget it!  My boyfriend had the Banh Mi Dog and loved every bite of it as well.  We are coming back to try more of the menu!  Can't wait!",

I had the Angry Dog which was so much better than I had expected - I totally loved it, especially with the fried egg on top.  Every bit as advertised - yummy indeed!  I have to go back and try some more of the varieties - wasn't too hungry the night I visited.  ~ 5 stars - great concept, super friendly staff, unrushed atmosphere, cheap food and DELICIOUS food!  I will be back for sure :)  # 290",

Today was finally the day, and it was better then I expected.  The little shop is bright and colourful and the walls are lined with the various awards and recognition they've received.  In addition to the menu that they have online, there's a giant whiteboard with even more amazing choices.  I had the bahn mi dog and the angry kimchi fries, which I split with my dining buddy. Both amazing dishes, I especially liked the hot dog though. Juicy, 100% all beef, bacon sauce and the bahn mi pickled carrots / radish and soft warm bun made it the best hot dog I've ever had.  I'll be back to try more dogs and the hamburgers look good too!  I think they would do really well with a vendor truck too. It would be awesome to see them downtown, they'd give fuku burger a little friendly competition",

    "text": "Hot dogs are not a typical meal I would venture across town to enjoy, however Buldogis might be worthy of that journey.  Located in the Village Square shopping center at Sahara and Ft. Apache on the west side of Las Vegas.  I was extremely hungry that afternoon and was just going to settle for some \"Jack\" when I saw the sign and decided to give Buldogis a try.    The menu is very complex with dozens of unique specialty dogs or burger offerings with fries and beverages of course.  Flavors are inspired from different cultures such as Korean, Filipino, American, and even Mexican.  Some of the specials being offered this week were the Dragon Kimchi dog, Philly Steak dog, and Carne Asada dog.  I opted for the Carne Asada this trip.  After ordering, and a short wait I had my dog ready for chowing down. At first glance my initial response was Whoa! how am I going to eat that.    I had to plan my strategy on how to best attack this dog of epic proportions.  Of all possible methods knife and fork seemed the most realistic and sensible approach to not ruin my tie.  The dog itself is a 1/4 pounder served on a sesame seeded bun that was baked fresh that day for sure.  What made this dog slightly overwhelming was the way it was topped with thin strips of beef, cheese, pico de gallo, sliced jalapeno's, and smothered with chipotle mayo.  All the flavors together blended well creating a memorable and authentic flavor profile.  I could tell they really put some thought into these recipes and combinations.  I enjoyed this Hot dog very much. The all beef dog itself had great flavor and would have been great on its own with only mustard and ketchup.    The service at Buldogis was ok but could be improved upon.  In these small mom and pop ops they do not exactly have the best staff training materials.  They were friendly and helpful enough to assist in understanding the daunting menu.  Rumor has it they have a Mac n Cheese Dog that was not on the special board at the time.  I might have make the journey to Summerlin to try and take on this urban legend of a dog.  Enjoy your visit.",

With a few of the fella's, I hopped into the car and off we went.  Upon arrival, I was sad to discover BC was no longer at the location given by yelp.  We ended up dining somewhere else for lunch.  With the craving and awesome reviews still haunting me.  I researched the web and found BC's present location on Sahara and Fort Apache.  The next day now armed with update to date information, the crew assembled for yet another lunch adventure.  Walking into Buldogis, I found the find the vibe to be cool and friendly.   There is a large board with all there is to dine on hand written on a wall. The nice gentleman behind the counter kindly greeted us and let us know there were menus at the table to review.  Man!  I wanted to order everything off the menu!!  The fear of stroking out prevented me from doing so.  What I did order was a Beef Bulgogi Dog w/ bulgogi and fried onions.  Because this one looked so damn good...I ordered up a dog, The Hawaiian.  This masterpiece had pork belly and some kind of pineapple salsa on top.  The group shared some Euro Fries.  These contained pork belly, cheese and a delicious garlic mayo.  The food was fantastic! MESSY and wonderful!  With that said, beware.....it can take a little while in it's preparation.  If you come during lunch be sure to bring a side of patience.",

The bulgogi was just too salty to be complimented with even more meat, especially cheap meat like a hotdog.   Youre taking expensive meat and mixing with a low end meat.  The meat flavors didnt' mix.   After a few bites, I really couldn't tell the difference between the sauce, the onions, the coleslaw, the bulgogi and the hotdog.  Honestly, I wanted to like the concept alot.  But somehow low end hot dogs just doesn't deserve to be called gourmet, no matter what you pile on it.   Thats like taking a cow, slap on a tutu and calling it a ballerina!  Meh.  Great Service though and friendly establishment.",

Bulgogi dog had the right amount of seasoning and was absolutely delicious! Banh Mi dog had a nice crunch from the slaw which fit well with the saltiness of the wiener. Finally the euro special fries were as good as expected with enough sauce and cheese to satisfy every bite! The fries were also crispy instead of becoming soggy. I'll be looking forward to trying out the other hot dog selections in the near future!",

We asked a lot of questions and he was patient, explaining each of the items we asked about. We decided to get the Bahn Mi dog, the Angry dog and the Euro fries.   The dogs were terrific. The hot dogs are 1/4 pound dogs that snap when you bite them. The rolls are soft and generous enough to hold the toppings that are piled high. The bahn mi is topped with pickled vegetables that are tangy and fresh as well as what seemed like a slab of bacon and some delicious sriracha mayo. The Angry dog has its own slab of bacon, a crunchy slaw blend and jalapenos. The Euro fries were delicious drenched in garlic aioli, covered with cheese and more bacon. The portions are huge. Check it out. You won't be sorry!  * The fella who waited on us gave me a sample of their kimchi when I asked about it. It was delicious too. We'll be back... soon.",

Whether it's for brunch or dinner...yum, yum, and yum!   I ordered the Hawaiian dog, which consisted of pork belly, pineapples, caramelized onions and jalapenos with a huge buldogi hot dog! It was so good, definitely stuck to the \"Hawaiian\" in its name. My boyfriend ordered the angry dog. Beware: this dog is spiiiiiicy! It has some green onions, jalapenos and the best of it all, the angry dogs sauce! It's literally drizzled in it, and it tastes so delish! Then we shared a carne asada fries, Which is not your regular carne asada fries. It really isn't!! It has thick cut fries, salsa, some huge chunks of meat and this light green sauce that is just EVERYTHING!   If you check in on Yelp, they give you 10% off your order. Heeeey! I love me some extra discount! I really wish we had a bulgogi on my side of town, but it's definitely worth the drive!",

The fries were darn good and the dogs were great too. We both really liked the carne asada dog , dragon dog and the angry dog. But toward the end it all started tasting the same perhaps it was just too much. But another reason might be even thought the topics on the dogs were different, the dogs were mostly the same so that might be why they kinda did taste the same.  Don't get me wrong all the dogs were pretty good, just don't try too many at ones lol.",

    "text": "Okay, I have a pretty hearty appetite and so does the s/o.  So when everyone says to just order one hot dog, just order ONE!  I ordered the Angry Dog, which was a hot dog, topped with spicy pork, slaw, chopped jalapenos and spicy mayo.  I'm not a fan of eating two types of meat at the same time, (i.e. Pastrami Hamburger) but damn, this was one good hot dog!  First off, the hot dog they used had to be one of the most flavorful, robust tasting dog I've ever had, hands down beating every hot dog/polish dog I've had at Costco and AT&T Park.  That was definitely some premium stuff, which is a major plus!  But paired with the spicy pork and the other stuff, it was so delicious!!!  The s/o ordered the Banh Mi Dog and had the same sentiments about the quality of hot dog.  The s/o really liked the Banh Mi Dog, especially the slaw that it was served with.  The s/o also ordered their Angry Kim Chi fries and I ordered their Classic Buldogis Fries.  The Classic Buldogis Fries had a light seasoning but, I'd definitely suggest going for the Angry Kim Chi fries.  We didn't know what to expect as to how it would taste so when it came out, it was one steamy pile of Korean inspired goodness, with fried egg on top.  Just grab a fork, mix it all together and have it.  That was truly one unique order of fries, none like we've ever had before.  Everything paired well together; the egg, the kim chi, the spicy pork, cheese and jalapenos.  You can say it's the Korean version of Carne Asada fries.  I'd totally recommend checking out Buldogis if you're in their neck of the woods, it's definitely worth a visit, as we'll definitely come back when we're back in the LV!",

The pineapple salsa and honey dijon mustard provided great balance to the saltiness of the dog and the pork belly.......Oh man, the pork belly...if only they could crisp it a little more.....I don't care what you say...i 'll take pork belly however I can get it.  It's like bad or good sex.  Who cares - it's all good!  Very tasty dogs - I won't take 6+ inches because I'm not that kind of guy but I'd take 12+ inches of their fusion dogs if they offered it!",

These guys are doing a neat twist on simple ingredients.  They're making a killing on food cost if they're managing things well.    I tried two today - and took half of each home.  (hint:  you need a \"dogi\" bag\"!)    Their chili cheese dog is made with homemade chili - no beans (yay!), grated cheese and green onions.  The angry dog was the flavor winner but my bun was on the stale side...but I loved the flavor combination, the slaw, the spicy mayo and the fresh jalapenos...  They fry their dogs...and the dogs are nice sized... Lots of interesting ingredients and combinations.    Whoever said their food was bland ordered blandly - this place is all about flavor...so ask the chef -- because he's definitely hospitable, large and in charge and very proud of what he's cooking.  Staff is proud to offer up tastes, too.    They take credit cards.  No beer.   Only open til 9. Their menu would be  a great food truck concept...so I hope they jump in and take their place, if only for marketing their restaurant all over town...because this isn't a location that is an easy find by any means... it would perfect on the strip though -- for late night eating after a night of serious partying -- f&b folks take note.  It's exactly the kind of fun food chefs love to eat after a hard night on the line -- with a few beers -- and that's only one demand generator...  This is a great concept in the wrong location - but it's a good way to get their feet wet...hopefully you'll go find them to help them work out the concept kinks so they can be located where they truly need to be.  Good luck!",

I love the menu and the variety in the menu, but was less thrilled with the actual product.    Like most red hot places, the majority of the space inside is dedicated to the grill.  This can make for a very hot room to eat in, so be warned.  The restaurant is neat and clean, with a couple things on the wall and a TV.  The staff was friendly and welcoming, and happy to explain the menu for those who inquire.  The food:  We had the Classic Buldogi, the Smoked dog, and the Bahn Mi dog.  Of the three, the Bahn Mi dog was flavorful and satisfying.  The other two left a lot to be desired.  I would rather have a good hot dog and good bulgogi individually if they are not complementing one another, and these did not complement each other.  Angry Kimchi fries - This was a hot mess.  The flavors worked well together (sweet potato fries btw) but it was just so messy.  The fries became soggy very quickly under the heavy toppings.    Seasoned Fries - The fries had an odd aftertaste about them.  I think maybe it is cumin that I was tasting, but I'm not sure.  Either way, I'm not a fan of fixing something that isn't broken, and these fries would have been better senza the seasoning.    Overall Buldogis is an alright place, but with all the Korean fusion eateries around town, I'm not left yearning for seconds.",

We also ordered Carne Asada Fries, which tasted very American and no Mexican flavor at all, it was more like sauteed beef and cheese atop crispy fries.

Quite honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I entered Buldogis, but what I found while I was there were some pretty phenomenal things - great quality ingredient being well prepared for a great price. When I bit into my first dog, I couldn't believe that I was paying just $5 for really, really gourmet flavors.  Check this place out if you consider yourself the adventurous type.

I had the banh mi dog, hubs had the buckeye dog and baby had the puppy dog with ketchup - and we shared the classic fries. As a lover of all thing hot dog, this place did not disappoint. I'm usually a chili dog or ketchup and onions gal, so having the banh mi dog with pork belly, slaw and sriracha mayo was a bit of a leap for me, but it was soooo good. The hotdogs themselves are delicious, and the unusual concoctions just work. I tried a bit of the buckeye dog too and it was just as good. This is the kind of place where you're already planning your next trip before you leave. In fact, I would probably have lunch there today if I wasn't across town. I can't wait to go back and try something else.",

    "text": "I came here with my boyfriend today after finishing up our pottery over at Color Me Mine. I was trying to find a place close to it and saw the cute play on words on Bulgogi/Bulldogs/Hot dogs (haha). And, asian fusion hotdogs? Hell yes. It just sounds good. Remember to check in on Yelp for a 10% off offer (as of the date of this review!).   First thing we noticed was the fact that they totally stole the Quizno's \"open\" sign! Haha. Inside, there's mouth-watering hi-res pictures of some dishes on the wall and a few printed commended news articles about this place framed up. First thing I did right before we ordered was grab a ton of napkins. It's that messy. =]  We ordered the East Coast Dog (pastrami, sauerkraut, tomato, and buldogi mayo); and Beef Bulgogi Dog (bulgogi, asian slaw, green onions, sesame seeds, and bulgogi mayo); Angry Dog (spicy pork bulgogi, asian slaw, diced jalapenos, and fiery sauce). My boyfriend and I decided to cut eat one down the middle and sample all three! Lovely idea. Really, it was just an excuse because we couldn't settle on just one.  The guy behind the counter didn't just call our names to pick up the dogs, but he actually went up to our table and laid it down. Wasn't expecting that gesture for a hotdog fast food place! Awww it's the little things that get me. Nice service here! I asked a few questions about the sauces, and the guy offered us to sample their mayos. Pretty helpful.  Each dog was LOADED with the toppings. East Coast dog was savory, heavy, and sinfully lip-smacking good. Beef Bulgogi Dog was perfectly drenched in marinated bulgogi-goodness. Flavors worked well with the other toppings. To finish off, Angry Dog was just the right amount of spicy for me. This dog had extra-chewy bulgogi (mmm pork)! Pretty spicy but not overwhelming. Each one lived up to one another. My boyfriend was expecting a let-down or a dog that wouldn't taste as good as the previous, but no matter which dog you get, it holds its own! No disappointment whatsoever. In case you're wondering the difference between the BulGogi mayo and the BulDogi mayo: Bulgogi mayo has some sesame oil in it to specifically go with the asian fusion dogs. Buldogi mayo goes well with the pastrami. This attention to detail and taste is what makes this place awesome. Each one was a symphony of flavor.  Would definitely come here again. Maybe as a hangover cure or an excuse to sample their other stuff. This place is simply not just another hotdog fast food gimmick. The food definitely hit the spot. =] Highly recommended!",

All the dogs are overwhelming to choose from but I was happy with every one I tried. There were so many I don't remember the make up of each and every one but if you take a glance at their menu you'll be hungry in about 10 seconds.  Definitely try this place when in Vegas. It's a bit off the beaten path and you'll need a car to get there. I've been visiting family here since I was young and let's just say it took me years to find this place. So let's hope Yelp saves you that trouble and you can try it ASAP.",

    "text": "Given its limited space, narrow open kitchen, and minimal menu layout, Buldogis is what I'd imagine a restaurant would be like if a working gourmet food truck backed into a shopping center unit and never left.  If that was the desired effect, then I must applaud these guys on a job well done.    Jokes aside though, this place is probably one of my favorite places to eat in the city.  Whenever I'm in the mood for the grandest, most rich, most decadent, greasy, wonderful feast I could possibly conjure up in my deepest desires... Whenever I want to have a meal that not only fills my stomach, but makes me happy to be alive, I come here.    It's got a fast-food vibe, a menu derived from familiar junk food items, but your food will take a good minute to prepare. That's because the ingredients are fresh, the sauces are hand-crafted, and each meal is made to order.    Buldogis puts a unique spin on American classics like hot dogs, hamburgers, and fried chicken.  They offer an impressive list of gourmet dogs, all of which can be made into burgers. My favorites are the angry dog (spicy pork, Asian slaw, jalapenos, spicy mayo) and the Santa Fe dog (hot link, chili, cheese, pico de gallo, chipotle mayo).   Unfortunately for my waist-line,  I can't come here without ordering a side of specialty fries.  My favorites are the carne asada fries (the best I've ever had), and Euro fries (pork belly, cheddar, garlic mayo, herbs). These are must-try items, and I'd say, if you get nothing else, try these!  They also have great chicken strips, and chicken wings.. Well-fried, not greasy at all. Who would have guessed a hot dog place would be so great at frying chicken?  The hangover soup is another must-try. It will clear your sinuses guaranteed!  If you like spicy food I recommend ordering a side of dragon sauce. It's a unique Asian-inspired hot sauce that I can't get enough of.",

I'm located all the way in Seven Hills area and decided to take a trip to Summerlin just to try this place out. This is located on Sahara and Fort Apache. Quite a distance but still worth the journey.  I Ordered the Bulgogi Dog and a drink all for $10- $11 including tip, a bit pricey but hey these are freaking gourmet hot dogs! The Bulgogi dog was amazing!! The bulgogi itself had a good texture not to rubbery or chewing along with the hot dog. The size is pretty decent, you might want to order two hot dogs to fill you up if your a big eater like myself. Overall the hot dog was the bomb and I would like to go back and order more next time. I had to save my stomach to try another establishment next door. But overall, I give this place a 4 star, can't complain.  This place takes hot dogs to the next level, by fusing an ordinary hot dog with other ethnic foods such as korean and american or mexican and american. Try it now these gourmet hot dogs are to die for..",

At first I was hesitant because I'm not a big fan of hot dogs, let alone a weird mix of Korean and hot dogs. On their walls they have a bunch of articles/reviews about them from the Las Vegas papers/magazines, but I didn't want to create a judgement just yet. I wanted to taste it for myself.  They had this bulgogi burger and it definitely satisfied the hungry beast in my stomach. My boyfriend got kimchi fries as well, but there was so much that even the both of us couldn't finish it all after my burger and his bulgogi hot dog. Overall, i'd like to go back and try something new.",

We pulled up and entered Buldogis to only 2 other patrons enjoying their lunch. The order taker was very pleasant offering us samples of their homemade bean-less chili which was DELISH. I kinda knew from photos and other reviews I wanted the Bulgogi Dog, I ordered a hot dog with just ketchup for my daughter, and Hubby created his own. We also ordered some french fries and sat down.   We sat and took in all the decor! As we were waiting there was a steady stream of patrons coming through the door, the place filled up QUICK!!! I told my Hubby right away that's an awesome sign! The order taker brought us our food and it was ON. I loved every bite of my hot dog and the french fries were tasty. My Hubby LOVED the flavor of the hot dog and surprised me by saying so. He's picky people!!!! We ended up ordering some bread pudding to go and left.   Okay so I LOVED our visit to Buldogis and I look VERY MUCH forward to returning. The reason for my 4 star? Well its actually 4.25555, I didn't care for the bread pudding =( I'm  a bread pudding snob lmao It was pretty dense but not moist and I needed like a cup of the caramel sauce which was tasty! Maybe I'll order it to it there and give it another shot next time we go!",

I really like the slaw they put on top of the hot dog.  For those that aren't into hotdogs, Buldogis also offers fusion burgers and fries. Also, they have some more traditional style (non-Asian) hot dogs such as Chicago style which was also really good. Come try this place out. There is something for everyone.",

I won't say it had an authentic style Chicago hot dog, but it was really freakin' awesome all the same.  Plus, my wife and I tried some deep fried pickle spears, and they were really good, as well as their dipping sauces; one was a really flavorful ranch, another was a barbeque with hints of Korean seasoning, and then a spicy mayo/mustard mix.

Some of the best carne asada fries I have ever had . I then tried the kimchi fries, (I'm not a big fan of kimchi) but there fries had me thinking twice. The egg on top was perfect, the meat was flavorful and the kimchi wasn't super over powering . Recently , my classmate bought chicken fingers and they were crisped to perfection. I personally like mine a bit more on the spicy side so when I came in and asked the cashier told me they don't normally sell them like that but that they would make them for me , which was super sweet and thoughtful of them bc not too many places do that for their customers . They rolled my chicken fingers in some hot sauce and dragon sauce , <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> !!!

This place just got added to our must-go-to list (which also includes Aloha Specialties and Bachi Burger)!  Food.  We ordered the Euro Fries which were our favorite. If you don't want a dog, order these and you'll be straight. These were unbelievably great. I ordered two dogs, which I ended up forcing myself to finish because of their big portions. I wanted to try the Banh Mi and the Buckeye, so I figured what the helll why not order both? The Banh Mi was good. I felt like something was missing from it though, cant put my finger on what it was. The Buckeye was pretty much the Euro Fries toppings on a dog. So that was good. My girlfriend got a bulgogi dog; she enjoyed it and was actually complaining about too much meat! (that's what she said). I've never heard anyone complain of too much meat before. The bulgogi tasted like it wasn't marinated long enough to me though.   Overall a great and savory experience. These Asian Fusiom restaurants are too bomb. Can't wait to try the other dogs and the Angry Kimchi Fries.",

I've driven past Buldogis lots of times and decided to check it out yesterday   They advertise a ' Chicago' dog which is my fave.. I'm from Chicago and know a good Chicago dog from an imposter.... The version they serve here is definitely an imposter... Not even a good one When I looked at their menu board I asked if their Chicago dog was served on a poppy seed bun.. No.      Then I asked if they used Vienna Hot Dogs... No.   They mentioned a brand I'd never heard of.   For starters, if you're not serving Vienna brand hot dogs and not using poppy seed buns then you shouldn't call them Chicago Dogs... EVER  So I figured I'd order one of their other specialties... The West Coast Dog sounded good... Cheddar cheese, carmelized onions, and avocado mayo What could be bad?? Apparently everything The place was almost empty, there was no line... But I waited what seemed like forever.... My hot dog arrived in a tiny cardboard serving thingie ... Smothered in condiments and sauce The bun was cold The hot dog was barely warm The bun fell apart when I picked it up Onions tomatoes may cheese everywhere  Including the table because the container was so small.... And no fork to scoop stuff up.... And NO FRIES!!!  The damn hot dog was $6.95  I've never been in any hot dog place anywhere that charged almost seven dollars and had the chutzpah not to include fries Biggest rip-off in town!!! A waste of money",

    "text": "Imagine two college roommates, one an all-american kid raised on classic fast food fare, the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home, and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own.  That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.         Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries  The beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm \"snap\" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.  The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)  If I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.    It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp, but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future.",

It has beef bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, and sesame chicken. Only $8.95. Not too spicy.  I really dig it!  But impossible (at least for me) to finish.  Not to worry - leftovers!  Three meals for $8.95.  Not bad at all.  On another visit I tried the angry kimchi fries which were pretty darn good, too.  Spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, cheese, jalapenos, all topped off with a fried egg.  Yummy!  Another bonus - really nice people running the joint.  We showed up at 8:57pm on a Tuesday when they close at 9pm.  Greeted with a smile, no issues whatsoever.  Fast service, great food!",

    "text": "Meh. I really wanted to like Buldogis but it just didn't live up to the Yelp hype.   I don't expect a hot dog restaurant to be extremely fancy but with the word \"gourmet\" in the name they could work on the decor a little bit. One of the things that really bothered me was the excessive use of demanding signage everywhere within the restaurant. There was one that specified that there is a 2 napkin limit allowed per customer which is ridiculous when you realize how messy these hotdogs really are. Apparently there's a camera watching you above the napkin dispenser - So I took 5, what can I say I'm a little rebel.  I ordered the Angry Dog which was spicy pork, asian slaw, spicy mayo, and jalapenos (fresh raw jalapenos) on top of a hot dog. These things are massive and I would recommend sharing with a friend if you want to order fries as well. I felt like the toppings were just too much at one time. I don't think I appreciate meat on meat on meat but that could be just me. It was salty and overwhelming rather than complementary. I think that their execution could be done with more finesse and it looked as though everything was just thrown on.  I also had the \"Carne Asada\" fries which were pretty average as well. Upon further thought I realized I should've ordered the Angry Kimchi sweet potato fries which seems to be more popular and could have balanced out the saltiness of the hot dogs.   I mean the meats are good but not extraordinary, same goes for the toppings. Combined with the average service (they completely forgot my best friend's order) and average decor I really don't have the urge to return anytime soon. Plus I'm still thirsty from the hot dog I ate 5 hours ago.",

The dogs are very feeling. The bun does fall apart and it gets a bit hard to eat but it's a great twist to a hot dog. We also had the Asada fries. They're the best I've had. Both the chipotle and Avacado aioli are amazing. The environment is very casual and the wait isn't long at all. Great place",

Recently, I had a call in order when I arrived the place was packed and the workers were working fast to satisfy all the orders, which they were.  In my case I was given the wrong to-go-order, which I didn't realize until I got home. I brought the order back the customer service was exceptional. They workers were so apologetic, they replaced my order AND they gave me a comp for a future order for myself and a guest.  I have already redeemed my comp within a week because I love the food. This time I brought my wife, she likes the rice bowls but I enjoy the California dog, Chicago dog, and the Bahn-Mi. I have a good appetite and two of these will fill me up.  If you haven't been you will not be disappointed.   Oh, I forgot to mention the carne asada fries. :)",

Definitely not disappointed! The prices are a bit high but when you see the size of you dog and all the meat they stuff it with, it's well worth it! I ordered the Angry dog since I love spicy. It had jalapenos and lots of pork on it, kinda tasted like adobada taco meat! I did option for puppy size since I get full fast. My honey ordered the Phillies cheese steak and boy was it loaded with steak! He loved it. We will definitely be back! Oh and the cashier was so helpful with suggestions. Awesome customer service.",

I was even able to buy just hot dogs for my picky eater that wants just the hot dog, no bun or anything. I'm happy when a restaurant doesn't give me a hard time about buying just the item plain. Sometimes I have to pay full price for a burger just to get it with nothing so she can have something to eat. Anyways, back to Buldogis. The hot dogs were ah may zing!!!!!!!! Everything about them were worth the drive. My daughter even liked it!!!!! I can't wait to go back to try some of the other menu items. Keep up the good job!!!",

My husband and I came for dinner and decided to eat outside since it was nice out. A little after we started eating an employee looked like they were taking their break to eat at another outdoor table. Within minutes what I'm assuming was the manager came out and started to discipline the worker and we could hear him clearly. Now I'm all for disciplining employees if they have done something wrong but not in front of customers who are trying to eat or outside where there are other patrons from the neighboring businesses outside stop to listen and watch. If something was wrong the employee should have been asked back to a private area. We felt really awkward because the discipliner was not quiet so we left without finishing our food.",

    "text": "Round Two at Buldogis! Here's what I ordered:  Angry Dog:  A juicy, plump dog topped with Asian Slaw, fatty pieces of spicy pork Bulgogi, diced jalapeno peppers, and spicy mayo. This dog gave my tastebuds a bite!   Although I've only dined here twice, I've made the decision that this is my favorite dog, -- at least for now. I prefer The Angry Dog over the Bahn Mi Dog -- which is also worth a try -- because it's much spicier. On the other hand, my cousin ordered the Bahn Mi Dog and thought it was too spicy. Either way, both dogs are  geared towards lovers of spiciness, though you can request to tone it down a few notches.   Euro Fries: I think these tasted better the second time around, or maybe it's because I haven't been here in a while so they just tasted bomb to me? Mmm, pork belly, cheese, and garlic mayo. What an irresistible combination.  Hm, I wonder what's in store for Round 3? Perhaps Angry Kimchi Fries? A Teriyaki Dog? A burger? Don't know, but I think I should start visiting this place more often.",

I'm not always in the mood for a hot dog but after passing this place so many times and reading previous reviews k thought why not? When I walked in there were two guys working one was sitting down in the lobby eating and the other was behind the counter. I started to look at the menu that was posted on the counter next to the register and the guy says \"that's not my menu, the one on the table behind you\" hmm I thought that was kind of strange but whatever he suggested the traditional chili cheese dog or the Chicago style dog I went with the chili dog because the other hot dogs seemed to have way too much going on with them. Hot dog took less than 5 minutes to prepare, got it enjoyed it and I may be back to try the carne asada fries..",

    "text": "This place is 1 mile away from my temporary place of residence and it's dangerous. The first time I went here, I decided on the Bulgogi Hot Dog...and surprise surprise, it was good, flavorful and bulgogiful. I thought it was just an amazing hot dog, the beef was tender and the bulgogi had a good sauce to complement it....no ketchup or mustard needed.  The second time I went here, I got the bulgogi burger. And this burger rivaled the best burger I've had in my life - which was from San Tan Brewery in Gilbert, AZ. It was definitely on par with that other buger. It was just so good from the first bite to the last. There's only so many words to describe this burger so my only recommendation is if you are going to try one item, I truly believe that it should be the Bulgogi Buger. There is another item called the Buldogi burger which is apparently more bland and has no bulgogi, so make sure you don't get confused.  The third time I went here, I was severely disappointed. The chef was teaching a new employee how to make a Bulgogi Burger and I feel that my burger was overcooked. I was not just let down, I was \"oh hey your dad said he was going to take you the baseball game tonight, but then you found out he's taking your new stepmother instead\" let down. It tasted kind of the same, but I could really tell the difference. I dont mind if you're teaching a new person to cook, but just don't make it at my own expense. However poor this third experience was, I find that it would be unfair for me to downgrade the amazingness of the first two visits.   If you're in the area, or near the area, or have a hankering for a bulgogi burger no matter where you might be - this has to be on your list of must stop food places.",

I'm not a huge fan of pork belly unless it's crisp, however, the flavor was good. Loved the touch of pineapple, it just wakes up your taste buds. The hot dog itself was very tasty. Also had the Carne asada fries, so tasty! If you have it along with a dog, be prepared to share! It is enough for 2-3 persons. We will be back. You will not be disappointed. My only negative critique is that the bun was soggy. Hope that will be corrected. I can honestly say, the best hot dog I have ever had.",

We will definitely be back again and we will tell our friends about this amazing place. We are so glad we spotted BUlDOGIS GOURMET HOT DOGS.",

You get this beautiful, tasty creature <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buldogis-gourmet-hot-dogs-las-vegas?select=pOPuQI7bMbMjNHxkvquyvw#yCU0WkMG42PkAcDxqdQV8w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/buld...</a>  Located on the West Side of Vegas, about five or six miles from the busy LV Strip, is Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog's. This tiny place has a fairly large menu with all sorts of crazy hot dog, burger, and French fry concoctions.  My wife and I came here recently and shared three dogs and an order of fries. This is all we split;  Banh Mi Dog- Hot dog, pork belly, slaw, Sriracha mayo & a fried egg Hawaiian Dog- Hot dog, pineapple slaw, grilled onions & honey Dijon mustard Santa Fe Dog- Hot dog, bacon, chili, cheese, pico de gallo , chipotle mayo & avocado mayo Angry Kimchi Fries- Sweet potato fries, spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, five cheese blend, green onions, jalapenos & a fried egg  Every dog we ate was fabulous. My personal fave was the banh mi because it was overflowing with fatty pork belly. The Santa Fe was also a home run because of their homemade chili. The Hawaiian could have been a tad sweeter but it was still delicious. The Angry Kimchi fries were also phenomenal. They topped these fries with tons of juicy bulgogi and spicy kimchi. These were most definitely one of my all time favorite order of fries.   Prices here are cheap. Much cheaper than anything on the Strip. The service was also excellent. The head chef was super cool and chatted with us while we waited for our food.   I'm definitely a fan of Buldogis. I will be back for sure the next time I'm visiting Sin City.",

Their menu is full of unique hot dogs, all with their own combination and flavor. They also sell burgers that are HUGE and again, with unique flavor. But wait, there's more. Their fries are amazingly fresh and packed with meat and cheese.  Buldogis is really too hard to describe in words. Their entire menu is one big experiment, but I can guarantee it all tastes good. The owner is the coolest guy too. He's really friendly and welcoming. This place is definitely worth a try.",

The best part is that they overload the toppings and then top it off with different house made sauces. I've been going with their bulgogi beef bibimbap bowl lately. It's always so filling and delicious. When you're feeling extra hungry, get the euro fries, carne asada fries or the sweet potato kimchi fries. They are so damn good, but the portion is huge so it's definitely shareable. Overall, I'm always satisfied with my food here and I will continue to support this local spot.",

    "text": "Creative concept. I love the idea of an East-Meets-West fusion, combining the most iconic elements of American and Korean culture.  We were in an ANGRY mood apparently when we went, because we got the angry burger, angry kimchi fries, and an angry dog. I loved the spicy kick of each of the items. The burger was juicy, with a hefty amount of toppings. It had an excellent grilled, slightly smokey flavor. The bulgolgi was nice, but I didn't see or taste much of it (Maybe the other stronger ingredients drowned out the bulgolgi flavor). Out of all the toppings for the burger, I was slightly disappointed in the coleslaw. I would have liked more tangy flavor to add to the burger, but it was just a minor flaw. The hot dog was good as well, with a combination of strong flavors complementing each other with each bite. The angry kimchi fries were my favorite item that we ordered. It was a huge portion of sweet potato fries, kimchi, bulgolgi, peppers, cheese, onions, and a fried egg on top. The combintation of sweet, sour, spicy, and creamy was amazing.   This isn't healthy eating here in general, but they do have vegetarian options such as veggie dogs that can be substituted for any hot dog item on the menu.  Service was very friendly. Definitely a good place to get fast-food Asian fusion!",

I would probably go on the first request, but I think he enjoys 'talking me into something new'..  He has been talking up this place for a few months now. I am a pretty straightforward hot dog eater. Always have been. Throw a kosher dog in a bun with a few tomatoes and I'm happy.  Nathans , sure, I a, the easiest person to server. Plain. Why dress up a dog?  THIS PLACE IS WHY! This ain't your mama's hot dog stand Mister! Chicago Dog, yeah, had it. It always felt like you were trying to hide the fact it had a hot dog in it. New York style, I love me some Kraut on a dog like anyone else. STOP RIGHT THERE!  I saw the menu and was like, hmmm, these all look pretty inventive. Interesting combos. Wait, pastrami on a hotdog? What on earth are they trying to hide? I ordered the East coast.  This guy had Pastrami, Sauerkraut, diced tomatoes and Buldogis Mayo. My husband ordered the Bahn Mi. We decided to share the Euro Special Fries.   Look, I can be picky. But when I took a bite out of that dog, I wanted to cry! It was heaven. That SNAP of the giant dog was what ever single Hot Dog connoisseur wants to hear. That sudden burst of flavor seeping into your mouth. Get me the key to the door, cause I want in! And to top it off, these perfectly cooked pastrami shreds, melding with delicious kraut, the coolness of the tomatoes and the smoothness of the Buldogis Mayo. Kill me now. I've found my last supper.  I could go on for days about his Bahn Mi Dog but I want to skip right to the Euro Special Fries. Great, the fries are again, cooked perfectly. Surprise. But they are topped with the chunky sprinkling of pork belly, cheddar and again, an amazingly smooth garlic mayo sauce, that with each bite, you need to get every element to really appreciate it. Separately , delicious. But together, a symphony.  I know it's crazy, and I can't believe it myself to be this in love with... A HOT DOG PLACE, but holy cow! I want to try every one on the menu!  We also were able to secure a sample of the Kimchi- and yes, they make it there and it was just like the islands.. hot and delicious.",

They were one of the sampling restaurants at the party. They had me at Hawaiian Dog.  In the days of mystery meat, they explained how they make their sausages which are top quality.  Now I have been at their location a few times. The Bahn Mi is becoming my new favorite.",

    "text": "A few years back I discovered Dogzilla an Orange County food truck. They dress dogs with amazing Asian flavors. When I caught wind of Buldogis I thought this might deliver like Dogzilla did. My husband and I had it for dinner later that night. We were so excited, seeing the Best of Las Vegas 2013 banner outside made us feel like we were in for a treat!  The gentleman behind the counter was helpful and offered suggestions. I knew I wanted the Angry Dog ($5.95) so there was no question there. For the other we were leaning toward the Bahn Mi Dog, but we were swayed to try the Carne Asada Dog ($6.95) and  we went with the Euro fries ($5.95) since they came so highly recommended.  After drinks and tax we had ourselves a $25 meal. Pricey for two dogs and fries, but if they're good they'll be worth it.  Sadly, they were just ok. The hot dog itself was the weakest link. These were salty and lacked any of the all beef flavor I love in my Chicago dogs.  The toppings however good couldn't save the dog. The bun was a bit stale and too big. I like a good meat to bun ratio and this didn't deliver. I didn't prefer one dog over the other. Any difference in flavor was cloaked by saltiness.  The fries were an odd mix. We consumed them, but I have no idea what we ate. When they were recommended I expected gyro fries, not Euro fries. I recognized that it was topped with cheese, but beyond that I have no clue what the concoction was.  If I want the goodness of Dogzilla, I guess it means I have to haul my ass to the OC and track them down.",

The young lady behind the counter was nothing but smiles. She even brings out your food and cleans up. When we tried to get for more napkins insisted on doing everything for us. Not what you would expect from a small hotdog joint.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a dog with a twist.",

The hot dogs are actually really good, and the prices are very reasonable.   The menu has a ton of options, focusing mainly on Korean style dogs, and classic dogs (all priced just under $5).  You can even create your own.  The toppings include pulled pork, sauerkraut, bulgogi, pork belly, shredded cheese, and many more.  Tons of sauce choices too  (there were almost 10 different mayo flavors to choose from).  There are also salads, wraps, wings, a corn dog, a vegan dog, and fries.   The classic fries were delicious, and a great portion for $2.  We tried the angry kimchi fries as well, and those were just crazy.  A whole box of fries topped with shredded cheese, pork bulgogi, kimchi, and a fried egg ($5).  Delicious, and very indulgent.",

Layers of different flavors that provide one great explosion of taste in your mouth!  Sweet potato fries, topped with bulgogi pork, cheese, jalepenos, kimchi and a fried egg... easily two meals..  My girlfriend ordered the beef bulgogi without the dog... I had a bite.. YUM!  Tender beef with a hint of sweet soy and asian slaw wrapped in a tender bun. Definitely what I am getting the next time!  Bread pudding is my all time favorite dessert, so we had to give theirs a try. Flavor of the pudding was great. The sauce on top was ok, kind of tasted like pancake syrup. If you like dense bread pudding, this is the one to eat!  The service was good. We were immediately greeted when we entered. Both the cashier and the owner gave suggestions on what all we should try. While we were there it did get busy, and you could tell that things were backing up. However that is to be expected when you are cooking made to order. I think some of their customers don't realize that...   The location for me was hard to find, but not for many. There was a steady flow of customers coming in the entire hour plus we were there.   Looking forward to going back and trying more flavor fusion!",

I thought my lunch here was great, and my only wish is that they were closer to my job!  I ordered the Angry Hotdog ($4.95), and the Angry Kimchi fries ($4.95).  The fries were actually sweet potato fries, covered in kimchi, an egg over easy, bulgogi, and Korean spices.  It had a small little bite to it that I actually would have preferred stronger.    The fries didn't come together so good for me.  I'm just not sure if the sweetness of the sweet potato goes with the spicy, meaty flavors of the bulgogi and Korean chili sauce.  They were good, but not great, and a little bit too greasy for me.    The hotdog, however, was bomb!  I don't even know what all was on this thing because I couldn't waste time on trying to figure it out.  I just wanted to eat it!  The hotdog was indeed gourmet and nothing like a 7-11 hotdog.  The buns were fresh and tasty (I confirmed with the owner that they get their buns freshly baked).  The bulgogi on the burger gave it such a beautifully savory flavor.  A really solid hotdog, again with a Korean style spice that really brought all the flavors together.  Even though it was a decently sized hotdog, the thing only lasted about 30 seconds.    I am not a huge hotdog fan, but these are really unique.  The price is right as long as you don't get carried away with the toppings, which are $0.50 - $1.00 extra.  I look forward to trying more of their specialty dogs.  The service was nice, and the owner was very interested to find out what we liked and didn't like so much.  I think this hotdog shop is going to be a success.",

By now everyone has heard of Kogi food truck, which basically mixes Korean food with Mexican food, well BULDOGIES is a twist on an all time favorite American classic!  The genius behind this franchise mixed hot dogs and fries with Korean food, and this combination can be  describe as a savory combustion in your mouth.  Literally, at first bite, I forgot all about LA dirty dogs, and Chicago dogs.  The hot dogs here are juicy and very flavorful and their kimchi fries is to die for! Chili cheese fries at Buldogies has the same taste and texture as RedRobin fries but with cheese, jalapeno, bulgulgi and kimchi.  A must try for all those who's interested is the ANGRY dog, one taste and you will be brought to your knees.  The only downside for me is that this little gem is  14 miles (22 minutes) away from the strip, so its quite a drive; however, I'm so glad I made the trip....  A point of reference for its taste meter:PINKS hotdogs is probably a 3/10 and BULDOGIS is definitely 12/10.  *** its located in the same plaza as the movie theater - the food all under $6",

There's a hangover chicken soup and bulgogi bibimbap that was OK at the time but I wouldn't order it again. I think I'll just stick with their hot dogs and fries.
