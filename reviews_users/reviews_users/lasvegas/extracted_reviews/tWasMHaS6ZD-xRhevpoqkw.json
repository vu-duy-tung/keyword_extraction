Great Customer service Reppin for the brand. Hopefully we go back for shrimp before my birthday weekend is over.",

Everything was going good until I had flipped the plate to show \"stop Forrest Stop\" to get my check slip.  The waitress supervisor, I'm assuming, came with another server and gave me an attitude of why I showed the sign and what I wanted.  I smiled and said, \"check please.\"  My server gave me the check and so did the other one.  I gave my server 19% tip for good work, but a real ding for the rude supervisor.",

We used to always go to the one in Hawaii and I was craving their Hush Puppies (which btw is to die for). I've always loved Bubba Gump. It's cool how this entire restaurant is based off of the movie Forest Gump.   Anyways, the food selection didn't seem like there was as much as the menu in Hawaii. We mainly came for the Seafood Harvest but unfortunately it wasn't on their menu.   We ordered the Calamari for appetizers, Run Across America Sampler (as a meal), and the Trio for our entree. All three tasted pretty good and were up to our expectations on taste.   The service was mediocre. Nothing exceptional but not bad either. Our waitress was nice for the most part. There were a few times that it was hard for us to get her attention, let alone any otter waiter/waitresses attention, but we'll give them a pass since there were 3 birthdays while we were dining there.   Overall, I'd go back again. I wouldn't NOT recommend this place because it definitely hits the spot if you're looking for seafood on the strip with a very minimal to no waiting line.",

Everyone helped out each other and were very professional. Thank you for our awesome customer service!  The restaurant is located on the top floor of where the Miracle Mile shops are. Very easy to get to and accessible from the strip.   Our table of 8 (gratuity already included) placed different orders, but I made out with the cup of gumbo and the Stuffed Shrimp (stuffed with crab). My gumbo was OK. I haven't had a gumbo as good as the gumbo from NOLA unfortunately.   My shrimp entree ($20) was soooo rich and buttery. WOW, such great flavor! I also tried my Dad's jambalaya and it was spicy! Drink lots of beer!!! I also tried the coconut shrimp, which I enjoyed as well. I had a tempura shrimp and I didn't care for it. There was a weird taste that accompanied it.   The drinks/cocktails are expensive so expect to pay an arm and a leg for them! I had a Corona and that went well with our savory entrees. We were all so stuffed for dessert.   Fun place to catch a meal. I love all the Forrest Gump memorabilia!",

Definitely not bad - the bread was a bit tough and the Mayo didn't quite stand-up to the other ingredients, but overall was still pretty good.  Also had a few Margaritas in the process.

No happy hour specials, no food specials, just an overall average dining experience.   I would not recommend Bubba Gumps if you are looking for good seafood, I would recommend it if you are looking to purchase Forrest Gump memorabilia.   I really really wanted to like this place which is why I have given it so many chances. But afyer going back 3 or 4 times it is safe to say three stars is being nice!

They were adorable. I'm usually not one for franchised restaurants but this one in particular was done very well.  + SERVICE: Amazing. I loved that they have movie themed signs which direct the waiter's attention your way. How nifty!   CONs: - there are no bubba gumps in the east side!!! Come to Toronto, NYC or even Niagara Falls :(   Gotta love bubba gump. I will be back here the first chance I get ;)",

It comes with coconut shrimp, tempura shrimp, cooked cold shrimp, regular fried shrimp, and some French fries. Also, my favorite sauce is the pineapple sweet and sour sauce! Try to ask for more sauce because I felt that you need more.   I also got the shrimp gumbo for ~$6. It was really spicy and had barely any shrimp. I honestly don't recommend it because it was spicy and hot.   The place is also on the second floor because the first floor is their gift shop.   Overall, I feel that most of their food was pricey for shrimp but if you want to taste good cooked shrimp the. Go here! Also, the gift shop is a good souvenir place for tourists!",

She explained to flip the sign over when we needed something. My friend said \"why wouldn't she just casually check in every once in a while, instead of needing the sign?\" Good point. We did not see the waitress in the quiet restaurant until the sign flipped for a refill. My friends all LOVED the food! I had the fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. The breading was crispy and the chicken was juicy, although no flavor or seasoning to it. I dipped mine in the gravy from potatoes to give it something. The potatoes were great and portion size was huge. It came with 2 breasts stacked. I split the meal with a friend, and glad I did when we saw it arrive with 2! Fun atmosphere, but I felt like the Chicago location's wait staff were more fun and friendly.",

The service was a tad slow, and it didn't seem like there were a lot of people dining, but we weren't moving very quickly after a crazy Friday night out. My po'boy wasn't the most memorable of the foods I ate while in Vegas, but it was tasty and I was sad that I couldn't finish it all. One of my companions got a recovery burger and fries and she basically moaned the whole time, so I think it worked. My other companion got a shrimp and rice dish and I think she probably won best dish on the table.   It was a nice experience going to such a touristy-chain and just enjoying ourselves. But, if I could rate the view, this would be a solid 5. It was so awesome to be looking over the city and getting some fresh air fairly early in the day before the blistering heat took over. I'd probably come back here just for that.",

    "text": "My momma always said, \"Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\"  Well, no... actually Forrest Gump said that. MY momma always said, \"For God's sake, Ryan, why can't you put down that Nintendo controller and play outside with the rest of the NORMAL kids? And what the hell are you wearing all that TINFOIL on your head for?\"  No, Forrest Gump was the one who talked about chocolates, and Bubba always talked about shrimp, hence, we now have the chain of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants. They're all over in touristy spots, and the Seestur raves about the one in Anaheim in Gardenwalk. She even sports the sweatshirt proudly. This from a girl who would practically retch if she even got near seafood.  So boy, howdy, was I excited to see that there was going to be a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. on the Las Vegas Strip. So excited, that I didn't even care it was located mere steps from the horrifying (to me) Goretorium. I was going to brave the danger and go to Bubba Gump, and if one of the evil scary monsters from Goretorium and/or one of the sleazy porno-card giver-outers on the corner of Harmon and the Strip came after me, well, by God I would buy fresh boxers from the Bubba Gump store.  If life is like a box of chocolates, I should have tried poking the bottom of the candies before coming here. I got stuck with that one everyone else dodges. You know, the one with the pink cream-ish center that's supposedly cherry or raspberry but tastes more like Pepto Bismol.  Las Vegans hardly need a reason to celebrate but we find them anyway, and as I had just been unceremoniously and hurriedly booted out the door by my former employer, ironically who stood across the street from Harmon Corner and rhymed with \"Bosmopolitan,\" I decided to have a little \"New Beginnings/I Got Fired\" dinner at Bubba Gump's.  Figuring I was the last one there (as I usually am) and not wanting a demon to jump out of the Goretorium and eat my soul, I asked one of the store clerks, \"So... I'm in the store... but where's the restaurant?\" She smiled and directed me up the stairs toward the back of the store. A sign or something would have been nice.  I headed up the stairs, where I was actually first, gathered the party, and we were seated. They explained the license plates on the table that say \"Run, Forrest, Run!\" and \"Stop, Forrest, Stop!\" which I thought was a cute touch.  The crew was stellar. Our main waitress was super bubbly and thrilled when she heard we were all locals (like, apparently they had not been frequenting the place... what a shock no locals on the Strip). She was very attentive to our needs, to the point where we never really needed our \"Run/Stop\" plates on our table. She even regaled us with ghost stories in nearby mining towns. So despite whatever else I say in this review, the staff was great and should be commended.  And with that being said... well...   We started with a round of drinks. Since it was my firing party, I was ready for something nice and strong, so I went with Bubba's Blue Hawaiian: vodka, rum, gin, Blue Curacao, pineapple juice and Sierra Mist, yes, please, come to DADDY! The menu says $8.99, but don't be fooled! That doesn't include your collectible Bubba Gump glass, so you're more looking at $13. You have to specifically ask to NOT get the collectible glass, whereas I think it should be the other way around. But the drink was pretty good. Not quite an AMF, so it won't belt you on your ass, but not a totally tame drink either.  Dinner came around, and I have to say I was gravely disappointed with my dinner.  I got the Shrimper's Heaven, which along with french fries came with Fried Shrimp, \"Chilly Shrimp,\" Coconut Shrimp, and Shrimp Tempura, along with three sauces: Asian, cocktail, and a Cajun sauce that reminded me more of orange marmalade.  I started with the \"Chilly Shrimp,\" which I thought was just going to be cold shrimp like you might find in a shrimp cocktail. No, in fact, that is wrong. \"Chilly Shrimp\" is Bubba Gump's version of \"Peel-n-Eat Shrimp,\" which means the shrimp is cooked inside its shell. Yes, shrimp have shells, and shrimp have legs, which took that portion of the dinner from \"tasty seafood morsel\" to \"creature that used to be alive, probably leaving behind a family he supported and a shrimp company job that will have to do some PR work to explain his disappearance and he was probably named Charles.\" I can't eat things that could probably be named Charles. So there's a quarter of the dinner shot down.  The rest was tolerable. The coconut shrimp and fried shrimp were kind of dry, but the shrimp tempura was fine.  What wasn't fine was the bill: for JUST that and the drink, after gratuity I was paying $55 BY MYSELF. People, I just got fired! Just because I was paid out my vacation pay doesn't mean I need to be spending it all on dinner! I'll stick with Lazy Joe's for some good, affordable shrimp from now on.  I guess stupid really is as stupid does.",

    "text": "Nice to see this restaurant make its way to Vegas. I have never been to one so I ventured in here during lunch over the weekend. As expected, since it is located on the second/third floor of Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops, the location gets great foot traffic from people on the strip or those coming from the bridge from the Cosmopolitan or Crystals/Aria. The retail store has all sorts of neat shirts, accessories and souvenirs and you have to go up the stairs to access the restaurant section. My eye caught the Stupid is as Stupid Does Shirt!  Since I was on a lunch break I did not take long and went to the bar.   The only TVs I saw were at the bar and I did not see any in the regular dining area so I for now, I do not believe this is a good spot to try to catch any game; only come for the fish and shrimp dining!  I asked the bartender's recommendation and went with a cup of Mama Blues Shrimp Gumbo. He explained the gumbo as having worchestire sauce in it with a little kick and I like that sauce in my marinades so I was sold.  Surely enough, there was a little spice but   The main course I ordered was the accidental fish/shrimp. This was a broiled mahi mahi with jasmine rice, grilled shrimp that came with a side of lemon butter with roma tomatoes. I've had freshly caught mahi mahi in Hawaii so I have a high standard when it comes to this fish. The one they served came very close but not quite that standard. It was a generous portion and came with some shrimp which I thought could have been bigger.   The price of the meal was kind of high as well but that's what's expected from restaurants on the Vegas strip. This was a great experience and hopefully I'll buddy up with one of the staff there to come back in and get a discounted hookup. lol.",

They had called me but I wasn't able to take their call since I was in the shower but they said they would call back in 30 mins... It's now been a week! So I see that this particular corporation doesn't care about what customers really think as long their pockets and wallets stay full. Anyone that knows me knows that the cost of food isn't an issue but more of the quality/quantity of what I'm paying for and in this case I received neither. If I'm going to pay $20+ for a \"feast\" I expect to get what I pay for. I'm sure they could really care less whether I ever go back to anyone of their establishments since I'm only one person but I won't take one step on their sidewalk.

    "text": "I'm familiar with Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., particularly their Makati branch. The decorations and designs are pretty much the same sans the UNLV memorabilia near the bar. Walk past the Miracle Mile shops and Planet Hollywood until you reach the staircase at the intersection (next to the Cosmopolitan if you're on the other side); you will see the BG entrance at the top.  Watermelon Lemonade ($10): Easy, breezy, lemoneezy. The drinks are currently being served in light-up glasses that you can take home with you. I couldn't really taste the watermelon, as it was more tangy and lemony, but it was good. I'd probably order a strawberry lemonade next time, though.  Hush Puppies ($10.29): Chunks of shrimp, fish, and corn mixed, battered, and deep fried served with their house remoulade on the side. Each hush puppy was bite sized and quite flavorful with or without the sauce.  Cup of Gumbo ($5.99): I found the gumbo to be pretty flavorful; you can taste the andouille sausage, shrimp, green onions, and spices all blended together. It isn't too thick, but it was definitely not watery either.   Shrimper's Heaven ($22.99): This was my choice, and I found it to be pretty good. You get four types of shrimp--tempura, golden, coconut, and grilled--with fries in each basket and three sauces--Tangy Asian, Cajun Marmalade, and Zesty Cocktail. Of all the types of shrimp, the grilled one was my least favorite; it is flavorless even with the sauces. Speaking of sauces, the Tangy Asian flavor doesn't stick to the shrimp.   We also ordered a bowl of Clam Chowder ($7.99), Bourbon Street Mahi Mahi ($20.49), Captain's Fish and Chips ($16.99), and Strawberry Lemonade ($5.99/ea and $0.99/refill). I did not try the Mahi Mahi, but it was said to be flavorful. The fish and chips were good--the fish was nice and flaky--but at its price, the serving is too small. As for the clam chowder, it was nothing special; it's not bland, but more of a \"light\" chowder. I forgot her name, but the waitress that was in charge of my group's table was awesome; service was fantastic.",

I've seen pictures of friends that have eaten here before and the view when seated outdoors looked amazing. It was! They had heaters  which kept their customers comfortable.

The dipping sauces that came with it were too spicy for my taste, so the too spicy too salty combo guaranteed the hotel sold some extra bottles of over priced water that night.

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying  I DON'T LIKE SEAFOOD. I wish i was so enamored with it that I could destroy a bucket of shrimp and be happy about it, but I cain't.   I just cain't.  Okay -- now that that's done, I can confidently tell you that the solid 3 stars is only based on the service. The food left a bit to be desired. WIth all of the seafood buffet opportunities, I think that this BG cannot afford mediocrity.   We were greeted on the first floor by the hostess, who ushered us into the store and up the stairs. There was a short wait, then we were seated. I can imagine this place when it's busy, and I definitely do NOT want to be waiting on the stairs, my man.   Our waitress was entertaining and gregarious. She was also very attentive to our table and got us whatever we needed, which was nice.   My friend had the fish and chips. The chips were good. Not many places can ruin fries - no worries there. But the \"fish?\" Boo. WAAAAAAAAAAAY too much breading, she could barely find the meat!  Fun fact: you tell the waitstaff that you need help by flipping over the license plate signs to the RED side. This lets your waiter know that you are ready for service or you have a concern/question. They'll tell you that, \" you're in the drivers' seat.\"   I see what they did there.   I got the burger. It was really good, but nothing spectacular. It kept well, but I was not too happy about the price tag. I believe there was only one option for a burger, so I was sour that I felt overcharged to add cheese to the burger.   And what is a burger without cheese? WHAT. IS IT?  The outside seating looked pretty appealing, but it was definitely chilly considering the temperature had dipped down into the 50s. and for the desert during midday, that was a little too CRISPin Glover for me.   If you know you're about to get the chili's rate seafood experience, then you will not be dissapointed. As my friend pointed out, she would have liked more fish with her breading. From what I saw her pick off, it was an accurate assessment of the FISHuation.   ...that kind of worked.",

So my husband and I went for dinner on Friday evening.   Location:  Is perfect if you ask me, the outside balcony seating that over looks the strip is great. They have the same Forrest Gump memorabilia everywhere. Only thing I didn't like was the entrance to (well all the people), you get to the front where there is a booth and the hostess radios how many (fine) they direct you through the gift shop up the stair (OK) there is a guy that tells you to enjoy your meal at the bottom of the stairs (nice) then you get to the top of the stairs where a person then tells you to follow the yellow smiley faces to another set of hostess. (at that point too much) which from there you are finally seated. I think they should have the booth out front and then one at the top of the stairs.   Food & Service: Our server was amazing and very nice, while we waited they did the traditional trivia of the movie Forrest Gump. The food we got the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer, they were good but the pan was hotter than the inside of my crab. It was tasty but could have been better, next time we'll get something different. I got the Jambalaya (which the server tells me its the spiciest thing on the menu) of course I'm like that's fine (thinking everyone has their own version of spicy) it was spicy but it wasn't too hot where I couldn't eat it; YUMMY! I wanted the Gumbo but didn't see it on the menu and over heard another waitress say they didn't have it. My husband got the Accidental Fish and Shrimp (the fish is Mahi Mahi) it was delicious as well, the fish was cooked perfectly. We ended up splitting each others dishes (half and half) that's how good both were.",

I ordered the shrimp poboy for an entree which was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Again, we are not food snobs and this was the first place we ate in the day. I'm gonna assume it was the dip that did us in. I really would love to give this place more stars. The waitresses are really good and attentive. But based on the vomiting and upset stomach my boyfriend and I both experienced after eating here I just can't. If you eat here maybe just stay away from the dip!",

She gave us time to place our orders and was very thorough in Describing what to expect from the dishes.   Our food was served in a timely manner, however in between our food being served the waitress made sure we were comfortable. Our food was exactly as she described. I ordered the shrimp and chicken jambalaya, it was awesome! If you like spicy food I definitely recommend. My mom ordered a shrimp dish that she enjoyed. However my sister ordered the lobster salad; the lobster was overcooked. The manager immediately took it off the bill when he learned that she was not satisfied with her food.

    "text": "This is my favorite theme restaurant everywhere- been to the Oahu (the most visited one), Maui, Anaheim, and San Francisco locations, and finally here! I was wondering when one of these would come to town- what took so long?! I'm a Landry Select Club member, so I can easily rack up more points for rewards (spend $250, get $25 in card credit).   This one is located next to the Miracle Mile Shops, so here are your options: park at Valet at Todai or park at the Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops parking garage- enter the shopping center but exit out of the Todai side, and take the escalators or in our case, the elevator- we're parents now, so we're pushing a stroller. From here, a host will direct you. You will go through the store, into the elevator and up to the 3rd floor. From here, the host will seat you. It wasn't that busy, for lunch on a saturday, but then again, it's still new.   New, clean, featuring memorabilia from the movie, seems a little smaller compared to the other locations, but the ambiance feature is this one is overlooking the popular Strip. There were some patrons outside, but it was too cold for us, plus, our two-month old baby. There were some tables  with chairs and booths (the booth was too small for us- we had a stroller). I can't comment on the bathrooms since I didn't leave the table.   On to the food, the \"Run Across America Sampler\"- hush puppies, artichoke dip and chips, spicy chicken, fried shrimp, and peel 'n eat shrimp, is our absolute favorite. The price was $15.99, slightly higher than the last time but maybe the prices have gone up since then (last year- Oahu). This one never disappoints- we always split it. My husband really loves the hush puppies, it's his favorite. Mine is probably the chicken. I got the strawberry speckled lemonade at $5.99- refills are 99 cents. (Similar to Red Robin's lemonade.) The Ice Cream Caramel Spice Cake was phenomenal! This was $8.99, but well worth it. We've had the other ones in the past-  the bread pudding, strawberry shortcake, and the cookie sundae, but this one is specific to Las Vegas- it's new. I'm pretty sure we are getting this dessert again. It seems like a seasonal flavor combination, but really, you could have this all-year round. The server was really nice, and the service was pretty good, too. We got to ask the server questions about the movie. The manager stopped by to see how we were doing. He even changed out my wobbly chair.   My husband thinks that this takes away from when we go out of town, because we always include this place in our must-haves/must-eats, but I really like that it is finally here, where we live. I hope that this place does well. Las Vegas and certain restaurants do not always mesh (except mexican restaurants seem to pop up when space opens up). And I intend on getting a shirt at some point, even though I live here. We were pretty stuffed and needed to walk around the mall to get a little more comfortable.",

Ordered a shrimp heaven and a shrimp came out looking like someone ate the shrimp and threw the tail back in the batter. Completely lost my appetite. But the manager completely swear that that is not the case and the chef is always on the line and watches everyone cooks move. So it is impossible for that to happen. So she walks away and does nothing to help or correct the situation. SORRY BUBBA GUMP LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES AND YOU FOUND YOURSELF A LEMON OF A MANAGER.",

We were seated in like 2 minutes during lunch time. They were a little under staffed that day so we had like 3-4 waiters. No biggy. Pricing was reasonable. We ordered our food with no problem and it arrived in a average time period. Everybody was satisfied with the tasty food. It's a little above average seafood. I say this because clearly I've been to a few top seafood restaurants where the seafood is absolutely and freshly define. But I'll come here before I go to Red Lobster.",

I'm a tourist, I bought the Las Vegas Bubba Gump glass my drink came in, it came with a plastic cocktail shaker too!  Ok, onto the food  Fries were Awesome, with the sauces. The Calamari lil soggy. Shrimp Gumbo, Yum! Seafood Paella, Wow! Delicious! PACKED with seafood and packed quite a punch! Spicy! But not too spicy so you can't taste, but pretty close, Mmm! Loved it!  And that drink everyone talked about - Great! Bit sweet but that's to be expected, it's a fruity frozen cocktail. I don't know if I'd run back here given all the other choices in Vegas on and off strip, but i would definitely not be disappointed if this was the chosen dinner venue again.",

    "text": "Had this restaurant bookmarked for some time now so we finally tried it for dinner last night.  Location - great view, but horrible to get to.  It is quite a far walk no matter where you are coming from.  You can either park in the garage in Miracle Mile shops, park across the street at Harley Davidson cafe (for a small price), or park at the Cosmopolitan and walk across the bridge.  The views, if you are sitting outdoors, is awesome!  The location is overlooking right in the middle of Harmon and LV blvd. which has the views of City Center and The Cosmopolitan.  Restaurant - Forrest Gump themed.  If you are a fan of the movie, you will appreciate the memorabilia all over the walls.  First floor is the retail area, Second floor is the actual restaurant.  Food - Overly priced small portions type of meals (what one should expect of a strip restaurant).  My boyfriend ordered 2 of what our server recommended which was the Georgia Sweet Tea (alcoholic drink) and the Shrimp New Orleans.  I ordered Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp.  I loved the sweet tea drink (again, it was a steep price for a small drink).  I didn't care for the sauce on the Shrimp New Orleans dish (even though the server raved about it).  All that matters is my boyfriend liked it.  The Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp dish was nothing out of the ordinary.  It was shrimp, sausage, mashed potatoes which shoestring chips on top.  I probably could have made this myself if I made the effort to.  Staff - friendly and attentive, but then again the restaurant wasn't that busy yet.  We did get a free glass at the end of our meal.  I didn't really catch the reason why, but I think it's because of the drink we ordered.  Honestly, I don't know if I can recommend this place mainly because of the price.  But if you are like me who has to try it just to say you tried it, live the experience..!",

The hushpuppies are my favorite item because they have seafood in them. I had the Shrimp New Orleans which was very tasty with the perfect amount of seasoning and tasty sauce. The portion was very generous as well. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the chocolate chip cookie sundae because it didn't have a rich chocolate chip cookie taste. If you must get it at least share with someone else because it was way too much dessert for one person. They also have a cool gift shop with Forrest Gump merchandise.",

First off, there are a lot of stairs up to the restaurant (we didn't know at first that we could've taken the escalator from outside). We told one the employees that one of our family members couldn't make it up there that easily. So without hesitation, one of the waiters met us at the Bubba Gumps gift shop and led us to the employee elevator then escorting us past the kitchen (kinda cool to see) to our table.  Loved the vibe of the restaurant plus we had an awesome waiter too. It was cool the waiters play trivia with your table even though I haven't seen the movie myself. I ordered the appetizer, Cajun shrimp with garlic bread, and a side of fries to share. That ended up being the perfect portion size for me. The shrimp was delicious in the garlic sauce especially once you add the hot sauce for some spice! Fries were good as well.  I definitely would recommend this place and will be back!!",

    "text": "Bubba Gump Shrimp has arrived in Vegas! Last Saturday, I arrived on the Strip to dine in Bubba Gump.        I have been to Bubba Gump Shrimp as a tourist in New Orleans and Chicago. I had been waiting for the grand opening of their Las Vegas vacation. Last Saturday the wait was over.      Bubba Gump Shrimp is located in the new mall that opened up on the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard at Harmon Avenue in the shadow of Planet Hollywood. It is a second level tenant with pedestrian traffic from  two strip pedestrian overpasses. Currently it is easy to find because a lady is advertising it to passersby. At the entrance is the menu. I appreciate it when restaurants have the menu at the entrance. I prefer to have an idea of what I want to order before I step inside a restaurant. Once we decided what to order,entered through the edge of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Gift Shop. The woman greeter nicely directed us upstairs. Once upstairs, we were directed to stand on a cue of circles in a waiting area of the restaurant proper. If you have waited to ride on Disney Land's Star Tour's ride, this is a similar arrangement. Inside the restaurant, there is a spectacular view of the Cosmopolitan. When the weather is nice, the balcony seats overlooking the Cosmopolitan is a prime dining spot. The weather was cool and we sat in the general Forest Gump themed dining area.     If you have never been to Bubba Gump Shrimp, they have a neat gimmick. On the table is a sign that you flip. If you want service, I believe you set it to \"Stop Forest\" and if you don't need service, I believe you set it to \"Run Forest Run.\"     If I was in vacation state of mind, I would of spent $21.99 on the Shrimper's Heaven. I was in a budget state of mind. Bubba Gump Shrimp is a reasonable option if you are on a budget on the Strip. I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich with fries and bottomless Coke. After a tip, the dinner came to $22. Not bad!     I have a minor complaint, which is the waitress up selling a restaurant card. When the waitress sat next to us, my instinct was that she was not a die hard Forest Gump fan that wanted to share with the world that Forest Gump played football and that he was from Alabama. When I am eating out, I do not care if Forest Gump was wearing no sneakers in a scene or that football was a sport he played. I want to relax! By the time I am eating I have passed enough people in the hotels trying to sell me time shares. Fast forward to when we were walking out, they were advertising sales at the gift shop. In other respects, the waitresses were friendly and served with an urgency.     Most likely I will return to Bubba Gump. If I am in a tourist state of mind, I will relive my past vacations with Bubba Gump's Shrimper's Heaven.",

    "text": "Glad they finally have one in Vegas!  So when you get to the hostess, they ask you \"So what did Jenny tell forest to do? RUN FOREST RUN!\" I thought they were going to make us run to our table..So that was uncomfortable, not expecting pop trivia. So after we get seated they explain the stop and go sign to us. Love it, because EVERYONE stops to help, not just waiting on your server..  So server comes back with food and before we get to eat, we have to answer 3 more questions about the movie.. I was a bit annoyed because if you don't know the answer you kinda feel stupid.. even with trick questions like \"What was the name of Forest's dog?\" He didn't have one..  I think next time, I am going to lie and say I never seen the movie.. Less questions. I am such a party pooper I know.   Food is what I come for, which is always good. I walked out like I just ate a buffet, which only was the Shrimp mac and cheese lol.",

    "text": "Went there on a Saturday @ 11:30 a.m or so. So it was good I beat the crowds.  The first thing I noticed was the smell and look of a new building, thats always a plus. They have plenty of space there and the design worked with the location hovering over the strip. The interior stayed True to the theme of the restaurant.  We had a great waitress, I forgot her name but it was evident she enjoyed her job and was truly happy to work there.   The gumbo, EXCELLENT. Even the waitress said \"Bet you wish you ordered the large\". LOL. I had the cup. Beautiful arrangement and quite a bit of sausage and fish. I destroyed it in about 5 minutes. I recommend anyone reading this to try it.   Had the seafood feast, The fish and shrimp, very tasty. Light and with flavor and not that heavy grease aftertaste as you would have in some places. Seasoned just right. Now some would say that it didn't have enough seasoning to the batter but I think it is just enough to where you don't overwhelm the taste of the actual fish and shrimp.  Try it. I would recommend trying every incarnation of shrimp they serve. I have my sites set on the Shrimpers feast next..  Cloe slaw- cut fresh as you order it, not drenched in mayo. +5  Only thing the jury is out on, and probably because of my own tastes...the hush puppies. I like the more flavorful ones,like at Long John Silvers...if you try both you'll know what I mean. But not work deducting a star, When your main course is good, who cares about the side piece.   My biggest endorsement is that Gumbo, TRY it....You wont be disappointing. Well done Bubba!",

Wife had the Bourbon fish and shrimp.  Again pretty good but not great.  My daughter had the shrimp mac and cheese.  That was very good (and rich).  We shared a decent not great dessert. Of the 4 different ones (SF, Anaheim, Monterrey) I have been to this was the worst.  Service - 2 stars.  Only because we had to flag someone down after we got seated at our table for 20+ minutes.  I believe she was the manager walking around on duty (not sure).  She was apologetic and friendly.  Service got a little better but still had long periods of waiting (like ordering dessert).   Price - 3 stars. It was fair enough for the Strip.  Most meals are $18-$23 a plate.   Ambiance - 4 stars.  We got seated at our request on the patio and had a great view of the strip.  It was a chilly night but the heaters were working just fine.    Now if you guys can just work on better service.",

Coconut shrimp were okay when hot but cooled fast and weren't as good then. I don't prefer chains and this is a situation where I'm like this is why! The NYC location is much better.",

I first noticed it had no sauce, and when I took the first bite, the shrimp felt dried and it tasted a bit odd, \"not like Cajun\" I ignored it but almost halfway I had to stopped because I was just in shocked of how flavorless it tasted. When I got up from that seat I felt a bit weird, so as I was heading towards the parking lot, it hit me, \"did I just get food poisoned\" next thing I know I'm on my knees puking everything. Worst place I have visited and I have never gotten food poisoning. They don't deserve a single star.",

    "text": "I have heard so much about Bubba Gump and vowed that I will one day visit this establishment. And that day was a month ago at the location on The Las Vegas Strip.   First obvious observation was the wait time to be even acknowledged or greeted by someone . . . ANYONE! Willing to at the very least say \"Hi or Hello!\" Once that was out of the way, it took a few more minutes to find a clean/ready table/booth to be seated.   Remember this was my FIRST visit to Bubba Gump ever! The food FINALLY arrived and it looked delicious, so I did the only thing left to do and that was to start eating. For someone who dine out often, there's NOTHING special about the food served at this restaurant. The seafood plate was my LEAST favorite! and after about 2 bites of the Fish I stop eating it. For a moment I thought I was eating Vinegar because that's all I could taste. I did my best to try and get a faint taste of the fish but it was NO where to be found because the fish was drowned in vinegar. If that was not bad enough, on my 2nd spoonful of rice and fish and chewing I bite onto something hard that caused a friction in my mouth and brought goosebumps to my skin. Just take a look at the pic you will see a BLACK particle and that was what I found served in the food that I bite into. Needless to say, I was DONE with this food and eating. Brought it to the attention of the Host who showed NO Empathy or any signs that she cared about my experience even though from the very start of our interaction I brought that to her attention. What happened next was my server who came over and I pointed out that BLACK stuff to her and told her I'm ready for my check but I don't want this food NO more. She apologized and asked if I wanted something else. The next person who came to my booth was the manager who apologized as well and asked if I wanted to order something else to which I replied NO! This is my FIRST time here and I don't look forward to returning any time soon!  Believe me when I say even you can make a better Gumbo on your own at home. The Gumbo served here is average! I don't recommend this place!",

    "text": "If you are craving seafood in Vegas, you will not be disappointed at Bubba Gump Shrimp. Even in the middle of a desert, the atmosphere makes you feel like you are near a body of water with the typical seafood decorations - hardwood floor, wooden walls, rustic decorations, big windows, and mismatched seats. There are a lot of positive vibes with the friendly staff and delicious food.   I first had the jambalaya, which had chicken, shrimp, andouille sausage, bell pepper, onions, rice, green onions, tomatoes, and a decently spicy sauce. The jambalaya was a savory dish, full of flavor and filled with tender meat.   I also had the shrimp scampi, which had shrimp (of course), capers, and linguine (duh). This dish was rich and zesty with the lemon garlic butter that covers it. The shrimp was tender and good in size. It also went very well with the garlic bread that came on the side. You definitely cannot go wrong with the shrimp scampi here.   Additionally, I like how you can flip a sign indicating whether you need a waiter or you would like to be left alone. The sign worked well in the beginning, but towards the end of my dinner, it did not seem to do any good with getting help when needed. Maybe this was a one time deal, but it was still disappointing. Now, the server did apologize when my table received the check; so, I am appreciative of that.   Overall, a spectacular atmosphere with tasty food.",

I spoke with my waiter and told him what was going on he spoke with the manager who was VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL,  so I pretty much GOT ROBBED  and had to pay for food I was unable to eat. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TERRIBLE. They need to work on training they employees on CUSTOMER SERVICE,  because without customers your business would NOT exist.",

The peel and eat shrimp had the smaller shrimp size, that sucked.... the garlic sauce sucked, it had this sweet sort of sugary taste to it, and the Cajun sauce was weird too, I can't really explain it, however it was not the old bay type of taste I expected. The shrimp PoBoy was more bread and sauce than shrimp and bread. Basic.... honestly the good thing that I liked about this spot other than my water with lemon had to be the fries that came with the PoBoy and the garlic bread that my waiter asked me if I wanted and me saying \"yes\", not knowing I was going to actually have to pay for it. But welcome to Vegas people! Lol, oh and 3 stars are for the price, if my shrimp was bigger with better sauce it would've been 4 stars....",

We decided to share a few appies and got some peel and eat shrimp and some other spicy shrimp dish. The food was just OK considering the fairly inflated prices. It wasn't any better than anything one might find at Red Lobster, and given that RL is the Walmart of seafood establishments it wasn't that great. I enjoy good seafood, the like of which one might find at The Fisherman's Restaurant on the Pier in Seattle, or Captain John's Seafood Buffet in Kitty Hawk NC on the Outer Banks. I had a margarita with a baby Corona dumped into it which was decent.  I think if you are into film nostalgia, for THAT one film, and like shrimp go for it. Just don't expect to come away raving about your out of body seafood experience.",

First off, I had to send 2 drinks back because the soft drink was just nasty, and my mixed drink was watered down and had no taste at all!! I ordered Bubba's After The Storm \"bucket Of Boat Trash\", and let me tell you, I should have put it in the trash because it was garbage!!! Why were there 2 COLD snow crab legs sitting on top of my hot shrimp, fish, and fries!?!?! The taste was not good! I'll be honest, I ate maybe half of it because we ended up paying almost $100 (including the tip) for 2 meals, 2 beers, and a soft drink!  I don't mind paying for some good food, but this... NOT!! Where are the annoyed emojis when you need them?! Ugghhh!! Oh, I had a Caesar salad too, it was OK. I can't even remember what my husband ordered... a bucket with steamed shrimp, corn, potatoes, and other veggies, but he said it was tasteless! Also a side of coconut shrimp, that was actually pretty good. The ONLY reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the of that shrimp and staff was very friendly and our waitress was awesome..thanks guys! Sadly, I left this place and still hours later pissed about the money we paid for what we got! UGGGGHH!!",

I ordered 2 diff mixed drinks and they both were weak :( My husband ordered the Metal margarita and that was weak too. The bartender Andrew started to chat with us for a while and he later made my husband a stronger margarita and that was a hit! Andrew kept checking up on us and chatting with us about everything so this made our dinner so much better.

The first thing you have when you enter is a souvenir shop which makes sense since there are a ton of tourists wandering the streets. you have to go upstairs to go to the actual restaurant. The walls are covered in Forest Gump memorabilia which makes it dangerous as you're walking up the stairs if you can't multi task.  Once we made it to the top the host asked whether we wanted to be seated inside, outside or at the bar. We chose outside and glad we did the view is AWESOME! Fast forward to ordering our food; our waiter was very helpful with explaining anything we had questions about and even offered suggestions. Most of the best tasting drinks come with a souvenir cup.   We ordered a bucket of shrimp, half Cajun half garlic & butter, they dumped it out on a giant platter so you can grub away. Be careful though it can get messy. We also ordered lobster stuffed shrimp on top of jasmine rice. It was very oily but when something is smothered in butter what can you expect. It mixed well with the rice. Couldn't finish everything so we took a to go box and our souvenir cups all for $75. A bit expensive but i'm sure it would have been cheaper without the cups. Overall great service, food and great time.",

Our server was nice enough and explained that the \"STOP FORREST STOP\" and \"RUN FORREST RUN\" signs were used to call over the wait staff when service was needed. OK, gimmicky and kind of cute. We never ended up using them, though. I went for the Shrimp Scampi and my husband got the jambalaya. Our food came out within 10-15 minutes, pretty quick. My husband liked his jambalaya but also commented halfway through eating it that it got old pretty fast. As for my scampi, it was very lemony which is not my preference for this dish, but it was fine. What was NOT fine was the fact that the shrimp was most definitely overcooked. Ugh. You'd think a seafood restaurant could saute shrimp and not overdo it. Not only that, but I felt the overall portions were pretty small for what you were paying.  To make things worse (considering I was in a hurry to leave the restaurant), the computers went down after our server took our card. I think we were waiting 20-30 minutes for that to pass before she was able to swipe the card. Bah!",

And a message to our server, it is not necessary to crouch down when taking our order, I worked in the industry and I am not a fan of that practice, you were not 7ft tall and we were not little people, just saying",

    "text": "I was so excited to see a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co restaurant open its doors here in Las Vegas. I've been to the one in Long Beach, Monterey and San Francisco so finally I got to check this one off the list.  Lots of walking to get here-it's located inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino near the shops with an outdoor patio as an option for dining. Not convenient for locals who have to park and walkkkkkkkkkk.  We were seated right away and our waitress was very cheery and service was great.  I love using the signs at the table so you can easily flag a server down when you flip the sign over to STOP.  We had three servers stop at once-so service was perfect.  A nice kids menu offered favorites like pizza, hamburgers, macaroni and cheese and of course shrimp.  We started off with a refreshing margarita which my only complaint was the small glass that it was served in.  It took a while to get the drink at a perfect cold temperature.  I ordered a variety of shrimp...boiled, coconut and panko fried.  It came with a few different sauces (cocktail, sweet and sour, teriyaki).  Shrimp was cooked perfect and it was a yummy comfort food indulgence.  The shrimp macaroni and cheese was also on item we ordered and it had a nice smoky flavor.  Really good!  The hubby ordered the tilapia and it was served with creamy mashed potatoes and spinach.  Overall I don't think I'll be running back just because of the convenience factor.  Off the strip the elevators and escalators were both not working so if you're on crutches or a cast, or just getting over a foot injury like I am it doesn't really make it easy to get to.",

I split the Shrimper's Heaven and Bubba's After the Storm Bucket of Boat Trash with someone.  The food was cooked well but not very well seasoned.  It was ok.  I also tasted the potato cakes which were average.  The Lt. Dan's Pomegranate Punch was tasty though.  Average seafood.  Nothing outstanding.",

We ate on the balcony/patio overlooking the strip, which made for a lovely view. They had heat lamps on to keep the guests warm outside. Our server, Jon, was friendly, attentive, and quick (without making you feel rushed). I ordered a pineapple margarita and my partner ordered the frozen mango margarita. They were delicious. For entrees, I had the shrimp po boy, which had a ton of shrimp & a generous portion of fries. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp scampi, which was served with a piece of garlic bread & smelled heavenly. I wish we had room for dessert! At the end of the meal, our server told us that we get a free gift because we ordered a frozen margarita. We went downstairs to the merchandise area of the restaurant and were given a Bubba Gump shaker. Awesome! If you love seafood & great service, come to Bubba Gump's!",

Don't get me wrong, our server was wonderful. Although, my sister had other feelings when asked for a high chair & they never came to give it. But, once I asked for it, I received it immediately. The food was very tasteless, had no flavor. The calamari we ordered, seem to have more breading & peppers than calamari itself. The portions are very small to what you expect. I ordered the boil with the garlic (Since my daughter is only 2 & I couldn't get the Cajun) & it was so bland. Luckily, my sister ordered the Cajun and just like the garlic one, it lack seasoning. I ordered a watermelon margarita and I didn't even taste any alcohol at all! (Which sucks, because the amount of $ you pay. You would expect at least a little buzz). We received souvenir cups with our drinks and when we went to the gift shop, the ladies before us cashing out exchanged their cups. We didn't know about this! Because our cups looked beat up, but the gift shop associate exchanged them for us and she said that our server was supposed to mention to us that we can get new ones at the shop. This restaurant is just a hype, I was very disappointed.",

Just that Bubba Gump vibe and decor, open air, looking towards the Pacific ocean, and the smell of.food being prepared as Tradewinds brush through.  Crap, we aren't in HI. This location lacked, alot. Our server was lousy, unattentive, and you could see him by their register thingy playing as if it's social hour. The Bubba Gump we once loved and wished we had out here, had arrived, minus the Bubba Gump.vibe we are acquainted with.   My husband always gets the Shrimp New Orleans. I'll usually order a Caesar salad (surprise surprise), their salmon, or their ribs. I will say I have always loved their Caesar salad. Their Caesar dressing and croutons have always been on point, so I can't critique that.  I feel like their ribs for $24 is not even worthed. It isn't even that great. It's good, just not 24 bucks good. On this particular evening I ordered salmon. Can we say, dry! DRY! Look, I am those weirdos who actually can bare through dry food, love my steak charred and well-done...chewy? No problem. If I accidentally overcook my salmon at home, I can bare with it. BUT when a restaurant serves you a dry fish at 20 bucks....grrrr.   It isn't a bad place to try. Maybe it's a hit or miss. But I just think they are way too steep for what you are getting. Also, the service we received was pretty lousy. I can seperate lousy service and good food or vice versa. On this night, wholly cow. I mean, from the long anticipated wait just to get our name called, to the walk uo the stairs just to stand in another line to get seated...It just all sucked.  Our waiter got no tip whatsoever and I seriously regretted going there with the whole brood.  Oh, forgot to mention..the husband enjoyed his dish (surprise surprise).   I came in with a stroller and had no problems. Just the part where we had to carry the stroller up the stairs. I could've swore I seen an elevator, so it would have been customer service friendly if someone mentioned it. However, my husband and I like to move quick...so carrying that bad boy up the stairs toddler strapped in was the only option even if there were other options.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly! I won't HIGHLY recommend it. There are other GREAT restaurants in the area to spend your money where you will receive better service and a well-worthed meal. But, I don't like my isolated experience to deter other from trying it out.   However, because of the service we received that night, quality of food, the price...only way I'd come back to THIS Bubba Gump is if someone gave me a gift certificate...only then will I give it another shot and only hope to up its ratings.",

    "text": "Came here last week for dinner. Came in through downstairs where we were greeted and the staff radioed upstairs to expect us. Was seated promptly and given instructions about the Forrest Gump licence plate signs for service. Cool touch I must add. More restaurants should implement something similar imho.  Flipped the sign to Stop Forrest Stop when ready to order and a server was with us within a minute. Ordered the Shrimper's Net Catch with half garlic and half Cajun. I personally preferred the garlic. I thought the Cajun was too saucy, but thankfully it wasn't too spicy.   Also had Forrest's Surf and Turf as my main. It comes with a 9oz tenderloin, shrimp, mashed potatoes, and onions. It was food a plenty for me. The shrimps were my favourite in this meal. The meal wasn't 5 star spectacular, but it was a solid 4 in terms of taste and value.  Service is definitely top notch here with a casual atmosphere. Servers are prompt and kept us up to date with the orders. To top it off, depending on what beverage you order, you can also take home a glass or shaker! Overall the food was 4 out of 5, but the service definitely bumps it up for the extra star! Definitely recommended if you want a decent meal in a casual setting with great service!",

So I ordered the shrimp mac and cheese(tasty), seafood hush pups(tasty), Shrimp New Orleans( over cooked shrimp and the rice tasted like it was old, it was hard and crunchy) I sent it back and my check was adjusted appropriately. The service was so good I gave 4 stars. I would return on my next visit to Vegas & try something new from the menu.",

I heard soooooo much about bubba gump shrimp and was always really excited to try it, and finally a group of friends and I did. Sadly the server we had was AWFUL!!!!!!!!! I had never in my life seen anyone hate his \"life/job\" more than our server, he was talking to us like we were \"annoying him\" for just being there it was ridicules. He would cut us off in the middle of ordering, and talk to the other waiters around him, and when we asked for recommendations he just simply told us \"that it all depends on what you like\" in the tone of voice saying (just pick darn it!).  The food was not great and the portions were SMALLER than expected but the service did not help, it made us just want to get out of there, without even getting a dessert (this pretty much never happens in my book so its serious! lol)  and when we finally got the bill he asked us to pick up everything off the table put it in the plates and pick it up and hand it to him, (if you ask me, he pretty much made us clear our own table for him! lol and we tipped him after! haha) overall horrible experience but gave for conversation at dinner and after! lol",

We went for my son's birthday because we love shrimp and we love Forrest Gump and have always wanted to try it here. The fried shrimp tasted funny. I ate one and didn't like it at all but figured I'm paying for it. So I tried to eat a second one but gave up, so they were wasted. We ordered dessert because I was so disappointed with the meal I figured at least the cookie sundae would be nice. Nope. The cookie was completely over baked and super dried out. Everywhere else I've had one serves it kind of gooey and delicious but this one was awful. What a let down to have bad shrimp at a shrimp place!  Also, the \"garlic bread\" didn't taste much like garlic. More like buttered bread. You'd think when the waitress took away my plate & saw all the shrimp still on it, she would have asked if something was wrong but she didn't. So I told her the shrimp wasn't good and she just said sorry and walked off. Didn't offer to do anything to satisfy us or correct the situation. I will NEVER go back. $65 down the drain.  (Also having some serious intestinal issues today. Gee, I wonder if that has anything to do with bad shrimp???)",

You have to walk up a couple of flights of stairs to get to the restaurant.  Here's what I liked about this place. The ambience. Great service and helpful staff. We got seated on the patio which had a great view of the Strip. Really cool idea to have signs on your table to let staff know when you need them: Run Forrest Run or Stop Forrest Stop. The waiter asked us trivia about Forrest Gump, which kinda stumped us. Here's what I didn't like about this place: The Food.  It sucked. We ordered the Frizzled Onion Rings for an appetizer.  Frizzled is right; the breading came off easily, it was just skinny onions. We both ordered Forrest's Seafood Feast, which were told it was the most popular. It consists of Fried Shrimp, Fish and Chips with their special hushpuppies. The shrimp was average at best. The \"fish\" was awful. Very thin strips of heavily breaded fish.  I've had better fish sticks.  The hushpuppies were ok, they had corn inside, but they were small. Considering the price of this menu, the food does not reflect it. The only thing that prevented me from giving one star was the \"experience\". If you are a Forrest Gump fanatic, you'll love this place. Maybe just stick to drinks though.",

It was delicious last time we visited which was our first time. The waitress was also great then! This time was a drastic difference!! We were seated after we climbed the stairs bc the elevator was broken. No biggie... we took our seats on the patio. I asked the hostess to let our server know we were going to wash our hands. Upon returning to the table another family was seated there as well as at the table next to it so I flagged down the next server I could find and he said just sit up there wherever you like. Uhh ok. We walked over to choose from the few tables he was referring to but every single one was dirty with dishes. I went to the front and the hostess said she would have someone come clean it off. That happened and we took our seats. Another few minutes pass and no menus. I go back to the front and get some from the hostess. Wait another 5 and still no one came to take our drink order. I go to the hostess again and just ask for a manager at this point. She arrives and gets us water but by then the mood was already sour. The lil artichoke dip on the house didn't help at all. Throughout the rest of the evening the service was subpar and even the food wasn't as tasty. I think we'll stick to food off the strip where they know how to treat ya!",

I like the amount of shrimp they provide as well.  I would have given the place a 5 star if not for the service.  The service was amazing before the food came, but as soon as food was on our table, we were just ignored.  We even tried to make sure to have the sign to indicate we needed service.  F.Y.I. They have a sign that indicates to \"any\" worker that you need service.  Our server said any worker will come and assist us, but in the end it was only that one server who kept coming.  I don't know why they say that any person will come and help when they clearly won't.  We had 2 or 3 workers not even turn an eye towards our table even when we needed help.

I ordered something off the seasonal menu. Essentially it was 4 different formats of shrimp (bacon wrapped, grilled, crab stuffed and sauteed), jasmine rice, spinach and grape tomatoes. Portions are important to talk about, it was good (dare I say even a bit more than you should eat in one seating lol) My favorite was the bacon wrapped by far. If you love crab then the stuffed ones would make you happy since they really do have the crab taste (have had those in other places and the taste of crab has been weaker). The rice was not as loose as I like but it wasnt bland nor too salty. Both of my other friends ordered a sampler of 4 different formats of shrimp (3 fried and 1 grilled). They came with fries. They liked the Coconut ones best by far.  The restaurant has a lot of cool Forrest Gump memorabilia and spots to take pictures. All three of us were happy campers.",

I then ordered the new orleans shrimp plate and he picked the mahi mahi and shrimp. We substituted the rice for mashed potatoes! First my new orleans shrimp plate was soo delicious. It came in a butter gravy sauce that complimented the grilled shrimp and my mashed potatoes so well. My boyfriend enjoyed his plate as well! The service was good! Everyone was attentive. We had the server, surpervisor and the manager checking on us making sure we had everything we wanted. Would deff recommend! The vibe of the restaurant was really relaxing and fun.",

As you walk in your in a novelty store with lots of Forrest Gump paraphernalia.  It's like being on a movie set. This is fun.....   You walk upstairs and their are more items all on the wall, hanging from the celling.... this is so cool.  As we are seated on the table, their are questions and answers about the movie.  I wanna play...  Our waiter was a bubble guy named Charles. He appeared with a warm smile and  trivia questions. I don't think I'm ready. LoL...  First questions, nope I didn't know the answer let's just say I needed to see Forrest Gump again...  Now it's time for lunch... I ordered the filet in a garlic butter sauce. Wow....delicious! I was truly surprised that I enjoyed it that much.    Dessert was banana bread.... HELL NO.... dont do it! It was watery and mushy.  Listen not everything is worth the money this is one banana bread I wouldn't order again, ever.   The waiter was so nice he removed the banana bread from our bill, so I decided to make his tip worth it.    All in all its a fun place to walk down Forrest Gump memory lane. I would give this place another shot.....",

The flounder was very plain over plain white rice not jasmine rice. Then there was a lemon butter sauce that had so much lemon that is the only thing you  could taste when taking a bite with a little bit of the sauce on it. We had one person get the fish and chips and the fish was super greasy and the fries were cold.  We also got the shrimp mac and cheese which was fine but the pasta was mini size and the cheese sauce was runny. The only good thing about this meal was the $10 margarita. The bill for three people was $100 and the food was not even close to good or worth that amount of money.",

    "text": "Let me say this first....I loooooove the movie Forrest Gump.  I could NOT wait to try Bubba Gump Shrimp....  Hard swallow (drinks water)....  BUT....this place...NO ma'am!!!!  Customer service is horrible, food is not southern, my group felt we were treated different (I will use that word), AND to top it all off, there is no mention of BUBBA!!!!  Well, as I stated, I am a fan....I went to see memorabilia and that I did.  There was \"Forrest\" memorabilia everywhere, from downstairs to upstairs.  The decor was nice, hence my one star.  I can say that part of the experience was nice.  However, as we looked in the store downstairs, on the walls, upstairs in the restaurant, we noticed there were lots of mention of Forrest, his extended family, Jenny, LT. Dan but no Bubba Gump.  I didn't see his extended family nor pictures of him.  Definitely left us ALL confused, but we climbed the stairs to the restaurant.  Now, to the Restaurant.  When we were seated, we opted for the patio, but as we sat there for 30 minutes with no drinks and watched others being served, it was decided that was a bad decision.  We moved ourselves to the inside.  It was comfy in both spaces.  We just wanted fresh air and scenery.  The patio offers a nice view of the strip.  Great for people watching while you wait on your food.  BUT....inside we were met with annoyance and poor customer interaction.  I opted for the fish sandwich,  as a look on yelp offered some nice looking fish.  I am southern, so my expectations were high.  When the food arrived, I must say, I was looking very sad. I probably should have ordered shrimp since it's in the name.  The sandwich was Cod.  I am not a fan of Cod, I expected something else.  It was thick cut Cod with heavy coating, more than needed in my opinion.  But, it was bland coating so it was just useless.  The fish wasn't seasoned either, so blah!!!  I won't speak on the rest of the food since I only \"tasted\" the sandwich.  There was enough food on the strip that I didn't need to eat something I didn't find great.  The plated food was a bit warm rather than hot so the group sent back a few items.  This didn't turn out well.  As new items were ordered and we were still charged for items sent back.  Well, that definitely made for frustration on  both sides.  When a manager was asked for, 30 minutes later, no manager.  We agreed to just pay and leave.  Never Ever again.....  Not worth the hassle.  Please change the name.  Bubba is no where in the building....",

They're known not so much for their food but for their Forest Gump themed decor. Every inch of the walls, down to a separate room in the joint wallpapered to look like one in his famous house. They've got a license plate system on the tables, a blue Run Forest run plate for when you and yours are doing fine and a red Stop Forest Stop plate for when you need a napkin or a drink. Any waiter nearby will be there to help.  They've got a big menu that encompasses many different items that are sure to satisfy any picky eaters needs. There are a few Forest-themed drinks, but, being in Vegas it's really not much.  I've been to a few different Gumps in my days and the food is always pretty good. This place was no different. I devoured most of the hearty helping of fish and chips in front of me. Our waiter was friendly, joking with us and quizzing us on our Forest Gump knowledge.  This location is nice too, right off the walkway across from The Cosmopolitan. There's also a terrace to sit outside if it's not as chilly as it was when we were there.   This is a nice family place to eat on the Strip with the slightly over priced grub you'll find all over Vegas. Yum.",

Nothing wrong witth that. But just be warned of the strip traffic especially if you go during peak hours.  Everytime I go to Bubba Gump, I ALWAYS...and I repeat, ALWAYS get the SAME appetizer and the SAME entree.  For the appetizer I get the Cajun Shrimp. Let me tell you, THAT stuff is delicious!!!!!! The spices, the dipping oil, the garlic bread that comes with it....ohhh man. Excuse my TMI but it's like an orgasm in the mouth!!!!!!!  For my entree, I get the Shrimp Scampi pasta. The sauce is light yet flavorful. The bowl is big enough for me to have leftovers for the next day.  Welcome to Vegas, Bubba Gump!",

Our waiter, Terry, gave us the menu and took our drink order right away.  We ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizers first.  The calamari was really good but the portion was not that much, the shrimp, however was of decent size.  We didn't wait long and our main entrees arrived.  The food was really great.  The staff were friendly and the place clean.  A lot of Forrest Gump memorabilia hung on the walls.  Terry was great, our empty plates were cleared immediately and he'd ask if everything was okay.  When we were all done eating,  we played a trivia about the movie, of course we answered all the questions correctly. Our overall experience at the restaurant is A+++.  We went to the gift shop afterwards and purchased some souvenirs .  The young lady who helped us was great and friendly as well. We will definitely eat at this place again and would recommend it to friends and family.",

Our server took our order and never came back in to check on us. After 45 mins we decided to ask about our meal and they told us it was normal to wait a while. Shortly after our waitress comes to our table and states she doesn't know what happened to our order so she's going to place it again and asks what we're having. She didn't empathize or say she was sorry. We literally stood up. On the way out I saw another employee and asked to speak to their boss and she stated she wasn't sure where the manager was at. Do not recommend this place if you're looking to feel welcomed and appreciated as a customer.",

I wrote Bubba Gump on their corporate website once a year for five + years begging them to come to Las Vegas....right after they do, I move away LOL!  I guess I better get letter writing again to get them to come to the North West ;)  I just LOVE LOVE everything about the restaurant!!  The food is always great!

Went there for our Christmas Eve dinner and almost every guest had their coats on. It was absolutely freezing in there. When we were done with our meal, I looked at the thermostat which read 68 degrees. Our party asked if the heat could be turned up and nothing was done. Our meals were cold before we were even half way done. Needless to say, our exit could not have been quicker. Bottom line, if you want a great Bubba Gump experience, you need to go to the California venues but if you prefer to stay in Vegas, be sure to where your long underwear and parka.",

And I've been to 12 counties in the world including Italy.  Jenny's Catch - the tilapia melts in your mouth! The butter sauce is so (fat) but good! With some spinach and mashed potato to top it off.

The main came out long before the app and it was a bland soggy mess. The coconut shrimp was ok and definitely not live up to the Bubba Gump reputation! My wife had the Old Fashion New England Clam Chowder and salad. She didn't even finish the clam chowder because it was so bland and not tasty at all. Got a 10% discount because of the snafu of getting the main before the app, but we will definitely not be coming back to this location.

No option, you are literally required to buy a glass! Really? Who wants their glasses, certainly not me!!! Not only was their beer too much money, we were informed we didn't need to take home the glass, but we were paying for it. We got to rent a glass to drink for over priced beer! You have lost our business locally (Madeira Beach) and this review will hopefully keep from others from being fleeced by your company!

    "text": "So let me just start off by saying that we love Bubba Gumps. We've gone to different locations and have had great experiences every time...except for this one. The restaurant wasn't very crowded. There was no wait, but we got seated in the very back room all by ourselves. Felt a little out of place and ignored. That was strike one.   Strike two was when we ordered. I wanted a dish that came with tilapia and just wanted a different fish like salmon or mahi mahi. Most places would say \"sure no problem\" but our waitress said \"nope. We can't do that.\" Imagine my shock when a restaurant can't do a simple switch like that. It took several tries of me asking her to please go double check with the chef before she finally went to ask. She came back and what do you know...\"oh okay we can switch that for you\". It's just very irritating when a restaurant makes it seem like a hassle to do something simple for a paying customer.   After that whole incident I had asked for a comment card...and guess what. They don't have any. Of course they don't have any. So that's why I'm writing this here.  All in all food wasn't anything special and service sucked. Our food was cold when it came out and they just dropped it off without a word. There are so many options on the strip and you can find something a lot better! Needless to say I will not be returning or recommending this location to anyone.",

    "text": "I happened to find this place on its opening night in Vegas. The staff are exceptionally friendly, from the host at the front door to the bartender and other waitstaff. Felt right at home for this Mississippi-born girl. I ordered a bowl of the gumbo and was greeted by a wide bowl with two perfect mounds of rice surrounded by delicious sausage and shrimp gumbo. Spicy, but not too much for me. I also had a Delta Sunset margarita, which has a bit of a raspberry taste. Tasty! The drink is mixed right in front of you if you sit at the bar. There's great decor from old license plates, film stills from the movie Forrest Gump, and other reminders of Southern culture. Also, a gift shop on the lower level with elevator access to the restaurant for those who cannot walk up the stairs. Smiles all around!",

I barely eat shrimp outside, because normally the restaurants don't peel the shrimp shit out......I know the shit is a line on the shrimp back.....when I order their shrimp,surprised me, they cleaned them so well. I was happy about this point! The food is really tasty, the service was good! I would like to recommend this place to my friend;)",

My meal and my wifes meal were $20 each. Not bad but not a place we'd go to more than once a year.",

    "text": "I've been to a number of Bubba Gump restaurants because my husband is a huge fan of the place for some reason.  I find the food to be pretty consistent no matter which restaurant we go to.  This is the first time we visited the one in Vegas.  I'm the one who spotted it and pointed it out to my husband.  He said he wouldn't have noticed it had I not pointed it out.  I mentally kicked myself for being observant after eating here.  The food was pretty standard Bubba fare - the best ever popcorn shrimp was still pretty good, the fish and chips still average.  My issue with this location is the service.  Our waitress came to our table all of twice - once to take our order, once to bring the bill.  At every other Bubba's I've been to the servers have been really friendly and they always come and quiz you on Forrest Gump trivia while you're waiting for your food.  I don't know if this is just something they don't do at this particular Bubba Gump location or if we just had a really lousy server but I don't imagine I'll be dining at Bubba Gump in Vegas again when there are so many other good places to eat.",

Pros of the night: -Our waiter (I believe is name was Andrew?) was very enthusiastic, when he came by and didn't seem like many other waters who literally look like they hate their job. -The food was very good.  Cons of the night: -The garlic bread was said to be out ASAP, but it came literally 3 minutes before our entrees came out. Mind you we had already been waiting for about 20 minutes. -I did not know that at this location you had to pay for drink refills. My first cup strawberry lemonade had an average amount of ice in it, so I was not complaining, but my second cup but literally a whole cup of ice. Why I had to pay $.99 for that, I don't know. -The sign \"Stop, Forrest, Stop\" is supposed to bring a waiter over quickly, but my sign was out for about 5 minutes before a waiter came, even though we were right next to their payment machine.",

The problem was that it was at the expense of the paying customers! (Yes I know all about the Stop Forest Thing) know let me be clear, I put the blame on the corporate people for fostering a culture where the staff felt they had to act like that. If the corporate people were there to check out the restaurant they should have lifted their heads out of their plates for 2 seconds and view the sight of all of the servers at their table and nowhere else. So stop there if you must but if you see a large table full of people with the entire wait staff around them: Run Forest Run! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",

I wasn't to keen on the fact the sandwich came with mayo (which I had withheld) and I couldn't replace that with a different sauce. The bread was kind of thick, which I didn't care too much for. I asked the server if I could just get popcorn shrimp with fries and he dryly replied \"no\". The drinks are good, but for $14 you would make out like a bandit at the Rock Bar or Evening Call size wise. The server never said his name, which was the first step to informing me the service wouldn't be superior or close to it. I saw him sitting in a booth with two of his other female customers as cozy as ever. Yeah, no bueno. If I try this place again, they'll have to drag me there.",

Their shrimp shack pasta is my favorite dish; it has tangy, buttery sauce over a bed of penne, tomatoes, and shrimp. The workers also play Forrest Gump trivia with you. It's quite amusing! If you get all the questions right, you get some sort of prize. When I went to the one in San Francisco, they gave us free parking.  I live in Seattle, I wish I could take this place back home with me. It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for!",

Bubba is turning over in his grave. I had the spinach artichoke and shrimp dip which was awful and bland. I took a few bites and they happily took it off my bill. I also had the shrimp skewers that were beautiful but bland. Service was outstanding. Hostess very nice and welcoming and waiter was very attentive. I live in L.A. and go to the one on the Santa Monica Pier. The food is better there",

Well my visit to Bubba Gump in Las Vegas in April was the worst that I've experienced. Normally, their warm hospitable experience is consistent nationwide. Well this experience started with being set and not being greeted by our server for 15 mins. Upon experiencing it to our serve Matthew, he said \"owww, I didn't know.\" We decided to talk to a manager and all the manager Bud said was, \"let's see if we can speed it up.\" It took an additional 30 min for my food to arrive to the table, after being told by a support staff that my food had been dropped on the floor. When my food finally arrives it's cold and I'm left to deal with it. I boxed my food up to take back to my room. I felt that there would be no help if I requested a manager, so I simply sucked it up and took my cold food back to the room. I would not recommend eating at this location. Not the True experience that I have come to expect from a company that I love.",

    "text": "On my most recent trip here, the food was good and the same as usual, but it was the service and management that really pissed us off and now I don't know if we will ever return...at least to this location.   Our server was alright. There was a couple times where we couldn't find her but I'm thinking they were just understaffed that evening; it was during the holidays after all. When we were done with our meal, she seemed a little pushy on getting us to buy desserts even when we told her we were way too full and just wanted the check. She asked us to think about it and she'd come back. What the heck? Why can't you just bring the check? It seemed like she wanted us to give a definite answer of no before she was willing to print the check. Strike one.  When we finally received the check, we attempted to pay with an e-gift card that had $100 loaded on it and our meal was $91 including tax. When she brought the receipt for us to sign, she told us that we couldn't tip with the gift card and that we still had $8 or $9 remaining on the card, awesome...where's the gift card, could we have it back? The server refused and told us it was policy to keep our printed gift cards whether or not there was a remaining balance. WHAT? How does that even make sense? I will never be able to use the remaining balance then! We asked her to make a copy for us but she refused and told us to simply re-print one when we got home...problem is how do you do that when it was a gift and I already deleted the original e-mail?! No other business I've frequented has ever asked to keep a gift card, remaining balance or not without asking first if I wanted it back. She told me this is what her manager told her to do, which didn't really help the situation. I considered not leaving a tip since I just lost 9 bucks but ended up leaving a decent one and decided to take it up with management at a later date since it wasn't her fault and she was just doing what she was instructed to do.  I e-mailed the company about a week later and complained about my remaining balance that was lost because I was unable to get my gift card back and 2 days later received a phone call from one of the managers of the Vegas location. She stated that it was company policy to do this and the server indeed followed protocol. I was really angry and got in a heated argument with the manager about the policy since it doesn't really protect them from anything, while making it super inconvenient for customers and discourages them from buying and using gift cards. It wasn't the 9 bucks that I cared about, but the principle of what was going on that seemed fraudulent to me. I got nowhere with management and she continued to tell me that it was corporate policy. Ok, I guess I'll have to contact them to get more info then.  Then we contacted corporate customer service and was told that this was NOT corporate/company policy in any way, shape or form and that the store was mistaken and they weren't sure why. They ended up sending us a new link to re-print our gift card with the remaining balance and informed us that we would be receiving a phone call apology from the General Manager once they contacted him about the situation.  All in all, Bubba Gump Las Vegas is run by liars and they did nothing but inconvenience my family and then lie to me about it to back up their side of the story. It will take a lot for me to come back here in the furture, if I ever do. Just thinking about it gets me fired up and angry. I really hope they go out of business some day when this all catches up to them!  UPDATE (2/12/14): Well, it's been over a month and still haven't heard from the General Manager of Bubba Gump or received the apology I was promised. Worst customer service of any restaurant chain I've been to! Would never recommend this place to anyone",

I haven't had this problem with any restaurant on the vegas strip. I'm sorry I won't order your $6 drink but would rather order your $25 entree. Will never return to any of their restaurants due to the way this was handled. I was told to finish my drink before they closed in an hour & would be served then. Well my drunk self would probably not want to eat at that point. Off to La Salsa Cantina we went in Planet Hollywood where we received amazing service!",

    "text": "I remembered trying Bubba Gump Shrimp in San Fran and it was amazing. Of course it has been years so I just assumed that they would keep up with their hospitality?  First things, first....this place is hard to get to. If I was a tourist not staying at Planet Hollywood I would have given up the search. However, that also means that you will most likely to park in the PH garage (which luckily it's free for now on Sept 2018). You have to walk through Planet Hollywood most likely easier to go to the left when you first walk into Miracle Mile (part of PH) and keep walking until you exit the building. The tricky part is then finding the escalators or in my case an elevator to take you upstairs since I had a stroller. We ended up walking to the very end and took the elevator up. We were confused about which way to go but we ended up going through these doors into more shops and saw the Bubba Gump Sign. We then took another elevator to the dining room as we had entered the gift shop first.   My party was already seated but ordering was a whole ordeal of waiting. Once we ordered, food came out about 20-25 minutes later. The kid's cheese pizza looked awful, but french fries were doable. I decided to order the \"I'm stuffed\" Shrimp. This place is not the best place to come to if you are on a diet as everything has tons of calories. I was disappointed to find shells in my food because there was supposedly crab in it. It was hard eating something that had hard crunchy bits in it so I was done halfway through. After they brought out our food though, we didn't have a single server stop by asking how it was or if we needed anything. We were a big party too of 10. I had to hunt someone down for a box after waiting about 20 minutes.   Service stunk and the food was mediocre. I expected more but I should have realized that most of my fellow Yelpers reviews were unfortunately correct.",

    "text": "I love the concept of Bubba Gump restaurants! I mean who has not watch the Forrest Gump movie yet?  They are a franchise restaurant, but they are fun to go! especially for Birthdays and important dates.   The Restaurant: All the Bubba Gumps have lots of pictures and decoration from the movie. They have a gift shop where people can buy merchandise of all kinds. The restaurant area has lot of seats and tables. All the tables have a metal plate sign with two signs: \"Stop Forrest stop\" (RED), or \"Run Forrest run\" (BLUE). If you need your waiter you put the sign in red, and the will stop and take care of you.  The Food & Drinks: Bubba Gump offers seafood with a southern touch. During my last visit, my party of 2 and I ordered some drinks before our meal. We all got the frozen margaritas with a Grand Marnier floater. I got the \"Frozen watermelon margarita\" and I think it lacked flavor. It was too icy and did not look like the picture in the cocktail menu. My party got the regular frozen margarita and they had better luck with the flavor. For dinner I got \"Jenny's Catch\" grilled fish on top of mashed potatoes, spinach and lobster sauce. I always get this dish but this time it was a little too soupy. I don't know if its because it was Summer time in Las Vegas or what but it was not that great. I also felt I needed more mashed potatoes.  My favorite part however was great as always! Bubba Gump has the most amazing \"Key Lime Pie\" its made from scratch and I love the zing and tart it has. I love it!  The Service: The service was a little slow during my last visit, I don't think they were that busy, so I don't know why it took so long. I like the staff is friendly and enthusiast. They do Trivia questions about them movie and is fun and interactive. Overall, I give this specific location a 3.5 stars. They need to improve some stuff but I still think is a good option and a fun experience where you don't have to spend a bunch of money.",

    "text": "I think the key to having a good experience here is to visit in between lunch and dinner rush. My husband and I were getting overheated walking on the strip and decided we needed a quick bite. I let him pick, so in to Bubba Gump Shrimp we went. It was in the late afternoon, but still before the dinner rush, so that meant we were seated right away.  Service was a bit slow but very friendly, and our waitress kept our big water glasses filled and we chugged to rehydrate ourselves. We got the shrimp mac and cheese which came out piping hot, but was WAY too salty. And the breadcrumbs seemed a bit stale and gummy, and kind of just stuck in our teeth. The shrimp were really tender though, so that part was good. We also got the Shrimp New Orleans to share. The shrimp were actually cooked and seasoned perfectly! The sauce was really salty, but the rice helped calm that down.  Overall it was a good experience, but nothing over the top outstanding. The waitress giving us a little Forrest Gump quiz at the end was a fun touch. I'm not sure if Bubba Gump would be my first choice, but if someone else wanted to go I'd definitely be up for trying more of the menu!",

I ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was okay. Never enough and too small and to many veggies in it. I had the Bubba Gump Feast. It was okay as well nothing to brag about. My son had the coconut shrimp. He said it was okay, so I tried a piece of shrimp to check it out. It was dry and bland. The waiter was a nice guy and checked on up often so that was a good thing.  My over all experience here was okay. Nothing to write home about. It's Vegas!?!",

My friend's daughter loves this place so we made some time to meet the last time I was in Las Vegas. It is located upstairs in the area above the Strip close to the Miracle Mile Shop entrance near Harmon Ave. You cant miss it. It actually occupies 2 floors. The gift shop is downstairs. The dining room and bar are upstairs. It's a good sized space upstairs, surprisingly.   I ordered the Mama Blue's Southern Charmed Fried Shrimp ($18.99) It came with fries, cole slaw and 2 dippin sauces (cocktail and ranch). The food wasnt bad. The shrimp was tasty and the batter was great. The fries were good and the cole slaw was just not what I like. The shrimp with the cocktail dippin sauce was good. I had pre-conceived expectations of bad food with themed restaurants such as Bubba Gump and I was glad to have been wrong. The food was good. The service was a little slow. Our server wasnt too enthusiastic or informative. It's ok... But I couldnt rate the experience any higher than I did. 3 stars.  Nearest parking is valet or self park at Miracle Mile Shops or the same at Planet Hollywood. Put your license plate at the table to Run Forrest Run if no table service is needed. Our server didnt tell us that until halfway through the meal... No wonderrrr....",

We got our drinks right away and our orders came out pretty quickly..   My food looked really good .. small serving size but that cheese sauce on the bourbon Mah mahi dryed up and resembled cheez whiz (no bueno) the crispy fried chips were cold those were definitely sitting out and added to the plate as a decoration.. shrimp was good (I could've eaten a plate of those and been happy!)  My bf ordered Jennys catch with lobster butter sauce .. that sauce with potatoes was delicious!   Overall service was a great.. but food was a miss on this visit.",

We were headed to the MGM when we passed Bubba Gump. My hubby had never been to one and it had been years since I had visited so we decided to give it a shot. We were seated right away and were happy to order some drinks and water-it was 109 outside so we had to hydrate lol.  Matthew our server was excellent! We order the blue coronarita and the bubba's blue Hawaiian drinks. Both were tasty. We had calamari for an appetizer which was decent but not the best I've had. For dinner I had the coconut shrimp and broccoli which was very good and the hubby had the shrimps heaven which came with 4 different types of shrimp-scampi, fried, coconut and tempura and fried. All was really good. All that food and 4 drinks for $114. Good value lots of food and great service. What a nice surprise!!",

Too bad you have to walk all the way through Miracle Mile and then around the outside of PH and up the stairs, since the elevator was down, to get to it. There is a Walgreens close by that may let you park there, but I was not able to confirm that. I had the grilled seafood trio. My friend had the shrimp combo with grilled shrimp, tempura and coconut shrimp. Our server was very nice and attentive and had some funny trivia to ask. I don't like how they ask you to buy their gift card for all the other bubba gump's in the US. It seems like they have to go through their whole sales pitch before leaving. I would prefer if they said \"Hey check out this pamphlet it explains our gift card, let me know if you want to purchase!\" I am a local and it seems like the majority of the people were tourists. I had a good time. Thanks!",

I like the setting, kind of remind me of Boiling Crab (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boiling-crab-garden-grove-2?osq=boiling+crab+restaurant\">yelp.com/biz/the-boiling...</a>) minus the sharpies on the wall.  Food: Base on yelp review, we decide to try their Hush Puppies first to see how it is before heading in to the main course. Luckily that is all we tried. The hush puppies was bland and very oily.   Service: 5 STARS for the staff members, from entrance to exit, the whole staff was cheerful and friendly.  Overall: We should have kept walking. We should have stick to, \"hmm maybe one day we should try this place\" and just never try it so it could stay mysterious. But we tried it. We didn't like it. End of story.",

We were quite hungry and quiet at our table so the nice waitress decided to come over and distract us by doing a Bubba Gump movie trivia.  Nice, but weird and could have done without.  We are anti-social.. LOL  Now, the place and the food.  If you have ever been to the Joe's Crab Shack chain, this place looks and feels exactly like it without all the crab options.  Ordered the shrimp New Orleans which was okay but nothing special.  The hubs garlic shrimp were tasty, kinda small in my opinion.  Overall, the experience was decent however I would not go out of my way to try it again.    The End",

I chose the Cajun spice seasoning without the Andouille sausage.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but it didn't have the Cajun flavor I was expecting and was use to and the corn on the cob were hard as a rock, so I couldn't eat them.    My babe ordered the \"Forrest's Seafood Feast\" - Hand breaded Fried Shrimp, Fish & Chips and Seafood Hush Pups. Served with Fries and dippin' sauces, Tartar, Cocktail and Remoulade for $20.99.

If anyone were interested to get little something , they had that option.  We were sitted very quickly as we walked into the Restaurent. our server was nice and knowledgeable . She suggested how much bucket shrimp should we order for two people and if it was too much food for us or not. Which helped us make decision.  We got a bucket of cajun and garlic shrimp. Cajun was our favorite because of its unique flavor. Also got a shrimp scampi pasta. It was very light and tasty. Not too much added thats why it was nice to eat. I really liked the place.",

Fried shrimp was crunchy and not greasy. Coleslaw was very good.  Waitress rushed us out, I was eating my fries and she took my plate. There were empty tables around us, no reason to rush. I don't appreciate being rushed off for no reason and I wouldn't go back, even though the food was good. I can find good food and better waiters elsewhere.",

Before I go I heard some ppl say do not dine in there for some reason but I am so glad I still choose my own feel. And I tried.   They didn't disappoint me at all and I loved this place and the food of course.   We ordered a sampler coz I would love to try everything a little bit. To my surprise The spicy chicken was above the average. I am not a chicken fan at all but their chicken my husband and I liked a lot. Bacon wrap shrimp is juicy awesome, hush puppies and dip fried shrimp were good. I also ordered the catch regular sized shrimp. The waiter asked if I would like to have jumbo shrimp but I believe the smaller shrimps are softer and has less black lines, they taste so good. Also the burgers came with very juicy thick beef I liked it too.   This place has very reasonable prices and good food. I highly recommend if you need to dine on the strip for casual occasion.",

We ordered a fisherman basket and a red white and blue special shrimp basket. We had a variety of shrimp, fish and hush puppies. Everything was cooked perfectly! The breadings were crunchy and flavorful. The sauces were all great too. Even the fries were cooked hot and crispy.  The coleslaw was even a highlight. We loved everything!   We also ordered a coronaita and a spiked strawberry lemonade. Both of those were really well made and tasted great too.   The restaurant decor is fun and attractive. There's no way that you won't look around for your home state's license plate.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. We were checked on several times through our meal to make sure we were doing fine. They also have a flip chart system to get a servers attention. If you need something during your meal you flip the license plate to red, flip it to blue if all is well. Fun system!   As I said it's a little spendy. Our bill totaled over $70 for our 2 lunches with drinks. It was so good that it was worth every penny.",

The place is decorated with tons of paraphernalia from the movie.    I should've taken a photo of Mamma Blue's Shrimp Gumbo - sorry everybody.  This was the highlight of the meal.  I would go just for the gumbo, and plan too soon!  The steamed crab legs were okay.  The fried seafood was good too - although for my personal taste, I didn't particularly for the coating they use.  Next time I plan to do something grilled instead of fried.  The wait staff was very friendly and service was very good!  They even had trivia questions from the movie - definitely a fun place.  The Las Vegas restaurant has both indoor and patio seating.  The patio is on the 3rd floor and overlooks the adjacent street and sidewalks- great people watching!  Man was that Shrimp Gumbo good!!!",

Their meals are a generous portion (American style) and great family restaurant because of the large selection of dishes in each category. They also have a kids menu. At first I thought they offered only deep fried seafood but I was pleasantly surprised to find other entree options. I had Jenny's catch with Lobster Butter Sauce. It was delicious.

I would keep this restaurant as a go-to place for seafood - it offers reliable service, consistency in quality and large selection of dishes. Overall great value.",

We belong to the Landry's Club which comes with perks, ie., priority seating, $25.00 credit after joining, $25.00 credit on my birthday, discounts, etc. Bubba Gump is owned by Landry's. I joined the club two months ago for $25. I received a $25 credit on my card and that $25 was taken off my total bill tonight. We parked in the Miracle Mile Shops parking garage-it's free to park. We walked through a small part of the mall to the outside where we went on an escalator up to the top and walked into the entry of Bubba Gump Shrimp-from there we climbed two flights of stairs to the seating and dining area of the restaurant. We were immediately greeted by two friendly hostesses and led to a booth. We were handed menus. A short time later our waiter appeared and took our drink order. I ordered ice tea and my husband-ice water.  Our waiter Bryant, was friendly and patient as we perused the menu. He answered all of our questions and checked on us often. We chose the Forrest Seafood Feast and the Shrimp MAC & Cheese. He brought the appetizer out first. The Shrimp MAC & Cheese was flavorful and cheesy. It was served in a small iron skillet-cute! The shrimp that arrived a short time later was crispy and delicious with crispy fish fillets and hush puppies on top of French fries. There were three sauces: cocktail, tartar and a thousand island style sauce.  Our waiter, Bryant asked us some movie trivia from the movie: Forrest Gump. It was an enjoyable and unique dining experience. We split our meal and for dessert we ordered the Brownie with vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream-decadent! We enjoyed our dining experience!! It was fun and the food was good. I recommend trying Bubba Gump if you haven't already. We will be back in the future to try more of their dishes.",

When it came out they only brought out 4 fish pieces. We had to request the 5th. The fish was over-fried and tasted oily and burnt. The fries were limp and soggy. It's like the cook got it backward on our order. We didn't see the waitress to flag her down to let her know. We also forgot to flip the \"Stop Forrest Stop\" sign. The ketchup bottle was also empty I had to go get my own from another table.  When she finally came by I complained about the quality of the food. She offered new fries and to let the \"chef\" know. We had already finished the meal so we said no on the fries. Normally a proactive restaurant  will comp a couple of bucks on a screwed up meal. Not here! I also complained to the manager and his response was the same, I'll let the \"chef\" know. That does nothing to compensate the patrons to the establishment for a bad meal.  Oh, and the little scoop of ice cream for customers that are celebrating their birthdays at their restaurants... NOT HERE! What a disappointment. We won't ever go back there again. That manager needs to go back to cleaning tables and to learn what customer service really is. Thanks for a lousy birthday lunch for my wife and me.",

We were able to be sat on the balcony and it had such a great view looking down on Las Vegas Blvd. I am a local and don't understand why it took me so long to come to this location but I'm glad I did. Our waiter was very friendly and explained in depth the whole Forrest Gump correlation and how it worked with ordering, stop and go status. The food turnover time was great and I appreciated more than one server checking I on us whenever we had questions or refills. My SO had a burger with avocado, I can't think of the name, and it was great especially combined with their seasoned fries. For the price and the quality this meal was well worth it.",

In fact, the sandwich was served open faced as it was so large. The shrimp is deep fried and good, though not great.  Could use some southern seasoning. The fries are just typical.  I figured, if I am going to get full eating this meal, I am taking down the sandwich and avoiding the fries. Glad I did, I was stuffed by the time I finished the sandwich.  My waiter/bartender was Korey. Very nice guy. Good service and friendly. After my meal, I took a walk around the restaurant.  Great decor of Forrest Gump memorabilia, as in all Bubba Gump restaurants.  Went out to the balcony and there is a nice view of the Strip.",

I actually ordered the appetizer sampler so I could get the dip, spicy chicken, fried & chilled shrimp - all good. I split a gumbo with my husband, it had too much black pepper for my taste though. The cole slaw was really great, tasted so fresh.  I cant remember what my kids got but I do remember they were happy, they also got the light up specialty drinks which they were able to get refills for only a dollar unlike most places.  We got the little quiz on Forrest Gump (which we aced of course) & thought that little extra attention made it great as our waitress made it funny.

It took us forever to find a parking spot which is fine we grew up here in Vegas so we are used to it but then walking through the entire casino/strip in the freezing cold it took us a good 45 minutes to locate the restaurant from the car. We were so incredibly excited when we saw the sign and realized that we were so close to some yummy shrimp and I was so excited to try this restaurant that everyone raves about, although it wasn't on a pier I was still super excited. The restaurant was due to close at 1am and we got there at 12:25, we had called earlier that day and asked if getting there by 12:30 would be okay because my husbands shift was not over until 11:30. We got there and the greeters immediately. with no smile at all, said we are closed. I actually laughed because I thought she was joking when she said that they were closed. Her face did not change so I know she was serious and we had just wasted all of our time, I asked her I thought you guys don't close until 1? and we even called and whoever we spoke with said it would be fine. She said \"yeah we decided to close early tonight\" She literally looked satisfied with disappointing me. I work in customer service and this is not okay. You are a business, and at that a BRAND NEW business on the strip! You cant just decided to close early unless an emergency and she said nothing of the sort. I really just couldn't believe that had just happened. Disappointed and doing everything possible to keep my mouth shut and keep my anger inside, we just walked away. There was also a gentlemen there too and he said \"Come back and see us again soon\" and again I laughed! I had such a ad experience that I honestly would rather drive 5 hours to the one in Santa Monica then go to this one!",

Our server was pretty good although our water stayed empty once we consumed.  Our issue was that someone from the kitchen delivered our two appetizers to the wrong table.  40 minutes later we asked where they were and they put this information together.   The manager came over and apologized for the delay and said he would personally bring them out when they were ready.  Not sure what that was supposed to do for us but he didn't personally bring them out anyway.   We decided not to order entrees after that debacle.  Our total bill was $74 (had 3 drinks, no biggie).  Asked manager to comp part of the bill for having to wait so long.  He told me, \"I really can't do much for you, maybe a buck or two.\"  A buck or two?   Good service, bud.  Why would I go back to Bubba Gump?",

    "text": "Ok this review is based on dining by the bar and on one meal.  One meal we have each year and have tried at most Gump Restaurants in the US: the netcatch with Cajun and garlic.  There is only one way to have that dish- with garlic bread on the side. Peel em and layer them carefully on the bread.  Then dig in. It is the only way as I said and it is the Monica and Jonni way!   The waiter we had saw us doing this last year,  and he has adopted our style too! We met him this year too.   And those shrimps taste wonderfully. My favorite is garlic but always need a tasting of both.  So- two netcatch and garlic bread alla Monica and Jonni,  please!",

    "text": "We came here for dinner since we wanted some seafood for dinner.  Parking was hard to find but that's everywhere along the strip.  The restaurant was easy to find thanks to Yelp.  Upon arriving at the restaurant the line was fairly long.  We just sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait to be seated.    Upon sitting the bartender was very knowledgeable of the menu and drinks came fairly quickly.  We ordered the Run Across America Sampler for our appetizer which included the Bubba's Far Out Dip and Chips, Chilled Peel 'n' Eat Shrimp, Spicy Chicken Strips, Seafood Hush Pups and Mama Blue's Fried Shrimp.  The Spicy Chicken Strips were great.  My girl liked the shrimp on the appetizer.  Overall, being from New Orleans I have had better fried shrimp.  For our entree, we ordered the Soup & Salad Combo which was a house salad with Gumbo and the Shrimp Po' Boy which consisted of a Fresh Toasted Baguette stuffed with warm, hand breaded  Shrimp, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Pickles & Mayo, Served with Fries.  The food came out quick and that was a huge plus saying that it was packed.   The food was ok.  The shrimp Po-Boy could have had more seasoning to make the food more enjoyable.  I have had better.  My lady didn't like her salad and she said the gumbo wasn't good.  Overall, this restaurant was ok.  Would have gave them a 1 if it wasn't for the service.  Probably wont be attending this restaurant again.",

I had the appetizer sampler with chicken strips, hush puppies, cajon shrimp, spinach dip, & tortilla chips.  The chicken strips are tender with a lite badder, the hush puppies have the right corn meel badder to shrimp ratio, the cajon shrimp have a kick, & the spinach dip is cheesy spinachy goodness with fresh tortilla chips.  For dessert, the bread pudding is a great way yo go with soft bread & a warm filling.  Round it off with a Long Island & you will not be disappointed.  My mother, aunt, & uncle enjoyed their food & drinks alike.  My uncle even got a free glass which he loved.  I loved the upbeat atmosphere & mix of pop music going.  So, for wonderfulo southern fare with friendly service in a casual upbeat atmosphere, Bubba Gump's cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.",

    "text": "I am giving them 1 star because I have to give a star. This was the WORST service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. The service started out good but was progressively slower and slower and one of party didn't get his food for 20 minutes after the rest of us were served (we had to wait 5 minutes after we were served for someone to \"stop, forest, stop\" at the table so we could inquire. The appetizers were good and my garden salad was fresh and very tasty. I had the coconut shrimp and I enjoyed it very much. 3 of the others in our party had a sampler of shrimp (I don't know the name of the exact dish). The tempura battered shrimp was soggy and tasteless and went uneaten. They reported (I didn't taste it) the seasoned shrimp was over seasoned and cold but the grilled shrimp in the plate was excellent.   Drinks were VERY SLOW to come out from the bar. One of our party ordered a whiskey based drink and felt the whiskey taste was too strong. Several of us ordered top shelf margaritas and they were okay, but didn't taste too shelf. The plastic shaker they were in leaked and our hands were sticky, so the design wasn't good. 2 members got a \"free\" cup with their drink, but it wasn't explained they had to take their receipt to the lobby to get it, so that took time waiting for the cup that wasn't coming (check your bag they hand you if you get this because one of the gals only got the shaker lid and not the actual cup.   Our main complaint was that management didn't seem to care about the \"missing in action\" food and wasn't proactive in letting us know it was being taken care of. When we complained, management (?) sent us a beautiful complimentary dessert tray. Unfortunately we had already said we did not want dessert. We really wanted our check and to leave because we had been there for so long. It took forever to get the checks (the checks were split. I honestly don't know if the server was told when we placed orders we wanted to split the checks and I understand it takes longer to do that after the fact, but 30 minutes? We were sitting outside freezing. It took a good 40-45 minutes from the time we said no dessert to the time we got our checks and got out of there. I believe they took an appetizer off of someone's bill and took something else off another persons bill (I don't know what).  The \"missing meal\" should have been free and a free appetizer and no dessert should have been sent (a nice gesture but we honestly wanted to leave and it just extended the time we were sitting there waiting for the checks, so it wasn't something that made the situation better, unfortunately).  Food was generally decent, drinks were overpriced for what you got but the service killed the experience. The \"run forest run/stop forest stop\" plaques sitting at the table that indicate to servers and management something is needed did NOT seem to help in getting service. The concept that if ANY team member sees the \"stop forest stop\" at ANY table, they stop and ask what is needed is a great concept and I have eaten at other locations where the service was excellent using this model. Perhaps it was an off night or they were short staffed, but the service failed miserably as did managements handling of the situation.",

We had one rather rude server the first night but everyone else was outstanding.   The bucket of Boat Trash with crab clusters, shrimp and fish with cajun seasoning was amazing..  Nothing tasted fishy.  Service was fast and the food came out hot.  Only other glitch was food runners brought out the food and apparently did not look at the ticket as we had to ask our waiter about my meal but he got it for us right away and it was still hot and fresh.",

On the sweet side, but alcohol that tastes like candy is really good when you've been drinking ETOH like H2O...Calamari was unique with fried peppers, jalapeno, and some other stuff in it. Super service, great ambience, and everything was a la Forrest Gump...Fun place that wont brake ya!",

But my husband was craving shrimp and we'd been wanting to check this place out since the \"coming soon\" sign first appeared. I wish they had more variety to choose from for non-shellfish eaters. But our server not only made suggestions of what I could eat, he went out of his way to modify one of the dishes for me, making sure to substitute the sauce for one that wasn't shellfish-based. The food itself was pretty tasty, but nothing extraordinary. If it wasn't for the best customer service Vegas has to offer, we would keep this on our \"maybe return to\" list. But it will definitely be one of our go-to spots now.",

Then a waiter who was not ours finally came up and said he saw us just sitting there so he came to take our order. We told him how long we had been waiting and he said he would get the manager. Waited 10 more minutes and still no one showed up. No manager. No drinks. Nothing. They were not even busy. We left without anyone ever acknowledging we were there.

The next thing we know the runners were bringing us our food and the dish that she asked for without butter looked like it was drenched in it. We asked if we could ask the manager or anyone if there was butter on it and it took about 30 minutes before we got any kind of answer.  Finally, the manager came over and assured us it wasn't so she began to eat it. About 10 minutes later she came back and said it actually was made with butter.  By this time everyone else was done with their meals. All in all it was a headache of an experience and was handled terribly by the staff.",

Drinks were ordered and appetizers too I ordered a dip and my friend did too. Drinks come and appetizers too by a different server who brings us out two of the same appetizers. So we stated that we didn't order two of the same things. She states that ok no problem and then our waitress comes up to us and says rudely \"Didn't you order the dip that you sent back\" We attempted to tell her that we didn't want two of the same appetizers and she walked off with a attitude and service went down from there. We had to ask for togo boxes and the check from someone else due to the fact we couldn't find her again. Once the the check came she split the tab which was not asked if we wanted it that way. So now we had to wait for another receipt to be printed before leaving. I love this place but today was not the best.",

The lower level is the gift shop which you have to walk thru to get up to the restaurant (of course). There's a patio with the view of the strip which was pretty nice and the waiter was good. The appetizer was awesome, we ordered the bubba far out dip (tortilla chips & spinach roasted bell pepper, artichoke and jack cheese). We had the seafood trio and surf & turf entrees, both dishes were too salty and the steak was a little overcooked. The fizzy fun and frozen lemon-ups beverages were awesome and we got to keep the glass. Overall, for the price we paid, we were disappointed and expected more. Will I go back? Probably not!",

When we first got here the customer service was fantastic, everyone is smiling as they greet you and show you the way to be seated. After hiking up some stairs and walking for a bit, alas the hostess to seat us! We were sat within 5 minutes and greeted by our waiter. The drinks here are WAY over priced and the food was bleh....... the drinks were very weak and cost us about $16 each for one regular mixed drink in a regular sized glass, a beer was $13...... ouch! The food was very bland and just...... well bleh. No taste, no flavor, no yummy to it at all. I remembered the Bubba Gump in SF being WAY BETTER! Definitely disappointed in this visit. Along with the cheap food and expensive drinks came panic at the end of our meal. I paid with a $100 bill and made sure I told the waitress it was a $100 bill, she brought be back change as if I paid with a $50, then disappeared. After talking to 2 other waiters, they finally found my original waitress and she pulled the rest of my change out of her coin purse, her actual personal coin purse and said \"oh im sorry I must have counted that wrong, let me get you change from my tips\" its ok to miscount money I understand, but why would you have put it in your personal bag and not in the cash register, and why would you be paying me back in your tips!??? I didn't say keep the change and leave you a large tip..... so why wasn't I given exact change? So that was weird and not fun, the whole dinner was just disappointing, time consuming (for service was super slow) and having to hunt for my money back is just a pain.  Spend your money and time somewhere else!",

So when my hubby brought me to Las Vegas for our first wedding Anniversary, and for my first time ever in Las Vegas, we debated a TON on what to have for dinner. As we ventured out on our night which he had decided on walking around and eating to wherever calls us...he said...\"Hey, there's a Bubba Gump's here!\" I look over to see he's on Yelp!  I said, \"You know what, I could go for some Gump's!\" And away we went! The line was non existent and the restaurant had some open tables. We were behind a larger group, both of us asking for outdoor seating... Without asking if we wanted to wait, we were immediately sat in the dining room while the larger group was taken outside. When we arrived at our table I asked the host, \"Um, was there no seats outside?\"  He said \"There's a ten minute wait.\"  Ok whatever... We just took the booth.  Our waitress came quickly and was great the entire night! My hubby ordered the Burger and I ordered the bucket of seafood at Market Price. Food came fast and my bucket of seafood was amazing and so was the extra garlic bread we ordered. We love this place so I know we'll be back.",

I want to be specific because he was absolutely fantastic. I wish I remembered his name because it was some of the best customer service. He checked in frequently, very nice, seemed nervous, and very apologetic when he forgot something or the wait. I payed with a gift card from my work that covered my meal but I wasn't able to tip. I didn't have cash and he didn't take my card. We tried waiting there for at least 15-20 min, we asked someone if they could find him, but after a while we left. If anyone sees this and knows who I'm talking about, I'm so sorry. You deserved the best tip. Thank you so much. You were fantastic. If we ever come back I hope you're our waiter again.",

We were luckily seated in Chad's section for our meal.   He definitely provided great service throughout the evening.  He was fun and very friendly.    We started off with the Seafood hush pups that are filled with shrimp and fish.  Since we love hush puppies, this was right up our alley.   Very good with the remoulade dipping sauce.  For my entree I chose Jenny's catch.  This was seared tilapia over mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach covered with a lobster butter sauce.   Sounds good right? But it really lacked flavor.  The sauce was very mediocre.      I tried my husbands meal which was Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp.  This was lots of shrimp mixed in with andouille sausage in a bourbon sauce.  This was fantastic.  Spicy and so delicious!  If it wasn't for Chad, this would probably be rated 3 stars.  But I was so impressed with the service and most of our food, I had to go with 4.  If you are in the area...  try it out!",

If they can train a bit more and improve on their accuracy, I know this place could move up to a 4 or 5 star.  My daughter insisted that we dine here, so she could get their hush pups. We were seated instantly. Most importantly and first thing, my daughter excitedly requested hush pups.  I selected a glass of Pinot Grigio for $8 and my daughter wanted to try the Blue Hawaiian at $15. Average drink prices for the strip.   After our drinks arrived, we made our dinner selections. We were told our hush pups would be out shortly.   Our food was served after awhile, still no hush pups.  Our server apologized and said our pups went to the wrong table and they would make some more. At that point, I wanted to cancel them but my daughters puppy dog eyes wouldn't let me.   My clam chowder was pretty good, served with a very basic green salad. My daughter said her shrimp po boy was average.   A server tried to deliver some sort of shrimp tower to our table that we didn't order.   Stop Forrest, stop.  Then, after another 10 minutes or so, our hush pups landed. My daughter was full from her drink + dinner, she ate...  one. It was gummy inside. Sigh.  No offer to take it off the bill for us.   We were handed a receipt and told to turn it in downstairs for a souvenir glass. Oi",

Or the waiter that was in a super rush to EVERYWHERE he went (except our table), or was it the fact that he yelled in my daughter's ear with disgust \"IS EVERYONE READY TO ORDER\"...um excuse me dude we've been sitting here for 2.5 hours really you are lucky we were actually hungry and didn't get up and walk out!!! I am such a hopeful when it comes to dining out. I wait for the opportunity for the staff to help turn the experience around...which didn't happen. I ordered a Mahi plate and my food was cold. We never got refills on our drinks until we were about to pack up and leave and not one apology for the wait. Not a place for locals (which I am). Parking sucks and my handicapped father, who can't walk extremely long distances, wanted to eat at Joe's Crab Shack, that is no longer in business so we thought Bubba Gump would be an awesome replacement. Wrong again. Won't be going here ever in life...oh and did I mention that parking sucks and you have to walk dang near a mile to get to the restaurant from the parking garage. Ridiculous",

We told her \"really? But we're in Vegas & everyone has drinks!\" She said that's policy. We asked to speak to a manager & when he came out he right away said sorry we can't let you in with drinks. I said it was ridiculous & i guess we'll take our business elsewhere. He just said...ok thank you! The customer service  (or the lack of) is the worst ever! We are in Vegas after all & the fact that they wouldn't accommodate us was unacceptable! We will definitely not ever go back to any Bubba Gumps again!

I am personally a fan of Forrest Gump so this was a natural choice. As you walk in there is movie memorabilia everywhere. It makes you feel as though the events, and characters in the movie are real. It's a lot of fun. They have an awesome balcony area that overlooks the strip, or you can dine inside. Everything as far as food is fantastic. I can't elaborate on it too much because their really isn't any other way to put it. We were very pleased with everything. The service was awesome. Everyone involved was super friendly and attentive. One thing that we loved about this restaurant was that they have a little sign that you can flip when you need service. Then anyone walking by will stop and help you. It's awesome and super efficient.",

I demonstrated how hard the bun was since the bartender didn't know what to say or do. I stated I'm hungry now and she wanted to take the burger back versus having the manager come over or put in another order.  Given my condition, I need to eat now not later. I told the bartender I'll just got somewhere else to eat.   Well my partner stopped eating so we can get something else to eat. I wanted to leave (and did leave) everything else unfinished so I can go. Our entire order was this awful mushroom burger, water (for 1 person although we asked for water for starters), an adult beverage (the bartender had to make two different once but they still wasn't good) and calamari. We asked to speak to the manager and Bud, shift manager or whatever he is, waltzed over and with a nasty attitude and said we have to pay for the unfinished items versus offer a solution. Bud claimed him and the chef were sitting and watching us. They didn't proactively intervene.   Forget customer satisfaction or service, we paid for the unfinished items cash (surprise surprise Bud we had money for our meal and then some) and walked out. Matt Stensrude, general manager, needs to work with their poorly trained chef, unskilled/inexperienced bartender and definitely Bud with his customer service, managerial skills. I hope they are happy with this $23.56 cash they got for poor service and awful food; I knew Bubba Gump restaurants to be so hard up for cash to treat us as such. No tip for poor service and food!   This location will not receive another penny from me and I generally love Bubba Gump restaurants; I have been to several from Hawaii, NYC to Miami plus a few in between. This place and the management sucks to no end!",

We were using our golden nugget comps from Atlantic City. He said the system was unable to process the transaction.   I asked if he could call the property.  His comment was \"I can't and won't call Atlantic City\" I said you don't need to be rude. He said I'm not being rude you are rude.  I said wow so you insult your guest also. I handed him my credit card.   I noticed Bud Koelle copying information from my credit card.  I confronted him about this he said he was writing my name down I asked for my card back and he said he had not run the card yet.  It seems to be a security risk when an employee copies information from your credit card.   I have no clue what he was writing down.     I received a one question survey and comment box about my visit in an email.  I was truthful in my survey and received a phone call from the restaurant Asking me to change my score.  I was told that my score was based on my server and not management.   I was told that if I didn't change my score my survey would go into the servers file even though I had no issue with the server.",

And we sat. And then we sat some more. And then even more. Damn near 20 minutes of this $hit went on. Servers, (and when I say servers, I mean 4-5 at a minimum), walked by us, more than once, clearly saw our menus, (either open or after we had \"made our choices\", closed on the table top), without glasses of water in 105 degree heat. And not even a single one of them said absolutely anything to us like \"Oh have you been helped\"? \"Would you like a glass of water\"? \"You're butt FUC'n ugly\"... Something... Anything!!! THE only reason we waited as long as we did was because we were famished and felt like some Bubba Gump... We love the Shoreline Village location in the LBC.

If I DID work in a joint like Bubba Gump AND saw patrons sitting for even 5 minutes without water, I would do one of two things:  1). Either offer them water, and get it to them myself, (even if it wasn't my table), or; 2). Tell the lame ass who WAS responsible for that table / area to get their $hit together and tend to their customers.  The place wasn't really even that busy.  Will never, EVER, waste my time and give that Hell Hole a shot at my dolla again.",

Before arriving I had purchased a Slushy type drink at the Paris hotel.  As my friends and I started to walk up the stairs to enter the restaurant Sarah just pointed at me and basically says I can't come in with an open container. I understand that this is the restaurants policy but her entire approach made me not even want to come back. She was very rude and dismissive. As a former manager I wouldn't dream of speaking to anyone like how she did today.  First impressions are everything , especially if the first person you are interacting with is rude as hell. Won't be visiting this establishment, I'll go to one back home Thanks.",

Both meals came out really fast and as we started eating, we realized that neither piece of our meat was cooked. I am not one to ever complain at restaurants but the chicken was pink and raw. The fish was gummy and uncooked. After informing our waiter he talked to the manager who did nothing for us. We decided to order dessert to make up for our awful meal. The cookie in the dessert was so hard we couldn't eat it. We had to finally ask for a manager.. who went on to tell us he wasn't sure why we would be on the strip during Memorial Day weekend and that he would have a talk with the chef. I'm not sure why we ended up paying full price for everything. I am extremely disappointed.. I love this restaurant but won't go on to recommend this food or service to anyone.",

At this point, I would have left but the rest of the group were almost here. Terrible customer service... Please note I rarely complain about service, but this was unacceptable... To be left waiting in an empty restaurant on a weekday afternoon!  As for the food, bad tasteless greasy chain food. And they charge for bread. Please stay away...

We were seated at a table and our server immediately took our drink orders. Our waiter was very nice, we liked him a lot.   We both ordered massive amounts of food haha, we were so hungry! We started with the popcorn shrimp appetizer which was surprisingly great. I had some huge platter of fried seafood, I loved it all. And my boyfriend had something similar which he also liked.   This place is a lot of fun, I bet kids would really like it. They also have these awesome special cups that you can take home.. They light up!

I had Mahi with vegetables and rice.  I was hungry and it hit the spot. The wait staff was fun as usual. They were efficient and friendly. One of my favorite things about this place is the Forest Gump Trivia. So if you are going brush up on your movie knowledge. The prices for food is what is expected in Vegas, really not too bad.

In the end we found ourselves at Bubba Gump-- seafood craving satisfied, no wait time, wallet happy, and definitely buzzed.  I have to say Carlos really deserves this review. He was a great server, honest and to the point. For people like me who've never been to Bubba Gump, their menu is extensive and therefore a bit overwhelming. Carlos made some good suggestions based on customer favorites, as well as help us make a decision of Gumbo vs. Jambalaya. We went with the jambalaya. Best. Decision. Ever.  FOOD: - Deep Fried Calamari w/ Red Bell Peppers and Pepperoncinis. Served with Dippin' Sauces. ($10.29) : The Calamari was good. Could do without the additional veggies, and they need to give more tartar sauce! [3.5/5]  - Jambalaya (Blackened Chicken, Shrimp and Andouille Sausage, sauteed with Bell Pepper, Onions, and Rice in Bubba's own Spicy Sauce. Topped with Tomatoes and Green Onions. $17.99): The portion is deceptively a fair amount. Initially we thought it was a bit small on the platter, but even my hungry boyfriend couldn't finish it. And it made the best drunken munchies later that night. The rice was spicy and creamy, all it needed was some baby scallops! [4.7/5]  -Jenny's Catch with Lobster Butter Sauce (Pan seared Tilapia laid over Mashed Potatoes with sauteed Spinach and a creamy Lobster Butter Sauce. 19.99) : SO GOOD. The fish was cooked beautifully and not overcooked like in most restaurants. There were two good sized fillets served with this dish. My only complaint was the mashed potatoes were a bit lukewarm/cold. The lobster butter sauce was fantastic. [4.5/5]  Trust me, if you're looking for seafood this place has it at the best prices (unless you're doing buffets). The restaurants in the Miracle Mile Shops next door in Planet Hollywood were charging anywhere from $28-$50 for seafood, not to mention tiny portions.  If I'm ever in Vegas and craving seafood, I'll be back.",

I was shocked at how the interior space is utilized so well on The Strip in this location at the corner of Harmon Avenue. The entire place conveys a fun and engaging theme.   The view of The Strip from the outdoor balcony is sufficiently impressive to warrant your dining or drinking here just for that experience.  I had New Orleans Shrimp and a dark beer I'd never heard of with a marketing nightmare of a name, Moose Drool Brown Ale. Turns out the beer is excellent in spite of the crazy name, and I will order it again.   And oh yes, the New Orleans Shrimp was delicious and, to be honest, this dish exceeded my expectations because of the seasoning and presentation. This place comes across as well conceived and executed with smart management and an excellent staff.",

Bubba Gump came up so I told myself thats what i will have for dinner. I walked in and noticed this place is very big and very clean. I was seated right away. I ordered Forrest Seafood Feast! AND DAMN WHAT IT GOOD! It didn't look like a whole lot of food but it filled me up, The service is very good as well. All n all when i'm in Vegas again I would most definitely be back.",

I'd say it was a pleasant experience for my group. Their clam chowder was good! I also liked their mahi mahi. More than anything else, our waitress named Amanda was simply amazing. I would recommend this place.",

Came here for lunch I had the \"I'm stuffed!\" Shrimp which was large shrimp, crab stuffing, jasmine rice with garlic butter topped with Monterey Jack cheese and my best friend had the \"Shrimpers Heaven\" which was coconut shrimp, chilly shrimp, fried shrimp and Japanese style tempura shrimp all with fries and dipping sauces. Let me just say they totally delivered we shared our meal and everything tastes good!!! Since it was our first time there the sign system was one of the first things we learned and it totally was the best thing as far as getting your servers attention or any server at all. Dominick was our server and he was the best! He even shared a convo with us about Vegas and living out there and different things about the city. He was a really nice guy and he loved the Patriots so that was a bonus since we were from Boston. They service and food were definitely 5 stars!",

The food was great, try the jambalaya. A little pricy, but worth it in my opinion. The drinks are tasty as well, plus you get to keep the glass with most of them. Landry's does it again!",

The hush puppies were rather Interesting because they had corn and shrimp in the middle of them. It's was new for me and it was great. The service was outstanding because they had a License plate on the table that indicated run forest run, for the waiter to know that we didn't need anything. The other plate indicated stop forest stop for the waiter to stop at the table to see what we wanted.  Overall, I should of found a chicken joint to go to in Vegas. I would of spent less and and been  more happier. That meal I got with two soft drink was 30 bucks. I  Took a financial hit going here.",

He asked my friends and I trivia questions about the movie while we waited on our food. That definitely helped the time pass. Which wasn't long, because the kitchen was very fast. When the food did arrive, we didn't talk AT ALL. The seafood gumbo was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!! I was just very curious as to why there are no pictures of Bubba in the areas of the restaurant that caught my visual field (and I saw the whole place).",

Horrible customer service took about 20 minutes to get our table some drinks. Many employees walking around and was never asked if everything was ok or to take our order and took about another 30- 45 minutes to finally get our food. Definitely not going back to Bubbas when I go to Vegas again.  Oh and did I mention the forks were dirty?. had to ask for CLEAN set of utensils smh",

Our food was pretty good, the clam chowder and the shrimp pasta. The chowder has nice flavor and plenty of chunks of clam. The pasta was done perfectly with lots of wonderful capers for every bite. Prices were not too bad considering it is on the Strip where they want to charge you $20+ for a hamburger. The real treasure of our visit to this restaurant was the service. From the time we were greeted until we left the staff treated us like friends. Our server, Zuri, might be one of the nicest people in the world. I would go here again, absolutely. Menu has a lot of fried and high carb dishes but also some more sensible fare.",
