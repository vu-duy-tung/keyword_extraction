I can see why the wine is \"all you can drink\" as being drunk helps with masking the horrible food.  I have no idea on how people can describe this place as a \"hidden gem\" or \"[you] won't be disappointed\". I'm sad for them as they may not have had better Italian food or are comparing this place to Olive Garden (BTW... also horrible).   Like anything else YMMV and their claim of being the \"finest Italian Food & Atmosphere  in all of Las Vegas!\"... LOL, I think not!   Yes I know I have \"2 check-ins\" for here but I was forced to come a second time because of a friend who \"had to check it out\". Fortunately, they also had the same verdict as I did. Rest assured, we won't be here again.",

Meals come with white or red and all you can drink.   Food is better than Olive Garden but it isn't the best high end either. I will say you will love it and the atmosphere.   Many popular athletes and celebrities eat here so be ready to run into someone.   On a date with the one you love?? Make sure the little old guy who has to be close to 90 comes by and plays a song on the accordion for you!! Tip him a few bucks and you will make his day.  Love coming here when I stop in Vegas.",

    "text": "I've tried for two years, to get to this place. When we come to Vegas, it's on my list, but something always happens. Not today! I wasn't going to let anything get in my way of going to this place. I've heard about it and wanted to try it, so today was finally the day.  When we walked in, it was exactly how I thought it would be. Old school Italy. We were finally seated and pleasantly surprised to see the red and white wine, already sitting on the table. I wish that was where my story ended, but alas, no. We were given soup or salad choice and the salad was a basic salad. Nothing to write home about. The garlic bread, while plentiful tasted like that frozen bread you get in the grocery store, with too much seasoning. Still not that big of a deal. I ordered lasagna, my husband spaghetti and meatballs and my daughter chicken parm. Well, I guess we drew the short straws, because my daughters was above average and our was not great. My husbands spaghetti was equivalent to junior high cafeteria food. And for $25, it should be a heck of a lot better. The cappuccino that comes with the meal, tastes like hot chocolate, which is weird because I hate coffee and wasn't looking forward  to this, but it tasted like hot chocolate, so I drank it up!  If I was forced to go back, I'd get the chicken parm, avoid the salad and bring a light bulb with me, because it's so dark in there, it's hard to even read the menu. You get the old school Italy vibe, but the food doesn't do this place justice. I didn't take pictures. You wouldn't be able to see them if I had, because it's so ridiculously dark in there.",

Coming from Chicago with numerous decent Italian restaurants and restaurant chains I can be picky with my Italian meals and this place really gave the biggest bang for my buck hands down...when it comes to Italian food.  This isn't exactly the place to go after downing cheap drinks next door at the Stage Door Casino, but it is what it is...and well I dined here after, my friends half in the bag.  I wish they could have enjoyed this meal as much as I did along with the wine that came with it.  We arrived there a bit later than dinner time, there was about a 15 minute wait so we grabbed a glass of wine at the bar.  The place was still pretty hopping.  The  memorabilia is worth checking out while waiting as well.  The menu is straight forward and on the wall...all meals come with house wine - red & white, delicious garlic bread, soup or salad.  Two of us got salads, one got soup - we raved about both.  I ordered ziti with meatballs for my meal - I honestly have no idea what the others had.  I enjoyed the white wine with my meal and just tasted the red, that was good as well.  I read complaints about the wine... they don't advertise it being high end wine, thus why it's HOUSE wine...and if that meal was al a carte anywhere else, you'd be paying more.  If you're looking for a decent Italian meal...off the strip and not in a hotel, this is a great place to go.  I would definitely opt to eat here again.",

Ended up sitting at large bar table and had phenomenal service from an already busy server.  Can't remember her name but to me customer service and attitude will normally make up for any food issue.  In this case there was no issue with either.  Awesome wait staff and food.  Portions will fill up an empty stomach and not priced bad at all.

I ordered the Veal Marsala, which comes with (as all entrees do):  unlimited red or white house wine, a side of pasta, garlic bread, soup or salad, and a cappucino.    The veal was to die for.  Tender, light, flavorful.  The minestrone soup was great too, and the garlic bread...well...thankfully someone moved it away from me, or I would have eaten the whole basket.   I stole a bite of tortellini from a friend, along with a bite of shrimp scampi, and manacoti (what, it was my night, I can eat all the things if I want to!!) and all of them were great.

    "text": "What a waste of $60. Seriously, I rarely pay that much for a meal out per person and this was spent on the blandest most subpar Italian experience of my life.  Let me break it down list style.  1. Menu is limited. Think In-N-Style. You select an item and it comes with: unlimited red/white wine, soup or salad, garlic bread, and a dessert cappuccino (aka a hot chocolate). $24.95 - $49.95 per person, based on meal option.  2. Since a friend and I arrived an hour early, we waited at the bar, I ordered a diet coke and she a beer, and two apps: fried mozzarella & fried zucchini. Total: $34 The fried cheese and zucchini weren't anything special and we're $9.95 a piece and we're just average.  3. Once our full party arrived, I learned I couldn't transfer my diet coke to the table, which was annoying. Our orders placed, soup, salad, garlic bread, and wine came to the table quickly.  4. Since it was late (9:45 PM & they close at 10:30 PM), our table was seated in the only room with other patrons. It was packed and loud and we all felt squishy.  5. My friend and her sister split the Veal Marsala ($31.95). It cost them an extra $13 for splitting a plate (because you get those included extras) The veal was overcooked and rubbery. I ordered the Steak Pizzaiola, which is basically a large piece of meat with marinara served with a side of garlic cream spinach. The steak was the blandest, least flavorful slab of meat, ever. The tomato sauce (calling it marinara would be a grave misjustice  to Italians everywhere) was also lackluster. Price point for this disaster $28.95. These two entrees came with a side of ziti and more of that tomato sauce.  6. Lastly, the check came and so did the post meal cappuccino which tasted like a hot chocolate. This stuff was delicious. Rich, chocolatey and creamy. Nothing reminiscent of a cappuccino, not a hint of frothy milk.  The service was weak, the food was tasteless, and prices were gauged. Don't eat here. You'll be full, but you'll feel like you were just ripped off.   Butt-istas Hole in the Wall is what it shall be named henceforth.",

We got a reservation for two and were seated on time after a short wait (we arrived early)... The ambiance is great... Kind of like what some chains emulate, but True to the name reminded me of some of the authentic hole in the wall spots back in Chicago... Anything feeling authentic in Vegas is a welcome treat.  Wine and garlic bread were brought to the table right away and we ordered shortly after. I got the special - a grilled swordfish over pasta and my wife got the cioppino. We enjoyed the as accordion player (who's been wandering table to table for 33 years!) while eating our soup and salad.  Salad was a petty basic house salad with salami and a hunk of cheese in it. The ministoni soup was really great.  Both our dishes were large and quite good.  The after dinner \"cappuccino\" was nice but not really deserving the name... More like a hot cocoa with a splash of espresso in there. Wasn't bad though.  I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone visiting Las Vegas that wants a nice Italian meal (with plenty of wine) near the strip.",

You go because there is a ton of fun crap to look at on the wall.  And because you can be loud and obnoxious.    You go because Dobby the house elf from Harry Potter, who your grandma would find disturbing yet oddly charming, will come by and play you a 10 second song made up on the spot and demand immediate payment  But mostly, you go because it comes with UNLIMITED TABLE WINE.  Not good wine.  But drinkable wine with presumably some alcohol in it.  The food was not bad.  It just wasn't good.  The portions are large.  I won't go into detail because you will probably go anyway and find out for yourself.   Maybe go when you need to absorb fifteen martinis?  There is a TV or several in the bar area where you can stand with beers and yell \"GO [MY FAVORITE SPORTS TEAM].\"",

Then when they seat you it's not one big open restaurant it's kinda sectional stations kind interesting but seems not private. They give you free house red or white wine which was decent I mean come on its free. The over all experience was nice I'd recommend it to anyone.",

Before your meal, they serve you you get a choice of soup or salad (I got the salad, yes it was amazing), including the most delicious garlic bread ever (puts olive garden to SHAME), and for dessert included a cappuccino. I'm not a fan of cappuccino's but it tasted just like chocolate milk, I couldn't even taste the coffee-ness.  Like I said, it's unfortunate I live a 5-hour plane ride away. But when I'm back.. I'll be sure to spend money there, again! Next time I'll be smart enough to call in for a reservation.  I guess I should tell you about my service as well, GREAT.",

Back in the day - and we're talking mid to late 1980s, I remember Battista's as offering pretty good dishes. Maybe this has to do with the changes elsewhere. Used to be that Vegas wasn't a foodie's delight - just the opposite, in fact. Nowadays, though, you can get top cuisine with hardly any effort. We were able to get into Olives, for instance, on a day's notice.  But back to Battista. The minestrone was lukewarm and my pasta dish was tasteless & overcooked.  My wife ordered the scampi and it was similarly a horror show. True, the garlic bread was delish but that's little consolation for what was an utterly forgettable meal.  Too bad. I pine for the old Battista's. Then again, maybe it only existed in my imagination.  In any case, if you want Italian, go elsewhere. This place survives on its (fast-fading) reputation",

Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals - lots of food as all dishes come with salad, bread and unlimited wine! :)  I got the meatballs.

    "text": "Synopsis: Want a respite from the Strip? Here's a cozy place that serves up generous portions of Italian food. Menu is all inclusive and the prices are just as hearty as the dishes you're eating.  Unabridged:\"Hole in the Plaza\" would be a more appropriate title, but who cares when their front door is made from a huge wine barrel? There are several signs advising reservations but our party of two was seated within five minutes on a weekday night.   Pick your entree from the many menus posted on the walls. Just because you went a block off the strip doesn't mean prices are cheaper, but they do include their well-known bottomless wine. One sip of the red (or white) wine will tell you that it is not choice but you can drink copious amounts of it. Get into the Vegas spirit and try to finish your carafe, you could even pour it over your head for a wine shower. It's bottomless so they'll bring you another.   Garlic bread - our first basket was a bit stale but the second one was fresh, warm, and delicious. I went with the minestrone as my appy, my companion went for the salad. The salad was a bit of a let-down, iceberg lettuce and a bit of sliced veggies on top. The soup was hot and while it wasn't astounding, it was a nice starter. My eggplant parm was a huge slab of eggplant/cheesy goodness on a plate. Perhaps it's because I had skipped lunch that day but I was satisfied with my meal. My dining partner got about 2/3 through her lasagna, then threw in the towel.   I don't care for coffee, but I passed my cappuccino to my companion who happily polished off two. She said they were very good.    Taste-wise Battista's is like a hybrid of Olive Garden and Bucca. Decor-wise it's a bit like a time capsule: signed pics framed on the walls, memorabilia, and the friendly booths that are comfortably broken in from patrons over the years. Our server was cordial and down-to-earth which was refreshing after dealing with aspiring showgirl/gold-digger waitresses earlier in the day. There was an accordion player who we found slightly annoying but the regulars kept requesting him to play bits of songs sprinkled with corny jokes. (I know, I know, I'm heartless cause I didn't find this elderly man's vocation engaging, but I'm trying to chat with my fam while stuffing my face. Accordion's gotta go.)  For a memorable experience and laid back surroundings, this is it. For mind-blowing Italian cuisine, you may want to look elsewhere. Vegetarians - you're limited to several pasta choices and the eggplant parm. Vegans - pasta pomodoro: that's it.",

Completing the interior decor is the dinner menu, printed in large print on each wall.  Traditionally, I choose chicken Parmesan whenever I eat at an Italian restaurant for the first time; tonight was no different.  The dish came with a side of penne with red sauce and spinach.  It wasn't the best ever but it wasn't the Olive Garden.  Next trip to Vegas, I will pop in this place again.",

The food was average, and the atmosphere was dull, except for an old geezer who was going around all the tables playing a few chords of the same melody - quite annoying after the first couple of renditions. This is adequate but not at all great. Far better options for good Italian food in Vegas. Not going to be returning.",

    "text": "The first time we went here, it was one of my favorite stops to eat at in Sin City. But after our last visit, the novelty has kind of wore off. Battista's is located about a block off of the strip behind the Flamingo. Plenty of parking right by the door. Expect a little wait, but it's worth it. We usually pass the time by stopping at the dive bar in the same parking lot for a couple cheap PBRs.  Like other reviewers have noted, it is a bit overpriced. You can expect to pay in the neighborhood of $60 with tip for two adults. But hey, it's Las Vegas, who cares!? You wont leave hungry or without being at least mildly buzzed. My wife usually gets fettucini and I'll order Spaghetti and Meatballs. As soon as your wait-staff approaches your table you are offered a craft of house wine. Its good enough, you wont be disappointed. The garlic bread is very very good and i'm usually not that generous with garlic bread. My wife gave the salad a thumbs up and you can sub applesauce for the picky eater in your crowd. The entree portions are large and we have no complaints with the food at all. The complimentary desert Cappuccino is AWESOME. I don't drink coffee or cappuccino and I love it.  I think its closer to hot chocolate than any kind of coffee/cappuccino. But seriously, it's a tasty way to round out the meal.  The biggest bummer is the increasingly creepy accordion player. The first time we went to Battista's we were entertained and thought it was a neat touch, the rest of my family loved him as well. He'll ask you where you're from, pretend to play a song associated with that place and mumble out-of-tune some lyrics for 20-30 seconds and then stand there uncomfortably until he sees some money. I didn't really have a problem until our last visit. Being that we were on vacation, I didn't have any bills smaller than a $50. We hoped to avoid him, but he was unavoidable. Once he was done singing his 20 second off-key rendition of \"Back home again in Indiana\", we thanked him as he tapped on the money clip on his Accordion. I explained that we appreciated it and we would catch him later in the night once we paid our bill. We got a snide, \"Well I guess we'll just see about that\" back at us. Super awkward and embarrassing moment in front of my wife and others seated near by. Really!? We're here eating $30 plates of spaghetti, do you really think i'm trying to cheat you out of a couple bucks for a tip? We're on vacation and only have large bills/credit cards. Once we paid our bill my wife tracked him down and gave him a tip, but made sure to tell him how disappointing he made our stop.  It wasn't until I read a few reviews on here that I found out I was not alone. We decided we're just going to decline as soon as he steps up to our table if we go back in the future. Though it would be fun to try out some new places and see if he has a song for Madagascar, Bokoro, or somewhere else equally obscure.  I'm not saying I wouldn't recommend this place to someone else, but the accordion guy can suck one. If you try somewhere exotic, post and let me know what he plays.",

We were seated on a two seater tabel in the corner. It was of course crowded because it was a holiday. The tables were a little too close for my comfort, but the food was awesome. Dinner came with your choice of complimentary house red or white wine. I had the clam linguini with white wine sauce and my partner had the chicken alfredo. Both were delicious and I was full, but stuffed my face to finish it, I HAD TO! It was too good to take home for later....... plus we wer on our way to a concert that day. We finished up with a complimentary cappuccino and went on our way. Good value for quality of food and service.",

A week before the trip, my dentist told me I absolutely had to go to Battista's.  Sure thing.  Then-boyfriend and I checked it out.  We thought it was great.  Fast forward four years... my brother is now living in Vegas, and my immediate family decided to meet there for Christmas.  Having remembered my wonderful experience at this restaurant, I decided we should all go.  BIG mistake.  The wine tasted like 2-buck Chuck that had been opened five days before.  The salad was comprised of iceberg lettuce and topped off with a hunk of salami.  I'm pretty sure the sauce was Ragu.  My brother, an erstwhile captain in the Army, said he'd rather have an MRE (meal ready to eat) than dine at Battista's again.  The little man playing the accordion knew the Ohio State fight song.  Battista's better hang onto that guy - it's the only reason they even get a star.",

And right in the middle of the strip no less! What a find!  Old Las Vegas adorns the walls, wine casks abound, a dark, busy and welcoming interior, matched by a staff that's used to managing and shepherding packed packed crowds day in and day out.  You can eat in the bar area, wait for a table with drinks, or stand around and read the short menu until your reservation comes around. Either way, there's lots to see and take in.  The menu is simple, and contains simple Italian food. And yes, everything comes with bread, wine, and soup or salad. What a treat!  For $30, Sarah and I stuffed ourselves by splitting the Lasagna, the salad, basket of bread, and three carafes of wine. Including tip! What a steal, as I said, in the middle of the strip! All the menu says is that there's a $10 minimum per person, so why not split all that yummy simple Italian food!  This was one of our favorite meals from our last trip. The energy, the location. It was a truly old school Vegas experience. Imagine what it was like when Battista's was just one of a few options along the strip of smaller hotel/gambling outlets.... oh yeah, it was just like this, busy, dark, and simple.",

Please, keep in mind that the wine will not be the best you have ever had. In fact, I think they changed it? Or maybe my taste in wine has evolved since the last time I drank it. The garlic bread is so good! I could have eaten that all night. The salad is large and the dressing is flavorful.  I had the eggplant parmesan and LOVED every part of it. My roommate had the lasagna and ate every bite. The cappuccino at the end taste more like hot chocolate but it's a perfect end cap to a great dinner.  Everything is always fast here. Even the food.

I think this was our favorite of the week. Our shuttle driver from the airport recommended it. I've seen the restaurant on previous trips but the exterior wasn't anything to write home about.   If you like the atmosphere of \"dark bars\" you'll love this place. Easy to get a table for two on a Monday night. My GF appreciated the carafe of house wine brought to the table (I don't drink but she enjoyed a few glasses with dinner.   Menus are brought to the table but everything is posted on boards on the wall. Simple, but tasty. We had eggplant parm, and like Ned C. stated, the sauce could have used a little kick, but I do understand that you have to compromise for your guests.   Service was very good. I would have like to see the server at the table more, but his assistant was charming and made up for it so we never had to look for staff when we needed something.  Our bill for two people was reasonable, and if we had had the time would have stopped in again.  Later in the week a couple locals recommended this place to us. I imagine that it has a good local following.",

They couldn't care less if we left or stayed when they quoted us a 1.5 hour wait.   Luckily, they managed to inform us that the bar area was open seating, and there were 2 seats available at a high top. The only drawback to this area is that the menu is a lot smaller. We both just wanted Spaghetti and Meatballs, so we went for it. Our server in the bar was awesome. I wish I remembered her name because she was friendly and quick to get us our food.   The meal was average, but just right after a day of drinking. If I wanted something quick to coat my belly, I would come back and sit at the bar.

The lineup is a long one during dinner, even on a weekday (in the middle of January too!!, but waited it out anyway!  I had the spaghetti and meatball. Enjoyed the atmosphere, and the roaming accordion player (tip them!).",

House wine is served to start, both white and red. Mediocre quality, but good enough for free. Salad served before dinner was great! Fresh and had an amazing house dressing. Garlic bread was flavorful as well. I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce, very good. Healthy portion. Meal was finished with a cappuccino, also good.",

Well that reflected in the less than 10 percent tip. Soup tasted like the canned soup and worse was the sauce omg dark sweet sauce with no flavor. What does it take to whip up a simple marinara!!!! Not much olive oil garlic and some fresh tomatoes. For the price this place sucked. I could have bought a can of chef boyardee that tasted better for 1.25. What a disappointment. Worst off I tried to tell the manager on the way out and he could care less. Please don't waste your time and money on this place there are a million other places in Vegas to eat at that price.",

    "text": "OK, where to start.....  I appreciate independent family restaurants, and in most cases they cook with recipes passed down through generations.   This IS NOT that place. The kitschy decor with old memorabilia gives the air of a certain authenticity and non commercialized feel unlike the rest of the strip. The food however is a completely different story.   I am shocked by the amount of 5 star reviews! I have come to the following conclusion, either these reviewers are:  1. Friends and family 2. Have never eaten in a restaurant better than a McDonalds  3. Don't know how to cook from scratch 4. Exclusively eat Stouffer's freezer lasagna and \"make\" pasta by boiling dry noodles and pouring Ragu jar sauce over top.  5. Have recently taken part in Las Vegas' new legal marijuana laws before going out for dinner  6. Are completely sloshed from the cheap \"house wine\" they serve BEFORE they serve you precooked low quality and mass produced food.   I am still in awe that the place was full and kept turning over tables. I can't imagine that any of the diners, (us included) could have ever been repeat customers.   There is excellent food in Las Vegas. If a celebrity chef restaurant is too pricey, do yourself a favour and go to something like Maggianos where although it's a chain, the food is actually good.",

    "text": "I'm giving this establishment a solid three stars. I have been told about this restaurant by others who really seemed to enjoy the food and the ambience. This is not a chain restaurant and it is off strip so I did not know what to expect. However, I have eaten at places such as Olive Garden and Maggianos enough to have a certain expectation. Unfortunately our expectations were not met.  When we first entered, we noticed that the lighting was low and it became very evident once we were seated. Not only was it dim but the lights themselves are orange in color casting that orange lowly light over everything.  The menus are on the wall and most of your meals include soup or salad, the entree, a side of pasta and a cappuccino.  We decided to split the chicken Parmesan for $30. When you split a meal they will tack on the additional charge. For our trip it was an extra $13 to cover the second person. My wife had the salad with Italian dressing and I tried the minestrone soup. Both were fairly plain. They tasted OK but nothing to write home about. Garlic bread also was decent but I would've traded for some OG breadsticks.  The entree portion was nice and large. We expected a good size portion that we could split. They say the chicken comes out at 10 ounces which is fine because we each are comfortable having about five or 6 ounces of meat separately. It tasted pretty good but seemed a little thick and heavy. The side of pasta seem like something my eight-year-old would give me at home. The pasta itself was cooked al dente but had no flavor. The sauce on top was probably homemade and tasted good but not good enough to finish the small side portion.  During your dinner you have your choice of white or red house wine. We tried the red wine first and our impression was that we were drinking communion wine at church. So we decided to try the white which was lighter in tone and had a little more fruit on the nose. Both wines could have been third crush. I would not have paid separately for these wines but they were included as part of the meal.  My wife and I both agree that the best part of the entire meal were the cappuccinos at the end. My wife doesn't drink coffee but she really enjoyed these drinks. They tasted more like hot chocolate then True cappuccino.  About four hours after the meal my wife wasn't feeling so good. She had an upset stomach which could've been a result of not being used to acidic red sauces.  I'm glad we visited just so that we can say we been there.",

Pasta over cooked (penne and spaghetti) the lasagna tasted like it was days old and pasta in it very over cooked and pasty the veal was also over cooked and lacked flavor.  The red sauce was bland and terrible.  I suggest taking your money elsewhere.  Or perhaps even buying some Prego or Newman's Own sauce would be far better than this place.  I thought it was good when I went prior to this about 5 years ago but was really drunk and it probably wasn't as good as I thought previously.  Bad food and overpriced as a result.",

    "text": "I don't even know where to start with this one.... The location of this restaurant isn't bad at all. Easy to find, Uber and Taxi knew where it was. One problem we encountered on the way out was that Uber does not let drivers pick up from this parking lot... That was odd. So we had to walk over to the Linq and order a taxi there. Battista's really wants to live up to their name Hole In The Wall! haha Inside the restaurant is loud and dark! The menus are posted on the walls, so if you have trouble seeing in the dark good luck ordering. The night my friends and I visited this establishment there were a couple of large parties and other normal sized tables. The service here was slower than molasses. With that being said our waitress was actually very helpful and prompt. (I really wish I remembered her name... She is the reason I'm not giving lower than a 3 star on my review) The \"salad\" that is servered before your entree isn't really \"Italian\".... It was just a bunch of vegetables and stuff thrown into a bowl. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. That wasn't bad, but my friends got some other items and their food wasn't good. For food it was alright, but for what the advertised Italian food was, was terrible... Also during the meal they offer free white or red wine if you are over the age of 21. Nice gesture, but no thanks. The white was watered down and the red was freezing cold! (Freezing cold as in the serving temp of white wines cold) At the end of the meal you get a nice cup of cappuccino...... I wish that was the case. It's really more like a cup of really chocolaty hot cocoa. (Which was actually really good though!) But after my first experience coming here I don't think I will be joining the staff at Battista's for dinner anytime in the foreseeable future. After all Vegas has plenty of food spots to try every new trip out for me.",

It's authentic in the sense that it tastes like the Italian you get from someone who is a decent cook, but not originally from Italy. I had the chicken parm and my hubby had the lasagna. They were both very large portions with a deep maroon red sauce. The chicken was tender with tons of cheese and the lasagna wasn't overly heavy. It comes with a very nice salad with salami! And all the free wine you can drink. The wine was sweet and maybe a little watered down, but I still left with a buzz despite the amount of food I ate. Service was great too!",

I didn't get his name but he's an old man and he will start playing for you and demand a tip. We witnessed him get upset with many people for not telling him they didn't have cash for a tip before he started playing but he definitely sneaks up on you and will start serenading without being asked.

Lots of great entrees.   I chose the spaghetti and meatballs.  They were amazing.  My wife chose the eggplant parmigiana and it was among the best she has had.  The atmosphere is super cool and very old school Vegas.  Lots of pictures on the wall.  The waiters actually have names like Luigi.   Then as you are enjoying this amazing food, you are surprised to see an old Italian man that is like 90 years old come by your table with an accordian and play you song requests. Then as this is not enough to amaze you, they bring you an awesome cappuccino to finish off you experience.  My new favorite restaurant.",

The good parts of Battistas are good and the bad parts are expected.  First off the decor is totally dated -- and this is a plus!  When  you walk through the door you are transported to New Jersey circa 1978.   Secondly, this has to be the best order and dine system in Vegas. All entrees come with either soup or salad, side pasta and an after dinner sweetened cappuccino. In addition carafes of house wine are yours to drink for no additional charge.  This also makes reading the bill easier. Another win for Battistas.  Third up is the food. This one is not so good. My party tried spaghetti with meat sauce, lasagna and a steak dish.  All were edible but ho-hum. I really thought that they would be special due to the longevity of the operation. Oh well.  Overall I *would* eat here again but I wouldn't recommend it.

The food was awesome, I had the shrimp scampi with garlic butter on fettuccine - probably the best meal on the table. The portions are huge, and you get bread, salad, dessert cappuccino, plus unlimited wine!    Highly recommended for going out for a fun time.  Probably not great for an intimate date.",

The decor and atmosphere is what makes it OK for them to charge $20+ per plate.  The menu is simple and your table wine, soup or salad, entree and after dinner coffee is included.    Like I mentioned above, the atmosphere is very old school Italian and has a great atmosphere.  The service was really good and the food was decent.  If you're expecting a high end meal here you're in the wrong place.  The food is \"OK\" to \"decent\" but to call it \"really good\" is stretching it.    Would I come back?  I think so!",

This place is essentially the palace of hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Such a wonderful eclectic mix of stuff as I have never seen outside of Midwestern Cracker Barrel-esque restaurants. It practically carries you off to another place! But let's talk food for a minute. The garlic bread. Best I've ever had, hands down, anywhere. The antipasto salad? Very delicious. Red or white wine with your meal? The wine is okay, but the presentation gives you that authentic experience which goes above and beyond flavor. And the pasta itself? A classic testament to Italian cuisine, with perfectly complimentary flavors. The cappuccino at the end of our meal was the perfect touch, though I wish it had come with a cannoli. My only critique? Don't eat here if you are cutting back on sodium. Holy meatballs batman, I loved the flavor, but was it ever salty. Make no mistake though, we'll be back!",

Follow the sign and find your way into a charming and romantic side of old Vegas.   The food is decent. I've had better. I've had worse. The wine is what you would expect unlimited house wine to taste like. Having said that, for twenty something dollars, you can have garlic bread, salad (or Minestrone if you're not into the greens), a heaping bowl of pasta, and cappuccino that sort of tastes like maple syrup infused with chocolate (in an absolutely incredible way). Did I mention the unlimited wine part? You can drink loads and loads of wine here - it's light, and refreshing, and though it's not the best tasting, you get used to it. This place is about an incredible experience. It's about taking a breath of fresh air and enjoying a slow and luxurious dinner, filled with wine and a musician who will come to your table and play you a song (he did a rendition of California - like the older song, not the one from the O.C.). It's not just a dinner - it's an experience - one you'll come away loving. And as a bonus, you may not need to pay for food for another 24 hours because you will be stuffed!  Bonus - two separate people told us we were a cute couple. That's right, people went out of there way to be very nice for absolutely no reason other than to be nice. People are warm, the place is warm, with a decorated ceiling that makes you feel like you're in a real Italian home.",

I love their Seafood pasta, Eggplant Parmigiana, and their Linguine with Clam.  Mr Man recently tried their Special of the Day - a huge 16oz steak with mashed potatoes.  All the guys' jaws dropped when that big ol' hunk of meat came out.  All the guys tried it and instantly regretted not ordering the steak. hahahah Regardless, we all loved the food and had such good service from our waiter.  1 star taken due to being a bit pricey.  But hey, it's only 1 block away from the strip so you can't expect it to be cheap!",

The food is rather simple more than bad, kind of like the food you would have cooked in junior high school. But, the restaurant is very cute, and it is nice to get out of the casinos for a bit. Although simple, I thought the food was better than the food served at the casinos, which was often time just plain bad. And while the wine is not of the highest quality, it is drinkable.",

You can tell the just buy it from Walmart.  Then when the cappuccino came out it just tasted like hot chocolate what a joke.  Everyone else I was with was embarrassed too.  It would be nice if the service was good but they were all angry and didnt want to help us at all.  When I went to the bathroom our server was sitting at the bar talking.

But it does have a pretty low key, hole in the wall atmosphere so if you are looking for something like that you would probably enjoy it here. The food is pretty pricey for sub standard Italian fare. Service was good though.",

    "text": "This place is worth a visit for two reasons: the atmosphere is very old-school Chicago Italian, and it is within walking distance from the Westin. The 30 minute wait on a weeknight was not surprising. The little accordion dude was entertaining, but would have been much better off focusing on the large, jovial, lubricated groups of people and not on my colleague and I who were trying to have a work-related conversation. Can't blame him for trying though. Our server was rather non-attentive, and we had to actually request him to come over and take our orders which was strange. The food: I had veal parm (you almost feel obligated to order an old-school dish like this in this type of atmosphere). The veal was ok--but the sauce tasted a little on the undercooked and bland side. The salad was nothing special, but the free wine was nice. All in all--worth the experience and the large portions--but nothing I would go out of my way for again.",

    "text": "Rude accordion player ruined experience.  The food was good.  Meat lasagna was a large portion, good table wines, nice cappucino (though a bit sweet for me).  Our waiters were excellent.  The accordion player, was EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE.  You should be ashamed to have someone like that interacting with the public.  My colleagues and I were visiting from out of town and discussing some medical technologies when the accordion player forced himself onto our table, disrupted our conversation, berated us for using our phones to perform our jobs (we are medical IT), and then yelled at us when we didn't tip him for a 15 second melody when we didn't want him to impose himself upon us in the first place.  We didn't ASK you to join or conversation nor did we desire you to corner us at our table and shove your accordion in our faces.  He was disruptive and loud to the point that neighboring tables asked what his problem was.    He is no different than the street window washers that try to hold you hostage after washing your windows when you didn't ask for it.  The situation could have been avoided if he had some social awareness or led with, \"May I interest you in a tune?\"  The food was good, but not so good as to be worth the wildly disrespectful service we encountered.  We will never go back, we are advising our colleagues to avoid this place, and I advise the public to avoid this place.",

    "text": "Celebrated my friends birthday on Saturday.  Battista's is a favorite of hers and rightfully so.   We had reservations and they were ready for us and seated us as soon as our party was there.  All I can say is the wine was flowin (free btw-coplimentary with your dinner) the bread kept comin and service was great!  The bread is drenched in butter...not good for the cholesterol but pretty darn good.  My bf and I ordered ziti with meatballs and pink sauce.  Pink sauce isn't on the menu but they said they would do it for us.  It was pretty average.  I've definitely had better.  We also ordered sausage and peppers and the bf loved that.  From the looks of everyone elses orders it was a wide variety of selections and I didnt hear any complaints and there were alot of clean plates.  I've been here several times and we definitely don't come for the food...it is pretty average...mainly for the the ambiance and the one of a kind experience.  Gordie, the accordion player, is such a pleasant addition to the experience as he gifts us with his music and witty songs.  It is a good place to celebrate special days with a group or even for date night.  The place is a Las Vegas staple amongst the locals and vacationers. It is all about the simple things:  Gordie, the decor/ambiance, the menu on the wall, the complimentary wine, even the door to the restaurant that looks kinda like a barrel when you come through the front door.  Sometime simple is best. ;)",

    "text": "How disappointing this place turned out to be.  We arrived a bit early for our reservation, so we went to the bar to grab a drink.  The drink was nice and strong, but I suspect they do that so you don't complain about anything else.  I ordered a cake to be delivered, which it did.  I had to ask the host if it had arrived, even though days earlier, they said they would make a note of it in our reservation.  The wait staff barely said 5 words to us.  Seemed like they were being forced to work under sweat shop conditions or had no grasp of the English language.  No idea, they never communicated to us.  The accordion player was a 90 year old man who did the same \"act\" to everyone.  I felt bad for him.  Being as that I had ordered a cake for a birthday, you would have expected him to sing happy birthday.  So sad. So much potential, but it fell flat on its face.   The garlic bread was soggy and old.  The salad was drenched in so much vinegar and oil.  The lasagne and other dish we ordered was very bland and lacked flavor.  You could tell they just made a bunch of food ahead of time and just reheated it.  I had to track down someone to find out when the cake was going to come, since we had finished our dinner.  It finally came, after we were about to leave.  As the wait staff, who still has not spoken more than a few words to us, cleared our table, the waiter dumped a full glass of water into my crotch.  He handed me towels.  No apology whatsoever.    I thought this would be a fun, quirky place to celebrate a birthday.  BIG MISTAKE!  Oh, they let you take your wine from your table in Styrofoam glasses...classy...  This truly is a HOLE IN THE WALL...    So much potential... it failed.. failed big time.  I walked out of there full, but not satisfied.  Oh, and with a wet crotch.    This is not a fake post... it had better not be removed by management... they should take note, and fix the issues.",

It was plenty of food half of which I needed up taking home. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce had good flavor.  The cappuccino at the end reminded me a little of the over sweet gas station cappuccino I used to stop and get in high school and college. The wait staff was very nice. The atmosphere of the place is pretty cool too, very old school family Italian restaurant style.  It is not a place to go if you want to be blown away by homemade fresh Italian pasta but it's a fun spot to share a meal with friends and the price for what you get is really good as well.",

I made reservations nearly a month ago so I would make sure we could have dinner here. My mother, sisters and I were in Las Vegas to honor our Father, our mother's husband of 62 years, on the one year anniversary of his passing (9/11/2018). Being an awesome Italian man, Daddy loved this restaurant, he and my mom dined here every time they went to Vegas, so we thought, that with over 2300 restaurants in Las Vegas, there was no better place to go to celebrate his amazing life and allow us to remember him. I noted in my reservation why we chose this place and why it was so important for us to go here.  We are heartbroken over our experience. We felt rushed (5 of us were in and out in a little over an hour), (my sister made a joke that it was like speed eating), we were treated like we were an imposition to our server, and like no one cared that we were even there. When we told our server about our Daddy's passing and why we were there, she said \"Sorry\" and walked away. I didn't expect much, but I did expect to be treated with compassion. We are crushed, we will never be back. You are not like home style Italian...at least not like the Italian Family we are from. We will never get another chance to have dinner as a family on the one year anniversary of my Daddy's passing. Your team took that away from us. Our experience made a very sad day, that much more sad.   Signed, Heartbroken Orlando Family.",

I went to Battista's because it was recommended from the hotel that we were staying at and that it had a long history on the Vegas area. So I figured let's give it a shot, how bad can it be. Very disappointed to say the least.",

    "text": "Let's just put it out there:  Battista's is food for the masses.  It's like a cafeteria disguised as a restaurant and it's serving mass-produced, perfectly edible fare.  The food is fine (but crazy overpriced).  Our service was excellent.  The accordion guy is amusing.  The decor is kitschy and colorful.  The gals at the hostess stand were standoffish and definitely need personality transplants.  Look, I love great service and the service was really friendly and attentive.  So, they get points for that.  The food was perfectly edible.  It's not great and it's not bad.  But with a million great restaurants in LV, I'm not sure you need to be eating average food anywhere.  The lasagna was about as good as you can buy in the frozen food section of your local supermarket.  It was fine but nothing special.  The chicken parmigiana was a much, much better dish and, if you must eat here, I would go for that plate.  You get two pitchers of wine (white and red) on your table and you pour it yourself and drink as much as you want.  It's all included with the overpriced food.  It's drinkable stuff but nothing special.  You do realize there are bottles of wine out there for sale that are $2 and $3 a bottle right?  This is probably that stuff.  So, don't get too excited about the \"free\" wine.  You also get a \"homemade\" cappuccino included with your meal.  It's an absolute sugar bomb and unlike any other cappuccino I've ever had.  For me, this WAS the dessert (and honestly, even though the sugar levels were off the charts, it was pretty darn good).  Not a bad experience at all but really, no strong reason to return.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the salad...mixed greens with no ice berg lettuce in sight! A warning for vegetarians, ask for no salami! I had the eggplant parmigiana. Wonderful and filling.

I ordered chicken parm which the chicken was a huge portion and you get a little side of pasta which I didn't mind because I'm not a pasta fan. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Marsala which isn't on the menu but they made it for him and he ate the whole thing. I ate most of mine but couldn't take it back to the hotel because we don't have a fridge or microwave. The service was great only issue we had was waiting for more bread but it was busy so I'm not going to complain.   The only issue I had was the stupid old ladies behind us who honestly complained the whole time for no reason !!!! They were so rude about it I almost got up to tell them to shut up. They even said something to a couple that just sat down about how they couldn't get a wine glass for the free wine, they give you a little shot glass to drink from but that's fine ! Not something to complain about. They were being so long about how they were never coming back which is fine but keep it down and to yourself!!! We had a great experience thank you !",

    "text": "It was a VERY slow Tuesday night at the restaurant. I made a reservation for 6:30 p.m.. The hostess who took the reservation was apathetic at best. She didn't repeat back the information on the telephone to ensure that the time and name were correct, she just said, \"Yup.\"  Upon arrival to the restaurant the hostess who showed us to her seat just motioned for us to go to our seat  and did not specify which seat. She should have just walked us to  a row, containing six different tables to show which table specifically, but instead she rudely pointed and had us guess which table she referenced. Seriously? !    We waited 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us, and when I asked whether or not a worker who walked by was our server, he simply replied, \"NOPE! \" in the most apathetic fashion possible.  At this point in time, my better half went to speak to the manager regarding the atrocious service we'd received thusly. The manager simply stated, \"Well, I've never had any complaints about him before, all I don't know what to tell you.\"   I continued to wait for water/acknowledgement from our server who had already walked by me 3 times without so much as a \"hello, I'll be right with you.\"   At that time I requested to speak with the manager \"Doug\" myself. I explained the situation that no one at the restaurant seemed to have any interest in providing any level of satisfactory service, and he simply shrugged it off and said, \"Well, I hope it gets better.\" Instead of taking ownership of the problem and asking how he could MAKE things better, he apathetically walked away and did nothing.  At this point in time we had lost our appetites and our desire to dine at a restaurant who simply didn't care about the quality of service they provide. This is level of laziness is  usually reflected in the food as well.  \"Doug\" watched us walk out without any concern for losing our business, and I guarantee that I will NOT be back. As a professionally trained chef, I do not go out for the great food as much as the service, as I can create any dish I desire in my own gourmet kitchen.  This place is completely unacceptable any longer. This was my 6th and final visit to this restaurant. I used to recommend this place time and again to all of my friends who visit this fine city. I am flabbergasted that a city built on hospitality could have an entire restaurant full of staff who just simply doesn't care about their customers. Obviously they learned it from their manager Doug. These things always start at the top.   NEVER AGAIN",

The bad:  We had the linguini chopped clams, sausage cacciatore and meat lasagna   Linguini chopped clams: Bland bland bland. You can barely taste the clam and it's also very soggy. The serving bowl was also unappealing. It was placed on a stainless steel bowl  Sausage cacciatore: The sauce itself was ok. A little on the bland side. The sausage was a different story. It has a weird taste. It tasted like they tossed a whole bunch or herbs and hoped for the best.   Meat lasagna: Pretty average. Nothing special. Taste like lasagna from other Italian restaurant  The \"free\" wine is a NO for me.  It taste like red wine as if it was bought from the dollar store.  Cappuccino was ok I guess. A little on the sweet side.  The price didnt reflect the quality of the food.  $30 + for overpriced cafeteria tasting Italian food.  I suggest going to bucca di beppo instead. Where the price justifies the quality of the food.",

    "text": "Battista's may not be considered \"fine dining,\" but it earns a 5-star rating from me! I love bringing visitors here, and here's why:    * Ambiance: This is old-school Vegas. There aren't many places like this anymore, with big red booths, dark secluded rooms, and celebrity photos on the walls.    * Service: From the hostess to our waitress and busser, everyone was friendly and professional. Too bad we missed the accordion player on the night we visited.   * Price: Meals range from $23 to $41 per person. A steal, when you consider they offer tons of food and all-you-can-drink wine!  And, most of all ...   * Food: Great cheesy garlic bread. Great salad (more like an antipasto than a traditional house salad). A tasty cappuccino after dinner. And Italian classics like chicken parm ($31) and veal marsala ($34), plus faves like spaghetti and meatballs, linguine and clams, lasagna, and ravioli. Although the underseasoned entrees are the weak links in the lineup, they are still pretty tasty. And did I mention ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK WINE?! And they aren't stingy with it, either. Ask for red, white, or both, and they will bring you a carafe or two--or more. (Just don't be a lush and spoil it for the rest of us!)  This may be just a \"hole in the wall,\" but as the landscape around it changes, I wholly hope Battista's is here to stay!",

Old school, dark and reminiscent of the \"good ol days\" of Vegas, Battista's was a perfect place to unwind after a day of gambling and shopping. Very reasonably priced, all dinners included a full carafe of wine, both white and red, and a after dinner cappuccino. The lasagna was delicious and was a generous size. We are in Vegas several times a year and will definitely be back here.",

I had heard about this place for a while now as couple friends had their first dates here.  AND it's one of those vintage hole in the wall joints. I am super down with that!   Came here on a random night before hitting up The Linq next door.  There was a 30 minute wait so we just had a couple drinks at the bar.   Prior to coming here, I mentioned to the BF that it was all you can drink wine and he's all \"nah, maybe a glass!\"  Welp, as soon as we sat at our table, we were greeted with a cradle of white AND red wine. YES, TWO ALL YOU CAN DRINK WINES!!!! Our waitress didn't want us to make a choice on which wine to drink. **boom**   Our salad was bomb. The pasta we ordered was \"eh.\" I wasn't blown away by the pasta nor did it make an impression. The cappuccino was EXTRA bomb tho!   Ambiance was exactly what I pictured. Dimly lit, old school resto. Vintage photos and quotes on the wall. This would be great for first dates :)  I'll def be back again. For the wine and cappuccino! And good company, of course :)!",

    "text": "Unlimited wine? I'm in 100%. I'm aggrieved that I wasn't informed about this enticing deal sooner. Located off Flamingo and the Linq, Battista's Hole in the Wall has all the character of an old school Italian restaurant. The entryway makes you feel like you're in a giant wine barrel, and the area by the host stand is a feast for the eyes. From floor to ceiling, Battista's is lined with interesting tid bits and knick-knacks (like an extensive collection of mini liquor bottles!). Lighting is dim and like any good Italian joint, patrons are greeted with the sound of raucous laughter and conversation. Reservations are a must - we arrived on a Tuesday evening with reservations at 8PM. We were lucky to find parking in the crowded lot. Amid the hustle and bustle, we ended up being seated at 8:15PM.   CHEESE MANICOTTI ($25.95): Like all meals on the menu, this entree comes with a salad or minestrone soup, garlic bread, unlimited house red and white wine, and a cappuccino at meal's end. I opted for the salad as my starter, which was heavily dressed in Italian and had sparse toppings (1 olive, 1 slice of mozzarella, 1 sweet pepper, etc.). Though lacking creativity, the salad was fine. The accompanying garlic bread was warm, fresh, and delicious. The manicotti was served with a side of creamed spinach, which helped to break up the overwhelming amount of cheese on the manicotti. Instead of being served in wine glasses, guests are provided with small shot-like glasses to use for the wine. Kind of odd, but after a few glasses I cared not. The cappuccino was a sweet treat that I enjoyed every second of. 4/5  CHICKEN RIO ($29.95): \"Superb\" according to my husband. He said the sauce was quite similar to jagerschnitzel sauce. Served with a side of shredded zucchini. He'd order the same thing again! He didn't leave a speck of food left on the plate and was so full he couldn't drink any more wine. 5/5  SERVICE: Food came out quickly and in order. The waitress was a bit over flirtatious but she took care of us overall.       Worth a Return Visit? On the whole, I rather enjoyed my meal. I wouldn't order the manicotti again, but will definitely come back to order another menu item at Battista's. For an Italian meal with Vegas panache, you can't beat the deal Battista's offers. Dinner for two cost $60 pre-tip, a bargain for Strip prices.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #13",

We were seated within 5 minutes of our reservation time and were greeted by a very friendly and competent server. The free wine wasn't at the 100 pt. level, but, was definitely decent and together, most of us enjoyed more than one carafe. Garlic bread was great and pastas were better than average. One of our party ordered a steak which was undercooked, but, was reluctant to send it back. I asked gently if there was something she could do and she immediately apologized and grabbed the dish to cook further. It came back quickly and was turned out to be very good. Cappacino was ok, but, overall service, atmosphere and food was great, especially for the amount we spent. I would visit over again and recommend to everyone.",

And the dinner portions are huge.  I always get the manicotti and it is big enough for two meals.  However, be prepared to wait, most times 30 minutes or more.  The ambiance is outdated and could use a face lift.  And it is VERY LOUD.  And I've never had great service.  A couple of the waiters are very curt and a little rude.  But the food is good and worth going for and worth the wait.",

The food is basic Italian, but in a good way, nothing fancy but full of flavor.  Faves from the table were the sausage cacciatore and shrimp with a tasty alfredo sauce.  But the real draw is the all you can drink house wine (both red and white) that they provide for the table.  There's a little man that goes around playing the accordion and the environment is lively and friendly.  The wait staff was fabulous as well.",

But for some this can be a trip to one of Dante's levels; to start, by sitting at the table you become part of a factory-style service with explanations coming at you like an auctioneer, the food is served with efficient repetition and the quality is on par with chain Italian restaurants. That is you can understand and taste the concept of the dish made long ago, but the shortcuts have eviscerated the essence. If you are lactose intolerant--sucks for you. The included wine, garlic bread and cappuccino while nice for some make it too expensive to buy a nice bottle of wine or other sides. Love the pics of the famous on the wall.",

Paid $23 for cheese tortellini with \"meat sauce\".  With that you get a salad, garlic bread, and their house wine (red wine vinegar, perhaps?).  My pasta had clearly been sitting in a vat too long, and there was no meat to be found in the sauce.  I could have done better with a bag of frozen pasta and a jar of Ragu, and I hate Ragu.  Seriously, I don't know why anyone who reads these reviews would come here.  Dining in Vegas can be pricey and it can be bad, but at Battista's you get both in one visit.",

    "text": "Went there on a recommendation.  Was told it was the best chicken parm ever. Booked reservations through Open Table although Sunday night at 7:00 was not very crowded. We were able to walk there from the Flamingo. One block up past the pool.  At first glance you would probably just drive by as it doesn't look appealing. Inside the place is very old school lots of celeb pics on the wall.   When we were seated at our table 2 carafes of wine were included (1 red, 1 white) all you can drink house. The menu seems a little pricey $28 for chick parm but with wine,salad,garlic bread and a cappuccino following your meal its not that bad.  The salad was dressed with a House Italian dressing which was tasty and also came with a few pieces of salami and a nice hunk of cheese. Garlic Bread was very good.  Plenty of garlic and butter and seemed to be very fresh. The Chicken parm was tender and juicy and thick.  Now the sauce - It was a little sweet and bland which is why only 4 stars.  We had them bring a little garlic powder to the table to give it a little more flavor.  The cappuccino was a nice touch for after the meal. Topped high with whipped cream.  We would go back again although I would probably order the Alfredo sauce.",

And followed by the Chicken Dance song. 2) The wine flows, and doesn't suck.  In fact, I liked it!  The red anyway, didn't try the white. 3) The several course meal in the dark rooms, walls covered with photos of icons of the past who used to hang out here... it's great for chillin' with your friends, drinking, relaxing and stepping back from the standard Las Vegas vibe. 4) Elvis used to come here.",

FYI - they have a full bar, but nothing on tap.  So, the food. Great salad and a yummy hot chocolate they call cappuccino.  The garlic bread and wine that also come with the meal were mediocre. The food was...just ok. I guess when I pay $30 for a bowl of spaghetti I am expecting to get wowed!  Not the case here - and the portion is not a family style portion which would have helped explain the cost.

Flavors have a lot of garlic, which I like, but is not to everyone's taste. Everything tastes good and was cooked well. I think it's better than an Olive Garden and actually has better quality.  Ambiance dark and cozy with a ton of random stuff on the walls. Definitely book reservations if you can. There is not a lot of room to stretch out and the tables are tightly packed in.

He was definitely right. It was on the dot 5pm and there was a crowd. Menu is simple, prices are fair and the food is so good (especially after food court food from the casinos!). We will definitely be back here on our next trip to Las Vegas. (For dessert I highly suggest the Spumoni ice cream cake!)",

The clams and linguini is fabulous and generous. The menu is simple and on the wall. There is a little guy who plays an accordion who has been there for decades, you must have him playa a song for you. This place is a guaranteed stop every time my wife and I visit. This is also a celebrity frequented establishment. Very consistent service!",

    "text": "This place is old-world from everything to it's food, service, entertainment and decor. It's like a mom and pop restaurant with old world cooking and casual dining. And it has a unique menu that has a lot of sides that come with your entree. Every table gets a carafe of red or white wine, I'm told it's unlimited. Then you get a choice of minestrone soup or salad. Each order comes with garlic bread, your choice of a side and cappuccino! That's a lot of stuff!!   I don't remember the prices since I came here over a year ago maybe 2, but even if they were high you get so many other items with your meal. The wine isn't the greatest but it comes bundled with your meal so why not.   They do have an old old man that goes around playing the accordion, it's actually very sweet and comedic at the same time. But I prefer people not to go around soliciting for money and entertainment while I eat.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan and I believe it was a huge piece of meat. The pasta was just okay, slathered on sauce onto spaghetti noodles. The garlic bread was more just buttered french loaf. Not really a fan of the food. But the cappuccino was yummy and a nice ending to the meal.   This place is definitely a dive but it's kitschy and nice that they try so hard.",

    "text": "I should have read the yelp reviews first...  I'm surprised at the people who believe this is an authentic Italian restaurant.  I admit, I was pulled in by the sign...I was given the impression that this was an old school italian joint so I thought maybe the food had a chance.  I'd rather go to Olive Garden and that's pretty sad.  Beware of any restaurant that has a bunch of bullshit on their walls and some dancing monkey doing tricks.  It's usually a sure sign that they're trying to distract you from their mediocre food.  This is pretty much standard SYSCO food supply.  I ordered the cioppino, my girlfriend got the veal parm.  The cioppino was acceptable, but still a bit bland.  Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.  My girlfriend's veal was very bad.  Had a strange aftertaste that for me, made it fairly inedible.  Everyone mentions the garlic bread.  Sure, it's good, but it's garlic bread.  If you go to an Italian restaurant and your lasting impression was the garlic bread, the restaurant has failed.  I didn't need the accordion guy.  Again with the gimmicks.  I know people think that guy is cute and funny, etc, but personally, I found him very uncomfortable.  He bets on that uncomfortable to you pass him some money so he'll go away.  I felt kind of bad for him.  In a town where selling your soul for the hustle is standard practice, I didn't need it in my face while I'm trying to have a good meal.  I've been eying this place for a while, so I'm glad I got it out of the way but with all the great restaurants in this city, I felt like I wasted an opportunity.",

(Disclaimer: Since they do offer unlimited wine here, please keep this in mind as you read this review.  Due to certain reasons, I may have somewhat of a selective memory.)  I've gone here with big groups on trips to Vegas before we go out.  Always make reservations if you have large groups!  The place is huge, but usually pretty crowded.    They have their food menus written on the walls, and they have these meal combinations that include an entree, salad or soup, bread, a hot chocolate type drink, and of course... as much red and white wine as you want!  I believe they range $20-30.  But again I repeat... unlimited wine.  I usually go with the eggplant parmesan, which is delicious.  Cheesy goodness.  Probably a 3.5 star, but gets the job done for a dinner before a night of dancing and drinking.  Other things that friends have ordered just looked okay.  So I know I keep talking about the wine, but what really stands out to me about this place.... is the first time I went here, they gave us two giant to-go cups of wine!  I'm talking Big Gulp size!  That's the Vegas spirit!",

Now it is a assembly line, I have eaten at Battista's for the last time, the eggplant was tough, cold and not cooked properly and the soup was cold, the last three times I have had dinner their the soup was cold. The music is the same with the accordion player, I remember his first day.  Unfortunately my wife and myself will pass on this restaurant the next time we come to town.",

    "text": "We've been to Battista's before but it's been a while.  As last night was our friends birthday and she wanted to go there, we figured it would be great to go back. \"Aye Carumba\", what the heck happened to this place. The place was jam packed with people and took forever to be seated because, unless your whole party is present, they won't seat you even with a reservation.  Once we got seated, it was a quick explanation of the menu and if we needed any time to order.  We ordered our food and \"Wham-O\", our food was there immediately.  We had Chicken Cacciatore and Veal Parmigiana as our main course.  The chicken was dry and the veal was thin & fatty.  The sauces were thin and seemed watered down.  At the end of our meals, the server, who had the personality of a wet mop, immediately threw down the check without asking if we needed anything else or if we wanted dessert.  It would have been a shame because the Cannoli, which wasn't the best, was the best part of this meal.  We also ordered a side of sausage, which were thin sliced pieces covered in a pasty tomato sauce for $8.50!   Parking sucked!! It was a nightmare to get there, the parking lot is small and they park limos right in front of the entry making it impossible to get by.  We had to park at a nearby hotel and walk to the restaurant. I don't know if the original owners are involved or even care about the place anymore but it SUCKED!!  Obviously, they are only catering to tourists and their past history.  I can't see how locals would keep going there with so many other good Italian restaurants in town. Unfortunately, we will never be back there again.  I'd rather remember the past good times there than the feeling like I just ate at a Furr's Cafeteria!",

    "text": "Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.  It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.  Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.",

I've been here a couple of times and the food is consistently bland and pricey. Bottom line, come if you're looking to grab a couple of drinks (unlimited house white or red wine comes with your meal, along with a generic flavored cappuccino after dinner) and you have really low expectations for cuisine.",

My fiance saw Bautista's and I told her that I had eaten there before. and it was amazing. Well they did not disappoint.  I believe Kerry was the head server there and the staff was absolutely spectacular!  I couldn't believe how  together they kept everything in spite of the fact that the restaurant was completely packed beyond belief.    Kudos to Bautista's and their professionalism, quality food and environment! Thank you for the wonderful wedding dinner!  Highly recommend Battista's for big parties.  A side note:  The man who played the Italian wedding song on accordion for us at our table, made our experience so lovely.",

    "text": "With the infinite nightlife and snazzy restaurants that line the Strip of Las Vegas, Battista's Hole In the Wall may be overlooked at first glance. However, this gem provides a unique, fun atmosphere with a flavor of Italia.  The menu is posted on the walls in large font and contains simple dishes that remain unchanged. Each meal comes with soup or salad, garlic bread, and free wine that is sure to loosen up the group. The meals are fairly priced and the portions will leave you with a satisfied stomach. Every meal also comes with a free cappuccino. From my travels in Italy, their cappuccinos taste more like hot chocolate. But then again, how can you complain when it is included for free?  Along with the generous portions, Battista's charismatic atmosphere really shines through when the accordion player graces you with his charming presence. The experience of Battista's makes any occasion feel special, from date night, to family night, to a night out on the town!",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by a friend who comes to Vegas frequently, and I was not disappointed. It looks a little shady at first, right next door to a liquor store in a strip mall. But the staff were all very nice, and we were seated right away (at 7 pm on Friday night).   You can't beat the value- there are tiers to the menu, depending on your entree. I got the ziti with pomodoro sauce, which was the lowest tier at $21.95. The pricier options include steak and veal and can go as high as $38.95. Whatever entree you choose, it comes with house wine, garlic bread, soup or salad, and cappuccino.  The garlic bread was delicious and plentiful (we went through two baskets...there were two of us). The salad was great, surprisingly large and had great leafy greens, not just a bag of iceberg dumped into a bowl. My pomodoro sauce wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either. The cappuccino WAS amazing. So, so good. My mom who doesn't ever drink coffee/espresso tried a sip and we ended up splitting it.  The real attraction is the ambience and the adorable accordion player, Gordy. He found out we were from Missouri and played the Missouri waltz for us! Very sweet and he gives the place a lot of character.  The food is nothing earth-shattering but it's all tasty and you get SO much for the money. Definitely check it out, if only to be serenaded by Gordy.",

    "text": "I would go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Everyone should try HITW at least once if you are in Vegas. A bit expensive for what you get, but that's the modern Vegas strategy.  Salad - spring mix salad in a bag, like you get at the grocery, with a little added mozzarella cheese, 1 olive, and 1 tomato, with Italian dressing. It was okay.  Wine - I'm not sure you can call the house wine real wine, more of a win-like-fluid. The best I can say is that it's drinkable, and forgettable. It tastes like it's been watered down but I don't know if that's the case or not.  Garlic bread - The accompanying garlic bread was like that you would get in your grocer's freezer section. Meh.  Entree - We had the mussels in red sauce and enjoyed it. The pasta was perfectly al dente. The tomato sauce is a little spicy and I liked that. It tasted somewhat fresh with whole basil leaves. The mussels were a tad over cooked, but not so much that I didn't enjoy them.   Cappuccino - I don't know what was in my plastic mug, but it sure as hell wasn't cappuccino. Took one sip and it was awful. Very sugary sweet and tasted of chocolate. I'm guessing this is some powder mix in a mug. Yuk.  Service - our waiter existed, but we hardly ever saw him. I would actually say it was poor service. He hardly even spoke and wouldn't even look you in the face. We waited over 20 minutes for him to pick up our payment I gave up and went to the host desk.  Atmosphere - this was the fun part; there is so much to see and read on the walls and ceiling you could be there for years. One small downside was that our tablecloth was freshly stained with the wine-like-fluid.  I would come back again, but set my expectations a little lower. If you come here once, that's probably enough.",

(Nearly a month later and we're still talking about the garlic bread.) We wanted for absolutely nothing. Anytime anyone needed something, bam! It was already on the table.  It's not a fancy spot, and it isn't going to cost you enough to impress a shallow date, but you'll be treated and fed really well.  Battista's should not be passed up. Ever.",

    "text": "Where do I begin with this review.  First off, I would like to state that the reviews that talk about the portions being small are not True, the wine tasting like grape juice or that it is has been watered down not True and that the food does not taste authentic this is also not True.  When you step into this building you immediately travel to Old Vegas, yes the price is not cheap but it's not over the top either for the overall experience.  Please keep in mind when you dine here, you are truly having an experience, it is such a treat.  You can be serenaded by an older gentleman with an accordion, he played a Disney tune for my children.  Food: Now the food.  We did not have the wine but have on previous visits, it is just your typical cheap wine not bad for all you can drink red and white built into the price.  We had the spaghetti and meatballs, the lasagna, Hubby had the chicken picante and a rather large portion of ravioli off the kids menu.  Hands down the red sauce is authentic and very addicting!  The portions are large, we took food home.  Every meal comes with all you can drink wine or non alcoholic beverage, soup or salad, delicious garlic bread, the main entree and cappuccino to finish.  My kids absolutely love this place, it makes them feel fancy!  Service: Needs a little work, not that they aren't efficient but could definitely be more warm to what they are trying to accomplish.  The Manager was seen walking around helping seat, table touching and greeting guests, this is a plus in my book and very much appreciated.  Now the hostess needs to be addressed.  When I called to make reservations she was a bit rough as well as hard to understand.  Seeing her in person I now see why because she talks with the phone away from her face and is quite gruff, wouldn't hurt for her to smile and thank the patrons.  Really it just seems like she hates her job.  Overall, a must go to in Vegas.  We are locals and will keep going back.  For a Strip Property it is appropriately priced.  We had a Groupon this time around that saved us $30 made the experience even better!  Keep Yelpin Y'All!",

Free wine and a cappuccino with your order.   Update: Everything had been great as I mentioned in my review five months ago. However, this most recent time was a complete turn of events. Ever since I ate here for the first time, I've spoken highly of this place to dozens of people and have often times brought friends/family to dine with me. Last week, for my birthday, I came with a party of six. I ordered the spaghetti I usually order. To my surprise, they came ridiculously thin. Battista's noodles always had the thick noodles. My parents and I weren't satisfied with the customer service provided by our waitress. At one point, my mom asked a question about her lasagna and the waitress responded with \"that's just the way it is\" and very abruptly turned the corner without making eye contact to answer a simple question.   Have you ever spoken highly about a significant other just to have them do you dirty and break your heart? Well, I personally haven't BUT if you answered yes to that question, that is how embarrassed I felt when I constantly spoke highly about the restaurant just to be disappointed when I brought my family.   Ps: my girlfriend is reading over my shoulder and she said \"don't forgot to mention that my spaghetti was spicy which it never is\".",

I ordered a grilled chicken breasts because I'm not an Italian food fan, but it was also very good with steamed and grilled veggies under it. Then we were given \"cappuccinos\" after our meals, it was basically hot chocolate and it had no flavor or caffeine. The service was pretty slow and the entire hotel is extremely dark.

The waiters talk very firmly and fast because everything is pre-made (cheap) so that you can't ask for substitutions or changes.  The menu is pre-done and very small and you must stick to their script.  This isn't a real restaurant, it's expensive fast food in a restaurant setting.  Pre-made meal comes with choice of pre-made salad or minestrone but we were basically forced to get the salad via peer pressure from the waiter, and a very limited amount of garlic bread.  The house wine is cheap boxed wine that isn't even drinkable, but if you want to drink cheap wine and get an horrific headache the next day be my guest!  They serve the red wine cold if that tells you anything lol.  The website says they have other wine/champagne options but nothing was ever offered or asked of us since that isn't part of their fast talking choreographed routine apparently.  I asked and was reluctantly given their drink menu which is available only by asking, and told the waiter I wanted to order a glass of champagne but needed to look at the menu first.  We tried flagging him down the entire time just to order this 1 simple thing, but he never came and I was finished with my small plate of pasta and then didn't want the drink anymore, so never bothered ordering it.  My friends complained to someone else, but I was over it.  Didn't matter, he never came back.  We also asked for more garlic bread that never arrived.  He remembered to come bring us the check though (with gratuity already included) but never bothered doing his actual job.  They brought us out pre-made (cheap) 'cappuccino' after the meal and anyone who actually knows what cappuccino is would be grossly offended by this sweet cheap pre-made whatever it was with whipped cream on top.  It was so sweet it wasn't even drinkable.  This place is cheap cheap cheap and they charge a hefty amount for what you're actually getting.  They are lucky I was with a large group and the check was given to someone else, because I would have happily deducted the tip the waiter gave himself on our check.  This place is a cheap scam.",

Naturally I was very excited to eat some spectacular Italian cuisine in the city of sins. Our waiter was extremely rude and told us multiple times to wait when we asked him for help. That is absolutely unacceptable for the price of the food. On top of that, our soup came out cold and our garlic bread was soggy. For our main course we shared linguini and clams which was subpar. The wine sauce had an odd flavor and had what seemed like an endless amount of shell pieces in it. As well as that the noodles were over cooked and mushy. This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at an \"upscale\" restaurant. If you want overpriced mediocre Italian food, you're better off with Olive Garden.",

The food was amazing, the atmosphere took you away from the Las Vegas strip.  Prices were amazing for everything you got. Delicious garlic bread, choice of soup or salad (we opted for salad in the 90 degree weather), each table was given a caraff of white and red wine included with your meal, and the most delicious cappuccino for dessert!  Portions were slightly large so I suggest going there hungry because you want to eat everything!!  Would definitely go back again and we passed on the recommendation to everyone we met looking for a great meal at a great price!",

I was very excited to try this long standing icon that has stayed through the years!   I am sad to report that this report is not about the food, which was nothing more than average, but, in the way I was treated!   I brought my two adult sons who are here with me on vacation.  I am a gastric bypass patient who has successfully kept off 185 pounds. When I saw that their menu was all set pricing I politely explained to my boring waitress that I did not drink wine and that I only eat a few mouthfuls late at night, I was rudely told that it was 13.00 to share, no matter what! I literally ate three mouthfuls of the cold soup and one mouthful of my sons lasagna! Now I am far from cheap and was not going to cause a scene, but, Battista's you failed me! I send hundreds of guests to Las Vegas annually. You will not be on my recommendation list. I am disgusted to know your lack of compassion in a persons health battle!!",

    "text": "Visit here once just for the experience! Located directly behind the Linq hotel on Linq lane it is one of the oldest and most darling Italian restaurants on the strip!   When you walk in you step right back into time... If you like those kind of places you'll love this, if you prefer newer more modern places you probably won't dig it as much as I did!  The walls are filled with pictures of famous people dining at Battista's over the years. We enjoyed sitting by photos of a young Wayne Newton. The menu is so simple - they have different price points with 5 or 6 entree options in each category and a flat price that includes bread, house wine, soup or salad and cappuccinos.   The service here was the same you would get at a 5 star restaurant I feel. The waitor had helpers who brought out the food and a water boy that kept up with everyone's water and bread.   The house wine was okay nothing great but I did enjoy the red better... for unlimited house wine being included in your meal it's hard to complain about! Plus they were served in the tiny Italian wine glasses that they drink out of from the movies!  The bread was super good! Tons of garlic and just had a lot of flavor I felt like.   Our salads were really good they didn't use too much dressing on the salad which I feel like is the case at most places... nothing was dry and everything was fresh!   I got the lasagna this is one of the largest entree's on the menu, I highly recommend you split this if you do, one person would be charged only $13. Which it's worth it I promise! Tons of ooey gooey cheese but you could still taste the meat sauce within. Just authentic and delicious.  Husband got the spaghetti and meatballs again the serving was huge we both could have had left overs to take back easy. He enjoyed his and said it was flavorful. The meatballs were homemade and not frozen like most places.  My favorite part of the entire thing was probably the cappuccino after reading reviews I thought i'd take one sip and be done nope this was warm and something about the whipped cream it had a pumpkin spice almost taste about it that was to die for!!  This place is a great experience and it's heart warming in my opinion to know these type places still exist even! Tons of history and just pure charming!",

That's it. You get accordion music in person. You get cappuccinos after dinner. You do as Battista says.

    "text": "I was so disappointed with my experience here after seeing so many positive reviews and picking this place for a birthday dinner, I was expecting a great time, but unfortunately for me, Battista's fell short.  To start with, we were a large party and most were there on time for the reservation, but despite that, we were unable to be seated for a further half an hour. It was a little unclear as to whether the tables weren't ready or whether they needed every guest there, but safe to say we were hungry and eager to start ordering when we finally sat.  The restaurant itself is cute with memorabilia and photos on the walls, but very dimly lit and a little cramped. As I'd never been here before, I had no idea that the only menu's offered were the ones on the walls and that you didn't mix and match. Not only that, but we all waited a further 10mins at the table before any server came over to order drinks or explain how things worked!  So the concept is, you order an entree from one of the 3 set prices on the walls ($23/$27/$33) and you get unlimited house wine, soup/salad, pasta side, garlic bread and a cappuccino at the end.   UNLIMITED?! Hmmmm...That's all well and good, however you DON'T really get unlimited wine because you have to call them over and keep asking for refills, you DON'T really get much of the soup/salad, pasta or garlic bread because they never refill or ask if you want anymore, so you have to feel like you're bugging the server to ask for more, and then it's forgotten about until you ask a third time!  The entrees themselves are probably $10-$12 more than what you would pay in a normal restaurant setting to make up for the so-called unlimited sides and drinks, but when you consider how much you are given the chance to consume, it's not value for money in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, the server was friendly enough when he was at the table, but he seemed a little disorganised and out of his depth with a larger party and as such, we felt a little neglected.  For entree, I went for the meat cannelloni and my partner went for the chicken parmigiana, so I can only comment on those. The cannelloni was a let down as the meat was a mushy bland mess. Thankfully it came with cheese and sauce to add flavour. The parmigiana was nothing special and not worth the money unfortunately.  The one great thing was the cappuccino, which was so delicious and moreish. I happily took my partner's as he couldn't finish it.  At the end, we were told we couldn't split the check, despite other albeit slightly smaller parties near us were splitting theirs. This seemed a bit strange to me seeing as unlike other restaurants, there were only 3 set prices to have to ring up, but despite this inconvenience we got there in the end!  Is this place anything special? No. Is the food great? No. Is it value for money? I don't think so. But maybe see for yourself, meanwhile there are other great Italian restaurants in the valley.",

It's the type of place that used to define Vegas- before celebrity chef eateries took over.   The menu is short and easy to navigate. Your meal comes with either soup or salad, garlic bread and two large carafes of wine, one red and one white. These carafes will be refilled as long as you're up for the task.  I had the veal piccante (piccata) and it was excellent. Came with steamed squash on the side and the sauce was perfectly lemony and laden with capers. The portions were large- and most meals except the pasta dishes come with a full boat of penne with marinara. We didn't leave hungry.  This was my first time here- but it will be the spot I go to anytime I'm in Vegas.",

The rooms were decorated with items (many of them hanging from the ceiling) which reminded me of household items found on the set of the movie, \"The Godfather.\"  As soon as we entered, our senses were greeted by the aromas coming out of the kitchen.  It was heavenly. My wife ordered lasagna on this trip, but for all three of our visits, I ordered linguini with chopped clams and white sauce.  For our fourth visit I intend to order it again. It's delicious and I can't get it back home. The decor, the atmosphere, the attentive staff, and the outstanding food made my visit to Battista's a 5-star experience.",

The food, as anticipated, was super yummy. The service was impeccable. The environment is fun and kitchy. The only thing I can ask for is a better Moscato option in the bar. That's it. Everything else is exactly as it should be.",

This is a True full course meal from Wine on the table-appetizers, soup or salad, entree drinks and a warm rich cup of cappuccino to cap it off!  The Appetizer platter is awesome and they aren't joking when they say it will feed 8-10 people! Cheese sticks, ravioli, even great cooked Italian sausage that will melt in your mouth!   The fettuccine was great! Noodles were perfect and the sauce awesome!   The fella that ventures around playing the accordion for guest is a perfect touch! Great experience that will be on the list for next time back in Sun City!",

Then at the end they give you a cappuccino for desert. Also they give you a full thing of red and white wine with your meal ( very dry wine). A local spot. Suggest make reservations and it is off the strip, but in walking distance. My favorite was their Shrimp with garlic and butter sauce ( see picture)- very garlicy and GREAT.

Our meals consisted of an appetizing meat lasagna, steak cascara, and ribeye. The entrees included pasta, house red and white wine, and the best cappuccino ever ar the end.

    "text": "I grew up in Las Vegas and have heard about this place for many years. My brother is a huge fan. We had so much hope and expectations. There was an hour wait but it was Saturday so that's expected and we anticipated the food being great so we stuck it out. We were really really disappointed.  Pros: Old school style, big portions, very cool (but busy/tacky) decor, real mob family type motif which was cool. Menu was on the wall and very simple, which is convenient.  Cons: Food. We didn't have a single good dish. Mozz sticks were not hot, and the outside crust was \"homemade\" but tasted like stale cardboard. The salads were Hurricane Katrina flooded with dressing, I like dressing, but dang the lettuce was floating! The free wine was very watered down, but what do you expect for free? We had Lasagna, one of my favorite dishes at every Italian restaurant, and Ravioli. The sauce is absolutely gross; It tasted like canned tomato paste, and not even the good kind. The sauce was so bad, I only ate about 1/4 of the Lasagna and that was a struggle. The raviolis weren't bad if you scraped off all the tomato paste. A good sauce is like one of the main guarantees you can expect at a good Italian place. For the sauce to be THAT bad, it was just utterly shocking.  We will not be eating here again or giving them another chance. Unless they come out with some sort of press release saying they've completely overhauled their sauce recipe.",

    "text": "This is one of those real hole in the wall places where you see it and think I wonder if it is any good. Well we have gone here for years! Even when on vacation, not far off the strip just behind flamingo or right across the street from Bally's side of their casino just off flamingo.  I bet back in the day this place was the place to go, you will see  old pictures on the walls.   When seated you will see The menu is posted up on the wall and is pretty straightforward and  easy to understand. Now how neat is that? You get unlimited red or white wine. Plus a house salad or minestrone soup and garlic bread. When you choose your entree there are about 5 different price levels ranging from $22 to $40 ~  example spaghetti and meatballs to a steak.One thing nice if you don't order a pasta dish you get a side of penne with marinara sauce.  You also will get a cup of cappuccino. For the amount of food and drink involved and the quality, it's a pretty good deal for your money. Especially unlimited wine!  Funny story took a friend there and he loves Italian food. Well he also loves wine and loves good Italian bread. He kept drinking and eating tons of bread(The bread is so good!). By the time we were done eating he was so full could barely walk, I think the bread expanded with the wine making him even fuller! He went back to the room and had to lay down for hours!   Over all this place has been here for years that tells you something! If you like Italian food try this place out. Or if you want to see a piece of old classic Vegas which is disappearing go here  And as a added plus a elderly man walks around with the accordion and serenades the tables. He plays some things by request.  Its a nice added touch ~ if you see him make sure to tip.. Overall its a old favorite of ours ~ One of the first restaurants we ate at when we first came to Vegas! Check it out we highly recommend it!  And before going  make reservations just to guarantee to get a seat they get pretty busy sometimes.  I hope this restaurant is here for many more years!!",

I went there for dinner with my friend, his mom, and sister. We're seated almost immediately and greeted by what I think was the busboy?  One thing I thought was strange was that the waiter touched our table a total of maybe two or three times? The busboy or back up waiter consistently came over to check our table to see how we were doing.   When we sat down white and red wine was dropped off.. Bottomless wine? Why not? But it's obviously not the best stuff. I barely touched it. The menus are posted on the wall, and at first glance I thought the prices were a bit high.. Then when the good came the portions were MASSIVE. The food was just okay, nothing outstanding.   For the price you're getting a soup or salad an entree and a dessert drink and bottomless wine while you dine. I guess it's not so bad.",

Even though I'm not a big wine person, I still thought I got my moneys worth from the experience alone. For $25 you get all you can drink red and white wine, a salad, pasta, garlic bread, and a dessert  cappuccino (amazing by the way). Anywhere else on the strip you can spend that on a burger, and a glass of water.  I recommend the fettuccine Alfredo, their sauce is amazing and they even give a bowl of it on the side.

I am very picky when it comes to Italian and Mexican food as I am both and was raised on authentic Mexican and Italian food and also lived in Italy and Mexico but I always give new places a shot. So here it goes,   I was very disappointed in the food as well as the lay out of the seating, when they seat you you are basically sitting with the table next to you in like a small room, I didn't get to witness the little hi who goes around playing music but I doubt that would of change my opinion about the place, the food was ok, nothing impressive, I had a steak that I honestly felt like I could of cooked it in my back yard and thrown some sauce on it. You get complimentary house wine but trust me no one is going there for the wine, my girlfriend who loves wine had to have her wine with water after every drink she took ( never seen anyone do that before ) so yeah the wine, not good. The coffee at the end was ok but again no one is going there just for that, I also felt everything was over priced but it makes sense because they really are charging you for their \" complimentary \" wine and coffee, at the end of the night I was disappointed but was happy I tried it because it's one of those Las Vegas things you have to do, I wouldn't go back or recommend it but if you are one those people who just has to cross it off your things to do in Las Vegas list then go for it.",

    "text": "I recently had my destination wedding in Las Vegas at the end of May and had about 40 guests fly in from Chicago with my husband and me. Of course we wanted to do something nice as a thank you for everyone, so we decided food would be the best thank you. We also didn't want to go into debt by having dinner at some place on the Strip with 40 people because let's be honest, we could spend a small fortune on drinks alone. Enter Battista's!  On a previous trip to Vegas, I convinced my now husband and another friend to try out Battista's Hole in the Wall. I had heard about this place for years, but never made it there and finally wanted to try it. Yes, it looks a bit sketchy from the outside (I think one of our guests who could see the building from their room in Bally's said, \"it looks like a place where the prostitutes hang out\"), but it is truly a fine, upstanding business. Live a little people!  Anyway, since we had been to Battista's and really enjoyed the food previously AND you get all the wine INCLUDED with the meal, we decided to have our wedding dinner here. And I will always be happy we did.  There was already a large(er?) group that had reservations at 7pm on that Saturday, but since we were only going to have 40 people they were able to get us in at the same time. We were not all at one table, but in a room with other diners where we basically were sitting in an L-shaped table configuration. I thought it was fun to have other diners in there as well, and I hope they enjoyed some of our speeches/toasts.   Now, the important part - the food. We had one couple that is pretty much on the pulse of everything chic and cool tell us they were so happy that the dinner is at Battista's since it had been recommended several time to them. And for good reason - I thought the food was excellent. I had Eggplant Parm and wish we I could have taken the large portion I had leftover with me. Everyone I spoke to gushed about their food and especially the cappuccino. I don't drink coffee, so I opted out, but those who do said it was the best they ever had.   In addition to the dinners and all the extras that come with them, we asked the servers to bring out dessert plates with assortments of what they had. Sadly, there was no cannoli, but they had tiramisu and spumoni. As mentioned, I'm not a coffee girl so I didn't try to tiramisu, but the spumoni was excellent! And they knew how much to bring out so there was nothing left!  For those of you looking to have a large dinner at Battista's, I believe our total bill was about $1400 all in. That's not bad for 40 people who were somewhat sober when they came and left full and tipsy! We let everyone order whatever they wanted off the menu, so it wasn't like there was a condensed menu to keep the prices down. I highly recommend Battista's Hole in the wall for large and small groups!  PS - the accordion player visited us several times and was such a cute man! It's too bad our group didn't know more of the words to That's Amore!",

The garlic bread was probably our favorite part of the whole meal but that may have just been because we were starving. I went for the lasagna whilst hubby opted for the linguine chopped clam. Lasagna was rather tasteless and way too tomato-ey, whist the linguine was extremely salty and just too overpowering on the fish side. Cappuccino - delicious but basically a cup of sugar. Cannot complain about the service. However, I do feel let down after having looked forward to trying the place out following recommendations from friends.

Yes, for the Rigatoni with white clams (on menu as linguine, but I enjoy when the chopped bivalves get inside a tubular pasta, at home I use cavatelli). But yes, the dish is THAT good. Huge portion, well executed with both clams in the shell & chopped. Some pepper flakes & grated cheese = mangia! Also, I leave with a to go box with at least two snacks worth of leftovers.   The atmosphere is loud and lively and every inch the eye can see is covered in some tchotckes. Gordy the adorable accordion player is charming and is as much a fixture as the unlimited red and white carafes of wine and accompanying soup, salad, sides & cappuccino.   Others have enjoyed chicken, veal, steak and various menu options and the fun vibe you can't help but find infectious once you open the wine barrel door into this unassuming strip mall spot (no curb appeal) behind the Flamingo.   No, you're certainly not going for Chateau Margeaux or artisan plated food. Instead, go with a date or a fun group (make reservations because you will wait otherwise)  eat, drink and be merry in this Las Vegas institution.   For birthdays/anniversaries, they bring spumoni with a candle  Trust me on the white clam sauce! Cin don :)",

But the place needs a reset on focus on experience and less focus on how fast they can turn tables.  Unfortunate, but I won't be back. $30 a person for dinner is a small ask for experience.  Not asking for much, just some decency.",

    "text": "I went to this restaurant based on the yelp reviews here and was disappointed.  Possibly my expectations were too high.. but our experience was not a great as some of the reviews listed.  So overall good service and good food.. Decent old school Italian food. The only service exception was a bus person taking items off the table without asking us if we wanted to take them to go.. and gave us a cappuccino without asking if we wanted it.. we didn't.. so they went to waste.. As for the food, the minestrone soup, pasta and garlic bread were all  just Ok.. I have certainly had better.  The entrees we had were pretty good (Veal Parmesan and Masala) However, the linguine and clams was tasteless.  The worst part is this included \"wine\" they serve you.. Take my advice and either bring a good bottle or order one.. That was the biggest mistake we made.. the wine is horrible and made us all a bit sick afterwards..",

The menus are on the walls so it makes for easy ordering.  The food was good and it fills you up!  The hit of the whole show is that a little old man goes around playing his accordion and you can tell him songs to play.  He knows a lot of songs and is very skilled. I recommended eating here if staying in Vegas it's right behind the Flamingo.",

The only reason I can see people hyping this place up is because they're drunk off the all you can drink red/white wine. I personally am not big on wine so I ate sober...   Salad: It had a rectangular shaped peice of cheese on it and I think a cold cut slice of meat, which i was surprised by as I was asking about vegetarian items just 2 minutes before the salad came out... my mistake, I thought the salad was safe!  Bread: nothing special. Wasn't gross but it wasn't super offensive.   Eggplant Parmigiana: I just have had better. The red sauce was bland and the eggplant was covered in cheese which was overwhelming. There was soooooooo much cheese.  Side of pasta: literally,  a side dish of penne pasta with more bland red sauce on it.   Cappuccino: you know that machine at, like, all gas stations? Then you already know what this tastes like.  Service: not terrible,  but not super friendly or welcoming. Would it hurt to show some personality or ask some nom-invasive questions? Is this your first time here? Would you like to hear some customer favorites? Etc... no one explained the menu or asked us if we wanted anything other than the wine. We had to ask for a drink menu.   Ambiance: really dark version of Buca did Beppo. Really. Dark. Inside.   Overall, the word to describe this place is: meh.",

When I recieved my complimentry authentic garlic bread and was greeted by an older man by the name of \"Gordy\" I think he played the accordian and smiled and I felt SO happy and couldn't wait for the next up coming adventure this restaurant had to offer.  I took the first bite into heaven aslo known as the meatballs made with love.  And that was it I was in love. This is were I will eat Italian everytime I go to Vegas.

Red and White wine is included with dinner, I can't drink because i'm pregnant, but the family enjoyed it. The man says that the free red wine was good. :)  Also included with dinner is soup or salad, and garlic bread. The garlic bread was good, nice and warm. I really liked the dinner salad, but I had to pick some of the stuff out before I could eat it (no lunch meat or unpasteurized cheese), it was perfectly dressed though. The soup was run of the mill, nothing memorable.  I had spaghetti with meat sauce and a side of italian sausage. It tasted good, not great, but there was barely any sauce on it, and i'm the kind of girl that likes a lot of sauce with her pasta so I can dip bread in it. There was always a different person waiting on the table, never the same person twice, and they didn't come around that often, so I didn't get a chance to ask for more sauce. However, besides that, the staff was very friendly when they did come around, and the guy playing the accordion was adorable.  After dinner everyone gets free cappucino, ( yet another thing i can't have, WTF man, it's a conspiracy!) the family all enjoyed it.  When we go back to Vegas I don't think we'll head back here, overall it was just ok.",

We thought we'd have a nice, relaxing, long Italian meal with family and friends but after less than 45 minutes the waiter asked if we could leave because they needed the table for another party. Unreal. Half of our party wasn't even finished with their meal. For a bill in excess of $300 we should've at least been afforded the opportunity to order dessert or finish our wine.  It's super expensive. No dish cheaper than $23...and that was for simple spaghetti. The better dishes are $35 and up.  It's designed to push as many patrons through as they can. Unfriendly.

To get refills on wine or bread, etc, the waiter had to be reminded over and over. Food was just okay, I remember it been much better the last time we were here. Then what was most disappointing was the busboy actually asked us to leave while I was signing the bill. He said there was a time limit on the tables and he could pour the wine in to some cups and we could finish up in the bar area????  Because the restaurant is nostalgic, I like to bring visiting company to the restaurant. Unfortunately I'm crossing this one off the list now. Quality of food has changed and most of all customer service is most disappointing.",

The kids meals are $14 each and your only choices are spaghetti or raviolis. If you go just don't eat the salad, pretty sure that's how we got sick.",

    "text": "Another couple, my wife, and I flew into Las Vegas on a Sunday afternoon. We were hungry by dinner time but not excited by the hotel offerings. As a group we decided we wanted Italian food so we did a little online research and Battista's popped up. As we read reviews it looked interesting as something unique with good food. We called for a reservation and they were able to accommodate us. We snaked our way to the restaurant as it is a little off the beaten path plus you just can't walk across some of the streets in Las Vegas.   The restaurant was definitely old school. I saw a Tarzan poster signed by Johnny Weissmuller (the original Tarzan) along with lots of celebrity photos. We arrived at the restaurant and grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. They made good drinks or we just needed one.   We were then led back to a table and some garlic bread and carafes of red and white wine were set on the table. The waitress informed us the menu was the sign on the wall. There are six different priced sections on it with multiple entrees in each. I ordered Chicken Rio and it was delicious. My wife had Chicken Parmesan which she enjoyed, and our friends had lasagna which they liked. The food was good, not great. The atmosphere was loud and vibrant. This is not an intimate restaurant. There was a gentleman celebrating his birthday at the center table. He kept getting up making toasts to the staff and his family (I'm guessing the wine had taken hold).  He was fun, not obnoxious. The included salads, garlic bread, and cappuccino's at the end were all tasty.   Go have an old time Vegas experience. We did and we had a good time.",

So much so that my mother said the accordion player looked \"like he came with the place\" and my Aunt Sheila said the red \"tasted like communion wine.\"  Speaking of the accordion player, he looks like a shorter version of Sid Caesar and runs fast as hell when you tip him. He played literally one verse of a song, collected the tips we passed forward, and then bowed out and left. I doubt he knows more than one verse of anything.  \"The menu's on the wall\" threw off quite a few of us. After some of the older folks got their glasses on we figured out what we were eating. Everything comes with house wine, a salad or minestrone soup, the entree, plus cappuccino at the end. The salad was surprisingly delicious and I ate the entire thing. Entrees were pretty quick and I ate as much of the spaghetti and meat sauce that I could stomach. Boxes were plentiful, plus apparently refrigerators were not and I was the only one staying at Paris and got to take everything back to my room. Hopefully it will be equally delicious tomorrow,",

The hostess said it might even be sooner so when we were called 15 minutes later we were impressed.   Only to find it wasnt our name and the guy who seats people said \"Oh your wayyyyyy down the list\"  we went back to the bar area and sipped our cocktails, after 30 minutes they called a party of 3 that came in AFTER us so my boyfriend went up and asked \"whats up with that?\"  he was told the tables for 3 are different then the tables for 2 so they got to take cuts. REALLY ???    AND she said, you were told it would be 45 minutes for dinner, we both had that deer in the headlights look and said NO we werent, we were told 25 minutes, she said no you werent... I wrote it down,  Let me guess, she is someones daughter or wife that works there because she would not have her job if she wasnt.     We went back to the bar and attempted to order another drink and after sitting there 10 to 15 minutes, we had to get up to get another one.    Paid the bar tab ($45.00 for 2 drinks each) and was finally called to our table (after 55 minutes)  We were seated at a table the size for  6 (what happened to the party of 3? I didnt ask)   Ordered spaghetti and my boyfriend had veal,   Comeone folks - $50 dinner tab for that?

Who knew I would have love everything about this place. The place has been around forever. We were seated quickly and offered drinks just as fast. There are signs through out the restaurant that tell you your meal comes with either a red or white wine, soup or salad and to finish off your meal, a cappuccino. That's all included with the price of your meal. The entrees are also posted on the walls and the selection is plentiful. If your into pasta, they have it. Steak, no problem. It was just a great place to stop and eat. Oh, I forgot to mention the entertainment. There's a little guy. I'm guessing in his 70's who comes by your table and plays an accordion. Great stuff. If your in the area of Bally's, this is one for the bucket list.  I have pictures of the place and the little guy.  When I upload them, I'll post them for all to see.",

I didn't remember how expensive it was!  For some reason, I thought it was a lot cheaper... :(  Everyone's food was alright.  Nothing great or out of this world.  But one of our friends got the ziti w/ meatsauce and it tasted like soap!  The server took it back and brought out a new one, but it tasted the same.  We realized it was just a LOT of herbs that they used, but still... majority of the people at the table thought it tasted soapy.  Boo.",

I cannot speak for all the plates of food, but the Lasagna that I had was very very good and very large. It was about $25 for the meal, which included the Lasagna, salad or soup, beverage, hot chocolate drink, and unlimited wine. Not too bad. The food was great. The atmosphere is very quaint and cozy. LOTS of trinkets hanging around the place from the many years it has been there. Lots of famous people pictures on the wall with the original owner. Very nice. The servers were amazingly professional and friendly. Fast service for 30ppl was shocking. Everyone had a great time and the overall experience was perfect.   The only couple of things I can say in a negative light about this joint are as follows,  1. Food was a little expensive even with the unlimited (cheap) wine. 2. We had to wait a litte longer than expected for our table, however we did have 30 ppl, but we did have a reservation so we were expected.  Even with those little issues, I still think the place is a Woohoo! As good as it gets! Place. Enjoy.",

    "text": "We waited almost 2 hours for a table of 6 and it was not worth the wait. Food is overpriced for the quality. (entrees are at least $22) We saw our busser/food runner more often than our waiter who only came to take our order, bring our food and bring the check. He didn't even introduce himself or ask us how the food was.   The bad: You're entire group has to be present and then your wait time starts. It would have been a lot better if the hostess told me that crucial fact when I put my name on the wait list. She quoted us 45 min, that passed, then she said another 20 min, that passed, another 20 min, that passed, 15 min, finally a table. Get a reservation if you really want to try it. Got the pomodoro and the sauce was runny and watered down. My friends got the lasagna which is massive and the eggplant parm which was ok. The white wine tasted watered down, and didn't even smell like wine.  The good: unlimited wine. The red wine was actually ok, it's more sweet than dry. The salad and garlic bread was bomb. The \"cappuccino\" (it's hot chocolate with a shot of caffeine and whip cream) was good. The portions are big. It's a fun atmosphere (the accordian guy can't really play well but bless his heart he's adorable!) Food service is fast.   Don't think I'm coming back, or recommending this place to friends or guests unless they want the unlimited wine.",

You picked the entree off their extremely small but still varied menu...and it comes with all the red and / or white wine you care to drink...as well as a post-meal cappucino.  It was a tremendous find, and with prices being somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 for most everything on the menu, given all that's included...well, it's a must visit for anyone heading to Vegas who really enjoys good Italian Food, in a real \"hole-in-the-wall\" feel.  Unfortunately \"Gordy\" the accordion player was off on the night we went...but I would imagine that he only ads to the awesomeness of Battista's.  Have the Chicken Parmigiana...it was a great deal on a great deal of food.  Enjoy!",

They have a limited menu, such as they only have one salad dressing, though. It's not family style either, which you kind of assume it will be, so if you want to split add $10. The service is just fine and if you have a reservation you can be in and out quickly. I would go back at some point but I'd rather try several new places before then.",

The \"sauce\" with my linguini and clams tasted bland and odd (a little like I imagine dishwater might taste), but the pasta was cooked perfectly and there were tons of chopped clams.  Yes, the cheap wine is free, and if you don't mind it and intend on draining several carafes, go for it.  Gordy the accordian player popped by our table and sang a few bars of something and then was off to work the rest of the patrons.  He is cute as a button, but didn't make up for the merely adequate food.  The cappacino at the end was delicious, but as others have mentioned, tasted like hot chocolate, NOT even a hint of coffee flavor in there.    Soooooo .... Go for the free wine, the friendly service, and all of the eye candy on the walls, but don't expect a stellar meal.",

Menu divided into a few sections and grouped by price making it easy to decipher. Our waiter was outstanding and very energetic. The free flowing wine was average and the pasta was much like something you could put together with a jar of sauce and box of pasta from the grocery for $3 instead of the $27 or so there. However this is Vegas and you are vacationing in an expensive city. If you are looking for a romantic atmosphere or a place that clearly has a little history, you got it. However, great tasting food can be found elsewhere. (Sorry no photos. It was pretty dark in there.)",

It's easy to miss this hole in the wall.  I've been several times before yelling and overall pretty happy. Service can be real hit or miss, usually just okay so have to lower my rating. The server today left mid meal and never came back, needed water, didn't put dressing on the side of the salad like asked or come back to check in. Even with that I was still happy because of the decent value and fun atmosphere.  You get lots of tasty bread that comes with butter and garlic. Entrees include either salad or soup but I like to get both. Entrees include wine and also a cappuccino at the end.   The lasagna is just right portion of meat, cheese, noodle ratio and good flavors. Nothings really super amazing but I've been happy overall and like this place a lot.   Service needs work though. It's decent sometimes but the last guy went home without saying anything. Haha  Refills were lacking. The cappuccinos are made bunch at a time and get luke warm.   I'll be back though and hope to update with improvements.",

Set aside the food and the menu for a second and you still have a terrific vibe. I haven't seen a live polka with accordion since hector was a pup! I could walk around this place for hours just admiring the photos and history. I imagine that this place has stories that would make the Vegas Stories Hall Of Fame!    We came in with a party of 8 and I think this is THE place for a group. The menu is all inclusive. The price on the board includes a main course, an appetizer, a side salad or soup, dessert and red or white wine. You're not going to leave with an empty stomach! Once your seated and comfortable, I suggest you start looking around. There's local memorabilia from floor to ceiling. It's worth walking around the halls, just to catch a couple \"oohs\" and \"aahs\"!    We eventually put in our order and the meal started to unfold course by course. The carafe of wine and garlic bread came first and the table got instantly happy. The bread was warm and delicious and with the red wine flowing, the mood started to really lighten up. The salad came out and we started to nosh even more and talk less. It was a standard Italian salad with big chunks of salami. It tasted great and to have garlic bread with Italian salad is an amazing start to a meal. The bread, salad and wine and company were all part of a joyful experience. This polka guy came by and gave us a happy medley to lift our spirits even higher.    I order the chicken parm and when it arrived it was cooked through with the texture remaining crisply while the cheese and sauce was still sizzling from the oven. The side of pasta was standard with a simple red sauce. I'm really happy with my choice and even happier with the location and the experience we had. I was treated like family by all the wonderful people at Battista's. If you want an original or non cookie cutter meal, this is it! It's truly one of a kind!",

The dinner comes with wine, the waiter Derek, left two carafes-one white and one red, drinkable but not good; being from CA wine country we're a bit picky, but we drank it, we have had worse.  The cappuccino was a sweet machine job with whipped cream on top.  Cool place but we will not return.",

    "text": "This little place has been here forever and big-concrete-vegas grew around it, so it's behind the strip under the Linq in a not great area, but whatever. We've all been to little low-ceiling-dark-lit-supposed-to-be-intimate restaurants, right? This place takes it to an extreme. It is SO DARK you need a phone or flashlight to read the menu. It hurt my eyes it was so dark. And then when you're done, you go walk back out and are blinded! I think they keep it dark so you don't see how dirty it is. They do the kitsch-gaudy-stuff-all-over-the-walls-cluttered thing and its all very dusty...which I could only tell by touching it. What's the point of stuff all over the walls and hanging from the ceiling if its so dark you cant even see it?! Now on to the food. It was ok. I'd say one step above olive garden? Here's the problem: your meal 'comes with free' wine and cappuccino. \"Free\" of course meaning included in the price of your meal...which is exorbitant. Almost $40 for a steak? $30 for a pasta dish? You'd expect it to be huge but no, its average sized. Plus, there's no salad options. The ONLY salad they have is a little cereal bowl sized side salad but there is a $13 minimum per person. So if you're not that hungry or just want a salad, that tiny bowl of lettuce is $13! Because 'it comes with free wine and cappuchino' no its not free! Its bundled! We didn't even drink the wine OR the cappuccino but we're still paying for it because they're included in the price. If you want ok food AND wine (that you dont get to pick out) AND cappuccino AND you have night vision goggles? Then sure, check this place out. Otherwise? Go to a more modern, updated, and well lit restaurant. You'll get more for your money and won't get a headache from eye strain.",

If you are going to try this place out I recommend making a reservation. For the price you get a choice of a salad or Soup, garlic bread, an entree, and a cappuccino. The Italian salad is amazing, I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs and my husband ordered lasagna. Both entrees were okay, the cappuccino served for dessert was pretty good.",

The cappuccino is another thing that's awesome!  I just wish I could have 10 of those.  It sucks that you have to have a dinner if you don't they charge you $13 on top of what you order so you might as well get the dinner.  Dinner great for me, but my teens that eat like birds are such a waste.  Lasagna has a lot of cheese and meat.. it's great.  Spaghetti is a little dry.. fettuccine a little pasty but great chicken, cacciatore was great (has a bell pepper flavor), soup was good, salad has the spinach/weeds mixture lettuce, bread has lots of Parmesan cheese.  I love it.  Gosh I'm a pig.. yes I had everything cause those damn kids are a waste.",

Included in your dinner is a carafe of wine, breadsticks, soup/salad, an entree and cappuccino. It was really busy when we came in but the service was still great. We told the server we were in a little bit of a time crunch because of a show and he made sure everything came out to us on time.  The soup and garlic bread were amazing and my favorite part. The red wine was a little sweet for me, but alright. Wish I knew we could have gotten 2 smaller carafes of each wine.   My entree was alright. I had the meatballs and ziti. The pasta was a LITTLE hard, not too bad. The meatballs were pretty good. My boyfriend had the eggplant and loved it.   We will definitely be coming back for the price and service.",

But I've lived in vegas for 5 years, being from New Jersey I've eaten the best in Jersey and All the 5 boroughs in New York. And believe me between Vegas and Henderson there are some really excellent italian restaurants....I'm 100% italian and in the food business. So I know what food should taste, look, smell like....First off I've passed this joint 100 times...always said one day I'll give it a shot...so the other night I did....my foodie partner and I walk in...first I think wow this joint is gonna be great...just by the ambiance of kinda vintage ol' school Vegas...so I give it and 8 for appearance....not clean or organized at all but that doesn't mean it's gonna be a bad joint...now we sit down and we are given Red wine on the house with little tasting glasses which I loved...thought man this joint is going on my list...ok skip ahead to the menu on the wall...yeah u read that right....there's a huge ass menu on the wall with the normal shit on it...MEATBALLS, SPAGHETTI, CHICKEN PARM, EGGPLANT PARM, u get the idea....ok no big deal this is what this guy offers, ok so be it. Now for the prices? And I ain't cheap by any means, this place is a joke...but we order anyway thinking small menu, high prices he has to use top of the line products...yeah not so much...I order eggplant Parm with a side of Meatballs...my buddy ordered chicken rio, ok so now the garlic bread comes along with my complimentary salad and his soup, he said the soup was average and my salad was good, crispy romaine sliced Mozzarella not fresh but restaurant depot or Sysco crap...ok no big deal...now 7 min after ordering our food comes out...yes i time the order to the time I'm served....RED Flag...right away...no way that's cooked to order...it came out my gravy tasted like pure sugar and dark...which means he uses a shit tomato and that gravy has been cooking all day down to a thick transmission fluid like state...and full of oil..the Meatballs were hard as rocks, means he only uses a shit beef in them and then bakes them off which is ok if u use the right mix...they where dead to me not soft and firm like a good Meatball should be and tasteless no garlic or fresh Grated Parm Regg in them just BLAH...my eggplant itself was ok...but the gravy ruined the taste for me...my buddies chicken rio was dry and bland and fell apart which means it was made earlier in the day and sat in a cold drawer and just put in a pan with that cream sauce over rottini macaroni.....awful to serve that shit....take pride in your food... Now we decided to order a slice of taramisu ok store bought shit or made last Monday it was sour and smelt like what ever fridge it was in....and the complimentary \"cappuccino \" was that Swiss miss hot chocolate and cappuccino mix...with a shit load of whip cream on it..actually best part of the meal....this joint sucks...this ain't italian food....save yourself the trip....will I be back....only against my will....sorry guys if u read this...take some pride in your food and taste it before it leaves the kitchen.",

Food wasn't too bad---there is just a lot of it--which depending on your appetite can be a good or a bad thing.  All dinners come with the unlimited house red and white wine, soup or salad, a side of pasta, and a cappuccino at the end of your meal.    Hubby had the steak pizziola and I had the chicken rio---both were pretty tasty.  The garlic bread nothing to get excited over.

    "text": "I NEED MORE ACCORDION!  I also need more wine too!!!  Yes if you are looking for that in Vegas, then you will find both here. And honestly we do need more of thesr things in the shadow of Sin City to have a good time.   The name here is cute but it is not really a whole in the wall.  It's not a dive restaurant. It just happens to be a restaurant off the strip and hidden behind the Flamingo Hilton/Barbary Coast Casinos.   You will find a wait here. In fact, make a reservation if you can.  This place is simple.  Order a meal and for a fixed price you get salad, main course, cappuccino and all you can drink wine. It is a deal.   I've had many memorable dinners here.  One of my favorites was with my wife, who happened to be my girlfriend at the time. We had a great meal and the carafe's of wine were flying off the table. Honestly by the time we left here, I'm not even sure we ate food. That was the wine talking. Long story short we ended up at the Bellagio with a private concert with Wyclef John. I am going to give Battista's and there bottomless wine the credit here. We must have looked like a fun couple standing in front of the dancing waters.  My words of advice...fun things happen to people having fun!  Okay back to Battista's...the food is not going to win any awards.  It is just basic old school Vegas Italian. If your looking for a 5 star reality show winner chef experience then go somewhere else. This place is about having fun.   I've also had a few work dinners here too and we've had some great times. I attribute that to the wine again. The wine sitting on the table is hard for anyone to resist it. So people who normally don't drink will pour themselves a few wines and why not because its on the house.   I want to mention the accordion player because it is big part of this place.  He is so cute but all he wants is that dollar or two.  He walks from table to table working the whole room. He probably makes a $100,000 per year. I remember once he walked up to our table.  Asked me, \"Where you from kid?\". I said, \"Chicago\". And he jumped in and started playing the song, Chicago by Sinatra.  And when he finished the song he threw out his hand like gimme 5 but he didn't want my hand slapping his unless there was a green bill in it.  This is a novelty here and I think it keeps people coming back for more.   So if your looking for something different from the usual Vegas Strip drama, then I highly recommend you check this place out. It is a fun time and if your not having fun, then have some more wine!",

Ariel aka  Papa came up to every table & gave them excellent service & made sure had everything they needed.

Nostalgia galore with prominent and proud photos of many of the stars through the years.   I'm not sure you're really coming here for the food but it's all in all decent and not too hard on the pocketbook for a night out in Vegas.   We had Chicken Rio, lasagna and cannelloni. No one could finish our meals. The table wine that comes with your meal isn't 90point wine but decent enough with dinner.",

    "text": "This is definitely a fun little spot for a mom and pop feel Italian restaurant. Located (basically) underneath the High Roller next to the LINQ, it's rather easy to get to for locals and visitors alike. It is a very quick Lyft from the strip, and for locals they have their own private lot. The lot is FREE. This is of course now rare when dining on the Strip (so it is HIGHLY appreciated).   Battista's is always busy, so you should absolutely make a reservation prior to arriving. Especially if you plan to visit on a weekend, or when there is a large event in town (so basically always). You can make a reservation directly on their website, and they'll email confirmation of your reserved time, very convenient.   Note that they do not split checks here, so if you plan to bring a group, either all bring cash to pay, or know one person will need to pay the tab and be paid back by the group (my personal friend circle uses Venmo and it works wonders).   When you arrive, you will walk through a mini corridor and into a mood lit place that is much larger than it appears. The hostess stand will be right in front of you with the small bar area to your left (you can sit here and order apps, but you must be seated to have dinner). We always sit here first and order drinks while we wait to be seated. It works well. Once your table is ready they will announce it over the speaker and lead you to your table. Once seated, they'll direct you to the walls to see their menu and specials. Its pretty much everywhere so no matter where you sit you'll be able to have a view of the menu. ALL of their dinners come with soup or salad, bread, and for dessert a cappuccino! So fun! The food itself is definitely above average. Not the best Italian I ever had, but still delicious and the servers are always friendly and quick. Did I mention the meals also included unlimited house wine??? You read that right, free red AND white house wine with dinner. Is it the best wine ever? Yes, because it's free wine!   Overall a fun little place to take the family and enjoy some good Italian food.",

As soon as we were sat we were left at the table for about 15 minutes, one of the waiters came over and dropped off the free wine, and 2 glasses of water, never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. Never really welcomed us to the restaurant. Another waiter came over and let us know that the menu was on the wall, basically a wall menu for the whole room. There are no descriptions of the food in said menu. Once we were served our dinner we were only checked on once, we were never asked if we wanted dessert, they just brought us the free cappuccino and the check. Mind you I had let them know it was my best friends birthday. The food was ok, the service was bad, every different waiter that came to our table seemed miserable. I myself am a server so I don't like to complain, I try to be understanding if the place is busy. But our whole section which consisted of about 5 tables seemed to get the same service. I was very disappointed and apologized to my friend.  I won't be back.",

It is your standard Italian fare and the food was good, I would put it on par with Maggiano's or Bucca. The restaurant is dark - great for a date night - and there is an adorable old man who comes around with his accordion and sings (for tips of course). The wine is included with your meal - your choice of red or white - and the biggest point being it is unlimited which I think may be their claim to fame? Our service was good and overall we had a nice time here - I think it is definitely one of those places you just have to try at least once if you are in Vegas.",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite italian restaurant in Las Vegas.  \"Used to be\" are the key words!   First off we had to wait for a table for 30 minutes in a half empty restaurant!   What's that about? Some sort of marketing ploy to make people think they were doing better then they are?  They winded up giving us a tiny booth in the back of the place in a dark corner where we could not even read the menu! Super depressing.  Now, Let's start with the food.   First off, the bread. YUCK! The place used to give you really good italian bread and now you get cheap supermarket italian bread that is called \"garlic bread. It's looks to be greased up with cheap margarine and topped with way too much parmesan cheese to disguise the cheapness of the bread! We had to send it back! It was gross! As the saying goes, you can always tell a meal by the bread!  The next course was the salad. It looked and tasted like it had been sitting for a week. The lettuce was all wilted and brown and they tried to disguise it with extra croutons and (again) that same parmesan cheese. It was one of the worse salads I have had in my life!  For the main course I had eggplant parmesan!  It looked and tasted like 3 day old fried eggplant, and was chewy and flavorless. I wonder if it was fried in canola oil, which is a GMO. That would explain why it tasted so bad!   My partner had the chicken parm. It was barely cooked and tasted like cheap fake plastic chicken that you would get in some fast food joint. Definitely not quality food.  We left most of our dinner, paid the $75 bill and walked out.   It had to be the worse meal we both ever had! And will never return!    When we got home we both got so sick from the little that we did eat. We believe it may have been food poisoning or way too many GMO's being used in the cheap food!    The place is not the same!  Something happened to it! Maybe new management, maybe new ownership! They are cutting corners big time! And in the end, it will be this restaurant's demise!  It's a darn shame, because this place is part of Las Vegas nostalgia. They just want to be a tourist trap now. Forget the locals! They want to get them in and don't care if they come back! Well guess what, not on my dime!",

This is a hole in the wall that should be spackled over, sanded, painted, and then set on fire to collect the insurance money.  Because that kind of thing NEVER happens in Italian restaurants.",

I have been there many time over the last XX years (too many), and it's always the same and that's part of the charm and why I will always feel at home. And that's a good feeling in Vegas sometimes.  The cocktails are good, skip the complimentary wine. It'll give you a headache but it works for an expense account and hey, it's part of the deal. We always like to sit in the bar area for at least 30 minutes just to calm down, chat up some old folks and take in the show. It's dark and clubby, TV's on the wall, really old cracked Naugahyde stools and Formica bar tables. No upscale design elements, thank you very much.  The menu is on blackboards all around. Just get what you like and maybe add a meatball. I always get Eggplant Parm and a side of two meatballs. You get pasta included and the iceberg lettuce salad or minestrone. Right? You're with me now, I feel it. I think the gravy/sauce is right on, slightly sweet, tomato-y, thick and rich. Of course the Parmesan cheese is in a little shaker along side the red pepper flakes.  Veal is good, lasagna is wonderful and since I always get the same thing, I can only go by what my colleagues tell me. I think you can get garlic bread instead of the \"white Italian loaf\" that comes with the meal.  If you are a little tired of how hard Vegas tries to be au courant, then relax and go to the Hole in the Wall. Then take a long walk back to your hotel or casino and enjoy the sights with a full belly and a happy countenance!",

From the atmosphere, to the food, to the adorable gentleman playing the accordion, it is a fun, reasonably priced unique experience off the craziness of the strip.  We loved the eggplant parmigiana and lasagna, both in generous servings, and the included bread and soup were tasty as well. The did I mention the included wine? The cappuccino was so amazing, we almost went back later for another cup! We will definitely be returning to Battista's on our next Vegas trip.",

Not only did my family return all of our meals because the sauce was sour and over seasoned but nothing was fresh or hot, they still had the audacity to charge us for sir charge which was 14 dollars a person. So unless you enjoy being served disgusting food and go to a restaurant that suits its name, eat at your own risk.",

Here's your wine (all-you-can-drink), \"You want soup or salad?\", here's your bread, order off the menu that's on the wall, and you get cappuccino that tastes suspiciously like ovaltine at the end. Perfect before a night of drinking and dabauchery.  Restaurant can get pretty busy (30-45 minute wait), but no prob, just pop on over to Stage Door next door for a quick drink. Mamasan (the best bartender ever) gave us a $10 off coupon. Thanks!  I'm notorious for eating off if everyone's plate, and it's all good. I notoriously avoid carbs in California, but savor the garlic bread here. Comfort food at its finest. I almost always get the chicken Parmesan and it's seriously better every time I order it. Oh, and the portions are HUGE. Come hungry AND thirsty!",

It also has included unlimited garlic bread, soup or salad, and unlimited wine.  My wife and I are not big eaters so it made sense for us to split as we often do.  It's not a matter of being cheap its quantity.  This is why I am so-so on this place because the food was ok in my opinion.  My wife thought it was good.  We got the eggplant parmigiana.  It was done nicely but it is baked not fried.  This isn't a problem for us because we are health conscious anyways.  If you are eating and drinking on a budget I recommend this place or if you are looking for a lot of decent food for a \"reasonable\" price.  Otherwise there are better places to go.    One last note.  There is a $13 charge for the additional person that doesn't order a meal in addition to the cost of the plate but you get a salad/soup and all the wine and garlic bread.  I should add this also come with a side of some basic pasta too.  This is totally reasonable.  so again if you are looking to fill up on the cheap then this is it.  P.S.  I forgot they finish the dinner off with a cappuccino which was very nice!",

My man wants to feel bad that I'm eating alone but I put that to rest quick with a request for something sappy an' let him know I wouldn't have it another way.  My man works for tips and it bums me out that a couple of old handbags in windbreaker jumpsuits want to take selfies with him but can't throw a five down on it. Them's chumps.  The old school Italian borders on absurd, but it's fun absurd.  Skip the dinner salad-- it's too depressing to think of someone in the kitchen counting out radishes and tomato slices, factory-makin' your greens.  Just get at that steak and drink deep straight from the carafe.",

The decor is nice, and clearly vintage. There are dozens of pictures of celebrities on the walls. We were seated in a back room near he kitchen, and quickly started thinking we were forgotten. It took a good 10 or 12 minutes before a waiter approached our table again. I was worried the service would be terrible and we would be there for hours.  I was proven very wrong. As soon as a waiter came to our table we had our bread in seconds, salads and soup maybe 2 minutes later, main course within 10 minutes, and coffee as soon as dinner was done.  The service was so fast I was stunned. Now the food:  I ordered the Chicken Parm, which came with free unlimited house wine (red and white, both quite good), soup or salad (I got the salad, kind of a cross between a regular Italian salad and antipasto; it had lettuce and dressing and olives and also salami and pepperoncini), a pasta side, garlic bread, and cappuccino.  Everything was delicious, and the price was very cheap for being so close to the Strip. I will not go to Vegas again without a stop at Battista's.",

He was such a professional with all of our special request, hopefully he waits on you when you visit! Can't say enough about Gordy the accordion player! Most of the family is from Ohio, and he rocked out the Ohio State fight song for an impromptu sing along!  This is a must visit when in Las Vegas!

Garlic bread and salad came next. I usually don't like an oil-based dressing but this one was so delicious! I ate up the whole thing. For dinner, I chose the chicken alfredo. It was a perfect portion of pasta and coated perfectly in just enough sauce. The chicken on top was so tender and fell apart with a touch of the fork. It was so delicious! Soon after we were finished, the cappuccino came next. It was so yummy! I'm not usually a cappuccino person but this one was nutty, creamy, and sweet. So good!   What I love most was it was all included for one price. There was no question of what the final bill would be and they were so efficient in getting all the food and drinks coming quickly one after the other. Can't wait to go back!",

I love Italian food and was surprised when we walked in that they were able to accommodate 10 of us without a reservation. They brought us 2 bottles each of red and white wine, which are served FREE with every meal. :D I ordered the lasagna for $25.95 and it was excellent. Each meal includes either a salad or minestrone soup, garlic bread, and an after-dinner cappuccino (plus that free wine!) It was really loud and difficult to hear the person talking right next to you, but the quality of the food, and the expertise of our waitress who knew every detail of every menu item and recited them without hesitation upon request made up for that. The cutest old man with an accordion played us a nice little jig as well. Having recently visited Italy, the authenticity of the feast, friends, and fun felt like I was experiencing it all over again. My group thought Battista's looked shady from the outside and it kind of does since it's attached to a liquor store, but we were all pleasantly surprised and impressed. I highly recommend for the value, quality, service, and just-off-the-strip location hidden from tourists.",

The all you can drink house red and white were already in carafes on our table and we were ready for more merriment.  Fairly loud restaurant (or maybe we were the ones being loud) that can easily accommodate large groups such as ours.  I'm actually surprised that we weren't kicked out with all the f-bombs that we were dropping.  The food seemed well rehearsed, as the bread came out quickly, as well as, the standard single-serving sides of salad or soup.  Our pasta orders were placed fairly quickly and the meal arrived on room service carts.   The after dinner cappuccino, with a healthy dollop of \"whipped cream\", arrived just as quickly afterwards.  Food is not too spectacular (seemed fairly Costco-y if you know what I mean) but the service was quick and they have a doorman that can take care of your after dinner entertainment.     Parking lot was right in front of the restaurant and fairly safe despite the look of the neighborhood.  They let me leave my car there, overnight, and it was alright the next day.    Made reservations and had to put down 10% on a credit card due to our large party size.    ~$32.5 pp including autograt of 20%.  I probably won't go back for the food, but works for large groups, not interested in buffets but interested in drinking copious amounts of cheap wine in plastic cups.  (2* for food, 4* for service)",

    "text": "On vacation, you do touristy things.  This is one of them.  As you look around, you can tell the dated decor has been home to many travelers of the past.  Business cards of past customers line the walls.  The pictures on the wall contain a rich history of the restaurant and the surrounding city.  As you eat, a charming accordion player makes his rounds.  Much has been written about the food, so I won't spill more ink on it (the spinach was the worst I ever had and the free wine reflects what you pay for it).  Rating the food only, I'd give this place two stars.  However, I think you go here for the experience of going to an old-world tourist trap and doing so inexpensively.  In that sense, I think the experience is worth a higher rating and I'll be penciling this place in on my next visit to Vegas.",

    "text": "Bachelorette party this past weekend and one of the gals made reservations here.  From what I hear it's been in the same location longer than 35 years and it's family owned.  The decor is kitchy...very old corny Italian place with a wall full of shot glasses and small liquer bottles, stuffed moose, turkey and other items.   The service was QUICK and much appreciated.  The staff was helpful and nice.  The overall idea is, I think, what Bucca tries to achieve.  The menu's on the wall...I ordered eggplant...yumm-o for the most part.  All dishes come with house wine (complimentary), garlic bread, salad or soup, entree, a pasta side (if pasta's not already somehow included in the dish) and cappucino.  Salad was not tasty at all...garlic bread was OK...eggplant was outstanding, pasta was ok, cappucino had yummy whipped cream on it and that's about all I have to say.  Oh,....the red wine was great.  All this for about $25 per person.   The BEST part was the little old guy playing the accordian table to table.  He asked what we were celebrating and then sang \"Get Me to the Church on Time\".....best 2 second show of my life.  Overall...I MAY return if someone really begs for it.",

Food is not good (worst veal parm I have ever had), service sucked (dude was trying to fake an Italian accent, really demeaning) and the wine was horrible (it doesn't matter if its free).  When you are in Vegas you should treat yourself to a quality meal.  Do not come to Battista's because it seems like a great deal (its not).  The money you save on the all-inclusive option just isn't worth it.  There are only a handful of places worth leaving the strip for and this isn't one of the them.  Please do not trust the positive reviews and stay away.",

On this visit I had the chicken parmegiana and was so glad I did. This hot cheesy, tomato, perfectly piece of chicken may easy be the best meal I had on my vacation. I expected it to be salty for a place that is so busy and just turning out customers. BUT IT WASN'T.   Our servers, Frank and, I believe, Gabriel were very fun, attentive and ensured everything was good.   Honestly cant wait to come back.

    "text": "We stopped in here for dinner this evening. This place is closer to the strip then we generally like to come, but we've been wondering about this place for a long time. So tonight was the night.  As we assumed traffic was a mess on Saturday night. We managed to get there on time for our reservation.  There were three girls working the desk when we walked in. They really need a lesson on how to greet guests that walk through the door. When we let them know we had a reservation they gave the attitude that we were bothering them. Oh well, let them go through life miserable. We were here to enjoy ourselves.   Our waiter was Doug, and he was awesome!  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. My wife ordered ziti with meat balls. Both were excellent.  The meal comes with .... soup or salad.  A basket of bread.  Two large carafes of wine. One red and one white. After dinner cappuccinos   We also ordered a tiramisu for dessert.  Our total came to around $50. Can't complain about the price especially with all that comes with the meal.  I enjoyed the ambiance. The old photos on the wall really speaks to the history of the place.  They had an accordion player walking around playing music for folks.  The only negative I could find about this place, other than the 3 socially inept girls working the front, was this is another one of those places that likes to pack in the guest. Your so close to your fellow diners that you can practically join in on their conversations.  I know you want to get as many paying customers in as you can, but you've got a great reputation here. I'd rather pay a little more and have some elbow room.  All in all we really enjoyed ourselves here.",

I commented the night before that it looked like you'd get stabbed if you were at the street corner the restaurant is located at but little did I know that this place was a hidden gem.  The lighting and decor are classic Italian. There is a very intimate feel and I felt like I was right at home. It was complete with a elderly gentleman who came around and sang to us with an accordion.   I gave it 4 out of 5 because the sauce was a little mild and sweet but the quality was a 10 out of 10. It's located right behind the Cromwell/flamingo and it's about a three minute walk from the uber pick up at the flamingo.  The meal came with either a salad or soup, main course which is served with wine and bread, and they bring you a cappuccino with fresh whipped cream (or a shot of lemon cello for a small fee). The service was out of this world and we had a waiter, server, and someone to get our drinks, which meant that we never wanted anything while we were eating because it was always taken care of. When we left, we boxed up our food, and the server even brought us more bread to take with us.  We will definitely be returning to this place every time we come to Vegas, I will recommend it to anyone who asks for a good place to eat. They don't make places like this anymore!",

We were seated shortly before we finished our first drink at the bar. We were met with 2 carafe's of wine - white and red. I think they should ask you what your preference was as in our case they didn't have to bring the white (was wasted)  My wife had the Eggplant Parm and I had the chicken fettuccine. She ended up not liking it but I think she tried it only due to her friend's recommendation but never had it before. It looked okay to me! My Fettuccine was definitely hand made and the Alfredo sauce was tasty. The serving was more than ample. The after dinner cappuccino was a nice touch.  As a side note the accordionist is a nice touch but I think he's about ready to call it a day. You rarely saw him as I imagine he tires out quite a bit thru the evening and takes a number of breaks.

We ordered the chicken parmigiana and shrimp alfredo, it was honestly so bad we couldn't eat it. The shrimp tasted rubbery and tasteless and the chicken parmigiana was so bad that spaghettio's was a 5 star comparison to the garbage we were served. Even the server wasn't surprised when we told him it was bad. It was like he already knew how bad it was before he even served us. He didn't try to comp the food or apologize, but instead gave us a $75 dollar check.....so we downed all the warm wine provided and went back to our room to have the night we should have had at this restaurant.

When you enter to the left there's a bar with some high tables.  It seems like people were in this area to drink.  My group got a drink as we waited for a table.  I was craving a Moscow mule, and I did appreciate the server telling me it wouldn't be in a copper mug (because that's the best way to drink a mule) however it tasted pretty weak. And my drink cost close to $10...yeah not doing that again.  We were finally seated in this little dining room.  Good for small groups.  I had a party of five, so we were probably at the biggest table available.  Right away they brought out water and a complimentary jug of red and white wine...sweet! They were served in small glasses, so you don't go overboard on the wine.   The menus were big signs on each of the three walls.  There weren't tons of options, but you had your traditional Italian dishes.   After ordering our food we were served tastiest garlic bread I've ever had.  The bread was soft, buttery, and seasoned to perfection.  With your meal you had the choice of soup or salad.  I got the soup which was minestrone which was decent...it looked better than the salad.   I ordered the lasagna for my meal.  It was big, meaty, and cheesy.  Very pleased with my meal. Kind of glad that I didn't finish it, so I had leftovers for later.  To top it all off, the meal ended with a cappuccino and whip cream.  I'm not a cappuccino person, but the drink was warm and comforting, and terrific way to end the meal.  All that cost each of us $25.  It's worth its value if you take advantage of everything that was offered.    A couple of things to note.  I noticed they never asked if we wanted anything else to drink.  I'm sure they would have got us something if we asked but was surprised that they didn't.  I was satisfied with the jug of wine.  The service was spot on, but not very friendly or personable.  When one of the servers was trying to be friendly, it felt more awkward.  She was commenting on the smell of a friend's lotion...weird.   Thanks Uber Driver for the recommendation it was a great meal!",

    "text": "My daughter and I decided to eat here on a Saturday night. We have lived in Vegas for over 15 years and this was the first time we have dined here.   I made a reservation on OpenTable, but when we arrived, they did not have my reservation. I showed the gal my confirmation of the reservation and she gladly accommodated us. The other gal that sat us didn't really seat us.  She brought us to the one room in the restaurant and pointed out the table we were supposed to sit at. I feel like she had a lethargic attitude and couldn't be bothered with showing us to our table.   As soon as we sat down, the server's assistant gave us water and then our server, Giovanni, brought us a carafe of red and white wine. my daughter is not of age and he removed her little wine glass. He explained that the menus were on the wall and he would be back to take our order.   I ordered the ribeye and my daughter had the ravioli. The meal included garlic bread and your choice of minestrone soup or house salad. We both had the salad. The bread was really buttery and garlicky. The ribeye was good and cooked medium rare like I had asked. It came with potatoes, creamed spinach, and a side of ziti pasta with marinara sauce on it. My daughter's ravioli came with marinara sauce on it. The portions are big at this restaurant.   The house wine was decent. It included with your meal, so you can't really expect it to be Opus One quality or anything like that. It's house wine... just drink it.   We got full and ended up packing up half our entrees to go and then Giovanni brought us our cappuccinos (included with the meal) and our check. Throughout the meal, Giovanni checked on us to make sure our meal was satisfactory. All in all, we will be back. The only reason it was 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the 2nd hostess who pointed out the table instead of walking us to our table.",

The prices are a bit high, but when you consider that it includes soup/salad, garlic bread and unlimited wine, it ends up being a decent deal.  If you don't drink wine, not so much.  The salad was excellent, as was the garlic bread.  I had the garlic shrimp, essentially shrimp scampi on pasta, and I had no complaints.  My friend had the ziti with sausage sauce, which he considered a bit bland.  I would recommend this place for a nice bite to eat.",

Have stopped by twice now and have tried the traditional (and as basic as it is, my favorite italian meal) Spaghetti with meatballs and the Manicotti. The sauce is hearty and sweet and is delicious on its own or used for dipping your garlic bread. I loved the Manicotti as well because it was filled with cheesy goodness mixed with spinach, enhancing thr overall meal. I asked for more red sauce to drench it     Regardless, of your meal it comes with a salad or soup, a cappuccino and all-you-can-drink red and white wine. This girl was in love lol.  All in all, a great deal for you, a delightful venue, complete with a serenade, and a heavenly meal.   I look forward to stopping by again!",

The place isn't all fancy and modern, but it has a cozy feel to it. The food was GREAT!! each meal selection comes with soup or salad, a bread basket, red and white wine, and at the end...a hot cup of cappuccino topped with whipped cream.  The servers did an excellent job. The place is lively..you hear people having a good time at their table, laughing and having conversations.  Its right in the center of Las Vegas action, however its sorta on the side..and parking spots are not an issue...we found one as soon as we drove up. I would definitely come back.  I give them 2 thumbs up",

I was embarrassed I had even picked this place after the experience my guests experienced while eating at the restaurant. First I will start with the hostess a young girl very long hair who was extremely rude upon our arrival but I said nothing hoping that maybe she was just having a bad day. We were seated and everything seemed quite rushed the waiter only came to the table twice and there was a party of eight of us who were left wishing we had additional drinks but we're not asked . At one point I had asked another waiter for a drink which did not come. when the bill came The drinks were on there but never received. The second time the waiter came back I asked him about the bill we also would like to have split the bill on a couple different credit cards and he said that was not possible we were unaware of this and he kind of laughed at us snarky was rude about it and when we seemed upset but he said he would try to fix it and charge multiple credit cards. Overall I thought the staff was rude didn't feel they had time to accommodate our table or any of our questions. I will never visit this restaurant again. The only positive thing I can say is that the elderly man who plays the accordion is awesome. Thankfully he was able to make my family visiting Las Vegas happy during this not so great dinner experience.",

The only thing I can think is that most people don't get a chance to have Italian food often.   First the portions were not huge or even big.  They were average at best.  The highlight of the entire meal was the salad.  I had the Chicken Parm and it wasn't terrible but I would not send anyone there to try it.  The chicken was bland and the sauce wasn't much better.  In regard to the value...  $30 for a small salad, chicken parm, watered down wine and what they called cappuccino is far from a value.  If it was $12.99 i might agree.  Free wine!  I'm not sure you could even call it wine.  It was more like water with a taste of wine.    Cappuccino... it was closer to powered hot chocolate  The service was good so they earned two stars.  There are many other options in Vegas if you are looking for a deal that provide much better food and an atmosphere that doesn't resemble a cluttered basement.",

    "text": "I can't believe all this time I've been in Vegas and I've never been to Battista's. And all it took to get me here was a cousin visiting from another state who heard about it from her customers there. For shame. Nevertheless, we came here tonight to celebrate our birthdays. Our birthdays are just a couple of days (and 11 years) apart. So it was a mutual dinner celebration. She likes to make a bigger deal than I do so she wore a birthday sash. Almost as soon as we were seated the little old man who plays the accordion came by to play for us. He ended up playing Happy Birthday (twice throughout our dinner). That was a real treat.  The menu here is not extensive. And it is broken down by price. That is to say each price point has a handfull of options to choose from. There were five of us tonight. Three lasagnas were ordered. One chicken alfredo. I ordered eggplant parm.   Aside from the entrees, we were also served our choice of soup or salad. Its hot out so most of us ordered salad. It was a good salad too. Basically an anitpasti salad with meats, cheese, olives and pepperoncinis with a tangy Italian dressing. Standard but good. The minestrone looked good too but I did not try that.   Also on the table for our enjoyment was garlic bread and wine. Both red and white wines. They were both house wines and nothing spectacular but they come with the meal. I can live with that. I enjoyed the red more than the white. I usually do. The garlic bread was crisp and buttery. Garlic bread done right.  My eggplant parm was of a generous portion. Several slices of fried and layered goodness topped with sauce and a lot of cheese. It came served with a side of penne and marinara. The lasagnas and chicken alfredo looked good too. Again, generous portions. They all had left overs. Me, being the fatso I am, did not.   Finally, to cap off our already fantastic dinner, we were brough capuccino. Really more of a rich hot chocolate. Its a bit warm in August to be drinking a hot beverage on top of a filling meal but it sure was good. We all agreed it was about the best hot chocolate we had ever had.  This place may be called Battista's Hole In The Wall but it really is not. The place is huge. Deceptively so. It is dimly lit and full of kitch. There is a certain amount of retro charm that just feels right. Now that I have been here I want to come back. I want to share this with other members of my family. It was more than just dinner. It was an experience.",

Well I'm here to tell you what a mistake! Very limited menu...my choice was the sausage with ziti (one piece of sausage) $26. My grandson doesn't eat much so he just had the salad that comes with a meal..$13.00. There was a total of 6 of us..everyone ordering to take the bill over $200 and they couldn't comp a small dinner salad???? The chicken parm was nasty...no flavor same with the shrimp alfredo.. no flavor. Creamed spinach was tasty. As far as my group is concerned it was not authentic italian and I would not go back! Been there, done that!",

He gave me some background story that the place used to be run and operated by the mafia and that the food was actually really good. My wife and I decided to go here for dinner and meet some of her friends that lived in the area they had never heard of the place once we got there we are very happy with the ambience and Amazed by the decoration and how every square inch of the place was covered with authentic stuff not manufactured or store-bought when we ordered the meals or very simple and the menu very clean and concise I decided to try the manicotti and my wife went with the muscles we are happily impressed that each meal came with a soup or salad you had two large bottles of both red and white wine your main course which had very large and feeling portions and a cappuccino to end the meal. I I went with the mix salad because I'm not a huge fan of minestrone soup. For a salad being a salad it was kind of boring however the manicotti was absolutely amazing. THE Filling was very flavorful and the sauce on top was simple yet went well with the entire meal. I sampled my wife's mussels and linguine and it also was very well seasoned and the flavor was amazing (sorry ma). If you're in town and with a party of two or more I highly recommend this if you like Italian food probably one of the top places I've ever eaten for Italian.",

The cheesecake dessert and the cappuccino was the perfect ending to the perfect meal. I could not have asked for more. Bravo battista's!!",

    "text": "This place pretends it's a locals joint, and not a tourist trap.  Even the name \"Hole in the Wall\" suggests that.  Note that actual \"hole in the wall\" restaurants don't name themselves as such.  Similar to how girls named \"HotChick6969\" in AOL chat rooms were rarely actually hot, or even chicks, for that matter.  Anything a block from the strip is not geared towards locals.  If you really want a locals experience, you have to get far enough from the strip to where you can't walk back without your legs hurting.  The food is mediocre.  Not horrible, but if you're expecting a solid, surprisingly good meal from a hidden Italian locals joint, you're going to be disappointed.  I remember when I came in and found out about the free wine.  My heart sank when I heard that.  I knew the wine would be terrible if it was free.  Indeed, it wasn't good.  I didn't even order a second glass.  I felt weird NOT drinking it, because it was included in the price.  Look, if you just want to visit for the accordions and the funky photos on the wall, have at it.  But just remember, someone set this place up in order to draw in dumb tourists walking down Flamingo, who think they're finding some hidden gem off the beaten path.  It's just not what it portrays itself to be, and I think that's what bothers me the most.",

The food was pretty awful, except the steak was really good for the price. The garlic bread was weird and lukewarm, we had no idea what the lump of fried carb stuff even was on the plate, and the wine was basically undrinkable.

The menu is limited and posted on boards on the wall.  You pretty much just pick whatever item you want and it comes with soup or salad, beverage including house wine, and a cappucino thing after dinner.  Most meals are about $22 and include everything I just mentioned, so pricewise its a good deal.  I've always found the food to be good but I usually just stick to the pasta dishes.  If you're a high maintenance or trendy type of person this is not the place for you - you'll be unhappy as soon as you walk in the door.  If you're laid back and like things a little retro or different then you'll really appreciate this place.",

The ambiance was nice, dim lighting, neat pictures hanging on the wall and things hanging on the ceiling. As soon as we sat they brought us red and white wine along with water. A min after we had a yummy salad & garlic bread. I ordered the manicotti (delicious) and bf ordered chicken parm (also amazing) all you can drink wine, a salad, garlic bread, cappuccino, and 2 entrees for $60 not bad at all.

First, if you are into tiny, artful dishes on equally beautiful plates then don't bother with Battista's.  This is hearty classic Italian like your mother might make.  The salad was wonderful and included with the meal.  We weren't offered a choice of dressing.  However, the house Italian was light and delicious.  The garlic bread was pretty standard.  The wine.  I can't say it was great but it went well with the meal.  It's free so you can stop your whining if you have issues and go to the nearest casino and pay $10 a glass if it makes you feel better.  I felt happy with the FREE unlimited wine provided.  Thank you.  The free cappuccino was the finishing touch.  Very nice.  This being said, we paid just a bit more for our meal at Battista's than the meal last night in the food court and it put that sub to shame!",

It has a wide range of options for a decent price, and you received garlic bread, a soup or salad, unlimited red or white house wine, cappuccino, a pasta side, and your main. My friends and I had the soup and garlic bread, which were both delicious. We were also very impressed with the house wine, which wasn't too dry. We also tried the linguini with clams, the spaghetti with meatballs, and the pomodoro. All were very good, and we couldn't even eat half of our portions. Also, I highly recommend that you try the cappuccino even if you are full. It was probably the best cappuccino I've ever had.",

RESERVATIONS - yes you need them but why bother ?? We had reservations for 4 at 8:30 pm and didn't get seated until 9:10 pm.  HOSTESSES - hope you like to be treated like a first grader. Told the girl our whole party was present and she proceeded to say let me know when your whole party arrives !! What ??  FOOD - I'm either a food snob, enjoy my own cooking or know why I don't frequent Olive Garden either. This food is below sub par. Truthfully. We sent 2 of the 4 dinners back. Linguine with canned clam sauce ?? We were told they ran out of whole clams ! And you decided that canned clams were acceptable rather than having us make a different food choice ?? Ok ... What about the steak pizzaole ?? Is the steak suppose to be tough (NO !) and is the marinara sauce suppose to be tasteless ?? NO !!! Send it back !! CAPPUCCINO - really ?? Powdered cappuccino with whipped cream ?? Who puts whipped cream in cappuccino ??? Probably those first graders I referred to earlier.   If you want a great authentic Italian meal (yes I'm Italian and yes my son is a chef) ... SKIP THIS RESTAURANT !!!!!! Awful",

    "text": "I would give this place 5 stars, but the idiot hostess was so terrible that I knocked it down to 3 stars. First I called to make a reservation. She said she had a reservation available at 6:00; I said great. She hung up on me without getting my name. So I called back and got the same gal. This time she said they don't take reservations for the next 30 minutes (it was 5:20), but she didn't have anything until 7:30 anyway and we should just walk in. I asked how long the wait was: 15 minutes. So we showed up; same girl said she could take us right away. So we started to follow her partner who started walking towards the dining room and the hostess says no, it's going to be 20 minutes. \"But you JUST said you could take us right away.\" \"Yeah, but I don't have a table.\" WTH?!?!?  When we were seated she failed to give us menus. Once the service was handed off to the waiter, however, things improved considerably. Food was great, waiter was great. Prices seem high until you account for the fact that wine is included. Cappuccino too!  Edited: I returned to Battista's on a subsequent trip to Las Vegas and had a thoroughly pleasant experience.  They even gave me my cappuccino to go since I had to meet someone after dinner.  Upgrading my rating to 4 stars.",

I did not like looking at menus on the wall, nor did I like having my meal as a package deal. I don't drink wine. I can't eat 10 pounds of food.  If you like wine and can eat a lot, this is a pretty fairly priced option.  In any case, I had the minestrone with my meal which was pretty ordinary. Tasted a bit like it came out of a can. For my entree, I had the veal parm. Again, it was pretty ordinary. The veal wasn't particularly tender. The \"cappuccino\" at the end of the meal wasn't cappuccino. It really tasted like some sugary powdered coffee-like drink.  Our waitress was unattentive and slow. Took forever to get anything.  All in all, I would skip this place. There are so many better options.",

When we asked the waiter why we did not get them, he answered that ONLY those that order a steak plate ($40) are getting them.  The cappuccino was not an espresso drink but hot chocolate with whip cream.  The food was okay but not worth the price. The waiter was too busy to give us quality time and care.",

Reservations are important, but you can get one same day if you need to.  We got there a few minutes early and were seated right on time for our reservation.  The first thing they did was put a big bottle of wine on our table and say that we could have all we could drink of it (yay!).  The menu is pretty simple, different kinds of delicious italian food separated by price range (about $21-30 a plate, including soup/salad, wine, garlic bread, and meal).  The garlic bread was delicious and the wine was decent (but free, and for some reason I liked it more and more as the night progressed...).  The salad was a pretty average italian salad, but the lasagna was wonderful (although by that point I had quite a bit of wine in me, but I think it would have been great anyway).  So I would definitely recommend this place, I found myself disappointed when I was full because there was plenty of food left on my plate and I wished there was room for more of it in my stomach.  It was a night ender though because my friend and I were both completely trashed from all the free wine by the end of the meal.",

It's definitely worth the price and you won't be surprised by how much your meal costs in the end. The menu is cut and dry. Pick an entree off the list and order soup or salad with it. They'll bring you garlic bread and unlimited house wine along with a side of pasta with your meal. The wine is probably from a box, but it's very drinkable and goes down smooth. Where else in Vegas can you get such a deal? The menu has staples like lasagna and veal parmigiana. It's basic, but very hearty and filling. The servers have it down to a science. These kind of family-run businesses are a rarity. There's a funny accordion player that will work his way to your table. Tip the old guy as he is very charming! I like the vibe of Battista's and I will definitely be back. It's the kind of place to take an old friend, but not a work client you want to impress. My boyfriend and I appreciate kitsch, so it worked for us! We used a coupon and got $10 off $50 or more, so our meal was more than affordable. I just can't believe they made a big deal out of the coupon being on a smart phone instead of printed out when it says on the coupon that you can just show the server your phone. Weird...I hate being hassled, but ultimately they granted the $10 off, so no harm done.   I'm just sorry it took me this long to finally eat here. I will be back for the one-of-a-kind ambiance and experience.",

I am a local looking for favorite little places to put on a 'go to' list when I want a night off the Strip. ATMOSPHERE: Great, Old Vegas Feel....had me with eager hopes for good food to match....SIGH.... SERVICE: average - with many 'points to the MENU on the wall'. FOOD: Ok, the menu on the wall brags of 'Free wine (white or red)', 'free soup or salad', 'free garlic bread', 'free sugar/syrup cappuccino' -ALL of this \"free with your meal\".   The Lowest meal is $21.00 --this for a plate of pasta, sauce and two hard little meatballs.  Humm,  think we are really paying for all this crap.  I'm blonde but not stupid. OK, IF the food was GOOD-I would pay twice the price for all that 'free stuff'.  But, I think I could get better pasta at one of the cheapest Buffets in town.  The spaghetti and meatball dinner was bad, but the eggplant parm was like a Banquet frozen dinner and I think $24.  hahaha   How do you spell RAGU?   The wine is watered down cheap red, which I expected. The garlic bread, was not toasted, but warm and dried out like it sat around in the oven and turned to hard crumbs. Soup, canned.  Salad, blah.  I am  totally shocked to see the high stars and great ratings for food.  I guess pasta lovers ...just plain love pasta, no matter how crappy? Another place X'd off my 'restaurants to try list'.",

Just look at the pictures on the walls of all the celebrities that have been there over the decades. I can't believe I never knew about this place the whole time I lived in Vegas. But I'm glad I finally tried it, it's so great. I love the old school set menu of entree, garlic bread, soup or salad, pasta, and wine. And not just a glass of wine, a carafe! Great Italian food and right off the heart of the Las Vegas strip. You got to try this legendary place.",

    "text": "Fool me once, Battista's, shame on you. Fool me twice....  I originally went to Battista's around 2006, when I first moved to Vegas and had heard about how it was this awesome old Italian joint. Ok, checked it out. But the food sucked. I'm no chef, and I remember walking out of there thinking, \"I could have made better ravioli than that! And it wasn't even cheap!\" I vowed never to go back.  Fast forward to 2015. I read a glowing review of Battista's from Rick Moonen in the LV Weekly, and thought, \"maybe they've changed the food!\" We were in the area a couple weeks ago and decided to return, give it another chance.  The inside still has that cool mob hangout feel and there's an old guy walking around playing an accordion. That's why they get the 2nd star.  Overview for those who haven't been: everybody orders a \"dinner\" which comes with entree, soup or salad, garlic bread, unlimited house wine, and coffee. If you choose not to order an entree, you still have to pay for a dinner: $19 since you could be cheating and drinking out of somebody else's baby wine glass of $3 wine (what they serve is on par with 2 buck chuck, no question).  I wouldn't even care about the weird setup if the food was actually good. The salad (a handful of lettuce with a piece of salami and shredded carrots on top) came out about the time the words \"I'll have the salad\" were coming out of my mouth. Soup was fine for minestrone. Where they really failed was the entree. I asked the waiter what was their signature dish, but he seemed baffled by the question, and instead asked, \"you mean something you can't get anywhere else? That's the chicken rio.\" Ok fine, I'll take the chicken rio. It's chicken and pasta in a white sauce. Only the chicken is blobby and the white sauce isn't really sauce. More like straight heavy cream they poured on the plate. It seriously has no taste, just a fatty consistency.   My original review stands: I could make better Italian food at home. Or purchase it at Fresh & Easy and heat it up. And it would be 10 times better. I honestly think they paid Rick Moonen to write that review. Or maybe he got some special food?   Insult to injury: this meal cost me over $30!",

Reminds me of the rainbow room in California. Every meal comes with wine which is kind of neat except when your party of 4 includes two kids. If our party was all adults it would have been more worthwhile. This is the reason it gets three stars. If it were the food alone it would probably just get two. We paid $44 for 2 plates of spaghetti with butter? Damn! The sausage cacciatore was good not great but not bad just good. Same with the chicken parmigiana. Good not great not bad just good.

    "text": "If you want something a little low key and inexpensive, for dinner, in Vegas, try what looks to me like the original Buca Di Beppo.  The bar was nice, but not fancy. We did not have a reservation, so it was really nice to sit, at the bar, and have a drink while we waited, for a table.  I guess since we didn't have a reservation, we got the booth we got; in the corner kind of squeezed behind a booth, and next to a table.  But, that was fine, since we didn't have to get up too much, since there was no way not to knock into the woman's chair closest, to us.  The service was friendly.  They have complimentary house wine, which is a very nice touch. If you are picky I am sure you can buy a bottle, as well.  There was complimentary garlic bread, too.  The house salad was really nice.  The Chicken Parmesan was good, but the spinach was incredible. I could have eaten a huge bowl! There was also a side of pasta.  The Spumoni dessert was different than I had ever seen. It was like a slice of cake. It was much too cold, and hard. I would have liked it better, if it had sat out for  about 20 minutes. I love Angelo  Brocato's Spumoni, in New Orleans, so I was comparing.  But, the star of the meal (dare I say, even better than the spinach) was the complimentary cappuccino. It was out of this world.  I am glad we went and it was nice, because it was a short walk, from our hotel.",

I ordered the cannelloni because it's a dish often served for special occasions. The dish arrives decorated in the green white and red colors of the Italian flag and thoroughly heated through.   The amount of salt in this dish was off the charts!  Two forkfuls into it I was reaching for the water.  When the server came back to ask how everything was i stated that I didn't like my dish because of the salt.   She just said \"okay I'll tell them\" and walked away.  No offer to replace the dish and at the end no offer to remove any part of the dish off the bill.    I will not return to this place nor do I recommend this place.  Stay away!",

The chicken rio was bland and served with way too much cheese attempting to cover up the lack of flavor.  My NY steak was overcooked and the knife was terribly dull to the point that I could not cut the steak.  Very disappointed!

Capped off the meal with a delicious cappuccino that also comes with your meal.",

Until today I was willing to forgive and forget but then I saw in the photos here on yelp that nothing has changed since then!  Where the hell WERE you back then, yelp?  THOUSANDS from around the world could've been warned at least 23 years earlier.  Especially me.  Came here with a party of 12 and the service was ok.  One person asked if the broiled salmon was fresh or frozen.  \"FRESH!\" the waitress replied enthusiastically.  It was frozen.  Every item on the menu came either out of a can or out of a freezer.  Pasta was boiled ahead of time and reheated.  EVERYTHING was greasy, running with butter and/or margarine.  As you can imagine, the wine was the cheapest jug p!ss money can buy.  Even the garlic bread was foul.  How can you ruin GARLIC BREAD?!!!  It didn't even offer much to entertain us at the level of kitsch.  COWBOY-Italian decor would best describe it.  COWBOY-Italian?  I am of Italian descent and was very offended that they had the nerve to call this Italian food.  I could have understood better perhaps if it was still 1973 and Nixon was still in office.  It wasn't even cheap.  Frankly, you couldn't PAY me to eat this slop but I suspect that hordes of tourists from China and American flyover country will keep them in business for many years to come, putting ketchup on their chicken parm and drinking their powdered instant cappuccino with whipped cream.  The way I see it, you can either join them or live.  'Nuff said.",

The plates we received were not exactly what we ordered.  OK, perhaps the wait staff is overworked and missed a detail (twice) - easy to do if you don't write down the order.  The garlic bread was embarrassing - too much garlic and so drenched with something (oil or butter?) that it could't possibly toast well.  Garlic bread should have a slight hint of a taste of garlic, not be a weapon of mass Dracula destruction.  The green salad was drowned in dressing.  The pasta came sticky, an indication that it wasn't freshly prepared but had been sitting around a while.  The red sauce tasted no better than cheap jar sauce you can buy at any grocery stores.  The sausage had no taste.  The veal piccante (piccata) had no taste.  The red house wine is truly pathetic.    In Italy, this restaurant would be run out of town!  In fact, I'll go as far as saying that Italian stray dogs would turn their noses and run -  the absolute worst food experience EVER!  Just in case I wasn't clear enough, we were extremely disappointed and much poorer for the experience.  If you want better Italian food (and cheaper), Uber yourself away from the Strip.",

    "text": "I can honestly say this was the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life. And I don't even have high standards. All I need is mildly decent service and pretty good, inexpensive food. This place didn't even come close to that. It was seriously laughable.   For starters, there isn't a normal menu. It's this weird small menu stuck to the wall that is crazy overpriced and the food wasn't even mildly decent to justify it. You have to order an entree dish and it comes with garlic bread, soup or salad, some pasta dish, a coffee, and a complimentary glass of red or white wine. No a la carte or appetizers possible.   Our waiter was the most socially awkward person ever. He didn't make eye contact and would walk away from our table as we were placing our orders. We would start talking to him and he'd start walking away from the table every time mid-conversation like he had somewhere else really important to be and he couldn't be bothered with us.  I kind of feel like we were on the show boiling point from MTV. We kept expecting someone to pop out with a camera telling us it was all a huge joke. It was that uncomfortable. When we finally got our food, our waiter forgot our complimentary wine and when we asked if he was going to bring it he stared aimlessly over our heads and responded saying yeah, like he was really confused and then finally brought it over. We also asked for bottled water and he brought us a carafe of tap water when we specifically asked for bottled water.  Also, even if you aren't eating, if you have a bite of someone else's food they charge you $13.... Wtf is that?  There was a 70 year old man who came to each table serenading you with his accordion hoping for a tip which was just so sad and awkward. It made us feel so uncomfortable especially when he finished and none of us had cash. So weird. We just wanted to eat real quick, no serenade needed. The food was nothing special either. My boyfriend ordered the meatball dish and asked our waiter to have his meatballs cut into smaller pieces and they came in full form. So clearly the waiter didn't listen to his request at all. Also, we never received any side pasta dish like the menu said you would get with your entree. (Not like we wanted it anyways with how horrible the food quality was). But still, you expect to get what you pay for.   All in all this place had horrible food, extremely unprofessional staff and made us very uncomfortable. Do yourself a solid and go elsewhere.",

Once seated the waiter, brought us wine and garlic bread. The bread was excellent, the red wine just \"meh\" (not great, not horrible). Wife had Eggplant Parmesan and I had the Lasagna. Both were served in a nice portion, fresh out of the over, and were tasty! We really enjoyed them but couldn't eat it all (We are looking forward to lunch today with the left overs!). Our only distraction at Battista's was the speed of the waiters; they are working so hard to get folks in and out they move like the wind! They provided great service, but we got tired just watching their frenetic pace! We highly recommend Battista's and we will go here again on our next visit!",

I've lived out here five years and heard this place was a legend. Maybe once it was a good place to eat but you really gotta hate money and food to go here. Overpriced. Tasted like tv dinner but worse. Can't stress how bad it is. \"Cappicuino\" is actually some powdered sugar coffee drink like nescafe with whip cream. The bring like 20 on a cart and just let them sit until people are done eating. Salad had sliced up lunch meat, flavorless shredded cheese and some sour dressing.  Meal took turn for the worse when a scary old man the size of a child with accordion comes uncomfortably close to us, party of three. Says creepily \"I have the perfect song for 3 guys.\" Proceeds to play \"take me out to the ball game\" and replaces the word peanuts with penis. Super weird. Just not the right time at all for that kind of humor. Wanted to leave right there. Should have; we were there to eat not have some creepy old dude talk about penis while we eat. I am not offended by it specifically it's just in really poor taste. Kids within earshot. He made sure to get really close in to our space when he said penis; as if we didn't get it.  He ends the song obviously expecting a tip. Says \"thank you guys so much\" three or four times but in an insincere way. I have a tip; stop making sexually awkward jokes like that with strangers in your place of business so they don't out you on the internet. I have seen other posters say he is the owner.   If so you're put on notice; your restaurant sucks. Your food sucks. You suck. Your wait staff is solid; that's about it. Didn't even try your garbage wine. Your restaurant is selling nostalgia and a lot of crap on the walls.   Hostess and server were both attentive and polite. Swear they both knew the food was crap and were embarrassed for us. Fat tip left for staff. Other than that please do not support this business. They are ripping people off with their low quality food and that old guy is a creep.    I'll never understand all these positive reviews. Spend the $$ and go to maggiano's. Or just go the grocery store and get some Stouffer's. Both are better options especially since you won't have some strange old goon pretending to play the accordion and making bad jokes while you eat.   Just can't possibly imagine how low someone's standards have to be to give this place a positive food review. It's terrible especially at the price point of about  minimum of 40 per person after tip. Really some of the worst food I have ever eaten in my life. Could not finish anything served from the salad to the \"cappicuino.\"  Anyone giving this 5 stars for food quality is either lying for some reason or is absolutely unqualified to judge the quality of food. Just absolutely shocking to me than anyone with $40 dollars to spend on dinner could possibly find this acceptable. It's terrible. Do not go here.",

So, we order the chicken parm and spaghetti with meatballs. It comes out and my chicken is dry and sauce tastes like they put all the garlic they could find in it so they could cover the can taste. My bfs  meatball was  ice cold in the middle. We both ate about 2 bites then stopped eating and waited for our server.   And we waited...    And we waited ...  And we waited...  Finally 15 mins later he comes over and brings the check. Didn't even notice that we didn't eat our food until I spoke up and asked for a manager.  He got kind of insulted when I said we had been there multiple times  before and have never had such a bad experience. He got loud and said \"Oh so what, the food is just horrible?!\" So I responded \"well I wouldn't say it that way.. but yes\".   He scoops our $100 off the table with the check then comes back 5 mins later and says \"The manager took off your entrees but charged you the cover charge of $13 each. So you got more than half off.\" Throws down the change and walks away.   No apology from the server and Manager never even came over.   We paid $28 (after tax) for food we didn't eat. Which comes down to us basically paying $28 for water and bread since we don't drink alcohol so we don't drink the \"free wine\"",

It was awful and for the price I was just bewildered how this establishment is still around. My wife couldn't finish her food (Seafood Pasta) and my friend made negative comments about his dish.

We took a large group there and they took wonderful care of us.  If you are seeking fancy dining, linen tablecloths and classical music playing...this is not the place.  It is noisy, tables are close together, and menus are on the wall.  We loved the atmosphere and cheesiness of the place.  The prices aren't awful but the food was spot on.  Ate at the Pasta Pirate downtown earlier in the week and this place blows it away.  You won't be disappointed if your expectations are realistic.",

That may seem high, but you get unlimited wine, unlimited bread, your choice of salad or minestrone soup, your entree and a cappuccino. Each meal is pretty large so when we go with 3, we order 2 meals and pay a $13 cover charge. But keep in mind, the extra $13 gets you wine, bread, soup or salad and a cappuccino. I don't understand why people here complain about the wine; they have other options available, so if you're that \"high class,\" then you should be able to pay for your own good wine. This is an awesome flashback to the era of the RatPack. Our absolute favorite is the chicken alfredo. If you're coming for \"high-class wine,\" don't come here. If you're coming for the experience, drinkable wine, and good food, this is your place. They have an accordion player, Gordy, that has been playing here since 1981; He is AWESOME! He makes you feel at home and like he knows you. Overall, this place is a must do in Vegas.",

We were staying at the Flamingo and could see Battista's from our hotel window, and considered it a sign!  Besides, Yelp seems to like this place, and I always trust my fellow Yelpers.   Yelp, I owe you one.  This was a great find!  My husband and I both had bowls of pasta which were delicious.  I had spaghetti with marinara while my hubby had ziti with a spicier red sauce.  Both were amazing, and really hit the spot!   Also, every dinner comes with buttery garlic bread, a salad, and unlimited wine.  Yes, you heard that right - UNLIMITED.  Amazing.   The decor is classic Italian meets Vegas for sure.  There are lots of autographed pictures of older celebrities, a giant collection of miniature liquors, plus just about everything else you can imagine.  It's very interesting and entertaining.    Bottom line is:  I came here with a hangover, and left with a full belly and feeling a little tipsy.  That's what I call a win!",

I grew up on Italian, home-cooked food, I've spent a month in Italy and literally ate my way through the country, and have an eleven-letter Italian last name that people constantly butcher when they try to pronounce it.  It is that experience that prompted me to sign up for Yelp and give Battista's its deserved one star. It was dismal.   The main reason I am writing this is to dispel myths circling around (from LOCALS no less) that this place is fun and has good Italian food. Neither is True. Though our wait staff was attentive and prompt, the good service we got just didn't outweigh the bad food.   The decor is kitschy - crap all over the place. The food pricing is way too expensive for iceberg salad, adequate garlic bread and mediocre wine. I ordered a chicken dish and had minestrone. They were both way too salty (a trick used by restaurants to hide poor quality or good-tasting food). And yes, the accordion player was awkward to say the least.   Over-priced, overrated and a tourist trap with a miraculously good reputation. My advice? Go to Maggiano's for GREAT Italian food. Or Olive Garden. Or Buca di Beppo's even.  Just please, don't go here. Don't perpetuate the Battista's myth.",

Then when one person at the table found a long hair in her food, the plate was taken away by the waiter that we had to request to see three times.

You could spend hours looking at all the photos plastered all over the wall of famous and semi-famous people that ate there throughout the years.  The atmosphere is sort of romantic and casual depending on where they seat you.  The menu is on every wall and is all inclusive.  So what ever meal you order ($21-$45) it includes soup or salad, garlic bread, entree, cappuccino and all the free wine you can drink (red/white).  One word of caution on the wine if you love and know good wines, this stuff is not that.  It is the cheapest stuff you'll ever choke down.  I've have the veal in the past and the spaghetti with sausage which are ok at best.  I've spent a lot less and had much better food at other places like The Olive Garden.

We went this past Monday at 5:30 - not exactly what I would call a busy time. We had bread, salad, and food within 30 minutes, so we were feeling very rushed. I wasn't even halfway through my entree when the server was already coming by asking if we wanted cappuccino. The food was sub-par, nothing to write home about (the salad was DRENCHED in dressing and inedible). They gave us two carafes of wine - one white, one red. There were 5 of us, and we were never offered any more. From seating to signing the bill was exactly 1 hour. We asked our server Gerson for another carafe as we still had quite some time to kill before our show. His response was, \"I can absolutely give you more wine; however I need this table so you will need to drink this in the lounge.\" I have NEVER in my life been asked to get up from a table, ESPECIALLY after only one hour. We were absolutely appalled, and this will probably keep me from going there in the future.",

I'm not sure if that had anything to do with them closing a section of the place, but it was still busy in the section we ate.  Salad was odd but good; main course not so much.  Decor was old Vegas which was nice.  Wine and coffee is included in meal.  Overall, OK to eat at once but wouldn't go back again.",

    "text": "Battista's is awesome.  You can find higher quality Italian food out there, but the food is still better than most, especially better than your generic crap like Buca di Beppo.    Battista's is all about its convenient location to the Strip and all the stuff you get with your meal.  Your entree comes with a soup or salad, cappucino, garlic bread and UNLIMITED wine!  The cappucino is delicious in my opinion, a great way to end the meal.    I've had the spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parm and ziti w meat sauce.  I will recommend that you stick with the meatballs / meat sauce.  The chicken parm is not worth the extra 5 bucks or whatever.  It is good but not high tier for chicken parms.  The meat sauce is definitely above average, along with the meatballs.  Some people here say it is too expensive.  Sure, I can go down to South Las Vegas and get unlimited wine and beer from Studio B at the M Resort, but Battista's gets you filled up and full of wine 1 minute from the strip.  It is right behind the Flamingo.    I milk it a bit, take a while to order while I enjoy the wine.  I get my money's worth.  Accordion player comes around to serenade you and your hot date.    Overall, I agree with the majority of posts here, the food is good, not the best, but solid.  You get a bang for your buck.  My advice is to stick to the cheaper options for a value play on Vegas.",

I had a family emergency and I had to leave town and I purchased a Groupon for the $40 for the $25 purchased. My coupon literally expires the day that I fly back in to town. I was told by one of the assistant managers to ask for Doug the general manager because he's very good at approving coupons especially for brand new customers and upon calling them today the inflection in his voice and the way he handled the phone call was very arrogant and very careless and did not seem to care that I would not only lose money on my coupon but also the fact that I was a new customer and would rather argue then make an exception even after I was told he is good at these things and has no issues whatsoever but apparently he does not care about customers especially new ones. I always thought the customer was right but I guess I thought wrong. As long as Doug is managing Battista's Hole in the Wall, I will never evem consider to patron and I'll be sure to let other people know just the same. Such a shame!",

We were seated once our entire group arrived, which was a tad annoying that we had to wait for everyone, but it is understandable.  Everyone's order was correct.  No one made a face about having to deal with such a large group. Service was fast and friendly.   They won't split the check on huge groups, but we managed to all chip in enough to cover the bill in one go.    Vegetarians can get the usual Italian stuff - manicotti, ravioli, pasta with marinara.  All meals come with soup or salad, garlic bread, a side of pasta (if you don't get pasta as your meal), cappuccino, and most importantly - free house wine (and yes they bring refills)!  Plan on $25-40/person depending on how nuts you want to get.  The garlic bread is a particular winner.",

    "text": "This place is so over rated, it's not even funny.    First of all, way to expensive. 20 plus dollars for everything. Any type of pasta dish is over 20 bucks.    Secondly the food. I ordered the veal parma. It was not fresh, it tasted frozen and reheated. Not mention it was over thirty dollars. They serve it with a side of some green stuff I couldn't make out what is was. Maybe spinach. Tasted like dirt. It also came with a side of pasta. Under cooked. I tried my wives pasta, it to was under cooked.    It's a bottomless house wine place. I think the price of this place is trying to make up for this free house wine.   I was celebrating my return to work and my wife's vacation. A friend of mine joined us. He has been here at this restaurant fifteen years ago. He warned us it isn't all that. I never have been here before.I should of took his advise and went to my favorite Italian restaurant down the street. Bucca di Beppo (it would of been a lot cheaper also). Did I mention I know the ex-chef. I'll be sending him a personal note also.  The other reviews I have read talks a lot about the ambience. It seemed old. It looked like it needed a good cleaning threw out the dinning area. I didn't feel like home. I'm Italian and this is not 'authentic' italian food. I know authentic and the difference of re-heated.   All in all I will not be returning to this place ever....",

    "text": "Ok...I see the reviews that talk about long waits, high prices, poor wine and poor food....but honestly..my wife and I loved this place!    Everyone has to rate it on their own experience and let me tell you about ours...it was the highlight of our food experiences while in Vegas!  We had NO wait...we came early (5pm) by Vegas standards since we were meeting friends later..and although it filled up quickly, we were seated immediately.  Hint: go early.  Solid value...Not sure if bad reviews about price are from folks that frequent McDonald's, but I thought price was fine.  We spent more money at a couple casino food courts that had absolutely horrible food....and spent 4 x the price at a steak house that, although good, did not satisfy us like batistas.    Food and wine were super!  I am not much for wine...my wife is a good bit more discerning in this area...but we both enjoyed the complimentary red and white.  If you have to have high end stuff...buy it...but batistas version is fine and heck, it costs the same amount to have a sip or to have multiple carafs...we chose the latter approach and enjoyed a bunch of red and white...and it tasted better with every sip.  As for the food...we come from a solid Italian community with lots of good home grown restaurants that make olive garden seem inadequate...and we really enjoyed our food at batistas.  I had veal, my wife had some type of shrimp dish... we had a good bit of it before the wine clouded our judgement, and it was well prepared, large portions, and very tasty.    So....GO!   You'll love the atmosphere...the pictures, the dark, the small cut up rooms, the garlic bread, the wine, the food, the value, the desert cappacino, and the little ol guy....we will definitely be back!",

It's an \"italian family style\" type place, though the particular style of Battista's marks it as a uniquely Vegas location.  The menu is on the wall- 15 choices ranging from spaghetti to \"Steak Caruso\".  Free white and red wine is included with the meal.  The portions are enormous.  My veal parmesan was terrible, but I was expecting the food to be terrible, so it wasn't that big a deal.  The free cappucinio that came with the meal was hot chocolate?  Why don't they just put it on the menu like that?  The cheesy decor is fun.",

It is not in a casino, but is located by a mini-mart. Reservations are recommended and it is only open for dinner (4:00 - 10:00). All meals include garlic bread, soup or salad, all the wine you can drink (house wine red or white only) and a cappuccino. We had the lasagna and chicken parmesan, which came with a side of pasta. Complete meals range from $20 to $40. A little old Italian guy goes from table to table and plays his accordion for tips.  The food was OK, nothing great. The wine was not good, but it was free. The garlic bread was great and the cappuccino was excellent (and I don't like coffee).",

The accordion player is a real delight as well.  Overall-- fantastic!

I had the broiled catch of the day (Salmon that day), and while the cut of fish was good, the glaze was meh, and the side vegetables were bordering on mushy.   I tried some of the included pasta that was being passed around our massive table of 20+ folks, and it was also meh. I tend to judge italian places by the quality of their marinara, and I wasn't impressed - it was flat tasting and didn't seem particularly fresh.  The redeeming qualities of this place are the all-italian, make you feel like you're in Brooklyn staff, and the unlimited house wine (which was surprisingly OK).   The accordion player was so genuinely happy to be there and playing his accordion for us, and I'd say he was the highlight of my night.   With all of the similarly priced yet exceptional food in Vegas, it's hard to say that I would make an effort to come back, but it was nice for a single visit.",

The salad didn't appear fresh and was served so quickly that they had to be mass produced and sitting around in the kitchen.  The meatballs were good, but the sausage was lacking in taste.  We had ravioli and spaghetti as well, I can't believe how bad the sauce was....bitter and tasteless.  There has to be better Italian food in Vegas....and I'll be searching for it next visit.",

It's kind of dirty, but its not a big issue unless if you are planning to eat in the lot.  Ambiance (1/5): Light is very dark. When I walked into the restaurant, I felt like a navy seal trying to break into Binladen's compound using night vision goggles. They seriously need to lighten up this joint. Noise level is average for your average Italian restaurant.  Service (2/5): I had reserved a table for 4 and we were sited immediately when our full party arrived. I would recommend reserving a table ahead of time, especially on weekend. The server was very good, he got us the wine and garlic bread right after we ordered and he wasn't annoying like other places where waiters keep bothering you to see how you are doing. Also, avoid the musician whom goes from table to table literally playing nothing but a small tune and you feel obligated to give him money.   Food (4/5): Food is pretty good.  Meals range from $23-45 and they courses contain salad/soup, garlic bread, house wine (red/white), entree, and a cappuccino. I ordered salad, which was good; it wasn't drenched in dressing like many other places. House wine is all you can drink, but you get what you pay for.  Garlic bread was pretty good. It wasn't overly laced with garlic butter, so it complemented well with the main entree. My main entree was sausage with penne and meat sauce. Meat sauce was delicious, not to sour, and just the right amount of sweetness. The spicy sausage was amazing in flavor and it was cooked to perfection. The best part of the meal was cappuccino, which comes with all meals and it was one of the best post meal hot-dessert I've ever had.   Overall (3/5), it's a decent off the strip joint. The prices are very reasonable for good meals, but the ambiance and service does need some work.",

    "text": "Batista's was recommended to my husband and myself by a coworker and I wish we hadn't heeded her suggestion...  The ambiance in the place was cluttered and cloistering.   I get what they are going for, an obviously have been working on it forever, but the place could really use a sprucing up after all these years...  There are no menus they are just plastered on the walls ...EVERY wall. Entrees run $28 to $38 dollars and include free house wine (which should be a trigger) soup or salad, garlic bread, a pasta side if your entee does not include pasta, and a cup of cappuccino.  Maybe I'm a food snob, but this place needs Kitchen Nightmares called on it!  To start with, the free house wine tasted like grape juice and vinegar and was completely undrinkable. The salad was served overdressed in Italian dressing, which made the lettuce soggy.  This was the oddest salad I'd ever been served.  It included a single black olive, a single grape tomato, one whole pepperoncini, sliced carrots, a huge slice of salami, and a big chunk of cheese.  The \"garlic\" bread did not taste of garlic at all. It just tasted like Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning on really greasy bad bread.  My husband ordered the shrimp scampi and he said that the shrimp was pretty good but the rest was just average. I ordered the chicken parmesan. The pasta side dish with cooked fine and the sauce was not bad. The chicken was cooked properly but the giant hunk of melted mozzarella did nothing to cover up the fact that the breading on the chicken soggy and tasteless.   The topper was the side of creamed spinach... call 1973 they want their side dish back!  Our water was served in plastic cafeteria cups and the cup of cappuccino at the end of the meal was served in a plastic mug.  It tasted like powdered cappuccino mix, but was honestly probably the best part of the meal!  I would give Battista's 1 star for the food but the service was not bad so I'm giving them 2.  What we thought might be a rare gem off the strip turned out to be nothing to write home about...  Don't bother wandering off to a bad part of town looking for good food... stay in your hotel.. there's bound to be better food there!",

We also got soup or salad, amazing garlic bread, our entree and cappachino with our meal! Everything was excellent! It was all for about $25 a person.  Also a cute old guy came over and played the accordion and sang an individualized song to each table!   Go there and you won't be sorry. :)",

Which is ok because you get an extra salad, bread, cappuccino and of course wine. All the food was fair. Nothing great nothing bad. Atmosphere was old school Italian,  very inviting.  Menus were on the wall.  You get red and/or white a bottle of wine on your table. Cappuccino was definitely Americanized,  very sweet with whipped cream on top. Good but not Italian (breakfast drink in Italy). Accordion player worked a tip out of us. Pretty old guy, didn't really play well but was nice. I would go back for atmosphere and wine.",

We decided to make reservations for our last night in Las Vegas. He was spot on in his recommendation. It was a good thing we made reservations as they were solidly booked and had people waiting. The interior walls are filled with pictures of famous people, some signed and some not. Menu was  on a board by the table. Included in the meal is garlic bread(fantastic), soup or salad, white and/or red wine(a carafe of each), the main entree and a cappuccino at the end. Portions were enormous, but authentic. We were so glad we checked it out. I think it will be one of our must dos when we visit Vegas!",

To keep it simple, the food is amazing, the prices are right, and the service is excellent. We stepped in, as it was a minute walk from our hotel, and we were all glad we did. As a family of five and knowing their portions were large we got three dinners and passed them around. The lasagna, ravioli, and sausage and peppers were all delicious. Along with the meal you get bottomless red and white wine, salad or soup, and homemade cappuccinos.  The environment is very homey and the service topped it off to make the experience memorable. If you're in the mood for some traditional Italian food, I would definitely recommend you check out this hole in the wall.",

I had a Groupon and figured we would give this place a try. It wasn't worth the $100+ (before groupon was applied) for a party of 4 and a baby.   The unlimited wine was absolutely nasty, the red as well as the white. The garlic bread was greasy and don't get me started on the cappuccino that was just a water down sugary instant coffee mix of some sort...  Now for the main dish. I had the veal parmigiano. It was really big but a bit soggy and the breading was thicker than the meat itself. The side dish of pasta marinara was so small my 21 month old son ended eating all of it as well my husband's and still wanted more. At least he enjoyed it, but I couldn't tell you how they were cooked since I didn't have not one bite, that's how small it was...  I'm very disappointed and would not go back there again! Spend your money on the Strip or even at Buca di Beppo right down the street. I would give this place a big fat 0 star if I could... just sad food",

    "text": "I read several reviews before coming here. I was a little apprehensive due to some of the negative comments but one of the girls I was traveling with kept raving about the place and wanted to stop by.   I have to preface this with the fact that I wasn't expecting much since my expectations were so low it wasn't hard to exceed them.   I thought the food was great! I had the fettucino alfredo and it was decent, flavorful and fresh. Was it the best alfredo? No. Was it good, yes.   This place is more about the ambiance and history. It's an all inclusive price for each meal (ranging from $22 - $40). My dish included all you can drink red and white wine. The red wine was \"meh\" but it was free so no complaints here. Not a fan of white wine so I didn't really enjoy it.   The salad was surprisingly simple and tasty. The garlic bread was fresh and tasted great. The after dinner cappuccino wasn't very good, super sweet and luke warm.   All in all, I would recommend this place especially if you're with a group of people. If you want an amazing, fancy dinner this isn't your place. If you want to experience a local eatery with a lot of charm and decent food, then this is your place. Keep in mind that the dinner is somewhat pricey but you get a ton of food!   As they promised - it's a \"hole in the wall\" and they delivered.",

The portions were great and everything tastes awesome.  I had the veal parmigiana and my wife had the chicken parmigiana. I had the salad and my wife had the soup. Both came with garlic bread, house wine, a side of pasta and a capacino. I didn't realize it came with the side of pasta and wanted to order a side of spaghetti, so I was really happy that it came with the meal.  Both dishes and all of the sides tasted great. I don't like wine, but my wife said it was pretty good. Kind of about what you'd expect for a house wine that is included with your meal.  The side to the main course was spinach. I personally don't like spinach, but I did try it. It had good flavors, but I couldn't get past the texture. My wife thought it was good though.  Overall, I was very impressed with Battista's and would happily go back again and will be sure to tell my friends to go there.",

Got sat, and was greeted about five minutes later. Water and drinks were brought by ten minutes later. Unlimited red and white wine that my companion liked. The tables are placed in such a manner that you are very intimate with other tables. Garlic bread was brought out and it was delicious. Some of the best I've ever had. I ordered minestrone and the lobster raviolli, and my companion ordered eggplant parm. Both were very good, even though I felt my portion was a little small. But I'm also a big guy. Following the meal they present you with a cappuccino that tastes more like hot chocolate. Overall a good meal, with everything included in the price you see on the menu, which is on the wall if you're looking for it. I'll probably go back next time I'm in Vegas.",

When you enter there is an old man named Gordy who plays an accordion who tells stories about how Sinatra and the Rat Pack were regulars here.  The place is filled with pictures and autographs of stars and singers from the Vegas heyday. What is amazing as soon as they seat you they bring two kinds of house wine which is included with your meal. The wine is very good as well.  You also get oversized garlic bread and a great Italian salad with really good dressing before your meal. The seats are very big but the waiters and waitresses are awesome and friendly. I had the egg plant Parmesan which was fantastic and I also was thrilled because they brought out cappuccino with whip cream to end the meal. I think my total bill was about $38 but it was well worth it.  Definitely will go back.",

Never, the main course was so bad (chicken alfredo, sauce not to be identified, wife said it tastes of vomit and the meat sauce was anything but Italian).  Sorry guys, you can do so much better with less and keep the wine and the price and get rid of the corn sirup.  Classic Vegas???? I would dare challenge that as Vegas has a bit more to offer than a dark ambiance.  Fellow eaters be warned...... you will be disappointed and risk Diabetes mellitus....",

Great decor, dim lighting atmosphere, Dino Spimoni playing, an accordion man, good eye candy staff. Then we saw the forced menu (red house wine was great by the way!!!!!) im a fairly picky eater but managed the chicken vegetable soup (minus big vegetable chunks, mostly sipped the broth). Only got 1 thing of garlic bread, Homie asked if we wanted more but never brought it. Uuhhh what a tease I wanted more garlic bread. I ended up ordering the Ziti with 2(haha 2 balls) 2 meat balls. These meatballs looked like they were seared for a mere 30 seconds, my friends was basically just raw meat rolled in a ball. I took one bite and didn't wanna risk food borne illness (plus I fear vomiting more than anything in this world). The price was high. The Cappuccino was 99% hot chocolate 0.5 cappuccino, and 0.5 hot gas. I'm so frill never again will I endure the pain, suffering and agony of Battistas. My friend and I came to the conclusion ex WWE superstar Batista is the owner and if you bad mouth it he'll come out and give you a Batista Bomb!!!",

    "text": "Simone and I have always loved Battista's Hole In the Wall located just off the strip in Las Vegas. It has an old Vegas vibe, and always has very good home cooked Italian food.  We first went to Battista's during our honeymoon on the advise of a travel book and we have been back three or four times since. With our vacation winding down and the reality of going back to our everyday world creeping in, we decided what better way to cheer ourselves up then to visit our old standby.  Although located in a easy to miss small strip mall behind the Flamingo Hotel and Casino Battista's is always busy, no matter what time or what day you go, be prepared to either make a reservation or wait for at least 15 minutes. They are only open for dinner and locals and tourists alike fill up the many tables quickly.  Waiting for a table at Battista's is torture for the soul. As you sit and take in the many pictures of celebrities, the mini Liquor bottle collection and the strange Knic-knacks that fill the ceiling you are overcome by the delicious aroma from the kitchen of fresh baked Garlic Bread and Ripe Tomato Sauce. After about a 15 minute wait Simone and I were led to a table in one of the side rooms. It was only a few seconds before the waitress got to our table with two full pitchers of House Red and White Wine. This is one of the wonderful surprises that you get at Battista's. With every meal comes lots of House Red and White wine, and while a wine snob may not find this to be the best they have ever tasted, to a Maine redneck like me, it is perfection in a pitcher. Also free with the meal is some very toasty Garlic bread that is pasted with crushed whole cloves of garlic. Don't worry about saving the bread for dinner, when you finish it they'll bring you more... Each meal also comes with Minestrone Soup or a fresh Italian Salad with house made vinaigrette, salami, cheese, tomatoes and an olive.  We have never had the soup ( don't want to fill up on all that broth) but we do enjoy the salad. To finish off the free stuff you also get a side of basic pasta with your choice of sauce. There are no menus on the table at Battista's. They are posted on the wall of every room. Although the prices at first glance seem pricey ( chicken at 27.00- insanity !) keep in mind you are getting endless wine and bread, fresh soup or salad, pasta and oh yeah, the best damn Cappuccino ever to finish the meal. More on that later. For her meal, Simone had Spaghetti and Meatballs and I ordered Veal Parmesan. While we waited for our meal we were greeted with a song from our favorite little old man accordion player. It is rumored that he has been going from table to table performing since Battista's first came to Vegas more then 30 years ago. He looks to be in his nineties, but he plays a damn good accordion, and in my opinion ( which is always correct) He really just puts the icing on the whole Battista experience. Italian wine, Italian food and Italian music. You get it all when you are here. The food arrived shortly after our evening serenade and although I have seen prettier dishes, they were cooked perfectly. The Veal was literally drowning in melted Mozzarella and fresh ripe tasting Tomato Sauce. If you do not love your cheese then avoid this. If you do love cheese ( and also baby cow) then this is the dish for you.  Along with the Veal was a side of intense flavored spinach seasoned with spices including a good dose of nutmeg. This was different but good. Simone shared her meatballs which were also very good. Large, tender and well seasoned they mixed perfectly with the tomato sauce and al dente spaghetti. Surprisingly we finished everything ( including most of the wine-yow!)   After some deliberation we decided to finish the meal with the Italian specialty Cannoli, with of course two (free) Cappuccino's. The Cannoli shell was crispy and mildly vanilla flavored while the smooth and creamy cheese filling was rich and dense.  The Cappuccino is not to be missed, it is unlike any other - Its not at all like coffee. Its not bitter but slightly chocolaty sweet and it is the perfect way to end your meal.   We love it here and would suggest it to anyone looking to get away from the craziness of the strip, get drunk on cheap wine, and have some damn good Italian food while being brought back to the old",

    "text": "I used to really like this place. It was a must everytime I was in Vegas since the 90's. I brought someone new and I was pretty disappointed this time. I made reservations on a Saturday night for 8:30 for a party of two. We ordered two drinks a sea breeze with Shcmirnoff vodka and a gin and tonic. It was $26 for the two I was pretty surprised how expensive they were. Then we had dinner I ordered sausage Cacciatore with ziti pasta. I was surprised how small the portion was for $26 and they charge a minimum of $13 for a split fee but there is not enough food to split it. Two regular  size bowls of pasta at $26 each is outrageous?? It also comes with a salad which is also a joke it has one slice of salami which is thin enough to almost see through a few olives and one block of mozzarella about an inch and a half long. Everything is in chunks so you have to cut everything up. The plates are small so you don't have much room... The sausage Cacciatore wasn't much better. They just throw in one uncut long sausage link. My ziti was overcooked and mushy and my friend thought so as well. He wanted the spaghetti and meatballs but we were told that it has cheese in it. He can't eat cheese. Who puts cheese in their meatballs? All they suggested is it you can get spaghetti with meat sauce. How boring I felt bad. He ordered his with spaghetti and it was spot-on not overcooked it all. I was completely disappointed in my ziti pasta. I told them I wanted the the spaghetti instead since the ziti was overcooked and mushy. I could tell our waitress was not happy. No apology just brought me the tiniest little plate of spaghetti plain and then hardly saw her much after that. A different person served us cappuccinos for dessert. What they call Cappuccino is a complete joke for being an Italian restaurant. It doesn't taste anything like cappuccino it tasted more like instant hot chocolate that had way too much sugar in it. I don't know if I will ever come back again which is sad because I'm always really like this place. I was hoping to show my friend the accordion player but I was told that he was already gone for the night which was a bummer because he's been there forever... sad to say that was the worst experience I've had at Bautista's and I've probably eaten there at least a half-dozen times....",

    "text": "If you want to find a little piece of heaven just go to Battistas Hole in the wall.  When you first arrive you will most likely notice the decorations. It reminded us of almost an Old Italian mob scene. It was all so interesting to look at and entertaining! I have never been to a restaurant that I found it entertaining just to look at the walls and ceiling. Old black and white pictures covered the walls and they hung pots, pans, and baskets to the ceiling, which I felt gave it a very Italian feeling.   Now the food; AMAZING. Seriously, I don't think I can ever, I mean ever, eat at another Italian restaurant again. First we were offered breadsticks, salad, and soup. The garlic breadstick, to die for! I have never tasted bread that has tasted so delicious; I practically filled up on those before I could even order. For the main course I ordered cheese raviolis. Those where also the best I have ever had. The cheese literally melted in your mouth like butter. I couldn't stop my self from eating! My boyfriend got the eggplant Parmesan. Now that is some good food. I highly recommend that. It is now my favorite dish out of all the restaurants we go too. Its that kind of amazingly perfect good taste that can't be described.  After we ate we thought we would go out for desert. That didn't happen though! They brought out delicious cappuccinos. (They are apart of the dinner course so you are not charged for them) They were better then any hot chocolate/coffee/cappuccino I have ever had from anywhere else. It was the perfect amount of sweet and even though I was stuffed I drank the whole cup! (Which is a decent size)  Now I am really ready to go, but wait! It was my birthday and my boyfriend had surprised them and told them when he called for the reservations. They brought out a small piece of cake. AMAZING, AGAIN! It blows my mind that every course of this meal was spot on. It seemed like it was a moist sponge cake with delicious cream on top. I could have eaten like 10 of those.  The environment was also wonderful. I forget that on the strip people just want to have a good time. So even though we felt like the guests sat to close it was actually worth it. We joked with them and had such a good time. Our waitress was so sweet. I really felt like she took excellent care of us.  Now there are two reasons way I did not give this a 5 star. The location is the first. I would have never even known it was there. It is literally a hole in the wall. The area isn't the nicest but I am always paranoid about that.  The second reason was the \"lives music\". This man would walk table to table and plan a small 2-second snip of a song (of his choosing) and then ask YOU for a tip. I thought it was rude because we didn't ask him to come over so being forced to tip after was a little uncomfortable. I couldn't hear him sing over his accordion so I didn't get to enjoy it anyway. We only had a five so when my boyfriend asked for change back he acted like he didn't hear him and walked away. When he made his second round he made sure not to stop at our table (even though 5 dollars was probably his best tip of the night)  Over all I say GO! We defiantly will be!",

It starts with the stuffed moose head over the receptionist's station dubbed, \"Moose-olini\" and spreads to the walls filled with tiny airline-sized bottles of booze, pictures of celebrities and anything else one can think of except the kitchen sink. Who knows everything that is stuck in the ceiling. I was almost afraid to look. One thing I am sure of--it's all been there for a very long time.  ENTERTAINMENT:  A tiny, wizened, ancient little man who is seemingly dwarfed by his big accordion. He comes around every half hour for about two minutes, plays very badly (in a \"it's so bad it's great\" sort of way), panders shamelessly for tips and then disappears (probably to get oxygen and rebuild his strength for another two minute appearance a half hour later).  Ref: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w?select=jJQ-WqpZTRkjYGSqFF-nyQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yNVc...</a>  CONCEPT:  Charge double the value for run-of-the-mill Italian meals that are posted on a board and then try to compensate with free vino by the carafe. In a similar vein to Olive Garden, you can stuff yourself with unlimited garlic bread too. If you drink enough wine and chow down on the garlic bread, you'll enjoy the accordion serenades, go away full, and really not care about the quality of the meal and the price tag. If you're with good friends, it probably will be an enjoyable experience.  OUR EXPERIENCE:  We walked over to this little hole in the wall before a Penn and Teller show based on our concierge's recommendation. We drank the \"free\" wine, ate a lot of garlic bread, sang a lot of \"Happy Birthday's\" to various folks in the room, listened to the little old man butcher \"O Sole Mio\", and ate pasta dishes. I ordered linguini chopped clams in a white sauce for $26.95. The other dishes were all priced in the mid-twenties. My clams and linguini were of the $11.95 caliber. The wine was simply bad.  In summary, Battista's must have a very good working concept to stay in business for over 3 decades. That concept just doesn't work for me. I'd even recommend the place for those in a Monty Pythonish mood and looking for \"something completely different.\" If this is the case, just go in with the right expectations which shouldn't be centered around their culinary excellence.  Battista's was the only recommendation by our excellent concierge that I don't heartily endorse.",

    "text": "We happened across this gem after stopping by an info booth at Paris and asking for a good italian restaurant recommendation inside Paris or Bally's so we didn't have to go outside in the cold. The woman coyly asked \"Do you want a good place?\", which of course we answered yes. She told us about Battista's, mentioning more than once that it was the best in town and it was owned by the mob. We asked if it was expensive and she said no, because it was owned by the mob and it wasn't in one of the casinos. We were sold and were happy to make the quick walk outside and across the street to check it out.  The ambiance is charming. A sweet man was working outside and opening the door for guests to get in from the cold. Once inside, it was dark and cluttered with random memorabilia of all kinds. We knew immediately this was going to be good. It's what a lot of restaurant chains try to accomplish but this place did authentically. It was going to be an hour to an hour and a half wait, but neither of us seemed to mind, so we grabbed a seat in the bar area and had a glass of wine and some calamari.  The calamari was very tender and a good snack while we waited.   We were seated about an hour later, taken to the back corner of one of the seating sections. Every meal comes with soup or salad, garlic bread, free house wine (red or white) and a homemade cappuccino. All for about $25 for the basic half of the menu, up to $35 for some of the fancier options. They only have 25 items on their menu, and I'm sure they make them all exactly like your sweet Italian grandmother would. It was comfort food at it's best. The salad was simple, but a nice start to the meal. The garlic bread was perfect, toasted so it was crunchy on the outside with a garlic mixture and cheese on top. Once the entrees came, we were just so pleased. The portions were hearty, and you could taste the tradition and love that went into the food. It was simple and classic and delicious! The wine isn't incredible, but it's not bad either, and pairs very well with the food (I'm guessing they use the same wine to cook with). And where else on the strip can you get a full meal for $25 that includes all the wine you can drink?!?  Then, the perfect ending to the meal was the cappuccino they bring you (also included). It comes topped with whipped cream and has a lovely flavor (maybe amaretto?) that just made me melt into my seat in our cozy little corner of the restaurant. It was the perfect ending to our meal experience, no additional dessert required (though it's available if you want to add it on).   And Gordy! Gordy is the sweet, little (seriously, he is tiny) old man that walks around playing the accordion (and has been since 1981). As he approached our table, I wasn't trying to avoid making eye contact like i would most musicians in restaurants when I'm trying to eat. He was just cheerful and pleasant and adorable. He played a short song for me and my friend and was just cuter than words can describe.   If you are looking for deluxe, high end italian fusion, Battista's in not the place for you. If you are looking for a great, classic italian meal experience, you don't want to miss this place (my friend said she hadn't had cooking like this since she was in Italy about a year ago). AND, all for a total of about $25! This is definitely on the list of places we will always stop by when we come to Vegas!",

The meal began with a delicious bowl of garlic bread, accompanied by a poor choice of white wine (too sweet) and an adequate-but-uninteresting red. Soup or salad--one choice each and no other choices on dressing except the italian. Entrees were accompanied by a little plate of pasta (penne) and some underwhelming sauce.   Because the pricing was inclusive (hers $28; mine $32), the hit wasn't bad. But the quality was middling, at best. If we return, I'll look for something (perhaps lasagne?) more in their wheelhouse. But we'll likely just skip this in the future.",

I know places in OREGON that truly has better tasting chicken fettuccine.  There was a lot of food, and the garlic bread was good.  Actual cloves of roasted garlic are pressed into the bread.    Really i feel it's more of the EXPERIENCE that makes this place what it is.  It's cool they have pictures of Elvis and other famous faces, but really when it comes down to italian the next time were down, we're looking for something else....BUT HEY!!! Thx for all that wine!!!",

Terrible service. The soup was being service out of a big stainless steal pot with no top, that sat on a roller cart. The cart was in the walkway with a lot of foot traffic.",

    "text": "For years, DH and I have wanted to visit Battista's when in Vegas.  Finally, on Wednesday, November 23, the day before Thanksgiving, we came to have dinner.  It definitely gets a star for environment.  It's like stepping into Old Vegas.  You expect to see Sinatra and his Rat Pack sitting around the corner.  DH and I commented that our parents would have been right at home in this replica of the 1960s Italian hangout.  We were seated and immediately offered red and white wine.  As the waitress said, \"It's on the house.\"  Of course, it's on the house.  It's common red table wine, a bit vinegary for my taste but what the heck!  Immediately, DH said, \"Look at the tablecloth.\" I glanced down to see old food stains on the tablecloth.  Don't they wash their table clothes??  Yuck!   Should have gotten up and left right there.  We saw our waitress three times.  When she brought the wine.  When she took our order.  And, when she brought the bill.  The second star goes to the young man who was the bus boy.  He took it upon himself to serve our food and check up on us.    Now, let's talk food.  Having the menu off the wall was a cute gimmick.  DH ordered the Chicken Cacciatore and I ordered the Manicotti.  His soup was ok but a bit watery with a few veggies floating on it.  I had the salad.  Really liked the dressing that came with it.  A bit strange to see a piece of lunch meat on the top of a green salad, however.  Our entrees came.  Extremely generous portions.  Both of us commented that we could have shared one dish.  DH's chicken had a very interesting sauce on top.  I've never seen an off red sauce on Chicken Cacciatore before. I had a bite and the sauce tasted like it had tons of celery.  DH liked it.  Whatever was placed in front of me was definitely not Manicotti.  Manicotti is a long tube pasta.  I got what looked like a round ravioli filled with way too much ricotta cheese.  We didn't have their dessert drink because it doesn't come decaf.  The nice bus boy brought us decaf coffee instead.  Overall, average food if the prices were low.  But, considering the prices ($20s and $30s), it's outrageously  and inexcusably bad.  Finally, I want to say something about the creepy old man with the accordion.  I know that some people think he's absolutely adorable.  Sorry, I don't share the feeling.  He really made me feel very uncomfortable by leaning into me.  I even told DH to quickly tip him so he could leave us alone.  Thankfully, he never came back for more.    We came, ate, and will never come back.",

It was a huge portion. Overall I would give the lasagna 7/10. Good cheese but overall it didn't have as much flavor as I like lasagna to have. Still a good value. My wife had chicken Parmesan. Another huge portion. She gave it 6/10. I had a bite and would have to agree. Another situation where I would say it lacked flavor. Cappuccino came with the meal. Good presentation but I would say it's comparable to gas station instant cappuccino. 6/10 I would very much recommend this place to anyone looking for something off the beaten path.

It's a $25 meal, all-you-can-drink wine included, a 2-minute walk from the strip.  And you get what you pay for in Vegas, just like everywhere else.  With that in mind:  The highlights:    - The food isn't Gordon Ramsay quality, but it's not bad either.  The lasagna is better than a lot of restaurants I've had, and the Chicken Rio is worth trying.  Tons of garlic bread helps to soak up the wine so you can still do enough math to leave a tip.  - The wine isn't really that great.  But I'm usually hammered from gambling and drinking all day, so it's not like I'm looking for a $50 bottle anyway.  It's definitely quantity over quality here, but you're not going to even notice it after you polish off the first bottle.  - The service is average to above average.  I've never had a problem there.  - RESERVATIONS.  It's usually crowded, so save yourself a long wait and call ahead.    - The atmosphere is laid back and old school Vegas.  It's dark, there's stuff all over the walls.  Whoever decorated this place probably isn't even allowed in the Venetian, but it's a nice change from most upscale strip restaurants.  - Pay the old accordion player to play you a song.  He doesn't look like he'll be around a whole lot longer.    Once, I didn't want to leave half a bottle of wine (can't waste that stuff, you know), so I asked for a to-go cup.  They gave me one, no questions asked.  Only in Vegas.",

You get FREE (really) house white wine and red wine with your meal, as well as a house salad or minestrone, and after your meal, you get \"cappuccino\" which is more like hot chocolate with whipped cream on top.  I didn't have very high expectations for this joint, as my father was born in Sicily, so I get the \"real deal\" at home.  But, I had the cannelloni - and it was pretty darn good!!  Came with a side of cheesy, creamed spinach.  My husband had Cioppino- which had half a lobster tail, chunks of salmon, mussels, and scallops - a big bowl of good seafood in a mildly spicy tomato broth.  And every table gets unlimited garlic cheese Italian bread.  Portions are huge- taste is good-service is spot on.  It's as close to the real deal for those prices as you will ever get!  And you are privileged to dine in a nostalgic place, where the west was once wild, albeit Italian.  That's Amore!!!",

I'll take that over a chain restaurants microwaved wannabe 's anytime. No matter what anyone else may say about this place what counts is: 1 - Is the food fresh? and 2-Does it taste good?

We were a group of ten who made reservations two hours before we arrived. Battista's had no problem seating us as soon as we got there on a Friday night. I have read a lot of reviews saying the food here is sub par but if you have been to chain restaurants such as Olive Garden and Carino's, the food here is comparable but with a more enjoyable atmosphere .   Depending on what you order, the price varies between $21.95 to $40.00 and you receive soup or salad, garlic bread, entree, unlimited wine, and a cappuccino. I ordered the salad which I enjoyed, and the seafood linguini which included shrimp, scallops and sea bass. I did not regret my decision as it was delicious.    The wine is not a French Bordeaux or Traverse City Two Lads Riesling but it is drinkable and I enjoyed the red more than the white.   All in all, I left sustained and inebriated and happy.",

This is old shook Vegas at its finest. I imagined my grandparents eating there back in the day.   I hope this place never changes. Ignore the reviews about the small glass of wine...they give you a full carafe, so there's that. There's complimentary bread and salad/soup AND cappuccino after dinner. What more can you ask for?

The restaurant had a lot of tchotchkes and is darker but a cool place. (Don't he turned off by it being next to a liquor store)  Staff was friendly and very attentive. Best part was the little old guy that has been playing the accordion there for 38 years! He comes to your table and plays a little song for you, it was great!   The menu is on the wall and all dinners come with salad, garlic bread(which was so good), also a red and white wine. You can pick just one if you like.  We had chicken Alfredo, chicken parm and pasta with red meat sauce. All of it was great, chicken was tender and well seasoned. Each entree is in a price point so dinner is anywhere from 22-40 a person. However if you want to share, the minimum price a person is 13 so you can split an entree but everyone still get salad or soup, bread,  wine and the cappuccino. 4 of us went and shared 3 entrees and it was perfect.   There's no dessert but every meal includes a cappuccino which was amazing! I don't care if you're not a coffee drinker, it's at least worth a try, so good!   Would definitely go here again!",

For those who complain about the prices at Battista's, I think it is important to point out that you get a bottomless glass of red or white wine included in the price.  The red was certainly not fine wine, rather I'd call it an easy drinking wine.  The food is pretty darned good.  I'll pay $22 every day for a decent egg plant parm and all the wine I can stomach.  An added feature of note is the accordian player who makes his rounds serenading each table.  While I'm not a big fan of musicians performing at my table, this old dude is a real gem.",

But then it was paired with something (spinach) that was inedible. Seriously, I don't know how one makes spinach taste like that, my only guess would be artificial flavoring. Yes, it's that type of place. Then cap it off with cheap wine that'll give you a killer headache and some sweet hot chocolate standing in for coffee. Blech.",

It's typical italian with all the charm of a old school restaurant.  Since I hate the strip and I'm forced to eat there enough I love little places sticking it to the big guys - and this is one of them.  I was debating between 3 and 4 starts and after reading some weird reviews (lowball) on this place I figured 4.  The food is solid, the place is usually packed and the staff has always treated me well.",

The atmosphere is cool, but the menu is kind of pricey considering the service and the food. The best part about it all is the wine carafe that is 'free with dinner' so I don't know if you can really call it free or not. The old guy with the accordion is a really great scam, he pretends he's going to play a whole song for you but never actually finishes one and the proceeds to linger for his tip. The second time I used the 'no eye contact' strategy so that he wouldn't come bothering my table for money. Everyone pretended to be busy or on the phone!",

You have about 10 meal items to choose from and all come with wine, salad or soup, bread and meat selection. I don't drink wine so that was a waste, salad was OK, bread was excellent but the main dish, Lasagna, was poor. My wife's had the steak and she had the same reviews. Cost to eat here was around $80 for two of us.  We had better italian food @ Buca di Beppo at Excalibar and half the price.",

It's a nice change from spending too much in one of the hotel spots and it has \"character\" (or something like that cozy feeling).

If you want pasta, just pasta with cheese or meat sauce or whatever, price is either 18.95 or 20.95. Meat.. is more obviously..24.95 and up.

The white wine has subtle taste that works well with the italian food.  The espresso at the end is much more like hot chocolate than a normal espresso.   The only issue is the owner coming around with a accordion.  It's very awkward if you don't have anything to tip him with.",

We did not have a reservation so we put our names down and found s seat at the bar. The very nice lady at the bar was overwhelmed and perhaps that explained her less than friendly attitude. We compared the bar menu to the regular menu and there was not much of a difference between the two. We decided to have a few drinks and order a appetizer. The calamari was greasy and the sauce was more like plain tomato sauce . At that point and with a little help (or lack of) the help we called it a night.",

I chose the chicken Alfredo which was really good and he got the spaghetti with meatballs which was also good. The tomato sauce tasted very flavorful like it was simmering all day!

Just a note~If you make reservations everyone in your party has to be present in order to be seated. Also if you opt to share a meal there is a $13 fee. After you're seated you are greeted by someone (not your waiter). This person brings all you can drink red and white wine and all you can eat basket of bread sticks.  Then the person ask if you want salad or soup. You usually get your soup and salad before waiter comes to take your order. You also get garlic bread. The best I've ever had!!! While you wait it's a perfect time to look around at all the cool things on the walls, and ceilings. This place is full of cool stuff! You can actually see the menus on each wall or they can bring you a menu. The setting is kinda dark. Mood lighting. After you order it's usually to your table within 10-15 minutes. If you come on a night the accordion guy Gordy is playing he will come by and sing you a song while he plays the accordion. I love Gordy! Always look forward to seeing him. Be sweet and tip him a dollar or two. When your food comes you will not be disappointed. I recommend the chicken Alfredo. Everything is good on the menu! After dinner you get a cappuccino with your order. I have been known to come in just for the cappuccino. It's that good! They do have a dessert menu. But the cappuccino serves as a dessert. I can't think of anything I don't like about Battista's. Highly recommend!!",

It is a bit noisy so you have to stay close when talking.  The food was very good and the drinks were perfect.  My date loves Cosmos and I Sunrises so we had our fill before we left (thank goodness for Uber).  Wow!  Service was outstanding.  Highly recommended all around if you don't mind the noise.

As we were disappointed with the fact that there's not a lot of history we decide to try a little places that are not so main stream. This place hit the nail on the head! I have to say without a shadow of a doubt the best place in Vegas to eat Italian food. The food was so amazing! The price may be a little high but from what it includes it is totally worth it. And they had this accordion player he was such a sweet old man he played Frank Sinatra's New York New York for me and my family. If you're not from Vegas and you're just visiting I definitely recommend eating here at least once you will not regret it!",

First off, I recommend that you make a reservation in order to avoid the long waits.   Red and White wines are included with the meal!! Yes, you read that right. Unlimited wine.   The bread was the best bread I think I have ever tasted. It was light, garlicly, crispy on the outside but still airy on the inside. I could eat that everyday if my hips would allow me.   The lighting of this restaurant was extremely dark- like so dark that it was really hard for my eyes to adjust. It is the ambiance they are going for, but just something to consider.",

    "text": "This was exactly what I was looking for when we got to Vegas. An iconic \"hole in the wall\" Italian restaurant. We had ridden our razor for almost 500 miles through dirt to get here and it was the absolute perfect experience to finish an amazing week of traveling off road through the Nevada desert. We didn't have reservations so we had to wait about an hour for our table for two but it was well worth it. We sat at the bar and shared an appetizer a glass of champagne and watched the news while chatting with the bartender. When we got to our table we were tended to right away with wine water and garlic bread. There was an accordion player at another table which definitely added a little liveliness to the atmosphere. We ordered the lasagna and the shrimp mushroom pasta that was recommended by the server. Both dishes were delicious. We had so much food left over that we were able to eat it on our way home the following day. My husband and I both agreed that it even tasted better the next day. I'm going to make this restaurant my go to place when I visit Vegas. It hit the spot. (I forgot to mention that we ALMOST decided to go to a higher rated restaurant because Las Vegas has a million to choose from but I'm glad I stuck to my plan and gave Battista's  it a try!)",

My companion ordered the meat lasagne $26 and it was very heavy and also meh when it came to flavour. Yes it comes with crappy garlic bread and a salad that was fine and a oh too sweet cappuccino for $36. It was plain spaghetti with shrimp- boring. Because the food wasn't very good we left lots  and were far from  satisfied. I'd take a hard pass . Not worth either the time or money, can not understand why you need to make a reservation for a lousy restaurant.",

It has a traditional, almost kitschy charm and I will be damned if my cannelloni wasn't great. I mean, really good. The salad was tasty as well. I wouldn't bother with the \"complimentary\" wine, but you'll get a decent traditional Italian meal, complete with accordian player that will softly massage all of your Italian restaurant stereotypes.   On the pricey side, but not when you consider your salad/soup, wine, bread and dessert coffee are included. Service is robotic and friendly. Like tour guides that do it a thousand times a day.

    "text": "Last time we were here, and we go pretty often since we are in Las Vegas at least four times a year, I took away a star because the service was lack luster.  This time I'm taking away another star for the same reason and for the fact that the food just wasn't as good.  Again as a party of two we were stuck in a dark corner.  It took the server about 10 minutes to acknowledge our existence and then it was the assistant who finally brought water and checked on our starter.  The server asked whether we wanted red or white wine and then promptly brought the wrong one.  There was a large party coming in to be seated next to us, and for the life of me I can't figure out why restaurants insist on sitting two people only to be crunched in by a large party.  The server was so intent on making sure the napkins were folded properly, etc for the large party - bigger tip than two - that we finally had to call him over 15 minutes later to order our main meal.  When it came, I had linguine with chopped clams and hubby had mancotti, it just wasn't as good as usual.  While mine was topped with several who clams, there certainly weren't many chopped ones on top of the dish.  Hubby said his was ok but nothing to write home about.  So hot we declined the ending coffee and left.  Not sure we'll go back since the service seems to be all about the big parties and too bad for the tables of two.",

We had reservations and despite the extreme amount of people at the door we were seated right away, which I loved. Thank you for observing a reservation!!  As the other reviews mention, you get for the price of your dinner, unlimited wine, bread, a dinner salad or soup, entree, and cappuccino.   The wine was of course cheap and not anything close to what you would get at another restaurant that charges by the glass or bottle.... but seriously, its unlimited and free??? if you expected a good quality free wine in Las Vegas.... You also thought you were going to win at the casino, right??  The garlic bread was good... Salad was okay (no choice of dressing, house dressing or nothing) I had the spaghetti and meatballs.... ugh.... pick something else... this was so bland and tasteless.  I really wish I had tried another entree!!  My husband had the eggplant parmesan and he said his was pretty good. Prepared well and good flavor and portion.   We passed on the cappuccino... I wasn't feeling so good after drinking all that cheap wine........",

    "text": "Yelp lists 2 stars as Meh, I've experienced better and that's the most fitting for Battista's.    Walking into the \"Old Vegas\" institution I thought this might be a great find, or a mistake, you can say that about many things in Vegas.  I had a glass of wine at the bar before sitting down to get the feel of the place, lots of folks had reservations.  I should have stayed in the bar and ordered there instead of venturing into the dinner fixed price menu.  Service is great, the wait staff is the normal drink and food, union deal you find in Vegas.  Both servers were attentive.  The fixed price menu offers normal Italian fare, which is OK, the salad was OK, the pasta and meatballs were OK, the garlic bread was OK.  I've had better salads, spaghetti, meatballs, and sauce in many places.  Got - it's OK, just OK, not great, or good, just OK.    The dinner menu includes \"wine\", you get to choose red or white, the waiter said their house wine is a burgundy, I'm thinking something between a drier malbec and a chianti, then I noticed it was refrigerated like a white.  It didn't taste like wine, it tasted more like a MD red, watered down with grape juice and water with a dash of vinegar thrown in for acidity.  I like wine, I'm not a wine snob, but I do know some, this was bad stuff, impressively bad.  I sipped through a full glass of this swill, attempting to determine if it was indeed that bad, and then what one would mix to make such an abomination.    I don't see how the hole in the wall maintains a 4 star rating on most websites, they must have a small army of very dedicated folks entering great reviews to counter the actual reviews.  If you must eat here, stay at the bar and order a la carte, unless you really want to experience the house wine, if you do venture in to sample this liquid darkness, please post a response and tell me what you think is mixed together to make such a concoction.   So to summarize - Great service, OK Food, old Vegas atmosphere, incredibly bad house wine.",

In that regard it has established itself as a destination for authentic Italian food for locals and tourists alike. For many it may provide a nostalgic look and feel of old Vegas. However, beyond that their entree's, while not bad, offer in my estimation poor \"value to money\" in regards to price and portion. If you want to visit a restaurant with an old Vegas feel and has good \"value to money\" I would recommend the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge. And while there are many fine Italian restaurants in Las Vegas, I would recommend Nora's Italian Cuisine for good Italian food.",

In Las Vegas, there are a lot of big-money, generic restaurants that aren't all that original or interesting.  Battista's is not one of them.  It definitely has its unique charm and its culture that isn't found anywhere else.  The food was absolutely amazing.  From the garlic bread to the eggplant dish I had, it was delicious and I left feeling like maybe I could have used some restraint.  I would definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time.  It was packed and even with our reservations we had to wait ten or so minutes.  Definitely a place I'd recommend in Las Vegas if you want something local and interesting.",

The best part of the meal is that it includes table wine, salad, bread and cappuccino. Even just off-strip you could expect to pay $20-30 for just an entree, not including any of the extras. The place feels very kitschy and has a lot more character than anywhere else you can go, if that is what you're looking for.   This particular night I had the veal, which I can't say that I recommend due to its intense saltiness! However, I tried a bite of each other dish--fish ravioli, chicken alfredo, chicken rio, chicken parmesan--and they were all tasty.  I'll be back because it's a good deal and it's a fun piece of Vegas history, but no veal next time.",

I really liked the decor and we had calamari as an appetizer, which came out really quickly and was super.   The meal was delicious and the house wine was good, even though I shouldn't drink wine due to a sensitive stomach; my half glass was good! We all got the feeling that the server didn't really like us, for whatever reason, be it our behavior (we were actually pretty well behaved at this point in the trip) or his night not going so well.   Keep in mind the portions are very large and the minimum charge per person isn't so bad, even if you share a dish between two and have to tag on the extra $, because you will leave full and satisfied.

At the end of our meal they brought out 1 check with the normal additional gratuity added for large parties. Which we expect. When we asked the server for the separate checks he said that they could not do that.  We asked for the manager, who rudely told us no even after we explained the hostess had said it was okay.  She stated that she did not have time to deal with this as she was busy operating the house and walked off. The server was able to accommodate us eventually by running our cards for the individual meals we ordered..  Due to the manager being uncaring  and rude we will never be back again.. I feel for the servers there..but know as this place is one of those nostalgic places people will continue to go.  It is doubtful that the owner/manager will respond to this  based on what she said to us tonight .",

    "text": "When I first moved to Las Vegas, I walked by this place every day on my way to work, and never stopped in, thinking it was a tourist trap.  Now I wish I had taken the risk..  I would call this \"meat and potatoes\" Italian.   If you are looking for high end, delicate/innovative italian, this isn't it. This is old school italian.   It reminds me of what my grandmother used to make.  Stated another way, this isn't the  high end italian you would find in New York or San Francisco but it is eons above what you would find at Olive Garden.  I can tell a lot about a restaurant by the salad and dressing they serve.  So many restaurants in Las Vegas serve iceberg and drown it in gloppy dressing.   This restaurant  used a variety of greens and didn't drown the lettuce with an inch of dressing - good first start.  Service was friendly and prompt.   Server recommended the lasagna, and it was excellent..  They don't use cheap cheese here either.  And, unlike some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed their red sauce.    Wine was fine - reminded me of some hole in the wall italian restaurants in Rome I found myself in a couple of decades ago.   If you are a wine connoisseur and belong to three wine clubs in Sonoma, you are going to have issues, but for standard table wine, it was fine.    In sum, I would say good value for the money.   Efficient and friendly service, solid food, with quality ingredients.  For a strip restaurant, I didn't feel it was over priced, nor did I feel like I was eating at a chain restaurant.  We'll be back.  Do make a reservation.  I was shocked to see how many people were there on a dead Sunday nite in Las Vegas.",

Where, in Vega$$, can you get all that???",

    "text": "Wow, we were truly disappointed....just where do we start....?   -First off, I'm not a fan of being served on old PLASTIC plates and cups versus glassware.. -Second, the older waitress did not even offer us the menu, she simply passed by and said \" the menu is on the wall\" yet, the table that sat right next to us a few moments later where greeted with much more delight... -Third, we noticed that all entrees come with a TEN OUNCE meat of choice...therefore my we decided to \"split\" one entree since it comes with such a huge portion of meat, a salad, a pasta dish, bread sticks, wine and a cappuccino.  However, we were told we were NOT allowed to do so or we would incur an additional $13 charge for doing that...it's absolutely absurd that a restaurant charges you for wanting to share your plate with whomever you choose.  -Fourth of all, the wine was horrible.  Not near a quality red wine at all! -Fifth, the food is by no means FRESH...it is evident that the bread sticks were previously frozen and not freshly baked.  My fettuccine entree was absolutely disgusting, It was smothered in sooo much nasty sauce that I had to ask for an additional plate just to scoop all that extra sauce off my plate. The sauce seemed as if it was straight out of can, I'm almost certain that it was not prepared in the kitchen either.  Overall, this place is great for people who enjoy BIG portions without caring much about the quality of the food....",

I fully understand why they serve \"free wine\" with you meal - you need to get loaded for you to think this food is good. We went as a large group and ordered apps including fried ravioli, fried zucchini, calamari, meatballs and fried cheesesticks.  I was surprised that the apps were not hot, but it seemed they were luke warm at best. Then I ordered the cioppino.  Although it was full of various pieces of seafood, it was bleh.  The fish was overcooked and did not taste fresh.  The broth was a thick mush of slurry tomatoes - it was odd. The person I was sitting next to ordered the \"catch of the day\" and had the blackened swordfish.  It was burnt and as thick as dvd container.  He said it was the worst fish he has ever had - I believe him. The place is a total tourist trap and expensive.  If you are going to spend that much money, you should get a real Italian meal anywhere else.",

Simple fresh flavors that let the food speak for itself, and believe me they sing. The prices when you see them may seem high but when you realize that they include soup or salad, endless wine (red and white), garlic bread, your main dish, and coffee after diner it is a very good deal! The atmosphere is fun, and loud like in a real Italian house during diner. If you want real Italian home cooking then this is it.",

Our wait staff was helpful and attentive to our needs. It was my first visit, so there were explanations to get my expectations adjusted for how it works.   The menus are posted around the room walls and are simple to see/understand. The cuisine is much like you would expect for an Italian kitchen. All entrees are served to the table with your choice of wine (red or white) kept at the table, in carafes.    Our food came quickly, but not before a round of bread that was toasted and buttered and smothered in garlic. I can't be sure, but the bread may have been delivered straight from Heaven. A side salad or soup is offered while waiting for dinner. The salad was a garden variety with Italian dressing. It wasn't large, but it went well with the bread and wine.   The portions were quite satisfying. I was able to eat all of my Lasagna, and I was happy to walk from the restaurant to The Strip for an after-dinner show. The lasagna was served with a meat sauce and covered with a thin layer of cheese and baked to perfection.   I can definitely recommend this place and will definitely be returning.",

Next time you're at The Linq, keep an eye out, it's right around the corner.   Walking through the door is like walking through a time machine. Back to the days of well dressed gentleman and classy dames. White linen tables and cozy booths, romantic lighting and always full of laughter. There's a quirky accordion player walking up and down the aisles offering tunes for a tip. The atmosphere definitely adds to the experience.   All the menus are displayed on the walls above you. So if you're blind like me, bring your glasses. Be prepared for large portions. Sharing is recommended. You start your meal with complimentary garlic bread and salad which are very tasty. Oh and did I mention the unlimited house wine. Red for me please! ;)   Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Alfredo, Steak Pizzaiola are all at the top of my list. I'm glad I was introduced to Battista's by a very dear friend of mine and happy to share it with you. Save room for the cappuccino, worth it for the whipped cream alone. Mmmmmmm.",

Cost two us $80 including tip for chicken parmigiana and clam linguini. All of the above is included with the meal. It's close to Caesar's Palace, so a great place to go before seeing Absinthe or riding one of the sky rides. I was able to take my leftover cheap wine into the show, saving me $10+ on that. Our server, Frank was professional, top-notch. My only recommendation is having a wine upgrade available for $5 to $10.",

I had the chicken parmigiana and didn't come close to finishing. It was good, but not great. The included salad was my favorite part of the meal.  I would recommend if you want to get away from the pricey spots on the strip and have a relaxing Italian meal.",

You get soup or salad, bread, and cappucino with each order. The sauce was ok, but didnt think that penne pasta was a proper type of pasta to go with the eggplant but ok.The eggplant was very thin, and well breaded, smothered in mozzarella. My husband ordered the salmon dish. **Lights are super dimmed, but your eyes adjust.** Pro: place was clean, cozy, and you get a full course. The salmon with garlic and butter was delicious (but still salty). Cons: food is extremely SALTY...we both felt like it was packaged and heated rather than cooked fresh. Eggplant is a 2 out of 10. Dry, too much bread, and very salty. Just cheese, bread, and salt :/ Their soup was ok. Nothing extraordinary. The salad was bland.  Not the best spot to dine at in Vegas, in my humble opinion.",

    "text": "The food was good, but my overall experience was subpar. Prices are too high; the lighting (at least in the back corner room near the kitchen) was so low that I wanted to go to sleep; and the lack of customization of your meal choices is a big downside. Each meal comes with house wine, garlic bread, soup/salad, and cappuccino - which probably explains the overly priced plates. However, it felt like we were almost forced into getting all of the extras. For example, besides trying it out, we didn't drink any of the wine - which makes me wonder, how much wine do they waste in a night? Similarly, the cappuccino is served to you whether or not you want it. Some people in our group didn't drink theirs, and I probably would have passed on it too had they even asked us - especially if it would lower the price of the meal!  The biggest area for improvement, though, would have to be the service. Simple things (or what I think is simple or even common sense) like introducing yourself, smiling, and pointing out useful information can go a long way (e.g., the menu is on the wall, but we initially thought it was just part of the decor. It would have been nice if the hostess pointed that out when showing us our table.) Our server was decent and a little more friendly, but he had an assistant (or maybe he was the food runner?) that was uncomfortably awkward. It's hard to put into words what he was doing, but basically, he and the hostess could definitely improve on their customer service skills.  I want to like the restaurant - especially because it seems like it has a lot of history and the main dishes are good. However, I don't think my future visits to Vegas will include going to this hole in the wall place. The staff has plenty room for improvement in their communication and customer service skills.",

It's kind of funky with it's \"old style decor.\"  The food is OK, but I think it used to be better.  We've gone there almost every year, kind of a tradition, although I'm not sure I'll go back next year.  Chalkboard menu includes, soup or salad, entree, cappuccino (tastes like hot chocolate with whipped cream) and all the house wine you can drink.  Think the wine thing is why we first started going here ... we were younger.  But probably the best part is the fact that there is an elderly Italian gentleman who walks through the restaurant with his accordian playing Italian tunes and taking requests.  Was surprised that he was still there (he's 87) ... apparent he still plays a couple of nights a week.  And while he doesn't remember all the words anymore he still brightens up the atmosphere and it's fun to see him.  Our waiter said he makes more tips the the waiter himself. LOL",

Very Hole in the Wall place indeed, you get two carafes of wine with your meal for free (obviously built into the price ranging from $21.95-46.95 depending on what your order for an entree) one red and one white. Decent quality, I might add. We did not have a reservation, it was a Wednesday evening too I might add, but I've been here once before on a weekend and was able to get in without a reservation that time too.  The veal Parm was good as was the eggplant Parm. I like home cooked best, but for going out it was definitely one of the better eggplant Parms if not the best for dining out. You also have choice or soup or salad and your meal is also served with garlic bread which was very delicious too. To top it all off you get a cappuccino wuth your meal at the end which tastes more like hot cocoa mixed with coffee, but nevertheless still delicious!  I love the atmosphere and ambiance, old school mafia style dining, dimly lit but nice and roomy. If you've never been, check it out, little off the beaten path located behind the flamingo, but definitely a better place to try, less tourist trappy feeling.",

We made the walk from Planet Hollywood and it wasn't unbearable. We got seated right away and given a free carafe of red or white wine and then we ordered - I got the linguine with clams which was LOADED with clams and had a delicious white wine butter sauce on top. My husband got the chicken alfredo which was also delicious and large portioned.  There was also an older man going from table to table playing the accordion which was fun and added to the old school Italian ambiance which I felt here. Really enjoyed our time; would recommend!",

I've passed by this restaurant so many times and never stopped to try it out... until TODAY.   A couple of my friends and I came here for dinner (6:00pm reservation on a Thursday). Parking wasn't that bad (they have some in the front of the restaurant). My first impression of when I walked into the restaurant was \"its so dark & it has a ton of random stuff all over the place\".   They had our rsvp and sat us at our table. They kicked us off with some FREE white and red wine. (unlimited wine) Then dropped off some garlic bread. We were given option for the Minestrone soup or the house salad. I had the salad and it was pretty yummy.  For dinner I ordered the eggplant Parmesan. It was pretty good. There was so much cheese but not enough marinara sauce, so it was kind of dry. It did come with a side of pasta. For desert we ordered the Spumoni Ice Cream Pie; it was not impressing at all. Wasn't worth the calories.   The service wasn't good at all. Our server wasn't engaged at all. Came to the table only to drop things off. No conversation what so ever. The worst part was he dropped the check without even asking if we wanted desert. It wasn't even busy on a Thursday and we felt like we were rushed to eat and leave.   I would maybe give this restaurant another try and update my review.",

    "text": "Every time we come to Vegas, we have to make a stop here. Just slightly off the strip behind the Flamingo is this family style Italian restaurant. Every meal comes with house wine in white or red, soup or salad, a pasta side and hands down the best sweet cappuccino with whipped cream for dessert.   We started off the meal with red wine and salad. The salad is smothered in Italian dressing, which is delicious- but be aware if you're not a dressing fan. The wine is extremely drinkable. Just like a house wine you'd expect to get. We both settled for the spaghetti with two meatballs for our entree, which was perfectly sized for both of us (not the typical oversized plates you get at restaurants). They skipped the pasta side, but we didn't need it anyway. It was too hot of a day to worry about it. The sweet cappuccino with whipping cream was the perfect end to the meal.   Service was ok this time. It's been better in the past.   Spend your dinner sorting through the photos on the walls and taking stock of the odd assortment of items hanging from the ceiling.   Be warned: It's pretty dark in there. The dimmed lighting is a welcome shift from the glaring sun on the strip, but it's not good for taking photos.   If you're walking from the strip, be aware that the short walk to the restaurant may look a bit sketchy. But it's only about a block and you're still on a main stretch of road next to Bally's. Just don't be surprised if you see a panhandler or two and smell a lot of weed along the way.",

The experience started by entering the building through a parking lot that is dodgy compared to the strip. The inside is dark and covered in all sorts of framed pictures and memorabilia related to celebrities who have eaten here over the years. Also on the walls are oversized menus that give you selections based upon price. Note that free white and red wine is included in the meal price, as is your choice of soup/ salad. I chose a delicious Italian salad along with spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were outstanding and the pasta was well cooked. The wine, while not high end, reminded me of homemade wine I used to drink at my best friends home growing up. Mama Rosa would be proud.   Service was great. The bartender was snarky and somewhat indifferent but I liked her style. Our servers were perfect, moving us along at a pace the suites us.   Overall I recommend Battista's highly but go there expecting it to be what it is, not some high end restaurant.",

    "text": "OK, so I was in Glitter Gulch last weekend for some R&R (as well as some gambling), and I decided to eat dinner at Battista's Hole In The Wall.   Short version: A kitschy Old-World Italian trattoria with lots of atmosphere, big portions, lots of wine and pretty decent food. If you want to see Old Las Vegas before the Disneyland transformation, this is it!   Long version: Battista's has been a staple of off-Strip dining since 1970, back when Las Vegas was REALLY \"Sin City.\" It's in a crude strip center next to a liquor store, and for a lot of tourists it's off the grid.   Yeah, the facade looks like an Italian flop-house, but go inside - good value awaits you there!   Battista's is only open for dinner, so plan accordingly. Don't eat too much at the lunch buffet at your hotel, because you'll need the extra room in your pants for the portions.   The menu never varies except for the price. Almost everything is prix-fixe, meaning that you get a 3-course meal for under $30, including a free carafe of house wine. Yes, I said FREE. Whoa.   I got there at about 5 pm (7 pm Central time, when I usually eat) and immediately got a cozy table next to the bar. There was a lot of old celebrity memorabilia and pics all over the restaurant. It's not uncommon to eat between pictures of Sophia Loren and Dean Martin at your booth or table.   Another amusing part of this kitschy restaurant is the strolling accordion player, who is all of four feet tall and probably 100 years old. This guy not only can play classic favorites, but he sings as well! Cool!   Since I was in a carb mood, I ordered the lasagna. It came with a choice of soup or house salad, lots of garlic bread, a carafe of red wine (my choice) and cappuccino as a dessert. Price? $28. WHOA.   It was too hot for soup, so I ordered the house salad. It was a nice leafy blend of greens but it could have used a bit more dressing. I would have liked some on the side, but still, it was a hearty affair.   Now on to the lasagna. One word - DELICIOUS. It was also huge as life. Nice and piping hot and baked in ovenware. Pics attached as proof.    It was pleasantly flavored but since I like a lot of pepper and kick to my Italian food, I was happy to find both crushed red pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese on the table next to the salt and pepper. Nice.   It was so big that I could barely finish it. I'm sure that people with smaller appetites would take the leftovers home - like my idiot sister, who has the appetite of a baby sparrow (not to mention the IQ of one). But I digress.   The cappuccino was a bit of a let-down. As others have mentioned here, it tastes more like hot chocolate than an espresso with milk. I have a feeling that they pre-make it, because when I asked if I could have a decaf version, the waitress said \"no - it would be a special order if we did, and it would cost extra.\" Gotcha.   So, here's the Peter Hughes Exit Question - would I come back? The answer is a resounding YES. If you are tired of fast food, hotel buffets and pricey restaurants inspired by obnoxious celebrity \"chefs,\" then Battista's is a hole-in-one for you. ABUNDANZA!",

The food was not great. The pasta gravy was flavorless. The veal had the right texture, sort of, but had no flavor. The pasta itself was cooked to perfection but it had nothing to give it flavor. The Chianti was terrible.   It's hard to give Batista's only a three but the price point did them in. It's not cheap and so they have to keep their end of the bargain. The food must be of good quality and flavorful and worth eating. What I was served was not.",

Very savory, not too spicy, and a generous portion. The cappuccino at the end of the meal is always a delight. Kari provided top notch service on this visit!

When we arrived went up to the check in stand, only to have the hostess roll her eyes as I gave our name. It gets better our waiter just went thru the motions, as little interaction as possible.  They do serve complimentary red and white wine, nice touch. Tried the red and it wasn't bad. We were served hard crunchy garlic bread.  Around this time an Older hunched over man approaches with an accordion wants to know where we are from. California we say, so he breaks into signing and playing a line from California Here I Come! Ok, then he says \"aren't you going to give me something\"? Ummm, my husband says Sorry just have an ATM card, no cash. He gets angry, my husband says I'll try and catch you on the way out, so he begins to argue about how we aren't leaving him a tip so why bother!  So here comes the salad, it's ok. We ordered pasta and lasagna, just average not bad, but just ok. Prices are a little high probably to off set the wine. Sadly we won't be back, way to many great restaurants in Las Vegas.",

Not the best Italian I've ever had but you can't beat free wine and a 3 course meal for $34! The service was fast. Maybe even (dare I say) too fast? What I mean by that is the waitress was curt and didn't really engage us...would have loved it if she had been more personable and friendly, but either way I can't say it was bad! We got our food in a timely manner and had so much we couldn't even finish it! Definitely stop in here if you haven't before- it's worth it to enjoy an authentic Old Vegas dining experience!",

    "text": "Not sure what all the hype with this place is all about . I was very excited to take my BF here and to try it based on the hype and recommendations from a friend.  I made dinner reservations weeks in advance for 6pm. Arrived early and were seated right way after the hostess and a manager debated over if They could seat us because they only had 6 other open tables. Stupid.  At this point I was still excited but the menu isn't very extensive and the prices super high for the quality of food that we were served.   We started off with house salads that were kinda boring with field greens, spinach and a sprinkling of cheese. The garlic bread they bring to the table is delicious however.  The bring house wine that is complimentary but probably the most bitter wine I have ever had so I ordered a cosmopolitan. I would have ordered a second because it tasted good but was never offered another. The cosmo was almost 11.00 btw.  The BF ordered the evening special the steak Bella. The mushroom pasta that he was served was delicious.  I ordered the Chicken Parm, it is served with a tiny amount of penne pasta and it was just okay.  It wasn't very flavorful. I think the Chicken parm was 32.00-36.00   The after dinner drink that is included with dinner is a cappuccino. It was most likely from an instant cappuccino machine and if it wasn't it tasted like it did.   They do not have a dessert menu. You get a cappuccino after dinner.   I was expecting authentic, flavorful Italian food and left disappointed.  Disappointed that for the price we paid the food should have been much better.   The noise level escalated when they sat a table of 25 in our section.   FYI: Also I heard the waitress tell the table next to ours that they charge 13.00 if you share dishes.   Take some cash with you because there is a senior that will come around playing the accordion and it would be nice to tip him.   Pricing: includes soup or salad, garlic bread, entree, and cappuccino. Oh and the unlimited amount of table wine.  Prices range from 21.00-36.00   Parking wasn't an issue in front of the restaurant.",

I've had the chicken parmesan and on another visit, spaghetti with red sauce.  Both dishes were great, and the portions were HUGE.  Even better was the free wine they kept bringing (it's all you can drink, and it's a house red or white served in a carafe).   The place reminds you of gangster hangouts you've seen in the movies.  It's dark inside, no windows (reducing the chance of driveby's), with lot's of nooks and crannies (small rooms, and even smaller rooms). One great advantage to their location is their proximity to the hotels on the strip, but your not on the strip.",

    "text": "Yelpers, I love ya, I really used your feedback to plan my latest trip to Vegas.  So take it from me, this place sucks.  We were staying at Bally's, upgraded to a great suite, having a great time.  Also having fun finding the best low-cost meals (see Ellis Island and Gold Coast reviews).  But we had a hankering for Italian and the restaurant inside the Bally's (for which we had scored 1/2 price coupons) was closed (!).  We had seen Battista's on our way to Ellis Island, and decided to try it, despite not-so-stellar reviews.  The outside is ugly, but the inside atmosphere isn't bad, typically Italian, pictures on the wall, old menus, photos of old Vegas, whatever.  Oddly, fishing nets on the ceiling -- did this used to be a fish joint?  Impossible to know.  Now one of the problems with this place is -- entrees are expensive.  But, that's because salad and hosue wine are included.  Big deal.  We order, and the waitress asks us if we want red or white.  Me -- white, wife -- red. So she brings two full carafes!  We barely drank 1/10 of each -- there goes most of our money.  The wine wasn't that good, BTW.  Then the fabled little man with the accordion stops by.  Seriously, he is old and bent over.  It's like having Gollum come to your table to play music.  To be honest, he wasn't as creepy or disturbing as we feared, given previous reviews, but he definitely plays a few moments of a tune and then wants a tip.  I gave him three bucks and thankfully he went away permenently.  Then we got our food.  I got fettucine alfredo with chicken, and I did not like it.  It tasted like the kind you would get from Sbarro (a place we had considered) -- not cheesy enough.  Admittedly, the wife really liked her eggplant parmesan.  But I almost immediately started feeling sick.  We got the check, and hopped the monorail to the tropicana to see Bobby Slayton, but by then I was feeling pretty bad and we ended up skipping the show.  We didn't care -- Slayton was a cheap ticket and just a way to fill time.   But as far as Battista's goes -- I don't recommend it.  There must be better opportunities.  P.S.  Bally's rocks, and for dinner, Ellis Island and the Gold Coast buffet rock.",

    "text": "My experience with Italian restaurants is that the best ones are not overseen by some chef wanting to make his or her mark on the cuisine, but by an immigrant who had spent the majority of his or her life feeding the family, and now that the kids are grown, has taken those skills to care for the restaurant's patrons. These establishments are usually holes in the wall, garlic and tomato-scented spots inserted into strip malls between a convenience store and a dry cleaners.  With that in mind, I chose Battista's Hole in the Wall when I went out to dinner with a group of convention-goers in Las Vegas last week.  First off, this place is FUN! The walls were as crowded as the restaurant itself with pictures of Las Vegas royalty from years past. Trinkets and chotchkies hung in the room's nooks and crannies. Entering this restaurant is to enter the home of a person devoted to living life around the dining table, for that is where the day begins, pauses for respite, and ends.  Once seated, a stern waiter placed carafes of wine on our table, announcing that the wine and garlic bread are free, and the menus are on the wall. And indeed they were, but we hadn't noticed them until this fellow had called them to our attention.  During our meal, a petite octogenarian traversed the dining room with an accordion as big as he (if not bigger), playing various tunes on request and hamming it up for the crowded tables. He focused on the pretty lady at our table and played her the tarantella, pausing to point at the black buttons on the left hand of the accordion to passionately cry: \"The BASS! Nobody plays BASS anymore!\" This was indeed dinner and a show.  I had the cannelloni. It was OK. The accompanying spinach reminded me of frozen spinach, the kind that came out of a box and most of us generally detested as kids. A similar complaint came from another member of the group, who'd had the salmon and expressed concern that it had freezer burn. I'm not an expert in meat, so perhaps group-think has since led me to believe that the meat in my cannelloni was similarly spiced. Another member of the group called the cappacino that the restaurant gives for free at the end of the meal: \"truck stop cappacino,\" referring to the machines that make it. It's no Starbucks drink, and it does taste like hot chocolate, which is why I liked it.  Would I come here if I were dining alone? No. Would I come here with my date? Not a chance. This restaurant is not suited for such moments in our lives, neither where food nor ambiance are concerned. However: would I come here with a bunch of acquaintances who want to have a good time and perhaps eat a little food in the process? Sure. Battista's Hole in the Wall drops the pretentions of normal dining, challenges us to not take things as seriously as we normally do, and pay attention to those oft-ignored things that we rely upon throughout life.  For, in the words of the restaurant's owner: \"The BASS! Oh, NOBODY plays the BASS anymore!\"",

A very simple menu with a main course including apps (salad or minestrone, and garlic bread), wine, and cappuccino at the end of your meal.   The price isn't cheap if you aren't very hungry and are looking for something small, but it's an amazing value especially when you are hungry. Everything is made in house.   Ambience is very family style, loud, and slow. Nobody is in a rush when you come to eat. Lots of cool stuff hanging on the walls, with a claim of the worlds largest mini bottle collection. Could seem gimmicky, but you're in Vegas. Still family owned and I definitely plan on coming back the next time I'm in town.",

I recently went with a group of 12 for dinner. The service was good and the noise level was a bit boisterous. Let's not forget about the old-school Italian ambiance. The food was good, not great, but the portions were generous, very reasonably priced and included a lot - in addition to the main dish each meal came with a side of salad, pasta , a cappuccino (although it was actually hot chocolate), and unlimited red and white house wine. It's definitely a must-visit, especially if you're coming in a group - bring your appetites!",

First: The food is amazing! If you are looking for comfort Italian food this is the place. Living in New York for 8 years I know good Italian and this place is delicious. My guests, my husband, and myself loved it! No complaints. Second: The price is unbeatable. They include all the essentials to a wonderful meal, even table wine. We spent, including tax and tip, $1500 on dinner. With that being said, we did do a limited menu but our guests still had over 10 options with chicken and even a few seafood selections. We also brought in an outside cake in which they cut and plated for us right at the table for no additional charge. Third: The service was incredible!!! Our waitress was Kim. She was so awesome and so in control. She assured us as soon as we sat down that we would have a wonderful time and we did. Everything came out in a timely matter, the right things ordered, and her whole team was so sweet! Lastly: Making the reservation was a breeze. They sat us on time, the host crew and management crew were so kind and knowledgeable in all my questions leading up to the big day! I want to thank these guys so much!!! For anyone considering this place, do it!!!",

All entrees come with salad or soup, garlic bread and wine. Let's start with the wine. It's watered down and blah. The garlic bread was ok but it's more Parmesan than garlic. The entrees were bland and tasteless. The chicken in my chicken Alfredo was tender but bland. The Alfredo sauce itself didn't taste like anything. The other person who got it said his was bland. My friend's meatball was more like a meat clump and the sauce was a disgrace. The salad was the only part of the meal I enjoyed. Those that got the soup were not terribly disappointed but not impressed. Service was a bit slow but the staff was nice. For Vegas, the prices were not bad but because the food was so disappointing, we all felt cheated out of $40/person for crappy food. You can skip this place.",

The meatballs tasted store bought, chicken was drowning  in a acidic marinara and the linguine with clams was tasteless. The highlight of the meal was was a mediocre minestrone soup and garlic bread. We opted out of the cappuccino since the table next to us said it tasted like hot chocolate. To top it off our server (Rick I think) was preoccupied with everything other than his tables.  It is completely overpriced for the quality....Won't be back",

I don't drink, but the rest of my family does so this saved us probably at least 100 bucks in drink charges.   A family of four, all of us got a full dinner, great salad, excellent minestrone, yummy, super buttery garlic bread and a \"cappuccino\" after. I had the manicotti which I couldn't finish. Took it home and had it for another 2 meals the next day!  Hubby and mom had lasagna. Dad had spaghetti meatballs.   We will return!  Dark, romantic, little place with a ton of old school memorabilia. This is our second visit and I think we'll make it a staple for our Vegas trips. It offers a nice break from the flashy noise and exorbitant prices on the strip.",

We were staying at The Linq, so it was a quick 10-15 minute walk. We had reservations and were seated immediately. The tables are close together so you can hear the other tables conversations. We were given a large carafe of both white and red wine at our table. The food is old school Italian- the minestrone soup was really good, as was the garlic bread. I had lasagna (huge portion!) and my husband had spaghetti with meatballs. The cappuccino was great as a dessert! Our bill was $50-60 for two- a great deal for this much food in Vegas!!

    "text": "Take a Lyft from the strip. It's $5.   Get the minestrone soup. The salad is fine, but it's a generic salad--though it has salami and pepperoncini in it. Nice.   Forgot to review it when I was there this week. Absolutely the best Italian place in terms of ambiance and food. The place is old Vegas, clean, and fun. Most of all, they leave you the hell alone without the fake waiter upsell/tip earning crap at a chain restaurant. They don't care what you think, they're just going to bring you the best food imaginable. I suggest everyone order something different--that way you can share.   The wine is fantastic. People complaining about it being table wine are probably the types of folk that swish $80 cab blends, make up some loosey-goosey adjective about its smokey aromatic legs, and spit it in a bucket at country club events. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life.   Make sure you have $1 or $2 in cash to tip the accordion player. Stop bitching and just do it. He's earned it.   As spineless as it sounds, get the spaghetti and meatballs. It's cheap and wonderful. The steak pizzaiola is a good backup. Veal parmegiana [sic] is a good 3rd, if you are cool with eating children. I was.   Cover that shit in red pepper flake--being Italian in the 21st century means not an ounce of spice in the prep, sadly. It'll kick it up a bit, unless you're the sad sack that thinks sea salt is exotic.",

    "text": "Three stars has to be the highest rating I have ever given to a restaurant where I found the food to be nearly inedible, but my wife liked her linguine shrimp, and the restaurant is so popular that I must be missing something.    First of all, if you look up \"tourist trap\" in the dictionary, you will find a picture of Battista's.  I speculate (emphasizing the word \"speculation\" and not \"allegation\" here) that, in a nod to its alleged mob past, someone is greasing the palms of every cab driver and concierge in town.  Whatever they are doing, it is working.  The place seems to be mobbed (pardon the pun) every night.  (Make a reservation!)  People seem to like the complimentary wine, garlic bread, and soup or salad.  Personally, I thought they were worth every penny, so to speak.  The only exception was the complimentary cappuccino, which was pretty good.  I would have ordered a different salad, but the very sparse one-page menu has no other salads, or soups for that matter.   Or wine list.  You eat and drink what they put in front of you.  I ordered the sausage cacciatori, which consisted of a pretty bland sweet Italian sausage link in a bed of some very weird sauce.  My guess is that the sauce was mostly green peppers, with a touch of tomato and garlic, run through a blender for ten minutes.  Yuck.  I also tried the side order of meatballs, which were also bland but at least the sauce tasted more or less like canned tomatoes.  Time to start thinking about drive through at McDonald's on the way home.  The service was okay, I guess.  Kind of slow and kind of disinterested, but the food got to the table.  The ambiance was busy, with lots of knick knacks and photos of entertainers on the walls.  The prices were not a huge bargain, but were acceptable if you count some of it as going to the complimentary wine.  (Here's a secret:  If you sit in the bar you can order a version of the full dinner menu without the \"complimentary\" wine, at a much lower price.  And also avoid the wait for a table.  They don't trumpet this deal, so you heard it here first.)  So, anyway, we won't be going back to Battista's.  If you are willing to wait 45 minutes for a table at an Italian restaurant, I would recommend going a couple of miles west on Flamingo Boulevard and eating at Nora's Italian Cuisine.  Much better food at comparable prices.",

During our dinner here, several comments were made about how we were sure there were many mob hits ordered over dinner in this joint throughout the years.   But that is actually a huge compliment to the establishment... Mobsters always seem to find the best restaurants to frequent! :-)  Anyway, I really enjoy the environment of this restaurant!  And the food is pretty damn good as well! They have a few good option for vegetarians.   I had the eggplant parmesan with creamed spinach and I recommend both selections highly.  The salad, garlic bread and free wine are almost excellent as well!!  The only thing that raises an eyebrow is the drink they give you at the end of the meal, which is called cappuccino but tastes more like really sugary hot chocolate.  But I guess I shouldn't complain... It's included in the price and it's nice of them to round off the meals in such a way.    I love this place and you should definitely hit it up!",

    "text": "Battista's Hole in the Wall  Location/Parking: Battista's is a quick, easy walk from the Strip in a little strip mall across from Bally's. Look for the big sign. You can't miss it. But don't even think about driving there, because by the end of dinner you won't be able to drive home.   Atmosphere:  Always crowded. Always a wait. Plan ahead. Seriously. Don't just show up when you're hungry on a Friday evening and think you're gonna waltz right in. Not even on a random Tuesday night. It's always packed with at least an hour wait. Call ahead.   That said, it's totally worth the wait. Very friendly, cozy, warm atmosphere with a wandering accordion player. Nice touch, that. Not too loud, not too stuffy, no screaming brats. Nothing fancy and it probably hasn't been renovated since well, ever, but it's a nice place for dinner with friends or a long, relaxing date. Just maybe not a first date.  Cleanliness/Service: Decent enough service. No issues regarding cleanliness. I've been here half a dozen times and have never had a bad experience.  Food/Drinks: It's not authentic homemade Italian like your Grandma used to make, but it's not high school cafeteria crap either. Huge portions so don't fill up on the bread. Well, unless you're already on your second carafe of wine. Think Olive Garden or Carrabba's quality with unlimited wine.   So far I've tried the Lasagna, Chicken Parmegiana, and Chicken Rio. They're all good but the Chicken Rio is my favorite. A friend of mine had the salmon (fresh fish of the day) and said it was very good. I keep meaning to try something different, you know, to give a more thorough review, but the Chicken Rio is just so good. Maybe next time.   And the after dinner Cappuccino. Best. Cappuccino. Ever. Yum. I mean seriously. I would go there just for that. It's delicious. Very hot chocolate-y. Not sure if it's a legit cappuccino or not, but honestly, who cares?!   Price: About $28 per person, but that includes your entree, unlimited hot garlic bread, salad or soup, and wine. Yes, wine. House red, house white, or both if you ask nicely. The unlimited wine makes the price much better. It's definitely a good value for the money. You'll never leave hungry. Or sober.   I love this place and try to visit two or three times a year. It never gets old. Don't forget to tip the accordion player to play you a tune. He's old. He might not be there next time.",

The Chicken Rio, not seasoned at all; tasteless, and the vegetables were not warm. Robert Irvine would send it back!  The FREE red wine that is offered is a cheap burgundy, that no one in their right mind would drink.  A regular glass of Pinot Noir was ordered and sent back since it was about 2 shots of horrible wine.  The included cappuccino was not even coffee.  It was obviously the powdered International Coffees from Kraft, with added whipped cream to mask the Falseness of the drink. A very unpleasant experience. With the hundreds of restaurants in Las Vegas, this is a major failure.",

If you're a Las Vegas native, then you've probably eaten at this place at least once.  If you haven't and you are a LV-native, the \"what the hell are you waiting for?!\"  It's been around for a long time and usually when an establishment lasts a long time, especially a restaurant, it's because people actually care about the establishment.    My wife had the Seafood Fettuccine and I had the Sausage Cacciatore with an order of meatballs (we love Meatballs).  All was great.  We were welcomed with the house White and Red wine (it was free by the way).  Garlic bread was good and we both chose the salad.    The main course took a while to prepare and the waiter was not very friendly.  Hence I gave the place a 4 star, instead of 5.  If this place had a drive-thru, then I'd probably give it a 5 star.",

First and foremost, the ambiance is way cool. I love all the trinkets hanging from the ceiling, the showcase of all the mini-alcohol bottles, the signs on the walls, etc. It is a tad bit dark, but it is called a \"hole in the wall\", and I feel like it fits perfectly. Think Buca Di Beppo, but way more authentic and awesome looking.   Second, the staff is/are really nice and helpful. Our waiter was very informative, patient, and efficient with his service. There's also a sweet older gentleman that walks around playing the accordian at each table--and he takes requests!   Third, the food is amazing. We were informed by our waiter that it does take awhile to make and get your food because they do take their time and ensure that everything is done correctly and deliciously. The food was indeed awesome. We are big garlic lovers, so to us, even the (unlimited) garlic bread was pristine. What was very cool about this place is that literally everything is included in the price of your meal--unlimited red and white house wine (Burgundy and Chablis) carafes,  garlic bread, your choice of soup or salad, and a delicious cappucino to finish the meal. I was sold on the fact that I could essentially have my own personal carafe of red wine since no one else at our table drank.  It was an all around wonderful experience. I look forward to coming here again and again in the future. This place will definitely become a Vegas tradition for our group of friends.",

It's one of those Vegas iconic spots.  Their menu set up is unique but sticks to a modest range of  mostly traditional dishes. They offer salad or minestrone soup with each dinner..... but ONLY offer Italian dressing.  I hate vinegar so i was  bummed about that.  We all ordered something different so we could try each others.  We ordered lasagna, eggplant parm, spaghetti with meat sauce and chicken rio.  We were all most excited about the chicken Rio as none of us had ever even heard of it.  When we cut into the chicken to share it..... it was raw, like totally pink.  Ugh!!!!  They quickly took it back and  brought another plate out pretty quick but acted like nothing happened. The eggplant parm had 4 nice size pieces of eggplant but 2 of them were undercooked and couldn't even be cut with a knife, no one ate them. The pasta that came with the eggplant was cold. The lasagna was good. The sauce, in general, is just bland. We were never offered desert and my water was never refilled. I was never asked if i wanted a 2nd glass of Moscato. I started this review with 2 stars and as i wrote this i downgraded to 1..... they get 1 for ambiance.  We had reservations for 4 at 445pm on Saturday.",

Regarding food, it was impressive how our 4 dishes had different flavors - despite all of them having a tomato sauce base. I had the steak pizziola or something like that and it had an intense garlic mushroom tomato sauce. Someone else on the table had lasagna and someone else had the cheese tortellini - all were very good and the tomato sauces were each different. Not the greatest dishes ever but solid and tasty.   The all inclusive is a nice touch. Bottomless house  wine! And a cappuccino! Reasonable prices, not too expensive, but not a super great deal.   All in all I'd come back here and recommend to friends!",

That was \"before\" it became a tourist attraction.  In the early days only the \"locals\" knew and supported Bassista's.  Battista himself was there as well as some of his family.  An entertainer would come by and tell \"very naughty\" and also very funny jokes with an Italian flair.  Unlimited wine was also served for one price per person.  The last time I visited was back around 2003.  I was with a very savvy business woman and we ended up in one of the back unused rooms and spoke to several of the original (or close to original) employees.  While Battista's remains an over good place for many - unless you visited them before they expanded decades ago, you'll never know what you are missing.  It wasn't just a good meal, it was an experience.",

Double bonus....but to our surprise the food was sooo tv dinner ;but with less flavor and 1000% increase in price than Stouffers...which would have been tremendously better.  The service was good, and the salad was average. The garlic bread had flavor but was stale, and my fettuccine alfredo had no flavor...i had to salt my dish 4 times! My finance's dish was equally disappointing...and the wine tasted like it came out of a cardboard box. We are foodies and my fiance just so happens to be a chef that cooks the cuisine of northern and southern Italy..so this was the worst food we had ever paid for.  Never again.....could have made good food for 40 for the price we paid.  If you have the palate of the average person, I would definitely suggest saving your money and either going to the frozen food section of the grocery store or cooking at home.  Even if you cant cook, look up a recipe and try it yourself.  It would be more fun and better tasting ........REGARDLESS!!!!!",

To me, I loved the service, FREE wine, food and atmosphere.  Would definitely go back again!",

The best part of my meal i would have to say is the garlic bread in the beginning.  Lasagna was ok and my wife had a chicken dish which was ok as well.   I would go somewhere else unless you have your heart set out on some OK Italian.",

It's not the cheapest place in town (Meals start at about $20) and it's absolutely no good if you don't like cheap wine. But, if you can afford it, and you like cheap wine... This is it! There's even a strolling accordion player named Gordy to serenade you during your meal. You get your choice of standard Italian entrees (My favorites are the Lasagna and the Veal Parmigiana) and meals include, salad, great garlic bread, your entree, hot chocolate (they call it a cappuccino, but it's hot chocolate) AND, oh my god, are you sitting down for this? ALL THE CHEAP WINE YOU CAN DRINK!!! They'll ask you if you like white or red. If you're smart, one person at the table will say \"red\" and someone else will say \"white\", that way they'll bring two carafes right off the bat... then they just keep bringing them! Oh, you'll feel so sick in the morning!",

The decor and history of this place is very interesting and the food was just what I had wanted for the evening. We had garlic bread, salads, our main meal and lots of wine. I could have been just a nice uneventful evening enjoying food if it had not been for the folks in the both behind us. I think what caught our attention was the loud guys saying, \"Fucking Wetbacks\" and then continuing to quote fox news, Rush Limbaugh, and Bill O' Riley. I would have just been amused by the politics and ignorance but the racism was just uncalled for and made the dinner a bit less than enjoyable. I do not fault the restaurant or penalize stars but just had to share. It was good to know I was not the only one annoyed because another patron stood up and told the guy he was glad to be leaving so he didn't have to listen to such a \"Blowhard\" any longer.....but I digress, I would be back for sure, great food, service and value for Vegas.",

The menu's are on the wall, and simple. They start you off with white and red wine included in your meal and garlic bread. Then comes the house salad which is super yumm. I had the chicken alfredo and i must say it's the BEST i have ever had. They finish you off with a cappucino. They even treated the happy couple with a wedding cake after. We were basically finished after this meal because it was a lot, but cannot wait to go back, will never go to Vegas without a stop at Batista's. Oh and got a tid bit from a cabbi, the reason it's named HOLE IN THE WALL  is because back in the day during prohibition they used to have a fake brick wall in the back and when the police would come by they would go through a trap door with thier alcohol. Just had to add it, thought it was a cool story. And Thanks Vito for being the best waiter!!!!",

I found the prices high, the portions small and the food mediocre. If you enjoy looking at black-and-white photographs of dead celebrities who ate there once 50 years ago, then you might enjoy this place. The only thing that keeps it afloat is that it is near the Strip and they get a lot of walk-in traffic. You won't see many locals there, because we know of better restaurants that cost less. If you decide not to order anything, they will charge you $4.50 just to sit at the table.",

Loved the concept of the menu and the minestrone soup was excellent, they dropped one red and one white wine on the table, the girls liked the red and the white was to my liking except I had to drop ice in it as it was room temperature, but since it kept flowing I didn't care. Service was spot on and not intrusive and there was a nice break between the appetizers and main course that allowed the garlic bread (which felt like it was made right in the back) and soup/salad to works its way in a downward direction so that you didn't feel like you had to rush to eat because they wanted your table and your money.  Chicken parm was goooooood, not typically oversized like you find in so many restaurants these days, normal people eat normal meals for one person not 5. Not everything in life needs to be supersized and I think they've found that balance. I'll be back in Vegas in February and will definitely be returning, for the menu and the cost you really can't beat it.",

We were charged an extra $13 for sharing even though we only wanted 1 of everything:(  the pasta was over cooked and the sauce was bland and terrible.  The steak was the worst we have ever had. It tasted like it was made the day before and microwaved before serving it to us.  The wine is cheap crap but even if the best wine was served, it wouldn't make up for the terrible food.  The garlic butter on the bread tasted spoiled.  The ice water that they gave us tasted like sewage water. Needless to say,  I suffered a bad stomach ache.",

Chick Parm arrived with penne and the cream spinach. The portion was large and very good. Spouse had Linguini with white clam sauce. It too was a large portion and good. It was dark inside and had a presence of old Vegas.... Accordion player visited the table and entertained the room for a bit. Perfect! Overall a good place to eat in Vegas for a decent price.

    "text": "I had reservations for over 2 months and last night was the night finally to enjoy the most memorable Italian cuisine since my late mother made. Boy, was I disappointed, she would have rolled over in her grave! First, I must say the atmosphere was very special with all the old pictures of the past stars and super stars that supposedly ventured into this establishment, but that was the ONLY thing that was enjoyable! As soon as the four of us were seated, the fast train began! The wine and bread were on the table in seconds (which I thought was nice for quick service, but I had no idea how fast!) Then the waiter came over to take our order within 5 minutes, not too shabby!  Then the BEST part was the little old iconic man (36 years) came by too sing a song of someone's home town, but he was quickly told to move out of the way by another waiter bringing our food to us! This was within 10 minutes of receiving our salads, which were 5 minutes after our orders were placed. Stay with me now, the best is here! Once we shoveled down our supposed great food prepared in 10 minutes or less with the most bland \"homemade sauce\", the plates were quickly scooped up and our overly sweet cappuccinos were brought (no chance to order anything different) which we tried to enjoy, but the waiter then came and politely told us \"they needed the table and we had to leave!\"  The sad thing was we already paid the bill with a generous tip! If I had known that we would be told to leave because they needed the table and 3 other tables were also empty, I would have left them a tip equal to the quality of the service and food...$1.00! I have been in many places on very busy nights and NEVER told we had to leave to make room!  Maybe they should convert the place to \"take-out\" only, where one could go through the line, look at pictures of how they USED to treat customers, place your order, look at more pics while being serenaded by the gentle little old man in a cage high off the floor (so he's not in the way), pay and pick up our fast food and leave! Now I know why it's called Battista's Hole in the Wall, but a little putty will fill any leak!",

I got the lasagna and my boyfriend got three chicken parm. The lasagna was a good size portion, just enough cheese and meat. I really liked it but it wasn't amazing just good. The chicken parm was pretty thick-not the best way to serve a chicken parm in my opinion. It should have been thinner and easier to eat. It came with cream of spinach and the portion was also really big. You will be full no matter what you get here. Plus the wine is unlimited! The free cappuccino is also awesome don't forget it at the end!!  Will be back the next time I want to be wasted and full.",

For $26, I got home made minestrone soup that was excellent.  There is complimentary red and white wine that my husband enjoyed  (I don't drink wine). I had the ravioli which were cooked perfectly and in a thick, rich tomato sauce. It was served with a very flavorful home made garlic bread. I took home half of the ravioli because I was stuffed. To finish the meal, they save complimentary cappuccino. I would have given 5 stars but the service fell short one our main meal was served. It was nearly impossible to flag down the server after the main course.",

A carafe(s) of wine is included in the set price.. the red is drinkable. For a full dinner at a set price... mine was $26.00 for eggplant parmesana (salad, pasta side dish,  cappuccino).. its  ok. Canned black olives, Kraft type grated parmesan cheese, block mozzarella, slightly overcooked eggplant.. but realize the price and location! That buys you a cocktail in some places nearby. Dinner was edible, service was personal, atmosphere and the ancient accordion player was fun, and the reason to go here once. Fills fast, get a reservation.. that says something in itself.",

It was our friends 30th birthday and they brought out a cold brownie that no staff member would've eaten themselves. Lastly, the food in general was not amazing. I could've had the same quality by buying boxed pasta and sauce in a bottle from a local store. Wouldn't recommend.",

My family didn't really finish any of their food we ended up taking everyone's left overs home so I could give it to my dogs. There's cheaper and higher quality Italian restaurants around or go to the Olive Garden it tastes no different to me.",

We made reservations,  and they held our table till the party was together ( they were late).   The waitress came immediately to the table, introduced herself, then a young waiter came over to the table and brought 2 bottles of wine,  asked us what did want for appetizer,  that was brought out quick, soon after the waitress took our orders, that also came out quick.  Everyone ordered something different, and my daughter is not a meat eater and the food was to made exactly as she ordered it.  The food was delicious, very tasty, fresh, and very well seasoned. Afterwards everyone was full.  A lot of food for your money, and I would recommend this restaurant to all who are looking for a good place to eat, with friends or families.  They can accommodate small group and large groups. We had an enjoyable night.",

We put this place on our itinerary because it was convenient, took reservations, and seemed like a really good deal.   The server was extremely nice and pretty attentive, especially for such a large group. The salad and garlic bread were both pretty good. I wish I had tried the minestrone soup, it looked yummy and my friend seemed to like it. Then my entree came and I was pretty disappointed. I chose the cannelloni with meat and definitely would have preferred something else. There was a weird cream sauce on half of it, luckily the other half had the normal red sauce. Still, the filling wasn't very good and I only ate a little bit of it, opting for more garlic bread to fill me up instead.   Some of the girls did like their food. After trying some of their choices, it was better than mine, but I still wouldn't be likely to recommend Battista's based on the food.   So what about the all you can drink wine? Well...along with everything else, it was mediocre. If we had visited our first night rather than our last, maybe we would have been more into the wine.   Overall, if you're not expecting much, go for it. It doesn't hurt to try once, especially if you're up for drinking a lot of average wine and eating unremarkable Italian food for not a bad price. But if I were you, I'd probably skip it. Sorry Battista's.",

I went with a big group, so I had the chance to see many menu items plated and try more than one dish.  Ambience: Very kitschy and dark, lots of old photos and vintage cans, signs & baskets.  Equal parts fun and tacky.  Drinks: Free bottomless house wine.  Not a drinker, but apparently its passable but no memorable.  Service: not friendly, just efficient.  Not super helpful either.  Salad: (included with the meal) 2 stars, boring, lightly vinaigretted greens with a chunk of cheese and a slice of pastrami.  Garlic Bread: (included) Superb, 4 stars.  Warm, fresh, crispy and soft.  Chicken Alfredo (entree): 3 stars. The sauce was fine, the grilled chicken was good.  Filet Mignon: (entree) 1 star.  I eat steak all the time, this was awful: tasteless, under cooked, & dry.  It's hard to mess up a piece of meat but Battistas has done it.  Almost identical to the memorable time I ordered steak at an Applebee's in 2006.  That bad.  Manicotti: (entree) 2 stars, the cheese was fine, but not much taste, and the sauce was pretty boring, kinda sweet.  Just bland overall.  Cappuccino: (included) was really just hot chocolate with whipped cream.  Good, but not what you expect.  Spumoni Dessert: 3 stars, it was tasty layered ice cream.  Can't mess it up, delicious and recommended.  Tiramisu: overstrong flavor, but it looks pretty.  I can't rate it with justice because I don't like tiramisu.  Most at the table did not eat much of it.",

From the one price for everything including all you can drink cheap wine, to the large portions, and the accordion player from the planet Klepto, there is clearly no other place like it. It never changes. Whether you've visited 20 years ago like I have, or more recently like I have, not one single solitary thing has been altered. You still enter through a weird barrel, the bar is still crazily decorated, and the restaurant itself crams in potentially 100's of people to gorge on Italian American food, wine, and the finest hilarious accordion music in the Western Hemisphere.   No review can do it justice. Try it once. I dare you.",

It's one block away from the strip so we decided to check it out. The atmosphere and old Italian feel is wonderful and feels as if other restaurants have tried to recreate it and have failed.   As for the the food, the menu is very traditional and includes salad/soup and tasty garlic bread plus all you can drink white and red wine, yes please!! I stuck with spaghetti and meatballs and thought it was tasty but not the best I've ever had. My friends felt the same about their meals. I will say the after dinner cappuccino was delightful. The perfect dessert!   Lastly, the accordion player was a very nice touch! He played \"Back home again in Indiana\" for us Indiana girls!",

I was expecting that for a family type restaurant that has been in the city as long as this one has that the customer service would've been better. Sadly, it wasn't.  The waiter came to our table and simply asked \"Soup or salad?\" A member of our table had to remind the waiter that he should greet us first, perhaps maybe even welcome us to Battista's before simply bombarding us with \"Soup or salad?\" But that seemed to be the norm for the place. Nonchalant attitudes from everyone there. Like, they could care less that you were there in the first place.  I'm debating whether to give this place a 1 star, but I have to remind myself it's \"Sunday dinner, at your family's house.\" and sometimes family members have bad days. So I'll give 3 stars because I did enjoy my food.  I just won't be back. There are better places to eat where the patronage is appreciated.",

Menu is fairly simple and it's like a set menu - you choose an entree, and it comes with salad or soup and garlic bread and cappucino to top it off at the end.  Price varies based on what you order.  People love it here because all meals come with bottomless house wine.  The house wine was eh... I mean, if you're a zinfandel type, you may like it though.  The food itself was eh.  There's an accordian player who comes to each table - I swear he's been there since the restaurant opened.  Cute man, but somewhat annoying because he obviously plays for tips.  And while that's okay, if you don't tip him, he literally taps on your shoulder until you give him money.  I think that's pretty inappropriate. Tips are tips.  Not required.

I ordered the same think I ordered last time... Chicken Rio.... He ordered the lasagna....   The chicken was rubber.... I could tell not freshly cooked!!! Waiter came to the table to see how we were and I said, \"not so good\" I told the waiter it was inedible.. He took my plate and that was it.... I shared the mediocre lasagna with my Aussie and left so embarrassed!!! No compensation NOTHING!!  Never going back.... Unless it is free of course...",

Expect to drop about $50 a person with a couple of drinks. Nice mood lighting, cozy and romantic.  The only downside was the waiter.  He was not very accommodating.  He seemed annoyed that we were asking for items we should have already had, like water and bread.  It really took away from the experience.  The history of this place is incredible the pictures the memorabilia. maybe he was having a bad day but when I am paying over 100 dollars for pasta I expect a little more.  maybe he thought we were not going to tip him being younger people ....I don't know. overall it was a good experience because the food and the atmosphere . I can definitely recommend this place. if you go here and have a bad experience with the waiter as I did please yelp it .",

There is an 90yr old man that walks around entertaining people for about 30 seconds with an accordion and he sings. If he's done, he's expecting a tip.",

However, after his suggestion, the wife and I gave it a shot. First, its not the best Italian food in Las Vegas..but it has the best atmosphere by far. When you eat at BHIW you will be taken back to a time when the mafia had more control than the giant corporations. The pictures on the wall include all sorts of famous people, and each little dining area has a bit of a different feel. The menu is basic, and written up on the wall. Dinner is an all inclusive deal, with soup, salad, bread, entree, ALL YOU CARE TO DRINK HOUSE WINE and a cappuccino. The price is higher than other places, but you have to pay a little for the authenticity and proximity to the Strip...as well as the free wine. I've never had anything bad here, and it has become a favorite of my very picky family. The wine isn't the best, but its included! My favorite dish is the manicotti, but I don't dig the spinach that comes with it.   The atmosphere is also improved by a little old Italian man who plays the accordion. For a few dollars he will play you a tune. Some people may think this is creepy, but I think its charming.",

It was one of the worst meals I have eaten. My cousins meal was just as bad. to be fair, we talked to people next to us and they felt the same. We were served our coffee and 10 minutes later, asked to leave because they were closed. Very pricy, value was bad, servicer was o.k. Would never recommend and will not go back.",

If you are looking for a diet-friendly place, this is probably not the place for you (no gluten free or whole wheat pasta) but if you are just looking for a classic Italian place this is the perfect place. Each meal comes with unlimited wine- red and white, soup or salad, garlic bread, and a cappuccino. The environment is really fun and eclectic and the garlic bread was some of the best I've had. The chicken cacciatore I got was just okay but the sausage pasta my step dad ordered was really delicious as well as the eggplant parmesan. Service is really fast, friendly, efficient, and the prices are reasonable for what you get. You will probably have to wait to get a table but it is a Vegas staple and somewhat hidden secret from what I understand. It is a fun and novel place with classic Italian food. It was a fun night! I would give it 3 stars based on the meal I ordered but the overall spirit of the place gives it an extra star.",

Best of all, all you can drink red or white table wine which is pretty good and a great deal.  Followed by a tastey and generously portioned main course.

Loved the old school vibe.  Watched the little accordion player leave while we were in the bar so didn't get to hear him play.  I'm a red wine drinker and love me a bottle on the table, but this stuff was not my favorite, but don't get me wrong unlimited is better than nothing.  I ordered the lasagna and my husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. He wad not impressed, mine was good. They don't have those thick homemade noodles I expect, and my German heritage sauce I make  at home is better than they served. Cappuccino provided would be ok for all kids as its like zero coffee and all sugar.  In the end a dinner with drinks included for $60 in Vegas is cheap, and it's filling. I would give this  place a try for what it is, and it's not: it's old school and been around, it's not in a casino, its a locals favorite. I think for what they offered for food (bread, drinks, wine) I would try it again and find what I really like nextbtime",

I hate Vegas, but I love Battista's.  Gordy serenades you with his accordion stylings, not as late as he used to, but then again, he's about 90 now.  Anyone complaining about the wine on here can always buy a bottle of what they want, but when a place gives you free table wine, I put away my wine snob nose and drink it, and it's not bad at all.  I've paid decent money for wines I've liked less.  The vibe is old Vegas, pictures of celebrities from the Rat Pack days and beyond.  The food is good, very good.  Not Food Channel Celebrity Chef Italian, which most pretentious Vegas posers desire, but good italian food.  You do not leave here hungry.  The garlic bread, soup, salad, all the free sides are good, once again, if you are going to criticize the comps, don't eat them, get something else.  It used to be perfectly priced but the prices have gone up or they would get 5 stars.  This is a place to go if you happen to find yourself in the city of posers and wannabe's.",

Last year the cheese in the salad was real mozzarella but this year it was cheap crinkle cut white cheese.  UGG!    My ravioli was hot but had no flavor.  I tried using salt and the grated cheese to give it some kind of flavor but it was no good.  We were given a booth in a corner and told to sit there.  No one helped pull out the table so we could get behind the table.  We were able to avoid the accordion player but heard others who were not so lucky.  The cappuccino was not even warm.  Heard the people next to us say that even Ragu spaghetti sauce tastes better and we agreed.  We were so looking forward to eating here, but after last week, we will never go back.  I know times are hard,  but where you cut corners by serving inferior food, you are killing your business.  Pretty bad that we had to go out to dinner at another place right after paying the hole in the wall for their \"dinner\".",

Honestly- this place is way over priced and the food not so good. Only good thing going was the decor and the ambiance.  Here's the breakdown: 1. Food way over priced. Yes, you get salad or soup, garlic bread and free red & white wine. But when you're paying min. $21, the main entree better taste good. And it didn't. Granted the portions are HUGE but still not worth if if the food is bad. 2. I ordered the linguini seafood- the seafood part was good but the sauce was bland and tasted too much like tomato paste. The pasta itself was way too al dente.  3. My sister ordered the cheese ravioli- the sauce was also way too bland and there was too much sauce on the dish.  4. For dessert, we sampled the cheesecake- tasted like a frozen cheesecake from a local grocery store.  5. The \"cappucino\" is really not cappucino. It's more like hot chocolate. Also, as an Italian restaurant, the owners should know better- in Italy, cappucino is a breakfast drink. In the evenings, one drinks espresso with or without liquor in it.  6. Nothing special about the salad or the wines. I can definintely say I have had better wines. 7. The guy with the accordion was a little creepy.  I would never recommend this place to anyone other than to walk past it.",

It looked like we had walked into old school Vegas,  I was waiting for The Rat Pack to make an entrance!!   LOL!   Although it was very packed and the wait was an hour (due to NO reservations) on  a Friday night we figured we would get a drink and wait it out.                 The server inside the bar was very quick to take our order and we found a high top to enjoy our drinks and appetizer (fried ravioli) it was ok...  After a little over an hour we were seated at a little table for 2 in a corner next to a party of 4 and another couple behind us it was a little tight but great service and delicious food made up for all of that.    I ordered the Veal Marsala w/ house salad and my partner ordered the Rib Eye w/ the soup.  Both tasted great and there was plenty on our plates.... but the True surprise was the HOUSE WINE that was \"included\" w our dinners !  We expected to have a free glass not a whole carafe of very drinkable red wine! (I joked about taking the wine to-go and we then received a 2nd carafe with  to-go cups/lids)  A very nice cappuccino was served after dinner! (Nice little sweet touch!)    We can't wait to return to Vegas and dine at our NEW favorite spot!!!! Definitely 5 Stars for the great service, ambience and house wine ...did I mention that is INCLUDED!!!  Don't pass up this \"HOLE IN THE WALL\" if you want to experience the good 'ol LAS VEGAS! A True Vegas landmark that holds True to good old fashioned service!!!",

After a long day (flight and game) we came back to the room exhausted and hungry. Couldn't get in until 8:30 but hey at least we got in on a Saturday night. Boy was it worth it. Some of the best Italian home cooked food we've ever had. Even that late at night it was loud and packed, but soon it cleared out and we were able to hear ourselves think. We enjoyed the complimentary table wine with dinner. Atmosphere is what you would expect from an Italian restaurant; it's dark and old world. Excellent food, we still talk about how good it was. Great service.",

The salad was refreshing and the garlic bread fresh and yummy. I like the red wine that was on our table. They give you a small cute glass and you drink whatever you would like to have. They put both a carafe of a red and white wine. Very nice touch.  No doubt next time I am in Las Vegas I will be retuning to my favorite new spot!!  Thanks again Tony for your fabulous service!

    "text": "Eh.....  I was here with a large party about a week ago. This place came highly recommended by people in my group and others. Most of the time, I wouldn't doubt recommendations from multiple sources, but this one just didn't live up to the hype.  While the portions were large, the fettuccine alfredo I had and my BF's spaghetti and meatballs lacked flavor.  In fact, we both said that the dishes we had at Old Spaghetti Factory (which were the same as what we ordered at Battista's) tasted much better.    I am not sure how I feel about the prices. $22 for a soup or salad, large main dish, bread, a side pasta (which kinda didn't make much sense since we were ordering pasta), house wine and cappuccino, seems like a deal. But I only had 3 bites of my salad before I was over it, the bread was ok and my dish lacked flavor. The wines - they gave us both red and wine were decent and the cappuccino were really the only good parts of my meal. However the accordion player was the True highlight.  He's a sweet man with a sharp wit.  I've passed by this place numerous times without knowing it was an Italian restaurant.  It is rather non descript from the outside, but the inside has plenty of charm. I would have never gone had it not been highly recommended and now that I've been, I can't say I would willingly go on my own the next time I'm in town. I love Italian dishes, but this just didn't make the cut.",

The servers are tired in their appearance and their attitude. The reheated entrees bring you back to T.V. dinners on a tray. The lingering after taste of onion and garlic powder stains my tongue 4 hours post dinner.   Despite this it has a uniquely Vegas charm. The goofy objects, menus, and posters on the walls come of a genuinely quirky and not played up. The hostess was proud of her duty to adorn the entrance with her smile.  The house wine - still lovely - so is the mood lighting.  I would go back for drinks. Maybe some calamari. Definitely no entrees.",

    "text": "Vegas is know for being a \"transient\" city, not in a bad way, but that people move in and out and restaurants open and close literally over night. Seriously, living in Las Vegas, you could eat 3 meals, plus 2 snacks a day- everyday for a year and NOT even make a dent in the places available to you.  We lived in Summerlin for a couple of years and Battista's was really a restaurant I enjoyed, we ate here about once a month (maybe twice) and I preferred an early dinner seating. I could go on and on about the decor and cool stuff everywhere, but it's the food I am Yelping and decor is not something you eat. I was just crazy about the garlic bread here, not sure what they do, but I have not found a restaurant that makes it the same way as Battista's, it is delicious and perfect in it's simplicity.   I know it sounds cheesy and all, but dunking this bread into my bowl of Minestrone soup just made me happy, I also asked for the salad because I love my crunchies and the salad here is crisp and tasty. Hubby likes the chicken parm dish and the NY Steak. I am about the veal dishes and the shrimp w/garlic butter, again, soppin' up the sauces with that garlic bread, I couldn't have been happier, except for that the red wine which is included in the meal and lets face it, wine and Italian food just go hand in hand. Service was quick, friendly and attentive and the many times we went when I was pregnant with our daughter (I didn't drink wine), the servers checked on us, but just let us be, to enjoy our dinner together.  I have sent many friends here to have dinner when they visit Vegas and it is definitely where I go for a first meal when I am visiting.  Don't change a thing Battista's you are perfect just as you are.",

We walked in late around 9:00pm on a Monday night and were seated right away. Free red and white house wine with every meal. Traditional Italian meals. There are no menus, only plaques along the wall listing the core  dishes. It's a very cool, dark, eclectic, old school monster, lounge, Vegas vibe.  It's fun to look at the various pics of celebrities along the wall.  If you love lasagna, this is the place to order it. Meaty and cheesy and a big serving. My husband ordered the cioppino and the seafood was fresh and piled high.  The garlic bread was soft, buttery and real garlic cloves. I do not drink coffee. It smells great, I just never acquired a taste for it. They serve a complementary cappuccino at the end of each meal heaped up with whipped cream. I had to try it. I could taste a hint of coffee, but it was faint. I drank the whole thing! It was almost a dessert in and of itself.",

It was a Friday night and had made reservations the night before. We were promptly seated (make sure everyone is there in your party) and ordered cocktails from the bar. They began with huge pieces of garlic bread, your choice of soup or salad (hard to argue about either). The main dishes come out in perfect timing.   There may be better Italian restaurants on the strip, but if you like Italian-American with huge servings and very affordable prices, this is the place to go. Free table wine, huge servings and tasty food make this place a no brainier.",

Took about 40 minutes to get seated.  Our server was very nice and she helped get the food out quickly as we had a show to see.  The linguine and clams in white sauce was very good (although they offer it in red sauce as well, which seems odd to me) and full of tender bits of clams. The garlic bread that comes with the meal was also excellent. None of the table were real wine drinkers so the wine sadly went mostly untouched. It would be nice to opt out of the table wine.  The minestrone soup was just ok.  Really loved the atmosphere and decor here - very kitschy, lots of celebrity pics on the walls. I love old style family Italian restaurants, and this place delivered!",

Bloated prices and quite frankly mediocre food have reduced what was once a must see for visitors to a place to avoid.  Even the portions are shrinking.  We started with the garlic bread which was stale and had almost no garlic flavor.  The salad was what i call a lazy salad.  It was essentially lettuce and some fillers and instead of shredding or chopping the cheese and unidentifiable salami like substance, they simply put a block of cheese on the salad and one round piece of salami.  Clearly a chef who takes no pride in what leaves the kitchen.  The kids got a small bowl of ravioli for 13.95 which was boring.  The adult menu starts at 24.95 with a high price over $30.00. I tried the chicken parm.  It was ok but the chicken was not moist and the sauce watery.  The side of ziti was  flavorless.  The spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the meatballs were overly dense.    All in all a disappointing meal.  I used to recommend this place to out of town guests but no longer.  It also appears that they raised their prices when the High Roller arrived which makes this place no longer an affordable value.",

She advised us of an hour wait since we didn't have a reservation so we decided to put our names on the list and have a drink at the bar.  The place was not busy, in my opinion. A few people at the bar and what looked like several open tables. I decided to check <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> just for kicks. I was super surprised to see 6:00pm available as accepting reservations.  What the heck, why not? I filled out the reservation request and it confirmed us as having a reservation for 2 @ 6pm.  My husband approached the hostess at 550 to \"check in\" for our reservation. Immediately, they brought us to \"our table\". Seriously? The hostess was beyond annoyed. I've got a hungry husband, don't think I'm beyond using my OpenTable expertise to our advantage.  Our server Ryan was very sweet and efficient, even when his section was bustling.  Husband ordered spaghetti with meat sauce. Holy herbs and spices! A little overboard but still edible, I suppose. I ordered cheese manicotti. It was definitely only \"okay\". Very bland- a vast difference from the overwhelming flavor (and not in a great way) of the spaghetti.  So what was good? Can't go wrong with three free wine!  In all seriousness, the bread was delicious, as was Husband's salad and the to-die-for cappuccino.  Will we be back? Sure. But we'll make reservations first :)",

We thought the point of making a reservation was that you didn't have to wait for a table. Nbd, restaurants get busy and tables don't always leave when you need them to. Next, I take my first sip of the fabled bottomless wine. I can only describe the taste as a combination of the cheapest jug wine mixed with grape juice - not only sweet but also dimensionless and nearly non alcoholic. I try both red and white, they are identical. We order and the meal gets under way.  Salad=overdressed lettuce, single huge slice of salami, single solid chunk of mystery white cheese, intermittent shaved carrots/cherry tomato/olive. Entrees=too salty and acidic tomato sauces with no other flavor, boiled chicken that is also overcooked and tough, and vegetables that have been accompanied by a healthy portion of water onto my plate. After dinner cappucino=we paid before we could experience any more. We will never get those 50 minutes of our lives back. If you want to pay Maggiano's prices for food quality less than my undergraduate cafeteria, giddy-up. Otherwise, eat somewhere else.",

After a couple days of punishing my liver, we saw this place and as soon as I saw the sign, I craved spaghetti for the next 2 days.  Food- Like my tip said, unlimited red AND white wine at your dinner. Challenge accepted [insert meme]. The food was really good, not great but definitely good. The meal also came with a salad or soup which was good size. I didn't eat all my meal I think because I tried so hard to drink the wine.   Service- Not bad, but not good either. About run of the mill. We called earlier in the day for a reservation and we still had to wait 10 minutes? This place on a Tuesday night wasn't even busy?  It's decorated like a buca di peppo and has celebrities on the wall. Anyway, I felt that because of the wine and the value/size of the meal it deserved 5 stars. Possibly 4.5 because the service wasn't so great, but anyhoo, lots of fun.",

It is a kitschy place, where every square inch is covered by either a photo of a celebrity, a cluster of plastic grapes on a trellis or a drippy candle in a wine bottle. Even before you walk through the front \"barrel\" door (built to resemble half a large wine cask), you are greeted by aroma of garlic and other fine Italian fare.  It is always busy here....reservations are recommended, especially for a big party. If you don't have reservations, be prepared to wait. (They do have a full bar though, and there is plenty of seating).  Now to the food.....the food varies from various pasta dishes to chicken marsala/parmigan, veal, steak pizziola, fillet mignon, etc. All dinners come with either soup or minestrone soup, a pasta side, all-you-can drink house wine (red or white) and a cappachino for desert. (which is unbelievable.) Maybe my palate gets more sophisticated the older I get, but I used to think that Battista's had excellent food....now I can honestly say, it is just good.   All in all, I can say that if you have never been to Battista's, you have to at least try it once and then make the judgement call yourself. It definitely is a fun place and a little piece of LV history.  Highlights: Great atmosphere, all you can drink house wine, minestrone, garlic bread, after dinner desert cappachino.",

    "text": "The atypical Italian Restaurant, huge portions, wine, checkered tablecloths, wine bottle centerpiece holding a candle.   When last in Vegas, my friend John had said he came here a few years earlier and raved about the white clam sauce. He mentioned at least a pound of succulent little morsels of clams over a full pound of linguini. It was our last night in Vegas, and frankly, I was sick of buffets.  We arrived, and if I hadn't been shown how to find this place I would have never found it, It literally is a hole in the wall. But when you enter the place is a full sized eatery. It's like Bucca De Beppo without the clutter.   Our waiter arrived just seconds after being seated, dressed in black pants and a white shirt, slicked back hair, looking around, all the waiters looked like clones of each other. With him were two carafes of wine, red and white. Then he expertly explained the daily specials, including an eggplant lasagna that sounded amazing. But I had my heart set on this amazing linguini with white clam sauce. John ordered the eggplant lasagna, and I ordered the Linguini, and we said we'd share since the portions were so huge. John also got a meatball.  We sat a bit talking about our success at the blackjack table and how we were always so close on the Roulette table. I had a good day at the sports book, picking the Steelers over the Browns (duh) and picking the rams and teasing them with Buffalo. So yeah, I was picking up the tab. Not bad wine for being free. Garlic bread was delivered, nice and cheesy, garlic out the wahzoo! Very good indeed.  Our waiter arrived with two HUGE, oversized bowls, one containing my linguini, the other the eggplant lasagna. and two smaller plates for us to share. (no extra charge for sharing!) Can I say I come from a big Italian family, I saw my father eat healthy amounts of pasta at one setting, but I had never seen a bowl of linguini with clams as big as this for one person. I even said to the waiter \"are you sure this is mine and not for a table of four?\" He assured me this was a single serving. I swear it was over a pound of pasta and a pound of clams. Fresh grated Ramono cheese was dusted over the top, and plenty of cracked pepper. He even left the cheese grater and a healthy block of cheese at the table for us to help ourselves.  The pasta was perfectly al dente, a bit of bite and wonderful flavor from the clams. The clams were very tender, meaty and succulent. John's Eggplant Lasagna was very dense, flavorful, but a bit greasy from frying the eggplant. There was a lot of different cheeses used, I could taste ricotta, Parm, Romano, and a smokey cheese, maybe Provolone? Aside from the grease, it was delicious, rich and tasty. The meatball was very dense, stuffed with all kinds of fresh herbs and garlic. It was easily six ounces.  Battista's is a great place in a great city, after you've had your fill of buffets and quick bites, go have a wonderful sit down meal at an Italian restaurant that does it right.",

We didn't drink that either.    MD 20/20 is like fine champagne compared to the swill served here.  Even the garlic bread was awful. I'll bet if I went in the kitchen, I'd find a brown plastic container of Country Crock. 2 molecules from being plastic.   The mob would be insulted to have people think they own this. Never mind the mob has been run out of town 20+ years ago.   The prices are outrageous for this garbage food. Yeah, its a tourist trap.  I heard RC farms rejected the leftovers from this dump. Pigs have standards too.  Elvis, Frank & Dino were eating at Golden Steer, Neros, and what is now Piero's. I could buy old photos of them & hang in my kitchen too. Claiming I cooked for them.",

The service was very slow, not very attentive, but nice, polite, and engaging. The main course was horrible. We had veal Marsala and veal Parmesan. The Marsala was so bitter, it tasted like it was cooked in grain alcohol, couldn't finish the meal. The Parmesan was flavorless. The olive garden has much better food. I can't understand why the place was so full. Free wine???",

    "text": "We held our post-wedding dinner here in June for about 25 people, and after worrying a bit because we were planning this from across the country and had never been to Battista's, they knocked it out of the park!    It was perfect!  We had a reservation from 6-8 and because of the photos taking longer than expected, the bride and groom did not arrive until almost 7.  The wedding party hung out in the bar until then (and were having a blast I might add), and they seated us and extended our reservation with no problem.  Service was perfect, the food was great, and the night could not have been better!  We even got a few songs by the guy on the accordian, and an ovation by the entire restaurant when my bride and I walked in!  Simply great, and we will DEFINITELY return on our next trip to Vegas!  Thank you to a few of the reviewers on here who I spoke with about this place!",

The meal was 21 dollars (one of the cheaper ones, be wary), but came with a salad, garlic bread, and unlimited house wine (!!!) included.  Oh and a cup of cappuccino after dinner, which usually isn't my thing but tasted more like liquid nutella than anything else.  Battista's has become the romantic dinner spot my girlfriend and I head to whenever in Vegas.  Be warned, it takes about 2 hours to eat dinner, so don't be planning on going anywhere fast.  Personally I loved having the time to talk, but the people at the next table over we pissed.  So just a friendly warning.",

The meals come with complimentary all you can drink house red or white wine, which makes the prices very affordable if you're a wine drinker. At the end of the meal, they serve complimentary espresso, which is to die for! On top of it all, there is this adorable little old Italian man that walks around and serenades for tips, of course. This place has been around for years for a reason! It's a must on the Vegas list.",

    "text": "I feel so sorry for people that come here as a tourist or with out of town guests.  Folks, this is as bad as it gets.    Living in Las Vegas I can deal with having a crappy restaurant experience and paying too much because sometimes you just don't know or have a choice.  Unfortunately, I had never been here and had a couple of out of town guests who googled Italian food on their phone and this one popped up and was close to their hotel.  I tried to steer them away from this place as restaurants on or near the strip are usually incredibly overpriced and the food is usually at best mediocre.   Well my attempt at steering them to a known commodity did not work.  Battista's it was.  I'm not going to get into details on this place as they have been discussed ad nauseum on Yelp.  The food in this place is not only unpalatable but is probably dangerous.  Chemical tasting food that I can picture being cooked up in large tubs in the back is what this place serves.  The 'wine' they serve is not quite up to the same quality someone on food stamps would buy to use as cooking wine.  Don't get me wrong I don't mind cheap wine but this stuff was not fit to be consumed by humans.  To top it all off they serve a Nescafe Corn Syrupy type chocolate drink at the end.  This place has a cozy ambiance according to other review but that's where the positives end.  This place preys on unsuspecting tourists who don't know any better until it's too late.  I can't imagine anyone ever going back to this place.  This place treats its customers like cattle, well, maybe worse actually.  They could care less about your experience and possible return business since they are located in a spot that see's a few million new visitors each year.  This restaurant wouldn't last 3 months in another city that must rely on return customers and positive word of mouth.  Please people do not go to this awful place with these awful people.  This restaurant represents everything that is wrong with the Las Vegas dining scene.",

After being seated we were told there is 13$ cover charge  for splitting a 26$ meal even after we said we would be getting desert as well which would bring the bill to well over 13$/person.

    "text": "I am going to preface this review by saying that I really hate to give bad reviews and that I review places no matter what my experience was.  I live in Vegas, so I have passed by this place more than once. I never actually heard if it was good or not, and never bothered to try it out.  This past weekend, my aunt and her friends were in town and one of them likes this place and made a reservation for us to eat there before seeing a show.  I had the option of joining them for dinner or just meeting them at the show...well, I wish I would have just skipped dinner at this place and gone to the show.  I love Italian food and grew up with real Italian food being cooked by my grandmother. I really have no idea how some people are giving this place 5 stars.  I was really confused at the menu--it's posted up on the wall and I had to crane my neck to look at it from my seat so I just settled on spaghetti and meatballs. The meal comes with a side salad, wine, garlic bread, your entree, and a cappuccino. The wine was not that good. But I figured since it was included in the price. The white tasted something like grape juice and the red seemed watered down.  The salad actually made me laugh---1 grape tomato, 1 black olive, 1 piece of salami, 1 chunk (yes, chunk) of cheese, mixed greens, and to be honest, I'm not sure if there was any dressing on it or not. The bread was okay, nothing special but it was more like slices of toast than what you normally get at a restaurant for garlic bread. When I got my spaghetti and meatballs, I was disappointed to say the least. The sauce was bland--needed garlic and more seasonings. The meatballs left something to be desired. I got spaghetti and meatballs because it is such a fail-safe dish. I honestly make better spaghetti and meatballs myself. I make my sauce, pasta, and meatballs all from scratch so I know it can be done and be good. This tasted like a TV dinner. Lastly, the cappuccino. I don't normally drink cappuccinos, so I will be honest and say that I might not be the best critic of this part of the meal, but I feel like it tasted like it came from a mix. It was overly sweet and for some reason made me think of Honey Maid graham crackers.  Also, during our meal Gollum (perfect description by reviewer below) did come over to play the accordion for us which was more annoying than anything and I did my best not to laugh. Overall, I wish I just passed on this place and if I want Italian food I will either just make it myself or find a better place even if it is a chain restaurant (sadly, most chains I can think of would have been a better bet).",

The free wine and bread is nice. Also, Love the little old man playing accordian. Funny guy and he can probably play anything you ask on the accordian. For us, since we are all from Indiana, he played \"Back home again in Indiana\" which if you know anything about the Indy 500 or Indiana, is a little piece of Hoosier tradition. Cracks me up that my step dad said he has been coming to Vegas for probably 25-30 years and it is the same little old guy playing accordian.",

Service is OK, they are what they need to be.   With regard to the food, they have a very straightforward menu and the meals include the salad and their amazing bread, as well as the weird cappuccino, which is mostly Swiss Miss hot chocolate. The kitchen is workman-like. They obviously know how to crank this stuff out in the kitchen, but I've been there many times and have always enjoyed what they put on the plate.   The food quality and taste is comparable to a chain like the Spaghetti Factory or Buca de Beppo. The atmosphere bumps it up a star, for me.",

This is not the best italian food, I don't even think it's quite as good as Olive Garden.    The salad was good.  My boyfriend hates salad so he had the minestrone.  I didn't try it but he said it was good.  Both our entrees (lasagna, chicken parmesan) were fine, but nothing to write home (or a yelp review?) about.  The bread was pretty good.  \"Cappucino\" or as other reviewers have correctly identified it - Swiss Miss was not hot... not even warm actually.  I guess they fill the mugs in large batches?  How hard is it to pour a cup when it's time to serve it?    We went through a carafe of the white and a glass or two of red before hitting the dusty trail back to Bill's Gamblin Hall.  Anyway, I like this place... but come on - $22 for lasagna and $26 for chicken parm?  Who are they kidding?  I'd rather pay a more reasonable fee (knock off $10) and then pay a separate price for all you can drink wine.  Because if you don't intend to drink the wine **Read** you are wasting your money.  Wish I could give 2 1/2 but I'm rounding up to 3 for the ambiance.  Very cool :)",

The minestrone was tasty, and the italian salad was fresh. I decided to try the special for the day - veal osso bucco.

Having just been in NY a couple of weeks before, I was looking forward to seeing how the food compared to by Patsy's Italian Restaurant NY experience which was amazing! I have to say, it really didn't compare. The free red wine was not good at all. It had a vinegar taste. No one at the table liked it. I didn't get to try the white though. I ordered lasagna which the waiter said he thought was the best thing on the menu. I have to say...it was pretty delicious. The side of meatballs I got were average. No one else was thrilled with their main dishes either. The meals where a good size, so if you're not ravenously hungry, I suggest splitting a meal ($10 fee) with a side of meatballs or sausage.",

If you are looking for high end Italian, skip Battista's. But  if you would like an real old time Vegas experience at a reasonable (for the strip) price then give it a go. Positives...ambiance......  place is filled with an enormous amount of Vegas / celebrity memorabilia. Just sitting and looking around was an entertainment event all by itself. Service was excellent and the house wine (FREE!!)  ((Yes I said FREE!!!)) is surprisingly decent. You get garlic bread (OK) and a choice of soup (minestrone) or salad, We had the soup and it was good.Negatives......  Entrees were...pedantic.  I had the veal piccante and my wife had fettuccine with chicken. My veal was a little tough and the portion was small. My wife's chicken was certainly \"cooked\" and very dead...No juice was saved in the killing of this fowl. :-)  Still full meal on the strip for two with unlimited wine for less that $75 including tip has value. The ambiance is really worth the trip as well. I guess my recommendation is if the old Vegas experience is on your bucket list   Then please enjoy. If you are looking fro excellent Italian food...ehh maybe move on",

    "text": "Long Long ago Battista's used to be one of the Better Italian Restaurants in Vegas. It has now taken over as the WORST Italian Restaurant in Vegas (knocking Capo's to second worst). I can't imagine that Battista or Desi or any of the Battista family member have anything to do with it anymore because of how terrible it is.   It has expanded over the years and still has the look and charm of its better days. The hostess doormen are friendly. \"The future is in your hands\" sign next to the mens urinals is still there. I took a friend here that has never been but always wanted to try it. I hadn't tried it for 7 years so I was happy to revisit again with my BFF. I remember 7 years ago, the food was going down hill and was average at best, but everyplace deserve a second change and especially since it had been so long.   It was just the 2 of us and we were seated shortly after our 7pm reservation in the section to the back left as you face the kitchen.  The meal comes with your choice or Minestrone soup or salad, garlic bread, wine  with whatever dish you order. The wine is in large carafes on the table when you are seated. 1 is white the other a red blend. It comes with the 3 ounce glass. The wine is drinkable but its basically church wine.Even though I'm not usually a white wine fan the white was better than the red. Shortly after our server Brittney came over explained how the ordering and options work and took our orders. We both chose the Minestrone soup. I was split between that or a salad but on Brittney's suggestion I chose the soup. The soup comes out fairly quicklyand took the first sip...It's FRIGGEN' Progresso Minestrone or canned stuff for sure. It was closer to luke warm than hot but I eat about 3/4 the soup since I was starving. Its not that the soup is bad it just not good and canned soup is never okay to serve without at least doctoring it up.  I was unimpressed but so far not bad just not good. The garlic bread comes out and it was the highlight of the meal. It is probably the frozen garlic  hated as the consistency was not fresh baked or from a bakery at all. The pre perforated slices were a give away too. It was  fairly good though. We both order the Cheese Ravioli. They give you quite a few Ravioli unlike most that give you 5 or 6 at most you get twice that here. Unfortunately just like the rest of the food, it was just frozen Ravioli heated up and covered it what was most likely Ragu or some jarred garbage sauce. There was nothing home made tasting about the entire meal. Asked if we wanted the Cappuccino at the end , I couldn't stomach it after the disappointment of what I was put through the rest of the meal.   The highlight was the service and the original decorations/pictures hanging everywhere.  Brittney was a sexy, attentive and good server.  The busser was also quite good and of course the accordion player who was built with the place.  Even with the service and atmosphere pluses I can't give Battista's any more than 1 star because the food does a disservice to Italian food and now Las Vegas. They exist now solely to trick the poor tourists into buying crappy food and cheap wine making them believe it is a deal. They need to close up shop or if they want to stay in business move shop to the Circus Circus Buffet.  I can't believe the Locatelli's would have anything to do with Battista's anymore and they just handle the real estate they own around the Valley now. That's what I believe at least.",

Food isn't anything to write home about but the value is sure there.  The wine isn't the best but... they give you lots of it.  Overall, it felt like something out of another time and we couldn't help but have a good time with it.  Not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination but lighting fast service, good portions and I certainly ate my portion up so have to say the food was enjoyable too.",

An older woman (Linda) was bartending and acted like she would rather be anywhere but there. Grown men actually admitted they were scared to flag her down or call her over. When I asked for a drink menu she said they didn't have one, then a few moments later produced a beer and wine menu which is what I wanted. The wine I ordered (a Riesling) was good and so were the toasted ravioli. It was 1.5 hours wait to be seated. Then I ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce and my husband ordered a steak dish. My spaghetti was horrible and bland, as was my husband's dish. I will say the salad, minestrone soup and table wine were fine. But for the price we paid, I would not recommend this place.",

Let me say that again; I was in bed by midnight on a Friday in VEGAS because I felt like an ewok was clawing its way out of my stomach. Blasphemy! I should have been sick from drinking too much tequila out of a stripper's bellybutton but no! You ruined that, Battista. There was no bellybutton tequila for me that night.  I hope you liked the taste of the tears you made me shed. I'm sure they were better than your ravioli and wine that tasted like homeless children had been washing their feet in it.",

It isn't the Olive Garden, so don't expect some sort of chain restaurant trying to go over the top with flavorful, catchy sounding entree's that really aren't Italian.

Each meal comes with a minestrone soup (so good) or a salad; your entree; and a cappuccino (tasted like watered down hot chocolate) for dessert.

But I was dressed up, and did not want to be greasy at the theater. -Service, fast, friendly and efficient -The end of the meal, sweet and spicy, coffee whipped creamy thing they serve. HELL YES!

    "text": "Just a hop, skip, and a drunken amble off the Strip, Battista's was an unexpected delight. From the outside, it looks like a sleazy bar, maybe an extension of the liquor store next door. The inside looks like a low-rent version of Buca di Beppo, walls cluttered with photos and inscrutable memorabilia. I was worried that the food would taste like Buca, but my fears were assuaged.   They start you off with the \"free\" wine and tiny glasses; my large party had carafes of white and red. The white was perfectly pleasant \"chablis,\" and though I didn't sample the \"burgundy,\" my companions pronounced it to be nearly palatable.  Then the garlic bread appeared. Like an idiot, I gorged myself on it. It was quintessential - fluffy but chewy, loaded with salty garlic-ness.   The minestrone soup (also included) tasted fine, though the base was a bit gummy. Most of my tablemates opted for the salad - I just do not understand.  By the time my lasagna arrived, big as a brick and covered in molten cheese, I was so full I could only take two bites. But man, was it good!   The food is very straightforward, American-style Italian, cooked to generally pleasing textures. Very appetizing stuff. So good that I took several more bites of lasagna than I should have.   To cap the night, they offer you this little mug of cappuccino topped with whipped cream. Honestly, it tasted like hot cocoa, which is fine by me!  The prices were outrageous, of course, this being just off the Las Vegas Strip. At $25, my lasagna was one of the cheaper entrees on the board. But considering the extras, the large portion sizes, and the appealing renditions of American-Italian classics, I'd say it's worth a shot.",

Delicious red sauce. I am totally snobby and usually don't eat anyone's sauce outside the family but I would eat here once a week if I lived here.",

We only found it when  we were at \"Tickets for Tonight\" getting tickets for Blue Man Group when the ticket agent asked where we planned to eat that night and if he could interest us in a discounted meal someplace. My wife was in the mood for Italian and none of their discounts were for an Italian restaurant. Instead, he told us we should go check out Battista's if we wanted a really great Italian meal. We went that night and have been going back every time were in town ever since. From the moment you step inside until the moment you leave it feels like you've entered a cozy restaurant in Italy.  The food is great! The all you can drink red or white house wine is pretty tasty. It's a multi-course meal finished off with a cappuccino. I highly recommend it to everyone who visits Vegas and wants a great meal experience.",

After your meal, they also serve cappuccino. It was very tasty. I love the \"hole in the wall\" ambience and decor. They even have the menu up on the wall lol. Overall it was a nice experience.",

    "text": "Ahh good old Battista's off the strip!  This place is just a Las Vegas legend and will take you back to the Rat Pack days of Old School Las Vegas.  I have been coming here once a year or more for almost 20 years and it never changes.  Ever.  This is a good thing.  Prices really aren't that bad for what you get especially when you look at many other choices in Vegas.  I just have to laugh and shake my head when I see bad reviews of this fun little place.  Oh boo hoo the wine isn't top shelf, the waiter took too long, the prices are too high.  Seriously?  Take the stick out of your ass, try to smile and enjoy this gem of a restaurant for what it is.  It is a legendary, fun, kitschy, classic old Italian restaurant that isn't trying to be something it's not.  Relax, and take some time to look at all the decor and pictures on the walls.  Everyone from Elvis to Ol' Blue eyes to Liberace and everyone in between has eaten here.  That's just cool old school.  Soak in the ambiance and the low lighting,  Get tipsy with the free wine.  Yes, the 2 full carafe's of both red and white wine and the bread is FREE.  The dinner is standard Italian fare and is always delicious if not predictable.  The bread is always fresh and the bring you a nice cappuccino to complete your meal.    The very best part of eating at Battista's however is Gordy.  This 90+ years young gentleman is the salt of the earth.  He will play you a song on his accordion that will make you smile every time, guaranteed.   Wearing a baseball cap?  He will play take me out to the ballgame.  Feeling romantic, he will play That's Amore.  Wonderful man and a treasure in Las Vegas.",

More than enough food for one person, but keep in mind that if you split a dish, you will be charged for the dish plus an additional $13 to cover the additional salad/bread/wine. The garlic bread is delish! I got the chicken parmigiana, which was great, but would be interested to try the chicken rio next time. Good for large groups, but make a reservation. Bring cash or be prepared to Venmo your pals, as they only accept one card per table. The accordion player played \"Deep in the Heart of Texas\" for us Dallas folks, much to our drunken delight.",

Gordy greeted our table with an accordion and a smile to light up any room! The staff were all friendly and prompt. He atmosphere is fantastic.

I've NEVER had worse food, of ANY kind, ANYWHERE. We didn't have high expectations, on account of the limitless, free wine, but the wine is cheap and awful. You couldn't drink enough to make up for the cost of the potentially lethal food. I guess their food is always terrible, because the waitstaff cleared our full plates, without question. I might have complained, if we hadn't all been so desperate to get out of there. P.S. Should you ever have the misfortune of being dragged there, don't bother staying for the \"cappuccino\". It is basically powdered hot chocolate made with water.",

We welcomed the bottomless house wine with open arms/mouths. My sister was right in stating, \"The bread isn't even that great, but I can't stop eating it!\" Ha! It was definitely more delicious when we scooped sauce up with it. :) My sister and I split the eggplant parm. It was pretty good. The reality is we spent the ENTIRE day walking. I mean seriously, we walked miles that day. So much sightseeing and getting from place to place. That's the best time to visit Battista's. The atmosphere is chill and you can eat and drink and talk. For some reason the waitresses rushed us when they still had about an hour before closing. But we took our time with dessert and drinking more wine. :) The cannoli was my favorite part!! We were told to make a reservation in advance, but a party of 3 came in without one and was seated within 5 minutes. I assume weekends are crazier than a weekday [when we went].",

Walking up to the restaurant, it was good to see that they still have a doorman that welcomes you inside...a nice touch. Once inside, it was pleasant to see that it literally has not changed ONE bit since I last ate there however many years prior. It's still extremely dark and the walls are covered with a plethora of random memorabilia.   A polite older woman at the hostess station greeted us and we only had to wait five minutes or so before we were taken to our table. The waiter promptly came up to the table and took our drink order, and the drinks were out in a flash (along with the complimentary wine).   The next items that came out were a basket of garlic bread, an Italian Salad for myself and a minestrone soup for my date. We both LOVED the garlic bread...it was extremely soft and very tasty. The salad was pretty good and she loved the Minestrone.  As for our entrees, she ordered the Lasagna, and I had a New York Steak with a side of Ziti and Marinara sauce. She thoroughly enjoyed her dish, and I thought mine was decent. The steak was a little on the bland side, and the sauce that accompanied the pasta wasn't too great.  The desserts we had were excellent though. First, we had the cappuccino that comes as a part of the meal...and in addition, we had the cannolis. They were quite delicious, though not the best we've ever had.  This is a great place for a romantic evening, and it's not too terribly priced. You can expect to spend around $25-30 a person, but you have to figure in the unlimited wine as well as the salad/soup, garlic bread and cappuccino.",

My lasagna was good and I enjoyed the white wine (though I've read others may not care for it here in the Yelp reviews...) With two carafes on the table, you've got your choice.

The inside of this place is totally kitsch and slightly cheesy, but I loved it. There is a fixed menu, everyone picks their entree and that includes salad and bread and among other things.... all the wine you can drink. The red wine was great! Not the best wine I've ever had, it tasted like sort of a cheap chianti. My salad was very tasty, and the cheese ravioli I had were good, but I liked my companion's dishes better. They treated our birthday guest to a great little song and dessert, and we had a blast laughing and talking with the tables around us.

If you want free wine, fun decor, an accordion player that plays at your table and food like your Italian grandmother used to make, then come here.  I got the Chicken Cacciatore and it was better than some other fancy places I've been to. I can't say I love the Marinara, which came with my boyfriends Veal Parmesan (it's on the sweet side), but it wasn't bad.  You start off with a basket of hot buttery garlic bread, followed up with a big bowl of Italian salad with their excellent house Italian dressing (or Minestrone soup if you want it) and then you get your meal.   I did think the plates were a little small... I would have loved more pasta to use with that delicious Cacciatore sauce.  Your meal is followed up with a hot chocolate-esque flavored Cappucino. By this point you would have realized you're not getting Starbucks here.  Gordy the accordion player comes to every table and asks you where you're from. Then he'll hit a few keys and attempt a song related to your state. Ask him to play more and he will, just don't forget to tip!   I only had the red wine, but for free wine, it's not half bad!  This place really reminded me of my Italian grandmother and the food she used to cook up every Sunday. I'd take that over a $200 meal at some posh Italian joint anyday. Our flight got canceled and we already plan to go back before we leave.",

I've been to plenty of restaurants and paid $30 for one piece is salmon and it was the best salmon I've ever had in my life!! This place needs to be more about quality instead of quantity.  I've been to many Italians restaurants in different areas of the US and this was by far the worst!

Service isn't their best attribute but over all good and again a great price. House wine sucks but hey its included with your meal so you Dont have to feel guilty not drinking it. Skip the cappuccino but say yes to the salad they offer and chicken parm! Yum!",

    "text": "I was a bit nervous before visiting Battista's because it seems like people either really love it, or really really hate it.  We ate dinner here on New Years Eve, and one of the main reasons for doing so was its proximity to where we were staying at the Flamingo. It is an easy 10 minute walk from the back of the Flamingo over to Battista's.  All of the staff were friendly and the unlimited wine is certainly nice. I had my own carafe of red wine and my wife had her own of white. It is not great wine, but it is unlimited.  The food is pretty good, but the prices are a bit high, even with the unlimited wine. The other thing stuck in my mind from our visit was the proximity of the tables to each other. We could hear the entire conversation of the couple at the table across from us.",

    "text": "PLEASE READ, DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!  Just for the record, I have been working in the restaurant industry for several years from Michelin rated to casual. Therefore, I know good food, and bad food, when I see it.  Battista's Hole in the Wall is the absolute worst restaurant I have ever been to. Listed below are all the reasons why:  1. The Hostesses. All the hostesses were cold and unfriendly. Did not smile or welcome us. When asked to be seated they told us we had to have our whole party there (understandable for large parties) but we were a party of 4, 2 of us were there. When asked to see a menu, they handed us a paper menu with ZERO descriptions and when asked about the descriptions, they informed us that our server would inform us.  1. The Server. When seated the was extremely clueless. He asked us several times if we had any questions, yet when we asked him questions he did not know. We asked him to explain the menu, and he pointed to the menu on the wall and told us to look at it. When asked what beers there were he told us all kinds, then only mentioned 2. He was very un attentive and took forever to do anything.   3. According player. As you \"enjoy complimentary\" soup/salad and bread, Gollum from The Lord of the Rings comes to your table and tells you (not asks) to play your party a song. Then, he awkwardly stands there until you reluctantly reach into your pocket/purse to give him a tip.   4. The Food. The food was awful. The dishes are pre-made ($25+) meals which are extremely unappetizing. Literally, they tasted like TV dinners. We had Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Parmesan, and Beef Ravioli. Everyone hated they're dishes.  5. Cover Charge. Considering I hated my meal, I returned it to the server assuming he would take it off the check. He did not. Only after requesting it's removal, the check is returned with a \"cover charge.\" He did not tell us what this was and when asked, he informed us that \"when someone doesn't order a dish a cover charge is done to cover the \"included\" soup/salad/bread. In my case since I sent my dish back, they decided to charge me $12 for their awful starters.    From start to finish I had the absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and left hungry. Please do not waste your time/money on this place. I would give it no stars if I could. At this rate, Battista's will surely go out of business.",

He said it was really good, however he felt the price was a little high for the portions, but it is Vegas so that's expected. I think everything sorta balanced itself out price wise. I mean you do get complimentary wine and amazing garlic bread. I got spaghetti and meat balls, I like to keep things simple. For me the sauce lacked flavor, but it wasn't terrible. Overall I was pretty happy with the place. There was an adorable older gentleman playing the accordion and singing songs,  that was pretty cute.  We stayed at the Flamingo. So it was an easy walk for us, since it was located right behind the Flamingo. We made a reservation online for an 8:30 spot but they were able to move us to an earlier time, since we only had 2 in our party, so that was really nice of them.",

We always enjoy this old school type restaurant that offers some pretty darn good Italian food. People on here that say it's frozen stuff from some Supermarket are just over zealous morons. Anybody who says this is not authentic Italian food is just comparing it some sort of chain restaurant that I don't enjoy. I had the cannelloni with meat and my wife had the veal marsala and the veal was very good. It also included garlic bread a soup or salad and cuppocino . It came with complimentary wine which was not a hundred dollar bottle of wine but it was still pretty darn good and very rare to have it included. That is why I like these old school restaurants the way it used to be. It is not all that expensive if you figure what you get for the price of their dinners. Anybody under 30 should probably forget about coming to this place they don't know too much. I am not an elite yelper so I don't meet the criteria for kissing butt. But I know good food.",

All meals include fantastic garlic bread, unlimited wine, appetizer (soup or salad), and cappucino at the end. We had lasagna (fantastic), veal parmigiana, and canneloni. Alot of food - you'll have leftovers to take home - we did ! The strolling accordion player didn't really play anything - he just walked around talking.

    "text": "An interesting style restaurant for special occasions.  Environment: Just as the name suggests, the restaurant itself is a hole in the wall. Right off the strip near the LINQ, the restaurant could be easy to miss from the outside. The interior, however is fashioned to have several different sections of the restaurants, with the tables and booths being sectioned off into little nooks of the restaurant. Additionally, the designing of the restaurant is nice. There are plenty of wall decorations as well as mirrors, painting, figurines, etc. to give the restaurant a more casual, homey feel.  Food: The style of ordering is a little peculiar in that it is a cross between traditional ordering and buffet style. Complimentary bread, soup, salad, and wine is given with any one entree ordered, for one person, and for each other person, they either must also order an entree or pay a flat price of $13. Between four of us we were not sure which would be a better deal, order 4 entrees (which seemed like a little much) or just pay the $13. In the end, we just decided since we are already paying we might as well get another entree even if it means potentially just boxing it up and taking it home. Our speculations were correct and by the end of the meal we had plenty of leftovers. We tried the linguini and clams, the lasagna, the chicken parmigiana, and the spaghetti and meatballs. Everything was tasty although I would not say any one thing particularly stood out to me. The garlic bread was very good though.  Service: Our server was very accommodating in walking us through the process of ordering and suggesting courses of action for us to take since all of us had never been here before. Additionally, he was very good about refilling our water and especially with making sure that our carafes of wine were always full.  Overall, this is the type of restraint I could only see myself going for certain occasions, however it was a fun experience and I can see why this is a classic place to go on the Las Vegas Strip.",

    "text": "Battistas was a lot log fun! All you can drink wine comes with every entree. Must I say more?   I went there with a large group of friends, however the staff were very attentive and got our food out to is quickly. This is a very interesting restaurant. The menu is on the wall and you get to select the entree you would like. Your entree will come with wine, salad and the entree you've chosen. I decided to go with the eggplant Parmesan.  I hate to say it was just okay, but it was. I was starving so I literally slammed it down. It was just sort of soggy unfortunately. It really wasn't anything special.   Everyone else seemed to really like their food though. I also think that the ambience and the fact that Battistas is off the strip is for sure a draw. It is also affordable and a nice change of pace of you are visiting the LV strip!",

    "text": "Contrary to popular belief, there are actually 8 deadly sins.  What is the 8th deadly sin, you may ask?  Coming to Vegas without popping into Hole in the Wall.  You go to Vegas without coming here and it might as well be a wash.  I don't care how much money you won or what show you went to.  You have to come here for dinner.  Hole in the Wall is a Vegas staple.  Been here for years.  How many?  Not sure, look it up.  Comfy intimate Italian restaurant close to everything, serving up pasta and meat classics.  The menu is on the wall, and there is nothing I could not recommend.  Anything will fill your belly up with love and comfort.  Although, the veal is phenomenal.  Poor little baby cow is a tasty little bugger.  All meals come with the famous unlimited white and red wine, bread, and soup or salad.  I switch it up between soup and salad.  I'm a gambler.  And when you are done gorging on your Italian feast, complimentary cappuccino.  SUPER sweet, piled high with fresh whipped cream to wash away the red sauce and pasta and cheese (so much cheese), and whatever else you may have stuffed in your  mouth.  And the cherry on top? GORDY the accordion player.  Sweet man who comes around to each table, asks you where you're from, and then plays a song for you while waiting for his tip.  He is adorable.  i want to put him in my pocket.  Remember: 8 deadly sins.  You gotta come here.",

    "text": "Gotta admit, my expectations for the food were really low walking in as a lot of reviews praised this place more for the experience/atmosphere and nostalgia rather than the food.  We were happy that we experienced the best of both tonight. My husband and I are both chefs in Vegas, not judgy up tight chefs, we're pretty easy to please. We got:   All you can drink red wine: 3/5  I'm pregnant so I didn't indulge in this part of the meal. I had a couple sips and it was pretty watered down like a boxed wine. But don't get me wrong. If there wasn't a baby in my belly I would have slammed it down. Why not   House salad- 4/5 I was expecting a run of the mill iceberg salad but was surprised when it came with a sexy mix of lettuces. Dressing is prefect, salad was crunchy and satisfying.   Garlic bread- 3.5/5 kind of tasted like processed garlic bread. It tastes like they took the garlic and herb seasoning packet you get in Pasta Roni and baked it on the bread with butter. The old college kid in me loves some Pasta Roni so I dug it. Was good to mop up extra dressing from my salad and sauce from my entree.   Chicken Parmesan- 4/5  10 oz breaded chicken breast topped w/ melted mozzarella, marinara (I think the marinara might just come from a can, but it was decent) and creamed spinach. They typically serve it with a side of penne marinara but I asked for fettuccine Alfredo ($2.50 up charge)  instead as I knew there would be plenty of marinara already on my plate. Here's a great tip, mix your creamed spinach in with the fettuccine Alfredo, sooooo good! The plate was solid, simple and to the point. Nothing out of the ordinary but it was satisfying for sure. Enough for two people.   Shrimp scampi- 4/5  Generous portion of shrimp and pasta, comes with mushrooms and lots of garlic, butter and fresh lemon which gave it a nice zip. I was surprised at how well seasoned and flavorful it was since other reviews  said it was bland. Would definitely order again.   After dinner \"cappuccino\"- 4/5 I'm pretty sure there's no coffee in here, but it was damn good! Tasted like Mexican hot chocolate w/ cinnamon. I love the old school mugs they serve it in too.   I'm so mad at myself that after living in Vegas for 12 years, this is the first time I've been to Battistas. Will definitely be back.",

Unfortunately we couldn't take our leftovers with us due to the lack or a fridge or microwave in our hotel but if we could have we would have.

We sat in a back room next to another large group, but it wasn't cramped.  The menu and ordering system is a little confusing. Supposedly it's family style, with large plates, but then we were told the plates would really only feed about 2 people so we should order one thing for every two people in the group. But there was something about a minimum order charge or split plate charge -- I can't remember but it wasn't explained to us very well.  Either way, the salads and soups were good (each person gets their choice of one or the other), and the food was good too. Nothing spectacular and nothing stood out enough for me to remember specifically, but it was good enough to please a crowd. Probably the best part was the \"Cappucino,\" which was really more like a hot chocolate than anything else. If you're looking for a unique experience, this is a good, \"different\" place to go that's not typical Vegas.",

    "text": "I would consider this place a classic Vegas must-do. It can get pretty crowded, so reservations are a good idea. The ambiance and decor are just totally awesome. The walls are packed with all kinds of pictures and autographs and other things to look at. It's got exactly the kind of character that I love. There's even an elderly man with a accordion thing that walks around and serenades the tables. (Tips are encouraged.) I just absolutely loved it.  The menu is posted up on the wall and is pretty straightforward. You get unlimited red or white wine. You get a house salad or minestrone soup. You get garlic bread. You choose your entree (there are about 5 different price levels ranging from $22 to $40), everything from spaghetti and meatballs to ribeye. If your entree doesn't already involve pasta, you get a side of penne with marinara sauce. You get a cappuccino. For the amount of food and drink involved and the quality, it's a pretty good deal for your money.  The wine was pretty good for being house wine. (We went with the red.) The salad was tasty - I liked the dressing. The minestrone soup was some of the best we've had. Our entrees were large and filling and yum. I opted for the steak caruso. It was a perfectly cooked steak on top of pasta with mushrooms and other veggies and just a little bit of a kick. The cappuccino was good. And we even got a free dessert, complete with a candle, since we mentioned it was our anniversary when we made our reservation. And that was tasty too. It wasn't the best pasta ever or anything, but it was good. And the ambiance made it awesome.  The service was great. Friendly and attentive. Never rushed. Checked on just the right amount. Good pace to all the food. All in all, we had a wonderful meal and experience here. I look forward to coming back.",

Upon entering Battista's, you'll be greeted with nearly no light. Which I discovered later was probably to make it harder to tell what exactly you're putting in your mouth. If you live for bad wine, you're in luck! With every entree, you get bottomless carafes of what I can only describe as, warm Kool-Aid made with vinegar instead of sugar, and it's served in tiny juice glasses! Yum!   The salad was pretty tasty, or maybe just seemed that way in comparison to the rest of the meal. Do you enjoy bread that's sat out on the counter for two weeks and then slathered with margarine and garlic powder? Hooray! Battista's has it!   For my main course, I had lasagna. Imagine tossing two cans of Beef-a-Roni into a dish, but instead of beef, it's mule, and melting some government cheese on it. If that's your taste, this is the meal for you!   After you've washed down your dog pound puppy chow with several cups of toilet wine, it's time for a refreshing cup of - what Battista's calls - cappuccino. Don't worry if you're Mormon, there is no caffeine in this, because it's dollar store hot chocolate!   During our dining experience, my friend excused herself twice to throw up.  When I got home, I also threw up, as did a third diner who was with us.   On a scale of 5, I give the food a 2 going down, and a 3 coming back up because it definitely tasted better on its way back out!   Barf Appetit!",

The sauce I couldn't really taste because of my taste buds being absent but it was amazing! I would recommend that to any!

Just a short walk away from the giant ferris wheel behind the Linq.  (Uber cannot pickup here, just a precaution).  Atmosphere is quirky/funky/fun. Great display of memorabilia, photos, bottles and barrels.  Now the food... Soup or salad, both great choices, neither disappoint.  Red and white wine served with meal, along with generous portions of delicious garlic bread.  Menu has great choices for all foodies, including seafood, steak and pasta.  You can really tasted the homemade care put into the meals.  We samples many plates between eight dishes, all were good. Lasagna is very rich, easily shareable. As most other dishes are plentiful enough to share (although there is a minimum charge for sharing).  Cappuccino/espresso drink after dinner was delicious as well. Rich and creamy, hint of cinnamon.  Last, the service. Very attentive, friendly and courteous staff. From the wait staff to the servers, all great.  Bottom line, give it a try, but don't expect to compare to the 'major chains' that are popular. You wont be disappointed.",

    "text": "We came here after I got a craving for some Italian food on the strip. After none of the other restaurants around sounded like the right fit, we decided to check out this little place a shirt walk off the strip. We are so glad we did.  Service here was great (had Frank as our waiter as well as Brandon), super friendly. Food wasn't the fastest to come out, but that's not surprising at a good Italian restaurant where you tend to linger over courses.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana with the fettuccine Alfredo on the side. So much food, and the alfredo sauce was the best I've had in a LONG time. Buttery and creamy, amazing flavor without being overly heavy.  And, almost most importantly, UNLIMITED WINE. You get a liter carafe at your table, either burgundy or Chablis. The burgundy was surprisingly buttery and smooth for a complimentary wine, and we made our way through two.  Needless to say, next time we're in Vegas we are coming back at LEAST once. If you're in the area and in the mood for some fantastic Italian food, this is the place to go!",

Especially when you're entertaining friends in town on the strip. It's got that old school Vegas vibe, without the new school Vegas prices. Pretty solid food, lots of choices with your entree, and wine too?! Plus, service is quick. Actually had our wedding rehearsal dinner here back in 2013. They accommodated 40 of us effortlessly. Love this place! I recommend the chicken parmigiana. The creamed spinach that comes with it is my favorite part!",

Great portions on the food, and of course, free wine, but the gravy was more brown than red, and not very flavorful. Lovely cup of cappucino to finish off the meal.",

Prices are good for what you get so a thumbs up for value and the free wine is a win and nice bonus.  Kids options are good here and I was a fan of their main dishes, ordered spaghetti with Cacciatore sauce (a little spicy), wife got the pomodoro, kid got the spaghetti with meatballs. The add ons were wonderful. The garlic bread was great, the minestrone was solid, and salad was fantastic as well. Their salad dressing is tasty and we'll balanced.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The cappuccino was a nice touch and ending to a very delicious and wonderful experience overall.  Parking was easy enough, and their staff was great and kind. Right next to The High Roller which is also a highly recommended attraction in Vegas.  4.777 stars rounded down which can easily become a solid 5 with another visit.  Thanks guys!",

Lots of dated pics on the walls with the owner and celebrities like Wayne Newton, Michael Landon, etc. This isn't BAD but definitely different than standard Strip restaurants. Service was friendly. That was a plus. The food though...not the greatest. Decent but nothing worth writing home about. The wine included with your meal is not worth it. There was a burgundy and a Chablis option. I am not a wine snob but could not drink them. The 'free cappuccino' was not cappuccino at all - it was hot chocolate.",

It seems like the type of place you get dragged to on your family reunion. A place your Great Aunt Sally from the middle of nowhere Wisconsin heard about from her hairdresser 7 years ago. Cool atmosphere, cool location, awful food.  On a Friday night the restaurant was booked. Make a reservation! As soon as you sit, they'll bring out the unlimited wine and garlic bread. The menu is on the wall, divided up by prices. Meat dishes come with a side of pasta. Everyone gets wine, everyone gets garlic bread, everyone gets a cappuccino with whipped cream.  We had a party of 8 and ordered different things. Sadly, there was not a single dish I would recommend. It was so bad, none of us took back our leftovers. (Portion sizes really weren't that big)  Sure you get unlimited wine, but the price was not worth it. For what you pay, you can get a much better meal elsewhere on the strip.  Parking is easy, you can park right outside the restaurant. T",

Found this gem in an very unassuming parking lot!! ( right by The Linq) Entered into a very dark and lively foyer! Little mini bottles of liquor behind glass. All kinds of things hanging from the ceiling. Seated in a wonderful booth. Quickly our server Giorgio arrived with 2 carafes of  wine. ( one white one red) Red Please.  Our choice of salad or soup. We chose salads. Fresh greens and tomato onion salami cheese with oil/vinegar.  Husband ordered Cannelloni with a side of sausage. I ordered Cheese ravioli with side of meatballs. Everything delightful!!  We did a good job on both!  Able to relax a bit and finish our carafe of wine.  Out came out cappuccinos with whipped cream!  No way we could have ever done dessert.  Not sure if they have any!  The little man was playing the accordion but he never made it to our room.  Can't wait to return!!",

Inedible.  2nd meal- spaghetti with meat sauce. Should have just had a lean cuisine in the hotel room. There was no sauce... it was spaghetti topped with dry ground beef.  3rd meal- chicken parm. Looked like slop and tasted like it too. Ick 4th meal- lasagna. Only edible meal at the table. And it wasn't even good. Just edible.  The only good thing they had was the garlic bread and it tasted like the stuff you put in the oven at home.   Even their water tasted grimey.   Do yourself a favor and skip this.

Although they may refer to it as a \"hole in the wall\" it is THE hole of Las Vegas. Papa took great care of us and shared a bit of history. I had the fettuccini mussels, my husband had lasagna, my 87yr old grandmother enjoyed the spaghetti and meat sauce and our uncle had the chicken parmigiana! Everyone loved their food! And of course... garlic toast, Italian salads and classic minestrone soup.  My mussels were impressively delicious. Large and meaty with the perfect tenderness. The sauce was fresh and PERFECT with a tiny kick of spice! This will be the spot we continue to come back to as a tradition! Also... you get a carafe of both a red and white wine. I would guess the white to be similar to a Pinot Grigio/Chardonnay blend and the red is similar to a merlot'ish blend. They are table wine yes and not a high class bottle as they are unlimited and included in your meal so don't complain just drink! (There is a full bar if you want something more your taste)  This place is a MUST. Truly a Las Vegas stamp!",

The meals include soup or salad, entree, garlic bread, and cappuccino.  Entrees range $23-35. They start you with a soup or salad. The salad is made with romaine and fresh ingredients. They serve it with a creamy Italian dressing. The soup is pasta fagoili and is fresh.  They bring you warm toasted Italian bread with garlic butter on it.   I had the lasagna. It is a large portion. It did not taste fresh. I did not like the sauce flavor. The mozzarella cheese on top looked like melted plastic.   Other people at the table ordered chicken Parmesan and were not impressed by it.   The cappuccino tasted more like hot chocolate with cinnamon. It was topped with whipped cream. I liked it.   Each table has privacy. Overall, it is a fun ambiance but not the highest quality food. It's a good place to try at least once. It is next to Bally's and by the high roller ferris wheel.",

Meals come with soup or salad, garlic bread, and cappuccino at the end. \"Unlimited house wine\" has a very low alcohol content which may or may not be a good thing. The good news: no hangover.  Remarkably easy to find and a leisurely five-minute walk from the Strip, adjacent to Bally's side door and right behind the Cromwell.",

Our server was wonderful and the food was fantastic so I waited a whole year to come back here for my birthday again and this time, the food was still fantastic but our server ruined the whole experience. I don't know her name but she was probably 70 years old, super tall, skinny hair I think like brown and gray with a little pigtail in the back/ we came at 9 o'clock in the 14th and I think it must've been past her bedtime she would barely listen to our orders and then run away / when asked how a dish tasted her reply was - it's great / deadpan didn't every look at us when speaking - she didn't give a crap what we ordered - I think she was annoyed because we had a Groupon or something who knows she was a aloof, short and rude to us in general didn't give us any options brought us my birthday dessert didnt ask us if we wanted anything else and that she never asked us if everything was OK or you wanted anything else - she seemed angry to be there and treated us like cattle she needs to be at a fast food place cooking burgers in the back without any human interaction she never cracked a smile zero welcoming qualities / IF I ever go here again I will make sure I ask for anyone but her - otherwise the food was great but the service stunk",

Our server arrived quickly and took our food order. No one asked is about drink. I'm guessing it's because the house red and white wine is complementary.  The food came out quickly and it was good!

Did I mention the FREE Red and White Wine? Lol. Everything on the menu is delicious. I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the area.",

Tried to get the waitress's attention multiple times but I forgot I wore my invisibility cloak apparently because she didn't even look my way. We sat in our booth for another 20 minutes without a waiter even coming by. Then, as a favor to us, another waiter decides to come by and hand us salads (that we didn't order) to tide us over. It was fairly obvious that the salads were made quite a long time ago.  Fast-forward to ordering our dinners (no, really, because we sat there for another 15 minutes after our salad bowls were cleared), I ordered the cheese ravioli. Surprise, surprise, waited again for the most mediocre cheese ravioli and flavorless marinara sauce I've ever had. No one in my 5 person group bothered to finish their meal because it just wasn't worth it.  They don't do split checks, so be warned. But the free house wine was delicious, so there's that.",

It was really a fun experience with the ambiance and the food.    We had 5 woman and couldn't decide how to order.  The bus boy who helped us seemed confused that we were asking.  Maybe people could figure it out, ha ha, but we couldn't.  In the end we ordered 2 chicken Parmesan's and 2 side order of meatballs.  We all got the salad, bread, wine, and the cappuccino at the end.  Plus the chicken parm came with a huge bowl of pasta.  It was a lot of food and perfect for us.  The chicken parm came with a side of creamed spinach as well.  We had a little left over, but not much.  The garlic bread was to die for!  And the antipasta salad in the beginning was great.  We did not try any desserts.  Being a foodie, of sorts, I wasn't sure what to expect but it was a fabulous restaurant.  The wine on the table was a nice touch.  We could just fill up our glasses when we wanted to.  I would certainly go back here again.  Also, mad props to the strolling entertainment.  That little man is amazing!!",

    "text": "Just got back from a blast at the Hole in the Wall! Came here on a recommendation from a friend of a friend. Had reservations for 4, arrived early and sat immediately. I wish I had time to actually look around. Decor is like Buca di Beppo on steroids! But also, authentic! Service, as has previously been reported accurately, was robotic, but friendly. As a group of 4, we took the \"all you can drink\" part seriously, but only managed two large carafes.  When they hand you a thimble for a glass, you get amped...but the reality is, we likely shared 3L among the 4 of us in less than an hour. Regardless, most of what others say is accurate.  Except my salad was amazing, with lettuce, tomatoes, ham (antipasti) and olives with a house dressing. Full disclosure, it was as big as I usually make for a lunch at home! Bread, check!! Omg.  I mentioned when I ordered my meatballs that I didn't really want pasta so they doubled the meatballs, which was great until I realized I couldn't eat that much! What a waste.  I did not care for the cappuccino at the end of the meal. While heavily whipped creamed, I am a black coffee drinker and this smacked of sugar. So bad. I couldn't stomach it. So, the food here was great, the service decent, but what really ,made it for us was the couple who was sat next to us and allowed us to be our rowdy, 2-carafe authentic selves. This couple from Mississsippi had just the right amount of \"bless your heart\" to keep us laughing and fully reveling in the family atmosphere. That's the luck of the draw, so get a reservation and hope you get a great table mate!",

Let's begin with the good stuff. Wine, wine & even more wine! This is how the conversation goes with the waiter ~  Waiter: White or red? Me: Both please Waiter: (laughs) So you've been here before...  You get wine with your meal & I'm happy to say that I've never once left here not tipsy :)   Does the food taste better when you're tipsy? Sure it does...  We always order the same two meals; cheese ravioli with a marinara sauce and Chicken Rio (chicken breast smothered in a creamy white sauce over noodles and veggies on the side). Both are usually good but on this last trip both were barely warm and our chicken dish had hardly any sauce on it. Each meal comes with a soup or salad and we get one of each. My man gets the minestrone which was sent back this time because it was lukewarm & poorly seasoned and I get the salad which is really consistently great. This time I noticed they added croutons which is unnecessary and they were so hard that one of them left a little cut in my mouth :(  Please get rid of these hard croutons....  The garlic bread is fantastic here and always comes out straight out of the oven and you also get sweet cappuccinos with whipped cream for dessert. I love the sweet ending! Let me also mention the old school ambiance that looks like a hoarders dream. I dig it and it's fun and on the dark side which is always extra romantic.   Service has always been great and not sure what's going on in the kitchen but we hope they get it together. We might give it another chance but no more after the next try if things don't improve.",

    "text": "3 stars for the food, rounded up to 4 stars for great service!   First of all, the concept of this old school Italian restaurant is different. There is a minimum $13 fee per person, but each entree is around $23-$41. This means that you can either choose to have a ton of food, or to pay the $13 fee which includes salad or soup, wine, garlic bread, and a cappuccino.   For the 4 of us, we decided to just get 4 entrees so that we had extra to bring home. If you are just visiting and don't want leftovers, then I'd suggest just paying the $13 per person. I'd say that 3 entrees for 4 people would've been a good amount to order for us, since the soup/salad and garlic bread were pretty good and filling.  We really enjoyed the chicken parmesan and the lasagna. The spaghetti and 2 meatballs was pretty standard. We also got the linguini with chopped clams in white sauce and it was not very good.  I'd definitely come back for the ambiance, unlimited carafes of wine, garlic bread, and to try other pasta dishes. The service was great and they were very attentive in refilling our wine and bread. I was sad that the accordion player didn't come to our table, but maybe next time!",

    "text": "Service and the atmosphere are great but the food lid a little sub-par.  There is a roaming accordion player that is adorable and charming. The menu has a wide variety. My husband I chose classics: manicotti and cheese ravioli- $25.95 each. They tasted frozen and processed- not authentic.   Each meal comes with a house salad, red and/or white House wine, garlic bread and a cappuccino.  The salad was so-so. It has a slice (like you would get at the deli counter) of salami in it with a hunk of processed mozzarella cheese and is slightly overdressed.   The wine was for sure cheap, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy considering it was included. The meal, depending on what you picked, doesn't take too long to get there but again, isn't anything to write home about.  It seemed like previously frozen, processed pasta- not homemade- with processed cheeses and canned sauce. I've had better at chains. The garlic bread wasn't fresh- seemed like it had been sitting a while and was hard. I tasted the cappuccino and it was ok but had a strong nutty flavor, almost like pecan.   Again, the 2 stars are for the ambiance and the accordion player than came by our table to entertain.   It's Vegas- there are so many places with much better food for the same price.",

The garlic bread was soaked in garlic-absolutely amaZing! We heard about this place from a local and thankful we did! Soup,salad,  BOTTLE of wine, garlic bread, two entrees and two cappuccinos... $66..nothing better than that.. we are stuffed and have a whole meal basically to take back with us!!  P.s.

Good:  - the garlic bread - the waiter (Doug) was polite and nice  - unlimited red and white wine   Bad: - the salad was terrible, way too much lime juice was added to it. It was inedible.  - the vegetable minestrone soup is made from beef broth. The server didn't mention it until we specifically asked. Why call it vegetable soup if it isn't vegetarian??  - the capacino served at the end is diabetic inducing. It has way too much sugar. How about not adding sugar and giving it on the side?  Ugly: - the clam pasta had 5 clams each the size of a dime. The pasta sauce (olive oil and garlic) had very little flavour and taste.  - the vegetarian Pasta (Tomato based sauce) was bland and flavorless. I've had store bought pasta sauce that tasted better.  -the lighting in the restaurant is horrid. It's a mix of dark yellow and orange. At first we didn't mind it, but as we spent more time in the restaurant, we started getting headaches. And we couldn't enjoy whatever little taste the food had.  - With all the problems above, the food is very expensive and you are left with a big hole in your wallet.   My experience at this restaurant has been a life changing one. I have decided that hence forth I shall never ever set foot inside a restaurant that has rating of less than 4 stars.   Tl;dr: stay away from this place!",

    "text": "Everyone seems to love Batista's, and there must be a reason. But I sure didn't see many reasons to like it last night. It was my first visit---I went with out-of-town relatives who absolutely love the place.   The pluses first: The atmosphere is great, it's vintage Vegas and there are photos galore of everyone who is or was anyone. I love the carafes of house red and white wine they give you, and constantly refill. It's house wine, yes, but I really liked the white chablis. They also give you big baskets of garlic bread, and the Italian salad was quite good.  Now the minuses: My biggest problem with Batista's last night was the wait staff's attitude and the feeling I got of being rushed. Everything they did and said---and how they said it---screamed \"We want to move you out of here as fast as we can.\" No smiles from the waiters, nothing friendly about them, just all business get-you-out-of-here attitudes. Our waiter brought an armload of salads to the table (yes, stacked on his arm), and said \"Anyone here who doesn't want a salad?\" We all did, and he dealt them out around the table, just like a 21 dealer. He took our orders and soon our food arrived.  I had steak pizzaiola. My plate was 3/4 steak covered in sauce, and 1/4 creamed spinach. It was mass of liquid. Frankly, it looked unappetizing, but the steak was very good. I didn't eat the spinach, though, I couldn't get past how it looked. They never brought my side order of pasta (the menu says you get soup or salad, garlic bread, a side of pasta, and cappuccino). I didn't realize they'd forgotten it until I was done eating because I felt so rushed. They dropped capuccinos on the table and the rush feeling really started. That's when I realized there's no dessert menu! I guess they don't want guests lingering over dessert. Since the family in our group hadn't seen each other in a couple of years, we were all talking over our coffee, but they kept trying to get us out of there! So we finally obliged them.  My dinner was $29.95, and I've certainly had far better for that price or less. Although the food was good, the presentation (at least of my dish) was just awful, and forgetting the pasta side just shouldn't have happened. And the truth is they weren't really all that busy. There was no line out the door, and I'm not sure anyone had to wait for a table if they didn't have a reservation. Normally I would have had a better steak, like a ribeye or a NY strip, but those were $39.95 on their menu, and I don't pay that much for a steak that's just a steak (it's not like the menu said it's kobe or even angus). I can't speak at all for the past dishes since I didn't have any, but those who had pasta in my party liked it.   Overall, I was pretty disappointed. To me, it seems like so many people come to Batista's (perhaps just so they can say they've been there) that Batista's no longer cares about the customer as much as they used to. Or, for all I've written, it might have just been a bad night. Whatever the case, it was a disappointing enough experience that I won't be going back, and I won't be taking guests there. Hope you all have better luck than I did.",

You only got one choice of soup which came to me luke warm. Then the main course steak pasta meal was very bland. Steak wasn't seasoned and the meal itself tasted like nothing. Then they give you a cappochino that has no espresso or coffee content.  To rub it in my face in the end it came to over $70. Olive garden isn't authentic Italian but if you want better quality food I suggest going there or any other Italian place. I wasn't the only one that complained that night. A couple across from us asked to speak to the chef about the food. Don't understand how they lasted for so long but they have definitely lost there way since it first opened.

The menu is posted on the wall and all meals include wine (your choice of red or white), salad and their amazing garlic bread. I recommend the egglpant parm which is baked with the right amounts of sauce and cheese. While the wine is nothing to write home about, its good enough and goes well with anything on the menu. If you're heading out for a night of drinking on the strip, Battista's is a good first stop for a hearty meal.",

The red sauce they use on everything is uninspired, the pasta is cold by the time it gets to you, and the quality of meats is low. I am not a wine snob, but it is not even at 3 Buck Chuck level. I don't see myself returning again.",

Everything from the Over sized (bullet proof?) door, to the personally signed photo of Elvis Presley (The King) and all other photos, this place overwhelmingly reminded me of an Italian restaurant out of the movie CASINO.  (WITH ALL DUE RESPECT  :)   ) I think this place is where Bucca di Beppo got its inspiration with with real food that doesn't come from a bag...  THE BREAD: FUGHETABBOUT IT.....  Just remember, ask for the oil & vinegar. Delish!  THE WINE: ALL YOU CAN DRINK HOUSE WINE. Enough said.  THE FOOD: I had the spaghetti w/ Sausage Cacciatore.  Really, really good!  THE SERVICE: Our waiter patiently explained all the ins and outs of each dish giving a well scripted definition of the dish which set the expectation of the guest.   CONS: Be prepared to pay around $30 per person, but hell it's Vegas and every trip should have at least one solid meal.  OVERALL:  Great conversation, Great food, Great environment.  And as always friends and neighbors, when it comes to Food, Drink or Overall Value........Always trust a FAT MAN! :).  Pat Walters Anaheim, CA",

There was a huge line and after speaking with the hostess she made us a reservation an hour and a half away.  We were lucky enough that our hotel was right by the restaurant.  Sure, as the reviews say the entree prices may seem high but when you think you don't need to order anything else I found it was cheaper than going to other restaurants.  I ordered the Chicken Marsala, my husband the Veal Marsala.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I thought the pasta that came with it did no wonders for it but after the garlic bread, soup and wine who could eat all that anyway?   I would go again if I ever visit Vegas again.  The waitress was friendly, the feel of the restaurant was good and we had a good time.",

    "text": "1. Overall, a mediocre mix of food and generic experience. It is truly, by all definitions - a tourist trap. One sign of this is that it is only open after 5 pm daily. Literally, a bus or two will come through every evening as far as I can tell. (I am a 36 year resident of Las Vegas.)  2. First, the food. Olive Garden is at least two levels better in quality. My wife and I believe the sauce is simply canned, nothing more or less. The lasagna, again, normal. Any degree of spice or uniquity is simply altogether missing. Strangely enough, the garlic bread was good and so was the expresso - small victories for a higher, mid-level priced dinner.  3. I think the 'never-ending' free wine basically makes many customers happy in lieu of good food. It's normal.  4. The wait was was long - 30 minutes, because of the tour bus. The bar drink we had while waiting was experience.  5. With all due respect, the accordion player with the disability, was playing off of peoples emotions. He would play a few seconds literally, say the same thing to most of the tables in the room - most of it was geared towards how beautiful the female was, everyone would give him money,and then 30 minutes later, the same routine, and same peddling for money. It's not right. We felt pressured to do as the other tables did and give him a few bucks each time.  6. Of all the Italian places to eat in Las Vegas, I would never suggest this place to eat. Fast-food or sit-down are all superior to this.   7. As I read in another review, it is True that the decor is somewhat interesting with vintage Las Vegas pictures. But does this overcome the shortcomings? No. I am torn between 1 and 2 stars.",

The gimmick of \"free\" (poor tasting) wine is not worth it. No one, especially tourists, should ever eat here. I had the chicken parm, which was a large, flavorless chunk of chicken. Their sauce is the blandest red sauce ever. It came with some kind of revolting spinach goo.  The salad is served in plastic bowls. The garlic bread has some kind of grainy butter paste spread on it. Every dinner is served with plastic covers on scary metal hospital carts. The after dinner cappuccino tasted like burnt caramel.  After they had taken our plates, we asked for more wine and were told the \"free\" wine only comes with dinner, so don't make that mistake. Better yet, DO NOT EAT HERE EVER.",

Eat 'til you explode and drink yourself stupid on house wine...the Strip and all the tourists cramming it up get way more entertaining that way.  The decorations are kitschy, but that's part of the charm.  The tables are a little crammed together in some areas; this is more a homey, friendly atmosphere than a quiet, romantic restaurant.  Be sure to keep a few small bills handy to tip Gordy, the restaurant's accordionist.  He's an absolute trip.  Reservations are definitely recommended if your party is larger than two people and/or you don't like to wait over an hour for a table.",

Way too much cheese. It's very difficult to mess up pasta I would imagine but this place accomplished it. All of us who went threw up. My friend took two bites of her meal and threw up. I threw up as soon as I got home, either from the nasty food or the bad wine. Hard to tell. My other friend who came with us also threw up as soon as we got home. The good or decent reviews are very confusing since this is definitely the worst Italian food I've ever had, and I'm not picky. Also the portion sizes aren't that big for most meals but the food was so bad it did not matter. The only thing they didn't screw up was the salad, and I have to give them credit there because I think salad is easier to screw up than pasta. Also being drunk off the wine didn't make the nasty food taste any better, which is saying something since McDonald's is delicious when you're drunk. The service was excellent though, but also because there was barely anyone in there on a Friday evening.. if you decide to go, good luck!",

The portions are huge and yummy.   My lasagna was so cheesy it was like queso fundino with sauce.   My wife's cannelloni was a bucket of fresh ricotta wrapped in a pasta blanket.   My sister's sausage (wasn't that a CBS show?) was yum.   We ate for a long time and it looked like we never started.   Make sure your room has a fridge.   And we ended up with uneaten garlic bread.   Who doesn't finish off a basket of garlic bread?   I mean, besides the Lost Boys.   Oh, and personally I'm glad the endless wine isn't super awesome wine.  I don't like wine, but this stuff was slightly watery and slightly flat  so I was able to throw it down.  Hey, here comes Gordy, the accordion player!   He's like a mariachi band only it's one guy, I understand the words,  and I don't shrink in my seat when he comes by.   Keep a fiver in your pocket to give him -  the guy will need a second hip soon.  The service is great, too.  I didn't like much my minestrone soup.   It had, like, every vegetable in it.   I could point out so many it was like a Richard Scarry book.   So I asked if I could get the salad (mmm with a slice of salami) instead.   \"No problem!\"    Can we get more garlic bread?   \"Sure, please make room for a shoebox size basket of garlic bread\".   Hey, since this wine is endless, can I leave my car here?   \"Please do.  Would you like us to fill it with garlic bread?\"  Oooh, and that hot chocolatey cappuccino at the end w/ whipped cream! Nothing's better on a stomach full of 2 pounds of cheese  and a gallon of wine than some hot liquid chocolate coffee. Keep your leftovers so you have something to eat while you're in the bathroom :)",

As a fan of Italian food and wine, I wanted to see if it was any good here. I went with a group of 6 or so on a Friday night and there was a wait of 45 minutes. Once seated, we were offered house white and red wine. Average wine of course, nothing special. Since it was busy, it took a while for our food to come out but we didn't mind as we had wine to preoccupy us.  The ambiance is warm and cozy, the place pretty dimly lit (view pictures to see).  I got the lasagna and it wasn't anything to rave about. I didn't finish it nor take the leftovers home. The free wine is great, but the food is important too. I would most likely check out other Italian restaurants before returning here.",

The meals for a party of 5 came with soup, salad and unlimited white and red wine. I am NOT a wine drinker, did not know this upon ordering. The meal was just ok. The soup was a minestrone and the salad had salami in it..was real good. The main meal, spaghetti was Nothing spectacular. Rather pricey. Paid for wine.(see photos)",

Each meal includes wine, garlic bread, salad, the entree, a side of pasta and a cappuccino. So it's a full-service joint.  The servers are usually on the ball and the hosts handle reservations well. Their 90-year-old accordion player is a rare treat but sometimes he lingers too long for tips, which can confuse first-time diners who don't know they're supposed to fund him.  Most importantly, you'll never go home hungry. Opt for this place over the usual chains and you'll be glad you did.",

Cons: Dimly lit (could use more light to read menus), cramped (can hear neighboring conversations - one step and you'd be at someone else's table), food so-so tho I did like the pasta side dish with sauce.   Felt like a tourist experience.   If not a wine drinker can sub soft drink or iced tea - lemonade not included.

We stayed at the Flamingo and we were able to walk to the restaurant. We made same day reservations and arrived a bit before our time. We were able to enjoy a drink in the bar area.  The restaurant is dark, decorated with old photos on the walls, the menus are posted on the walls. The restaurant is divided into rooms. We got a nice little cozy table in a corner. We were brought over water, the server asked what kind of wine we wanted, red or white, we went with both. After he took our order warm, delicious, garlic bread was brought to us. OMG I could have skipped dinner and just eaten the bread. YUM! Our meals came with a soup or salad and we both went with the house salad. It was very good.  I went with the chicken Alfredo and it was on point. My bf had a steak caruso dish and he was impressed with it. It had tender pieces of steak with sauteed veggies. We both enjoyed our meals and I can honestly say that it was the best meal I had in Vegas. At the end of our meal we got complimentary cappuccinos that were to die for. The cozy atmosphere, great home cooked pasta, great service, dining in an establishment that has been there for 40 yrs, I was in heaven.  We also got serenaded by a cute little old man playing the accordion.  I highly recommend you try this hole in the wall place while in Vegas, you will not be disappointed!",

We came for dinner last night around 7:00pm because who doesn't love Italian food right? It was very very busy though.   I ordered the lasagne which was just mediocre. Portion was huge I probably only ate a quarter of it. My hubby got chicken Alfredo which was DELICIOUS!!!!! Definitely recommend that. My mom got linguine with clams and garlic. And her husband got the NY steak. The noodles were okay but my mom really didn't enjoy the fact they didn't have any freshly grated Parmesan cheese or freshly grated cracked pepper. And the steak was supposed to be well done but came out medium and almost raw.  Also they never took our drink order I had to personally ask for iced tea and waters even though the table next to us was asked immediately after being seated what they want to drink.  Garlic bread is very good!!! My daughter ate about 7 pieces instead of touching any pasta. The salad had waaaay too much vinegar my tongue felt very tangy after each bite. The minestrone was great though!!!   For desserts we ordered a spumoni and tiramisu for the birthday boys! The spumoni was delicious. The tiramisu however, not so much. It was made with layered yellow cake instead of sponge fingers and I hated it!!!! Didn't taste anything at all like tiramisu and I know my tiramisu. Not even a strong coffee taste at all.  The one thing I did really enjoy was the bottomless white wine as well as the cappuccino that comes with dinner!!! The cappuccino was soooooo good I drank two. And probably 3 or 4 glasses of the white wine.",

And the unlimited house wine with the meal was of course the best bonus! Garlic bread was amazing as well. The only thing was that the salad was a bit sad looking. Mostly lettuce with a slice of salami in it. Still good though.  The decor was super cute too. Lots of nick knacks and things to look at. It gets busy here so come expecting to wait for a table.

As soon as we walked in the door it smelled amazing! The menu is reasonably sized. And every meal comes with bread sticks, salad or soup, all you can drink wine, and a cappuccino at the end! Talk about an amazing deal!!! The white wine was to die for, not cheap tasting and not overly sweet, it was just right! And our server jessica was perfect!

We quickly ordered and were given our delicious garlic bread and salads (can also get soup). The atmosphere was great but a little too dark making it hard to read the menu and really take in the surroundings. Our food came very quickly and wasn't bad. I expected the food to be a little more than it was but it was tasty. I would have to say that the best part of the meal was the homemade cappuccino you get at the end of the meal. If I could drink that daily I would! Heaven in a cup!",

To be very honest the food was just okay but definitely nothing exciting. It's the atmosphere that truly makes it. The sad part is that the original owner has retired and Its now owned by a large corporation.",

I came in around 8pm on Sunday and not was pretty busy,  not too crazy.  We waited about 5 minutes and then we were seated which was excellent.  The front host staff is great and welcoming.   The experience and service was fine my 3 stars are for the food. Bland with a capital B. And the table wine is terrible,  not even drinkable really.  I ordered the chicken parm and my husband ordered the chicken fettuccine the sauce om my children parm really didn't have any flavor... then they brought a side of noodles with the same sauce, I think i used a table spoon of salt before it tasted decent. It comes with garlic bread, Amazing.  And some bland soup.   My husband's fettuccine was watery and the chicken had this weird burnt taste. They have a coffee that comes out at the end which was good.  I probably will not be returning for a third time... unless someone else was paying and I could just eat garlic bread... not worth the $90 bucks I dropped.",

Wine (red or white) is AWFUL like horrible cheap in a box but worse stuff.  Still, due to someone daring someone else to drink we killed 2 carafes of white and 1/2 of red.  Blech....still tasted bad and it didn't get any better!  Ambiance was OK, not super 'old school Vegas' as others would recommend; however, the wait staff was pleasant and not in a hurry to shuffle us out the door at 10pm when they closed.  The first course included soup or salad, and we mostly got the salad - mixed greens from the bag at the grocery store, complete with bottled dressing and crappy bread.  Food included spag with meat sauce (extra sauce requested and it came on the side, a-plenty), Aurora sauce (not the best, not the worse), Filet of something that basically was Fajitas minus the Tortillas and the fish stew, which had two small halves of tough, chewy crab, shrimp that was equally unappetizing and overcooked, perhaps purchased in bulk at Sam's Club,    Seriously, the ONE saving grace was the cappuccino - homemade and amazingly wonderful - honestly, the best ever.  So, if you're looking to spend a few $$ for a great after dinner drink come here.  Otherwise, skip it.  Wish someone would have warned us more sternly!  I've attached pics so you can see the seriously average food.",

Their dinners come complete with warm, crusty Italian bread, soup or salad, ALL YOU CAN DRINK WINE and a cappuccino after your meal.  The prices range around $20 - $40 each depending on what you order but hey if you are out to celebrate it's on point.  We went on a Thursday night about 5pm, it was packed already.  It's close to the Strip so expect a little bit of a wait but they seated us faster than they estimated.  Go with the waiter's recommendation.  If you can't decide, ask his opinion for sure. He recommended the LASAGNA to us and oh my, thank you! It's the classic lasagna you imagine when you hear the word.   My sis got the CHICKEN PARM - it was good and came with a side of creamed spinach.  I was happier with my choice :)",

Will never come back. Had heard so much about this rest. we had to try it and see if we will bring out of town guests here, NOPE!

The food was pretty good - okay, the bread wasn't great and the included salad sits on a rolling cart until you order, but the pasta was decent.

Here's the thing, if this place was in a little town in the middle of nowhere, I'd say okay but it's just off the strip in Vegas. The culinary capital of the world people. There are at least 100 superb restaurants within a mile radius, so WHY would you ever go here??? lol but people do and my guess is, they're tourists and they don't know any better. I can pretty much guarantee if you are a local you would never ever choose to go here!  The place was packed! We had to wait over an hour, which didn't bother me because there was plenty of seating. The atmosphere is kinda cool but there are plenty of restaurants with that type of atmosphere/decor. The service was not very good. My friends raviolis came out ice cold. I had the chicken parmigiana, it was okay, kinda bland - nothing special. The \"free wine\" (I use the term free very loosely since I paid $28 for a piece of chicken - I'm sure the price of that nasty free wine was compensated for with the overpriced piece of chicken) was disgusting....the red smelled and tasted like red wine vinegar and the white wine was warm - yes white wine warm!? There was spinach that accompanied my chicken that as soon as I took a bite I wanted to spit out....but of course didn't. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I sat and tried to figure out this distinct (overwhelming) flavor in the spinach and when the server came over I asked her if anise was in the spinach. She looked at me in surprise and said you're the only person that has ever guessed what's in that. She said people either love it or they tell her to get it off their plate. I'm guessing the former group is a small group, so I'm wondering why they serve it? Oh gawd it was gross. Black licorice flavored mushy over cooked spinach.....not my idea of good food. Sorry but if you're planning on going, I'd say go across the street to McDonald's and save yourself some money......seriously!  BTW - there were a group of Italian speaking guys behind us that got their food as we were leaving......gawd I wish I could have seen their face when they bit into that \"Italian\" food!!",

I've had better Italian, but not by much...and the servings are large, especially for the price. Come here, get carbed up, get drunk on wine, and walk out with enough money to continue gambling.",

The Italian red sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle and the chicken parm was completely off what it should be. Save yourself the time and money try finding good Italian food elsewhere. I would give 0 stars if I could.",

    "text": "Went here decades ago and it was really good.  Went again last week and I wanted to cry.  The red marinara on the manicotti tasted like canned pizza sauce.  Really awful.  The wine wasn't very good but it was free table wine so I should shut the hell up about that, don't you think?  I was so disappointed.  I do have to admit the service was good. And thank God the after dinner cappuccino was as good as I'd remembered it being.  Guess I'll have to give it at least 2 stars because of the cappaccino.",

I drink cheaper wine sometimes, but this red wine was  absolutely aweful.  The food was very generic and nothing really worth noting. Bland.  Fairly priced, but I definitely won't be back.  Can't believe some people think this is actually good italian food.",

    "text": "We really enjoy this place. It is old school the food is heavy and comes out in large portions.the accordion player played all the Sinatra/Martin songs we could throw at him while we were waiting at the bar for our table. I enjoyed my veal parma very much. I am only giving 4 stars as yes like some other reviewers I agree the place does need a little overhaul. I would not change anything but I would clean up a bit perhaps dust repaint some parts but still keep all the history.",

    "text": "I love the concept of having the menu on the wall in several places to make it easy to see what you want and remember what you ordered. I also enjoyed the convenience of the \"pre-fixe\" menu, in that you get the wine, bread, soup/salad and entree included with every dinner. The only downfall to this is if you aren't hungry enough for all of the food that's coming your way. It would be nice to be able to order just an entree or soup/salad, but I the current system works as well.     The bread was AMAZING!!! The eggplant parm was AMAZING, even though it didn't have spaghetti included, but I wasn't hungry enough for that anyway.     Stay away from the white wine if you like things that taste good. It's all about that red wine. Unless, of course, the red wine carafe is empty, in which case drink up that free booze!    Overall, a great experience. Loved the accordion player. And cheap booze at the bar! $6 whiskey and coke!!!",

    "text": "This place is SURREAL.  I strongly recommend you visit it at least once just to experience it.  You'll feel like you're having dinner in the 1960s.  Surprisingly, it's my second dining experience in the last two months that involved time travel.  First, there was the world famous West Shore Diner . . . (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/west-shore-diner-lemoyne#hrid:DHBdTFfMrO-QCOqxjxFx1Q\">yelp.com/biz/west-shore-...</a>), and now - Battista's.  Holy flux capacitor, Batman!  We came here at 5:30 pm last Monday, because my friend had a coupon for a free dinner for two.  Didn't I tell you it helped to know the right people?  The restaurant brags about its \"hole in the wall\" appeal right in its name, although in reality it is much nicer than that.  This restaurant is located directly behind The Barbary Coast, or Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon as it's known today.  Battista's even has its own parking lot - enter on Audrey St off Flamingo Rd.  When you walk inside, you feel like an Applebee's opened a new location inside Abe Lincoln's Log Cabin.  There are so many tchotchkes on the walls, you don't know where to look first.  The gems of their trinket collection, in my humble opinion, were tiny liquor bottles neatly arranged inside a glass cage.  The \"Maximum occupancy: 8,000 people\" and \"Parking for Italians Only\" sign were nothing compared to the sign above the urinals in men's bathroom: \"Your future is in your hands.\"  We were seated at a large table with red vinyl chairs and a white tablecloth.  The waiter came by with the menus and waters, although the menu was posted on the wall.  It looks as though it hasn't changed since the 1960s anyway.  You can only get complete dinners here.  You pick your entree, and the rest is included.  The entrees range in price from $20.95 to $31.95, depending on what you choose.  Since our meal was free, I went with the more expensive option of veal parmigiana for $29.95.  You meal includes a salad or a cup of minestrone soup, garlic bread, a side of pasta, a post-meal cappuccino and unlimited house wine, red or white.  \"Hold on a second!  Did he say 'unlimited wine???'\"  He sure did.  I don't know anything about wine, but I'd venture a guess it's not the best wine you've ever tasted.  Still, you can't beat the price.  FREE is FREE.  The meal also includes a serenade by a 5' 3'' 75-year-old man with an old accordion.  The serenade is pretty much a must, since there's nothing you can tell him that would stop him from singing it.  Hey, he works for tips.  We weren't on a date, but he still said he had \"something special for the beautiful lady.\"  So, I was guilted into paying $2 for a so-horrible-that-it's-funny rendition of:  \"When you're smiling, when you're smiling, The whole world smiles with you; When you're laughing, when you're laughing, The sun comes shining through.\"  The food wasn't very good.  I'd say it's Olive Garden quality at Las Vegas prices.  My veal parmigiana was tasteless with loads of cheese on top.  The garlic bread had so much butter, I am surprised it didn't seep right through the basket.  The salad was pretty good, and the cappuccino was delicious.  I'd go there in a second for a free meal.  However, now that I've tried it, I wouldn't rush back.  You have to go at least once though.",
