    "text": "This is a reason for people to get on Yelp or else they would never find this hidden Henderson hole in the wall restaurant located near our auto body shop. Special thanks to my Yelpers for their great reviews on Penn's...even moreso for their recommendation on the CRISPY GARLIC CHICKEN and GREEN TEA BUNS (Not on the menu and I would appreciate you keeping it a secret as well ;)  Green Tea Buns...deep sigh. I never tried them but saw they were a popular Yelp item so I wanted to see for myself. I almost made the mistake of getting only 6, but quickly rectified my order to 12 when I imagined my voracious family gobbling them up like Pac Man pellets. I am so glad I did. As soon as I brought home the dozen of these cold little buns, popped them in the microwave under a damp paper towel for about 25 seconds (did 2 at a time), they were gone! These fluffy buns are so light and the green tea filling is so delicately sweet with a slight coconuty taste that melts in your mouth. I LOVE these and will be back for more.  The Crispy Garlic Chicken is perfect. Crunchy, deep fried battered white meat chicken with the best crust in a sticky, sweet, salty, tangy sauce that is perfectly balanced. This is another favorite that I will come back for.  Ambiance is nothing special but who cares...the food is great and service is friendly. But keep your hands off my buns!",

Patty told us about the terrific green tea buns and we will try them in the future.  We felt as if we were eating at a friend's house.  She brought us some delicious fresh mangos to finish our visit.  Absolutely five stars for food,  service and cleaniness.  We can't wait to meet Penn, who was in Thailand on vacation.",

Lunch specials are very reasonable and when they have the Green Tea buns in stock we'll eat two there and get four to go for later. Our friends do order different food so I'm sure the other food they offer is just as good but the wife and I default to yellow curry chicken. If mangos are in season we'll always have the mango rice for dessert too. All in all after going here for lunch and dinner over the past three years we've had one bad soda served to us and one check a little off. We politely brought it to their attention and it was resolved no problem. Five stars without a doubt!",

Ok, I know what you're thinking, but if you can get past the sketchy location, and less than par ambiance, this place has the BEST Thai food I've ever had. (And I've had a lot).  The tom-kha and tom-yum are out of this world good. I feel like the lemongrass soup is spicier just because there isn't the coconut milk to cool it down. I like mine to be so spicy I either cry or get the hiccups. Every time, a 9 makes that happen.   The chicken pad Thai is also a staple, and I can't express in words my affection for the chicken Penang curry (spicy number 9 or 10).   I've ventured off the beaten path to try a couple other items (beef jerky and sticky rice, pad prig khing, pad se-ew, Orange chicken) and they were all super delicious also.   I'm not sure the name of the server we have every time we come in, but she is a delight. Usually remembers our drink orders from the previous visit, and remembers that I'm the crazy spicy girl. I honestly feel like I'm in her home, and she's bringing me super authentic Thai dishes from her kitchen.   We'll be back :) .",

Real Thai food.Food is amazing you have to try this. Not many restaurants in vegas can compare to Thai house. This is a must try. Crispy garlic chicken and crab fried rice is a must try and one of the best. The Thai tea is really good and fresh.

Penn Thai House is without doubt home run, knockout, and STEAMED GREEN TEA BUN real really reallyy make sure have room at the end of your meal, Also knock on wood and cross your fingers because buns so popular just might be out. Thankfully for my first visit they had some!!  I came here for recovery lunch meal with training partner Suzy H for lunch. The lunch specials most part are all your standard ones see at most other Thai restaurants. Talk about cheap deal most of them are $6 something comes with soup, egg roll, and rice. In the same token talk about smaller portion then most Thai lunch specials.  I felt looking at the plate my chicken mint never really filled up the plate and just felt empty. The portion you did get I loved it! Just wished got more on the plate. The spice levels go from 1-10. I got 3. It was nice had slight kick but next time come go up notch or two. I like spicy food. Star the show was those Green Tea Buns. At first thinking Green Tea Buns sounds interesting. I love my Green Tea ice cream and really anything Green Tea. These Buns took my Green Tea love too another level! The steam bun on the outside is moist, hot, and really best steam buns ever had in Vegas. Now the addicting no more justice be Green Tea Custard ecstasy. The custard filling that comes out not only nice hot, creamy, and perfect balance of green tea but not overwhelming just right.  I had no idea which one wanted too attack more? Suck the filling out one shot or take in best of both worlds. All I do know is had two could have had dozen. Really that addicting.   Talk about out in no where and if not looking for it never find the place. But if anywhere near Sunset Station and craving some good Thai food but more so some Green Tea Buns no doubt need too check out Penn Thai House. I know I will whenever am in the area.",

Her apology was 4 slices of oranges and saying 10 more minutes. I think the only reason i would eat here is if i call in an hour before and then go pick it up.",

My soup was way too salty.Oh and my salad had dried out tomatoes(Im from Cali and cant seem to find great tomatoes anywhere)  The chicken satay was very good.. BTW my bill was 56.00 for this and 2 iced coffees. So way over priced. I ordered this to go. Not to mention threres  a hydroponics store right next sore... Bad location..The place was clean and the server was very nice, I will not go back.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in the area and we were craving Thai food.  I was pretty sure there wasn't an Archie's around.  I checked my trusty Yelp App to see if there was any Thai places in the area.  We were right by the Galleria and this place came up.  I started to read the reviews and there are great pics of the dishes too.  We get it on the map and start to follow the directions.  Once we went under the highway, I started to wonder where it was.  I passed it and have to double back.  It is located in a small old strip mall right next to a grow your own weed store, I mean a hydroponics store.  When we pulled up it was dark outside and there was no cars in the parking lot.  We looked at each other and I started to second guess this place.  I looked at the clock and it was only 7:45PM on a Friday night.  I parked and decided that this place was getting great reviews so we had to see why.  We were willing to take the gamble.  As we opened the door there was a lady reading a newspaper and an older couple dining in a booth, that's it.  It is kind of a weird set up because only half of the building is being used for the dining room. We were greeted right away and were seated asked for drinks and menu in hand.    Ok, so I had to order the crispy garlic chicken because that all the reviews talk about.  We also ordered pork pad thai because it's a safe dish to order in any thai restaurant  plus that's what my wife always orders. The service was great here.  Granted the place was empty.  Our waitress was awesome.  When I sunk my teeth into the crispy garlic chicken I was in Thai bliss.  It was just perfect! The outside was incredibly crispy!  The chicken was moist and tender.   I have since had dreams about this chicken dish.  The pad thai was really good too.  The servings were big in size too.    To sum it up.  Archie's Thai Bistro was always our default thai place.  Don't get me wrong Archie's is great, but with this place a little closer to home I am going to get thai food here.  Like I said earlier the place was dead and I am not sure if this some kind of business front or what.  I'm guessing they do a lot of takeout. I am pretty sure if this were to move locations and maybe a little marketing it would packed daily.  On the other hand I kind of want it to stay tucked away and be my own little secret.    Cheers!",

I had the beef panang and it was absolutely incredible! So full of flavor! I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Incredible food and decent prices. Definately going to make this a regular place. By far the best thai food i have ever had, no joke.",

We had 3 appetizers - chicken satay, Crab Rangoon, and summer rolls. All delicious including the sauce that came with them. Had 3 entrees - yellow curry, pad thai, sweet and sour pork. Especially loved that the sweet and sour wasn't your typical breaded and fried mess. Each entree was expertly prepared and delicious! We were full but had to try the green tea buns (also based on reviews) and so glad we did. So yummy, light and not too sweet. The waitress said they don't always have the buns. She said most people have to call ahead and order them. We got lucky!!! We hope to go back again before leaving the Vegas area.",

Service was fine, but for one thing. We got one dish served and the other two dishes didn't come out for nearly ten minutes later. Obviously, we would have liked to have our food served at the same time, or nearly so. Still, I highly recommend the place.",

Overall the portions are too small for the price and standard dishes seem to be skimped on. I left feeling hungry, and I don't eat all that much either. I will officially never be coming back again.

Old school vinyl booths, plain walls, and a large fish tank to most likely distract you from the plain surroundings. I sat down and was greeted with water and a menu. Looking around, there are only about eight booths total with a few tables in the middle of the restaurant and manning all of these tables is one server, the co-owner maybe?   She took my order and within about seven minutes I had my first item ordered, Beef Jerky. These aren't the road favorite you're thinking of, but are strips of skirt steak, marinated and flash fried. These are delicious with a slightly crispy outside and tender, but chewy inside, hence an elevated style of beef jerky, very good and great meal starter. These also come with a bizarre spicy dipping sauce that I couldn't quite my finger one. Sriracha with something else?   I also ordered one of the five lunch specials. Yellow Curry plate with chicken. This comes with egg drop soup, tossed salad, white rice, and a single egg roll for under seven dollars. The curry was delicious, great flavor; color and I really enjoyed the egg drop soup. The soup had a great consistency with a unique homemade flavor. The egg roll was ok, but lacked flavor and was pretty greasy.   The service here was quick and the food was great. I wanted to try their famous green tea rolls, but unfortunately they were out. I'll get you next time... next time.   Can Yelp talk Thai? Yes. Quite well in fact",

The Pad Se Ew and Tom Kha soup are amazing. I really like how spicy yet satisfying the tom kha broth is made here. One order is decent to feed a party of four IF you get additional dishes like the pad se ew or the fried rice. The pad se ew is very good. I've had good and awful pad se ew and this place has to be one of the best-very flavorful not overly chewy.  Get the green tea buns because that's the craze here and very deserving of that.",

This place is known for their green tea bun, but unfortunately the genius behind it left for Thailand, and wasn't around for us to taste any.   GARLIC CHICKEN: Officially one of my favorite dishes. They know how to bread a chicken for this. That's for sure. Extra crispy outer exterior and tender chicken bites on the inside. The sauce is amazing. The consistency is thick, a little sweet, but with that garlic kick. Highly, highly recommend it.  SQUID SALAD: Squid salad was hard to chew threw, I found myself fearing for my life each time I took a swallow because the pieces were so whole and hard to chew. However, the salad is so good. It's what I would expect of a thai salad. I got a level 5 and while I think I have a huge tolerance for spice--I almost died. It's super spicy. I'll definitely go lower next time and recommend a 2 or 3 for those who want just a kick of spice.  PAD SEE EWW: So bomb. Also recommend this. Full of flavor, and the noodles were perfectly cooked.   I would definitely come back, especially to try the green tea bun. If you're the type who likes to adventure outside of the hype (Lotus of Siam or Le Thai), I'd check this place out. It's definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "We always end up at Penn's Thai House when we want Thai. We usually come with the whole family for dinner and take up the entire middle table. Everyone leaves full and the prices are reasonable. We've always experienced consistent food and service.  Aside from the fish tank, the decor is plain, but everyone feels comfortable here because the staff of the family owned restaurant always recognize us and they make sure we have a nice experience. We regularly order Tom Yum Shrimp, Papaya Salad, Beef Salad, Chicken Larb, sticky rice, and any of their curries. We tend to favor the yellow curry with chicken. The papaya salad easily rivals my sister in law's home made. We rarely ever leave with take out boxes and frequently have to order more.  On this most recent visit, I came in with my wife for their lunch specials ($6.95). I had the green curry with pork and she had the yellow curry with chicken. Lunch specials come with a small salad and an egg roll. Spice level is mild, medium, or hot. I ordered hot and it had me working up a nice sweat but it wasn't too much and I was able to finish the dish off. I also ordered a Thai tea which was gone before my food came out.  Service has always been consistent for us but they usually only have one person serving the entire restaurant and occasionally she can get overwhelmed.",

    "text": "So, I have ordered take out from here about three times.  It's so close to my house.  But we hadn't dined in before until tonight.    Started off with the crab rangoons.  Now, from take out, they were amazing.  Dine in, fresh off the heat....I swear that they are little puffs of heaven in your mouth.  The husband had to be paying better attention because he was in a losing battle against me for the 8 on the plate.  I talked him into the Crispy Garlic Chicken.  Saw that Linda S. had it and loved it, so I thought since he was looking for something new (not his normal orange chicken), it would be a good option.  Again, Thai House hit the ball right out of the park.  They were not \"garlicy\" but had such a good flavor that I had to steal two from his plate.    I have had both the pad thai noodles and the red curry in the past.  (The shrimp pad thai was delic, but not enough shrimp.  They were huge, but sparse!)  Tonight, it was the red curry.  It is always a toss up about how spicy is too spicy.  I rate it as clearing up my nasal passages, but not crying.  I continued to eat and it didn't hurt me.  (I have had too spicy pad thai before I had to add peanut butter to at home just in order to get it down.  Now, THAT'S too spicy.)  The red curry had the right taste and spice to make it amazing.  Husband and I stuffed ourselves silly for $34.  Brought home the red curry, garlic chicken, and some left over rice.  We will both have lunch for tomorrow.    While I will likely take out again, it's worth the time and effort to sit down and enjoy Penn's Thai House's amazing food.",

Your food will taste better if you don't see where it came from ;)  Penn's Thai is an old Thai restaurant on Boulder HWY that has been featured in a couple of Las Vegas magazines/websites. The outside is as shady as the inside (hydroponic shop next door and barred up windows for the rest of the shops) and as old as you can get. I don't think I would feel safe outside this restaurant alone, much less inside.  The take-out was okay... The portion of the pad see ew was a little on the smaller side. The pad thai was artificial tasting. The yellow curry fried rice was dry and the chicken tasted a little sketchy. The beef for the pad see ew tasted safer than the chicken.  It wasn't good enough for me to order on my own again, but it was also not so bad that I wouldn't eat it if it were in front of me.",

My favorites are the spring rolls (with mint, yum). The red and yellow curries...delish!  Ginger chicken, so good with lots of ginger flavor!  The Laarb with ground chicken is the best with spices, mint and lime dressing. Pre-order your green tea steamed buns for dessert..(hint they are NOT on the menu you have to ask for them).  I can scarf 4 easy.... I don't understand on another review about no spice level....Lee my favorite waitress ALWAYS asks for spice levels 1 thru 5.  I order medium and its always on the spicy side...(which I like). Its is out of the way in Henderson...and kinda unassuming place.

We ordered three dishes, and I am pretty sure we must have appeared to have not eaten in days given the rate of consumption combined with the fact that there wasn't even a morsel left on any plate.   The only things that were lacking: brown rice and vegetables in the panang. The Thai waitress let us know that in Thailand veggies in panang is just not how it is done, and I appreciated learning this. We decided not to add veggies just to experience the unadulterated dish, but I still kinda missed the vegetables. What can I say? I am a sucker for bok choy.   However, these are tedious complaints because the food overpowers you with scrumptious. We had panang with tofu, pad see ew and the traditional Thai basil chicken dish (Thai name escapes me). We requested to get our chicken sliced instead of ground, and they were happy to accommodate! Of the three, I actually think the Thai basil was my favorite. Lost of basil and teeming with a perfect wok singed flavor. Spice levels were executed well.   All three of the dishes were recommended by the waitress, so I definitely suggest taking her guidance! Service was super sweet and quick.   In conclusion, I would love to eat my way through Penn's menu! Need to plan more trips to Henderson.",

The only thing that was opened was a hydroponics store. I thought this place was gonna be bad news. I was really surprised when the food came out.  The inside of restaurant is really basic. Like a typical Asian restaurant just booths, a fish tank in the front and some basic decor. The food we ordered was thai tea, pad see ew, pad thai, tofu green curry, and thai beef salad.  The thai tea was good not too sweet like how some other places make it. I just wish you got a bigger glass. The pad see ew was really good, we ordered chicken and meat wasnt too dry just cooked perfectly. The pad thai was also really good, the noodles arent too mushy and the beef was also very tender. The green curry was my least favorite i didnt think the curry taste was as strong. The tofu in it was plain and kinda over cooked. The thai beef salad was really good the dressing on it was just right. The beef in that was also cooked perfectly, very tender.  If i am ever in the area i would definitely go back the price is cheap and the food was good and came out pretty quickly. I just live way too far from this place to make frequent trips",

    "text": "My husband and I went to this place for the first time last Friday.  It is in a strip mall that is located on the older side of Henderson.  It is a quaint, little restaurant.  He had the cashew chicken and I had the tom yum soup and chicken panang.  We ordered these mild spicy.  The tom yum soup was exactly what I needed (it's getting colder in Vegas) and it was made well with the lemongrass.  I was surprised that the chicken panang did not have any veggies in it but it tasted good.  Even though I got these mild, they were both quite spicy.  My husband liked his cashew chicken dish.  I was able to try 2 green tea buns - these must be very popular because they were down to 3.  They're also not listed on the menu.  I really liked the texture of these and they came out piping hot!  We will be going back.",

I've never had an egg drop soup Sooo good, it was just the thing I needed for my sore throat. After i finished my soup the main course came. I chose the garlic pepper chicken and it was full of flavor! I would recommend this Thai restaurant to anyone who is in that area",

    "text": "Yes yes yes yes. Talk about a well-kept secret--I have driven by this place every day since I moved here, and didn't know it existed. Maybe it's because the neon on the hydroponics store next door shines brighter, causing me to daydream about Nancy Botwin's antics on the way back home. Anyhow, I finally tried it today, and I was more than impressed. I was also pretty committed to trying Penn's today, as I went in, realized there was a $15 minimum on cards, and walked out and drove to a bank to retrieve cash monies. (I needed the spice, okay? My allergies are killing me. It succeeded--I spent the rest of the afternoon hacking.)  The place is teeny tiny. 10 tables, max, and a fishtank. The service was top notch--smiley, timely, helpful. I was boring and got pad thai as a lunch special, which includes an egg roll and egg drop soup ($6.95, can't beat it). The menu said that the noodle dishes do not come with steamed rice, but I did end up getting a scoop of rice, which went really well with the minty duck sauce(?). My noodles were just a liiiiiitle underdone, bu they were still smashing and I all but licked my plate.   I'm glad that I now have a takeout menu so that I can stop by on one of my daily trips by this place. Can't wait to be more adventurous on the menu!",

We had summer rolls with excellent homemade sauce, Tom Kha and spicy eggplant. Speaking of spice, they are generous with that as well! My husband likes his food a little spicier than mine so we usually ask for medium spicy and he adds chili paste. Medium at Penn 's was just perfect for my husband and while I still enjoyed the food my nose was running  and I was taking extra bites of rice to tame things down. Next time we will ask for mild spice.",

    "text": "I always wondered if this place was opened, because for nearly eight years I passed  this faded green strip center that Penn's is located, but never seen a open sign from the road.     Thankfully,  Jamie W review of this restaurant got my attention.  Penn is very easy to find, and located just a stone throw away east of the I-95 on Sunset road .    So there really no excuse you can't find this place, because even out of state visitors can locate it.  If you can drive to Hoover Dam, you can find Penn's.  Before I start my review of Penn's.   I tried Lotus of Siam, Pin Kaow, Komols ( I know the owners there), Archis, Bangkok Orchid, Bangkok 9, Naga, Keo's and a few other places, but Penn's does curry right, and make the others look pretty bad in Las Vegas.      Service was great, and got there just in time for the lunch specials.    There was quite a bit on their menu, but the old standby of  Red chicken curry and Thai iced tea was on my mind.      I got my ice tea within a couple of minutes, and it was good, but I have to say Archi got them by a hair on this one.    Don't get me wrong, this something I would order any time when I visit this place, because it was very, very good.    Then 10 minutes later, I got my red curry....OMG,  Have you ever had a plate that you didn't want it to end?   This was the dish!      Compared to every other Thai restaurant I ever been too,  this recipe had a had more complex flavor beyond any other Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, Honolulu, or Hilo.     It  had a more paste-like appearance, and was doing a circus in my mouth.      I'm not sure what the Zagat pollster were smoking when they visited that establishment in the Commercial center, and claimed it was the best in on West coast, because Penn's clearly blows them away.     Now, thinking about it....I really blew it for the past eight years, but at least, I got to tryout many of Las Vegas inferior Thai places, before finding this place.  Finally, I met a fellow Yelper when I first visited Penn's, and I guess we notice each other by our avatar.    Yelp is great!",

Thought they were closed but I was really craving a good Thai dish and forged on twisting the handle hard. I would have given this place 4 stars but really the dish wasn't that memorable. The tables looked clean and the staff was friendly but pretty involved in their own convo.   I took a seat in a booth and ordered Pad Thai Chicken. The Thai Ice tea was refreshing. A retail neighbor walked in saying he's watched several people walk away when they saw the couldn't get the door handle to open to this place.   I paid 12.45 + tax for pad Thai and a tea. They stuck on a $1.00 sur charge for not paying cash. $15 minimum to use your card. Eh, guess I missed that on the menu. (Groaning- hate being nickeled and dimed).   It was a fair experience. I do kind of giggle at Thai ladies screaming at each other, although in their own native tongue I would imagine that's just normal conversation. To the outsider it's kind of hilarious how animated they get. I felt like a guest in this ladies kitchen. I don't remember getting a \"thank you\" from her although I did say thank you to her.",

However, one big problem is the location.  Very sketchy.  It's right next to a head shop, and the whole row of stores usually look shut down.  They've gotta find a better location.  We haven't branched out on the menu, but we have or favorites. My husband loooves their Masaman curry. I love the chicken pad thai and spicy soup. Their thai iced tea is the best I've ever had, hands down.  I had Thai food at a different restaurant one time, and was so disappointed that I had to visit Thai House that week just to make up for it.  There's always the same waitress working, which I think is quaint. It has a simple charm, with Asian drawings and statues all over the place.    It is odd to me how we never see other patrons inside.  There have only been two times that someone else has dined in while we're there.  I think most of their business is takeout.  One customer actually made a comment to us that he's glad no one else has found out how great this place is.    Take a chance like us, and you'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "First off, thanks to Yelpers in the recent Thai Talk threads for this find!  This Thai restaurant is listed among the top of several Yelpers who's opinion I trust.  Once again, I was not steered wrong!  I managed to get a few friends to eat family style at this Thai restaurant  this afternoon (is there any other way to eat Thai food?).  We ordered Thai Iced Tea, Tom Kha Khi, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang with Beef, Lad Na with Pork, Garlic Chicken, and Papaya Salad.  All dishes ranged a 4-4.5 for me!  The Thai Iced Tea was not that sweet, and very bold in herbal tea flavor.  Yum.  The Tom Kha was really, really good.  While not the best in town, it was probably the dish I enjoyed the most.   It was creamy, yet savory and lightly sour at the same time.  The complexity of the flavors played off of one another brilliantly.  The mushrooms and chicken were excellently prepared as well.    My second favorite dish was the Beef Panang (thanks, Jade!).  It had a strong, bold flavor for a Panang, with just the tiniest hint of peanut.  It was rather thick as well, and very hardy.  Mixed with the minced Garlic Chicken, it really made the lunch.  The flavor profile was one of the most complex (yet balanced) I have had for a Panang!      The Papaya Salad and Pineapple Fried Rice were pretty good, but not completely mind blowing to me.  The Papaya Salad had an excellent balance of flavor, but both dishes were a little lack luster.  The Pineapple Fried Rice was a tad bit on the soggy side, and was just a little bit boring.  No worries though, everything else rocked!  The Lad Nah with Pork, while again not the best in town, was expertly prepared.  The gravy had a nice thick consistency with beautiful savory flavors.  With added chili peppers and fresh Chinese Broccoli, it was also one of my favorites of the meal.    Overall, this is probably the best Thai restaurant on this side of town.  Not all of the dishes wow'ed me enough to give it a 5 though, and I thought the portions were a little small.  However, if I am on this side of town and am in need of good Thai food, this will be my spot!",

We got here at 8:35 pm and they close at 9, but they were very friendly and welcoming. The food came quickly and they were really good. Even after 9 they didn't rush us and we had a great meal and left satisfied. Will come back again next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "I ordered takeout over the phone 30 minutes before they close at 9 p.m. and was so glad that I did.   1) Papaya Salad (Thai) \"SomTam\" - It comes with the dry shrimp and they ask for your spiciness level from 1 to 10. I said \"3\" thinking there will be a small kick, but if you want to experience any level of heat I think you need to ask for \"5.\" The salad was delicious. It was truly authentic as its best minus the spice.   2) Yellow Curry (Chicken) - Even if it was to-go, the curry was piping hot and the amount of curry I got was amazing. I was beyond full and had enough to feed another person. The flavors were prominent without the pepper since I asked for it to be mild.   3) Green Tea Bun - $1 per bun and you need to warm it up if you take it to-go. I missed the salabao from Thailand, and this is the one I remember from the streets and even the convenience stores. It had a nostalgic taste.",

    "text": "After a lengthy hiatus that included recent visits to some of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, I had to make my long overdue return to the one in my Henderson backyard to see if it was still a reasonable alternative to driving. Thankfully, it is.  Penn's Thai House is still the hole in the wall with unassuming decor in a very unassuming Sunset Rd plaza (other side of the highway from Sunset Station / Galleria). The menu is relatively modest as well. But the servers are nice and the food was good.  Panang Curry ($10.95) with beef was my first choice, and I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it stands up to any of the ones that I've eaten elsewhere. It's not as heavy on the coconut milk as Arawan's, and it has all the spices (at mild heat level, which still had a kick) and richness that I expected. The beef was fairly tender and reasonably portioned, and the white rice carried the flavors just fine.  Pad Kee Mao ($9.95), a dish sometimes referred to as drunken noodles at other restaurants, was my other entree. It looked great and all the noodles, the plentiful pork portion (didn't want beef twice), and the various veggies (tomato, mushroom, carrot, onion, basil) were cooked well. It tasted a little underwhelming though. Maybe it's a mismatch of my palate and their house recipe, but I would call it modestly sauced at best. Definitely at least a notch below Thai Food To Go's version, and a little pricier to boot. Thinking back on prior experiences, I'm thinking that their noodle dishes might not be the best way to go here.  I had two desserts. (Relax guys, I took home leftovers.) The complimentary orange slices were fantastic tonight, with peak juiciness and sweetness. I also finally tried the green tea buns ($1 each, or $5 for 6, or $10 for a dozen in a foam box) and liked them in spite of the green tea flavor being subtle at best. It's a lightly sweet green paste sealed inside moist typical white \"bao\" dough, and it's strangely addictive.  While I still wouldn't suggest driving from across town for Penn's, it's a good stop for Thai food if you live in this part of Henderson or are otherwise already in the area. I know I won't wait 2 more years this time around.",

As is my habit when hitting a Thai place I haven't tried before, I ordered a variety of dishes.  Flavors hit the right notes pretty much across the board and it was a very satisfying meal.  Will definitely stop by again when I'm in the neighborhood.",

Even our server was not as friendly as the help usual is here. If you decide to go here, I'd pass on the pad thai unless really sweet is your thing.

We got there a little bit before they were going to close, so my experience may have been lessened by the fact that i had to rush and shove the food in my face as quickly as possible. The girl working there was super nice and genuinely interested in feedback and our experience at the restaurant. I had the pad woon sen and boyfriend had pad kee mao. His dish was a lot better. Mine was good but fell a bit short in the flavor department -- it was plain and the chicken was dry and tasteless. The pad kee mao was good with just the right amount of heat. I did not care to try the curries because after making my own, I realized how idiot proof making a delicious curry really is. In flavor department Naga wins out by a high margin, but service wise Penns definitely wins. I will go back and sample more of their dishes.",

    "text": "I'm hopin' my True fellow yelpers know, this be the quickest review I ever wrote.  I felt the need to write this almost immediately upon finishing my meal because this was purely a Yelp driven in the sense that I would have never tried this place if it wasn't for all the great word of mouth and reviews (I think Jaime W. has received enough credit for this don't you?   I'll give a shout out to Matt S for quite possibly the funniest review I've ever read instead.  Just kidding, it was pretty much all Jaime).   So I always do my research before trying a place for the first time.  I saw all the rave reviews for Panang Curry and several of the noodle dishes which all sounded insanely good to me, and I promptly ordered...... the yellow curry with pork.   Yes I went against the majority of my trusted Yelpers (though a few did give it love) and instead ordered based on a google search for the menu result leading to a Max Jacobson review that called the Yellow Curry THE BEST CURRY IN LAS VEGAS.  I mean, I just had to.  If I read a food critic tomorrow tell me that Applebee's had the best piece of salmon in Las Vegas, I'd have to go even though I'd normally rather go to the a dumpster behind UMC for a meal.  Well, I honestly was disappointed.  I've written at length about expectations in the past and they were sky high for this particularly after that Best in Las Vegas business.  I asked for it \"sort of hot\" because they asked me to choose between mild medium and hot.  I've also written extensively about my hatred for these types of scales because I feel limited, and this didn't come very spicy to me at all.  0 beads of sweat throughout the entire meal.  Next time I'll try hot I guess, and hope it doesn't melt my face off.  I didn't think the pork was extremely tender and the curry wasn't thick at all and I just didn't taste much depth to it. The potato chunks were large and tasty, so that was good.  Overall it tasted average, and I expected much more than average.  So I know you're thinking, why on earth did I give this 4 stars for an average dish?   Well, I also had the wherewithal and foresight to also order a small order of the Tom Kha with Shrimp.   YES.  This is what I'm talking about.  Without a doubt the most complex, delicious Thai soup I've ever had.  An explosion of flavor that seemed to change as I kept eating, sort of like what I've heard a good scotch is like if I wasn't too wimpy to drink it straight.  And the shrimp, even though there were only 3, were huge, fresh, and absolutely amazing (and no shells to peel off!).   This is a must order.  Final thoughts: Though the curry disappointed me, I feel as though I should have gone with some of the more reviewed items like panang or a noodle dish which I will try next time.   The Tom Kha soup shows me there are amazing things going on at Penn's and warrants future investigation.",

I love thai food but am tired of all the pomp and circumstance vegas food establishments have. vegas eateries and customers alike seem to think that the better, flashier, newer, more money spent on, and froo-froo a place looks = good food. no so. there are many hole in the wall mom and pop establishments that have amazing food but fail to get recognition because of appearance. sadly not many make it in this town.   the food here is ridiculously delicious, authentic thai food served at a great price. during both visits, we collectively ordered yum woon sen, pad thai, crab Rangoon, mango sticky rice, thai iced tea and thai iced coffee  yum woon sen - this one sealed the deal for me. it's hard to find a place that's not afraid of the fish sauce and lime dressing. this salad was pungent, flavorful and done right with both shrimp and ground pork. the level of spiciness is something I have to get right. mild had no distinguishable kick and thai spicy was fine for the husband. next time, we'll try medium for me and see if they have anything more spicy for the husband.   pad thai with chicken and tofu - their pad thai rocks! great balanced flavor, not overly sweet, chewey noodles and an abundance of your protein of choice which was chicken and tofu for me. I ate the whole frickin container. don't judge.   crab Rangoon - typical and standard. crispy wontons filled with flavorful cream cheese, crab and onion. addiciting and yummy, it's the perfect snack.    mango sticky rice - this was great too. the rice was cooked well without any hard, uncooked pieces of rice (which I've had the misfortune of having) it was both creamy and firm, sweetened nicely with the rice giving a great balance to the mango's sharp flavor. must get.  thai iced tea - super good. ordered one while waiting for the food and it was gone on 2.5 seconds. I've recently found myself taking a break from thai tea. a lot of people want to serve it, but not everyone knows how to do it right. so I abstain. until now. it's really good y'all  thai iced coffee - strong, creamy and S W E E T, this is great stuff. I like some now and some later so I split the drink between 2 20oz cups, top it off with milk and refrigerate the second one for the next day. still insanely potent, still sweet and delicious.   great job Penn's Thai House, you've got a new regular.",

I know this place is in a run down strip mall, but trust me the best restaurants always are.   They have a great menu with all your Thai favorites and some yummy sounding appetizers. I've been on a Curry kick as well so I chose the Red Curry Beef and Joel ordered the Spicy Fried Rice with Pork. We've also ordered the Pad See Ew on other visits.  My favorite thing about Penn's Red Curry is that it has a hint of sweet, but it's not the main flavor. The spice is what you taste with that wonderful coconut milk. Joel's Spicy Fried Rice lived up to its name. It had huge pieces of pork and a seriously good spice!  So happy I tried this place. Definitely one of my favorite Thai places in Henderson. Super authentic food and a friendly staff! Yay for Penns!",

    "text": "No relation to Penn and Teller, or UFC fighter BJ Penn, We finally made it to Penn's Thai House after church when we were in the area. We were reluctant at first because of wifey's first visit a few years back when we lived in the Hendertucky area where she popped in to get some take out and found the restaurant empty with a worker crashed out in one of the booths.  Maybe they've switched owners or cleaned up their act because its been creating a little buzz on Yelp. We started off with the Thai style Beef Jerky which was pretty tasty. Thai Thai Iced Tea was perfectly refreshing too.  Next came our Pad thai and Panang Curry. The Panang Curry was good with a slight kick, but a tad too sweet for my liking. I also wished some veggies were included. Our Pad Thai was also good, but was missing the crushed peanuts and lime like I'm used to seeing.This ain't LOS or Komol, but pretty solid food overall, and a plus if you're on this side of town...ALOHA!!!",

My friend recommended the Crispy Garlic Chicken. Oh man does it live up to all its great reviews. I swear the sauce that it's drenched in is like crack. I could never get enough of it! Somehow they get the chicken so soft and tender but it's still perfectly crisp on the outside.   I also got the Pad See Ew lunch special for $6.95. It was really tasty and fresh! The portions were just right too.  Service was fast and the owners were pretty nice! I definitely will be coming back here!",

    "text": "Penn's is a little-known Henderson gem. A hole-in-the-wall place known only by Henderson locals. Located in a dingy area off of Sunset and the 95, you would completely miss this place if you don't know what you are looking for.  The place is small. I mean seats no more than 20 people small. But that's ok - because the food is delicious!   I personally recommend the Kra Prow. Now, this is a spicy dish, so I usually recommend a 2 or 3 on the spice level (unless you particularly enjoy face-numbing burn). They use fresh basil, which gives it a cooling effect.   In addition, the Panang Curry with Chicken is wonderful. The flavor is a creamy over-the top coconutty spice that delights the tastebuds (really, it does).  The only downside - the area, and the decor.",

What won me over was the Yellow Curry with Tofu I had for lunch today. The yellow curry served up here is different from the other Thai place I go to.  The blend of spices used to create their curry is a very rich in flavor,light in texture gravy like sauce.... I loooove it!!!  Cant get enough of it! Lunch portion was just right, served in a seperate bowl enough curry for the two scoops of rice that comes with it.  I only wish though that there was more tofu, less potatoes...I'll ask next time if I can do that.    Ambiance wise it's not a fancy looking place, but what counts is the restaurant is pretty clean from top to bottom.  Also service is very good! Pretty neat my second time here and the server remembered me from the last visit! Oh and how cute are the paper covers of the straws created into flowers or hearts! Made me smile!  Shout out to Yelpers especially Jaime W. and her review!  I would have never known this place existed! I easily drove past it without even giving it a second look.The location is obscure in a strip mall that mainly caters to auto places.  To think they've been here 12 years!! Well I gotta make up for that. I see more Thai lunchin' visits soon!",

They really liked this place after only going one time, and gave a good thumbs up on this place.   It is in a very small and deserted looking shopping center, if you want to call it that... Once you go in it is small, vintage almost, and filled with great Thai decor. No R&B music like my last trip to a Thai restaurant in California. The waiter was very polite, and brought us our appetizers first. I ordered sweet & spicy Thai combo with steamed rice and it was really good. The crab Rangoon wontons were delicious.   The price was decent, and the good was very good. I would definitely come back here again on my next visit to Henderson.",

    "text": "Love this place! My only regret is that it isn't located closer to me so I could go more often! Also, the location is pretty shady so I'd only go during the day and if you have a nice, fancy car, better opt out to ride with a friend (you'll see what I mean when you go there lol). My favorite items from here include the curries, crispy chicken, and green tea buns.   I've tried the yellow, massaman, and panang curries and I highly recommend getting them if you love curry and coconut milk. The flavors are much more apparent in the curry compared to other Thai places I've been to and this is an example of a situation in which I rather get less in quantity, but more in quality. A to go order of the curry is good for 2 meals (and trust me, I eat a good amount) and the dish still retains its good taste even after being subjected to the microwave!  If you haven't done so yet, you gotta try the crispy chicken! I've ordered it a couple of times already and it was almost always super crispy and yummy. The most recent time I ordered it, the shell wasn't as crispy and the flavor wasn't as strong. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was an off day.   Last but not least, the green tea buns! I haven't seen it listed on the menu, but I always ask for it when I'm there. The bread is fluffy and pairs well with the light green tea cream in the middle. I normally don't like cream since it is usually thick and overly sweet, but the cream they make here is so good! I could easily eat 2-3 of these in one sitting, but I usually buy 4-5 of them and eat one after each meal. They cost $1 each.   Overall, I highly recommend checking this place out. The staff is very nice and the food is awesome! What more could you want?",

This curry is really tasty, nice heat, lots of bamboo and basil. Tried all 3 hot buns: green tea, custard, and pork. Loved all 3, and got a dozen green tea and custard to go. The pork bun is really unique; seasoned pork with a hard boiled egg inside. Oh, and had a Chang beer (can't find this beer anywhere). Nice place, a must try when in Henderson.",

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Don't let the dingy & dreary strip mall it is in put you off.  It did me. I kept noticing the place when I was having work done on my car at shops on very-close-by Middlegate and Eastgate Drives. But when I kept seeing it I figured, hey, if it's in a mall that looks as abandoned & desolate as all that ...   Then I noted one of my Yelp colleagues praising it. So I touched base with the people in a couple of those car shops ... and they also gave it the big thumbs-up.   So today I ventured in.   The venue is fairly small and neatly appointed. Certainly presentable for an outing with your work buddies, family and such. There's already some pictures posted here to resolve that issue for 'ya.  Most of the entrees are about $8-$10. But soups, salad, egg rolls and other add-ons come in at $5 to $6 each. Even peanut sauce is $2 extra. And that's where your dinner bill starts its gentle upward-creep (as well as the source of my one-star ding).  My starter was egg rolls (the smaller 3\" ones, but a set of five). They landed on the table scald-the-top-of-your-mouth hot; I had to dunk 'em in my tea to eat them. I entreed the pork Phad Prik Sod. Pretty tasty! Entree Portion-to-price was a fair shake ... barely. The service was gentle, fawning and added authenticity.  When the waiter asked if everything was OK, I told him yes ... except the food at the next booth looked even better. That turned out to be a bowl of curry and some kind of side-dish That's on the list for next time, I suppose.  Not surprisingly, there's a lunch deal here, until 3pm. $7 gets you egg drop soup, an egg roll and your choice of one of ten lunch-sized entrees with a scoop of rice. Sounds as though after drink, tip, tax that's going to come in at about eleven or twelve smackers.   I think I'd recommend you start with the lunch, so you can size up the menu and grub for yourself, before plunging into the deep-end of the pool for a $23 tab out-the-door, as did I.  SUMMARY: The quality of the venue and the food far surpassed what the neighborhood seemed to promise. Check it out.",

I recently read an article by restaurant critic Max Jacobson that identified it as serving the best Thai food in Las Vegas. In a curious twist of fate, Max was sitting at the next booth to ours obviously enjoying his complimentary meal with 2 associates.    We shared orders of green curry and pad prik khing.  Penn makes the curry from scratch rather than using a prepared paste though it proved to be a bit thinner than what we are accustomed to.  The dish included a modest amount of skinless chicken, bamboo shoots, chili, basil and green pepper.   Pad prik khing is a famous Thai dish that we somehow have managed to overlook in the past.  It included stir fried skinless chicken, fresh green beans, chili, kefir lime leaves and curry paste. Both dishes boasted fresh ingredients and flavor warranting a return visit.",

He had the yellow curry with chicken and I had the panang curry with shrimp. We both got medium heat and were happy with the level of spice. Just enought to be a little hot but the flavors still shined. We both liked our dishes but agreed the panang was the winner. So good! I think next time I will pair it with beef, it would compliment it better. We also had crab rangoon as the appetizer. They were decent, not greasy at all which is nice. Top it with a couple of Singhas and the meal was great.  I saw others on Yelp didn't like the portion size. I found the portions to be perfect to fill you up with no extras to take home. I personally don't like having extras since I usually do other things after a meal before going home and hate food to be wasted so a meal size portion is perfect for me.  Sevice was great, decor was average for small diner type place. Price was pretty good, $55+ tip for two meals, app and 4 beers. I'll be back!",

The crisp and light outer shell does not get soggy in the tangy and sweet garlic sauce. I could eat this for days. I wish that I could justify doing so. The pad thai is good.

I could taste the vegetables were fresh and my won ton soup was excellent. The server was very kind and accommodated my picky requirements. I think it's worth giving it a try, and don't be put off by its location, they have low overhead and can perhaps afford better quality foods.",

Hidden in a little semi-industrial center, you won't find this on the beaten path, but it's still conveniently located near the Sunset Rd/US 95 intersection. Reasonably priced, family owned, clean and freshly prepared food to order. We make it a frequent family dinner stop on busy nights. Also, if you have a family member who isn't as much of a fan of Thai food as you are, they have a few options on the menu that are good... but, very mild or basic for that picky eater in your group. I still haven't tried the green tea buns, but hear they are amazing. I'm just always too full for dessert!",

We ordered the pad Thai with beef, mussuman curry and the crispy garlic chicken.   All three dishes were incredible. Surprisingly large portions. Too large, in fact! We almost ate everything in front of us. The only thing left on the table was a spoonful of rice and our chopsticks.   I will definitely be going back!

    "text": "Penn's you are that pair of jeans that just seems to get better and better with every wash. Thai masterpieces keep consistently coming out of this kitchen.  FACTS: I have taken over fifteen close friends to Penn's and every single one of them have been back two or more times. I've also never been disappointed with the spice level or overall delivery of anything I've been served here. That being said, the past two months most times I have gotten takeout and it's still on point.  Latest faves here are the Cashew Chicken, Tom Kha, Pad Thai and as of this evening the Pad Woon Sen. That dish actually inspired me to write an update. The balance of spice level HOT with the coolness of mass amounts of veggies like baby corns, celery and tomatoes mixed with glass noodles and seasoned eggs rocked my freakin world tonight and has been added into the rotation.   Pad Woon Sen <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sUXs9ATmb423TcxgtMalzQ?select=rQ7FSaL5ggQupO_DAD7LQg#MyzsS1JQ39DVzYJQWSRxlA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sUXs...</a>  Penn's has only gotten better with time. Read the press or read my reviews, but I am not the only one throwing props to this place. They even take the time now to make designs out of the straws. For a small fee or a Nordstroms gift card I will gladly show you how she does it. (Mine come out like Special Olympics straw art a lil' bit, but I'm working on it.) The service and food are FIVE STARS every time for me.   Tip: If you have been here ONCE and maybe not had a five star experience, please give them another shot. This place is a treasure from every angle and I personally cannot find fault. If you don't feel the same than just take your ass back to Applebees for a REAL meal.   I take zero credit for discovering this treasure. I will forever be grateful to the foodie who turned me on to Penn's and also to Penn for letting me explore the incredible world of Thai cuisine through her dishes.",

We ordered pad see ew with shrimp, cashew nut with chicken, and their crispy garlic chicken, along with a Thai iced tea. They had a copy of a newspaper feature at the entrance that was done on their restaurant. They raved about their food, and I know why. The pad see ew wasn't like many noodle dishes you get from, where the noodles are either very greasy with oil, or the noodles are just stuck together with a bland sauce.   The crispy garlic chicken - I try not to eat much fried food, but it was so delicious, I gobbled this chicken up! I think the only thing I didn't particularly care for was the chicken cashew nut. It was tasty, yet the sauce was watery and the serving was quite small, made with more cashew nuts than chicken. However, their menu has good selections to choose from and very decent lunch specials.  This place is definitely off-the-beaten path, in a corner of a deserted strip mall close to Gibson. But if you're in Henderson close to the 95 or Sunset, I'd highly recommend coming here for Thai food. Our server was very personable and patient, even when I was very indecisive about what to order, which happens to me a lot!   I'll come back for their panang curry soon...",

My hubby ordered the chicken chow mein. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things? It was less than impressive. The egg rolls were ok. Not much flavor. The chicken chow mein literally tasted like cup o' noodles. Plus noodles were a little mushy. The garlic chicken wasn't much better. It was not the traditional garlic chicken that I often order at Thai restaurants. It was small pieces of chicken battered and fried with a garlic sauce poured in top. The chicken was very dry inside. The most enjoyable part of the meal was the white rice. Never coming here again.",

Then there was an apparent change in management or ownership/cook and there was another slight drop. Recent months there were some changes again (ownership/cook?), and there was a noticeable changes in the authenticity/taste of the food for the worse. There was an improvement n presentation but the service was below what it was and it was average (for an Asian restaurant) then.This evening I went to have dinner and the waiter was a nice young man who was obviously new to his job as he didn't bother to ask how spicy I'd like my food, and when asked about it he said to use the spices on the table to get the food to the level of spiciness that I want.Very strange policy. In summary, the food was 2/5,service was2/5,and the presentation was 3/5. The original Penn's Thai was 4.5/5 in food and 3/5 in service and presentation.

Penn is an amazing chef and the ingredients in the dishes taste like direct from Bkk.  My fav is the Crispy garlic chix - succulent boneless chix lightly battered with a savory sauce.  I like also that they include a selection of condiments at the table to add per your discretion. The Pad Thai is nicely balanced and the Larp is full of layers of flavor and do not skimp on the fresh herbs!  Yum",

It came with a side of uninventive vegetable egg roll, bowl of soup (extremely salty), and some rice. The tap water really tasted like tap that I could not continue to drink it. Instead I ordered some Thai Iced Tea which was actually the best item during that lunch. I think I'll give their dinner item another shot since many yelpers had a positive experience. Until then!",

    "text": "First things first, I gotta give a shout out to my girl Jaime W. for telling me about Penn's Thai House! It's not our #1 pick for thai food in Vegas (nothing beats Komol for my hubby!!) but it's really close to our house and the Penn (the owner) is fabulous.   The location isn't the best, but that can be said about some of the other fantastic thai places in town, like those in Commercial Center. This isn't a fine dining establishment by any means. Aesthetically, the place could use a little work.  But for people that like take out, Penn's is fab!   Unlike some places in town, when you request your meal hot at Penn's, you are going to get it hot... regardless of your ethnic background. My husband likes his food HOT, to the extent that he will break out in a sweat halfway thru his meal if it was done right.. Not only has he always been happy with the heat factor on the food he has ordered from Penn's, but the owner goes above and beyond and will package up containers of the different spices and chilis so if he needs a little extra OOMPH, he can add it. She does this without us asking, just because she remembers his request for hot food from the very first time we went in.  I am not a big fan of spicy foods, in fact I'd go as far as to say I am a wussy when it comes to the heat. Penn's still keeps me happy with their delicious egg rolls, tasty stir fries and, mmm is there thai tea ever good!   If you find yourself out in Henderson, craving some spicy thai grub, give Penn's a try.",

The service is very professional and the foods were all served with a pleasing presentation. The Tom Yum soup tasted wonderful. The Pad Thai was delicious and the satay chicken appetizer was very tasty.",

Papaya salad was so spicy, lol I honestly couldn't focus for about 15 minutes.   The mango sticky rice: the mango was slightly rotten, (dark gray mold) and the rice was sticky but salty! Oh and the water here is HORRIBLE.",

    "text": "Really excellent Thai food.  It's not the closest to me, but when I'm in the neighborhood, it's good for takeout, as it's close enough to be hot when I get home.    My husband always gets Pad Thai and always loves it.  He loves it so much that he's never  let me taste it, so I can't say much about it.  :) I typically get Pad See Ew.  Most of the time it's great; this last time it was mediocre.  The noodles and meat are always pretty good, but this time the broccoli was a little bitter - maybe it was old, maybe it was over cooked, but some pieces of it were almost inedible.    Despite this, we will go back. The food is consistently good.  I agree with some of the other posters about the servings getting a bit smaller.  I'd like them to go back to the \"regular\" size.",

    "text": "I enjoyed everything I ordered, but my big complaint is that there was no spiciness option. Every other thai restaurant I've been too lets you choose how spicy you want your food, usually on a 1-10 scale. So while the flavor of everything was great, I would have liked a few dishes to be spicy. I got the Tom Yum with shrimp, eggplant with black bean, beef pad prik khing, and chicken pad woon sen. Besides the lack of spiciness, my only other complaint was that the pad prik khing was mostly green beans, not too much meat.   Will definitely return, and I'd like to try their $6.95 lunch special.  Update: went back the other day and tried the crispy garlic chicken and the pad thai. Crispy garlic chicken was nothing to get excited about, and I thought the portions were pretty small. Bumping this place down to 3 stars from 4.",

Located in a very unassuming strip mall, with only half occupancy, Penn's definitely seems to be the anchor that is keeping the place afloat.  I'm a creature of habit with my Thai lunch food; it's either going to be Massaman or Panang curry with chicken and an Arnold Palmer to wash it all down with.  The meals and the spice levels are very predictable here; it always tastes good, a level 3 is always a level 3 and the service is friendly and accommodating.",

    "text": "So the BF and I were hungry after taking care of one of my errands and I asked what does he feel like eating today? His immediate response is we're only a few exits away from Penns and  got back on the FWY to this little palace of noms.  We ordered:   Beef Panang, spice level something between medium and mild at the BF request and they hit a good level for him. Their curries here are on point. I've only had this and the massaman, but both have been great that I can't imagine the others not being stellar as well. The sauce is fragrant, bold and not watered down at all. I'm hit or miss with sliced beef being tender but the beef here is good. If you're a fan of thai curries this should be on your shortlist. The only other place that I adore curries at is Pan Asian which is our westside answer to humble Thai food and this is the eastsides gem.   Garlic Crispy chicken - crack chicken more like. It's everything guilty pleasures for me - crispy, sticky sweet, garlicky, a bit peppery. It's the grown up version of orange chicken. I add a tiny vinegared jalapeno to each bite and it's awesome balance of sweet, salty, sour, spicy that I like in my food.   Thai ice tea was perfect. Just the right amount of sweet.   Service here was great this time around. I don't know if perhaps this person was the owner but they were running around making sure everything was just right. Food came our fast too and you can hear the food sizzling in the kitchen and being stirred in a wok from our table. Also our drinks came to the table with the paper on the straws shaped into hearts. We also got oranges at the end of our meal, with the vein and seeds removed and notched on the bottom so its easy to eat the whole thing. It's small and cute little details.   Yes, this place deserves the 5 star bump up. I already want to come back for more curry.  Ugh Penns Thai - Y U SO FAR FROM MY HOUSE?! I can seriously come here weekly if we didn't live in the NW, but we will make sure we are hungry any time we have reason to be in this area from now on. Jaimie W. - I love/hate you for letting me know about this place.  (Yelp 100 Challenge 11/100)",

The inside was old,somewhat small but not tiny by any means & there was a certain old smell that wouldn't leave my nose.  How sweet is this? when we got our waters the tips of our straws were twisted into hearts....Awww - look at the picture I posted of it.  So even though I wasn't impressed at all with the state of the restrauant I was however impressed by the taste of the food.  The Tom Kha Soup with Shrimp was Ohh so damn yummy, the eggrolls were good as well. The Pad See Ew with Pork was delicious!!!!  We also ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken and added veggies for a $2.00 charge. We told the waitress 6 times that we wanted potaotes and carrots. Well, when our curry came it was filled with potatoes and broccoli - I told the waitress we ordered Potatoes and Carrots and she said she thought we said broccoli -              Hmmmm..... Let's say it slowly and see if they sound the same:                      C A R R O T S   -   B R O C O L L I - nope I don't hear it.... Anyhow, they added carrots to it but because it didn't cook long enough with the curry it was hard not soft - that sucked..... The taste of the panang curry was right on and the texture of the curry was thick not watery - just how we like our curry - THICK!!!! yeah it was freak'in good.  So, other than the carrots - broccoli mishap we left with our tummies full of yummy Thai food that we would love to eat again.....",

But, it does appear to be a mom and pop family type of establishment with just one woman serving the FOH, so we didn't hold it against them. It also kinda smelled (I think because of the fish tank that was right next to the front tables) but again, it wasn't unbearable... Just noticeable.  Anyways, the food was worth it! Really fair and moderate prices- especially compared to other local Thai establishments- for tasty food & larger portions. I ordered the pad Thai which did not disappoint! I had enough leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day. Their tom yum soup was absolutely delicious, but be forewarned if you can't tolerate spicy- it was HOT! Really delicious though with fresh, large vegetables within.   I would return- good food! Just a little odd inside in an odd location but hey, the food is good so whatev!",

Jaime was sportin' a new 'do and of course the server and the owner greeted her like family.  Apparently her a/c in her car is shifty and Penn's husband, owner of the car joint next door, came for her keys to check out her car while we dined.  Now that's service!  Jaime W. suggested trying the beef nam tok salad, pad woon sen (we got tofu), and panang curry (chicken) - though she had good word to say about everything on the menu she had already tried.  It made narrowing our options hard.  I really want to try the spicy eggplant next time!  The beef salad was very delicious, thinly sliced beef and red onions on lettuce with tomatoes, carrot strands, cilantro, cucumbers, and a spicy lime dressing.  The pad woon sen included glass noodles, fried tofu triangles, baby corn, tomato, green onion, and other veggies - deliciously spicy.  Our panang had a thickness that was sooo good (too many watery curries being served these days)  and great peanut taste, and was served with plenty of steaming hot rice.  I also enjoyed a Thai iced tea which was tasty.  We had just the right amount of heat in all of the dishes (an assortment of hot and medium) and also had plenty of spicy condiments already on the table if needed.  The service was great and I talked to Penn about my trip to Thailand last year, especially about Chiang Rai near her family.  In the end, we had so many leftovers.  Jaime W. took the salad and I got the curry and noodles (load me on those carbs baby!) so I have my lunches covered for the next 2 days.  Best advice: try this place if you haven't.  Even better advice: dine with Jaime!  Lunch specials M-F, but the prices are right for dinner and there are many dishes to try!  I will be back, and hopefully with Jaime!",

It's funny because some parts of how the restaurant and bar next door are set up give me flashbacks of getting kneed in the ribs. Anyway, I had the tom kha gai, pad se ew, and the crispy garlic chicken. The pad se ew was good, the crispy garlic chicken was too sweet for me but I can see why people recommend it. But of course the main event was the tom kha gai, the perfect amount of spice but the coconut milk seemed creamier than usual and wasn't as watered down as some places like Archie's. It tasted very rich and I forgot how flavorful tom kha can be when done right.  The service was A+. The server was attentive, friendly, and even brought out random samples from other dishes to try. All in all I would have to say this place offers some of the best thai food in the city and the service is second to none. The only con is that for me this place is soooooo far and deep into Henderson. It seems like one of those places that may be a hidden secret for locals, but due to its obscure location it is so hidden that it doesn't receive the business it should. I hope they add a second location soon because I don't do very well with long distance relationships.",

    "text": "BLUE COLLAR THAI  It's the closest Thai restaurant to my home. I recalled when it was the foodie hot spot for all of Henderson. Food critic Max Jacobson in 2012 named Penn's Thai House the best Thai restaurant in Henderson. Like finding a diamond on the street. After all it's located in a modest business strip center surrounded by auto body repair shops. It certainly wasn't the aesthetics that brought diners in. Yelpers also flocked in droves too like lemmings. LoL. The frenzy felt artificial. I visited a couple times but never really was stimulated to writing a review.  This most recent lunch visit changed my mind. Not because there was a table of Thai ladies or the Thai servers' mannerism. It was simply the food. Granted the egg flower soup wasn't Thai. But the peanut-less Pork Pad Thai and Thai Boat Noodle Soup just reminded me of what Thai cuisine should truly taste like.  Lunch specials are of excellent value. Noodle soups are delightful and generously filled with expertly seasoned meats.",

I go here so much, I'm pretty sure they know the sound of my voice whenever I call for a to go order.  My go to orders are their Pad Thai, crispy garlic chicken, combo fried rice, and yellow curry.  Pad Thai - amazing flavor, moist  Crispy garlic chicken - amazing! Crunchy, yummy garlic flavor  Combo fried rice - has shrimp, chicken, beef, tomato chunks. Super good on its own and with curry  Yellow curry - creamy goodness! Love the onions in it!  Highly recommended this place ! It's in a weird sketchy auto car area, but don't worry it's really good !",

Once inside there are tables where you can either dine in or get take out. It has been updated a bit, and feels more inviting, and comfortable. It's  definently a laid back casual vibe. They offer you a glass of water even if you order take out. Everyone  who's taken my order was very friendly and helpful with explaining options.    They offer lunch specials that are affordable with generous portions. The regulat menu can get pricey however; the quality makes up for that. My favorite thing to order is the  Crispy Garlic Chicken . It is more sweet than garlic flavored.  However, my kids love it.When not ordering the lunch special I order extra rice . We like pineapple and  vegetable rice.    I will continue to visit, when I have then craving for crunchy, sticky chicken!",

But upon arrival and reading the menu I was very confused considering chow mein and beef and broccoli are not Thai. So now I am skeptical...  I only ordered two dishes. I'm feeling under the weather so I had to get the Tom Kha and the server recommended the Crispy Garlic Chicken. The Tom Kha was very good and better than a lot of places in town.   Here's where my disappointment sets in... the crispy garlic chicken.. what do you imagine it will be?? It came in a bread basket with a banana leaf which I thought was odd presentation. But to stay on track, it was a bowl of sugar. Yes, it was crispy.. but I did not find a garlic flavor. It was literally candied chicken. I ate two pieces and couldn't fathom eating any more. I've never had a Thai dish with this much sugar but I have had multiple Chinese dishes slathered in sugar and sauce.   I can't say that I will be back, but I did have high hopes to find a new hole in the wall. But these dishes do work for others, but it's just not for me.",

    "text": "What a gem! After living off wraps and cold sandwiches for three days in the Zion and Bryce wilderness, we needed some hot wholesome food before our flight out of Vegas. And no, we wanted to stay away from the strip and not let it overwrite the nature images in our head. This was tucked away from the strip, about 15 mins from McCarran Airport. Started with a Tom yum soup that soothed our tired, hiked out bodies and minds with every sip, followed by Panang curry and Pad Kee Mao. The entrees were delicious, so different from their versions I've had at other Thai places. The soup had fresh lime leaves, galangal, bamboo shoots and it was oh so refreshing! The husband had listened to an audiobook on eating out where the economist author talks about how the best, most authentic Thai eat-outs are hole in the wall, family run joints off a highway, strip mall or some unpretentious place. Now we know what the author's talking about!",

The Tom yum soup here has all the authentic ingredients like lemon grass(it's for flavor, you don't want to eat the lemongrass pieces), kafir leaves, galangal root pieces (you don't eat them also)... Everything we ordered were excellent, jumbo shrimps in the fried rice and Tom yum soup, pad se eew was not too sweet like 99% of the Americanized Thai restaurants I eat in Orange County. I've been to Thailand many times and also cook every day so I think I know a few things about Asian food.",

The first time we ate here the Tom Yum Soup was really good but not as sour as my wife and I usually like. We took the advice of previous reviewers and asked her to make it more sour the second time around....Boom! It was perfect.   The Penang curry was on point, as the mixtures of flavors marry together in a hearty harmony. As a matter of fact, every other dish we had (fried rice, Thai tea and the pad Thai) also brought about a similar reaction.   Another key thing here is that the food not only had flavor, but were also cooked or presented just right. None of that commercial, over-sweetened stuff you find at other places. Service is excellent and the owner here is a very sweet, pleasant lady.  The 45 minute trek is across the valley is well worth it! Highly recommend. Anything other is your loss.but",

It was not a lunch special price, but it seemed to be a lunch special SIZE.  This was not very spicy (requested 10/10), and the pork used was cut THICK and chewy. I'd pass on this next time.  Also had the Pad Thai lunch special. Good version of this dish...portion was fair for the lunch special and price....also comes with a cup of Egg drop soup.  Tons of white pepper inside it, but it was pretty good!   If you are in the area during lunch, I would recommend it.  Otherwise, I'd pass personally.",

    "text": "Wow! Worst New Year's Eve meal ever!!! We came to Vegas for New Years Eve, but I got sick. So we skipped the buffet and I though Thai would be good. Yelp a place with 4 stars and called for directions. Being it was the holiday and this was the first time my husband had gotten me out of the room he let me order the spring rolls and my green curry while he got something like sesame chicken. Three dishes all approximately 8.00 each. When it arrived we got one bowl of rice that was half full.                                                                 I questioned the rice and she told me she had given us a large bowl, about 1 quart, instead of the cup so we could share. It was not enough to finish the meals. So I asked about more rice and was told that it would be $2.00 to get a small cup and $4.00 to get what we were given.                                                                                I love Thai food and have eaten it all over the country.  From New York to Florida, California to Atlanta. I have never before received a spring roll with ZERO meat, no shrimp, nothing. The sauce was good but for 7.95 for two I expect expect at least half a shrimp.  The green curry was really taste, what I ate before I asked for enough rice to finish it and the owner ripped the meal away from me. That was a crazy experience I had never had before. She ripped it away and said I was trying to get a free meal all over town.  I am just sick and having a early New Years Eve meal. I guess its Vegas.",

Penn's is located in a rundown strip of businesses where the bright green neon is only partially lit so it's easy to find. Walking in you feel like you are stuck in an 80's restaurant with oversized booths, bad decor, horrible lighting and a sad looking fish tank. Getting so many good reviews I was looking forward to the food. I really liked the crispy garlic chicken, I wish I had two orders of it. The Pad Thai just ok. It left a sour pickling taste in my mouth that I never experienced before. The fried was was a let down. Very bland and the beef was grey in color. The service was a bit slow. There was only one women taking care of the entire place. She may have been the chef as well for all I know.I wish I had the experience some others had since I live relatively close but it looks like a little bit of a drive is needed for something more satisfying.",

There was some pad thai, tom yum kai soup, and red curry chicken. It looks like just about any other hole in the wall thai restaurant does-- a few plants and statues and a modest area for seated guests. It's the kind of place that is more packed for lunch on a weekday than dinner.  The pad Thai wasn't bad. Chewy, sweet and flavorful-- it was satisfying but not particularly memorable.  The tom yum kai (red soup) was fantastic-- probably even better than the one I enjoy regularly at Pin Kao. I don't think it was too meaty but it was very tangy and clearly must have contained copious amounts of lemon grass.  The red chicken however, was rather disappointing. It was finely diced, similar to the way this dish is served at Mix Zone Cafe. Spicy enough but not juicy enough, and it just didn't pan out for me.  To be fair, I i only tried these few items and have not yet returned to see what else these guys have to offer. I wouldn't be so quick to write these guys off, but until I investigate them further I'll have to keep them at 3 stars.",

Once we parked and entered the air-conditioned restaurant, we were greeted by a fish tank full of fish and the lovely server who showed us to a booth. We ordered the large Tom Yum soup (mild spice level with chicken) $9.95 and the Pad Thai (mild spice level with pork) lunch special which came with a bowl of fluffy white rice and fried hot and crispy egg roll $6.95. The large soup was enough for four bowls worth of soup, so we were able to enjoy seconds of this delicious hot and sour soup. The Pad Thai was sweet and savory, peppered with pork, scrambled egg, onion and crisp mung bean sprouts. I wish I could make white rice as light and fluffy as they do here, but that seemingly simple skill eludes me. For dessert, we had the steamed green tea buns. The bun was as good as the best buns I've had in San Francisco's Chinatown. The green tea custard filling was silky smooth and lightly sweet, not cloyingly sweet like most vanilla milk custard buns I've had at SF Chinatown dim sum restaurants and bakeries. I should know because I've eaten more than my fair share! The interior of the restaurant is clean and basic, typical of most small business type restaurants. I thought the prices were on par for the good food and good service, plus I didn't have to pay extra for \"trendy\" atmosphere. I would definitely add this restaurant into my work week lunch rotation if it was closer to work.",

We waited for what seemed like 20 plus minutes for someone to take a drink order or greet us.  In that time 3 other tables got up and left while a woman busied herself clearing dishes.  Still no drink order or acknowledgment.  3 stars for the food smells.  1 for the crappy location.  1 for the horrible decor.  1 for the fact that we were forced to leave and eat at mediocre Pei Wei because the 3 people eating at Penn's somehow overloaded their staff.  They could serve Lotus of Siam quality eats for $5 a plate and we wouldn't go back.",

None the less I still come here for the Yellow Curry and Pad Thai, I am white so I don't know a whole lot about quality Asian Cuisine but this gets it done for me. I am still wondering about their \"award winning\" green tea buns that they still never have had in stock.  Service is garbage they usually seem like they always forget someones food but thats the trade off for quality Thai food I guess!",

The decor isn't the greatest but who cares - I'm there for the food. And the food is exceptional.   The wait for the food was a little long for a lunch hour but it was well worth. Everything we ordered looked and smelled awesome and was cooked perfectly. We had the spring rolls, minced beef and chicken pad thai. We enjoyed every last bit of it.   We got the lunch portions and it came with egg drop soup. Very yummy and the portions were perfect for lunch.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone.",

I tasted everything on the table and they were all pretty grubbin'.  Decided to try out their thai iced coffee and that went down to the gut rather quickly.  Sweet and savory makes for an awesome thai coffee!!  Small, peaceful, and not bad on price for a lunch special.  Server was attentive with refills and very nice throughout the duration of our stay.  Will be back again to try some of the other available entrees so stay tuned!",

    "text": "We really like Thai and wanted to try a place we had not been to yet.  In looking for places and reading reviews, I came across this place that had a review written by Nate M. about 3 months ago.  It was a decent review, he gave it 4 stars so it had to be a decent place.  The place is tucked in the corner of this L shaped shopping center on Sunset east of the 95.  The Penn was a little hard to see but the Thai House is very prominent.  They have 8 booths and a few tables which where put together as two long tables going down the center.  There was one other booth with 3 people and one table was taken with 4 people.  It seemed liked there was only one lady working the room and from time to time another lady brought out food, she looked like she was in the back cooking.  I ordered the Egg Rolls to start and even though the were very crispy in the outside, the were soggy on the inside and obviously not made there, they all looked identical.  These were not really to my liking so I won't order those again.    We also ordered the green papaya salad which was very good and almost identical to a place in Oceanside we love.  We also got the mixed vegetable with chicken and the Pad Thai.  Both dishes were excellent.  The sauce on the mixed vegetable was AMAZING, it was not a heavy sauce and was very week made.  The Pad Thai was very good as well.  This is a place we will go back to, everything tasted fresh, the vegetables were crispy and overall the price was very reasonable.",

So after 45 minutes driving, we are on the look out, we drive right pass the small little shopping center.    But we finally arrive and walk in, no one here except the staff. We get seated and take a look at the menu, by this time my stomach is growling so I'm hoping the food is good.  We got crispy stuffed chicken, very crunchy and dipping sauce was sweet chili. We also got a fat noodle dish, pad see ewe with chicken, this had some good flavor!  We had to try the panang beef curry, it was decent and to finish it off we got the pork with green beans. Our spice level is always about a five and I thought it could be under spiced.    Good service, food had good flavors, place was clean, it was a bit of a drive, but if on that side of town, a stop for sure.",

    "text": "What a delicious lunch I had here.  It's pretty small. I'd say it looks pretty hole in the wall. Most of the seating is booths and there are some Thai artwork on the walls. There was only one woman serving and hosting. Which kind of was lame. All things aside the review is ultimately for food and then the cost related to the experience.   I had a Thai tea for $2.50 which was really good! Some places miss the actual tea flavor. This was the perfect size for the prize  and the flavor was really good. This is probably my favorite Thai tea in town.  We got the stuffed chicken wings aka angel wings as a starter.  For $10 I thought the wings could be bigger. It came with two. Maybe add a third one or make the two bigger. They were good. Came out hot and with sweet and sour sauce. A solid 4 out of 5.  For entrees we had pad se ewe, boat noodle soup, and their garlic chicken.  The beef pad se ewe was really good. Probably the best pad see ewe I've ever had. The flavor was really good. It was perfectly cooked with a nice flavor from the wok if you know what I mean. It wasn't too greasy or overly salty. My one complaint would be the small serving size. I believe this was $10 or $12. That is a good price but the amount just seemed a little small. It could have had more noodles, Chinese broccoli, and or more beef.   The garlic chicken was really good! This is served with white rice and is really just addicting. It's basically the same orange chicken concept but with a different sauce. The sauce is so good! It's garlicky and really balanced in my opinion with some slightly sweet notes.This is $10 and could be easily shared by two people if you get extra rice.  Last we had boat noodles. Boat noodles are like the super awesome Version of Thai style pho. It's served in Thailand at the floating market off of boats hence the name. The broth is really dark and rich. There is also liver, beef slices, rice noodles, and meat balls. I say this isn't for everyone but I thought it was so good! It had so much flavor. This was $8 bucks which I think is a good price for such a complex bowl of noodle soup.  Our service was good. She was slow to get to us but she was alone. She could have checked on us a bit more and refilled out drinks more. She did make sharing easy for us by bringing an extra soup bowl and plates so I can't complain.   Overall I had a really good lunch here. The food itself is a solid 4.5 for sure. Just a small MINOR gripes if I want to nit pick. The one thing keeping me from making it a five is that they were understaffed and the prices. Just at a glance at the menu and the serving size of a couple of our dishes I think the prices on certain dishes could be a little lower.",

But then there were some issues...and the love was lost. But after wandering through the wilderness of bad Thai food on the East side of Vegas the craving for good Crispy Garlic Chicken became too much. And the lure of their spices and the Chili Mint Chicken and Panang Curry with no equal anywhere I've been (including Komol which comes pretty dang close) brought me back again. I spend way more than I'd like when I order my food to go. But when I get my white plastic bags of Thai goodness home and open it up...I forget about the money I spent as I'm back in love with some of the best Thai food I've ever put in my mouth.   For 3 years and having spent North of $4000 dollars and counting...I keep coming back to Penn's.   5 Stars - This place is so good it earns a place on my \"Mythical 6th Star\" list and my Best of Las Vegas list where they belong.",

    "text": "Let's just say my fear of Thai food has come to an end. A few years back I became quite ill from an unnamed Thai place here in Las Vegas. It's last name rhymes with I am. I have not had Thai food since then in fears of the same episode. That was not the case at Penns. Although I was fearful of ordering curry maybe in the future I will. This little gem is a short drive from my home and is truly a great Thai spot in Henderson. I'm no Thai expert but I enjoyed the dishes we ingested. I wanted to order the crispy garlic chicken cliche right? I wasn't sure if it was deep fried even though I probably should have asked. We went ahead and ordered ........   Seafood soup which had a rich and flavorful but light broth. With bright flavor a of lemongrass and the heat from Thai chili.   Beef Salad - tender beef atop iceberg lettuce, cucumber, tomato, cilantro and a flavorful and addicting delicious light dressing. Soooo good. I couldn't get enough of that.   Pad Prik Khing - chicken stir fried with fresh green beans and jalapeno, kefir lime leaves and a curry chili sauce. This was super spicy. My lip was numb after from eating this dish. Be careful to because they slice the jalapenos almost the same size as the green beans so if you're not paying attention you will be eating those as well. The dish is spicy enough from the sauce so I didn't want to ingest the jalapenos as well. I did enjoy it even though it was quite zesty.   I was sure to save room for green tea buns and in so glad I did! These soft and delectable buns with a warm and sweet custard like filling. Almost like the Chinese custard buns but better. I even took some more to go they are seriously heavenly.   The only con to this restaurant is that the dishes do not come with rice. Had we known that we would have ordered fried rice after ordering a few sides of white rice. Other than that this a place I know I will be back to. Crispy garlic chicken and papaya salad will be next on my list!",

    "text": "More like 3.5 stars rounded up based on my experience. First of of all, they are located in kind of an obscure place alongside other businesses. If you werent actually looking for this place you will have never known these guys were here.   When you come in the place does not look like a typical Thai setting. You know like some kind of Buddhist doll statue or painting of some sort. I do admit though their menu is nicely organized and has pictures for your visual reference.  I came for lunch so specials for this time frame is what I look for. They have a decent section on the menu for 6.95. Your choice of entree whether its pad thai, chow mein, chili mint, etc. Then you choose the type of meat whether its pork, beef, chicken, or tofu. Comes with eggdrop soup, eggroll, and steamed rice. Refer to my pic for the complete details.  What I got was Mongolian Chicken. The Eggdrop Soup came in a standard small cup. It was hot and flavorful. Would of been even better if it was my soup of choice which is Hot n Sour. The Eggroll was really good. Crispy on the outside with accompanied by the semi crispiness of the veggies inside. Dipped in the sweet chili sauce it comes in only makes it taste better. As for the main course, I thought it had good flavor to it. The carrots were cooked just right where it's still a bit crispy but soft enough to chew easily. Only thing lacking I thought was the portion size.  Since I had my eye on the tofu appetizer, I ended up getting that because I was not yet quite full and my love for tofu will always be there. When it came out I was very pleased with how the tofu was cut into perfect small squares and cooked to golden crispy perfection. Of course you gotta have the sweet chili sauce with crushed peanuts to dip in. You can eat it by itself but the sauce is the Ying to its Yang so dont be afraid to drown those suckers in that bad boy!  Service was very good. From the moment I was greeted all the way to the moment I paid, I didnt really have to ask for anything except order the tofu.  In closing, this is a solid place for that Thai food craving any time you are in the area. Just dont forget how they are situated in this weird plaza/strip area. Next time, I am getting the Garlic Chicken for sure. Oh, and paying for your meal with plastic there is a 15 dollar minimum. You can still pay with plastic still even though its under 15. They just throw in a dollar fee for the convenience of you not carrying cash.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #104 \"Thai Me Up!\"",

It also had bees long pieces of something that felt like straw. I don't know how you could possibly eat them. Also, there was very little chicken.  I also ordered the spring rolls. They were not firmly packed and we're very mushy on the inside. They didn't taste bad they just didn't taste good!  My main course was pad Thai chicken medium spicy. It really lacked in flavor. If I was ever to return to this area I absolutely would not return. As I write this review, I wonder why I am not giving it two stars. Maybe I am being too nice.  On the positive, the person that waited on me was extremely courteous and pleasant.",

    "text": "Came here at 7 on a Saturday night and it's completely empty. We were greeted right away and given menus. Prices are decent, I'm used to SoCal prices but prices here are comparable. $10 for a large tom Kha chicken soup, $10 for need pad see ew and $9 for boat noodle soup.   I noticed that they had lunch specials from 11-3pm for only $6.95.   9 booths total and 2 tables in the middle. Very small restaurant located in a small plaza that can easily be missed.   I think we were given tap water because the water had a weird taste.   Pad see ew had a lot of meat but it was kind of sour. We always order pad see ew when we go out and my sister did not enjoy the pad see ew here. When we got home she added more soy sauce. When the tom Kha came out I had to ask if it was a large because it seemed smaller than what we were used to. Again, sour but good. Chicken was soft and plentiful.   DO NOT ORDER the boat noodles if you do not like liver. My sisters BF was feeling sick and we thought the boat noodle was kind of like pho because we ordered them in other restaurants before. It didn't look very appetizing when it came out and needs bean sprouts or more veggies in it. I didn't enjoy the broth but I took it to go and just ate the noodles and meat/liver.   Really great service but portions are kind of small for the price.",

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The decor was rather old, and a bit plain but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The location is a bit on the rough side, having all of the automotive shops and smoke shops don't really help either.  I ordered the red vegetable curry lunch special, 4/5 spice, with a Thai coffee on the side. The meal started with a small cup of eggdrop soup, It was delicious. The spice level for the curry was a little on the hot side but that's how I like my curry. I was surprised that they included peppers in the curry that for me is what made the meal better than the rest. There was also an egg roll and salad included. I was kind of hoping they made their own dressing for the salad but it was ranch, which I like anyway.   I would recommend stopping down here and checking it out! The food is delicious!",

Didn't think any of it as I got to my office and begin to eat my food there was a menu attached to the bag. Out of curiosity I decided to look for the price on shrimp fried rice and it's was was $12.69 or something like that. So I decided to call the restaurant again. I asked the gentleman that supposedly took my order and have him repeat my orders he confirmed that I did place an order for shrimp fried rice and then asked him what was the price he said roughly about $13 so I asked him Did you guys have Giants shrimp is that why you guys charge me $16. Hey says I'm sorry I charged you for the crab fried rice but I will make up to you when you come back next time I will give you a free thai tea. First of all it wasn't free I paid for it Second... what ever happened to mr. customer I have your exact change please come back and pick it up. So I told him listen if you want to tip asked for it don't overcharge me (I'm picking up my food and eating it in my office). Very unhappy and disappointed experience. Will Never go there again",

We arrived and it looked a little run down in a off looking plaza but that made iy even more authentic.The food looked good on yelp and it was. It was authentic and very tasty. The customer service was great and they spoke english very well. Definitely our favorite thai place so far and definitely recommend. We got the beef and beef ball soup and pad thai.",

I could have done without that as I don't care for fish.  Fish smell aside, I love the hole in the wall feel of this place.  Sometimes it is these little places that knock out the best food.    I ordered my food to go.  An order of egg rolls and chicken pad se ew.  It took a long time to come out.  I was getting impatient in my current state of hunger.  But the hostess was friendly and gave me a couple of ETA updates.  When I finally got my food about 20 minutes after I ordered, she even apologized for the delay.    The whole way home I could smell the food and it was good.  I didn't have to go far but I just couldn't wait any longer.  I broke into the egg rolls.  Not bad.  Sort of average or slightly above when compared to others I have eaten in my time.  What I was really looking forward to was my pad see ew.  Its my favorite.  I wasn't so sure about it on first bite.  I didn't get much flavor.  But the more I ate the more I realized I was really enjoying it.  I was upset when I was done.  I wanted more.  I wasn't even really hungry at that point.  It was that good.  I am a fan and I will be back.",

Instead of going to one of the bigger or chain restaurants on Sunset we decided to swing by Penn's since I haven't stopped by in awhile.  They're as good as ever but I've never had it to go.    Don't expect a Komol, Lotus of Siam, or Archi's type of restaurant setting, it's smaller like a diner.  But if you want really good Thai food then you can expect it here.    The Spring Rolls comes in 5 pieces with sweet sauce.  The Satay Chicken is also good.  The Beef Fried Rice is excellent and I got a level 10 spice Chicken Panang Curry (it was dummied down level 10 but I understand coming from people who complain about real level 3 spice).    What I don't like about carry out orders is that the curry portion seems smaller than when served inside.",

The beef broccoli was a bland brown piece of rubber...and to make mattes worse, when I called to complain I was told I must come in the same night to get a credit...it could not be offered over the phone.  So, if you want a decent Thai meal, do not go to this restaurant.",

The kids love the big fish tank.  They always get the same thing, orange chicken, sauce on the side!  The waitress knows our orders when we go.  Their curries are amazing.  They're not afraid to make it HOT, so order carefully!  We've been eating here for several years, and it's always delicious.  Fast take out, awesome service, and truly amazing Thai.  I'd put Penn's up against Le Thai downtown. Penn's is definitely better!  Right near paint and wine and the Las Vegas Distillery, so it's perfect for date nights too!  Try it, you'll love it!",

Bring wine, bring receipt, she is coolest in town.   We had pad thai, one of the best ever!    We also did the red curry.  WOW!  both dishes were perfectly spiced, hot, sweet, savory, balanced.   This lady knows how to do it!   I give em 5 stars and 1 star prices.  Best Thai Value in Town!   Be prepared to drive if in Vegas, but if in Henderson, dont miss it, its off Sunset and 95, by Sunset Station kinda, east of freeway.   In strip mall, but the best dang rundown strip mall food I have ever had.....Highly recommended!  Go NOW!",

I went for lunch today and chose the chicken mint chili special with white rice, egg drop soup, and an egg roll (for $6.95). The chicken chili was spiced perfectly, and the egg drop soup was a pleasant surprise.  The only draw backs were the portion size, and egg rolls. My 3 year old son could have finished the food I ordered, and the egg roll tasted like mushy baby food. I would consider this place a \"hole-in-the -wall\" that offers authentic Thai food at reasonable prices.   4.5 stars from me-- battling NAGA for # 2 in my book.",

The depth of flavors makes it unlike any other yellow curry I've ever tried. A little sweet, but not too sweet, as spicy as you want, or not spicy, and it will ruin you for any other thai spots yellow curry. Honestly I can't get myself to try anything else for my entree because this yellow curry is on my top 5 favorite things to eat, ever. Ok I'm being dramatic but it will not disappoint. I've brought friends and they've tried the pad see ew or something like that and they said noodles were really fresh and the flavors were yum!  Also the green tea buns were soo good. Sounds weird but they are $1 each so just try and you will be happy you did. I can't forget to mention they have the best mango sticky rice (when the mango is in season) around here. We went on a mission to find the best in henderson and Penn's won! That's why we started coming here and so happy we did!",

Ordered the pad thai, thai papaya salad, and yellow curry.  They came out excellent and authentic with the spice level perfect. Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "I really expected to love this place, especially after the review Matt S. gave it. I brought my two daughters who love thai food. We arrived to an empty restaurant around 6:30 last night. We had a seat and browsed the menu. I was bummed they only had wine and beer and not a good selection so I ordered water. It tasted like it came from the sink...yuck! The prices were the same as Pin Kaow which is ten times more attractive inside and with really professional, well dressed servers. I always order chicken larb to test out any new place. The server did not ask me a spice level but since I was sharing everything with my two young daughters I figured it must not be spicy. We ordered Pad See Ew and Red beef curry. I asked her how they rate their spiciness and she said, mild, medium and hot. I said mild since it is for the kids. The larb arrives and it had a nice presentation. I too a bite and wow it was hot. I could handle it but the kids could not. I would say it was a 7 on Pin Kaows scale. I asked the server if we could please order some egg rolls since the kids were unable to eat the larb. Next came the noodle dish. The kids loved it and barely let me have a bite. The bite I did have was pretty good. The server came by and said that Penn made chicken curry by mistake and did we want that. I said no we want the beef that we ordered. She seemed irritated. Long after we had finished all the food on the table she brought out the beef curry. It was mostly bamboo shoots, not as much beef as I would have liked. I dished some up with rice and took a bite. I have not had a curry this spicy in my entire life and my husband normally orders a level 8. My nose and eyes began to water. The girls tried one bite and had to spit it out. I flagged down our waitress and told her I think there was a mistake on the heat level. She gave me a huge attitude and stormed off. I heard her speaking the the chef. She came back and said \"Penn says you have to pay since you tasted it.\" I was taken back by how rude she was. I asked her to try the curry because there was no way this would be considered mild, and she began to argue with me and she was waving her hands all around. I said fine I will pay for it and please bring me the check. My kids were very uncomfortable with the way we were treated and could not believe the unprofessional behavior she showed. I feel like I did not go to the same restuarant that all of these people have raved about.",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant for lunch to celebrate a birthday with our Thai friend because the reviews we had read were quite positive.  We have to agree.  There were plenty of menu selections.  The papaya salad was decent, but the favorite dish was the yellow curry; it was a delightful taste. Our server said they make their own curry in house.  We recommend it.  Pad Thai was also very good, not dry like some Thai places we've tried.  Chili Mint was a new entree for most of us, but we will definitely try it again in the dinner portion in the future.  For desert we tried green tea buns and we shared a nice scoop of coconut ice cream garnished with whole peanuts. Our Thai friend said their food is prepared in authentic Thai taste.  We will return in the near future.  The only comment we would make about the premises is that signage is not obvious and it is in an area surrounded by small industrial businesses so you wouldn't be drawn to its location as an eating establishment.  The interior is nothing special (simple) but do not let that deter you from going in.  The food will win you over.  We are already planning who we will take there next.",

Service- Server was very nice ( the only reason they got the second star)  Food- I ordered a basic laad nar (rice noodles in thick gravy w/ brocolis and choice of meet), the meat was tough and it had no flavor.    Price- I think it's overpriced, given you can get better quality Thai food elsewhere for the same price. ($11 for my one entree)",

    "text": "The food here is EXCELLENT.  Within just over a week of discovering Penn's, I was there twice for eat-in lunch and got takeout while finishing up on the 2nd visit!  This is some of the best thai food I have ever had...and I've been to Bangkok!  First visit, I had the yellow curry with chicken which was amazing.  I also had a noodle dish (cant recall the exact name) with chicken, flat noodles, basil, chili and mint.  Also incredible.  I had the vietnamese-like rice paper roll as an appy which was the only thing that didn't blow my socks off.  The 2nd visit I had the Tom Ka soup (includes coconut milk) with  chicken. I have had this soup many, many times elsewhere.  I can say without doubt this was the BEST version I have ever had.  I ordered the large size which came in a big bowl with the usual sterno underneath.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it now.  I also had the chicken panang curry which has always been my favorite.  This didn't disappoint and it was incredible.  The 2nd dish was the pad thai with chicken.  Words can't do it justice...you just have to order it and experience it.  For takeout, I got the red curry and pad thai with beef.  The food sat overnight in the fridge and the flavors intensified and so did the spice level.  The pad thai was even more amazing this way but the red curry might have suffered.  It was very good but not my favorite curry.  I still need to try the green and Mussaman curries!  I had a thai iced tea which was excellent and the thai mango ice cream for dessert.  For the uninitated (like me), this is not your typical cold treat:  you get a plate of hot steaming rice with a sugary syrup and coconut milk on it with room temp mango pieces on the side.  This was an interesting dessert but I probably wont order it again.  My advice is let it sit and cool before you eat it.   As mentioned, the restaurant is located in an old, beat-up strip mall just east of the 95 overpass on Sunset.  The interior is fairly spartan but very clean.  But with food this good, who cares?  The service was great...very attentive and always with a smile.",

No other patrons the whole time we were there, on a Monday night.  Service- Very attentive.  Food-  Summer roll appetizer was just too \"green\" with cilantro/parsley I believe.  I've had better.  The plum sauce was thick and sweet and left a lot to be desired.  Masaman vegetables- far too watery.  I would call it soup-like, but it was thinner than soup.  Panang beef- the thickest, most flavorful panang I have ever had.  Very spicy, an exotic explosion in your mouth...in a good way.  However, the beef itself was chewy and low quality-- that $1.99/lb stuff. Darn, so close to a great dish!  Pad thai-  Excellent. Nice dark color, a certain tanginess/saltiness from fish sauce and lime that went well with the fresh sprouts and carrots served on the side.  Conclusion- Some good, some bad, not fancy, but inexpensive.  I would come back to try the 6.99 lunch specials.",
