    "text": "After reading the reviews for this place, I was a bit apprehensive, but we were short on time as we were departing Planet Hollywood and Blondies was staring right at us. I suppose it was simply good timing for us because the place was virtually empty and we received prompt, friendly service.   We started with the Garlic Bread Balls which were incredibly. Nice crunchy exterior, strong garlic flavor (which I enjoyed) and a soft interior. We polished them off in roughly five minutes.   We decided on a large Pepperoni Pizza and we had to have them take it back initially because we forgot to ask for it well-done. Usually, I get a sense of frustration from the server and / or chef when I have to send food back but the waitress was kind about it and understood and the chef (who brought us our pizza the first time) brought it back out with a smile.   The pizza tasted great. Perfect amount of sauce and the cheese used had a perfect sense of saltiness and it stuck to the pizza perfectly. The pepperoni tasted fresh and it was simply put, a good pizza.   The staff was polite, prompt and our waitress kept our drinks filled. The only thing that keeps this from being a five-star review is that it's a little pricey for what you get, but I was happy to spend a little extra for an experience like this. It appears my trip to Blondies was a bit more pleasurable than some of the previous visitors who have given their reviews.",

I'm not sure if the management had changed since last year, or if we were just lucky, but everything was great!  Our server, Gabby, was so sweet and attentive.  We weren't through with our drinks (soda) and she was at our table with refills.  Always smiling, too!  We ordered various appetizers-potato skins, onion rings, wings and nachos.  Everything came out in a timely fashion and was piping hot and delicious!  Gabby came back to our table to check on us many times while we were enjoying the food.  No complaints from us, in fact, we went back a second time during our stay, and Gabby was our server again....Yay!  She was just as great as the first time.  Thank you for a very nice experience!    In my world...good service equals good tips!",

I would recommend this to anyone!! Our drinks were super strong and we left a great experience overall. Drinks and hot wings...you can't go wrong!",

    "text": "Do you enjoy being served excuses instead of food and drink? How about iced tea that looks like it was made with powdered milk? Are you a fan of waiting 45 minutes for a round of drinks in barely crowded sports bars?   If you answered yes to any of the above, you should go to Blondies and get the hell away from me.   Our party of seven had an hour plus to kill before flying the F out of Sin City and (poorly) decided on Blondies for some much needed snacks and okay, fine, a drink/pitcher. Stop judging.   We sat down and after 15 minutes or so, not one server had come by. How do you miss a group of 7 when your restaurant is the exact opposite of busy? Were we wearing One Rings? I walked up to the group (yes, GROUP) of servers and one of them explained, \"Sorry, we're slammed.\" Girl, do you need a dictionary? Slammed is not the word you need - there are maybe 25 people in this piece.   I'm going to cut this short because I'm getting all insanity wolf thinking about this place, but avoid Blondies at all costs unless you feel like you need to punish yourself for your poor life decisions during your trip. It's the kind of place where you wouldn't be that surprised if you bit into a deep fried rat. And if you look at all the other reviews that are over one star, assume it's because these people were blackout drunk because there is no way in actual hell this place is \"CRACKIN'\" or \"pretty fun.\" It is \"fucking terrible\" and \"should not exist.\"",

Not sure if I would pay 12$ for them regularly but with the Groupon it was a good deal!   I had a build your own burger with bleu cheese and bacon. YUM. HUGE. altho no fries, you have to pay 3$ to add fries to a meal. It was okay for use though because we had a LOT of food. My husband ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich, and he thought it was decent. He thought he probably would try something else next time.  Service was great, altho we were there at a low low time, as they weren't very busy. Lotsa TV's lotsa cute girls....  I'm unsure about my overall feeling.

I'm sure that was due to the high cover charge for the game though.  The bar food was just that, bar food. The problem is that it wasn't very good. the wings were sub par - very bland and rather small, cheese sticks were nasty, and the meatballs were a gelatinous mass. Yuck!!!  The service was OK, but nothing special. You would have thought that at an event like that they could keep up, but they couldn't. Our waitress only had a couple of other tables and no one was drinking heavily, and folks were still running out.   This place definitely had a dive feeling to me, but without the charm a good dive should have.",

    "text": "I was hoping for a good (drunk) time but nothing. I like many others got the Groupon deal of an open bar for $10 from the regularly priced $20. Even if you don't have a Groupon, Blondies advertises the best happy your in Vegas: All you can drink (beer or well drinks) from 3-6pm or 10pm-1am, excluding game days. Blondies is located inside the always busy Miracle Mile in Planet Hollywood. It's a great place to catch a game compared to other pricier places on the Vegas strip.  Me and my lady friend went in on Friday, January 17 and we're expecting a wait but it was pretty dead for 10pm on a Friday night. Blondies has some serious square footage and there's a plethora of sports memorabilia and flat-screens littered throughout the bar and grill. We were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted and we headed towards the back bar. However, we quickly made our way back to the front bar after the bar tender informed us she was closing up.  After seating ourselves, a server was quick to tend to us and we let him know we had the open bar deal. He went on to put a bracelet on us and began serving us well drinks. Simple vodka and juice drinks. The first drink was nothing to brag about. I felt like I was drinking expired cranberry juice while my girlfriend drank orange juice. I knew then and there we were not going to get drunk. Five drinks (each) later we were exploding from a big dinner and tons of cranberry and orange juice. Not even a buzz. We decided to call it quits and take our loss.   I think my biggest gripe is the inconsistency in drinks. The bartenders were great guys but one was making us real drinks while the other was serving us juice. Regardless I was nice enough to tip every time. The TV at our bar was playing an old UFC fight and my lady was forced to watch some guy get his head and nose bashed in while we drank our watered down drinks. We could have asked to change the channel, but didn't feel like bothering our bartenders. I'm sure this isn't a bad place by any means but I'll have to dispute their claim as the best happy hour in Vegas.   Ambiance/Decor: 3/5 Food (Drinks): 1/5 Service: 3/5 Price: $$ Overall: 2/5  Pros: + Full bar + Open 24 hours + Drink specials + Lunch/dinner menu + Cute hostess' and bartenders  Cons: - Open bar drinks vary in strength",

I tend to drink a lot of water and can easily go through 2 or 3 of those bottles of water in a meal so rationing out my one bottle of water to last through the meal was not the easiest task.  Especially since I was already a little dehydrated and tend to rely on restaurant tap water for hydration when I'm in vegas anyway...  2) The food is kinda bland.  You must pay extra for a lot of condiments/extras that typically come with your meal.  However, I do tend to like food a little on the plain side so I really enjoyed my sandwich.  The turkey in it was really fresh, as was the lettuce and tomato in it.  Not having any mustard/mayo/etc. added to it was a little odd to me though.  It felt like something was missing the entire time I was eating.  3) Loved the steak fries here..  4) a little overpriced, but that is to be expected in this type of vegas dining.",

We got the groupon that included a pitcher of beer with burgers and an appy for two for $25 - and it was really good. There is a patio so you can people watch in the miracle mile mall area.. and we all know how fun that is!!",

    "text": "I'm glad I read Jeannie L's review because it put me in perspective. I've always written reviews based on \"what it is\". I was ready to give this place a \"1\" due to the fact that this place is rated as \"One of the Top 5 Sports Bars on the Strip\" and it shouldn't be. Based on that, I'd give it a \"1\". Based on what you should expect from a Sports Bar, it ends up being a \"3\". Average food, a $20 all you can drink Happy Hour (3 PM - 6 PM) for well drinks and house beers, enough TV's, indifferent service (it feels like they are doing you a favor serving you). You can find hotties anywhere in Las Vegas so what makes their servers different? Found their prices to be higher than your average Las Vegas Bar. I won't be back.",

The waitress says, \"If you want onions or mushrooms, it's an extra .35 each\"  WTF!!!!! A Philly cheesesteak sandwich is supposed to come with onions and mushrooms!   We ordered a large pizza, okay? Not some greesy dough covered in slimy, greasy cheese.  HORRIBLE!  Then here's the kicker.  The waitress comes out with four glasses and four BOTTLED WATERS!  \"Hold up,\" I say, \"I didn't order bottled water...regular water is fine.\"  She says, \"Water is a dollar a bottle...it all goes to charity.\"  WTF????  \"Well, you really should have told us that when we asked for water,\" I replied.  The waitress just looked at me and said, \"Do you want the waters or not?!\"   Oh HELL to the F*** no, you didn't, Bimbo.  The next time she came out to our table and asked if there was anything else she could get for us, I just said, \"Just more napkins...UNLESS...you charge for those too!\" Absolutely, hands down, the WORST restaurant in the Miracle Mile!",

If you enjoy being treated like the dirt at the bottom of your shoe, this is the place for you.  However, if you like to receive great customer service and a delightful meal for a reasonable price this is NOT the place for you.  I went to \"BLONDIES\" after a late night wedding in Vegas and it was to die for or from in the literal.   1) It took forever to get service and food (people that were seated after us were eating before us) 2) One of the individuals in my groups order was not correct 3) The one thing I order a baked potato was cold and old 3) The manager could careless and he let us know it from the response he gave my friend.    When it was all said and done, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt! So, I took matters into my own hands and said to myself maybe a different approached and a different manager would bring so much need light to the situation.  Nope, I will say at least the other manager attempted to listen, until the rude and disrespectful manger decided to interject with his ignorance (adding fuel to the fire).  As a result, of being completely disrespected and devalued as a customer, I decide to attempt to contact the owner (no success, however not surprised), and finally I decided to write something to caution other travelers not to waste your money at a place like this, when there are other great and fabulous venues in Vegas worth the money.  I refuse to spend my hard earned money at place that could careless how customers are treated.  The staff is a reflection of the management and the management is a reflection of the ownership.  There end is the problem no accountability and employees are allowed to treat customers less than civilized.  They are one of the only establishments open late on Miracle Mile and thus they could careless, plus they aren't about building customer loyalty.   Good Luck if you dare to Dine there!",

We were seated quick enough and the atmosphere was nice. TV's everywhere, games, good drink specials. All of that was killed by the absolute horrible service. Our waitress took our orders and then came around twice before handing us our checks (our total bill came out to close to $100).   My beer sat empty , as well as two other drinks, for about 10 minutes before she noticed. The hardly ever smiled and didn't seem friendly at all. Then after she gave our checks and put our card she completely spaced out and came back with two copies because she split outlet our one order in two. Seriously? Anyways, it was disastrous by that alone. Food was mediocre to good. I suppose it could've been an isolated incident but since it did happen to me then it gets one star. Excel always.",

We got in and got a table right away. The tables are pretty cool because they have taps right in the middle and you can poor your own beer and pay by how much you drink. That would have been awesome for our rather large group except the selection is limited on what beers you can choose and our waitress kept encouraging us to get buckets of beer because she didn't want to deal with the hassle of turning on the taps. We ended up getting buckets of beer because she kept pushing us to even though we really wanted draft beers. It became evident later that she was just lazy and didn't want to come back and serve us. I think she checked on us one time in the several hours we were there. We had to go to the bar to order more beers because she decided to sit in a booth in the back and fold silverware. I know the forks won't roll up in the napkins themselves but come on check on your tables. We had to hand deliver our credit cards to her because the bar couldn't check us out. Overpriced beers even for Vegas and the service is terrible. Go elsewhere.",

I love Cobb salads so I wanted to try it.  What was famous about their salad? I couldn't figure it out.  Just about every other Cobb salad I've eaten, the toppings are diced.  Not this one they served.  It looked like a disaster.  The tomatoes were sliced.  The bacon wasn't in diced pieces.  It just wasn't good and wouldn't order again.

    "text": "Bottom line up front: The food was good but the service was horrible! There are so many good restaurants and bars around that I strongly encourage you to go somewhere else.  Cynthia, our waitress took our order and somebody else brought our food. She didn't stop by our table again until we were finished eating and ready to pay. I was so anxious to leave because of the drunks yelling at each other while playing beer pong that I didn't realize that Cynthia didn't bring my debit card back when she had me sign the receipt.   When I realized it later, I called and was put on hold forever. Nobody ever came back on the line so I finally hung up and called back. They confirmed that they had my card and that I could pick it up at the bar. After a long walk back to get my card, the bartender looked at me a couple times but ignored me, even though I was the only one there. Two young ladies came and sat down and he walked past me to take their orders. I appreciate their pointing to me and \"forcing\" him to acknowledge my presence. He gave my card back and immediately turned back to them with no apology for putting me out or making me walk quite a ways out of my path late at night.  To give them credit, the food was good. No complaints there, but that's the only thing they have going for them. The screaming drunks don't add pleasantly to the ambiance and if you want anything, it appears that you have to be rude about it. The attitude of the staff is astoundingly bad and this is the last time I will ever eat at a Blondies. It was so bad that I'm not interested in giving another location a chance.   Good food, LOUSY service. Pick another place to eat and drink and thank me later.",

    "text": "Don't waste your time trying to watch a fight there. They stuffed everyone in the bar like sardines for the Canelo/Chavez Jr fight. It must have been a huge fire hazard. You can't move around anywhere in that place. You can pay for a table but get zero privacy. They make sure to fill up every free space in that bar. Someone hit our table and knocked beer all over us. The person didn't mean to hit our table but there was literally no room for anyone to move. The owner is an absolute prick. I actually don't know who was worse, the owner or the doorman.   They both had zero customer service skills. I saw them both cursing at a paying customer. I couldn't see but it also looked like the doorman got into a fight with another customer. All I saw was the doorman leaving with his shirt almost off and video cameras rolling. The owner is disorganized and a lair. He said he didn't know he was getting the fight until two days before the fight yet all of the reservations on his website were sold out Wednesday. If you called ahead of the fight they said standing room only cover was 40 dollars. On the day of the fight they changed the cover to 60 dollars and basically gave you the middle finger if you asked why the cover was changed. I get you can do whatever you want it's your business but at least show some respect to your customers.   The standing room only place is a night mare. The room they put you in has no air conditioning and they throw in a couple chairs; way to close to these giant projectors. It's worse than watching a movie in the front row of a theater. I felt bad for the waiters trying to get around the place. I will actually say the only good thing about our experience was our waiter. She was working extremely hard to make sure we had everything we needed. We tipped her more than the cost of our bill because we figured she would get stiffed and it wasn't her fault. I believe her name was kymberly. She was the saving grace of that place.   With that being said, I will still never be back to this place just because of the owner. The all you can drink isn't worth it. You basically get bud light or call Drinks in a tiny cup. You get what you pay for. If you're trying to watch a boxing match I would recommend trying diablos or just paying the fee to get into the MGM closed circuit viewing parties. Yes blondies might be cheaper than most places for boxing but you get what you pay for. For a few dollars more you can go to a bigger place and actually have room to breathe. I believe UFC is different and a lot of other places on the strip show the fights. You're almost SOL for boxing but you can pretty much watch a UFC anywhere.   Go look at a couple bad reviews written and you can see the owners is sure to fire back. Perfect example of how horrible the customer services is there.  Owners reply below covers it all. No idea what he is talking about. He must be mad because I called him out on a policy he wrote online. He told me he made the website himself and what i was talking about wasn't on the site. When I opened the site and showed him his policy he wasn't too happy. Not even sure what lagasse's is but I would rather go there. Thanks for giving me another option. Believe me I would rather pay the extra money else where to be comfortable. If you pay more money to sit outside and you don't get any sound for a fight I guess the people outside are getting screwed. Most unprofessional business run. His 2 1/2 stars is way too high. Don't chance this place for a fight. You'll have a way better experience paying money some where else.",

Onion rings, I ate one (saturated in oil, the onion was mushy), and the waitress didn't offer to comp it or anything. Curly fries, no seasoning.   Our waitress came 3 times.

Upon arriving found out that all you can drink special didn't start until after preliminary fights were over 2 hours later.  2) Packed: Are there fire laws in Vegas? They packed so many people into that small space. Everyone was standing shoulder to shoulder.  3) All you can drink = 2 beers: There were so many people that once the \"all you can drink\" special started it was almost impossible to get a beer. There was no way to get to the bar and the waitresses serving beer were mobbed by the people around the bar so people in the back could not get a drink. By the end of the night we were only able to get 2 beers each out of the \"all you can drink\" special.   4) No security: As the evening progressed a group of fans became more and more rowdy. There was no security presence. At the end of the fight they began jumping on chairs, shoving and falling on other guests. Nothing was done to stop them or protect the other guests.   This place may be nice at other times, but I do not recommend coming here to see an event.",

When she did show up she didn't seem to care things were wrong.   My sister had to go to the bar to get water that she'd asked for twice already.  When we asked about a discount for the wrong meals a whopping $4.50 was deducted REALLY???  When the bill came they tack on a 4% fee for using a credit card.  Unbelievable to say the least.

It is pretty fun to watch and attracts all sorts of weirdos (great people watching!)   Typically I find shots of Patron to be very expensive. I was tickled to find $5 shots to be a permanent fixture on their menu. I had several of those smooth evening starters.   Beer is Las Vegas is an absolute joke. No matter where you go it seems you find the generic Bud Lite, Heineken, Corona, etc etc etc crap. It is rare you find  quality craft beer. At Blondies I was able to get Dog Fish Head 60 Minute IPA in 32 ounce mugs for $11.....   I returned two days in a row. The Patron and Beer lured me back.

Sat in the back room with the two large screens. No was around to take an order. Waited about 5-10 minutes got up to go to the other side.  Looked around saw waitresses folding napkins with silverware on the corner table across from the bar in the back.  Asked the waitresses if we could get someone to take an order and all were courteous when asking. Approach the bar in the back, asked for two drinks, was informed i can only order one at a time.  After getting a drink, returned to the table and still waiting for someone.  It was approximate  another 5-7 minutes before someone came.  Waitress was courteous, polite and attentive during the course of ordering, delivering and refilling drinks.  At one point later in the night she informed that there was over 200 customers in the other room. Which was appreciative and helped understand if waiting a little longer.  When paying the bill, asked for a refills thats when being informed the all you can drink stops after the fight.   Food- was ok; not the greatest.  Please have someone station in the other room if you are promoting an event.  Business seemed to have enough staff to cover all areas.  Because the lack of this and the missing of the fine details of all you can drink as a local and customer, find hard to rate the buisness any better.    Great disappointment",

I will defiantly be coming back and sending friends. If you decide to go in and have a drink make sure you ask for Ashley! You won't be disappointed!",

You can tell she really wanted to make sure you had everything you needed and I didn't feel that I ever had to \"wave her down\" when we needed something. She really took care of us. A lot of people just leave you waiting forever but she was on her game. She made our night even better and will definitely be coming back soon!!!",

After we met her we ended up coming back for a 3rd time just a few hours later to sit in her section, watch a game, have some drinks an good conversation, she made our trip a good one and we will be back!

We were told, (parented) that we are to see the hostess if we make a table change on our own.  Now, neither of the two servers were not waiting on us.   Placed an order for garlic bread and wings. The food was delivered to our table and the wings did not come with the carrots and celery as described on the menu.  We asked the food runner who brought our food out where the celery and carrots were. He said that they weren't offering that anymore. I said I saw it on the menu and to please check. He never came back to us. I asked our server about this and she said that they were waiting on \"new menus\" that didn't offer the \"extras\" with the wings. She said that she could get us some celery out from behind the bar. We passed.   What, management could use a marker or tape to cover this up on the menu?   No apology, no manager in site. Would not go back or recommend this establishment as a stop on your Las Vegas vacation.",

My grandson had a pepperoni pizza and he gave it a 7 1/2 out of ten, Ok but nothing great. My wife had a Cobb salad and thought it was good. I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak and side if onion rings. The onion rings were good, but not great. Now, we get to my cheesesteak sandwich. When it came it was a French roll with a couple pieces of cheese and some chopped up meat. The meat was like chopped carne Assad without the spice. I just looked at it and asked the server; \"doesn't a cheesesteak have grilled onions and grilled peppers?\" The server responded that those are extra, do you want some?\" Seriously? Philly's should have the meat, cheese, onions and peppers all grilled together. I don't know what this sandwich was but it wasn't a Philly Cheesesteak. Basically, we won't ever return but if you just want to grab some food it is OK.",

The first meal they charged us 2.00 for each vegetable added to the pizza when the menu said 50 cents. They did correct it but blamed the computer. This morning they charged me an extra 1.00 on an egg I had added. Again they tried to pass the buck by the floor manager. I just want people to watch as this must happen all the time.  After this response from the manager I had to respond:  Comment from Von M. of Blondies Sports Bar & Grill  Business Customer Service 12/10/2016  Menu never said .50cent per topping and the toppings for the big 16inch pizza are always 2.00$ also an extra side is $1 that is correct ... eggs arnt free sorry . Takecare   Von M  Wow! I'm appalled at your response. I don't appreciate you insinuating we lied on our review. As we went to the hostess stand each time and reread the menu to check pricing. For your information we ordered a SMALL pepperoni pizza and added 3 vegetable toppings as the menu said each was 50 cents per topping. The Pizza was not a 16\" like you referred to. When we got the bill we were charged $2.00 per topping. We checked the menu again and it stated 50 cents per topping. The waitress also checked and told us we were correct.  The next morning we had breakfast and ordered one egg with our meal (I know they are not free) and again was charged $1.00 more than what was stated on the menu. Again my husband went to the hostess stand and checked the menu and sure enough we were charged an extra $1.00 more than what was stated on the menu. We had the same waitress in both situations which it appeared she was somewhat embarrassed knowing that this was second time around for us.  I suggest that you get your menu to correlate with your computer and maybe that would solve a lot of your problems. Judging by the other yelp reviews you have commented on, you have done a good job showing your rudeness. My suggestion to you is that if you can't take the heat of \"yelp reviews\" you need to get out of the kitchen. In other words get another job.  It might save you the trouble showing how you react to dissatisfied customers.",

We ended up having 4 of the Golden Road Brown Ales (god stuff) - though in retrospect $60 seems a little steep. I'd remembered being at Blondies before and thinking the beer prices were a bargain - must have been on a happy hour. An order of a dozen wings was $18 and were nothing special in size, texture or flavor. The 3 sliders were $13 and while small, were pretty tasty. It's tough finding any place on the strip that's a bargain anymore - here we paid $119 w/ tip for 4 beers, a dozen wings and one order of sliders. From the Sports Bar persepective, there were 9 TVs visibile where we sat, but 5 had the same game on. We asked about changing the channel, but the waitress must have spaced it off. We probably would have been happier hitting the Buffalo Wild Wings we bypassed a block earlier to get to Blondies.",

I wasn't expecting much, just a beer and a place to watch the game, but the service was so deplorable here that I waited almost 10 minutes to even pay my bill at the bar for 1 beer, the bartender was too busy talking to a coworker. I'm nice and efficient as a patron and I appreciate when I get the same service. Unfortunately this place provides none of that. You're better off going somewhere else.",

Food was good but better than the food was the customer service I got. I was here by myself because my travel person still asleep. Robyn the bartender gave me the best customer service experience I got from any server in my whole entire stay at Vegas. Lots of conversation but never too much. She knew when to ask questions and coversate and when I wanted to be left alone with my food. She never bothered me, she never rushed, and just a great ear when I wanted to talk. You only have bartenders/servers like her once in a while so today had to show my appreciate.",

The bake potato was decent.   Service?   The waitress got our order wrong at first, them blamed it on me because it would come out of her paycheck.

If you're into drinking a whole bunch of crap beer, they do have unlimited drink wristband specials a couple of times a day. And they do often have $5 shots. So on the upside, while still overpriced, it's not as overpriced as some other places. But this is definitely not the kind of place you seek out. You just pop in for a beer when you're right near it.",

Decided this year to watch both the AFC and NFC championship games which required a deposit and prior online reservations to reserve a specific table (deposit was good towards your check).  I was kind of expecting it to be utter chaos just because of how packed they get for football and was just expecting to be a tad disappointed . I was very pleasantly surprised that it was just the opposite.   We arrived and were taken to our table that had our name on it and showed that it was reserved for us for both games. We were almost immediately greeted by our servers Amber and Danny (we had two servers because we were there for 7 hours) who were so delightful and extremely attentive the entire time. Despite being packed to the rim with people watching the games Amber was checking on us constantly. Got a few snacks during the game which were tasty (remember people this is not a 5-star restaurant) and even a few \"on the house\" shots.   I highly recommend going to Blondies to watch any game. They have dozens of TVs so there is never an obstructed view from any table. Their prices on alcohol are extremely reasonable considering it's Las Vegas and the staff is so friendly and accommodating. Blondies definitely made both games soooooo entertaining!!!",

The waitress was cranky and showed no interest in serving us. She expected us to order the moment we sat down and then once we ordered she was never seen again!  We had to pay at the bar because she literally vanished! We spent most of our meal with angry guests on front of us complaining about how the restaurant overcharged their cards, and the waitress pretended she didn't know how to fix it. The food was greasy and not worth the price paid. And to add insult to injury both people in my party had an allergic reaction to the food!  There are too many other options to settle for bad food and crappy service! I really wish I knew how to contact the owners because we spoke to the manager and he did nothing! Never again!",

It was pretty empty for a Sunday night, probably because it is nestled deep in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood that are mostly closed that late. We ordered Mozzarella sticks and each got a wrap and a drink. The Mozz sticks were good, and the wraps were fine, but both were pretty expensive. The bill was almost $70 which I felt was a bit excessive for the amount of food we got. The wraps did not even come with fries. I'm sure this place is more fun with more people, when it's more of a bar than a late night restaurant. This is just my experience.  The waitresses wear Cheerleader uniforms, and were pretty attentive, though the bartender was slow with our drinks.",

Got there and there was a bit of a line that moved quickly. The bouncer told us it would be $60 a person cover but \"all you can drink\" once you're inside. Two of my friends immediately left because they didn't want to pay that much for cover. My other friend and I wanted to check other places first (Twin peaks & Cabo Wabo). Other places were at least $75 with nothing included so Blondies seemed like a better deal.   We came back, paid the $60 and were shocked when we got inside. (you can't see the inside of the bar on fight night as there as black curtains draped everywhere). It was PACKED. When I say packed I mean they should have a maximum capacity limit which they clearly ignored. Every table was taken, and they had chairs set up in every other open floor area which were also all taken. People were literally eating pizza off of the floor due to lack of seating and tables.   They also didn't tell us that \"all you can drink\" meant ONLY bud light. My friend doesn't even drink beer (gluten intolerance) so it was a total rip off for her. Bud light is not my drink of choice, I would have rather had a cheap well vodka with soda. This was so deceiving and should have been told to us at the door upon taking our money.   It was just pure chaos. We paid $60 to stand and be pushed by rushed waitresses telling us \"excuse me\" and \"please move\" for FOUR HOURS!!!   I would NEVER come back here. Staff is dishonest and only wants your money. I've never been more uncomfortable in a bar in my life. Never again. STAY AWAY!",

We went with a couple of our friends. The drinks we had you can tell it was the cheapest liquor they could use in the well drinks and the mixes they use are very sweet for pre made drinks they use. The place is usually loud it is hard to hear anyone talking unless you are right next to who you are talking to. You can tell the bartender is not too happy when doing the wrist bands, so he acts really busy so when you do need another one it takes a bit for him to come and make it. We would not just stop here to have a drink, and if it wasn't for having friends in town who was staying at PH we probably would have not gone here.  We did eat here once for dinner just me and my husband. Prices for dinner are higher than some places, I guess cause it is in the miracle mile shop area. We thought the food was ok, Service was not the best, they were busy when the waitress would leave it was a bit before she came back. Over all this is not a locals place it is touristy for sure! I would definitely read the reviews before coming here.",

From pizza to steak and  potatoes...I haven't come across an item that I've had to second guess or doctor up.  All-in-all, check this place out if you get the chance.  You won't regret it.",

We ended up spending about 2-3 hours at the bar while we waited to go to the airport to catch our flight home. The Sweet Habanero wings and Parmesan Truffle fries were a hit! I also highly recommend the Fuzzy Mule (their spin on a Moscow Mule) it was delicious. Huge shout out to Daniela on the bar staff and Keith the manager who sat and chatted with my husband and I for a while and made us feel so at home.   From Philly to Vegas...we'll def be back!!!",

Came here on a Wednesday morning for lunch, got the turkey avocado wrap, I was only able to take 2 bites out of it cause it tasted disgusting, the turkey ham was warm, while the rest of the stuff in the wrap was cold, my husband ordered a blt and he couldn't eat it either, it had a bunch of bacon that felt stale and seemed as if it had been reheated from an old batch. The only good thing we got were bloody Mary's. We had initially tried to cancel the food order when we noticed they were short staffed, but our server said that she had put the order in already , we didn't complain about our food since we don't like to make a big deal out of things, but yea. Please don't come here, unless you like shitty food. I only gave 2 stars because our server was at least nice, not her fault this place is short staffed, and not her fault for the shitty food.",

Evidently you had to have a wristband for $20 price which wasn't offered to us and as we were leaving I asked the hostess stand of they had wristbands and they said no.

This is my first and last time coming here and I drove 30 minutes for this BS this is a disgrace they won't get my money ever again! If you like to be disappointed go here they won't let you down trust me! The best part about this  place was our server brook she was very friendly and nice and she was the only reason I even stayed to watch the game! And to make things worst I get my food and it's disgusting this is just embarrassing I wonder how this place is even operating !",

It cost $21 for the first game of beer pong, and $14 every game after. They give you a pitcher of your choice beer, plastic cups, and ping ping balls.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun, up beat sports bar, with the ability to play beer pong.",

    "text": "Summary: This is a great place if you want to watch a game/sports and drink loads of cheap beer while eating some (to my surprise) pretty good bar food. Since I don't drink - sadly the cheap / all you can drink beer was a waste on me. I'd bring a crew here for sure.  I went to Blondies to view the UFC fights (Go John Jones!) - cover was a bit overpriced $40! BUT I forgive that for the cheap beer - again, wasted on me - but I can see how paying $40 cover + $20 = damn good night for some folks.   Atmosphere: What you'd expect from a sports bar - loads of TVs, etc. If you have a big group you can \"buy\" a big booth with primo viewing to the screens, if youre a small group or solo - there's plenty of seating available.  The people in this place range wildly - you are in Vegas. I found mostly friendly sports-watching-having-a-good-time people.   Food: HEARTY portions, and surprisingly pretty good. I had a BLT and shared some onion rings, both of which were not greasy and overdone - but tasted fresh. Even the toasted bread on my sandwich was fresh.   Service: Decent. I was happy that the girls in cheerleader uniforms weren't so boob-a-licious that it was annoying. They were cute and friendly, and bless them for having to run around with pitchers of beer serving half distracted sports watchers. They were fast, I didn't wait forever, and there was enough of them that i never had to flag one down.  Overall - better than Buffalo Wild Wings for a little in-hotel Vegas sports action.",

If you have had a few to drink and want some great food come into Blondies and enjoy a good meal. Their are tv's in every corner, so you won't miss a second of the action. There are 4 beer pong tables that you can enjoy and possibly get over your buzz.  The best thing is that the food was fast and the service (waitress) was outstanding.  So cone by here at the end of the night and enjoy some good food. We will be back mainly because of Taylor.",

Service was pretty good thou. ;p  The bench seats were pretty cool but the food is only ok. We ordered their traditional wings. It was deep fried but they over soaked it with the sauce that made the chicken soggy. We ordered their nachos with all the fixings but it cost over $21! Was not worth it as it was flavorless or nothing special about it. We ordered the $3.99 all you can eat pasta. There is a choice of fettuccine Alfredo or spaghetti. It came with garlic bread but it was kinda soggy thou. I think the past was pretty good for the price due to size.  Bathrooms were kinda nasty. They need to really clean it.

Lots of decorations to help the wondering eye, many tv screens-showing all types of sporting events/news, and a killer bar.  We had some cold ones, as we pondered what to do the rest of the day, in Vegas. A staff member came around to snap a \"voluntary\" postcard photo of you. The postcard is cute, but if you love who you're with and the photo is adorbs, you'll likely shell out $20, like we did, for the larger, Vegas-themed backdrop with it. It resembles what you'd find at an amusement park. The staff was nice, but a tad slow behind the bar. Aka busy.",

Our waitress also griped that no one was taking her tables after her shift, in the middle of happy hour, and then she disappeared.

So after doing some research I came across Blondies menu, and I was glad to see that they serve cheesesteaks with Amoroso rolls from Philly.  That was all I needed to know.  I came here late at night long after the Miracle Mile shops were closed, so I felt kinda awkward walking thru an empty mall trying to get to this place.  When I got there the place was pretty dead and the waitresses seemed very tired.  The only real noise was coming from the drunk folks playing beer pong, that was pretty entertaining to watch.  Anyways, I ordered a mushroom cheesesteak whiz witout (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1LCXyXz&s=0cdee69740bb78199479bc39795963f47c2fa21d918576240ece9cd9e168edd1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1LCXyXz</a>), and after I took my first bite, I was in cheesesteak bliss.  Sure it might have been because it was 1:30am and I was having hunger pangs, but I didn't care, I was enjoying it.  So why only 2 stars??  Good cheesesteak, but that's pretty much where it ends.  Place was dead, atmosphere was cold, waitresss weren't very motivated.  I'd only suggest stopping by here if you're really hungry and need a quick lunch or late night snack.",

    "text": "As L and I wandered around the Miracle Mile looking for something good to eat we decided to stop by Blondie's and figure out where we were in relation to the front of the hotel.  We were actually attempting to get to the Hawaiian Tropic restaurant.  The girl in front literally looked at me and was like, \"Um, you're in the Miracle Mile... in the Planet Hollywood.\"  HELLO, DUH!   I said nothing.  So, tired of wandering and having food smells lure us in, we decided to eat at Blondies.  The waitress seemed fine until she started talking.  L was feeling like a beer but the selection sucked- at a sports bar- wtf.  When she asked the waitress if there were cocktails or a wine list she told us that there was ONLY wine and that it was limited to the house red or white.  Too bad there was a full bar inside that I only noticed after ordering!!!!!!!!!!   Strike ONE.  Strike two- she neglected to ask me what kind of cheese I wanted on my chicken sandwich so I got NONE!  I was so disappointed as I am a total cheese freak.  After bringing these matters to her attention she said she would have the manager give us a discount.  Strike three?  The discount was maybe 2% (like a dollar and some change) of the entire bill.  I guess the gesture was nice and all but if it was such a silly amount it was pretty much pointless.  They put powdered sugar on their sweet potato fries which sounds ok in theory but doesn't work when they're a side to a burger.  It's also quite pricey for average food and terrible service.  Yeah... no.",

We came here to watch the Charger game and they weren't even showing it. Still we pressed on and walked up to the Hostess booth. We were flat out ignored for 3 plays before I got annoyed and tried to grab the attention of the Hostess, who had been standing there the whole time with her finger in the air telling us to wait. I was told to \"Hold on.\" And so I did, much to my dismay. When she finally looked up she said nothing, just stared. We asked for a table and asked how long the wait was. Honestly the place was packed and so I expected to wait, but the girl said \"I don't know there's a list.\" We had to ask to be put on it and she said \"What's your number?\" and then turned around and walked off. I wasn't even sure she had actually written it down. We went in to try and grab a beer at the bar, but the bartenders were rude and didn't care. One of the hostesses ran into me and then rolled her eyes and walked away. Mind blown....   We found ourselves wandering into a seedy looking little bar across the way called The Stripper Bar. I thought we were about to go in for round two, but the service was amazing, the food was good, they were playing our game, they had better deals on drinks and our waitress did a pretty good dance on the pole at half time. I don't care if there is a 50 foot stripper right outside of the place. And aside from that, Blondies' TVs are so freaking huge we were able to watch their screens from our seats in the bar, we just turned around. I'll pick this place over Blondies any day.",

We bit, and came in because we also wanted food.  There were a lot of beer pong matches going on as it was a Thursday night and that seems to be the theme.  We ordered some food, and I ordered the \"Build your own Burger\" and it was pretty damn good.  You get your choice of THREE toppings as well as cheese - I opted for Avocado, Blue Cheese and Bacon -  and skipped the extra cheese.  It was interesting though when our bill came because they waitress told us the beer we were drinking was \"not included\"... even though we told her we had the bands, and wanted to \"try\" the best beer AND the host and hostess specifically told us come in for $10 DRAUGHT beers, and the menu said $10 DRAUGHT beers - so maybe there was small print with that but if we have bands, and we are drinking anything BUT what is included, you would think they would question it.  Anyways - They were nice enough to drop those off our bill becuase it was clearly a misunderstanding by all parties.  Because of that, they get an extra star!  The downfall of this place is the noise-  It's filled with screaming college kids playing beer pong on Thursdays, Im sure other days may be a bit more relaxed as it wouldnt have the wristbands, so when I am in town again, I will be stopping in again.",

Place was jam packed. Went to the front of the line to get in an show host our reservations.  Lady took us in to our table.  Could barely walk because so much people shoulder to shoulder.  It must be a fire hazard.  Finally got to our table only to find that our table had NOT been reserved.  There was about 10 people  occupying the space that we had paid money for.  No   reserved sign at all. An there was fresh food that just had been brought out for some scrubs in my space so then I knew that they did not reserve the table.  We decided to leave an take the loss.  Do not go there very dissapointed.  This was supposed to be one of the highlights of our trip because it was my girlfriends birthday.  We did not watch the fight, missed the whole show.   Definitely not recommended!!!!!!!!!!",

I can't believe this place gets away with this, being in a mall with upper class stores!  The paint on the flooring in front of the toilet was all worn away and greyish looking.  There was graffiti on the sanitary recepticle and no bag inside it.  Everything was dirty and worn out looking.  Yuck!  I definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone and would not return.  There are much better places to try in Las Vegas!",

Maybe people are used to getting their drinks for free in the casino, but as far as I'm concerned, the all-you-can-drink happy hour is the way to go.  Great place to watch a game, especially a fight, but get there early for a title bout.  Very good bar food (don't expect anything healthy... you're in Vegas), excellent service.  Love this place.",

She tried to say it charges the house if it's under 25 dollars.

I should reiterate that, every inch of the place is practically covered in flat screens.  That's really the reason you will ever step foot in here.  The perfect spot to watch every single football game being broadcasted.  It's a pretty average sports bar.  Decent beer & food menu.  Maybe it was the booze still talking but an order of loco moco seemed like the best option at 10 am from the breakfast menu.  Honestly, it wasn't half bad and was better than I expected.  Tip - If you've got a group, do make reservations for a table during the football games, as this place will fill up during game time.",

This way there isn't fighting over who's game should be heard. Downfalls... the people don't know what channel the games are on. Tried watching an LA Kings game there and was told repeatedly that it wasn't available. Luckily my brother know the owner and regulated... Well wouldn't ya know? They were able to find the game... what a shocker... the all you can drink happy hour is pretty cool too. Get it with the Groupon and save yourself $10. The bad part is that it's all Bud products or well drinks made with ass-flavored liquor. What do you expect for $10?  Food is meh.  Vibe is cool. Chicks in cheerleader outfits... effing awesome!

We were sitting for 15 min and nobody came to our table. So, I went to the bar to order our drinks and food. I placed our order with the bartender. She said that the waitress will take our order at our table. I asked if I could order the drinks because no one has come to our table. The bartender rolled her eyes and said \"I guess\". I placed our drink order. I asked for 3 margaritas, 2 bud lights & 1 Miller lite. She gave me 3 bud lights. I told her that I asked 1 Miller lite & 2 bud lights. She rolled her eyes at me and  said \"no you didn't\"! I said yes I did,because I don't drink bud light. I drink Miller lite. With her attitude she refused to change 1 of the bud lights for a Miller Lite. I asked to speak the manager. I explained to him what had happened. He said \"no problem\"' and gave me a Miller lite. We also ordered food from the waitress. The wings and burgers were pretty good. We all have bad days. It wasn't necessary to give a customer attitude over a beer.",

I usually have no qualms about paying for food, but when it sucks, it just makes me frustrated.    SO. I'd give this place only 1 star for the food, but I give it an extra star because it's a fun place to watch sports games. Lots of televisions, loud and fun crowd!

It allowed a gang of us to play beer pong in peace, and get drinks and food without an issue.  I will admit getting the waitresses attention was sometimes difficult, even with there being less than 15 people in the entire place. This may have been due to the fact I was not sober.  We did order the big tall beer thingy. From what I recall it was a decent deal split among friends. But who's looking at deals when you're with a gang of cool buds, eating bar food, and playing some beer pong?!  I'd recommend dropping in with a group if its not too crowded, as there is plenty of seating/TV's. I can only imagine it gets packed here during March Madness or regular football season.  Side note: waitresses are indeed dressed to only what Vegas can offer.  Overall I was pleased with the place and will drop by to see if it was the same as it was a year ago. March madness, here we go!",

After taking it back to the kitchen and waiting 15 more minutes we were brought the wrong food AGAIN. Did I mention if we wanted more drinks we had to walk up to the bar because we never did see our \"real\" waitress, since the only one we saw kept giving us excuses about how she was so busy (this place wasn't full AT all). After asking for the manager we kept getting a waitress telling us she was the best we were going to get. The manager finally came and again, excuses. I will never dine here again.",

The bartender single handily ruined the night for the group with rude comments and D bag behavior.  At one point he called out some people in our group over the PA system to stop cheering about the beer pong tournament because they were annoying. This caused a few of them to be insulted.  They were not out of control or anything... just gave a woot to our friends who were playing.   But hey no worries, Mr. Bartender,  I'll never suggest to any of my out of town guests, who are looking for some fun, to spend any of their money at Blondies.",

Tasted like pre-made, previously frozen food. Hangover burger was ok. Had to add an extra $2.99 for a side of fries which was a huge portion. Made the mistake of getting their poutine. Gravy had no flavor, cheese curds were more than half way to being cold when they arrived at the table. We were deliriously tired and didn't want to bother with complaining. The only pros about this place is the beer and TVs to watch games. So don't expect too much out of this place outside of that.",

They were out of most of their beers (probably thanks to it being New Year's week). Out of our group of six, none of us were overly impressed with the food. My turkey wrap was okay at best and the pizza was disgusting.  Service was slow and almost dismissive, despite the fact that they weren't overly busy.  There was a very loud group taking up the entire back half of the restaurant. I of all people totally understand others wanting to have a good time, but the guys who came over and insisted on \"starting up a conversation\" with our group of girls (a.k.a. making a poor attempt to hit on us) disturbed the end of a below average meal and also got in the way of us trying to pay our checks. I would have had a more pleasant experience eating fast food. Perhaps if we wanted to just stop in for cheap light beer and beer pong (ugh) we would have enjoyed ourselves more.",

There were at least 4 other restaurants advertising cheap breakfasts.  This place had a sign for $2.99 eggs, meat and potatoes.  When we sat down I immediately noticed that toast was extra and guess what?  It was $2.99 too!  They also charge $2,00 for coffee so they actually are more expensive than the other places.  On the positive side, the food was good and the service quick.  As a plus, it's a sports bar so all of the tv's had ESPN on which I watched while I ate.  My wife and I split an order of toast to get a sense of satisfaction.",

So we started out paying $40 (a person) for the UFC  fights with an \"all you can drink\" (well drinks but expected) and sat in what seemed to be some large storage rooms with screens. Still cool we we're here to watch the fights, drink and eat. Waited 15 minutes before I stood up to look for a server, another 5 before we got one. Anther 10-15 for the drinks. The entire night there were no designated servers for the area. Now being involved in the industry we tip large from the beginning and keep it going to keep the service up. It's how it goes. Not here. In fact myself and several other on MANY occasions had to get up to find service for just SILVERWARE. Next time I'm just ordering the fights, over cooking my own frozen food and watering down my own drinks. Buffalo Wild Wings here we come.

We used an Entertainment coupon which allows for one free entree when a second is purchased.  The husband had the club sandwich and I built my own burger with cheese, mushrooms and a friend egg.  We both really enjoyed our food.  I liked that they didn't overcook the egg!  It looks like they have some great specials.  We noticed there is a happy hour special for all you can drink beer for $20 for a three hour period... wow, you could go crazy with that.  You have to understand though, that this place is very loud and while in the Miracle Mile shops, feels kind of ratty.  But, hey, it's a sports bar.  I'd eat there again.",

Whether if you're a die hard fan or just a simple casual fan who's supporting your friends/family/significant others team, this restaurant have great atmosphere.   One of the few drawbacks with Blondies is if you have your heart set to watch the game here, you would need to make reservations pretty far in advance. You can do that by either calling the restaurant or make a reservation through their website. With walk-ins, it's pretty much the luck of the draw. If there's an open seat available at the bar, you better take it. First seat you see, you better sit your a$$ down because we walked around the restaurant hoping to see an open table somewhere and by the time we wanted to go back to the bar area, those seats were taken. All within 30 seconds.  The food was good. Typical bar food. We ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, patty melt and we shared this BIG OL BASKET of garlic fries. Such a huge portions of fries....I'm kinda fried-out for the month. (And for those who know me, I LOVEEEEE MY FRENCH FRIES.) But ugh...no more. =/  Overall, pretty decent place to watch your Sunday football games. Boyfriend can grab a seat at the bar, get a drink while the girlfriend goes shopping for a bit and then join the boyfriend later. =) Perfect Sunday, right folks?",

She even didn't know if they had lemonade or how many slices were in a small or large pizza. Also she was unable to keep the drinks filled. Another issue was that she brought us napkins silverware and plates after we were done with the appetizer. The meals came out and 2-3 were done great unfortunately the burger that was ordered well done came out medium and was told to us that it wasn't put in as well done another issue with the server. After dealing with all of this we spoke to the manager Keith and he was really a great guy. He apologized for the issues and gave us his carb to talk to him when we come back. I would say he made me feel like he really listen and would deal with the issues later on today. I literally went from a 1 star to 3 because I feel he really cared.   I would hate to say this but the comment of Von M. Of Blondies not wanting to realize hostess are not waitresses and wanting to compare pilots and stewardess's are not the same as waitress knowing the menu. Makes me go back to 1 star. Thanks Von.",

    "text": "Blondie's target patron is the sports fanatic that is willing to belly up to the bar for an extended time to watch their multiple screens, drink, play beer pong on non sporting event days, and have a good time. Thank you Blondie's, I'll gladly accept the invitation. They are a sports bar and they make no bones about it. I would not recommend this place if you're expecting a quiet, peaceful meal with gourmet food. Blondie's hits the sweet spot for NFL Sundays and March Madness.  We clocked in just before noon on the first Thursday of March Madness and clocked out around 9 PM. Definitely reserve a table online for busy days like this. We didn't reserve a table and started out at the standing room by the back bar. By around 3 or 4 we had four seats across on the back bar with Daniel taking care of us. The minimum spending amount per customer that day was $45, which we had no problem meeting.  We had an unobstructed view of about ten screens all day with just a wave of the hand to Daniel for another round of drinks any time. The specials that day were a bucket of 5 beers for $25 and $6 shooters of Jameson, fireballs, or Patron. We had 7 buckets of beer, multiple rounds of shots, and plenty of action on the games. We did order a large pizza, a chicken quesadilla, and curly fries at some point, but honestly, I don't recall how any of it tasted at all.  The only snags we ran into all day was the restroom situation and the distance of the sports book. The restroom had one stall and one urinal only. With hundreds in the bar drinking, it often created a line out the door. Also, the sports book is about a ten minute walk to the front of Planet Hollywood. With long lines in the book, this leads to about a half hour trip to the sports book if needed. So place your bets early or have a mobile sports app.  Yes, we were gouged on beer prices (we basically paid $175 for a case and a half of bud light), but I had a great time with my buddies and our neighbors and we were paying for the entertainment value. We had better views of the games compared to a sports book. And we had plenty of action all day and won a little scratch. It was a memorable experience and I would do it again in a second.",

Food was mediocre bar food at best, not worth anything near the price we paid for it!  They had everything but pepper  on the table, wanted to ask for pepper but our waitress was in the kitchen talking. I was surprised when we got the check and a 20% gratuity was included. We left what we thought was fair considering the service we received  (15%) and the waitress followed us outside to let us know we had short changed her. When informed of that we didn't think she deserved that amount she told us \"It is called a tip, and it is mandatory!\" We ended up just walking away.  My least favorite part was about 2 hours later when the stomach problems started for 4 out of 5 of us. All 4 of us ate the hot wings (which were probably the best part of the meal) and ended up with stomach issues for the rest of the trip!  I don't think I'll ever eat here again!",

We met a group of friends there as they were finishing up their mediocre bar food.  We sat at a tall patio table but were never acknowledged by the waitress.  Instead, she walked passed us many times but never made eye contact. I went up to the bar to order a beer and to grab waters for our table.  The bartender was friendly but he informed me that there is a minimum if you want to pay with a credit card.  Luckily I had cash to pay for my beer. I'm giving two stars instead of one, simply because the bartender was nice. Overall, a crappy experience.  I wouldn't go back.",

The owner or manager was rude to people and just took money out of their hand as they were paying without being inviting or thanking people or making eye contact with guests!!!! During the fight the sound was lacking and would completely go away.  The first time we were like okay whatever they will fix it. Wrong! ... it kept going away and just ruined the fight.  The manager should of at least showed up and could of explained what was going on but he would go away and his workers had to pretend like they were trying to \"fix\" the sound Also one of the servers could not simply walk to the trashcan to throw away a cup full of ice, she rudely threw it instead and it landed on a women next to me!!!.  They need to work on their customer service and try to be more friendly!.",

We waited another 20 minutes to order our food, but it came out in probably 8 minutes (Which makes we wonder when it was actually cooked/prepared). We had no forks/napkins, and would not get acknoledged until our meal was about done.   Payment: I complained (we were at an hour 30 minutes now). They gave a small comp (which is better than nothing) and even was greeted by the manager (who never actually said he was a manager). After that, I just walked to the bar to pay, because, well.. I was tired of waiting.  Overall: Poor service. Medicore food. I would not ever eat here again. They need more staff, and possibly get rid of them beer pong tables.

Maybe it was super cool a few years ago, but as for now, I beg to differ.  The hostess asked if we would be eating, and we told her yes.  She then told us to grab a seat anywhere we'd like.  We sit, and another woman rushes over and tells us nobody is serving that section.  Strange, since the place isn't huge. But anyway.. we sit elsewhere and she comes over and asks if we would be eating.  Yes. Then she made some rude, unnecessary comment about the hostess forgetting to give us menus.  We ordered our drinks and decided to go with the appetizer sampler.  It was about $22 and came with a few different appetizers.  Honestly, all were bad.  I understand that most bar food is fried food.. but c'mon.  This stuff was literally drenched.   You could taste the oil which was so unappetizing.  My weird husband must have been starving because he said it was alright.  I deemed everything inedible and let him have the rest.  For a drink, I opted for the amaretto sour.  The sweetest, weakest $8 amaretto sour in the world.  It strangely tasted like cherry kool-aid.  What's up with that!? I never really read Maxim Magazine before, but after this.. I don't think they can be trusted.",

We had a group of about 20 in Vegas for March Madness and we were all thoroughly impressed (this was our second year in a row coming here).  The only downside (outside of proximity) is seats are limited and it's a bit of a shark feeding frenzy when it comes to finding a table.  The wings were awesome.

Called Blondies and was told that they would have the fight, and that the cover charge would be $40 a person, which would include all the beer you can drink. SCORE!! So on the way over to Blondies, I call to make sure there's still space available, and am told there is, but the cover is now $60.....hmmmm. Okay. Still not terrible since it includes drinks. Well, then we get to the front to pay our entrance, and are now told it's $80!!!!!!!!!!!! I explained that I had just called minutes ago, and was given the $60 price. They didn't give a crap. Bottom line (it's Vegas after all) is to make money. The guys working the front were fairly rude, which makes it even worse when handing your money over to them.  Well we decided that since we were already there, we'd suck it up....and pay. I didn't want to use all my cash so I proceeded to pay with my debit card. Oh darn, they only take cash!!! So one of the rude guys tells the little waitress to show me where the ATM is located in the restaurant. She takes me right to it, and then I turn around and she's gone???!!! So I get my money, go back to the rude goons at the front and stand there FOREVER while they just ignore me. Then it hit me, Hey, I'm in this joint. You want to be rude jerks?? Okay, cool. Me, and my money (safely back in my pocket) are winning this round. I found my boyfriend inside and drank PLENTY OF FREE BEER, and watched the fight. For nada, zip, zilch!! Ha Blondies, suck it. I win.   The money I didn't spend here, I spent the next day at the Pub at Monte Carlo. Way better place to watch sports, and have all inclusive food/drinks. No surprises on the price. When I called I was told $40 all you can drink....when we got there,$40 all you can drink!! This is on Sunday's btw. So you can post up and watch football and have a GREAT time. So save yourself the bs that is Blondies. Go elsewhere. Where they're honest about prices, and don't act like idiots when you get there.",

The only thing I ate good here was the curly fries (and the honey mustard...and definitely the dill pickle....and my unsweetened ice tea)  Oh btw.......you have to buy a small water bottle here...which is a $1...and they give you a cup with ice....  There is a happy hour from 4-6pm...$10 all you can drink Bud, I believe....They also have this HUGE pitcher of beer which is great for a group of friends...(forgot the price, but it's very affordable!) You can also play beer pong here too!  The waitresses were dressed in skimpy cheerleading outfits, which many were not very tasteful in. Don't eat outside unless you want to hear a load of noise during your meals, since it's right across from that performing arts stage with acrobats! It's a bit quieter inside, even if the sports games are on. It could get very LOUD though when there's a big game!",

    "text": "If I could, I would give this place an in between 2-3. The food wasn't awful but it wasn't great. My husband and I sat out on the \"patio\" area at a high top table. The service honestly wasn't bad and our experience was brief. I was actually really excited about this place. I liked the idea of a girly sports bar as a girly sports fan and I dug the waitress and hostess cheerleader uniforms as a former cheerleader. It was cute and seems like a great place to catch a game and a beer. It's a little small but they have a ton of TVs (as one would expect in a sports bar!) I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato for $10 and it didn't come with fries. What kind of restaurant serves sandwiches without fries? For $10!!!!! My cheese wasn't melted all the way so the sandwich was doomed from the second I laid eyes on it! My husband got a turkey club. It was nothing special but again, no fries came with it and it was around $13.  While they weren't the worst sandwiches we have ever had, we feel as though the place is a complete rip off. Though, most places in Vegas are the same way. We were just extremely disappointed.",

Spent about 2.5 hours here from 7PM-9:30PM when the fight ended.  Ended up paying an additional $70 for a couple servings of french fries and hot wings to go along with all the beer and alki.  The server chick we had was pretty attendant to us considering how packed this place was for the fight.  We paid $100 a head and got seats and our own server while a lot of other people paid $60 and I believe they had to go up to the bar to get their open bar drinks.  I really thought we'd all get a lot more drunk since we all threw down $100 each, but I'd say on average out of our group of 11 dudes, we probably only put down about 3 beers and a shot each.  I got a 3 beers, a shot, and 2 jack and cokes.  Could've done more, but the stomach wasn't liking me that night.  Not sure if it was the food or the previous 2 nights of drinking in Vegas.  Place is alright overall, nothing special.  Just another sports bar & grill with a bunch of TVs and server ladies dressed up like cheerleaders.",

    "text": "We went in for breakfast and it was worst experience at a restaurant that I've had in at least 5 years.  Service- Slow and nobody was in there and they had enough waitress on staff. Our waitress had an annoying high pitched voice. I would suggest she gets out of the restaurant industry and join the circus.  Coffee- Terrible. When it was suggested that the coffee wasnt good the waitress said the coffee is terrible here but she was glad to get a fresh pot of crap coffee going for us....yum. She should have just served up scolding coffee and dump it on my crotch and have the bar tender throw the cream in my face.  Meanwhile it is taking forever just to get water to us.  Food- the food finally comes out except for my friends who had to sit and watch us eat half our meals before he got his. BTW he got the same thing as everyone else. nothing special.  My meal was Chicken fried steak and eggs. Kinda hard to screw that up. First off they successfully failed. The piece of meat was thin and small to begin with (thats fine) but they over fried the steak. And they served it already cut down the middle (as if they were checking if it was done). The gravy came on the side and looked soupy. Almost Man sauce like.   I almost felt like  the restaurant cook wanted me to get on my knees and dump hot gravy on my face.  Meanwhile we are in a sports bar right? Well my friend was looking at one direction of the bar that was just showing rap videos (he said he wished he was Tupac'd) and I was facing the projection tv that was completely angled wrong. I felt like I was Biggie Small'd.",

So I thought the groupon would make it a decent price for a tourist trap and it was bar food, so we could find something there.  I looked online at menu and prices.  When we got there every item was $2 more than online.  Upon walking in, she went to sit us out on the walkway, but we asked for inside to watch the game.  Then she took us to the back where many tables of rowdy and obnoxious people were playing beer pong beside our table.  We asked to go back out front, but in the meantime, the odd waitress \"yelled\" and I do mean yelled snidely at the beer pong people that their food was \"taking up her table\"....well, they were doing what they were paying a hefty price for... ordering bad bar food at hefty prices as well as wasting and drinking a lot of beer.  However obnoxious, they were the demographic.  That being said, I am not.  So unless you are currently going to \"keggers\" you need to find another dinner spot.  The food was horribly cheap and generic boxed food.  Three waitresses were having a disagreement behind the bar.  Two business suit pervs were feeling up the waitresses.    And while, the waitress who yelled at the other customers continued to not ever smile, she was actually working hard and efficiently, just minus any smile or happiness.  She did keep us refilled and said thank you when we left.    Pretty much, this place was a complete cluster f.  (and for me to use that term is the only way to describe it).  The vulgarity is the only way to describe the place.",

I guess our server was \"done\" with us.  You can't get a glass of ice water here. Well, you can but you have to pay for it. A bottle of water only, for several dollars! No tap water served here. No glass, no ice. Weird. Well, it's the \"water is a top commodity\" thing......  Ok, time to pay. Our hotel had given us coupons. We each had $10 off. We didn't want to do anything strange. We were just two couples who wanted to split the bill. Don't try this here.   Our server would not, could not, did not split our bill. It had already been rung up she said and no way to change that now. So, we could only apply one coupon and she wasn't happy about that even as the bill had been rung up. She saw the coupons when we sat down but said nothing and did not take them. Had she perhaps not been in such a hurry to get back to her friends, maybe she could've paid more attention to our order. Then she went into her diatribe about us not having told her we were using coupons from the get-go, blah, bah, blah. Ok, whatever! We did, but whatever!  If this place wasn't so pricey for the rotten food (and no drinking water), we would not have wanted or cared about getting any $ off at all!  She said we could take it off her tip.  We did.",

    "text": "After catching a show at the nearby V Theater, wandered over to Blondies when it was still located in the Aladdin Resort & Casino name.  It was probably a Tuesday, and that meant all you can drink beer and well drinks for $10.    Walking into the back, tables of beer pong were in full action and it reminded me of fraternities gone wild.  There were even girls making out for the mere sake of making out in Vegas and having guys gawk at you.  (It wasn't even that late yet and the girls were far from drunk!)    Bartenders were less than friendly, probably because they aren't making any tips during all you can drink beer nights.  And with that crappy attitude, what's the point?    It's a bit of pain, they won't even let you in to eat or watch the games on the television without paying the $10 up front.  So, that part sucks alone.  They make you wear one of those bracelets anyway saying that you paid for all you can drink, so why not let other people in to eat?    I personally wouldn't bother returning. I'm not interested in revisiting college frat life.  But if that' what you're looking for or am missing, swing on by!  You'll fit right in with your Greek letters.  They apparently have a happy hour here too.",

There are so many other places we could have and should have gone to for a quality meal....like GR's Burgr! At least that place in Planet Hollywood is definitely worth the wait.",

The staff is great & so much fun! They have improved the look of the place, by adding a ton of tvs. The food is always good, try the chicken strips, & the bar is always full! Beer pong is $5 for setup & the cost of the pitcher. They have about 8-10 beer pong tables depending on the night. It's only a handful places left in Vegas that offer beer pong nightly. I highly recommned Blondie's as your official pre-game place! If you're looking to watch a game/s & NOT be at a sports book, this is one of the top 3 places on the strip you'll want to consider.",

Our bartender was extremely nice and went well out of his way to make some decent lemon drops, especially considering the fact that its a sports bar where lemon drops are not usually a specialty of there's.  Overall, the drinks were ok, the bartender was extremely friendly and the place supposedly gets pretty packed when the games are playing which is when they have some special prices on beers and so forth, but in all honesty, it definitely is not  a place I would look forward to stopping in again.",

You call yourself a sports bar?!? On top of that, pathetic (next to none existent) service- why would anyone come here?  Updated as I was about to send this - they FINALLY got the game on.  Raised my review from one star to two.  I feel sorry for my server - she tried hard to get the game on but the bartender looked pretty clueless on how to find the right channel.  Train your staff better!",

We were very impressed with not only the cost ($50 for two, including bottomless mimosas at $20 a head) but also with the service Jacqueline gave us. She was very nice, quick, and made sure that our drinks were always full, unlike a lot of places where you wait forever when you order bottomless. The food was really good, and we're keeping Blondies on our list when we come back to Las Vegas!",

I walked over to them and as I did, 3 of the waitresses got up and walked away. I asked the one that got left behind if she knew who our server was for our table and she replied \"nope, but I guess I will help you.\" Like it was an inconvenience. She came and took our drink order and food order. They were not busy at all, so ridiculous! I will never go there again or recommend this place to anyone. If anything, I will recommend people to avoid this place. The food was mediocre and not worth the trouble or BS. Horrible experience. Do not recommend.",

Sat down and ordered some drinks and food. 45 minutes into my evening while eating, Im asked to be removed from my seat stating \"this table is reserved\"  Ive been sitting here for 45 minutes and was pretty insulted to be told to leave my own table. The short african american \"gentleman\" was very aggressive and standoffish and didnt seem to realize asking someone to leave their table during dinner is very unprofessional. I asked to be given another table and was told to go sit at the bar, which had no seating available. After complaining for 10 minutes I was moved to another table in the corner.   After sitting down for another 20 minutes with no server, I overheard the girls saying \"I dont want to help a two top\" and never had anyone help us. They never even filled our table we were removed from.  The agressive man working the door claimed he was the manager and wouldnt be offering us any compensation.  Hopefully the general manager of blondies understands what kind of horrible management he has running this \"establishment\"",

Why we can't we get service like this in SF?   Blondie's awesome happy hour, $20 all you can drink from 3pm - 6pm, is basically happening when y'all are hungover and basically in a stupor sleeping in your hotel room.

Our server was very attentive, friendly, & funny! She came back a few times to the table to check on us making sure we were ok with everything, cracking little jokes here and there. Her name is Roxie. I will definitely ask for her next time I'm there.   The Place has a good atmosphere I will definitely return!",

We couldn't see the mushrooms in the burger.  They were non-existent!  And I had more lettuce in my BLT than anything else.  I little bit more than 1 piece of bacon in my sandwich, please. The only good thing I can say about this place is that there are a lot of televisions.  And when we asked if we could have a tv on a certain game, they obliged.  The servers were friendly, but I swear they had to have been tweaking on something.  I'm afraid to find out since some of them were so jumpy.  I really thought their boobs might fall out of their outfits.  Another good thing about this place is the deal for beer.  The server did point out it's cheaper to get 5 beers for $25 instead of getting single beers.  She knew we were there to watch football.  Good job, Tweaker!!!   Seriously, they need to get their food better, because it would be too easy to just drink when the food sucks.  And who needs more drunks in Vegas?",

My husband had the Philly Cheesesteak; this was also large. He said it was good but he wasn't blown away. None of the sandwiches some with fries, they are $4 extra.

Don't get me wrong, I know this place is tailored toward guys looking for chicks with hot bodies, a cold beer and some sports, but this place is in the middle of the touristy Miracle Mile mall, and should SOMEWHAT cater to everyone. However, it certainly does not.  I went here the first time about two years ago, and the service was ok. Some scummy guys sent over some shots, and the server did a pretty good job at making a joke out of the situation, and was pretty prompt with us.  However, the second time we went, our group was sitting at the table for about 25 minutes before a server even approached us. In fact, we had to go get someone to get us a server. When she finally showed up, it was quite awkward, as she didn't apologize, and then, of course, charged us for water. Unbelievable.  The food was not good. We had to track her down, again, to get our check. Never have I not left a tip. But this time, I was fed up. It should not take 25 min to get a table, and another 25 min after you're done eating to get your bill.  If I'm paying \"Vegas prices,\" I want better service than this.  Pretty much the only thing this place is good for, is getting a free shot after the American Storm Male Revue show.  Definitely not worth it.",

We had Burger for  $16 and Sandwich for $16 and shared an order of curly fries for the table.  A good selection of micro beers including nice Brown ale and the Goose island IPA.   I Agree with the comment posted earlier -- I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but wouldn't avoid it either.",

That way they can talk to each other and the productive people can work. Been coming here since the special was $1.99 and it's always the same service.",

I guess what had a red flag was when the hostess sat us literally next to the tv, and asked to be moved she walked away with no customer service. Second, was when a friend of mine asked where the bathroom was, the hostesses conversation was more important ( & I understand when deep convos are made you want to get your point in but the restaurant was slow enough for them to stop what they were doing). Lastly, they kept messing up on our order. If you're going to hire new bartenders the best thing you can do is cater to the patrons needs instead of making your own creation esp when the drinks you are making are bartender themselves.   Our serve was really chill which is why I gave a star but if she wasn't our server we would've walked out.   If I knew this was going to be a horrible experience, I would convinced my friends to eat at Cabo for a better dining.",

Due to bad review regarding one of their crappy cracked out severs we were asked to come back on owner vonns behalf for complimentary drinks. I decided to take my brothers into blondies for some drinks and appetizers. This time I chose to sit at the bar/ table  with 5 of my buddies. We ordered tap beers and some appetizers. Chicken wings, potato skins, nachos and some fried pickles. Bartender was excessively slow for how dead the restaurant was for a Friday. Food was just blah , bland bar food which was  under cooked and overly fried which hid the frozen flavor I assume. Waited around for this Vonn guy who claimed to be the owner but no one was able to get ahold of him.   All the of the staff were sitting in the back booth on their phones, and eating. I asked multiple times for side of napkins and ranches ( almost walked into the kitchen myself). Place is trash needless to say, restrooms were gross, next time use Mother Nature it will be a lot cleaner.   I just can't get with this place and I'm not sure why the health department continues to allow this place to run. Chicken bones on the tables and floors. Staff was less than helpful everyone was \"busy\" like my last experience. Trash was scattered all around the restaurant while everyone just walked over it. I wanted to throw up my blondies me  They need a HUGE makeover!!",

My daughter did not want tomatoes in her wrap, there were tomatoes and it was disgusting. When replaced they forgot to put cheese in it and no fries. Waitress stated the kitchen was a train wreck, she wasn't joking. The owner/manager was so very rude and escalated to calling security immediately when we disputed the 16.99 wrap. We were forced to pay but will never be back. The bar manager offered shots to fix the problem. My daughter isn't even 21 and they never asked for ID. We didn't want the shots anyways.",

Reservations were made which required a $400 deposit which of course went to food and drinks. I loved that you had a perfect view of the games that were going on from every angle of the restaurant.   The wings here are phenomenal! I couldn't get enough of the sweet habanero flavored wings. The mozzarella sticks were good as well, I forgave that they were a tad bit cold in the middle but still good enough to eat.   The service is a little questionable. There were 2 tabs ran that day, one for $1400.00 and another one a little over $200.00. Some people in the party were paying as they order, so I know a lot of money was dropped. I don't believe the service was worth it tho. We had to flag down our sever plenty of times, she really wouldn't check in on all the people in the group. In a couple in instances, when we would order rounds of shots, she would make us pay cash and said she wouldn't accept it on a card. Weird, it happened on more than one occasion.   If I was a server and I knew I was going to be making money off a 16 top, I definitely would be on my A game and made sure EVERYONE was doing good.   This place is definitely veered to tourists, but it still is a fun establishment",

The sports bar is a nice set up, as it is inside the mall. On the level of a Buffalo Wild Wings. The ticket was $299.95 (plus tax).  Once requested? The manager eventually came over to advise he compensated the ticket (before taxes, an amount of $50.00. Giving one bill without asking if there will a split: ISSUES AS FOLLOWS:  The order took over an hour to initially be pieced out in increments to the table. Baskets of warm fries being brought out up to 10 mins before actually receiving full orders (which caused them to be cold) and a couple of side order fries being totally missed. Total wait time of 1 hour and 50+ mins for all orders to be received, mini one order being missed. Once received the order was cold and return not eaten ( request to remove from the ticket received). This visit was exhausting. The waitress continued to blame everything on the kitchen. The bar was chosen expecting to enjoy watching a football game.  We visit Vegas 3 to 4 times a year. At least two of which in large groups of 12 or more.  This will never be an option.",

The lettuce wasn't super fresh but all in all it was edible and a totally fine bite for two tourists just trying to get to a show.   Get the fried food and you should be fine!",

She asked on her own so we were hoping it would get better or at least faster, but it didn't. The person who delivered our wings was not happy to be there and was very rude. My dad and my husband had a great experience at the bar the previous night and they weren't pleased at all.   We did get one drink and apps. We didn't stay for dinner after the slow delivery of our food, and especially after it was delivered by someone acting pretty rude.  The Chardonnay wasn't very good. The parmesan type chips weren't quite what I expected. The chips themselves were delicious, but the powered flavoring was unevenly applied  as you can see in the picture so that was disappointing. My family enjoyed the wings a lot and I thought the one I had was ok. I won't be back since there are so many great options.",

    "text": "The only reason this place seizes to exist is that it plays games on big screens.  We came to Blondies so my friends and I could sit down and watch a game since the Sports Book in the casino was packed. With that said, it will get crowded and loud but that was not the issue I had with Blondies.  I had an issue with the quality of the food and a bit of the service. The server was nice but not all quite there. My friends asked her what the soup of the day was and she looked puzzled, so she ran back to the kitchen to ask. We thought, isn't that something a server knows at the start of a shift? So alright, the server arrives and tells us the Soup of the Day is Tomato Bisquette. I think she meant Tomato Bisque. Anyhow my friends ordered the Bisque and I ordered the Cobb Salad.   The food arrived and my mates were not given spoons for their Bisque and we had to flag down our server. We asked for spoons and she looked down at her apron, patted it and said \"Ok Spoons\". We wondered if she usually kept spoons in her apron like straws. So again, she ran back to get spoons for their Bisques. They said it was good, I am glad because my salad was horrible! It was the most expensive cheap Cobb Salad that I have ever eaten. The whole thing tasted like one of those salads you buy at an airport takeaway kiosk! The lettuce was watery and cheap and the toppings were just scattered and not really appealing. I asked for oil and vinegar and was given both in little cups. I had too much balsamic but not enough olive oil, so I had to ask for more olive oil. Plus my salad was served in a plastic bowl, like those airport takeaway kiosk salads!  I am sure the regular clientele do not come here for the food as everyone seemed to have their eyes on the games. I can assure you that people don't come here for the salads! :(",

I ordered nachos which were 30 dollars after I added chicken, guac, sour cream, and Jalapenos, all things that should automatically come with nachos. The nachos were a pile of broken store bought chips covered in that terrible liquid cheese you pump onto chips at a movie theater. The chicken was some weird unseasoned ground flavorless stuff. The guac was also store bought, and the jalapenos came on the side instead of being in the nachos. Then since it's in the middle of the building there isn't much reception so I try to log onto the WiFi. It says you can do it if you check in on facebook or if you have a password. I asked for the password and they said they wouldn't give it to me, that I had to check in on facebook. I'll be damned if I'm going to advertise for them after such terrible food. I guess the 30 bucks I paid for nachos wasn't enough for a WiFi password. F this place.",

My only complaint would be the small and inadequate bathrooms - but, who spends much time in there, right?",

    "text": "I don't really remember how we ended up here, but something about this place seemed to suck the energy right out of me! This place being a sports bar, maybe it was due to the fact that there was no good sports playing that day? The Buffalo Wings were actually quite good, the Cobb Salad was not bad, but the waitresses were useless, only performing the minimal amount of work their jobs required and lacked any sincerity or personality! Water is not free, you are forced to buy a bottle of their Blondies branded water. The washroom was disgusting! For a place that wasn't busy, more time should be spent cleaning the washrooms. This place was a BIG disappointment!   Tip for the waitresses: If you're muffin topping, don't work somewhere where you have to wear a tight cheerleader outfit!",

It seemed hard to flag down a waitress, when i finally did i ordered some nachos that were pretty good.  Would probably go back here if i wanted to watch a sporting event that happened to fall in to their happy hour(s).",

We showed up as a party of 8 split in half for ease of seating while it was busy but not packed - many tables were empty, no line, between lunch and game time. I had a $15 pulled pork sandwich, fries were a few bucks extra. The bun was stale and the pulled pork was the mass produced overly tangy bbq goop you get in a tub at the grocery store. I ordered a can of Guinness which overflowed the glass after a proper pour, so either their pints run small or the glass was dirty. The service was laughably bad, missed and forgotten drink orders throughout, and we waited far too long for the check.",

I've went to this place a few years ago and remembered that it was not known to have to many good beers on tap, but it appears that may be changing soon.    I talked with bar manager, I believe his name was Lou, and asked if they had any specialty beers like IPA's.  He let me know that hey are going to start carrying beers like IPA's and stouts on tap, and he even gave me his last sample bottle of an IPA from Widmer, which was great.  So, it was a good start to the evening.  We then went back to the bar along the back wall, since the front was crowded, and watched the game on the 2 big screens in the back.  We ordered some apps, and I must say that the wings were excellent.  Good sauce and the size was very large.  I would recommend them for sure.  If you like kicking back with a few beers and watching sports, this is a cool place to check out.  Oh, and if you enjoy attractive female servers, that is also a plus at this place.",

I watched a male manager here berate one of the waitresses and tell her she wouldn't have a job anymore if she didn't wear more makeup, as she was in one of their skimpy little blue cheerleader outfits.

Wanted to have a quick bite, nothing to big & decided to stop by. It was during the week so the crowd was light. I really liked the sports bar. There was flat screens everywhere of course. The appetizers were awesome full of flavor, I ordered a chicken Cobb salad & that was delicious. They give you your monies worth. The waitress was attentive, although they did seem short of staff (but that could of been because it was a weekday). I also had a great Frozen Strawberry Margarita or 2 haha! I usually don't like margaritas but the waitress recommended it & I was impressed. You can actually taste the liquor. It didn't take like a Slurpee from 7Eleven w/cheap liquor. The bill was decent, nevertheless the waitress got a nice tip &  I will definitely be going back when I'm at Planet Hollywood.",

I was in Vegas last month to celebrate a friends birthday and we came here looking to drink and play some beer pong at about 1 in the morning.   When you walk in, you can tell that Blondie's is a sports bar.  College, NBA and NFL sports Team Banners hanging from the ceiling and walls. Waitresses dressed like cheerleaders and (noticeably) no male waiters, only bartenders.   We ended up getting a 64oz container of beer for only $35, which was perfect for beer pong, so we grabbed our cups, split up into teams (boys vs girls) and proceeded to attempt to destroy the boys. We failed, they beat us by two cups ... twice!  We stayed until 3 in the morning, a little drunk and very happy.  Good times all around!",

I was shocked! But I still wanted those damn garlic fries so I still let her snooty ass walk me to a table .. she tried walking me to some bfe table and so I told her I was going to sit at the bar for quicker service.  She stared at me like I was ridiculous, whatever.   Bartenders were clueless with their drinks .. wanted to get drunk after a weeks hard work but no where in PH gave me the chance. :(  If you're in PH just get some Earl's and gtfo :) Cosmo across the way has much better customer service AND drinkks!",

The white rice wasn't great and a bit hard, but I find many restaurants can't get white rice right. The sweet potato fries were good despite some powdered sugar on them (the waitress warned me that they come with powdered sugar). The service was just OK, and that's why I gave it one less star. The server never checked back with us, and it was really loud, but, hey, it's a sports bar. However, I would go back just for the salmon and perhaps the chicken caesar salad wrap, which my friend had. My friend said it was good, and it looked good.",

At around 7:40, I asked her about our food, she leaves then come back and tells us that she forgot to enter my wife's meal and says it will be right up. Tic Toc, Tic Toc, at 8:28 the food comes. The food was nice and hot, not bad, but not worth the wait. When the bill comes she leave it on the table and walks away, not a word! I open it and she over charged us for a extra drink, chips and salsa which we never had or ordered.   The staff is a bunch of young kids, they were more busy texting than helping out the paying customer!  Stay far away!!!",

I don't get it. Huge TVs everywhere, bar, wings, finger foods.   Came here twice in a weekend. Both times, there was no issue with customer service. Both girls were super friendly and helpful. There wasn't a lag in service at all.  I really enjoyed the sliders here. No high expectations or anything. Wings weren't bad. Sample platter was all fried, what do you expect?

Am I saying it makes up for their poor service and prick bartenders? Nope. But I'm just making a point.  I went here last night, pretty damn late with a group of guys (a majority of whom were Marines). We went to play beer pong pretty much and that is what we did. The beer pong tables were pretty packed and everyone around us was having a good time. It was pretty loud and fun and all the people around us were nice (tossing back balls, joking, just having a good time). It was 4th of July weekend so we were all doing what Americans do... drinking beer and yelling about how much we love America.  Would I go out of my way to eat here? No. Would I go back if I weren't with a bunch of Marines playing beer pong? No. But it's a fun time for what it is.",

Granted it's bar food, but I like bar food and the atmosphere is nice. We had tickets to a show at the V Theater and a Groupon came up for Blondies. So it was perfect. Eat, then walk a few steps to our show. We were seated immediately. Our waitress gave pretty piss poor service. We are not extravagant people. I don't need you to kiss my ass because you're serving me food. I just ask that you refill my water, and get me my food when it's ready. This waitress was bottom of the barrel. It took her forever to get our order...after walking past us telling us she'd be right with us. She then explained how it's been soooooooo busy and short staffed. I'm human, I get it. No worries. However, she was off doing god knows what and I see a guy in a t-shirt (a bartender, a dishwasher) I don't know who he is. But he kept running all her food. Um, ok. She's just walking around like she's got nothing better to do. Also, I'm pretty liberal. I don't care if you have tats over your damn eye lashes BUT sometimes what you wear does not go well with your \"art.\" She was covered in really bad faded tats wearing a cheerleading costume. The hostess was gabbing with two friends who came in for applications. She would gab with them. seat someone then back to dishing about how great the job is. UGH. Unprofessional. But the food was good, when we finally got it. Nice girl, but slow service. Overall, with a groupon or a comp or desperation would bring me back. But hopefully none of that is likely.

I had to ask one of the waitresses if she could send our waitress to our table. After that she came moments later. The pasta is $9.99 and you have the option to add meatballs or chicken for $2.99. My friend got the chicken and I got the meatballs and we both ordered the alfredo. The bowl was a good decent size and mines had two large meatballs. My friend finished his first and wanted his second bowl; but then he was told if he wanted more chicken he had to pay another $2.99. We were shocked, and so he ate his pasta without chicken. We then asked for boxes and they said they don't give boxes when the unlimited pasta is ordered. I asked to speak to the manager and he really didn't want to give us boxes. I told him you guys are only going to throw it away so what's the big deal of letting me take the food that I paid for home. One of his responses was we should already know they don't allow boxes with the unlimited pasta and he even compared it to running a red light! He said everyone knows not to run a red light. I told him that's against the law and its written in the handbook. Nowhere does it say you cannot take the pasta home. So to end it he says I'll bring one box and runs off; he didn't even give me a chance to respond to him. So, I had to stuff both of our food into one box. Even though the pasta was good I'm never going back because of that experience and on top of that their food is overpriced. We should've just went to Bubba Gump.",

We attended a show at the theatre the previous day and happened to catch this place out of the corner of our eye and had to try it. We all had great food, I personally ordered the sweet habanero wings which were the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. We all had ordered some other things including wings and the garlic fries, as well as chili cheese fries which were all great. However, the problem lies on the service. Our servers name was Jessica. She arrived at the table shortly after we were sat and we waited roughly 10 minutes just for our waters while she was busy talking and charging her phone. After our food order was put in (which was before our drinks had even arrived) we did not see her again for another 15-20mins. I had to get my water refilled at the bar because she was no where to be found, which was odd because there were only a few other tables sat and multiple servers around. Once she finally came back we asked for our checks, which she printed then stood talking to a non ordering table for an extended period of time when we were waiting to leave. Overall, the food was delicious, but the service is exactly what will never bring us back.",

So of course I said that's rude and they proceeded to start a chant calling me an \"ahole\". Fine I let that one go. Towards the end of the game when the other team clearly was about to win the same fans started the \"ahole\" chant again for no reason. So I asked the manager if he was going to let that happen at his bar and he said \"this is a sports game, get over it.\" I said ok I understand that but are you still going to accept this kind of behavior and bad environment at your bar? And he said yes. So I left the bar. My friends went to go talk to him and he said rudely \"you don't talk, I'm talking.\" Who says that as a manager? His demeanor in handling this situation was rude and demeaning.  I get that it's a sports game, but he should not one that kind of environment at his bar or treated customers that way. I don't know what his problem is but I did complain to upper management and I hope they will handle the situation accordingly.  Upper management was very gracious when I told them my situation and I appreciated that. As for bar management HORRIBLE! I don't know how he got this gig as a manager.  As an FYI it was an older man that was the manager on duty for this instance. He could care less about customers and only cared about himself.  No respect for other human beings what so ever.  So if you want to watch sports somewhere where they actually care and respect you as a customer, do not go here. I'm sorry to say this after speaking to upper management but other customers deserve to know what a bad environment this is.",

We started with the nachos, they were huge and very good. We probably could have just gone with the nachos for lunch the serving was that big.   We each had a burger, bacon and avocado on mine and bacon and bleu cheese for my bf. The burgers were very tasty and cooked to perfection. Add a pitcher of shock top and we were quite happy.   The server was nice, attentive enough but not always bothering us. Would go back next time in town.",

Nick was our bartender and he made sure to keep drinks in front of us. Found out later he was a member of management. By far the best service we have ever had. We'll definitely be back.",

I asked for a water and they waitress stated they only have bottled water!  I will never pay more than $1 for bottled water, so I ordered a soda.   The pizza was good. Our waitress sucked. My husband never got a refill on his drink and the cup sat there empty.  When the receipt came I was so angry to see a soda cost $4!!! Really?! So $30 was the total for a pizza for two and two sodas!   I would never come back here.",

My friends and I went to Blondies during there 7 yr anniversary, they has a 20$ all you can drink beer, which was awesome because we played an enormous rounds of beer pong. But when you first step into the bar the first thing you'll notice is the vast number of big screens they have. Second is the two bars they have in stock. Third the 8 beer pong tables they have ready for people to play. And to save the best for last the beautiful hostesses in their cheerleader uniforms.   This is a great place to watch sporting event, have a great time with friends, meet new people, and play beer pong. They have great hospitality, great vibes, great music mix, and a good price for a pitcher of beer for pong.   So I would like to thank Blondies for the great times they have given me and my friends when we were there. Special thanks to my bartender katie. She will always and will be my number one bartender for life. Much love and much respect to that girl.",

In a short time, our server--I believe Markiya was her name--came to take our order.  My wife ordered a Philly cheesesteak and I ordered the Reuben.  We were told that a basket of fries was better than two separate orders.  We got the garlic fries.  Both sandwiches were very large and very good.  The garlic fries were very good!     Service was good.  My iced tea was refilled a couple of times and I didn't need to   ask.  I normally would give a four star rating but the noise level was awful.  It was the first day of the college football season and there were some loud viewers in the main restaurant.  Also, being located where it is along the Miravle Mile Shops walkway makes for more noise.  A plus though is the oppoprtunity to watch tourists.  That's always a lot of fun.  Prices here are also high.  I can get as good in my neighborhood for less money and less driving.  Still, it was a good meal and I'm glad I tried Blondies after walking by all these years.",

Mine was a half-pound medium-rare burger festooned with lettuce, tomato, pickles, American Cheese, mushrooms, bacon, and fresh avocado slices, which was indeed a mouthful.  And Diane and I split a generous order of very fine and flexible elongated French Fries.  My party was seated in the patio area along the Miracle Mile directly facing a lively, overactive water fountain and the V Theater.  The mood was festive.  Service by cheerleader-clad waitresses was friendly, swift, and accurate.  And only some paper scraps on the floor detracted from the sports bar ambiance.  But, as many have said, food is king.

The waitress was a trainee, but she shouldn't expect to keep a job there long based on who her trainer was. Both could not provide decent or timely customer service. It took 10 minutes for me to get my card back after she (the trainer) took it to charge it, and we were her only table... She then tried to make small talk with me about the World Cup game that was on, hoping she could schmooze me over for a better tip. Lastly, the food and bar drinks at Blondies aren't anything special to write back home about, ether. But I will be contacting my bank and disputing the charge from this establishment. After receiving my statement, I have noticed that they overcharged me with writing in a larger tip amount than what I signed for. I will be calling management at this poor establishment as well, but from other reviews, it appears management is also well below standards.",

Everyone gets really into the games, which are playing all over because they have tv screens everywhere.    If you stop by, CHECK IN!  You get a free drink if you check in on Yelp.  They also have a ton of really great mixed drinks.  Even if you aren't a sports fan, you'll like this place.  Their menu has a lot of variety, so it's easy to find something you'll like.  (I hard a hard time picking my meal because there were so many great looking options.   Also, (especially for downtown Las Vegas), they have really reasonable prices.    Overall, the food is great, the drinks are even better, the atmosphere is fun, and the location (on the Strip) is perfect.",

    "text": "Having been given a $25 coupon to the Miracle Mile Mall restaurant (located within Planet Hollywood's shopping center), my husband and I went here looking for a filling yet fun dinner. The wait staff lives up to the Blondie's logo - female only waitresses sporting XXS cheerleader outfits, snug enough to showcase their tan stomachs and a hint of their bottoms. Forcing the feminist in me to get over the use of costuming and gendered employee selections (this is Vegas, after all), we made friends with our waitress, a Brazilian woman, and ordered water and sweet potato fries for starters, only to find out that the restaurant does not supply water but does sell bottles for $1 each. Typical Vegas nickel-and-dime tactic. The sweet potato fries were served with powered sugar on top and a side of honey - absolutely and unexpectedly delicious (the unexpected part based on the college-sport theme of the restaurant the constant advertisements for $10 all you can drink buckets of Miller). My husband ordered a Philly Chicken Cheese sandwhich, which was tasty yet quite processed and dry. My spinach, raspberry, and blue cheese salad was abundant in size and delicious, with plenty left over. Our choice of dessert was fulfilling: a rich brownie with ice cream and walnuts.  Hoping for a pleasant reprise, we returned to Blondie's the next week to redeem another <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a> coupon. To our dismay we saw a sign on the hostess station posting that the restaurant no longer accepts <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupons, and when asked why, the manager gave us no reason. They offered us a 25% discount in trade, which would not even be worth it considering they charge just for water.  Go to Blondie's if: You are dying to see your college team flag sported somewhere in Vegas; if you want some good sweet potato fries - only; if you want some cheap happy-hour beer deals; if you are more interested in foreign 20-something waitresses in skin tight, butt-cheek-revealing cheerleader uniforms.  Don't go to Blondie's if: You want a good deal; if patriarchal marketing tactics offend you (though this IS Vegas...); you have kids with you; you want superb food at a superb price. And finally - don't go if you have a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon!

What?  she then offered to bring it back and just throw the toppings that were supposed to be on it on there.  we said no bc its supposed to be cooked on. didnt even offer to get a new pizza. at that point another person at the table asked for a side of ranch and were advised it would be extra!!! we asked to speak to a manager. who happily skipped to out table. seemed somewhat childish, flippant and unprofessional for someone in his position addressing a customer complaint. each person who talked to him he litterally hopped to. he then offered to remove only half of the cost of the pizza bc half was eaten before we noticed it was the wrong one. to add to it the waitress said she couldn't bring 6waters with the food bc it was too much to carry. and then asked asked we wanted a box to take the rest of that pizza home...........horrible service. overpriced food and drink (oh btw. they brought the wrong drinks too), unprofessional and d effinately dont knkw thier own menus. one of our top worst experiences.",

I returned last weekend with friends and suggested the expensive beer can chicken ($17), remembering how good it was the last time.  Boy, has the quality declined!  Before, they used to fit an entire beer can into the chicken, but now, then chickens are so small, they have to use one of those Texas longneck style aluminum beer cans cuz the normal style could not fit in this stingy, malnourished bird.  Our table ordered two of these lame entrees, and both were undersized, dried out and tasteless.  Nothing like I remember it.  Water was free, but tasted like crap (unfiltered Vegas water, I presume).  My friend ordered a margarita on the rocks and had to send it back because it tasted disgusting and was the worst she ever had.  Veggies were overcooked.  An expensive meal for crap food.  NOT impressed!  Never going back there again.",

Had to wait about 3 minutes for the hostess to come out front and get us to a table. The floors here are bare concrete and the chairs have metal legs so anytime you move one it sounds like very loud nails on a chalkboard, starting off on the right foot. Get inside and the place is basically empty and the hockey game is on a big screen right in front of us which is nice. The waitress comes around maybe five minutes after we sit down. We order water and guess what they only serve bottled water! Can't imagine how much bottle waste they must have to deal with on a day to day basis but I'm sure they love that extra $1+ they get to charge everyone. And its not like were talking Perrier here you are just getting a generic plastic bottle with their \"brand\" on it. We ordered some wings they didn't come out  for a decent amount of time. When they did come out they were pretty far past  \"Meh\" on the universal-wing-scale.  Wait staff didn't come by the rest of the meal to offer us more bottles of water. Had to flag them down to get the bill and get out of there. Basically, if this place is this slow and painful on a slow Sunday I can't imagine what it is like when it is busy. Also, any place that charges you to buy bottled water rather than serve you tap better be amazing and serving you water synthesized from hydrogen gas and oxygen in their custom reaction chamber.",

I was blown away by the service and food, not to mention the TVs with every game showing.   I had a sweet blonde girl, Maria that recommended the ceasar salad. Cold beer, wings and the salad was awesome and so was the service..Maybe in the past, the service was poor but, I'm happy to say that I didn't experience anything like that. I will definitely be going there again for my football and their professional service, sports atmosphere and all the smiles in on the girls..   Thanks ladies!

Happy hour for $20 from 3-6pm includes all you can drink well drinks and beer which is a very reasonable way to kick off an evening or destroy the rest of your day.  I guess that depends on you.  I haven't tried the food but it looks like I shouldn't based on a lot of the reviews.    I'm just as bad at beer pong now as I was in my late teens (if not worse) but it's still fun.",

Then we ask for the wooden booth towards front and there are drinks on it and we would have waited but she led us back upfront and said she can put a 5 th chair at a 4 top, I asked if she can put two tables together she said no, here's your 5 th chair, and she walked away.  Terrible so-called fettuccine Alfredo. Our server Jessica seemed to be annoyed at the fact that my family sat in her section. She rushed to hear our drink order then she came back and I had to rattle everyone's order off as if I was an auctioneer because she had no patience. So when she cut me off as I was trying to ask her a question I stopped and asked if she was in a rush because I felt rushed. We had just walked 4 miles to get to the place because my 8 year old daughter wanted pasta with butter. So we trekked to find it. When we did find it we were relieved,and didn't know what we were in for. We are on a family vacation or I would have spent 1.29 to boil my own spaghetti to feed three kids at home instead of wasting $58. My veggie burger was ok except for the ton of seasoning salt that she probably told the cook to pour on it because I asked her if she was in a rush. Good thing I caught it before I ate it and I had to wipe it off with my napkin. I should have asked for a manager but I decided to be quiet and not get my girls upset because they were starving. Again , waste of money and never been treated so horribly before at a sports bar! Oh and drinks were filled right before she gave us the check I had to drink from my kids drink. The one star was for the sweet potato fries.  Deeply regret going there. Actually am upset my kids were present to see it. I have terrible heartburn also.",

And guess what it says 5 for 25 and then we were told that was the wrong price too and it cost more and they are aluminum bottles fyi. I can't say much about this place. Also another FYI make note that they have a hidden charge for using your card and not cash. It is on an itsy bitsy little sign on the front of the hostess table.",

Plenty of tvs for all kinds of events and they'll change it to your preference. Our server was friendly and we didn't wait too long either. I could've have ate twice as good at burgr, the ramsey place in the same bldg for about the same price. Just saying.

Pretty much your typical sports bar, vast menu, a well stocked bar and waitresses in skimpy cheerleading outfits. A couple us were in the mood for breakfast and a couple of us were in the mood for lunch and the Blondies menu had something for everyone. I opted for a big breakfast sandwich that sounded absolutely delicious on the menu but when it arrived it left a lot to be desired, only at about half of it, not so good. The biggest suprise was one of my buddies ordred a pizza, now being from Chicago I never expect much in the way of pizza when traveling outside Chicago but this pizza was actually outstanding, perfect neopolitan(NY) style crust and generous toppings  and portion.   All in all Blondies suited it's purpose, feed a group of us that all had a taste for something different, get some booze in our systems and watch the game. Good serve and ok food.",

We prepaid $300 each and when we arrived, the hostess stated, \"just a heads up, we're having negotiation problems with the MGM and may not be able to get the fight.\"  Our waitress finally broke the news that they hadn't met their number and the fight was a no - go.  They refunded our money, but there was no place for us to go to watch it.  Blondies management knew they didn't have the fight, but was willing to gamble with its patrons.  Do not spend your time and money at this joint...totally jacked up my fight weekend.  This place is a joke!",

We were seated outside and once the fights started they closed the doors to inside to watch the fight. I then asked my server if we could speak to him and the first thing he said was \"You again\". I simply restated my question about the different cover charge and said he wasn't going to argue with me. I told him I was not trying to have any confrontation, I just wanted to know if there was a different cover. We like to go Vegas a lot and the majority of the experience is always great.

It is conveniently located in the miracle mile if you are staying at Planet Hollywood.  The food is far below par, but they do have a fun environment.  If you are at a bachelor party or similar and want to watch the game this is a good choice as it is large and they have lots of tables.",

This place looked fun with the sports bar theme and TVs playing video clips. The outside (in the mall) seating was high bar tables and regular tables in the middle.   Our server Belle, came over quickly and got us waters. She was great. She offered us some suggestions and was always available when we had a question. I went with the burger as I was craving one. I was really expecting overpriced mediocre bar food, but was surprised by the burger I got. It was really good! Just a cheese burger with bacon, pepper jack cheese, and jalapenos - well done. It was served on a buttery brioche bun with all the usual veggies. It was greasy but that's what I wanted - wasn't looking for health food here. The burger was flavorful and a good sized patty. I did finish. Paired it with a Shocktop brew and was sittin pretty.   Saw another table serve up a huge pitcher of beer with a spout on it. Next time..next time... haha. Food was good, filling and didn't break the bank. I have plenty of other places to do that in Vegas. Vibe was fun with the cheerleader waitresses and music playing. Definitely worh a look for your sports bar / burger spot in the mall.",

She said, sorry, we don't have any tables.  Okay, then can we get on a list?  She says, \"I guess so!  With the game on, I just don't know if anyone is going to leave soon.\"  (She didn't really seem to want us there).  Another girl walks up and says, \"oh, there is a table right here.\"  Another girl says, \"No, that's for another party.\"  So we give them our name and walk towards the bar.  Before we make it to the bar, a waitress comes back and says that we can have that table because the other party doesn't want it.  Geesh people, make up your mind!  We ordered two frozen drinks that were a special.  Something black cherry.  They came from a machine on the wall.  They were SUPER frozen.  After letting it thaw out, we finally gave it a taste and YUCK!!!  It tasted like cough syrup.  I guess maybe we should have sent it back but they were only $3, so we sucked it up and each drank about 1/2 of our little glass in the hour that we were there.  I ordered the roast beef sandwich and fries.  My friend got the grilled chicken wrap.  They were both okay.  Nothing special.  The fries were just average.  The waitress we got was actually really nice, so we can't knock her.  She initially charged us $5 each for our drinks but then changed it when asked.",

Wellll we just got done with a show near this bar and walked in right after to get some drinks and chat for a bit before leaving.  Christina at the front helped up well and was super sweet.  HOWEVERRRR let me tell you about the rudest most unprofessional bartender with this very ugly mean attitude. So we walk up to the bar and the girl (according to Christine her name is Daniela) I kindly asked her how much would the drinks were and if there was a drink menu so her response was \"it's 5 dollars shots and 7 dollars for the drinks\" but the problem here was her tone and her loud shouting.  Very extremely rude. So obviously we did not order anything and we asked the hostess what the bartenders name was. We told the hostess Christine also that we were leaving and we sat by the fountain to decide Where we were heading . This bartender comes storming yelling AGAIN!!! Saying the hostess said you're asking for me what do you guys want ? Her tone of voice irritated me so much I said we had told her we were leaving so we are not ordering anything.  She goes again shouting \"I have a bar full of people what do you guys want\" like what the heck!!!!  We left we are not inside your bar could you be polite and watch your tone!!! Very disappointed.

When we arrived we were promptly seated, and given menus. We weren't ready the first time the waitress came around, so she left, and we waited for a good 15 minutes for her to come back. Finally she came and we ordered. My mom and were feeling the same thing, grilled cheese and tomato soup. So we ordered, and we waited. We waited at least another 25 minutes, but mind you, when you are super hungry it feels longer.  During the wait, I needed to use the restroom. Somehow I didn't see the restroom sign, so I went and asked the hostess. She was startled when I approached her because she was in her phone. After seeming annoyed, she showed me where it was.  The first thing I noticed about the bathroom was that it was very dirty. I actually waited for a different stall, because the only other one available had urine on the toilet. When I went into the other stall, it was of mediocre cleanliness. It wasn't as awful as the last one, but it still smelled awful and there was toilet paper everywhere. I felt dirty after leaving that restroom.  After leaving the restroom, I go back to our table where our food has finally come. The grilled cheese was luke warm, and I'm not even exaggerating! There was a single slice of cheese, and it was only half melted. My mom brought this to the waitress' attention, and even she agreed this was unacceptable (Especially after waiting SO long..) She took it back, and brought us menus to order something else.  Again, after this she was gone for another 15+ minutes!!!!! When she finally came to take our order, we just ordered two apps to share. We ordered tacos and chicken strips, and at $12 or $13 for chicken strips, they didn't even come with fries!! OH well, its vegas right? So we ordered and continued to wait. Again, after ordering the second time it was at the VERY least another 25 more minutes until we got our food. I asked for some extra ranch, and that alone took 10 more minutes. Mind you, I didn't mention that they were so slow when we were there so I am not sure what was going on.  The ONLY good thing about this experience was the food. The chicken strips were hot, and so tasty and the tacos had just the right amount of spice to them. My mom said the tacos were luke warm, but I thought they were fine. I mean the meat inside was hot, can't expect the lettuce and other fixings to be hot.  I wish I would have remembered our waitress' name, because even though the service was slow, she was super nice and very apologetic toward us, and even took $7 off of our bill so that was a plus.  After all was said and done, we were there for the better part of two hours. It was kind of ridiculous, but we left full finally. I'm just glad we didn't have plans or anything after cause we surely would have missed them  Also, for what its worth, not that I care, but none of the waitresses on staff were blonde when I was there, not one!",

    "text": "What surprises me is with all of the bars and places to eat and drink around Vegas, literally 100's within a mile radius of this joint you think they would try harder.  I was unfortunate enough to stop by with my son that just turned 21 on this day and we sat at the bar.  A young lady (bartender not cheerleader waitress) asked what were we drinking, I ordered a shock top and son ordered a beer as well.  She asked if we were eating and we said no and she got a grouch look on her face and turned away.  She plopped our beers down and that was it.  She later gave us our check but during our drink we decided that we wanted to grab some food.  We asked the lady for a menu and she gave us one.  We waited 20 minutes, while the whole time we see her talking with her friends, drinking starbucks and doing nothing.  She eventually came and said oh what did you want to eat.  I was furious, I said we waited 20 minutes and that was crazy, asked to speak with a manager, she said she was the manager.  I find that hard to believe.  She said, \"well you originally said you didn't want to eat\"  I said, \"well I thought I made it clear 20 minutes ago when I asked for menus and said we decided we wanted to eat\"  She then proceeded to tell us that a girl was on break and she was swamped.  See above on my comment on what she was doing the whole time.  I said was it because the way I was dressed.  Sleeveless shirt, basketball shorts and sunglasses, she got defensive and said no.  Well trust me, I had money to spend and lots of it, but I refuse to go anywhere and beg for service.  The kicker was I paid 20 dollars for two beers!  I strongly suggest to avoid this place and try the gazillion other establisments in Las VEgas.",

I ordered a side salad, potato skins and hubby ordered 1 dozen of barbecue wings. He said the wings are good. My potato skins are the best I have ever had! because they are super crunchy outside and soft inside, topped with crispy bacon and scallions. They taste like deep-fried baked potato. The best part is that the sour cream came on the side, so the crispy potato skin did not get soggy. Also they put the salad dressing on the side without me asking, so you can decide how much you want.   Atmosphere: Tons of different large TVs with more channels than I can watch. I am not a sports fan but I was thoroughly entertained.   Service: The bartender did warn us that the potato skins would take 15 minutes to make, because they are made to order. He is exactly right with the waiting time! Attentive",

Aside from the food being fast and delicious, the price was reasonable for a meal and drink on the strip. The best part however was the service. We were welcomed warmly by the host Joanna and as soon as we were sat, we were quickly greeted by our server Savannah. The service was excellent and was made even better by her warm cheerful attitude. Although it seemed a bit busy and she was running around a lot, she answered any questions we had and gave her suggestions and gave thorough service. Great place to grab a bite and a drink and watch the games. Highly recommended",

    "text": "We went here for the Cotto vs. Martinez fight, got here an hour early and the place was packed. The man at the front entrance stated the fight was going to be displayed on the outside entrance of the bar, we waited on the outside for awhile, we were lucky enough to grab two seats, the two male bartenders were un-attentive, couldn't get a drink.  The black male at the front entrance later made an announcement the fight was going to be displayed on the inside of the bar, and since the demand to watch the fight was so high they were going to start charging everyone there to watch the fight, complete bullshit, they advertised online that the fight was free, we called in to double-check the fight was free, when we got there we informed the man at the front entrance we were there to watch the fight, he let us in then 30 minutes later tried to charge us? After we argued he said we were fine, that we were grandfathered in since we were there before they decided to start charging people.  Now we were upset because we wasted 30 minutes outside of the bar to find a seat, when we could have been inside waiting for a seat. When we called earlier they said they didn't take reservations, when we proceeded to the inside of the bar there were 3 tables reserved, no one sitting at them to watch the fight.  Once again we were lucky enough to find seats on the inside at a table of 4 with only 2 guys sitting there, they were nice enough to let us share the table.  Our waitress is the only reason there is 2 stars, I'm not sure of her name, but she was very nice, very understanding, and decently attentive for how packed the place was.  The food, we got a Chicken Caesar Wrap and a side of fries, the wrap was full of lettuce and very little chicken, I got 2 quarter sized pieces on my half, we assumed the chicken would be grilled as most are and instead it was deep fried. The fries were very soggy and greasy, they weren't bad though. The price on the menu for the wrap was $13 and some change, we got billed $16 alone for it and some change plus tax. Menu error? Waitress error? 2 Touch Pos system error? Who knows.  Now right before the main fight starts, a waitress comes to our table and places a reserve sign on our table without saying a thing and walks away. We yelled to get her attention, she came back and said our table will be reserved for the fight, we said we were watching the fight, she told us we would have to pay for the table PLUS have to pay to watch the fight. COMPLETE BULLSHIT, I don't know who manages this place but you don't advertise a free fight on the internet, you don't tell people over the phone the fight at your bar is free and that you aren't taking reservations and then decide to change your mind, to charge people for the fight, to charge people for tables, and start taking reservations because the demand is high  to watch the fight, unbelievable.   After arguing with the lady and telling her who we talked to and what they said, she went to confirm with him, came back and said we were fine. Not one person in this bar knew what the hell was going on, completely disorganized and chaotic.   While watching the fight a man that was very intoxicated fell and hit his head on my barstool, he could have injured himself very badly, I'm not sure who his waitress was, but it was her job to cut him off long before he got to that point, after he fell and hit his head, he couldn't stand up on his own a friend had to help him, even after that, he still didn't get cutoff. If this place continues this type of service they will lose their liquor license.  The only reason I would come back here is because our waitress was so nice, other then that management needs to get their sh*t together, that's not how you run a sports bar.",

We actually stopped at Ketchup first, but the employees had horrible attitudes and the menu was extremely limited. So off to find another place since we knew there were plenty of food places. And we ended up at Blondie's.  We walked in an the first issue was seating. There were plenty of seats in this bar, a frat boy's dream. We didn't sit outside since it's in front of one of the 2 theatres here and therefore quite loud. We went inside, but a man (we later found out was a friend of our waitress) leaning WAY back in his chair.  Then we moved all the way to the back room where the tables are made specifically to play beer pong. There was a group having fun and playing all the way in the back. That wasn't an issue until the table next to us decided (after we sat down) to move to the table behind us and start playing. So we moved again.   Finally at a suitable table, our bubbly waitress came by and took our drink orders (don't order the iced tea, it's grossly overpriced). I ordered cheese sticks and onion rings and my sister ordered a steak quesadilla. They were both good, basic sports bar food. Nothing more, nothing less.   It is a sports bar through and through, so remember that. Including the bathroom. Ugh (I only washed my hands).   P.S. The Italian place next door looks lovely. I wish we had tried it.",

We decided to hang out because we had such an amazing server named Christina, she got our order in quick and kept the cups filled!

Thanks again Christina hope you can see this maybe when we come back to see you we can buy you some shots for you!",

    "text": "maybe a 1.5 stars for me, maybe.  so my friends and i stroll in here while our trek through miracle mile shops at planet hollywood. the only reason why i walked in here was for the beer pong. another beer pong joint on the strip besides oshea's?! awesome! of course i compare the two: oshea's wins hands down. cheaper and better service.  so my friends and i get a table here, get our beer and set up. round one, i lost, that's cool, there really are no losers in this game anyways (that's what i tell myself when i'm stuck with more beer than i can handle). then again, i already had a 1/2 yard of some sort of vegas juice in my system, so i wasn't feeling like chugging more down. a friend gets more beer and we are setting up for a next game. next thing we know, we are all being told to finish up our games b.c they are setting up for a ufc fight. they start taking down tables and take cups to re-fill our pitchers. excuse me, wtf?!?! why would your guys at the bar sell us beer for beer pong if they know you're gonna set up for a fight in a bit. that's some shady ass shit!!! so i ask where can we sit to finish our beer. \"go talk to the hostess honey, all these tables are reserved.\"  \"honey?! who you callin' honey?!?!\" then i start on some rant, yellin' and throwing punches in the air, one of them actually punching one of the bartenders out! as the rest of my fellow beer pong patrons cheer me on and join in on the ass kicking fun!!  yeah, that never really happened, but all i gotta say is that you got a place with bartenders sportin' mohawks, seriously, every single one of them had one! i dunno if it's a requirement, but that should've given me the clue to stay away. douchebags might as well have been wearing ed hardy shirts.  we ended up getting a seat b.c we just sat down at a table and a waitress came by with a menu. the food was your typical bar food. but i was inebriated so my mini corn dogs and fries with honey mustard sauce was poifect fro my drunchies.  the only reason for 1.5 stars is the beer pong, i will always have a place in my heart for beer pong.",

    "text": "We were looking for a good place to do happy hour where the boys could watch some sports. Lured by the $20 all you could drink 3pm-6pm, Blondie's seemed like the best choice closest to our evening shows. Well, started off rocky when it took nearly a half an hour for a waitress to come to our table. When she got there, we promptly told her we were looking for the $20 deal. Well, you go to the bar for that and when you need a refill you go back to the bar, she took care of food orders. Ok so we ordered some food and went and got our first rounds of drinks. Bartender was a little sarcastic but hey so am I. Second round of drinks? Not so quick and more attitude from the bartender. 3rd round? We had to wait in line at the bar and bartender was, dare I say it, a little ruder still. By the time we felt as though we had gotten our money's worth, we had worked pretty hard for our beers. In addition, our waitress came to our table and asked if she could give us our bill as her shift was over. We were all done eating so no problem. Well we sat there another hour and a half and our waitress was still helping other tables, giving us the impression she didnt have to leave but just didnt want to tend to our table any more. All in all, pretty lackluster experience at Blondies.   As for the sports on the tvs for the boys? Well there was for the first hour until the infomercials came on and no one bothered to change the channels.",

    "text": "I don't usually write many reviews but after my terrible experience here I was quite compelled.  So I went to Blondies in Las Vegas for the first time this last Saturday night.  It seemed like an \"off\" night (because there were only a handful of other people there besides my fiance, me and the other couple we were with). I can see why there weren't many people there on a Saturday night NOW.  The expensive food didn't bother me, as it is kind of expected when on the Strip.  The fact that they only had bottled water (as far as water goes) that they charged for didn't bother me, because I don't like tap water anyhow.  What bothered me was my encounter with the bleach-blonde, curly 'fro-ish haired, Irish (so he mentioned) bartender.  He was quite the d--che bag.   So my group and I were seated and served our drinks and food, all was going well until the bartender started his shift and cranked up his (terrible) music. Now I understand that in a public establishment, I'm not always going to hear my music of choice. But he had turned up his music REALLY LOUD. Like louder than in a club loud. When we were all having trouble hearing each other and the waitress, the waitress mentioned that \"he always does this\" and that she hated it because she couldn't speak with the guests. This music was pounding in all of our heads and killing our buzz. If I wanted to dance at a club I'd be at one, but we wanted to eat so we went to a d^mn restaurant. So I decided to speak with the bartender himself.  I asked him if he could please turn it down because I couldn't hear anyone and it was just too loud. To my suprise, he told me that we could get our food and sit OUTSIDE where there were no speakers. This really pissed me off, but I maintained composure.  I told him that we weren't going to move tables and asked him again if he could just turn it down, so he copped a childish attitude and turned the music all the way down. I told him, \"Look, you don't have to turn the music off. I'm not being unreasonable, I just wanted you to turn it down a little.\" We continued to bicker and he turned his music back up, so I went back to my table, asked for the check and couldn't get out of there fast enough. My fiance had to hold me back from more words with the bartender on the way out. I was PISSED. I've never been treated that badly at a restaurant before, as I consider myself very reasonable and polite. Don't eat here, unless the d--che bag is gone. Maybe then it won't be hell.",

They have $20 all you can drink beer but we just settled for pitchers. Their beer selection was pretty disappointing for a sports place but luckily they had preseason NFL games to keep us occupied. Inside of the restaurant reminds you of a dirty 'ol college bar so I'd recommend sitting outside, unless you like the whole frat house beer stains everywhere thing.",

Our waitress Cassandra was absolutely wonderful! one of the best servers we had in Vegas. Our bloody Mary's we ordered were a little too spicy so she brought us some tomato juice to calm it down. For how busy they were our food came out about 10 minutes after ordering and was great for the price. I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast!",

Sound is also on the hockey game. Asked staff to change the sound and got an emphatic NO based on ownership's strict instructions to keep hockey sound on. After talking to nearly everyone at the bar there were 2, TWO people watching hockey and the managers on staff were not able to TRY to talk to the owner (lack of effort didn't even try).

I only ate there with my family and friends because the line at the renowned Spice Market Buffet was over an hour and a half long. The wait staff is pathetic, everything on the menu is overpriced, and the food was not even mediocre. You will end up paying $23 per person for a soggy burger, limp fries, and a flat drink.

We chose to eat there cuz my bro in law had bets on the basketball games, so we figured we would go watch the games and drink some beers. -First problem is he asked for a glass of water to go along with his pint, the waitress said they only sell water for $1. Can you say, Illegal? -Second, all of the tv's were on sports center while the games were on. We asked our server to change a tv that only our table could see to the game. She responded with \"all of the tv's  have been requested to be on a certain channel by other guests.\" The place was practically empty. -Third, we ordered a $7 chips n salsa started and received half a basket of chips and prepackaged salsa. I asked for a refill of chips and she said she would ask about refills, and never came back.  -Four. They had a special for a gallon (ish) personal table beer dispenser. I asked for that with the \"blondies\"  brand beer and was told they only fill it with buttwiper products, even though it says nowhere on the menu that it was restricted to that brand. -Five. the food sucked. I didn't expect much from a sports pub inside the miracle mile.. but this was really bad. -Six and final. I asked to speak to a manager and I addressed all my concerns list with him. As for the water, he told me it cost money to wash the glass so they can't give free water. I just spent well over $100. I think that can cover the rinsing of a glass.  As per the TV situation. He told me that it is first come first serve, but he would be happy to put a game on for me. (we're done eating now and don't care) As per the chips. He said he will get us more chips. Again, we're done eating and don't care.) As for the beer special, He told me that the menu should say its restricted, but won't do anything about it. I told him it was False advertisement and he compared his restaurant to a STRIP CLUB in saying that just because they say you're buying a lap dance doesn't mean you're not going to get a BJ+.  He blamed all of our problems on the waitress and told us not to tip her if we weren't happy with her service. I responded with fact that it was his fault because he is in charge and even if I didn't tip her, the company would still tax her for it.  Overall, I will never go back to this dump.",
