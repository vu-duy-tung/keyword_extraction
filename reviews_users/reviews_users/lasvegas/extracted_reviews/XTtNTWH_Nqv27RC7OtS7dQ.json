    "text": "So let me start off by saying that out host was polite and go us seated right away. Mind you it was 10pm on a saturday night so the restaurants only had 3 other tables filled. Before we ordered he was very attentive asking everyone in our table whether they had allergies or not. The problems comes after we order, I understand we had a party of about 10 people so the service would be delayed a bit however we did not expect to be waiting over 1hour and a half for our food. Now the food seemed to be reasonably priced (I ordered a filet minon medium rare $49). So not only did we wait what seemed an eternity but the food was  mediocre to say the least and that might even be shooting a tad too high. My filet mignon wasn't evenly cooked and even worse more than half of it was rare! When I brought it up to the hostess attention he said they can only try to cook what ever portion was left. Any and every place I have been they will serrve a new portion. The jardin burger my GF ordered was overcooked  and dry.  This was a birthday dinner for a good friend of mine that pretty much ruined our night.",

Fabulous, unusual, and I will order these items again and again!!   A beautiful atmosphere: flowers everywhere.  Service was attentive, professional, warm, and knowledgeable.   I would have liked a more extensive cocktail menu. And their whiskey pours were pretty short.  Not cheap, but I thought a reasonable price for the high quality.    We also had breakfast here: the lemon ricotta pancakes weren't very good: they were super bland, and came with fake chemical maple syrup instead of the real stuff. Make sure to specify to get the real!   I'll be back!! Hoping they continue to improve this already great place.",

Currently writing this review as I wait for my server to pick up the payment for my check... it that's any hint as to how bad the service was, considering I have time to write it.  The food was DECENT, at that. The vibe and environment is beautiful. But NOT worth the prices at all. And not to mention, our service was incredibly SLOW, when our server was NOT busy. It's a Tuesday night. We had to ask for things several times before receiving. The whole table was almost finished eating before the birthday guy's food came out because our server never came back to check on us to know it was missing. We were here for TWO hours. 1 person ordered a drink, the rest of us has water, no appetizers or desert and this still took this long. It sucks when you pay a large amount for crappy service and sub par food..... Don't waste your time!",

When I came and she was whisking me to my table, she pointed at a tray of desserts and said \"You don't want to know about the desserts, do you?\" Um, I guess not. It was several minutes before someone cane to take my drink order. Apparently, my waiter Roger was busy so this fella was going to fill in for a sec. Ok. I ordered the Dandelion cocktail and some water. After about 20 minutes, same fella came back and said \"Roger is really backed up so I'll take your order.\" Mkay. I ordered the Buffalo cauliflower as an appetizer and the \"red curry braised tempeh\" for my entree. The cauliflower was really good. Then I sat there for an interminablr amount of time with an empty water glass, a crappy cocktail, and no breadsticks and watched a guy spend 30 minutes setting a table for 6 like he was Mr Carson and the Queen was coming to dinner. Did I mention the tables around me had bread? Then some guy with a ridiculous cart of copper cups asked me if I wanted a Moscow mule. No, but I'd like some water. At somepoint in this mess, my tempeh arrived and it was horrible.  When the person I assume was roger dropped the dessert menu on my table, I was Visibly ticked off. A manager of some kind came around to make nice since I was fuming. His excuse was that Mr Wynn was going to coming in for dinner. He comped my tempeh and I stormed out 37 dollars poorer. I hope for their sake Mr Wynn did not show up to that poor excuse for a restaurant.",

We thought about just walking out but then a waiter finally came. He was good, but honestly we won't be going back. The food wasn't the greatest, it was just okay and the waiter was good but the waiting around kind of blew it for us. I have feeling he wasnt supposed to have our table in the first place.

    "text": "Where do I begin? The initial greating by the host was equivalent to that of a mid shit Denny's host. Very flat and a demeanor of someone who is just passing through. Upon entering, perhaps its just me but my hat was on backwards with jeans and a button up. Normal I'm tired and need food ensemble. When told to turn my hat around I get a little pissed. I'm a 50 year old man. I'm far from  the age of being told how to afix my hat. But hey rules are rules so I acquiesced. After being greeted by a server who turned out to be FANTASTIC I settled on the chicken chilaquiles. A dish that I know and love. Once the dish arrived and I took the picture all of 1 min I bit into the dish from the bottom.  What resulted was cold sauce and limp chips. This is where the wheels come off. The lack of care into the assembly speaks highly of the line. In my opinion, it comes down to hey I'm cooking for the masses and they won't know any different. Epic failure comes with consequences. Obviously the meal was sent back and I ordered a VERY UNEVENTFUL bacon and eggs. The bacon was limper than an 80 year old mans Johnson. My advice,  find some line cooks who care about the preparation of the dish. Show some care and love. It ended with half eaten breakfast,  an apology by the GM, and a tip for the server. Come for the view and apps during the day maybe. Breakfast avoid.",

Our breakfast experience at Jardin was nothing but perfect. We asked to be seated on the patio. It was a bit chilly so we asked for the heaters to be turned on. The employees were very attentive and nice.  The Coffee: It is from Fonte coffee roaster in Seattle. Steve Wynn made a special trip up there to choose this coffee to be served at Jardin so it is super special and ofcourse one of the kind.....Just do yourself a favor and order it.  The Nutella french toast was amazing..... It had walnut on the top.... I don't like any kind of nuts in my food so for next time I will order it w/o them.  I don't usually say this, but if you find yourself within 100 miles radius of Wynn hotel, get to it.... Just to try that heavenly coffee.... Yup it is that Good!",

All entrees we decided to split to taste as much as possible. Chicken omelette substituted with egg whites was fantastic! Jack cheese peppers topped with a generous amount of avocado, their hash brown potatoes are small but incredible. Maine lobster Benedict was incredible eggs cooked to perfection and hollandaise sauce was on point and the sauteed spinach was a nice accompaniment. French toast came with caramelized apples on top I was a little apprehensive about because it looked like someone reached into a loaf of bread and decided to make it out of wonder bread. It was fantastic, maple custard and bacon was a pleasant surprise all in all one of the best I have ever had!!  I considered closing the meal with an antioxidant smoothy but I choose to just order pomegranate juice.",

There are brunch options for every taste here so it's difficult to be disappointed. We decided to start with coffee and some drinks- which were delicious but took about 15 min to come out, so I am knocking off one star for slow service. To my surprise my almond milk latte had a Mona Lisa on it, very memorable touch. If you are vegan there are some great options for you and the server knew what she was talking about. I ordered the \"just egg\" product, a vegan egg replacement that just hit the market and I was surprised to see on the menu. The potatoes were good too and my favorite color, purple. Our breakfast came with a side of toast, and they had wide variety of options for bread and even vegan butter. The ambiance outside was nice and not as noisy as inside and they do put out patio heaters if it's a little chilly. Overall great experience, will come again.",

Our drinks, meal, to go dish, and check all took SEVERAL requests from several different staff members before being brought to us. Certainly not what you'd expect when spending a bit of money on a breakfast. Three requests spanned over 15 minutes for a diet soda? A side of pancakes being brought out once everyone's done eating, despite the two inquisitions previously made at the arrival of the rest of the dishes.. not acceptable, and not worth coming back. They need to do a refresher on what it means to be AT WORK, instead of standing around in groups of 3, chatting while paying customers struggle to get their full meal and drinks.",

With just a bite and a dash of mancheco on top. Very very good.   The steak salad was just as good (the burgers that went by also looked unreal) and came with an actual steak! Not little strips, but a hunk of burning love.. hey it's Vegas after all. Then the salad part that was so well thought out and over by itself.   Service was so good and quick. Professional would be the word. And the setting was gorgeous as is most of the Wynn properties!   Lastly, a Bloody Mary cart went by with a smiling bartender. That I will save for next time!

Unfortunately, the rest of our experience was quite underwhelming. Our server was double sat by the hostess, so he took about 20 minutes to take our order and we probably waited another 20 minutes to get our drinks (which were delivered by a shaky, unapologetic manager). The only reason I know the server was double sat is because that's the first thing he told us when he came to take our order; he was visibly upset and made us all feel very unwelcome. The experience only got better when Mohammed delivered our food; that was literally the only time we felt welcome and accommodated. My friends were visiting from out of town and I was so excited to bring them here for brunch; instead I left disappointed and embarrassed for having brought them to such an overrated & lackluster establishment. Living in this city, we are spoiled with so many dining options and you expect to get the best of the best at Wynn or Encore but I've honestly had better service at Applebee's!",

I make Jardin my go-to breakfast or lunch spot because there is no other restaurant in town that understands or approaches complete breakfast/lunch service like Jardin.   The General Manager, Brooke, and her amazing staff work well with the Chef and the back of the house to create an amazing dining experience.   The hostess staff is pleasant and accommodating, the service is amazing and the food is top flight. The venue is down right gorgeous.",

Offering delicious cocktails and American fare, I went with the lettuce wrapped turkey burger and broccolini. Hands down best turkey patty I've ever had. Also the best twist to a Moscow Mule I've ever sipped on. The pool side ambiance is wonderful during dinner as well - just make sure you make a reservation on Open Table. This place can get pretty crazy!",

The place was very nice. Server was very enthusiastic and friendly. We only ordered entrees, which took around 45 minutes to arrive!  Unfortunately, once the food got there, it was ordinary at best. My steak (Rib Eye) was ok - but it was $45 for what would have been a $20 steak elsewhere.  Other people with me had the Fried Chicken (overcooked, not much flavour), the Organic Salmon (overcooked) and Turkey Burger (dry, not much flavour).  I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner at all. Maybe it's ok for breakfast/brunch, but it failed to deliver for us.",

I ordered many small dishes including their yellowtail tartare, Burrata, beet salad with smoked salmon,kale salad, and octopus grilled. All entrees were good with the kale salad being the best of them all.  For entrees, we ordered the short rib ravioli and a tofu with mushroom and Asian noodles. The tofu with mushroom dish, which is vegan, was outstanding, with phenomenal spices and a lovely overall presence. The ravioli was boring and a little too sour due to some strange sauce on top of it and it just was anything but impressive. Honestly, the best part of the meal was the pretzels that came at the beginning which are equivalent to a bread basket. The downside was they had a horse radish like butter that I did not enjoy but the pretzel sticks were so good that all else did not matter.  Therefore, it was only a three star experience and food is just OK. Very expensive. $125 per person with tax which counts a bottle of wine for 2, A few appetizer dishes, and two entrees. No dessert as way too full.",

We ordered tune poke which is raw fish; kale salad and desert. Me and my girlfriend got sick right after lunch. Had to to drug store buy medicine. The pain and discomfort didn't go away; I called the manager hours later lunch explained what happened he's said he has to call security to file report. Manager didn't ask what we ate and didn't offer to take off the bill. Security came to the room and file report and that's it. I checked out on 10/19/17 and had to pay for Jardin restaurant which we got sick from. I was very surprised that five star hotel and restaurant have these standards and don't take care of their customers. The only thing manager called and said that they did investigation and nothing was wrong with fish. Sounded like they didn't believe us that we got sick from eating their food. I was very disappointed and never will return to Jardin restaurant.",

The place itself is beautiful as we sat down by a big ball of flowers in the middle of the restaurant. The down side was that I had asked the waitress to bring out one of the deserts with a candle since it was my friends birthday but when it was dessert time, the waiter who brought it out just brought it out without a candle and didn't even put it in front of the bday girl which we specifically identified. Awkwardly, the waitress realized and took it back in, put a candle on the side and laid it back down and left. It was awk but we made the best of it.",

    "text": "Jardin recently opened at Encore, having replaced Botero and Society Cafe. The cuisine is essential Society Cafe, but more elegant and less casual, but in all honesty, everything at Wynn/Encore isn't casual. If you remember Society Cafe, you'll notice the plate ware and flatware are the same! (Save where you can right? :P) The food was all amazing, as was expected. The service was lacking just a smidgen but that could've been because our waitress was training someone else. The only hiccup was that she mistakenly switched our crab legs for another crab dish, and by the time the crab legs were ready, the rest of the meal came out.   For cocktails, they have a full bar of course but also a Mule Cart going around the restaurant making Moscow Mules and their mixed mules were amazing. We ordered the orange and it was great! We ended up ordering another each time he came around! If you have a big party, he can make a big one that services 16! For appetizers we had a flatbread which was basically an entire pizza. We expected a small rectangular size with maybe 4 small pieces total, but this was a full on pizza. But delicious nonetheless. As I said, we also got the King Crab legs. However, these weren't the same as you'd find in the buffet. My photo will show it's 2 tiny pieces already taken out of the legs. It was delicious but not expected. For our entrees, we ordered the oven baked prawns, which came on a bed of rice. There were about 6 prawns, decent size and deliciously seasoned. The rice was a bit al dente for me. We also ordered the short rib ravioli which was apparently great. However, you get like 5 raviolis. We had to get a side order of the oven baked mac and cheese which was a huge side order but delicious. And of course, what we were so excited to try was the potted planter chocolate cake. Everything is edible. You break open the pot and there you'll find the most decadent, non-overwhelming cake with dark chocolate mousse. A must try! But not just for one. We were 2 people and we couldn't finish it. Overall an 8/10 based on price vs. quantity ratio. Would go back just for the Moscow Mules and the cake!",

They (and the rest of the Wynn establishments) have a good handle on vegan options and food allergies. That said, our server was a bit confused about the difference between vegan and gluten free. It was all good in the end, although a word of warning is that they cannot make a vegan bloody mary, apparently (I'm neither vegan nor a fan of bloodies, but my friend is both).   That said, the food was great. I ordered the Three Egg Breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast. Everything was great, but the hash browns were something else - they were crispy on the outside, softer on the inside, and deliciously seasoned. I asked for my bacon extra crispy and it came out pretty close to how I like it. Our table shared an order of sweet potato waffle fries, too, and they were tasty.   Coffee was great and regularly refilled, and my bellini was delicious. Definitely sit outside if you can - they have a wonderful patio area!",

We were extremely disappointed in the Encore, and struggled to find a restaurant that was not filled with smoke, as they all front the casino floor, the smokiest by  far of all high end hotels we have stayed at in Las Vegas. Jardin is the only exception, as it sits away from the casino a little bit, and we were able to eat our one and only meal at the Encore that week, without being buried in cigarette smoke.  The staff is amazing, almost too attentive, but that's hard to complain about these days.  Like everything in the Wynn properties, it was overpriced, but we were glad to pay a premium for the privilege of still being able to breathe freely.  Food was great, though not excellent, so a four star review is merited.",

After receiving no service I went to go talk to the hostess about the lack of service and yet we still received no service afterwards. At this point we were fed up and we walked out. Keep in mind the restaurant was not busy and there were only about eight other tables. This is unacceptable service for a restaurant in a five star hotel. Will not be returning!  . . .  Update: Caroline reached out to us and offered a complimentary dinner for two. The restaurant manager met at the hostess table and we felt very welcomed as she seated us.

I'm not exactly sure what it was, but she enjoyed it.   I've noticed some previous reviews complain about the portion sizes here. Bah! I found the portions to be perfect, and I was full at the end of my meal. While some chain restaurants out there pump out huge extra, extra large sizes of subpar food - I appreciated the appropriate sized portion of food that was well flavored at Jardin.  The adult beverages we had were good. However, they only serve margaritas on the rocks - not blended - which I thought was a bummer.  Overall, a good experience and delicious food. We will definitely return.",

    "text": "I knew I wanted to dine at Jardin for 2 reasons: the Impossible burger and the flower pot cake.  I was happy to get both! We started with Tito's and soda and a Van Rose.  Both delicious.  My husband got the prix fixed menu while I chose to do a mishmash of options for my meal. I started with the \"beef' croquettes, which are made of the Impossible meat.  Basically, it looks and tastes like beef but is a pure vegetarian protein.  My husband tasted it and said that if he wasn't told it wasn't beef he wouldn't have known that it was veggie.  It's now more available at Umami and The Counter.  I got the chicken entree, while my husband had the crab cake and the filet. He liked his crab cake and the filet. I also enjoyed my meal but wanted to save room for dessert.  My husband received a butterscotch pot de creme and he enjoyed it. But I was waiting for my flowerpot cake.  It did not disappoint! It literally looks like a flowerpot and for $18, you got a large cake.  It is so good.  And when you make the first break into that pot, and the cake comes oozing out, it's so worth it.  The cake was rich and had a wonderful layer of raspberry jam filling.  It was rich, moist and enough to have for random bites over the next few days (when kept on ice).  The is not a cheap meal but with the beautiful garden and floral ambiance, neat looking colorful bar and great meal choices, I recommend coming here.  And get that cake to share with your table mates. So delicious.",

We had drinks and apps to satisfy our strip experience since we normally don't go down there, and weren't disappointed when we left.   Margarita on the rocks with no salt, Gin (Hendricks) and tonic, shrimp cocktail, and truffle fries were our poison.  The truffle fries were awesome and worth the $17!   So if you find yourself at Wynn and want a quick drink and food, give this place a whirl... cheers!",

    "text": "SUMMARY: Nice seating options and a basic menu that was quite good. The portions are sizable although the coffee was pretty bad. They do parking validation so feel free to park at the Wynn to eat here. If you sit outside, be warned that the birds will get quite close to you.   VERDICT: I would return here on my next excursion to Vegas (if that happens, ha!)  ITEMS ORDERED: (1) French dip sandwich -- I ordered this and it was HUGE. In hindsight I should have split something with my family (the prosciutto pizza was awesome and definitely shareable between two people) but it was so good. The horseradish wasn't overpowering and the au jus was a perfect complement to the sandwich.  (2) Prosciutto pizza -- huge pizza! 8-10 slices of thin-crust pizza that was also topped with arugula (although not the spicy kind, unfortunately!) (3) Lobster benedict -- my sister had this one and she seemed to think it was just okay, although I think she did probably enjoyed this place the least among the four of us.   Unfortunately I can't remember what my dad got (knowing him, some preparation of fish) but I don't remember any complaints from him. The coffee, however, is bad, and no amount of milk can make that liquid palatable to drink. Still, this was probably the most pleasant dining experience I had in Vegas in terms of the food served, so feel free to check it out (along with my reviews of places I did NOT like, in case you were curious!)",

The smoked salmon and eggs were delicious, flavorful without being overpowering, and filling. The most memorable menu item was definitely the flower pot cake, which is almost too pretty to eat. An Instagram worthy foodie pic! The cake was moist and not too sweet. Enough for a few people to share.  Service usually is pretty good, although it can be a little slow at times, even when the restaurant isn't busy. I've found this to be True at other Wynn restaurants, but I think it's because they don't want the diners to feel rushed.  Their menu is a bit pricey, but that's to be expected on the Strip and at the Wynn.",

We sat outside, which is a perfect people watching spot since it's adjacent to the pool at Encore.   Cocktail menu is small but mighty. Husband ordered the French Cucumber and I had a sweet & tangy passion fruit based margarita. Both delicious!   We ALWAYS order crab cakes if they are on the menu, so we ordered those plus the meatballs. Crab cakes were pretty good and a great portion for 2-3 people. Meatballs were probably the best I've EVER had.   For the entrees, I ordered the beef short rib - all I have to say is you're going to need a nap after eating it! It's served over a luscious bed of polenta, and the meat itself was so incredibly tender it melted in my mouth. Now listen, I had gastric bypass surgery a few years ago and I'm not supposed to over-eat. But I ate practically the entire plate. Husband ordered the seafood pasta. House made penne, and a ridiculous sauce so good he almost licked the plate.   I was too full for dessert, but we both ordered cappuccinos and a cake pop at the end. I wish we could have tried the Marshmallow concoction that included a presentation with dry ice, but my stomach was at the brim!   We will definitely be returning next time we're in Vegas!",

Pros: -Outdoor seating option; despite being near one of the pools, you don't feel distracted by it and it doesn't reduce the restaurant to a \"poolside snack shop.\" -No wait, at least on 8/9/16 -Nice ambiance and interesting decor (dark grey water glasses, nice, subtle green linens paired with white and black trimmed chinaware) -Attentive service -Despite having a daunting menu (in a good way), the dishes don't take too long to come out -They offer organic salmon -Dishes had beautiful flavoring  I ordered the healthy option kale salad and added organic salmon to it. The salmon was very good quality and cooked perfectly. No knife required, broke into perfect slices upon sinking my fork into it. The kale salad was equally delicious and had a very flavorful dressing mixed within it. The dish was very fresh and hit the spot!  My partner ordered the chicken, which was very tender and juicy.  I absolutely would visit this restaurant again. The only thing I would recommend they do is offer a few more options for each meat. For example, a few chicken dishes, a few salmon dishes, etc.",

Been coming here since it was Botero and to be honest I was quite disappointed when Botero was pulled out. But I've been enjoying Jardin ever since. I've never had a disappointing meal, drink, or service. Some must haves are the crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich and anything breakfast! They have an amazing Bloody Mary cart that comes around and makes your Bloody Mary to your exact specifications. Had the pleasure of Rick helping my group and I, superb service! Seriously amazing. Enjoy!",

It was reasonably priced for Las Vegas with an upscale environment but to be honest the food came out very slowly and wasn't super impressive. I had a good experience and would go back for the cake but maybe not for dinner. Also, the cake was split between 4 people and was not finished. It's huge.",

Jardin is located where botero was located. Very nice place that looks out on the pool. Beautiful. We had brunch. We really like some items in the society menu like the monkey bras,but nothing seems to have survived on to the jardin menu which is a bummer.  Jardin's food was pretty good.   Bennits with raspberry sauce good but not as good as the monkey bread from the old society cafe.  Chicken and waffles was good.  Buttermilk chicken sandwich very good.  Bowl of berries expensive but good.  Coffee excellent Adult cheese sandwich and soup was great.  Side of bacon wonderful.   The service was ok, not great 4/5.  The food was 4/5. Overall 4/5.",

I was so impressed with the way that they were cooked and prepared. Dessert was pretty good, but by then I was so stuffed that I didn't fully appreciate it.

Reception staffs seems to be soulless in my every visit. Perhaps, they ruin my appetite, but the food is just so bad.... Service is so so.

The Challah bread French toast was nice, but again, nothing great.

The restaurant itself is elegantly decorated with a garden theme, as its name would suggest. There's also patio seating but given it was December, we opted to eat inside. The lobster eggs benedict was $24 but worth the price. It came with ample lobster that was well-seasoned and cooked. I also really appreciated the sauteed spinach and classic hash brown to round out the dish. Lastly to note, there's a roving cocktail cart in case you're up for a boozy brunch!",

We ordered lunch and both got the chicken sandwich.  I got sweet potato fries and my husband got the side salad.  The salad wasn't too good but the fries were perfect.  Criss cut, flavored, crispy and perfect.  The food is nothing monumental, but it is tasty and good for a simple lunch.  Our waiter was really nice, and that always takes a three star restaurant up to four stars in my opinion.  You leave your meal smiling because the waiter was just that pleasant.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a fancy/special occasion, but for a simple lunch or brunch, it does the job.",

    "text": "Never again! I came to Jardin with 4 other ladies on 08/19 during my sister's bachelorette weekend in Vegas. We were going to XS later that night and wanted to have a nice dinner before hand. The main reason we chose Jardin is because it is close to the club and beautiful but the service we received was an absolute joke!   Our server came by and said hello and then we didn't see her for almost 20 minutes. Meanwhile other servers are hanging around our table noticing us looking for our server and not one of them came to check on us. When our server finally came back she simply said, \"Sorry I had to step off the floor\". So my first question is why didn't you let us know that or send someone to check on us? It's not like we went a cheap diner! This place is upscale so the guests should be treated that way.   Our food took FOREVER to come out. I realize it was a Saturday night but again the server never came and checked on us and the restaurant honestly looked like it was dead. Once the food finally arrived we were so disappointed. Luckily we were snacking throughout the day so we only ordered small meals because the food was just alright and the drinks were mediocre as well. The presentation was fabulous but the taste...not so much.  After we had finished with our food it took our server another 10 years to finally check on us and my sister in law asked her very nicely for our check and she asked if she could please split them. This server looked at my sister in law and said (with a TON of attitude) \"all 5?! Ugh just give me 2 minutes\". About 10 minutes laster she returned with checks, slammed them down in front of each of us and said, \"thanks\" under her breath as she was walking away.   At this point we were upset and wanted to speak with a manager. I have friends that are servers and I even worked in a restaurant for a short while myself so I completely understand that not every table can be pampered and that splitting checks can be a pain but with that being said this place was not cheap and the service we received was terrible. The manager came over and our server made sure to be very close pretending to do stuff so she could listen in to our complaints. All the manager said was \"I'm sorry for your experience let me get your checks\". After another 10 minutes goes by the server (yes, the one we had a bad experience with) came back with our checks and said very sarcastically \"I'm sorry for you bad experience, the manager took $5 off your meals\".   Why would they send the server who we complained about to give us our checks? Also it is nice that the manager took some money off of our meals but honestly $5 off at a place as expensive as Jardin is more of a slap in the face than an apology. We were not looking to get anything discounted or free but we wanted management to know about our experience so hopefully their future guests have a better time and the half hearted apology we received along with the $5 off seemed like they were just trying to get us out the door. Overall I was truly disappointed that our final dinner for my sister's bachelorette party was ruined by the horrible service and treatment we received from Jardin, I highly recommend anyone who is considering to eat here to turn the other way. Although the ambience and appearance of this place is fabulous everything else was subpar.",

    "text": "Impressed by the atmosphere, but not by the service. Jardin's menu and beautiful patio initially attracted us to dine here, so we decided to try it for dinner one evening during our most recent trip.  We were seated quickly without any reservations, but after being guided to a table on the patio, the hostess left and the service issues began.    From the beginning of service until we paid the bill, we were disappointed.  Our server largely ignored us, not being able to offer much helpful information about the menu or the wine list, making us feel like more of an imposition than an invited guest.  We had to flag her down several times throughout the meal to order appetizers, entrees & wine, and even to request our check (which took more than 15 minutes).  Other service members were not helpful or seemingly willing to help), so eventually we just gave up hope that service would recover and tried to enjoy our meal.  Thankfully, the food was delicious.  There were not many seafood entrees, but of those offered, the bouillabaisse was the best, filled with tender squid and buttery scallops, a surprisingly light and delicate dish that really challenged the idea of what a bouillabaisse should be.  The hamburger was also well-liked, definitely filling by itself or with a generous side of fries (it does not come with fries, so if you want them, be sure to order them as a side).  Overall, if you are in a hurry, Jardin is not your best bet...but if you have time to kill and really want to enjoy the beauty of the Encore/Wynn gardens, then Jardin may be your #1 pick!  Cheers!",

After receiving the food 2/10 people enjoyed their food as the rest did not. We all work concierge and for our first time dining here we are NOT impressed. The ambiance does not match the food especially not the prices. After taking some meals back to the kitchen we started to wonder why the manager NEVER came to our table to check on us and make sure we were alright. Instead we just got stares from the manager and everyone else working in the restaurant as if WE did something wrong. When booking this reservation we were told that they validate parking and never said anything about a limit because they clearly knew the reservation was for 10 people. So they tell us the can only validate 5 which was annoying but not once did we complain. Manny was a good waiter and did everything to accommodate us. As for everyone else they could really care less that we were even dining. Upon walking out Everyone thanks all the white people walking out but as soon as our large party walks out, all we get is awkward stares from every worker. They never offered us dessert, they never checked on us given the service we received and they never acknowledged the two people who came for their birthday. We will never come back and waste our time. If you like expensive food with no taste this place is perfect. If you want food with taste I would advise you to avoid at all cost. It is not worth it.",

After they take your order, they bring you out some fresh pretzels bread sticks with a mustard seed butter, and that is just enough to get your taste buds watering for dinner.  Their drinks? So Many great choices. Try one of their moscow mules, they have a whole specialty bar cart to come around to make you your perfect mule! I promise it won't disappoint.   The service was great, we interacted with a few and everyone was welcoming and patient. They also were mindful of when we needed to get going to be at our show on time. (Le Reve, check it out!)

I had the pancakes and my boyfriend had the smoked salmon scramble - both dishes were delicious. I should also mention that a very nice couple order a dessert that I was going to order for myself as a birthday dessert, but the couple offered to give me theirs because they were also full from their meals. Our waiter also brought out a scoop of ice cream with a candle and edible \"happy birthday\" message to pair with the dessert! I was so surprised by all of the sweet gestures.

I ordered the orange and lavender mule and the pork chop. The mule was fresh and light and a nice summer cocktail. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and the glaze was sweet and smoky. The pork chop was served with a cauliflower puree and an arugula and radish salad. We also ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and a side of the Mac and cheese bites. The meatballs were tender and the bites were ooey gooey cheesy and came out super hot. Jardin also starts you with pretzel bread twists that come out of the kitchen warm served with cold honey mustard butter.  We ended our meal with the famous flower pot dessert. It's a chocolate cake with chocolate mouse and raspberry sauce, surrounded by a chocolate shell, and topped with cookie crumbs and edible flowers. It's both gorgeous and delicious. The menu says that it serves 2-3 and there were 3 of us and we couldn't finish it. Honestly, it would probably be the perfect size for 4 to share unless you have a major sweet tooth (a quarter of the cake was enough to satisfy mine).   We will be coming back in the later summer or early fall to enjoy brunch outside because the patio looked lovely, it was just too hot to eat outside the night we went. That said, the dining room is brightly lit and gorgeous.",

The service was horrible. We were a party of 6 people and by the time we got our drinks ordered our waiter went MIA for a little bit. By the time he came back we just ordered our main dishes with no appetizer. I got the Lobster Benedict and I was not impressed at all. My Boyfriend got the Steak and Egg, which he was whatever about. Once we got our dishes we both just looked at each other like...??!!! We had finally finished having breakfast when we were looking for our waiter who once again went MIA. It took over 30 minutes to get our check. I felt so bad because my friends were waiting for us outside Jardin for 30 minutes till we got the bill. I will not dine here again.",

    "text": "Jardin is a Nice Relaxed Place for Breakfast or Lunch  I have been spending a lot of time in Las Vegas lately, and at the Wynn in particular, and Jardin is becoming one of my go to's for a noon-ish meal.  For my latest visit I opted for the classic Virginia Ham Eggs Benedict. Perfectly poached eggs, luscious, thinly sliced ham and velvety Hollandaise. The dish comes with a small crispy potato hash brown \"puck\" -- for lack of a better word. My only complaint is that I wish the potato portion was bigger. Not that I was hungry after I finished my meal -- I am just a glutton for crispy fried goodness.  In the past I have had a nice Caesar salad and the Margherita pizza -- both very tasty. And the pizza was HUGE. Way too much for one person. Easily lunch for two.  The other thing I like about Jardin is they never rush you out. Typically I am killing time waiting for my client. My servers have always cheerfully re-filled my drink and allowed me to catch up on my email while I wait for my meeting. And when I am ready, I have my check and I am on my way. And considering this is a very beautiful dining room, staffed by wonderful, attentive people in a five star hotel, the prices are quite reasonable. I will be back.",

    "text": "This is a beautiful restaurant that's in the same space where Botero used to be. I'd eaten at Botero several times and I thought it was one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas, so I thought I'd give Jardin a try. That turned out to be a mistake.  The service at Botero was always exceptional, but the service at Jardin was embarrassingly poor. This was a Sunday night, and Jardin was not very crowded. Asked for ice water with lemon, but after a wait got only plain water. Had to flag down the waiter to get some ice, and then again to get lemon...and that was just the start of the meal. Ordered a coffee and it came out warm after a 10 minute wait. Even though we were seated next to a wait station, the waiters were rarely attentive. After dropping off our long awaited food, the waiter (and his helper) disappeared until he asked for our dessert order. Never bothered to ask how our food was. Hint: it was not that good. The corn chowder was the worst I've had at any strip restaurant, which was surprising because the corn chowder at The Country Club at Wynn was always outstanding. Jardin's chowder was dull with very little seasoning, and was not served hot. The mashed potatoes were runny and were more like potato soup. How do you mess up something as simple as mashed potatoes, then have the nerve to send it out to a customer?  The salmon and the chicken were good but overpriced. The cheesecake was the star of this experience, but nobody ever asked how anything was. When it was Botero, a manager always came by to ask how everything was going, but not at Jardin.  All in all, a very disappointing experience. I thought it might have been just an off night, but there were just too many mistakes. I won't be back.",

My group and I celebrated a birthday dinner on a Wednesday night. Business seemed slow and there weren't many guests in the restaurant. Our orders took extremely long to come out. I ordered the \"Endless house made spaghetti\" (prices at $31) with a Caesar salad and garlic toast. I picked at the salad until they asked to take it back. The spaghetti was underwhelming - no seasoning or taste whatsoever. Only took two bites and decided to send it back. I was ultimately charged $8 for the salad I picked at, when I thought it was inclusive of the meal.   Working in the industry (especially within a 5-Star hotel), you already have an expected level of service. I will say that through our unsatisfactory experience, our server Manny, remained polite. The general manager did not come by to check and see how our night or dinner was going, albeit he visited other surrounding tables. I'm saddened that my expectations were low-balled tonight. Please, save your money and dine elsewhere. It's a beautiful venue but the food quality DOES NOT justify the price.",

    "text": "The worst experience in my life with reservations!  I made my reservation 6 months in advance for a party of 8. When I arrived to the restaurant, I was 15 minutes early and checked in with the hostess.  I was informed by the manager that my party was shown to their table already and pointed to them saying, \"the zavala reservation has already checked in.\"   I then pull out my phone and show them my ID and the email that shows the reservation and conformation number. Now this is where it gets interesting, now the manager says \"I don't have this reservation in my system.\" So the story changes...  Next, the manager has the nerves to point again to the same table and blames that table for taking my reservations. However, she just said I don't have reservations. And to top it off, they are blaming part of my family that are also part of the wedding group.  As more of the wedding party, that I am apart of, is showing up to the restaurant, the manager informs us that we will have to wait while they seat the bride and groom table. Of course that is fine. But they have not resolved my issues and ignored my group.   Finally, the manager apologies, just to apologize. And sat us down at a table. Funny thing is, the whole restaurant is basically empty with plenty of sitting. They could had had a 4 star review if they would have just sat us down immediately and managed the situation professionally.   I will not return.",

Martinis were good but ridiculously overpriced.  $23 for a vodka martini.  Ridiculous.  Anyway, I ordered the prime rib. It was one of the most unattractive slabs of meat ever served on a plate.  Fatty.  Dark brown.  Zero taste.  $40 for a sandal on a plate.  I couldn't eat it. Nobody asked if there was a problem when they removed the plate, with the \"prime\" rib largely untouched.    I've never been impressed by any Wynn / Encore restaurants.  For that reason, this place didn't disappoint.  I would try Capital Grill across the street.  Stay away from Jardin.",

The food was not good enough to justify the price. We had three entrees between us (Strip Steak, Chicken and Spaghetti). Only one of the meals (the spaghetti) was deemed \"good\". The chicken sandwich and the steak were definitely not, particularly given the price.  In summary, rude hostess, friendly wait staff, subpar food, and highly overpriced.",

We got the kale and spinach ravioli, the buffalo cauliflower, and the chickpea bowl. the portions are decent we definitely didn't have any leftovers but luckily they did give us bread so without the bread we probably would have still been hungry. I would say you could definitely get better vegan food for a much lower price many other places but when you're in a pinch and you're at the Wynn this is a pretty good option. during the day the Wynn hotel has much cheaper food options but at night time you're kind of stuck with more expensive fancy food so maybe another restaurant would have been better but this was the least expensive one we can find. Nothing to write home about as they say.",

I prefer the whites fully cooked and the yellow soft.  I don't enjoy the texture of runny white.   The hollandaise wasn't spectacular.  I ordered the fruit instead of the hash brown which was just a block.  It seemed like a creative attempt but it did not deliver.  The food itself, was good.  I enjoyed it.   Our table wanted mimosas for the brunch so they said they'll send over the drink cart.  The drink cart was unattended for most of it. No one came by.  The table requested this 3x during the entire meal and no one came by.  Even getting our waitress was impossible.  She was missing and the restaurant was not busy.  After we were done, the drink cart came by and asked what we wanted and sounded surprised when we said, we don't want anything, we're done with the meal.    From the service I received, I believe that management has not kept an eye on the employees and the employees have excelled in lagging or abiding their time during work.  Responsiveness was terrible and there must be some secret room where they all disappear to so they can't even be called on by us.",

We ordered a bowl of soup, flatbread, arugula salad and chicken meatballs.  We asked our waiter to bring everything out at once so we could share.  We then waited over 30 minutes for our soup and salad to arrive.  Ouch.  Every table around us was being served while we watched and wondered where our remaining items were (meatballs and flatbread).  And we waited. And we waited. Without apology, our last two items showed up after the salad and soup were long gone--at least 30 min later.  By then it was over the acceptable wait time and the patio chairs became uncomfortable and the other patron's smoke started to annoy us.  We had intended to go in for a few appetizers and got stuck in service hell.   In hindsight, I should've spoken with the manager but we were in a hurry to get out of there.  Enough was enough.   Definitely the slowest, most irritating service we've had in Vegas in a long time.  (Two stars because the meatballs and flatbread eventually were delicious.)",

It was good but nothing fantastic- esp when we waited so long. Had to ask for coffee refill. As we left my friend asked me if it was a repeat. I quickly answered -  no way.

Four of us sat down about 7:30 pm on 9/13 for a refreshment while we pondered going into the dining room for dinner. The woman didn't even crack a smile, make any welcoming comment and basically gave us one cocktail menu and immediately asked \"what can I get you?\". Nothing worse than not being fully seated and settled in and someone's harassing you for your order, and still not a smile to be had. We got up and left and spent out $360 on dinner at Chica at Venetian. Sorry Wynn/Encore-thought you paid more attention to the quality of your staff at your high end restaurants.",

    "text": "I would have expected more from an Encore restaurant.  While considering the pricing wasn't bad for Las Vegas, the food just wasn't that good. We did the fixed menu option.  They start you with a literal tea cup of cauliflower soup - it was basic.  Next We had the chicken meatballs and crab cakes as an app, both were actually quite good!  We both thought it was going to be a good meal... until the main dishes came.  I had surf and turf and my husband had the roasted chicken.  I don't think they used salt on anything.  My steak was disappointingly bad - over cooked and no flavor.  Shrimp was cooked fine but bland and they topped it with a type of pesto that didn't work with with of the proteins and didn't even taste good.  I actually took it off and pushed it to the side of my plate.  The broccolini was only slightly over steamed.   My husbands chicken was served over a bed of smashed fingerling potatoes with a hatch chili sauce and side of green beans. The chicken was cooked well, but again lacked flavor.  I pretty sure they don't use any type of salt or pepper when cooking.  They shouldn't even try to call the sauce any type of chili, it's a plain red sauce.  Never would I describe it as any type of chili, more like a tomato sauce.  The beans were just good ol' steamed beans.    They redeemed themselves with desert.  We had the maple pudding and apple crostata, both were excellent.  Wish I would have had more room to eat them.    The other factor contributing to the three stars is that the waitress went missing for a while. We actually thought she was on break.  My beverage  sat empty for about 15 minutes.    In nutshell, I wouldn't go back.  There's too many good restaurants in Vegas to bother with Jardin.",

Is the Wynn not a vegan (animal) friendly venue?! In my entire life, I have never been told to not feed a bird!!! Not only were we embarrassed by your 20 year old waitress, but disgusted that your staff would treat us that way when paying that much per plate, while sitting in an outdoor (vegan friendly) venue.",

Located right next to the XS club which is closer to the Encore side of the hotel. The ambiance is CLEAN & VIBRANT. So bright & BEAUTIFUL during the day time. They have a lovely patio seating w/ heaters but the inside is just as GORGEOUS with all the flowers. . The SERVICE met exactly what i expected from a restaurant on the strip. DREW was our server for our LUNCH experience & he was so KIND & ATTENTIVE & literally went the EXTRA mile to go above the expectation especially since we had 2 CHILDREN w/ us for lunch. One thing that really stood out was the fact that he got the chef to make a dish for the kids that weren't even on the menu.The manager also took the time to stop by the table &  greet us since it was our first time. She was definitely a bundle of JOY, she was able to keep the kids occupied for a little while as they showed her a magic trick which she literally stayed to patiently watch the child STRUGGLE to show her this MAGIC trick of his. This might be not big of a deal but being in the SERVICE industry i knew she had to get things done because after she PATIENTLY watched my nephew's struggles, I saw her go back & forth from the kitchen to patio at least like 20x within a 5 minute span. Whoever this BLONDE TINY MANAGER is..... Props to your PATIENCE & SPEEDYNESS while keeping a SMILE the whole time! it was fun to watch. . FOOD........ SO FREAKEN DERICIOUS!!!! who knows it might be because i was HUNGRY, but it was good to the 5 other people that were eating w/ me (including my EXTREMELY PICKY husband) . . . ANTIOXIDANT SMOOTHIE $9 - acai, pomegranate juice,  blackberries, blueberries, & maple syrup was PERFECT in flavor BALANCE. . AVOCADO TOAST $17 - black garlic hummus, cherry tomatoes, & black pepper. The most SIMPLISTIC yet flavorful. . GRANDMOTHER'S CHICKEN MEATBALLS $14 - backed in tomato sauce w/ ricotta cheese. This chicken was sooo TENDER & JUICY!!! Plus who could say no to Ricotta cheese.  . QUINOA & AVOCADO SALAD $16 - watercress, ucumber, toasted almonds, & lemon miso dressing. This salad literally made EVERYONE at the table SPEECHLESS. We were all expecting it to be not so tasty & just blah.... but it was seriously so good that it was DEVOURED INSTANTLY! . SHRIMP CAPELLINI $25 - roasted garlic, fennel, & lobster cream sauce. It was a subtle pasta dish which was perfect for a lunch item. None of the flavors were too much or overbearing. . FLOWER POT DESSERT",

The service is also pretty blah.  Its billed as a somewhat quick service at the Encore Resort so if you want something while you are here its one of the few places that is casual in the whole resort.  For me it was just way overpriced for what you get.  I'd rather go elsewhere and spend the same for something great or spend less for something probably better as well.",

    "text": "My husband & I had dinner here for our anniversary. I primarily chose Jardin due to the vegan options on their menu. However, the sample menus online had several more options than the actual menu! I had a mushroom tartine & spinach/kale ravioli. While neither were bad, they were both quite bland. My husband had the wedge salad, salmon and portobello fries. There was nothing special about the salmon, and the salad & fries were good.  The atmosphere was much better when this space was Botello. It has been stripped of its character and is very loud. If you are looking for a quiet, romantic spot with good vegan options, this is not it. We were disappointed all the way around & left with \"buyers remorse\"!",

For instance, we thought the creamer for our coffee was a little on the turning side, and mentioned it. We instantly had new cups, new coffee, new creamer and the old carried away.  The ambience is lovely, and the view of the gardens (Jardin) makes breakfast even lovlier.  We enjoyed our veggie frittata and chicken sausage and eggs entrees were very good. I especially enjoyed the frittata with sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, broccolini, manchego and parmesan.   I think my husband was a tad disappointed in the chickeen sausage. He expected something that was less like grocery-store sausage. But the taste was good.  The coffee was unlimited and very good also.  Expect to spend $70 for breakfast though. The loveliness costs!",

    "text": "After hearing that all the Wynn & Encore restaurants have vegan menus, I decided to give this place a try. I was really surprised to see that there wasn't an actual separate vegan menu, and only a few vegan items offered. Basically there was one salad, one appetizer, and one entree option. Unfortunately the entree option didn't work for me, and I asked the staff if they could put together a simple pasta with veggies. The staff was accommodating of this request, and the food was quite good. However, there was not a lot of choice. Bottom line, you will get a decent meal, but don't expect variety of options or choices.",

We started with a arugula salad: very fresh and delicious. Next i had some kind of bread with pork belly avocado and a few other things on top. It was awesome i never had something like that before. We drank moscow miles with everything! Easily one of the best mules i've ever had but it wasn't too strong.   Next we had salmon which was hot and crispy omg he outside. The dip it came with was good too. Last we have a small piece of steak: very well cooked and crispy on the outside. i love when the food comes burning hot it's really so important!   Last i had the banana bread pudding and signature pot dessert. Both were UHHHAMAAZZZINNG! Check out my awesome pics!",

So I dropped 40 bucks here and did not get what I wanted.  That is just awful.  Stay clear and save your money. What I had you can get just as good at Red Hot and Blue!!!

    "text": "Came back to Vegas about a month ago with my hubs. We always stay at Wynn as it is our favorite hotel in Vegas. After gambling for hours, like it was no one's business, we decided it was time for dinner.   From the outside, Jardin is lovely, no doubt. Every time I've walked by in the past, I always commented on how I wanted to try the place out. On this particular night, Saturday, it wasn't busy at all. We were seated immediately, so that was nice. It pretty much went down hill from there.   Drinks: Took forever. The alcohol is one thing, but the water and soda didn't come out until the food came out. My double vodka came first but took as long as it would if the restaurant was actually busy. (Many empty tables.) Server said the bar was backed up. I looked over and there was 1 person sitting at the bar. Yah, really out of control. The server had to bring out a cart full of alcohol for the table next to us. Super dramatic style as if the bartender was swamped af. I laughed, literally. No idea what that was about.  Food: Like I mentioned... took forever. Restaurant 85% empty. I actually ate part of the bread basket which I never do. So long... so hungry.  I ordered the salmon. It came with white rice. The rice was hard af. Unedible. Comparable to the rice at the bottom of a cooker that u don't scoop because you know it is blown. I can't believe the chef even plated it. You can tell, visually without even trying it, that it wasn't good. I told the server. He seemed nervous and unsure of himself most of the night. Service should be stellar especially if a restaurant is most empty. They comped my one double vodka which is cool, but I was hungry. :( Salmon was decent, but I have made and had better. I'd expect a whole lot more considering the price is high for what it is. My hubs ordered the ravioli. It was seriously enough for maybe a child. I believe this is why their bread basket has big soft pretzels in it. They try to fill you up with that because they know their proportions are off with taste quality low. I felt bad for him. The plate looked really sad and was over $30, I believe. I understand we could have ordered appetizers and would have if it wasn't for the fact the food was so meh. Even if the plate barely had any food, at least make it amazzzinngggg. Then the price would somewhat make sense.   Would we ever dine here again? No. Just not worth it. Sinatra, at the Encore, is sooooo much better. Also, this restaurant looks to be more popular day time. Wayyy busier. Tables are filled. (Can imagine bartender would be out of his mind.) They also have an outdoor dining area which overlooks the pool. I guess I would come back just to sit in the patio and bask in the ambiance? I guess that deserves 1 star.",

    "text": "This place is so good, we ate here 3 times in a 3 day stay at the Encore!  We went for breakfast smoothies.  We had a great lobster roll for lunch the following day.  Then we loved it so much we had to try their interpretation of chicken and waffles before we went home.  I love eating at restaurants that make you feel like they appreciate your business.  Las Vegas is a city where this should truly be the norm and not the exception, but Jardin goes the extra mile to make sure they ask you the questions you forget to think of to make your experience a great one.  I'm sure we will visit this restaurant at least once any time we stay at the Wynn or Encore in the future.  With so many dining options in Vegas, its comforting to know a restaurant that never disappoints!",

I saw each table sat after us get service from the waitstaff, except our table.  After about 30 minutes, I saw a hostess speak to a gentleman in a suit & point to our table.  The gentleman in the suit came to our table & stated he was sorry for the wait.  I said \" Yes, it felt like we were forgotten about.\"    I can't even make up what he said next, \" Well we have a small celebrity in the restaurant that is more important.\" He then realized what he said quickly & flustered to correct his statement.  Our food did not come out in a timely fashion, again seeing tables sat after us getting their food.  When the gentleman in the suit came to our table to bring food, I asked if he was the manager, & he stated he was. I then asked him who the celebrity was & he told me Ciara & where she was sitting. Wow, I was floored, he spilled the information without blinking an eye.  Needless to say, our lunch & experience was not worth the $30.00 price tag.  Sad to come from such a high end hotel like Encore.  I am a local & really wanted to enjoy this place.",

    "text": "Second time visiting and on this visit I had more time to really experience the menu and the food. You ever walk into a restaurant and realize theres nothing on the menu youd even both eating ie Public House at Venetian. Well here I wanted to order everything. The food reminds me of a step above Stack at Mirage and Beauty and Essex at Cosmo. The only saving grave Beauty and Essex has is the name, location and ambience.   Anyway, on to the food because the sevice, while present and cordial they dont really excel at making you feel at home. So, that leaves the food to carry this restaurant. I ordered the beet salad which was cute and dainty and really well seasoned and delicious.  At this point in restaurants everyone is going a beet salad and its kinda hard to screw it up. Im a sucker for fried chicken and honestly it was a toss up between that and the braised ribs with jalapeno grits. I went for the chicken because the menu just made it sound so delicious and it was probably some of the best sit down fried chicken ive had on the Strip. To top it off most entrees at Jardin come with sides and it feels like a whole menu.   Id go back for sure but i wish they had this menu as a quick service concept somewhere.   They lose a star because they served a moscow mule in a dinky little glass. For $16 they need to find copper mugs and sprigs of lavender. What a joke!",

I ordered the mixed berry parfait and three egg breakfast.  Nothing really tickled my taste buds, though the pieces of bacon I got with my plate were nice and crispy.  It took a long time for my entree to be brought out after my parfait, and service didn't really pick up until the end of our meal when our sever was around more and making conversation with us.  Tables looked like they were spaced apart, yet we could hear the conversion in the table next to us so not as far as they appeared.  Not sure I would come back again for a meal, though it is convenient if staying at Encore or doing some shopping there.",

This was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had in Las Vegas and as overpriced as I thought the meal was, I would eat there again because it was really delicious!.  I ordered Chicken omelet w English muffin w lots of avocado which was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Coffee was hot and tasty, but served with really cold cream which is never a good idea because it just kills the heat of the coffee. I enjoyed the fresh Pomegranate juice but DANG $14 a glass is crazy.  My husband had Steak and eggs and said the steak was perfectly cooked. Eggs super fluffy and we both really enjoyed the finely shred hash brown - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I'd go back just for those, lol.  Don't be put off by the small portions because the meals were actually quite filling.  Again, while everything was delicious it is way overpriced for the type of meal you get. The eatery options in Vegas are endless and you can get delicious food for much less (maybe not this good, but good enough)   World class customer service Meghan! Ambience was elegant but casual.",

Food: I should have read the fine print a/o asked questions. It was bottomless spaghetti, garlic bread and cesear salad but it was served with a marinara sauce rather than bolognese so admittedly, I was disappointed. The pasta was cooked al dente and my unrefined palate again, was unhappy. Jardin totally delivered on the meal, I just expected cheap spaghetti bolognese but was served a much nicer meal. We also ordered the Thai chicken wings which were very tasty and the green vegan pizza which was surprisingly good for vegan food.   Service: excellent! Our server was attentive and friendly. Dishes were delivered at reasonable times and our drinks were always filled. No crazy wait for a table when there a lot of empty tables. The hostess was so kind to ask us our input for a table and moved us closer to the pool. My experience here was so much better than Andrea's!  Price: reasonable given the excellent service and food. It's not cheap but definitely worth it!  Location: it's located in the walkway between Encore and Wynn but closer to the E. Jardin is also located next to the pools so you could sit outside and enjoy the lovely atmosphere of greenery and water. We did and it was beautiful.   Overall, I'd go back to Jardin and recommend it!",

So, you get charged for an actual lobster part and an omelette separately which came out to be $42 - not worth it. So, word to the wise don't get creative.

The wait staff and kitchen are slow. Food was tasty but very overpriced. 120 dollars for breakfast for 2. No alchohol? Calm down. I had the same breakfast over at cesars from a restaurant with a star chef for half the price.",

Each day we have been sat and waited 10 min to be greeted by our waitress. Then when the food is dropped off by the cook or someone from the kitchen. We haven't had the waitress come back by and ask about our food how it is anything else you need? To me it's 3 stars based on the service. It's part of our package is why we keep eating here we get a $50 credit here each day.",

My family and I came in for dinner one evening and we were all impressed with the quality of this restaurant.  They offer these warm delicious pretzel bread sticks and regular crunchy sticks to start off with. For dinner, I had the salmon and it was probably the best salmon I ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.   I decided to try a dessert and went for the chocolate flower pot. It was HUGE!!! It actually looked like a flower pot and it was rich and chocolaty without being overly sweet. It was way too much for one person to eat.   I would definitely recommend coming here if you are looking for a fabulous dinner with beautiful views and excellent service.",

Service was quick, food was hot, and they kept our coffee and water refilled. Dinner was okay, the food was excellent but the ambiance was just \"off\".

Most of the people were seated outside (which there was a 25-30 min wait for), so we chose to sit inside, in which they offered us a window seat. The staff was very nice and we were seated pretty much right away for our 3:30 reservation. Bailey was our waitress and she was amazing!  Gf and I both ordered the sangria (which was sooooo good and refreshing). Upon getting the drink however, it had blueberries in it (which I'm a allergic to, and they replaced it with no hassle.   For lunch, I ordered the jardin burger, which was excellent. Juicy, with the porkbelly on top with the aoli sauce. Just perfect, and a side of fries. My gf got the margarita pizza, which was good as well.   Overall this place has a vibe that combines the elegance of a Sunday brunch with the cool & chill atmosphere. Would definitely come back. The floral center decoration in the middle of the restaurant just brings it all together.",

They were well staffed, and not too busy maybe 4 other tables in there with us. The restaurant itself is huge! Counting the large outside seating area.           SEATING/AMBIANCE:We were seated right away and noticed immediately the ambiance was incredible! We started by trying a couple of their Mule Cocktails as there was a beverage cart making them table side which was neat. The Mule's were average, nothing spectacular. Then after a time our server greeted us after having had our drink order taken and our cocktails made at the beverage cart and asked if we were ready to order which we were. We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken entree and the Beef Short Rib Ravioli along with a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and a side of Vegetables.            THE FOOD was served promptly which is always nice! The presentation of each and every course was immaculate (which it should be for the prices and being a fine dining establishment). The food itself however was underwhelming and we were rather disappointed in the quality of flavor or lack thereof. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was really just Okay along with the almost flavorless Mashed potatoes. The vegetables didn't have much flavor and were somewhat watery. The Buttermilk Chicken was average for fried chicken, probably the best thing was the Beef Short Rib Ravioli which even then I would say was just \"Good\" the best thing about it was it's unique sauce with nice flavor. The portions of course were very small (even for fine dining) and expensive. Need to deliver more then beautiful presentation and ambiance, especially in Vegas were fine restaurants are a dime a dozen.         THE SERVICE: We maybe saw our server twice and only for a moment each time once to take order and again to deliver bill all other contact was with the the Food Delivery person or Beverage cart attendant. Overall we spent $140 for dinner and didn't bother for dessert because of the underwhelming experience up until then.  The Gelato place around the corner was great though!",

A side of pancakes being brought out once everyone's done eating, despite the two inquisitions previously made at the arrival of the rest of the dishes.. not acceptable, and not worth coming back.

However, it went downhill completely after that. It took over an hour for us to receive our food. We ordered a meat sauce for one of the spaghettis, however the cooks brought out a plate of meat instead. They also forgot to bring out a mac and cheese we ordered. The menu doesn't tell you all the information; for example multiple people in our party ordered mac and cheese without being told it was cauliflower mac and cheese. One persons burger was completely pink inside after, my garlic bread was completely burnt. I do appreciate them taking off the burger on the bill, and the late mac and cheese. We also received two free desserts. I'm still giving Jardin only one star, because of the poor experience on our prom night, making us late to our prom as we were there for about two hours. We were only a party of 6, and the place was empty. There is no reason that our food took as long as it did.",

This is an American restaurant that triples their prices because it's in the Wynn... Duhhhh obvi. I was looking at their menu for a price range and it was your basic 10$ for vegetables, 30$ for a few pieces of shrimp ETC... So not that bad.  We tried the cheese and meat plate, and kale salad for appetizer. Then for dinner: baked chicken on green beans, tomato cheese rice, steak for entrees. We also got ONE free Moscow mule. No dessert unfortunately. Everything was delicious and made with superb quality. Everything didn't wow me but it was delicious and piping hot!   Our server wasn't very friendly though, she acted like we were a burden because we were a comped table... Does she not know us industry people tip out extremely well? She even tried to charge us for a drink we didn't order thinking it was a mixed drink because the restaurant ran out of copper mugs.",

We had Wayne as our waiter and he made sure everything was to our liking the entire night. We never felt rushed and our drinks were always full. For the appetizer we ordered the meatballs which were really good. For our entree, I ordered the short ribs with a size of the truffle Mac & cheese bites and my husband ordered the prime rib. Everything was very tasty,especially the mac  &cheese bites. They were so rich I loved them! For dessert we had to try the flower pot cake which was perfect. The balance of sweetness between the chocolate mousse layers with the chocolate and raspberry filling was perfection. We would definitely come back here to try their other menu options for brunch/lunch! Great experience overall.",

Three of us came here for dinner and overall the experience was quite good.  Service was very attentive and professional, very well trained staff.  Our table was actually near the outdoor garden so the view was pleasant too.  The only downside was I was i advertently given an old menu and what I wanted was not available, and I really wanted it!  Oh well.  I was quickly given a new menu and the choices were far less, so I ended up with a compromise, Branzino.   The fish was well prepared with a puree of potato and some veggies, all quite good.  One dinner companion wanted a small salad and they accommodated it nicely and without any fuss.  Overall the experience was good enough and a nice choice in the Casino/Hotel and away from the crowds.  And the price wasn't that bad either.",

Then to finish off we had the edible flower pot. I thought it was going to probably be dry since the outer layer was a little hard to cut into but boy was I wrong. The inside was a super rich and moist chocolate cake with chocolate mouse. The outer layer ended up being super good too as it was just a chocolate mold.

I know poaching eggs is an art, however, at this calibur of restaurant there is no excuse for improperly poaching an egg. Honestly for the prices at this restaurant I would not recommend anyone to go here. I do not mind spending $30 on a nice properly prepared brunch for myself. I do mind spending that much when the food is not prepared properly.",

I ordered from their pre fixed menu since the choices were exactly what I would have wanted to order on their al a carte menu. My appetizer was a crab cake, entree filet mignon cooked perfectly to my specifications. It also included a choice of 2 desserts.  We were there to see Le Reve and didn't mention it to our server until we ordered dessert. He was able to request the kitchen to rush it since we only had 20 minutes to our show time.  My dessert was a warm berry crostada that was cooked to order. It was amazing.   I wish I had more time to relax and eat the whole thing but it was our fault for not letting the server know earlier of our time constraint.  Definitely go to this restaurant. Our server was amazing (I wish I remembered his name) along with all the other wait staff that was servicing our table.  We sat by the window overlooking the pretty pool area.",

The restaurant is beautiful, surrounded with Windows and adorned with fresh colorful flowers. Unfortunately, the tables are very close to each other and it was annoying to hear the conversations of people next to us, literally 18 inches away. As for the food, I expected something similar to Terrace Pointe, typical Vegas cafe, nothing exotic, but reliable fresh delicious food. I was disappointed. First of all, it's a very limited menu. We came here around 2 on a Friday after checking in and before hitting the Encore pool. Half of the menu was breakfast, with only a few salad and sandwich choices. I went with the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. The salad came soaked in dressing, it was very soggy and iced cold as if it was sitting in a fridge before they doused it with dressing. Also, for an extra $7 I expected grilled chicken, this was cubed pieced of semi frozen chicken, similar to what you'd find in a bag at the supermarket. I understand that Caesar is made with anchovies but the fishy taste was overpowering. I ended up sending it back and the waiter apologized and offered me something else. I was turned off and no longer hungry so I passed. My husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich which he liked, I tasted it and it was pretty good. I  recommend walking over to Terrace Pointe at the Wynn if you're looking for a cafe, skip Jardin.",

We had to flag our waitress down for everything...from trying to order wine, appetizers, dinner, waitng for the food to arrive, the check...well, you get the idea.  We even had to take our check up to the hostess stand to pay because our waitress was MIA.  And when she did come by (after we would flag her down), it was an effort for her to help us.  Then the food itself......I'll leave it at, we got sick on the crab appetizer....literally sick.  I LOVED the space when it was Botero and hoped it would be similar....terrible disappointed.

    "text": "Jardin was highly recommended by the concierge at Mandarin Oriental due to Steve Wynn (owner of Encore and Wynn Hotels in Las Vegas) making sure there are vegan options in his restaurants.  Ambiance in Jardin is lovely, light, and bright with white decor and indoor and outdoor seating available.  The room was uncomfortably warm due to the door to the outside seating being located within 30 feet of where we were sitting.  The highlight for me was the vegan entree of Mushroom Dashi, a beautiful bowl of baked tofu in broth with  baby bokchoy, mushrooms, and rice noodles.    It was delicious and creative.  Unfortunately, the non-vegan entrees left a lot to be desired.  The pork chop was a large portion and a good cut, but it lacked flavor and the sauce was uninspiring.  The salmon was dry and inedible.  The waiter removed it from the table without even asking why the diner left almost the entire fish on the plate.  The most disappointing aspect of the dinner was the service.  From waiter to the waiter's assistants, the staff cultivated a stiff and pretentious demeanor that was off putting.  With all the delicious restaurant options available in Las Vegas, we would not try Jardin again.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here after a long walk on the Strip. First of all, the ambience is so relaxed and and colorful with the surrounding elegant flowers and pool setting outside. We had the following:  Grandma's Chicken Meatballs $14  Chopped Kale Salad $14  Sea Scallop Cioppino $29  Hot Pot $20  Biegnets with Raspberry Sauce $10  The chicken meatballs were absolutely divine! They were probably the best chicken meatballs or maybe meatballs in general i've ever tasted. They were tender but still had a good texture and the tomato sauce and ricotta cheese helped the dish add more flavors. The kale salad was good. Next time though i would ask for the dressing on the side bc it was dressed pretty well. I liked the apple slices in it which made it refreshing. My cioppino tasted good but I thought it was too small of a portion for $29 and the scallops were of the small variety. My wife's hot pot consisted of kurobota pork, kimchee fried rice, and a fried egg. I thought it was good but not worth $20. The dessert was fantastic! The beignets were surprisingly light and airy with the acidic raspberry sauce to balance it. The service was great. Our waiter described to us in detail about the menu. FYI, the menu does include an allergen guide which shows how customer focused this resto is. I give it 4/5 stars bc the ambience and service were great and the food tasted pretty good. The chicken meatballs and beignets were 10/10 on execution and taste.",

    "text": "So for being in one of my favorite hotels the experience my friends and I had at this restaurant was horrendous. So lets start off with our reservations. We were a large party and had a reservation on Saturday night at 8:30 for 11 of us. They told us that if we were late or did not show up we would be incurred a charge of $50 dollars per person. We got there early and were not even seated until at least 45minutes past our reservation time.  We inquired about the wait twice, the first time we were told that they were still waiting for one of the tables to leave.  The second time they told us that they were going to relocate the current table to another table.  Once we got inside I was a little confused because the restaurant was not busy.  It wasn't even half full so I don't understand why it took so long for us to get seated.  Then, we finally get seated and the waiter takes our drink orders.  They had a moscow mule cart and about half of us ordered one.  It was delicious and we all enjoyed it.  It was also really cute and a good way for us to get our drinks right at the table.    About fifteen minutes later we noticed that the tables around us all had warm pretzels/bread sticks.  We had to flag down a busser to inquire about it and they were the ones that brought some out to us.  That was strange, I thought the waiter was supposed to do that.  One of us ordered a soup and salad at their dinner, the salad arrived about 30 minutes after ordering.  However, it was over and hour later by the time we all got our food.  When we did get our food we received two salmon steaks that were completely raw in the center and a steak that was ordered medium well but came out raw.  The rest of the food was pretty good.  I had the fried chicken but my side dishes were cold.  I did not want to send my food back because I was so hungry and did not want to wait another hour before getting my food.  The other half of us that got hot food, really enjoyed their meal.  However, I was so hungry that I got full waiting for my food.  I hate blaming the server because he does not control the kitchen.  He was actually pretty nice and accommodating.  Meanwhile there was a table near us who arrived at least thirty minutes after us, they got their food before we did.  I think that this was the longest dinner that I have ever had.  We were so tired and over it by the time dinner was over.  Finally, we pay our bill and after we get our change/cards back we ask to speak to the manager. We were being polite and told him what happened. That was a waste of time because all that he said was, \"Thanks for the feedback\" and walked away.  That was completely rude and he did not care one bit.  I do not think that I will  return to this restaurant.  This is pretty high on my list for some of the worst service I've ever had.",

The food was okay and the dessert very cute. The overall theme and decor is nice. The service was slow and I we had to repeat ourselves a few times on different items. We had 3 servers during our stay which was odd(didn't feel a personal touch). My friends loved the drink cart as a nice touch. I would like to come back for breakfast or brunch but I'm not fond of the slow service. SMH",

    "text": "My fiance and I went to Jardin for a mid-afternoon bite to eat. The restaurant was pretty much empty. We ordered a BOY Burger and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. After waiting for our food for 30 minutes, we asked what was taking so long. The waitress replied that it takes 20 minutes to cook a burger (okay, then why is it not ready after 20?). We waited 40 minutes for the food to finally arrive. The soup came in parts: a few shredded pieces of dried out chicken and exactly 4 small pieces of dried pasta. The waitress then proceeded to pour broth from a teapot into the chicken to hydrate it, I guess. The presentation was unique but the taste was awful. The soup had absolutely no flavor at all! I put a lot of salt into it and it still lacked flavor. This was not even chicken broth. It tasted and looked like beef broth or the au jus that comes with a french dip sandwich(but even that would have had more flavor). I complained about the lack of taste to the waitress and she said that the manager would come over to speak us. For a restaurant that is very highly priced in a very upscale hotel with a chef's name attached, I'd expect that they could handle a bowl of chicken noodle soup. The manager said she would take the price of the soup off our bill ($10). That was fine but not the point. When our bill did arrive we were charged $36 for a burger and an ice tea. The price of the burger on the menu was $16 but on our bill it was charged as $29! When I asked about this the waitress said she would take it to the manager. She came back with a lowered bill and stated that the manager took off the ice tea. This still did not explain the $29 charge for a $16 burger. We were so frustrated with poor service and lousy food we just paid the bill. On the way out, I asked to see the menu one more time to see if there was something I missed, the young ladies at the front desk were very rude. When I questioned why the burger had an extra $13 on it they said that it was for the toppings and fries (really, cheese?!). I asked why it didn't say that on the menu. She stated the restaurant had just opened and they needed to work out some kinks on the menu. With all of the outstanding choices of places to eat at the Wynn and in Vegas in general, why would anyone want to waste their money on this place. Awful, don't waste your time, taste buds, or money!",

And resulting in my would be 4 stars down to 2 stars.   By far the worst pasta I have ever had at a restaurant of this level. The lobster portion was good and prepared decently, however the hot heat and Pernod sauce was way heavy and made the noodles overdone - very mushy.

    "text": "During our most recent visit to Encore we had dinner on our first night at Jardin, and boy were we pleased...  The meal began with a bread basket of pretzel bread sticks with a peppercorn butter spread. Usually u say \"ugh\" when pretzel bread comes out since most places I've had it serves cold, tough bland pretzel bread which wastes precious appetite reserved for the appetizers and entrees that I am there for.  I decided to try a bit more out of curiosity for the taste of the peppercorn butter spread.  I was VERY surprised to bite into a hot soft delicious breadstick with just the right amount of salt which the peppercorn spread complemented beautifully.  I have never spent more than an passing comment about a bread service, but I felt that I needed to share my delightful surprise...  Moving along...  in our group of four people, we ordered both appetizer and main dinner courses.  Appetizers included the Roasted Tomato Soup about which the two in my party who had it raved.  My wife and I split and Caesar Salad which was very fresh and crisp, dressed perfectly with just the right amount of dressing and Grana Padano cheese. Delicious!  For our entrees my wife and I split the Short Rib Ravioli and the Bigeye Tuna Poke.  Short Rib Ravioli consisted of delicious braised short rib meat stuffed in pillows of fresh pasta to form the ravioli.  Parmesan cream sauce with port glaze to add some nice flavor perfected the dish.  If you love, like or can tolerate short ribs and enjoy a rich (but not overwhelming) cream sauce, you will LOVE this dish (hopefully) as much as I did!!!    The Tuna Poke was very nice and fresh and balanced. My only suggestion to improve it to my taste would be to add more avocado. Something about sashimi grade Tuna diced with avocado chunks is a match made in culinary heaven.  Just my opinion though... if you don't dislike avocado you won't mind it.    One other of our party ordered the Lobster Capellini and said that it was very good. He finished the dish and he is not one to do so unless it is something he truly enjoyed...  Service was very attentive and professional.  Not one complaint or neutral/negative comment to be found.  The decor was beautiful and featured an immense floral arrangement in the center of the restaurant which brightened up the entire space.  Just gorgeous!",

The vegan mushroom tartine was very nice. The almond cheese was creamy and cheesy yet not heavy at all. They both paired nicely with our drinks. Venue looked great. Overall nice experience",

    "text": "I wanted a casual dining experience while at Encore or Wynn and was debating between Jardin and Tableau. But once I saw photos of the Maine Lobster Benedict, I knew I had to go to Jardin.   It's located in the beginning of the Encore Esplanade, right across from Hermes. It's a beautiful restaurant with tons of colorful flowers. If you sit outside, you overlook the pool area.   I don't like ending conversations on a negative note so I'm not doing that with this review. The food was marvelous and I'll get into that soon. But the service was very lacking which was surprising to me for a luxury resort hotel. I had had wonderful service so far during my stay that I was disheartened to experience less than great service from Jardin. I was told afterward from my husband that he had made a special request TWICE (from the hostess who sat us down and to the maitre'd himself) for our anniversary. Unfortunately, that request was never fulfilled and even when he had approached them afterward, they did not make any offer of amends.   We had three different servers. One had been moved indoors and so we had a second server. Then it got too cold outside and once we were moved inside, we had our third server. Of the three, our second server, Megan, was the most attentive. We were not checked on often by any of the other two which was a sad shame.   But on a better note, our lunch was fabulous. I ordered the avocado toast as an appetizer and it seems pricey at $16 but it comes with three triangular toasts that are heaped on with fresh avocado, black garlic humus, pomegranate seeds, lettuce and grape tomatoes. It was delicious.   We both ordered the Maine Lobster Benedict and it was the best Benedict I've ever had. $24 but very much worth it in my opinion. Two English muffins with large pieces of lobster on each and an excellently poached egg on top of each. In the middle was a rectangular hash brown that was a great compliment to the dish. It was very crispy and buttery. I loved this dish and highly recommend it if you're able to have lobster and don't mind the higher price.   I also had the Orange Lavender Mule which was delicious! Loved it so much, Megan gave me the recipe from the bar.  It was so refreshing and delightful. I also had an English breakfast with milk. They serve Forte teas on the Wynn property which is nice.   Overall, the food we had was marvelous. Maybe we just had sheer bad luck with regards to the service during this visit and hopefully it'll improve. If you want Maine Lobster for breakfast though, come here.",

    "text": "Fun little spot in the connection hallway between Wynn and Encore.  This Garden was beautiful.  Flowers everywhere, beautiful art and just an all around great place to sit an enjoy Brunch.  Some of their menu options were very creative like my Chicken & \"Waffles\" which was a French toast with a hole cut in the middle and egg fried inside with some buttermilk fried chicken placed on top and maple syrup.  Some options were not very creative like the fried chicken sandwich which was literally that.  Fried chicken breast in between two pieces of bread with some slaw.  Not sure what my friends expected but they were definitely jealous when they saw my dish.  We had some sweet potato fries with the chicken sandwiches and they were waffle cut and very delicious.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Honestly I'd give this place 5 stars but I feel the menu was slightly lack luster (maybe needs a bit more options) and also the cost for what you get seemed a bit out of whack.  This place is very pricey.  I know I rated this 4 stars, but I'd probably not choose to come here again.",

Our waiter made excellent recommendations, checked up on us  properly and our water glasses were never empty. I wish I had gotten our waiter's name because I would request him every time. We also did not come in with a reservation. My friend and I had missed a reservation at Tableau and wandered looking for a new place (so glad we missed Tableau because in comparison to Jardin, eating at Tableau is like eating at Denny's). We were seated promptly. We did feel slightly weird as many patrons are dressed too nicely for a \"casual\" restaurant but the staff did not seem to care that we were underdressed.  We got three appetizers to share since my friend and I found those most appealing. Before our food came out, we were served complementary pretzel sticks with honey mustard whip. Let me tell you, these were some of the best pretzels I've ever had. We ordered the smoked octopus, buffalo cauliflower and strip steak carpaccio. The smoked octopus was my favorite! It's served with chorizo and a garlic aioli. The octopus is so tender that it cuts with a fork. I would come back for this dish alone! Next, buffalo cauliflower is a pretty standard dish. Jardin did it so well, the cauliflower was cooked just perfectly and the breading was light and crisp. Lastly, the beef carpaccio was sliced thinner than paper! Overall the food was so fabulous that my friend and I were almost in tears (yes we cry over food lol).   I cannot recommend Jardin enough! Food was amazing, service was amazing, decor is amazing! I can't wait to come back to try their flower pot dessert. Yuuuuum.",

Everything is else is lackluster.   The service isn't good. They all look like they'd rather be somewhere else. Our busser was more attentive than our waiter. He never delivered the dishes or checked on our food but he popped up every 30 seconds to pick up the signed check. For these prices you would think they would bring it with either service or food but the food was pretty average too. It reminds me of a high end cafe. I had a three course meal and there isn't one thing that stood out. The beet salad was blah and our apple crostata came with no ice cream and was so thick all you tasted was dough. When you're not delicate or rush pastry, it shows. I think the most disappointing part of our meal was having to eat around cigarette smokers on nearby tables (using the restaurant cups for ashtrays). It's gross having someone blow smoke when you're trying to take a bite and I don't know if it was allowed but no staff said anything and they were very aware of it. Judging by the loud EDM music, I think they are trying to cater to a younger, club crowd. Awkward for families and a romantic date.",

    "text": "Just another nice restaurants to in the Wynn. Seriously, each restaurant at the Wynn has very similar fare for a very similar price, at least when it comes to lunch, and never does it disappoint. Each meal will run from $15-$25 on average and is very filling. Service is always on point and most places have outdoor seating available, perfect for a spring day.   I had the chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato waffle fries. The chicken sandwich was exceptionally cooked, perfectly paired with some creamy slaw. The waffle fries were good but not great. I wish the sandwich came with a side instead of having to order the fries a la cartel but it is what it is. I highly recommend the sandwich if you come to Jardin. The salad, especially with added salmon, also looked very good from what I saw at tables around me.   Overall I liked my meal here and would recommend it for atmosphere alone if you get an outdoor seating area. My one huge complaint is the reservation process. I first tried OpenTable and it said they were booked from 10am-2pm. I then called Wynn reservations and same thing. As I showed up at noon, I found that the place was only about a third full. I just don't get how there were no reservations available if it was two thirds open at the restaurant. Jardin needs to fix this issue as I want people to give it a try and not get nervous about having a wait or not getting a table at all.",

This would be the place I would love to sit by the window seat with pool view enjoy a bottle of wine, we had a bottle of sauvignon blanc it was great parking with our seafood. The presentation it's beautiful, and my favorite it's the tuna tar tar, I can taste the pear mixed with the tuna definitely give you that crisp, freshness, and the pine nut gives you that flavor so you don't feel like the tuna tar tar with the sauce as usual.   The ambiance it's beautiful, very classy, you better be a lil dressy walking in there, and the service is great! Definitely enjoyed my time there, you gotta make reservation get a table sit in the restaurant have the full experience other than the bar area.",

The restaurant is gorgeous and beautiful lighting  They have American, style food with a soul food vibe. They have the most amazing chicken noodle soup.  We also ordered their meatballs and they were so good! Better than your grandmothers  the steak here is super good too! They have these truffle fries and they are too die for!! Basically all of their food is delicious   There's shops and shows near by so it's perfect for a drink and some food while shopping or right before or after a show!!",

    "text": "This was our last meal in Vegas. We had a 3:00 flight so we hit up Jardin for lunch since it was in our hotel. What attracted us to Jardin was that it was upscale casual with a nice mix of breakfast, brunch, and lunch items. You'll see items such as smoothies, granola bowls, plays on eggs benedict, burgers, salads, etc.   The restaurant has a composed, classy vibe. I didn't see any 25 year old groups downing mimosas, nor did I see many families with kids.   The service was strong and the food was good. Zero drama. Precisely what you want after a night out on a Sunday morning before taking a flight back home to reality. Their burger here leans more to the classic side but is a strong offering. I was very satisfied. The steak served with my wife's steak salad was surprisingly tender and delicious, must have been a prime sirloin or something. Our antioxidant smoothie and coffee drinks were great as suspected.  4.5 stars. Nothing here will blow your socks off but the service and food will meet or slightly exceed your expectations.",

    "text": "Based on the beautiful setting great fresh food and over all experience Jardin earns five stars although at our particular sitting there was one service faux pas.   We had one prix fixe dinner (sans alcohol) consisting of the tuna tartare appetizer, Branzino roasted fish and dessert tart sampler.  Also we ordered the beet salad and salmon entree.   All dishes were excellent. Each dish had some unique memorable aspect to it, such as a special accompaniment that was not overly showy but brought out the real flavor of the main food.   The tuna tartare (with pieces of pear in it) was a good sized portion and among the best tuna tartares that we've had. The pear really added something.   The beet salad included blue cheese (I'm not a fan - she is) and very delicious shaved radish - nice pairing. The Branzino was flaky and flavorful and paired with shaved fennel which really provided a great side taste to the dish. The salmon was nicely accompanied with shaved and half pieces of carrot.  The salmon was actually on the raw side almost - many would not have cared for its translucent undercooked appearance - but I don't mind salmon that way and its honey glaze somehow made it taste fine and not undercooked.   The pastries included mousse, a very rich chocolate cake, macaroon, and a coconut dipped chocolate ball. (Even liked the macaroon and I don't usually care for macaroons but it had a very good filling.) It was my birthday so they included an edible thin white chocolate Happy BDay and lit candle, and wished me HB! in two different languages. (It wasn't the showy out loud birthday song - just a classy private wish from the server who brought the dessert.)  Service was great - very unobtrusive but one issue was that we ordered a bottle of Pellegrino and a hot jasmine green tea but the water didn't show up until mid way through the salad (and not at all for the appetizer) so we (or more especially I because the tea was hers) were sitting there p-p-parched for a third of the meal reflex grabbing at an empty water glass to the point where I was about to self service a metal pitcher of ice water from the serving station that was behind our table. (By the way our indoor table was phenomenally set right alongside the pool but, looking back I'd have preferred one that wasn't sandwiched between two server stations - you ended up having some server hover behind you at his or her station during much of the meal -reminded me of Sonny Bunz hanging like a vulture around Tommy's neck in Goodfellas.)  Very late on the drinking water aside, the entire experience was very memorable.  All the food was fresh and uniquely tasty.  Would recommend.",

Smacked me in the face, screaming \"where have you beeeeen all my life?\" It was super tasty, the lobster was fantastic.  My husband got the chicken omelette, he enjoyed it. Ate every last bit. My mom got the kale scramble and it looked AMAZING. She ate it all, savored every last bite!  My dad got the apple stuffed French toast! He super loved that!!  We got the pecan topped cinnamon roll to start for the whole table it was perfect shareable amount!   My mom got a Bloody Mary and I got the Pink Sangria, then we got a couple more Pink Sangria's....they were DELISH.   We REALLY wanted to get the chocolate mousse in a FLOWER POT. Yes. A FLOWER POT! & it's 100% edible. Every part of it, unfortunately by the end of our breakfast we were far too full to order it. So that will definitely be on the next trip out here for sure.",

The breakfast options are strongest course here. The pancakes in particular were huge. The avocado toast was a popular order among food options as well.   Most dishes for breakfast ran $10-20. They have lighter fare like parfaits and oatmeal if you want something lighter.   Service was excellent each time as well. Many thanks to Dan to taking great care of a weary group of travelers!",

Seemed as though we always had to track someone down when we needed a refill or a box or the check! We were invited here to review the restaurant as well, and on a service stand point, our server was not excelling. I mean I'm talking about 7 minutes just to be greeted (I timed it)   Enough about the service!! The darn pancakes were so fluffy and dense simultaneously that it caused a reaction in my mouth. That reaction was continuous salivation. So great I'd definitely come back when I'm feeling brunchy!   Omelette was amazing too! Price point is a little pricey but worth it! They make up for it in portion size and taste quality! Not to mention the decor is gorgeous",

Jardin is somewhere where I wish I could dine on a daily basis.   While on vacation in Vegas, I often dine here when I am staying at the Wynn properties hotel. At my most recent stay I came here for breakfast. Didn't order anything complicated, a iced vanilla latte to start. And my breakfast was 3 eggs with potatoes, bacon and some toast on the side. As simple and basic as my meal was, it was absolutely delicious because everything was done so well. Probably the best iced vanilla latte I have ever had. The quality off the eggs were organic and were perfectly cooked sunny side up. The bacon I asked to be cooked crispy, and it was. Hot and crispy which is so rare when you go to so many breakfast places. The potatoes were great too, mixed variety of sweet and regular. And great bread offered with delicious jams and spreads.   The service staff was friendly, the decor is beautiful, and the food is high quality and tastes delicious. What more could you ask for?",

Turns out every Wynn restaurant has a vegan/vegetarian menu which explains why I was at the Wynn almost every day.   Anyways, I had the veggie pizza in the \"socializing\" part of the menu (fancy way of saying \"appetizer\" I guess), and my god it was good. The vegan ricotta was very light and fluffy. It didn't really taste like cheese but who am I to say? I haven't had cheese for like 8 years. Toppings were generous and they all paired together nicely. I finished about 34 of it and took the rest back to the hotel to eat later. If you're vegan, I highly recommend the pizza! Even my brother (who is a strict carnivore) enjoyed it!",

For appetizers we had the meatballs, fried cauliflower, oysters and beef carpaccio. I loved the beef carpaccio. It was delicious and smokey with the cheese on top. I also loved the oysters. They were on the smaller side and it comes with lemon and a garlic olive oil sauce. They were fresh and delicious.   For the entree I got the filet mignon medium rare. I also got a chance to try the ribeye, and sea bass. For the meats you had he option of adding on a side of shrimp scampi or lobster tail. My friend got the lobster but I ate most of it. The lobster with the butter sauce was very good. A little over cooked because the ends were dry and chewy. My filet was perfect. It was a perfect medium rare throughout. It was super lean but very very tender. It was juicy and flavorful. I absolutely loved it. The filet came with broccolini on the side.   Usually the ribeye is my favorite cut of steak because of the marbling but I tried my friends ribeye and I definitely liked my filet better. It was a little chewy I felt that the cut was fatty but the fat wasn't well distributed. It was still good but the filet is better quality.   We didn't get a chance to try dessert because we were so full but I definitely want to try their flower pot chocolate cake. Our bill was extremely hefty for the wine and food. But service was excellent and food was delicious.",

I love dining out at restaurants that can offer both a stunning ambience and vegetarian options that branch out beyond pasta dishes (*le sigh*).   Given that, I'm super impressed by Jardin. We came late on a Wednesday night to celebrate a birthday. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive. He made us smile since he also surprised us with a complimentary flower pot dessert that I still have not stopped showing pictures of to my friends when they ask how the trip was. I can't believe how realistic they can make it look all while ensuring it's completely edible (and delicious, mind you).   As for the actual dishes, we split the buffalo cauliflower (with vegan blue cheese) and I ordered the mushroom steak. I seriously want to travel back to Vegas just to enjoy this entree again. I wasn't in the mood for anything fried, so the chef slightly modified this to err more on the baked side. My boyfriend's hot pot wasn't his favorite, but he still enjoyed it overall. They also deliver complimentary pretzel bread to the table along with homemade mustard spread. I usually can't stand mustard, but appreciated this pairing.   Coming here is a good life choice. You won't regret it as you look out onto the gardens and enjoy the larger-than-life floral centerpiece while enjoying unique cuisine.",

Great for dietary restrictions (vegetarians/vegans). I couldn't eat dairy due to a stomach problem that day, so they quickly made adjustments like replacing the hash browns for roasted potatoes, and butter for vegan butter.   The food: - Chicken omelette with egg whites + avocado: very healthy and not overly oily, great for recovering from a long night. Hefty portion of avocado. Came with perfectly toasty/crispy roasted potatoes that weren't drenched in oil, and your choice of sliced toast.   TLDR: if you've got a minute and want quality brunch, would definitely recommend this joint.",

The staff was friendly & professional, but still had a pulse (haha), being an upper scale restaurant, minus the white table clothes, which I didn't mind at all.      The round room with gold accents, mirrored pillars, fresh flowers & green plants makes for an extremely elegant and relaxing evening. Simple yet sophisticated... a perfect balance.      The food items ordered were nothing short of fabulous. A fresh Bronzino & a seafood lobster pasta. Let me tell you, I'm not a fan of pasta whatsoever - I never order it, but this pasta had me thinking about it the next day! Perfect preparation & presentation on both entrees.      It being my birthday, I just had to order their signature special dessert, completely edible, flower pot. I have never been defeated by a dessert- that is unable to finish it, this had me waving the white flag and it was DELISH to boot. I can't put into words what a wonderful evening I had here on my birthday- I guess it just translates to wonderful timeless memories made, so thank you for the fabulous birthday evening!",

Rushmore, but was still very enjoyable as a dinner course. Somehow the fries ended up being the food highlight here for me.  Service was friendly. I didn't find any of it to be pretentious.

The patio is cute. Small with a good view of the pool but shaded well. However, service is lacking. It took forever for our server to greet us, yet she passed us multiple times. When she did greet us she wasn't friendly. She actually seemed really annoyed.   For lunch I ordered the turkey burger with no bun and added bacon and cheese. When it came out they left off the avocado. That wouldn't have been too bad except the turkey burger itself was over seasoned. Too much to the point where it tasted horrible. If I'm paying $15 for a sandwich (without a side) I expect it to taste good. The fries were decent but how can you screw up fries?   Total for a burger, turkey burger and fries our meal was about $40. Not a good price for the quality of food.   Overall not a great restaurant. I would recommend going elsewhere for good service and food.",

We were seated outside, it was a hot day. Absolutely enjoyed the view while our order was served. We ordered the impossible burger - vegetarian, no meat. The burger WOWd us! The patty tasted so meaty, it actually felt like eating meeting. I loved the concept of fried onions versus fresh onions. Added a nice crunch. What I really liked was the lettuce and tomato served on the side giving me an option to add as much or as little as needed. Fries were good, no additional comments. I ordered Earl Grey tea, I must say the best tea I had with the right flavors. The highlight, of course left for the last was the showstopper of Jardin - the edible flower cake. The presentation- impeccable, flawless. You actually feel its a flower pot. The taste - we were in heaven!!!! Fresh cool chocolate mousse blending with raspberry and the chocolate crunch of the pot in between bites. I must say - the BEST! At no point did I feel it had too much butter or too much sugar - just the right touch. I am so in love - must have...!!  P.S : advisable to reserve in advance.",

    "text": "Solid dinner spot. I enjoyed all the food we tried. We came here on a Friday around 8 pm and it was relatively empty but had a great time. It picked up as we were leaving. I heard their brunch is awesome too. We wanted outdoor seating and although it was cold, they put two heaters as close to the table as they could get them and gave me a shawl. We had nice views of the Encore pool and pretty soon I was nice and toasty.   Some items were pretty simple but pricey like spaghetti and sauce but I ate the leftovers cold the next day after the gym and it tasted good so that's my criteria for thinking the food is of good quality.    We got a bottle of prosecco, roasted tomato soup with croutons, cauliflower mac and cheese, and spaghetti. The spaghetti came with garlic bread and salad. The cauliflower mac and cheese was good and the tomato soup was yummy and comforting. Was it the best I've ever had? No but it still made for an enjoyable evening. We couldn't finish our bottle of prosecco so we were able to bring the remaining glasses back to our room. Service was great and we were happy.   Food isn't as pricey as I expected it to be for a Wynn restaurant. I was happy.",

We stopped in when we arrived for a healthy start to the trip and it was a great choice! I had a great cocktail, I can't remember the name but it had a lavender sugar rim and it was beautiful.   We were seated outside with a nice view of the little pool but there were two birds that were annoying AF and bothered me the entire time. (SIDE NOTE: I'm extremely afraid of birds) I asked them to try to shoo them away and they acted like it wasn't a big deal but they weren't little birds they were gigantic frickin pigeons. I wanted to be re-sat inside but they didn't have anymore availability. It was low key stressful and the reason why they are getting 4 stars.  My mom and I shared the buffalo cauliflower and the avocado quinoa salad. Excellent choices! Honestly, I order a lot of buffalo cauliflower and this was hands down the best I ever had. The avocado quinoa salad was really fresh and delicious, I really enjoyed it and it was a great healthy way to start off Vegas.   Food was really good, atmosphere with the birds not so much.",

I'd like to start out by saying the menu is what caught our attention and we wanted to try something new so we decided to have Sunday brunch. I will say the food was good Three of us had steak and eggs I had and I had the salmon appetizer which was not exceptional but good. Service is very slow our daughters burger was overcooked and we had to wait a solid 15 minutes till we got somebody to come around to give us water so that we could tell them the burger was overcooked but at that point most of us were already Finished with our food and she didn't want anything else. So they took the burger off of the bill but she ended up not eating.  My wife ordered an orange juice and didn't get it till halfway through the meal and we had to wait 15 to 20 minutes for our check and we didn't even find our server we had to call somebody else over to ask them to get our check for us and then we waited another 10 minutes and had to end up giving our credit card and check to yet another server because our server wasn't around.  We most likely will not visit again but like I said the food is decent.",

Since I am a pescatarian, breakfasts while on vacation can be lackluster and tend to be either a bagel with lox or eggs and toast.  At Jardin, we ordered the Maine Lobster Benedict and the Kale Scramble.  The Main Lobster Benedict was near perfection and just melted in my mouth. Highly recommended.  My husband enjoyed his Kale Scramble and it was flavorful and satisfying. I fully appreciate the restaurants at Wynn/Encore offering quite a few options for non-meat eaters.",

The second time for breakfast I ordered a different omelet - I think like veggie or ham/onion/cheese and thought it was much better.  Oj was freshly squeezed and delicious. Also had an iced coffee/latte and was pretty good too.   Service was good and the place was clean. They had crayons and a kids menu to keep my son entertained for a little bit and provided plastic ware for my son to use as well which was nice and thoughtful. Would recommend coming back here !",

We had a reservation and at first we were seated outside, it's quite cold and the heater were \" out of propane\" when we first asked to move inside they refused and said there were not tables available. After complaining again one of the other waiters outside took it upon himself to find us a table inside and make sure we were settled, big thank you to him(sorry I don't remember your name). After dinner my girlfriend told them it was my birthday and asked them to bring out something special and they brought out the same dessert that was free as part of our prefix with a candle. When my girlfriend asked for another one they charged it to the bill at $20. I think a free dessert is the least a restaurant can give on a $150 check for someones birthday.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch and drinks with my Mom during our stay at the Wynn. I had the grilled cheese with tomato soup, which was to die for!! I'm drooling thinking about it right now. The tomato soup was creamy and thick, tangy and delicious. The grilled cheese was done on sourdough. The cheese was perfectly melted and the bread nicely browned. So good.   The drinks were top notch. I had the Vanilla Rose cocktail first. It was nicely presented with a flower, and was the perfect balance of sweet and sour. I also had the red sangria, which was huge (like the size of my head) and pretty boozy. I was into it.   The restaurant is bright and beautiful too. The one thing I would note is the service isn't great. Our server was busy talking to other servers, and was pretty slow. It wasn't so bad that it ruined the lunch, but could definitely use some improvement.",

    "text": "When looking at The Wynn's restaurant offerings, Jardin looked SO up my alley. From their al fresco patio, beautiful decor usage of fresh flowers and healthy food options I was immediately sold.  Unfortunately my experience did not live up to the expectation. Unlike other Wynn restaurants the service was erratic -- we had to wait almost fifteen minutes to be greeted by a server and our orders came out incorrectly and with odd timing. A point for enthusiasm, however.  I got the Lobster Benedict which sounded impressive but in reality was not. The dish came out mostly cold and inconsistently cooked and the hash browns were hard as a rock. Due to myself being starving, I ate it anyways but I decided not to return during my week stay at the Wynn. There are many better options within walking distance!",

Jardin was one of the restaurant options that we chose so we dined here on a pre-fixe menu.  The restaurant is decorated with gorgeous fresh flowers (one of the things that the Wynn is known for) and the ambiance is intimate. There wasn't anything really to rave about the food except for yellow tartare, avocado salad and the pretzel sticks (all appetizers). I also liked the flower pot chocolate dessert that actually looked like a flower pot! We enjoyed the Moscow Mule cart a little bit too much, and they happily provided us to go cups for the excess cocktails we weren't able to finish at the table.  The service was friendly and attentive during our experience here. They were accommodating to our requests (to go cups, to go boxes, more napkins, etc.) and they didn't have any issues with how we wanted to share our entrees family style.  I would give give Jardin another chance and try their regular menu the next time I stay at the Wynn.",

First of all, it is one of the more 'casual' restaurants. Every restaurant in the Wynn and Encore is pretty classy, so be prepared for the higher prices that go along with the amazing decor and service.  The food here was creative, but the flavors were off-balance. The fried chicken and waffle was overly breaded and under-seasoned. I wanted to ask for cholula, but stopped myself since it was a $20 dish! The eggs benedict was on par with any other brunch restaurant. Their coffee tasted burned. They forgot our fries and our server had way too many tables. To be fair, it was super busy with long lines at the front all morning.  Sadly, I still haven't found a go-to breakfast/brunch spot in Las Vegas. Bouchon was also underwhelming, so maybe I should just stick to the Peppermill? That place is consistently good breakfast at all hours. Next time i'll pass on Jardin and prob do the Wynn buffet.",

Can't say enough about the good menu choices and execution- but the service is terrible! Huge downside!  Our server was friendly, but She was really bad at timing and attention. Ordered drinks and salad first, after a really long wait! We were done with our salads before our drinks ever came! She didn't ever come to check whether we wanted another throughout dinner, which we did. Again- the food is great! And the chefs are doing a great job! But in a resort of this price level we expected better service.  The steaks were very good- but don't expect your water glass to be refilled, or To  be able to order anything else from the bar!",

    "text": "If you want a less than stellar meal, a poolside hotel restaurant offers pretty good odds.  Jardin strives to beat those odds but, like most of the players in the casino, it falls short.    First, the good.  The space is quite lovely, with a tasteful floral motif.  We sat on the patio, and the heaters kept us comfy, even on a cool January day in Vegas.  The patio was even far enough from the pool to keep you from getting drenched by overly enthusiastic kids doing cannonballs.  But that's where the really good part ends.  My wife and I both ordered Eggs Benedict, and we agreed that we have had much better.  The eggs were perfectly cooked, but the hollandaise was skimpy and the English muffins were dry and a bit hard.  The hash browns were definitely second rate - sort of a brick of (riced?) potatoes that elevated creativity over flavor.  And by \"creativity,\" I mean I have never seen anything quite like it.  Also, while $20 is not totally outrageous for Eggs Benedict (especially at the Wynn/Encore), for that price couldn't they have put a little slice of orange or sprig of parsley on the plate to dress it up a bit?  It all seemed kind of sparse.  Our friends both ordered omelets.  I didn't see them projectile spitting their meal across the patio, but they weren't exactly raving about the dish either.  And both of them left their \"hash browns\" untouched.    Since this was to be my only meal for the day, I also ordered a bowl of the roasted tomato soup (my attempt to convert breakfast into brunch), which was just fine.  Good tomato flavor, and a touch of tasty garnish.  Our server was very pleasant, when she was visible.  Which was not often.  It took much too long from seating to taking our order, and from clearing the table to bringing the check.  Fortunately, our friends are exceptional conversationalists.  But as it turns out, the fact that they were staying at the Wynn was the only reason to eat at Jardin.  No, I didn't try the buttermilk chicken sandwich, or some of the other dishes that get good reviews here.  But if you want a better Eggs Benedict, go off-Strip to Hash House A-Go-Go, or Black Bear Diner, or really just about anywhere.",

My husband and I walked into the Wynn and were directed by their employees to check this place out if we wanted a delicious meal. When we walked in I was totally blown away by their overly dramatic floral arrangement in the center of their restaurant. It was so beautiful it took my breath away. We were seated at a beautiful table and our waitress did not rush us one bit or get frustrated at my indecisiveness. I ended up getting their Crispy Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich, and im so glad I did. My meal definitely did not disappoint. I especially love how they did not give me a huge portion and a big enough sandwhich that filled me up. Unfortunately, the portion size was just enough to leave satisfied but I didn't have any room for what looked like an amazing dessert. I can't really remember what my husband got but I do know we both cleaned out plates. They are a bit on the pricy side but we didn't mind as we definitely got more than what we paid for. Long story short, this place is a must visit if you are ever in the Wynn.",

I sat outside which had a garden feel that overlooked the pool. I ordered the Lobster Benedict. The presentation was beautiful, and the meal was decent. It came with a perfectly formed hash brown  right in the middle. I wouldn't say I was blown away by the meal, but I would definitely visit the restaurant again.

    "text": "Let me first state the positive about this lovely restaurant. The setting is beautiful. We were seated in the outdoor dining area and everything was lovely. The problem, however, is with the service. I appreciate that it was slow at 8 o'clock on a Friday morning. However it initially took some time for a server to greet us, maybe because we were seated outdoors. Once we were seated we ordered our breakfast. My husband ordered the steak and eggs and I ordered the salmon and capers with the bagel. The food was amazing. The salmon plate was delicious. The salmon tasted fresh and the accompaniment of the cucumber and tomatoes were wonderful. However, if The food hadn't been good there was no one around to tell. The servers were MIA for most of our breakfast. When I got up to find someone to give me a coffee cup , the manager was standing in the middle of the room on his cell phone texting. I literally stood in front of him and cleared my throat so he would stop texting and look up and talk to me. Now I can see if I was at Denny's, but this is in the middle of the Encore and I expected better service. When I told him I was looking for my server he told me that he sent her home because it was slow. That's great, but I still needed a coffee refill and some cream cheese. I hope this was a one time thing and I would be willing to give Jardin's another chance to impress me with their service like I was with the food.",

    "text": "Staying at the Encore and wanting to eat \"in house\" I spent some time looking over the reviews of my different options.  Jardin, overall, had good reviews, though there seemed to be a common thread of inattentive and slow service by wait staff.  I would be dining alone and had nothing else to do, so if dinner took too long, it wasn't going to effect me negatively.  I was greeted at the entrance by two smiling, pleasant hostesses and could be seated immediately: on the patio or inside.  After inquiring about the temperature out on the patio, and being assured it was comfortable and there were heat lamps, I chose to sit there.  It was breezy, and cool and I didn't feel much heat from the nearest heat lamp; glad I was wearing a long-sleeved blouse!    (The occasional waft of cigarette smoke from another patron or two seated on the patio was unpleasant, but not overwhelming.  The tables ARE close together and since I was dining alone, I could, without straining, overhear the conversations at the tables to my left and right--but had I been engaged in a conversation at my own table, those conversations probably wouldn't have even registered with me.  And being off-season, there wasn't any noise from the adjacent pool.)  As I was seated, the hostess gave me a drink menu which contained a respectable number of offerings.  (One of the couples eventually seated next to me weren't given a wine menu, the hostesses had evidently not retrieved them from the wait staff; their waiter brought them one upon request.) After asking a couple of questions of the waiter (he was knowledgeable of the cocktails) and asking for his recommendation, I settled for a spritzer (absolutely delicious) and some water (no ice, please).  I also ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup, the kale salad, and a side of the Brussels sprouts.  Within minutes of placing my order, my soup was delivered (hot, not scalding, so it could be enjoyed right away; hearty; tender cubes of chicken with a heaping serving of noodles).  While enjoying the soup (and consequently being warmed from the inside out), the \"bread basket\" arrived: warm, soft, chewy, pretzel sticks with a side of horseradish whipped butter (or was it aioli)--I am NO FAN of horseradish, but this was outstanding.  There was a bit of time before my salad and Brussels sprouts were delivered, so I requested some hot water with a side of lemon; promptly delivered.  The kale salad was good, though maybe a few more croutons than I would have liked, but balanced flavors and very filling.  The Brussels sprouts were superb and served hot in a miniature cast iron skillet.  With the little room I had remaining in my stomach, I chose to have dessert: layered cheesecake with dark chocolate cake.  This was the most disappointing item I put in my mouth all evening...but it was still good.  The cheesecake was creamy and delicious, but parts of the cake layer were too gummy/springy for my liking. By now I was full to nearly bursting and left half of it on my plate.  As I was leaving the restaurant I stopped to use the restroom: small (2 stalls and only 1 sink), but very clean.  Both my waiter, Dan, and \"busboy\", Cris, were attentive, courteous, kind, helpful, prompt.  Their service of my table and the tables next to me was excellent and helped turn what could have been a lonely dinner into a lovely dinner!",

When we arrived at 4 we were given a limited menu and told that we could not have a steak or the prime rib Xmas special but only a limited lunch menu.  They said we would have to come back in an hour if we wanted dinner (after we already had drinks and tried to order). We were annoyed but agreed to do that so we could have a real dinner.  We went to the front to insure we could have a table in an hour and we were told they were fully booked and we would not be able to get a table tonight.  Such BS and what a poor way to treat guests of Encore who stay here every year.  We were told they were booked solid the rest of the night, you would think if someone was calling to change their dinner reservation up they would tell you you can't have dinner at that time slot.   The girl at the front was extremely rude.  Well we decided to stay and sit for an hour and stair at each other since it was impossible to get a reservation anywhere in Xmas day.   The dinner was outstanding, pricey but you get what you pay for.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes that accompanied them were superb as well.   The lobster pasta was decadent and the truffle pizza appetizer with the poached egg was to die for.  Our server Roger was outstanding as well.  However because of the rude service and seemingly unorganized front end we will probably never dine here again.  Additionally the tables around us were never seated and for the most part the restaurant was less then half the entire time we were there.  They could have sat us an hour later with no problem.  Shame on you Steve Wynn and Jardin.  Last time we will ever go in there.",

The sitting area is right in front of the pool of the Encore. It was nice day with a refreshing breeze, perfect for brunch! We got the chicken omelette and wheat pancakes. The omelette was great, but the pancakes were not very fluffy and were somewhat underwhelming. We got two coffees since there were a lot of good reviews about coffee at this place, but the coffee was nothing extraordinary in my opinion (it was good, but not worth all the great reviews I had seen!). We asked to get to go cups for coffee, which they were happy to provide. Overall, if you have a choice between Jardin and Terrace Pointe Cafe, I highly recommend the latter. It is about the same price, but Terrace Pointe Cafe has better food and the same great view.",

The hostess greeted us with a warm, friendly smile; we did not have a reservation but we were able to get seated.   Our waitress, Amira was very friendly, her customer service was excellent. I asked her a few questions about the menu and she was knowledgeable about each dish and recommended the Branzino. It was very delicate and flavorful, I enjoyed it so much. I also ordered a side of the Brussel sprouts which were amazing (also recommended by Amira). My husband ordered the salmon and that was cooked to perfection, he ordered from the prix fixed menu.   Overall, we had an excellent dinner and superb service, to top it off the manager stopped by our table to speak with us and inquired about our meal and we talked about the flower decorations in the restaurant and he recommended us to see the decorations at the Wynn hotel.

    "text": "From a Celiac:  ** I never like to complain about service, but since this was so horrific- at a STEVE WYNN property, AND the food was bad, I have to mention it.  I was SO excited about trying this place because of reading the great story in the Wynn magazine about the new chef bringing fresh new flavors. We had always joked about the previous restaurant- Boterrible. It was Boterro, but we had to rename it because the food was so bad. The new renovation is beautiful, with fresh flowers, lighter colors, same amazing location. That is the extent of the redeeming qualities.  The Menu: Wynn restaurant pretty much all have allergen menus. Not this place. In fact, our stupid waitress didn't even know what gluten was. (I should've gotten up and left, since I was still recovering from unknowingly being served gluten at Allegro two weeks ago) I digress...  Wine: Wine? Where... where is it? Oh, the server took a lap around the property and 30 minutes later she brought the bottle. Didn't know how to open it. Then never poured one more drop for the whole meal. This is one of my boyfriends biggest pet peeves. He wants the server to pour the wine.   Appetizers: After asking a few questions, having the dumb server return from the kitchen a few times and  STILL not knowing what she was doing, we finally got appetizers, cold and wrong, but at least the boyfriend got some bread, with no butter, to eat with his self poured wine.   There was literally not one dish on the menu that looked appetizing to either of us. I just ordered sides- gross. Boyfriend orders a steak, which was not cooked correctly.   Dessert: Really bland, had no distinguishable flavors. Server leaves for the night.  Waiting......  Waiting.....  Last ones in the restaurant. We didn't mind because we both enjoy each others company, so we were in no hurry. Manager comes over and firmly tells us that we need to leave because the restaurant is closed. I interrupt and couldn't help but snapping at her that we hadn't even received a bill yet. It wasn't even that late, yet the manager chose to be SO unprofessional to ask us to leave. And we hadn't even been given a bill yet. I was FUROUS by this point. I try not to get mad at dinner, but all combined with this rudeness was inexcusable. All the servers and managers were dumb, lazy, ignorant of the menu, didn't know what gluten was, couldn't open a wine bottle, didn't know how to pour a wine bottle. When 2 people spend $500 on a meal and then have to complain about service, that is a MAJOR problem.   Boyfriend and I come to Vegas often and going to awesome dinners is the highlight. He let me choose this place because I'd been going on and on about it for weeks, wanting to try it. Not only do I not want him to have a bad time at dinner, I want him to keep letting me pick new restaurants! This was a major blemish on my restaurant selection track record.   Other reviews on Open Table also talked mainly about poor service. Didn't really see it here on Yelp though.  We stay at Encore sometimes 2-3 times a month. It's nice to eat at the property sometimes, but I will never go back to this disaster. Not even to order a to-go order to eat at the pool.",

One of which came with a side of salad as part of the meal. The spaghetti was taken back, but they still made it a point to separate and charge for the little bit of salad that was eaten (tacky, but whatever). Apparently it's not customary for the manager to touch tables with guests who've been inconvenienced, even though he was present, available, and made it a point to converse with the other diners. Three people in our group ended up foodless, and we couldn't get so much as a \"thank you, have a good evening\" on the way out. Just stares and scowls as if WE did something to them. I'm so disappointed.",

I have been to several of Wynn restaurants and this by far is the worst.I came with a group for a birthday and 3 of the plates that came out were cold,undercooked, and tasted horrid according to my colleagues. I have never been more embarrassed to dine at a so called 5 star venue.   I am a concierge and I typically enjoy trying places I've never been that way I can be excited when I tell my guest about it. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE IF IT WERE THE LAST OPTION ON EARTH.   General manager didn't even have the decency to check on the table knowing that we sent food back which to me is unacceptable.",

    "text": "5 stars-- As good as it gets!!! If you're dining in Las Vegas, you would be absolutely amiss to skip on experiencing Jardin at the Wynn/Encore. Experience it you must!  My Love and I have been here twice in the past month for the fine cuisine and expertise of Jardin Executive Chef Joe Zanelli. We are quite the foodies and tend to be particular about dining out (especially on the Las Vegas Strip.) These two experiences at Jardin were THE.BEST.FINE.DINING.EXPERIENCE. OF. OUR. LIVES. Truly, truly, truly.   Let me tell you more...  We were greeted at the restaurant entrance by name, which was a 5-star touch on it's own.  The food. I don't even have enough time to write about the spectacular array we feasted upon. Just try what speaks to your appetite! For dessert, you cannot skip that pot of chocolate cake; it's culinary divinity.    The service is next-level. If you want the best of the best, you must DEMAND Chuck be your server. Chuck at Jardin is the epitome of fine dining service and boy, does he set the bar high. Ask for him specifically and you'll see what I mean. The rest of the wait staff attended to our table like a well-orchestrated symphony.   The atmosphere is ideal for fine dining. The sound level is perfection; I loved that I couldn't hear anyone else's conversation. Jardin (translated to garden) is beautifully garden-themed, from a giant floral centerpiece in the dining room, to edible flower garnishes in the cocktails, to an edible flower pot dessert (again, a MUST-TRY) and the luxe flower garden and pool in the outside courtyard.   If you have an appreciation for all the aforementioned, definitely experience the gastro magic at Jardin.",

    "text": "In a word: disappointed.  In two words: very disappointed.  We had a larger party (more than 5 but not huge by any means).  Originally we went to Wazuzu, but the wait was over an hour.  There were some hungry people in our group that didn't want to wait, so the kind hostess at Wazuzu directed us to Jardin for dinner, as they have a larger dining area.  We put our name in at Jardin (the hostesses were very pleasant) and it was still a 20 minute wait.  Not great, but expected given the crowds this week, and not so long that we didn't think we'd have a problem waiting.  One of the people in our group kept saying that we should take a Lyft to Shake Shack.  I managed to convince them to stay since we'd be seated and eating soon.  I think we were seated within the 20 minute window, so no issues there.  But the problems were about to begin.  Our waiter took our drink orders fairly quickly, but walked away before we could order appetizers.  No problem, he'd be back soon with the drinks... right?  No, not True.  This took awhile as well, I'd guess around 10 minutes.  Long enough that by the time we got the drinks we were ready to order our entrees.  He finishes giving us our drinks and then, again, walks away.  Must have been going to get a notepad or something.  At this point, about fifteen minutes goes by with no contact from our waiter.  Finally I hear him at a table nearby talking to a small party.  Five minutes go by, he must be explaining the wine list.  Ten minutes, he's still talking to them.  I listen closely... they're talking about strip clubs!  I mention this to the people at our table and one of our party actually gets up, walks over to the waiter, and tells him that we're ready to order our food.  Never have I experienced this, but they were getting hungry!  Another five minutes or so goes by and he finally takes our food order.  Obviously we were inconveniencing him.  We felt this way after he took our drink orders, but now it was readily apparent.  We forego appetizers because, after waiting this long, our entrees will be out soon enough.  One of the bussers was kind enough to give us some pretzel appetizers on the house due to the wait, so that was good.  The wait to actually get our food was at least 30 minutes, maybe 45.  And when the food finally came out, one of the entrees was missing.  Whether the kitchen forgot to make it, or the waiter forgot to put the order in is unclear.  My money is on the latter.    We eat, while sharing our food with the odd-man-out, figuring his order would show up pretty quickly.  No... it was another 30 minutes before his food arrived.  He was considering just cancelling so we could leave since everyone was done eating, but then his food came out.  Of course, he didn't have a chance to cancel it since we didn't see the waiter in between the time he gave us our food and the time when the missing plate was ready.  The food itself was mediocre.  That's the best word to describe it.  No one at the table was impressed, especially surprising given how hungry they all were.  You would have thought they'd be ravenous, but everyone was kind of ho-hum about their meals.  We came in with the expectation of \"eating food soon\"; no high bar at all.  We left upset, some more than others.  I felt bad for convincing the group NOT to go to Shake Shack.  \"No, we shouldn't eat fast food for dinner.\"  Hell, we probably would have eaten faster if we'd stayed at Wazuzu and endured the hour-long wait.    I should never feel emotionally distressed after a meal, which is how I felt after dining here.  The burden of this terrible dining experience is on me, and I've now lost the trust of these people I ate dinner with after pushing them to eat at this restaurant, something I feel I will not be able to restore.  My reputation is ruined amongst those in the group, since I'd never eaten with any of them before.  I will never be able to forgive the restaurant for this, much less our downright terrible waiter.  PS: I do have to give a shout-out to our busser Cris who was far more attentive than our waiter.  He was the high point of this dismal meal for sure.",

Salad came with too salted Brie cheese but soup was perfect. Second course was turkey with classic cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes. Everything was melting on the tongue. Dessert was apple crostata with ice cream. Well... crostata came with too thick crust but apples and ice cream inside was really good combo.  Interior in restaurant is really great. Everything looks modern and elegant. I definitely will be back.  Price was moderate $55 per person. We end up paying $160 with drinks, tip and taxes.",

My husband and I both agreed the food was perfect, not like normal breakfast food. It wasn't greasy and it wasn't over or under seasoned. It was perfect.  My daughter got the hot chocolate and loved it, there was nothing left. She also had the 3 egg breakfast, the bacon was crisp to perfection. My husband had the Maine  lobster Benedict and I went with the kale scramble with pain au chocolate( chocolate croissant).  Overall it was wonderful and all the fresh flowers were bea I would love to return and try dinner next!  We dined here again for dinner. The ambiance was very nice, the lighting was low and service just as good. All our food came out in a good amount of time and it was perfect. We all loved the truffle fries, we love truffle everything. There were three of us and together we could not finish the flower pot cake. It was so moist and delicious.",

I can't say it's amazing because the lobster didn't taste fresh. It tastes like it's made from a frozen tail and not a fresh lobster. I would not order this again as it's below expectation for a $26 entree. Very little and low quality lobster meat  I much preferred the Crab Benedict at Terrace Point Cafe to the Lobster Benedict here. My dad only eats for fish and seafood and the only item on the menu was the grilled salmon. He was fine with it. You can also ask for it cooked rare or medium rare as opposed to having it fully cooked like other restaurants.   The pizza portions are huge and they taste great. The only thing is the topping is kind of skimpy for the prosciutto pizza.   I wish they have more lunch options, but the service here is outstanding.",

You are greeted immediately by pleasant, well-dressed and polished staff. They confirm your name by cross referencing it with your hotel stay and address you by it during your entire experience.  The seating is lovely, bright colors, sparkling place settings and a fresh brilliantly colored single flower. I choose to sit inside however there is outdoor seating that highlights the beautiful water. My seat gave me an upfront view of the outdoors, beautiful flowers, luxurious seating and the colorful plant life. Gazing out the window was calming and relaxing. As I was seated the host neatly placed my napkin on my lap. I was immediately greeted by another staff member, again by my name who filled my water glass and took my drink order. Once I received my coffee the staff member offered to go over any questions I had about the menu and offer suggestions. I choose coffee to start and the Jardin Burger with fries.  Everything arrived quickly and hot. Before I received my order I was given complementary warm twisted soft butter pretzels with a spicy mustard. Delicious!. My burger was not only delicious it was a beautiful presentation on a wooden cutting board along with lettuce tomatoes and a colorful hot pepper. The fries were so-so nothing to speak about they were eight dollars a little pricey but OK what the heck I'm on vacation.   In all it was a great value, the lunch items are not extremely pricing. I enjoyed the quiet time I spent glaring out into the courtyard. Every restaurant or customer service person at the Encore offers superior customer service! I enjoyed everything about this dining experience if you ever have the opportunity I highly recommend dining at Jardin.",

The Wynn always has beautiful flower displays. And the waitress was very attentive and sweet. We came for my birthday lunch mostly for the flower pot cake.  The food in all was good, nothing spectacular or anything to come back for but because of the cake, and service it was still a great experience.  We started off with a margarita pizza, it was good but soggy.  Then my friend had a salad and I had the salmon plate, again both good but nothing out of this world.  The flower pot cake is gorgeous, it's a chocolate cake with a little cherry filling I believe. Everything is edible including the flowers and white chocolate birthday card they give you with it if it is your birthday.",

My friend had reserved the table for us in the event of a huge crowd and I arrived 5 minutes later and already had water and waiter was all set to introduce himself. Shortly after taking our order he brought out complimentary pretzel sticks which I thought were unbelievably delicious.   The best part of the experience was the view. We had an outdoor table and it was right next to the pool giving a wonderful vibe.  The food was delivered 13 minutes after we ordered and was fantastic. The waiter always kept coming back to check on us and refill our water which was great because it was quite hot.  In short the experience was nothing short of perfect and I would be willing to dine there in future trips to Las Vegas.",

I'm all for paying $8 for OJ when it's truly fresh squeezed.. but when you give me a glass of sour, watered down crap, you're shitting on my whole day! My hubby felt the same about the coffee...both those items being the first sips of the whole day, you want it to be good and get you off to a great start. Go weak with it, you might as well throw water in my face and send me on my way. That's a bit dramatic, but we take our OJ and coffee seriously!  You look at a place like Jardin and, wow, what a stunning GORGEOUS scene. Fresh flowers boasting throughout, mirrors everywhere. You feel you're in for an amazing dining experience.  But, no.. no.. the experience IS the visual scene around you because the food is meh. The service was weird too..I couldn't keep track who was my waiter or busperson and I felt our busguy was more helpful than our waiter and our waiter was hella snooty.   I had the lobster benedict with hashbrowns (which is more of an herby potato brick) and my hubs has the pancakes. I liked the benedict OK, I had to ask for more hollandaise sauce, as they literally put a thimble-full on the eggs. I had a bite of the pancakes and they were just doughy, no fancy flavors..I didn't even taste vanilla or any other flavor enhancements that could be used to make pancakes amazing!  So there ya have it. If you're just wanting to grab a drink or take in a beautiful setting. Jardin is the place to do it! If you want an amazing breakfast within the property, try the Terrace Point Cafe.",

There is a large case in the center with silk flowers and a ring on the ceiling above. It was pretty, but not elegant in my opinion.   The server came right over, got us water and coffee stat. Our orders were taken in a reasonable amount of time and our food was out in 10-15. It filled up shortly after we got in.   My chicken and waffles consisted of a large, breaded chicken tender and a piece of French toast with a Frosted Flakes type breaking and a sunny side egg in the middle. There was no waffle. I don't know why they call it chicken and waffles, but it was really good none-the-less. The French toast was very nice and flavorful. My hubby had eggs benedict  and said it was \"pretty good.\"   Nice and simple and close to the room. You don't have to go out in 111 degree weather.",

The center atrium is just so relaxing to look at. The food was incredible! I had the Nutella Hazelnut banana French Toast, which not only had great presentation but was delicious, as well! My 11 year old son had the lox and bagel,  which he found to be very tasty and my wife had the lobster benedict which she thought was outstanding. I was able to try the Cubano, which I thought was just ok. I ordered the Orange Lavender Mule - incredible... My wife tried it and it is now her favorite style of Mule out there on the strip.  Our second trip, I had the Grilled Cheese with tomato soup -Hands down one of the best grilled cheese I've ever had. The tomato soup tasted like a slightly rich marinara sauce was outstanding. Dipping the grilled chees into it - decadent. My son had the organic Salmon which he crushed and was extremely happy with. My wife had the Caesar salad with chicken which was really delicious!  We doo look forward to coming here again whether we have guest in town or not. It is a wonderful restaurant with great food, service and scenery. Highly recommend this place!",

For example, my husband asked to substitute the cauliflower mash that came with his prime rib for some French fries. When we got the bill for an extra $9 for the fries and questioned it, the server said he had asked the chef and the chef said \"no\" to the substitution because it was cheaper to serve the tiny portion of cauliflower than a potato!!

That staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  The wife and I had a nice romantic dinner at a window table overlooking the pool.  We started with the complimentary pretzel.bread and ordered the Margarita flatbread (like a thin crust personal pizza).  Then we had the Oven Baked Prawns and the Short Rib Ravioli.

Came here for brunch with one of my girl friends and we sat outside, weather was just right, not too hot/cold. Plus we got to enjoy views of the Encore pool. Jardin means \"garden\" in French and this restaurant is suppose to make you feel like you just stepped in one. Lots of fresh, floral arrangements in the restaurant and a huge one right in the middle of it. We both got the Orange Lavendar moscow mule and lobster benedicts. The moscow mule was strong, but still blends well with the orange, which I liked! Keep it coming! And the lobster benedicts was just how a perfect lobster should taste like with just the right amount of buttery goodness! The staff is so accommodating here. On another occasion, I came and just missed breakfast service! The waiter told me he'll check for me because there still was some breakfast items in the kitchen. Sure enough, I still got to have my bacon, eggs, and potatoes! This place is a Wynner!",

    "text": "WOW!  Went there for dinner before the Moody Blues concert.  What an amazing meal!  I thought that we would be served a \"Pre Fixe\" meal of lesser quality- boy was I wrong.  Our reservation was not on the list, but despite that hiccup, the whole experience was extremely enjoyable.  The meal started with fresh-baked-warm-from-the-oven pretzel sticks served with mustard butter.  We had an appetizer next.  I had the beet salad which was good (had to look deep for the beets), my husband had the quinoa salad (huge portion), but the best appetizer was my friend's meatballs.  Four huge spicy chicken meatballs in a thick homemade sauce.  They serve this in an adorable cast iron skillet with a hunk of melted cheese in the middle.  Our main course was the filet- which we all had at our table.  OUTSTANDING!  It was cooked to perfection and soft as butter.  The dessert choice was a pear crostada or a small assortment of pastries.  GO FOR THE PASTRIES!  There were 4 servings of the best desserts I've had in a long time.  The chocolate \"cake pop\" was the most delicious.  There was a butterscotch pudding, a mango macaroon, and red velvet cupcake along with the cake pop.  The wine selection was fabulous and the glass we got with the prefixe meal was really good!  I would definitely go back- and would recommend this beautiful setting for any celebration.  The outside seating is spectacular at night!  Great place!!!",

This time, third time, it was a charm. I had 2 glasses of fresh squeezed green juice. It was so refreshingly pleasing to my taste buds; I was tempted to have several more glasses. We pretty much randomly picked various dishes. All of the dishes were so tasty, wowing all 4 of us.  The waitress was cheerful, eager to serve, and actually listening and accommodating whatever whims we had. She even spread jam on the left-over bread that we wanted to take out, truly above and beyond.  We were seated right next to the centerpiece of \"royal\" bouquet, humongous and grandiose and still very elegant.  We paid $200 for 4 of us, a bit pricey, but we still felt real good; worth every penny it was.  Instead of the long lines at Wynn breakfast buffet, this is now officially our favorite poolside breakfast nook in Vegas.",

On Saturday, they had a Bloody Mary & Mimosa cart rolling around the restaurant, and it was fantastic!! Made to order, and the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!  Service was hit or miss.  On Saturday, we sat inside.  It took a while to get coffee refilled and the food took a while to come out.  On Sunday, we sat outside, and the waiter was fast and fantastic. The kitchen is where Jardin could use some improvement. I would skip anything with poached eggs unless you enjoy raw egg whites.  On Saturday, I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Hardly any of the white was cooked. I'm not sure how they even got the egg to maintain it's shape on the plate.  On Sunday, I ordered the lobster Benedict.  I noted upfront the issue from the day before, and still one of the eggs again came out with raw whites! I'm not asking them to master rocket science, just to cook the whites of an egg...!",

I first came in around 1pm to meet a girlfriend, who had been waiting for me at the bar for a good 10-15 minutes, and she was still waiting to place her drink order. We ended up eventually ordering a drink and chatting for a bit before the pool. After leaving the pool we were hungry so we decided to go back to the bar to order some food. Like I said our food was great, but the service wasn't great, I'll just leave it at that. My guess is they were going through a shift change. Anyway my smoked salmon and beet salad was excellent and so were the french fries and broccolini. They also had some amazing gluten free bread, which I've never had before, but my friend is gluten free so I tried it and I absolutely loved it. I definitely want to eat here again, but I'll probably sit at a table next time.",
