The crust has a nice body too it with a crusty bottom, a bit of chewiness and a nice flavor. The slice was huge.  The pizza was topped with roasted pork, bacon, sausage, ham and pepperoni.  This is a great pie!  I know I could stop there.   I checked in on yelp and cashed in on a free gelato.  Holy smokes - \"I, Jason C. hereby solemnly swear to never eat regular ice cream ever again.  I do declare to eat only handmade gelato from Old School Pizzeria.\"  The pistachio gelato was that good.  I was ready to leave when I asked the guy behind the counter if those were \"homemade cannoli shells?\"  I asked because the shells were dark.  Real cannoli shells have a darker color because they are made with red wine.  It is rare to find homemade cannoli shells.  He said, \"yes.\"  I said, \"oooo I want one.\"    Goodness - Authentic gelato and a real cannoli.  The pizza.  This place is legit.  Bring cash.",

    "text": "Old School is a breath of fresh air in a neighborhood of crappy chain restaurants and limited choices. It's not perfect, but it seems to strive for something close to that.   I've only ever had the pizza and the salads here. I tried to order a sandwich they had on the menu once, but they were out of chicken. The specialty pizzas are unique and very good, I love the one with pesto, although drawing a blank on the name currently. Veggie pizza has lots of toppings, even eggplant! My only complaint is the crust; it's thicker than I prefer. Gio's salad is okay, and the house salad is truly delightful. That mozzarella though... Damn. Yes, I'm salivating over a HOUSE SALAD. Great lunch specials, big slices of pizza, decent prices.   Small restaurant, therefore limited seating. Good, quick, friendly service. I hope you choose Old School over Pizza Hut. Dig deep in your wallet and just do it ... and try the salad.",

I had eggplant, olives, onion, and pepper on my huge veggie pizza slice and I chose the garden salad as my side. The salad has this delicious garlic marscapone dressing, which also comes with the rosemary garlic knots as a dipping sauce! I had to give the garlic knots a shot too based on all of the great reviews on them- definitely a must!!- I was further impressed by the service and passion for cooking of one of the workers--perhaps the owner's son? He enlightened me about the dough they make there and how it allows for a more colorful creation.",

The pizza was okay, it could've been better as was the huge calzone. In my opinion the problem was not the sauce nor toppings, but the dough. In fact they're one of the few pizzerias to use quality black olives which is a huge plus in my book.  The mascarpone dip was freaking delicious as promised. You can't say you don't get your money's worth.  BUT... The baked 5 cheese pasta was UNBELIEVABLY, INCREDIBLY good...probably the best take on Mac n Cheese I've ever had. I could live on that stuff.  The cannoli was also fresh and tasty and the guy was nice enough to pack the filing separate from the shell so it didn't arrive home soggy.   I might go back for a second try especially for the pasta, but Darrin B. answered my wife's review kind of nastily thinking it was me. I should add that her review was written prior to tasting the pasta and cannoli so I don't agree with her 1 star either. His response to my wife's review which he mistook for mine was kind of insulting so I'll have to decide what's more important...my pride or that ridiculous baked pasta. Yum-o! Seriously!",

Do yourself a favor and try the stuffed chicken wing. The mac and cheese is amazing; and will give you heart desease.  My only complaint is that they sometimes cook the pizza too long (monster slices). I prefer a softer rather than a crunchy crust.  They also recently installed a new soda/cola/pop machine and it has soda with lemon by Dasani. I recommend that to go with your pizza.",

But I have been here over a dozen times and every time I order ahead and come to pick it up rather it be online or talking to someone in the phone they mess up my order. It's not hard large pizza half pepperoni half cheese. If they don't mess it up then they say it will be ready in 20 mins and you get they 30 mins leather and they haven't even started your pizza. So you have to wait another 20-30 mins what's the point of having online ordering or even calling it in. They need to know their times and how long it take to make things and just make it right. Seriously 12-15 times here and I might say maybe just maybe only once has my order been right but that was only  because I came in and placed the order in the actual restaurant.",

Everything is fresh, and the menu offers a lot of choices with most ingredients being organic, everything is homemade. Very reasonably priced and great portions. Love the \"old school\" feel of this place. We love the pizzas (both whole pies and by the slice) the salads, and the neat fresh lemonade they serve in canning jars. Fresh pizza dough and bread....YUM!  We have been back several times since discovering this place on a whim....The staff here is gracious, friendly and very customer service oriented. Every single one of them. Absolutely impressed every time. Anytime we are in North Vegas, this is our spot. My highest recommendation, it's great on every level!!!!!  :)",

It's a great spot for a quick lunch, especially if you're at Nellis AFB.   Chef Gio's crust is a superb sourdough base with the perfect mix of crunch and chew. He has a very creative mix of speciality pizzas or you can create your own. I love how you can see the \"magic\" happening on the pizza line through the plexiglass. I've also had the Crazy Good Chicken which lived up to its name; it's one of the most delightful chicken dishes I've ever had. The braised ox tail special (on Saturdays) is out of sight, the tenderest meat you've ever had.   All in all, if you stop here once, you'll come back. It's a hidden gem in North Las Vegas, less hidden now that Yelpers are on to Chef Gio's genius. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

    "text": "I gotta give it up for this little pizzeria.  Working on this side of town can be a challenge for a foodie, and Old School Pizzeria made my day today.  I went with a couple of coworkers, and was more than pleasantly surprised.    I split a 14\" five cheese pizza with one other person.  The size was perfect for two starving fellas.  The crust was perfectly cooked; lightly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The inside of the slice was thin, while the outside was puffy and doughy. Perfect crust here folks, I enjoyed every bite!  Obviously the cheese was the highlight of this pizza, and it was an amazing one at that.  I have had a few five cheese pizzas in my pizza eating days, and this one is definitely the best.  All of the cheeses were high quality.  Lightly oily from the cheese itself, the \"grease\" level was moderate.  The ricotta cheese though... holy crap.  Just do yourself a favor and order anything with this ricotta cheese on it.  I've never had ricotta that tasted this creamy and delicious, almost as creamy as cream cheese!    We also tried some of the pistachio gelato and cannoli. The cannoli was fresh and excellent, although not the sweetest cannoli I have had, which could be a bad thing or a good thing depending on your tastes.  Personally, I don't mind a less sweet dessert.  The crust was a dark brown and made fresh with coffee.  The cheese was fresh and lightly sweet.  The gelato though was a mind blower.  Words can't describe the perfect flavors coming from this pistachio gelato.  You gotta try this stuff!  Update: The \"Roast Chicken\" is actually Sous-Vide prepared chicken.  This is a special process that involves wrapping the chicken and potatoes in a vacuum seal and cooking in water.  This retains the juices of the meat and taters.. and it shows in the flavor. It is so juicy that the juices from the chicken collects in the dish as you eat it.  Yum!  This dish is very savory and full of garlic flavor.  Absolutely delicious and unique.  I noticed someone accused the chicken as being \"soggy\" or something like that, so I thought I would make this update to address this wonderful dish.   I can't wait to start bringing my friends and coworkers to this little pizzeria.  It has trumped my previous favorite Italian/pizza in North Las Vegas and is now my go-to for pizza.  I'll be coming here frequently for sure!",

I had their lavender lemonade which was delicious and just the right amount of sweet. If you bring the mason jar back you can get your next lemonade at a discount. I drank that while I waited on my 5-cheese macaroni and cheese and watched the people working there make pizza behind the counter. The macaroni took a little longer to come out than I would have liked but it was worth the wait and since they pizza oven/prep area is visible through a glass wall, at least I had something to entertain me. As you can imagine, the dish is extremely rich so I couldn't finish it....or make room for any of the canoli's they also sell. Definitely worth your time.",

So yesterday I came home from work and my hubby told me there were leftovers in the fridge from the pizza place on the corner. Cool, I was hungry, and leftover pizza is always a good thing. I pulled it out, threw on the toaster oven, warmed it up, and (insert singing angels and trumpets blazing) IT. WAS. GLORIOUS. The sauce that came with the amazing garlic knots (with chunks of roasted garlic cloves!!!!) was better than a boring Ranch that I expected. The pizza.... the crust was actually flavorful, not just your typical white flour muck the big chains use. Almost like a sourdough. Amazing. The sauce was thick and also flavorful which was refreshing in itself. And the big chunks of, what was it, basil? that I found on occasion really sent my taste buds into ecstasy. And don't get me started on the meatball and sausage slices. I'll be here forever!! Why oh WHY haven't I ordered from you guys sooner???!!",

I actually found the roasted potatoes and garlic that came with the chicken to be even a little better than the chicken itself. My next visit included two of the monster slices, one with meatballs. The ingredients all are high quality, from the cheese to the sauce to the dough. The meatballs clearly are made in-house as well. The crust is thin like New York pizza, but has a little more crunch. The service is friendly and helpful, and it's pretty hard not to like the place. I only wish I lived a little closer.",

So last night was the night, while the ambience in the restaurant is nice and you can watch them make your pizza, their menu was ala carte only. No family meal deals or pizza/wing specials.  I ordered a large pepperoni/sausage pizza and rosemary garlic knots.  I was not impressed with their homemade sausage and pizza crust was tough to chew.  The garlic knots were hard around the edges and equally tough to chew, not enough garlic and way TOO much rosemary.  For 10 knots they put an entire sprig of rosemary on top which made a few impossible to eat. Was very disappointed!",

    "text": "I have been to Old School one other time. I got the Crazy Good Chicken. It really was good, maybe not CRAZY good!. The other day I called and ordered 2 meatball sandwiches. A friend of mine wanted to try the food here and I always like to try an Italian restaurants meatballs. The sandwiches are  $10 each which is a little pricey but I figured, judging by the size of the pizza slices, they were probably enormous. Was I wrong! The \"bread\" was just pizza dough (kind of like a Stromboli but the fixins were put in after it was cooked) But I thought that's ok cuz the pizza dough is good. There was sliced meatballs on it (sliced like a topping for the pizza) and there was MAYBE one and a half meatballs worth of meat. The sandwich was pretty much a whole lot of pizza crust with a little bit of meatballs and sauce. There wasn't even any cheese on the sandwich, they never asked if I wanted any either. For $10, I think that is absurd! My friends sandwich was exactly the same. We were both disappointed. I have yet to try the pizza. The slices are huge and they make their own dough which tales 36 hours so they have a sign admitting they may run out of dough some days. The place was very busy, all the tables were taken & people were waiting but it is a very small space so people were everywhere. It seems like they are caught between being a take out place and a sit down restaurant. I have yet to go back, I sent them an email regarding my visit but I did not get a reply.",

The outdoor aesthetics aren't appealing but the inside is cute. When you walk in to the left there is a wall with chalkboard paint that you get to write all over and around the restaurant there are riddles written in chalk. The light fixtures are cute and give this place the homey feel is deserves. Okay on to food, we ordered the garden salad and small pizza. I don't recall what the name of the pizza was but it had prosciutto, cherry tomatoes, arugula, date cream sauce, and ricotta cheese. This pizza was definitely one of the BEST pizzas I've had in Las Vegas. The crust was crunchy but soft and not dense. The flavors played off of each other so well and you could taste all of the toppings in every bite! I promise you won't be disappointed.",

They must have changed cooks. We always order the Classic Combo. This time there were hardly any ingredients on the pizza , hardly any cheese , and the pizza was the thinnist of the thin pizzas I've ever seen. It was so thin and also  mostly just sauce on crust that it sagged and fell apart. It was also kind of flavorless. Unless this place steps up their game again I doubt I'll be coming back. It's sad as I used to recommend it as being the best in Vegas. Now I'm embarrased to recommend it. I have to say that as it stands now the BEST pizza in Vegas award goes to Linos Pizzeria on Tenaya in NW Las Vegas right off the 95 and Ann rd.The following is my original review from over a year ago. - My family is an old Sicilian family and I am picky when it comes to Italian food. This place is the absolute BEST pizza in the entire valley. It doesn't get any better then this in Vegas. Fuggetaboutit !!",

    "text": "All we can say is wow.   This was our first visit to Old School Pizzeria - from a 1st choice recommendation from Siri. We read through a handful of the Yelp reviews and decided that 4.5 stars by over 500 people was a good sign.   We went in on a Tuesday night just before 8pm. About half the restaurant was full. We walked up to the counter and told the guy (Jose) that we were first timers. He walked us through the menu which was great since we didn't really know what to expect.   We ordered garlic knots and a small carnivore pizza. Knots came out first. Piping hot which was great. (Our only suggestion is to ask for marinara for dipping since you get a side of ranch with it.) They were slightly crispy and soft in the middle.   The pizza came a little bit after. It was a little greasy, but nothing less should be expected with all that meat and cheese. Nothing a napkin couldn't help with. The pizza was nice and hot also.  The toppings, what can I say about the toppings... as a first timer. I was impressed. There were strips of chicken, strips of bacon... and sure enough, the menu says homemade meatballs (that were sliced.) It was amazing. We were thinking cubed chicken with the bacon bits - like what you would get at a dominos/pizza hut setting, but this was NOTHING close to that.   After the delightful app and entree we had to try the cannoli. Sure enough - it was just like the rest of the food - Spectacular!  And of course, I think Jose should get a lot of the credit too. He staff always makes or breaks the experience as a whole. He was our greeter, cashier, waiter, etc. We only talked to him a little bit each time he came to the table, and each of those times we learned a new piece of info... the conversation really rounded the whole dining experience.   The only thing I would change is I wish you could have the option to pay at the end instead of upfront. I think we would've tipped more on the back end, then upfront when we ordered (before even trying the food or experiencing the service.)  We will DEFINITELY be coming back.",

    "text": "I love this tiny pizza place that offers giant pizza slices. Their OMG size pizzas are ridiculously huge! My favorite is the four cheese pesto pizza, which comes with toppings of pine nuts and Mediterranean olives (can substitute for plain boring black olives). The wings and cannoli are off the charts! Italian sausages stuffed wings with a hint of sweetness sprinkled with some pistachio crumbs. The cannoli has a cinnamon sugar coating (extra crispy) with again ...pistachio crumbs adding to the crunch in every bite. Now you know this place is \"crackin\"!   While you wait for your food, take a look around and take in the rustic and hippish feel of this place. They've got fun riddles on the chalkboard wall for you to solve. The service is always consistently awesome, just like the food.  They offer wine by the bottle or glass and beer on tap. If you are a wine drinker like myself you can get the bottle of wine for almost half off if you purchase it to go. Yes....I said to-go!  If you are looking for an intimate setting (not big enough for large groups) and some real authentic Italian style pizza or pasta, look no further because this place has got way more than what you expect. You know they are authentic when you get a funny look for asking about ranch. Nope, they've got this yummy creamy and thick mascarpone dipping sauce for your pizza instead!",

Plus, the lemonade is amazing and the decor is so darn cute.   I am more than happy to go back and give this place another try on a good day. Perhaps, I just had a rare experience. With the customer service I received from the owner, I'm certain my next visit will be much improved. I look forward to trying a pie and more lemonade in the near future.",

The prices are better than most places in north Vegas. This is my new place to order pizza from. Give it a try",

There is an atm machine....but I personally like the convenience of using my debit card at POS.  I will definitely be back. Cant wait to try the baked ziti!!",

When you try the pizza, you'll think you've died and gone to heaven. Although we live half an hour away, from the first time we tried it, we've made the pilgrimage at least once a week.  The Pork Rules pizza is completely addictive. the antipasto salad with the meat and cheese pinwheels is amazing. You can also order a half or whole roasted chicken which will undoubtedly be the juiciest, most flavorful chicken you've ever tasted. You must save room for dessert. The gelato and cannolis are handmade on site. For the first time, I finally understand the fuss about cannolis. Chef Giovanni, thanks for making this as enjoyable as the Atelier de Joel Robuchon or any other top restaurant (and for keeping it eminently affordable so we can come back frequently!)",

    "text": "I have been meaning to try this place. The menu seems pretty interesting. I walked in, at a time, when I thought it wasn't too busy. I was wrong. I guess they had some big catering going on, and they seemed to be racing against time. Working in the F&B industry, I understand. I ordered a Calzone with applewood smoked bacon and spinach. Also, the one thing that caught my attention, Rosemary and garlic Knot bread. with their ranch, that had a hint of rosemary spice to it, best part of the meal. Great flavor, they say that they use a natural leavening dough, meaning everything is natural even the yeast, takes longer to cook, longer to proof, had a sourdough taste to it. Great appetizer. Next, to the Calzone, it was average. I don't know what it was but nothing stood out. I've had different types of ricotta. This one was not appetizing at all. Dough was a little undercooked. I am not sure if it's just my personal preference but I wasn't a big fan of their dough, as other yelper's are stating that they have really good pizza dough. Maybe I am just so used to instant yeast and high-gluten flour, that I maybe missing something. anyways,  What saved it was the mozzarella and the other toppings. Great portion with the sauce, and bonus points for using Cristofer Columbo tomatoes. Great product, as I have used those in the past. I might try some other things here in the near future, maybe a slice next time. Service was kind of slow, but like I said It seemed like they were busy in the back.",

The cannoli actually were the best we've ever had- crisp outside with a delectable filling. Also, the nutella gelato was unique in flavor and a perfect end to the meal.

I walked in thinking I was going to get the pizza, but when I looked up at the menu, I saw a sandwich called the Darrin. I don't remember everything on it, but it had applewood smoked chicken, pears, carrots, and some exotic cheeses all on a pizza crust/foccacia style bread. I thought it read delicious so I ordered it. Went over and sat by the window in the sun. Noticed a Tv with remote to my left. Also, there were toys for kids. Let me tell you this sandwich is AMAZING. Probably the most unique sandwich I've had. The bread first of all is delicious, but then you get the sweet taste of the pears balanced with the old time vintage flavors of the cheese. Every bite is a bit different. And to top it off,.. the guy, Darrin was cool as shit. He did tell me that the sandwich is only going to be around for about one more week tho, since he feels it is time to change up the menu. I'm excited to see what masterpiece will replace this badass sammich. Go and get one right now!. Let me know what you think!!!!!! This place is one of the few places that has surprised me since being in Vegas. no idea such good food at this unassuming location.",

The sauce is NOT the usual sugary, bland tomato sauce - it's savory and yummy, and the crust a nice mix of chewy and crispy and tasty, too! They have some very creative combo pizzas and the stuffed chicken wing is supergood. The salads are always fresh and the knots are great. The calzones are huge and worth the dough (sorry, couldn't resist!) and it's only 75 cents per topping added in. I never have ordered anything that didn't come out quickly and fresh. The pizza by the slice is huge, and the slice combos are very good deals!   If you have time to eat there, the staff is very friendly and they play cute Italian music.

Walking up to the business we almost thought it was closed but when we opened their main door we were surprised to see one of the nicest decorated pizza joints around. This was was great and I would highly recommend if you are in the area.   Their pizza here took me back to Italy easily, everything seems freshly made plus the slices are jinormous and one could be enough, however I ate two on my own. They make few teas and drinks that are in jars and are super tasty as well. The staff is really nice and helpful as well. Don't expect super fast service as they make everything fresh and fresh means time making it.   They may need to do some work on the outside sign because it does not match the amazing food and atmosphere inside. I will be back here for sure!",

When you walk in the location itself is super small so I recommend taking your order to go or getting here early to snag a spot.   Their food is outstanding! The pizza slices are giant, one slice is about the same as 2-3 normal pizza slices and the taste is seriously delicious. The dough is unlike any other place I've found in the valley, it is the perfect amount of crispy and tasty. They have some other great food options too like mac n cheese, garlic knots, meatball sandwiches and salads. They also have some pretty great lunch specials like a slice of pizza along with a side salad or side of garlic knots.  I highly recommend checking this place out if you're a pizza lover like me!",

And hidden gems of crunch from the pistachios? All my favorite things in one! Don't be fooled by dates in your food. SO GOOD.   Also tried the Pork Reigns pizza. Definitely a kind of pizza to hip your carnivorous friends too! Delectably meaty!   You can't go wrong with the burrata and caponata bruschetta. If you LOVE eggplant, this is a must order. Burrata cheese just melts in your mouth. How do you NOT enjoy it? I can order this and eat this with a sausage stuffed wing for my lunch.   Now the sausage stuffed chicken wing? Topped with pistachios! Nom nom nom nom. Need I say more?!?!",

We had the garlic rosemary knots (as another yelper said, \"just do it\") and they are absolutely glorious and after eating a few realize that there were cloves of roasted garlic resting in the bottom of the bowl. Totally awesome. My husband and I shared a small pizza. And we are both pretty hearty eaters and we're completely full afterwards. We shared the Vegas meets Italy pizza and I cannot imagine even trying anything else because I will never be able to not order it. This pizza is the perfect combination of flavors with each by giving you another surprise and getting better and better. It has smoked provolone, mozzarella, ricotta, pistachio, dates, heirloom cherry tomatoes, arugula, prosciutto, and date cream. !!!!!! We were fortunate enough to show up at a time when it was not busy which apparently doesn't happen very often so we got the best seat in the house right in front of the chefs preparing our meal. And as if you needed any other reason than the fact that the food is absolutely outrageously great they cleaned the entire time we were there. The bathroom was also very clean and well-stocked. The service was impeccable with friendly people who absolutely took care of everyone in the restaurant. We will absolutely be making this a regular on our restaurant rotation.",

Stuffed wings are a good side or app, but you can't skip the garlic rosemary knots- they're accompanied by several pieces of spreadably-soft roasted garlic! The antipasto salad is loaded with fresh ingredients and flavor, and makes a good lunch for those looking for a healthy option.   This spot is noteworthy in that they use naturally leavened dough, as well as organic and artisan toppings and ingredients. The whole pizzas are pricey ($20-30) but use quality ingredients.. and can feed an entire crowd. If you want to impress at your next Superbowl party, this is definitely your spot.  I initially felt that serving the pizza with a side of ranch dressing went against that whole \"old school\" vibe, but it's actually a garlic-mascarpone dip! Unfortunately, the service has been borderline on every visit. Most recently, there were three people working and 4 tables covered in trash and dirty dishes in the middle of the afternoon and the space is already small with limited seating.  That said, the great food will keep me coming back all the way across town, regardless. Someday I'll get around to the porchetta sandwich, the grilled rosemary lemonade, and that chicken dish, but so far I'm in love with the pizza and haven't been able to resist ordering that.",

The pizza's are priced fairly for the quality and freshness that you are actually receiving in exchange. Seating can be a bit of a wait, but they accommodate you as much as possible! We had to wait at most 15 minutes but our food was just ordered so it didn't really matter too much as diners come and go. I planned to take it to go if nothing had opened, but alas, a nice table did! They also have a wine bottle deal if you take your order to go, so there's that extra if you do find yourself unwilling to wait for an open table. Everyone here is very nice, excellent customer service. The cashier even let us taste the wines so that we could pick the best one! How awesome is that?!",

If I was still in the area, I definitely would, it sounds scrumptious and that's even without the reviews here, just looking at the piks.  But, for whatever reason, I didn't, I ordered a \"small\" pizza with meatballs, $14.05.  Gotta say, it was not very appetizing.  The crust was burnt, and the \"meatballs\" were uh, interesting--are they suppose to be flat and a thickness of a half dollar (and just looking at them, the texture doesn't exactly start the juices running)?  Neither the pizza itself, nor the meatballs, were very tasty.  Wouldn't order the pizza again, but if I happened to be back up in that area, would definitely try the chicken.  Just wish I had done so, instead of that pizza.  Suddenly Papa John's (I know, I know) is beginning to sound good.  Sigh.  I miss that $14.05. Sniff.",

The menu offers pizzas with a myriad of delectable toppings such as homemade sausage, caramelized onions and roasted mushrooms.   We each had pizza slices with cheese and personalized toppings.   They were humongous and delicious with fresh veggies and meats and lots of flavor packed into the sauce and cheese.  So good.  Dip one of those slices in their garlic marscapone sauce and you'll forget ranch dressing was even a thing.  And it bears repeating that the pizza slices are ginormous.  They are serious about size and no one is going home hungry.    I also had a Gio's salad on the side.  (Tomato, cucumber, fennel, onion and mozzarella with a house vinaigrette)  the salad was perfectly composed with a great balance of flavors from the acidity of the dressing  and the cool creaminess of the mozzarella.  Just yummy.  (Also, if you order a full size salad it is served in a bread bowl.  Yes please!)  So glad we found this place and I will absolutely be back!  I am looking forward to trying their organic chicken dinner with potatoes and stuffing or one of the daily specials.  This place was a pot of gold at the end of my google search.",

Once you start heading west of I-15 on Craig options greatly improve. Yelp led me to Old School Pizzeria.   It's across from The Cannery. It's a quaint space that sits no more than 30. The have a slew of toppings and very large slices. I find one to be plenty for lunch. I've tried the pepperoni and a combination of veggies. I like the pepperoni a bit better than my choice of veggie slice with mushrooms, onions and tomatoes. Slices come with a side of garlic dipping sauce. A slice and drink is about eight bucks.  The crust is crisp and the crust to sauce and cheese ratio is pretty balanced. It's a good slice of pie. They also dish up salads, pastas and a few daily specials. They are pretty famous for their garlic knots, but I'm yet to try them.",

    "text": "In Las Vegas for work and yelped places near work;  Old School came up. I am really glad it did.   If you like beautifully made, delicious, Italian food and pizza. Get in your car, boat or fly here; try the food at Old School....You will not regret it!  I had the Grilled Rosemary Lemonade and now I'm ruined. I will only drink lemonade like this for the rest of my life. The taste of the char on the slices of lemon add a dimension to the lemonade I can not describe, other than YOU have to try it. And rosemary in lemonade....Yes it works...I will now spend the rest of the weekend trying to duplicate that lemonade....As the guy behind the counter was describing how they make it I impulsively reached into my wallet and dropped a $20 into their tip jar.   The Lentil soup was delicious, small dice(s) of ham, lots of lentils and other veggies, a great texture; seasoned perfectly. I licked the bowl clean and used those incredible roasted garlic/rosemary bread knots to make the bowl clean enough to use again. I've made lentil soup, and this is great lentil soup.  As I was plowing through that wonderful pizza with pepperoni, grilled onions, grilled italian peppers I commented on the great tasting pizza crust. Just then I noticed on the wall a sign that states they use only wild yeasts and long fermentation for their pizza dough..Right then I knew this was no ordinary pizza place....Doing that takes much too much time; so this owner must really love the details of making excellent quality food.  And it shows in the flavor of everything I ate here.",

    "text": "There are plenty of good pizza places in Las Vegas, and depending on what type of pizza you like, you can probably find it here. But this small restaurant in North Las Vegas is one of the best in the Valley, especially if you like New York-sized artisan pies that you can order whole or by the slice.  I went to lunch with three co-workers, and we each had a \"monster slice\" -- and they're not kidding with the name. These pieces were HUGE! I can't imagine what a \"double slice\" would be! I had The Veggie, which was a melange of fresh vegetables (including one of my favorites, roasted garlic). My boss had a traditional sausage and pepperoni, and my other co-workers each had the College Favorite (ham and pineapple) and the Calabrese (salami, peppers, and olives).   These were all pretty tasty, and I didn't even go near the two menu items that piqued my interest the most: the Vegas Meets Italy (dates, pistachios, prosciutto, and triple-cream gorgonzola) and the Pork Reigns (name a pork product, and it's probably on there). But my husband is pork's biggest fan, so I thought I'd save that latter order for him next time we see a movie across the street at the Galaxy Theater. (LOVE that place!)  Our lunch quartet also shared some garlic rosemary bread knots (delicious) and cannoli (even better). Service was quick and pleasant, although I felt like a heel because I didn't leave a tip. (I didn't notice a tip jar on the counter, although my boss later said he saw it and tipped. Now THAT'S a first for Vegas -- an inconspicuous tip jar!)  As I said earlier, this place is small, so you might have to wait for a table. But it is definitely worth the wait. And next time I'll definitely tip!",

Get a smaller meal and two cannoli, they're that good. Onto the calzone; I got meatball and my buddies got meatball/sausage/ham. There was no grease in the calzone! The highest quality mozzarella mixed with a perfect crust with just a little flour on the outside to cost your fingers! The pizza dipping sauce was on point and warm. The setting is quaint, seven or eight tables with a soda machine and a television. Great music and the kitchen is right there to watch the dough fly into the air. Great service and good prices on top of it all!",

This is the pizza by which all others are compared. (in L.V. at least)  Pizza crust is light and crispy, sauce is delicious, ingredients are fresh... I haven't found a single thing that they could improve upon. Oh, and the garlic knots... the best I have tasted.  I hear the other food is good as well but I just can't get past the pizza to give anything else a try.  My only complaint - They are closed on Sunday and yes, today is Sunday damn it!",

Want to understand their frustration?   Let me start by saying their dough is hand made.  The sausage is prepared in house , so fresh you can taste it. The shredded chicken was juicy , and the roasted garlic was cooked just right! I'd be mad too had I not made it on time! The pizza pie was damn good!    To be honest , they can close their doors whenever they like. They got it like that. Just be sure you order plenty ahead of time. They have families and want to go home just like us.     I will be back ... and I will try the garlic knots I forgot to order !",

    "text": "It's not often, actual just about never, that pizza gets thrown away at our house...but sadly enough it has happened a few days after our visit to Old School.  So we were coming back from a hike in Moapa, we were both hungry and tired, pizza sounded like a good option. We were gonna go to our go to place, Grimaldis but I knew we'd be passing Old School Pizzeria and have heard rave reviews, so we agreed to give it a try. The website has an online ordering service so while my husband was driving I was ordering. It sent me a confirmation text that the pizza would be done by 5:57pm. Well we got there about 5:50, so I ran in, it didn't seem too busy so I ran to the restroom before I picked up my order. When I came out I stood at the counter for a few minutes before I was greeted and asked what they could help me with. I showed him my order confirmation on my phone, he couldn't seem to find it, then printed a slip, and whispered something to the chef. I heard the chef say it was in the oven. I was told it would be a few minutes, so I ordered a Coke and sat down, well it was about 15 minutes later when I actually got my pizza. They really didn't seem that busy, but watching the 2 men making the pizzas, I could see why it took so long, they were very slow! First of all I have read many reviews on this place that say \"This is a legit old school type pizza place\", it's not at all. The inside is a bit \"done up\" for a pizza place, the cooks were definitely not Italian, they don't toss the dough old school style. Old school pizza places don't give you ranch dressing with your pizza. But I digress. The pizza looked delicious. We got home and dug in and we were quickly underwhelmed. We got a Half Carnivore and Half Sausage. It was very \"meh\". We ate so we weren't hungry and hoped that in the morning the leftovers would reheat better. Oh and that side of ranch was not good, it didn't help the crust...it may have made it worse. Well we tried to reheat it the next day, well there was no improvement. We both ate a piece just to eat something. the next day we collectively decided to throw it away, my husband will usually eat anything and he didn't even want it. So the service and food was subpar, I will never waste my time with this place again.",

The first visit we tried the Vegas Meets Italy, which was fantastic! Smoked provolone, pistachios, ricotta, prosciutto, date cream sauce - delicious! We also got the to-die-for garlic rosemary knots, and I got a salad with their delicious mascarpone ranch dressing.   Most recently we couldn't decide what to order, (besides the garlic rosemary knots) and the gentleman taking orders suggested the Pork Reigns. I was hesitant, as it had salami and pork jowl, two things I have convinced myself I would hate. He assured me that it was delicious, his favorite, and that pork jowl wasn't where I thought it was located - it's a cut from the neck and shoulder, not what I refer to as my pork jowls when I grab my double chin.   I am so glad I listened to him because the Pork Reigns certainly reigned supreme on our pallets!! The crust is perfectly chewy without being tough, and despite a plethora of pork bounty and cheese, the pizza was not the least big greasy.   Our only dilemma here is what to order next time, and who gets the roasted cloves of garlic from the garlic knots?!",

I added bacon, sausage, garlic, extra mushrooms, pepperoni, and cheese.  While this wasn't cheap, it made up for in quality.    This thing tasted great!  It was cooked perfectly.  Baked on the outside, cheese creamy on the inside, all the meats cooked to perfection.  I was 100% satisfied w/ this dish.  Pizza slice -$4 - Above average- A \"monster\" slice of pizza runs about $4, and the name should be taken seriously; the size of the slice is about the size of a football!  I was able to try my friends pizza slice and it was delicious.  Thin-crust, crunchy, and not over the top oily.  Fresh ingredients too.  A slice by itself should make any person full.  Tips: -Not good for large groups.  The inside probably houses about 15 people to sit.",

They chop it & put it in a bread bowl. Delicious! Pizza was good but a bit heavy. Will definitely try something lighter. Also had the homemade cannoli on the first visit. So good. Both times, the person taking my order was helpful & knowledgeable about the menu. Great pizza and great customer service. Only reason for the lack of a star is the parking but will always go back there.",

I've been back twice, and I still haven't had a memorable pizza experience, but I really enjoyed the rosemary garlic knots and side salad with mascarpone ranch dressing on my most recent visit. I was impressed by these items so I also ordered a cannoli to go. The crisp, homemade shell was filled to order with a light cinnamon-spiced ricotta cream and dusted with powdered sugar. With each bite, I was also dusted with powdered sugar. I'm sure that I will think of this simple, delicious dessert any time I find myself on this side of Craig Road.  They have also made some improvements to the dining area to make it more attractive. It's still a comfortable place to eat with children, as the chalkboard walls are a welcome distraction until your pizza comes out of the oven.",

The food is amazing, the place is small but impressive on the inside, the staff are awesome and extremely helpful AND did I mention the DELICIOUS FOOD!!! Before I ordered I wanted to try everything, my mouth was watering and I found myself taking photos and video of the actual pizzas being made! I had a great feeling to start my pizza experience here. I immediately loved the unique variety of the menu: Unlike many pizza places, you can get a huge pizza slice here and add toppings and additional items making it a meal for under $10... really? Im doing that for next time I think... mmm! They have great specialty pies too; Calabrese, Pork, Vegas, Vegetarian and even a Pesto... I may try one of these first... yum! So much to chose from but... wow! It was a tough call but I always try a plain cheese pizza and antipasto salad before anything else to see if the basics line up for my family and myself and WOW! I watched Mario make my pie and tasted his delicious handy work... fresh herbs under the cheese, hand tossed with a dough 36 hours in preparation... WORTH EVERY MOMENT I waited and WORTH EVERY PENNY I paid...  I will be back. A LOT. I don't live close, but I WILL TRAVEL to get MY Old School Pizza! I Old School",

Good quality toppings on the pizza (whole black olives, good mushrooms instead of cheap button mushrooms...although I DID find a pit in one of the olives which could have been very bad).  Solid chew to the crust with a mild sourdough flavor.  The bruschetta was superb with the fresh homemade bread they served it with.  Very good indeed.  Finally, the knots had a good garlic flavor although 2 of them were a little burned.  Small little place but it seemed to do a steady take out trade while we were inside.  One of the better pizza places I have been to here in town and I would definitely return.",

You can taste that they are quality and fresh.   There are some interesting selections for pizza or you can build you own to suit your tastes.   Of course there are negatives.   The price is pretty high for a pizza.   We got 2 smalls and paid over 40 bucks.   Also, the cooks are the servers so it wasn't the cleanest (I sat at 3 different tables looking for a clean one and my bf found dead and one live cricket in the bathroom.)  But overall I'd eat here everyday that's how good the food is and that's why they still get 5 stars!",

    "text": "Old School Pizzeria has won my heart a couple of years ago, but not for their pizza.  Their Crazy Good Chicken is just that, crazy good.  This meal comes with two thick and juicy pieces of baked chicken (roughly 8 oz.), big chunks of potato, and stuffing. Butter and olive oils is then drenched all over it.  It's crazy thinking about how good this chicken is. Where else can you get chicken this good at a pizzeria?  So far, only here. If chicken at a pizzeria is not your thing, then get a pizza.  Each slice is huge, especially their Monster Slice at $4.00.  Toppings will cost you an additional $.40.  Their pizzas remind me of an old school giant pizza that you'll find in the streets of New York City.  In my opinion, I think Old School is better.  You can't have a meal here without trying their Rosemary Garlic Knots.  6 knots cost about $3 or $7.99 with a Monster Slice.    The service is always great.  There's usually a line at Old School Pizzeria and it's mostly for take-out.  Keep in mind that Old School is very popular and it takes time to prep a pizza and even longer to bake their Crazy Good Chicken.    Prices: Crazy Good Chicken - $11.99  Monster slice (little over $4 - $.40 additional toppings) Small Pizza (serves 2-3) - $11.99 Large (serves 3-4) - $16.75 OMG (serves 5-8) - $24.99 Calzones (serves 1-2) - $8.99 Five Cheese Mac - $12.50 Meatball Sandwich - $10.00 Monster Slice & Half Order of Bread Knots - $7.99  Overall, I recommend Old School for their pizza and of course, their chicken.   2017 Yelp Review #83",

The people I was with all ordered pizza and I ordered the Five cheese Mac and cheese to try something new. Don't get me wrong it was delicious.. until I found bacon pieces in it.... And I am a vegetarian. From what I saw all my friends order and the pizza I've ordered in the past, their menu was very black and white, it explained details of what was in their food. Except the Mac and cheese which really made me upset. Didn't bother to make a big deal of it cos I really do like the place and it wasn't a huge mistake or anything. I just wish the menu explained that there was bacon in it. Gave the rest to my friend though and he really liked it! Would recommend this spot to anyone!",

The parking lot is a bit of a squeeze, which was also a preview for the pizzeria. It's counter service with someone floating around to food run. The menu is written on chalkboards on the walls and also above the register. The staff is friendly and knowledgable, and I think they were just as excited as I was that this was my first time.  The pizza was delicious. I mean, it's pizza. I went with the Five Cheese Pesto and added their house-made sausage. Melt in your mouth good. The knots weren't as garlicky as I hoped, but they were fluffy little balls of bread heaven. I will 100% be ordering the Garden salad again. I'm not sure what the creamy dressing is, but I want to bathe in it.  I'm now plotting to get pizza from here, since reminiscing about this experience, tonight for dinner.",

You order at the counter, take a seat, and they bring your order to you.  You can order pizza by the slice (and it's a HUGE slice) or a full pie in various sizes. They have a menu of speciality pizzas or you can create your own.   When our pizza arrived, it was tasty, but completely burned all over the bottom. We weren't sure whether or not to say anything. We eventually did and they immediately apologized (numerous times) and made us a brand new pizza. Which was just great customer service.  You can eat in, take it out, or even have it delivered via various delivery services. I'll definitely be dining here again when I'm in the neighborhood.",

The owner is clearly passionate about what he is doing over there, and it has a True Italian vibe.  The salads are amazing, and they have a chicken wing stuffed with sausage that is equally amazing.  I grew up on the east coast in the Philadelphia area and know good Italian pizza, and this is it!  I looked all over Vegas for this place, and I drive over there regularly.  The only feedback I have that is not overwhelmingly positive is that one night I was in there and the music was up a bit too loud.....normally it is at an appropriate level so you can talk to others without shouting, and normally it is the appropriate music...(i.e. Frank Sinatra, or classical).....for the place.  If I had three thumbs, I'd point 'em all up.  Dave S/North Las Vegas",

I was just hoping it would be halfway decent because I have a hard time finding good pizza after living in Boston ... and being Italian. Boy what an awesome surprise! Fantastic sauce, fresh and well seasoned, thin sliced sausage instead of that crumble crap and sauteed mushrooms! And to top it off, they piped me three fresh cannoli I decided I wanted at the last minute. My Pops couldn't say enough good about the crust and toppings. And the cannoli made his night. We def will be back. Hopefully they will have a special and have arancini again some day :)",

All the ingredients are top notch - I loved the marinara they used.   So fresh with a little kick to it.  They allowed us to call in the order so the pizza was ready when we got there.   They messed our order up and brought out a Pep. and Sausage instead of Mushroom.   It looked so good I was fine with the mistake but they brought us a side of mushrooms and when they found that they did make the Pep and Mushroom pizza, they gave us the second pizza free!  I would be giving this place 5 stars with or without the mistake.  I ll have to come back to try their stuffed chicken wings and their octopus potato salad.   The garlic knots were so comforting and filling and paired nicely with the garlic aioli.  It was much lighter, refine, and better than a ranch or other dressing.  We spent about $20 for a 2 topping pizza  and would go back any day of the week!",

We ordered an order of garlic knots and 2 of the OMG pizzas for a group of 6 guys and 3 girls and found that it was more than enough which was fine by us because who doesn't love leftovers?!  Food: Garlic knots - Basically garlic bread sticks. These were very tasty and I found myself wanting the garlic knots more than the actual pizza itself. If you're a garlic lover like I am then these are a must-try.  Pork Reigns - The pork reigns was definitely my favorite out of the 3 pizza types we ordered (we went 1/2 and 1/2 on one of the pizzas). With pulled pork, calabrese, sausage, and bacon this meat monster is sure enough to satiate any cravings the hungry carnivore might have. The pork meats all had a pretty strong flavor which was definitely a good thing.  Calabrese - This pie contained calabrese, olivers, and hot peppers if I remember correctly. The peppers were definitely a nice addition and I wish that they were added to the pork reigns. Overall the calabrese had a much more balanced taste than the pork reigns so if you're trying to go lighter this is definitely my recommendation.   Five Cheese Pesto - I didn't actually try this one but the general consensus was that it was tasty however the ricotta was heavy; maybe a little bit too heavy.   One thing to note is that all of my toppings kept falling off. This might have been due to the fact that the pizza was still hot and the slices so big. I also felt that the crust was too bland and didn't give enough flavor.  Overall: If you're hungry in N. Vegas and craving pizza, give Old School Pizzeria a try.",

Stuffed chicken wings were top quality as well.   The place has a bit of a hipster vibe which I didn't care for but did not take away from the dining experience. Pricing was very fair and the portions were generous. One of my favorite pizza restaurants in Las Vegas. This place has earned its reputation. I will definitely drop by again.",

    "text": "Maybe I've just been spoiled with amazing pizza, but Old School's pizza did not amaze me much, but I'm going to attribute it to a mistake in choosing the pizza flavor.  The crust/dough could have been thinner in my opinion, as it became a bit too much to chew after the first piece. I had the Vegas meets Italy pizza and really did not enjoy having ricotta cheese and dates on my pizza instead of some fresh mozzarella. Should NOT have listened to their recommendations.  The staff here is incredibly nice though. You can tell that they are trying to make food with integrity. I will definitely come back here if given the chance so I can try other flavors.",

The light fixtures give great light and the music sets the mood. Large plastic wall lets you see the pizza being made...my kids loved that.   Bought a jar of rosemary lemonade and it was pleasant to the taste. Not powerfully sweet like regular but good tasting.    The pizza arrived pipping hot and the plates were hot too so it stayed hot longer. The 24 inch pizza will fill your belly quickly. This time around it was a lot better....no paper  This time around we were impressed with the explosions of taste while devouring the slices.  Then to our surprise the five cheese baked mac came over. Sublime is the only word that comes to mind. You must, nay, have to order this dish. We were all full from the pizza but the mac made us eat it. Talk about good torture, this is the only way to die.  Great joint to sit and enjoy good food. This is a must visit if you want to be amazed. Thank you for the wonderful tastebud vacation to chesseville.",

The lemonade is very interesting and not like any lemonade I have ever had.  A small pizza fed three.  Prices are not bad.  A little high or pizza, but the quality makes up for it.  Toppings are also gourmet.  The cost of salads and sides is reasonable.  I'm going back as soon as I can.  If you are the sort of person who thinks Little Ceasars makes good pizza this might not be the place for you, but if you can tell a quality crust from a frozen crust you will like it.  I've had some high end pizza in my life and I'd put this place against any of them.  A real gem for North Las Vegas.",

    "text": "This is what happens when you are too hungry too function so for the first time in your life you don't read people's individual reviews and/or look at photos on yelp...  You believe the menu that says that an OMG size pizza feeds 5-6 people. So you muster up the brainpower to do the math and order 2 OMG size pizzas for your group of 10 because I mean, 10/5=2 right? And I'd like to think we are big eaters.  SO WRONG. SO SO SO WRONG.  My boyfriend goes to pick up the pizzas and calls me with shock in his voice double checking that he was picking up the right order because apparently the pizzas are HUGE. I didn't really imagine how huge until they came home with the 2 boxes and we were shocked at how they even fit it in the car door.  Each pizza slice is 1.5 times bigger than your head. I'd say easily 1 foot tall and 8-9 inches wide in the crust!   The pizza itself is thin and flimsy, so even though we asked for it well done, there is no structure for you to shovel this behemoth of a thing in your mouth. So I had to roll up the pizza onto itself and then later opted for a knife and fork.   We ordered the Pork Reigns: House Braised Pork, House Made Sausage, Ham, Guanciale, Applewood Smoked Bacon and Salame Calabrese with Mozzarella and Tomato Sauce. This was the better of the two, although I did not find/see any braised pork at all.  and the Classic Combo: Caramelized onions, Roasted bell peppers, Roasted Mushrooms, Black Mediterranean Olives, House made Sausage, pepperoni, tomato sauce. This pizza was just okay. This one is definitely not as loaded as the Pork Reigns. The olives are fresh so be careful many of them still had pits!  The red sauce in general was full of flavor and so were all of the cured meats. The crust is definitely chewy and leaves something to be desired. And if you don't like rosemary, don't get the garlic knots, because they are packed with rosemary flavor.  For 2 OMG pizzas + regular size of Garlic Knots = $102. It was good but it wasn't the best. But we were grateful for how quickly it was prepared along with the convenience of something other than Mexican fast food in North Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Super delicious pizza?! YES!   Old School Pizzeria is seriously super yummy! Its right across the street from The Cannery on Craig and its not a huge place. The location, though far from my place, is pretty quiet and nice. Inside OSP it's VERY clean and bright! I love the chalk board walls and all the information throughout the inside. You go up to the counter and are greeted by the pizza maker and he gives you a quick run down of the menu. They have 3 sizes of pizza you can order, as well as single slices.  I chose a \"big\" cheese pizza and a side of garlic knots. You order off an iPad and it even has one of them card sliders on the side for convenience. Your receipt is also e-mailed to you! Santiago and I sat down to wait for our yummies as the pizza maker go to work. It was really neat seeing him knead the dough and get it ready for us. Before we knew it he was placing it into the oven and getting out knots ready. Whilst we waited Santiago drew on the chalk board and I watch tv.   The pizza was ready in about 10-12 minutes and I asked for some ranch, which he informed me was actually homemade and mascarpone cheese and spices! YUM!  Off we went to Summerlin! I was a little sad because I figured the pizza was going to be gross and cold when we got home, alas it was still warm and yummy! Upon looking at the pizza you can tell its homemade and not the stuff from other chain places. On the walls it says the dough is made in batches every 36 hours so they do tend to run out. The dough here is perfect and chewy but not overly chewy, its seriously good! He put the right amount of sauce on the pizza as well as a good amount of cheese! The rosemary garlic knots were sooooooooo good! I seriously wanted more!  For the pizza and knots our total was around $14. I did also tip since it was 8:45pm and they were closing at 9pm.   I will def come here again when I'm on this side of town! The cool thing is, even 2 days later the pizza still tastes amazing!  YAY!",

The Chef Gio salad is a great alternative if you're not in a pizza mood. Try their ranch dressing for dipping! It's literally THE BEST ranch dressing I've ever had.  However, the last 2 times I ordered a Vegas Meets Italy, I didn't find any dates on it... That was super disappointing because it's one of the best ingredients on the pie. I'm not sure if they stopped adding them or maybe they are out of season (since they buy them local).",

I didn't think the pictures looked appetizing but with 4 and 5 star reviews I wanted to taste the pizza and judge that myself.   I started out with a \"Side Antipasto Salad\". It was very fairly priced at just $3.49 and came served on a plate that was annoyingly too big but it tasted good. Nothing wow about it but good.   For the pizza I was impressed that it is made to order right in front of you. I wasn't however impressed with the taste. I ordered a 18 inch \"1/2 Pepperoni & 1/2 Sausage pizza. When the pizza was brought to the table it was covered in grease. I used several napkins to mop what I could up. The first 2 bites I enjoyed the crust but after that it was just a greasy soggy mess. The pizza wasn't worth $17.49. I would like to give this place another try some other time since there was a sandwich that sounded interestingly good. I'm just not itching to get back too soon.   They also offer calzones, sandwiches, chicken, pasta and desserts. If you have a large group then you should check out their family meal deals. Also that have a \"Monster Slice\" that is well, *monstrous*.  You can get the monster slices individually if you don't feel like a whole pizza or are just stopping by for lunch then you can combo it with a drink. Orders can also be placed online.",

    "text": "Great little gem hidden in the middle of a strip mall. Hub & I split a calzone and a cannoli. Both were delicious. You can tell they really use fresh, quality ingredients here.   Only two downfalls that made this not a five star rating:  1. Ambience. Dining in area is extremely tight. There's only about 7 tables in this restaurant, and patrons extremely are rude. Taking up a table for an extra pizza box so no one can sit next to them? Ridiculous.  2. Barber shop next door attracts ghetto people. I came out to find my car had been leaned on and hand prints all over it from teen kids playing around it.   Great food. Crappy ambience and location. Might want to consider an new location if they want to continue grow their business.",

CRUST: For their pizzas and garlic knots they use a sourdough crust that they let rest for days in advance. Every bite has that CRUNCH outside and softness inside. TOPPINGS: All ingredients fresh and high quality. Flavors worked great.  I also got a cannoli here which was pretty great. Seemed like a regular cannoli but the chef told me they do some kind of deliscious twist on it, but I don't know enough about cannolis to tell you what and I forgot what he said. I was too busy thinking \"holy ****, this cannoli is good\".",

The rest of the meats used to make a Pork Reigns are also tasty. The slice does get a bit salty, but I still enjoyed it because the sourdough helped contrast it. That sourdough crust is so perfectly chewy and crispy at the end. The quality of all the ingredients on this slice was top notch. - Stuffed wing: really flavorful. I love that they debone the wing for easier eating.  - Gio's salad: so fresh and so necessary. Full of yummy fresh crunchy fennel. The grape tomatoes and balls of fresh mozzarella, fresh herbs, so drool worthy.  - Garlic knots: wow! LOVE. Served with whole roasted garlic cloves and their house-made ranch. This is also made with their fermented sourdough, and it's so good.  - 50/50 iced tea lemonade: tastes a bit weird to me, I think there's a bit too much going on in this drink and I didn't like it. It also feels a bit expensive for this drink.",

I'd like  to think he was mildly curious because there was only 3 of us, and more MIL doesn't eat much. The pizza was great, NY style crust which is what we like in our house but the garlic knots lacked chopped garlic and seasoning so it was a miss but not enough to keep me away. Just had 4 cloves of oven roasted garlic with them which for garlic knots is weird to me. That part was my only complaint. Will order from again, not  h OMG size but a reasonable size for 2 adults.. if we do parties for our kids it will be the OMG because that size could feed an army!",

We ordered rosemary garlic knots and a 14in with pepperoni, sausage, olives, mushrooms, green pepper, and garlic.  The garlic knots came first.  They were amazing!  A good start that had us excited to try the pizza.  We would not be disappointed.  The pizza was absolutely delicious.  The crust is soft and fluffy on top and crispy on bottom.

The roasted garlic, pine needles, and ranch dressing make for an all around fulfilling experience. The garden salad, wow I've never had salad taste like that. Cannoli at the end, best I've had since my last trip to little Italy in NYC. And hey, the pizza is bomb. No joke this place is legit.",

After a long wait, we finally got our pizza. We started to dig in and my friends wife noticed there was, what appeared to be pubic hair, all over the pizza. I took it up to complain and the employee told me that it is what it is and went in the back and started making jokes about it with the other employees. We left disgusted and completely unsatisfied! I'll never be back there if that's the way they treat their customers!",

It doesn't look like much from the outside (I would really recommend new signage!) but we were pleasantly surprised with our dining experience.  We shared a large antipasta salad and a pizza. It came in a huge bread bowl and could easily be a meal by itself.  The pizza was fabulous.  You can tell it is made fresh, and we loved the open kitchen design.  The place is not very large which make dining in a little less comfortable than a typical sit down restaurant but we liked the unique decor and layout. The prices were very reasonable, especially for the quantity and quality of food.  Highly recommend!",

    "text": "After seeing all the rave reviews, I looked forward to trying this pizzeria myself.  Living in North Las Vegas, where good dining out options are quite limited, a fine pizza shop is a welcome addition.  And, unlike many all-purpose Italian restaurants that serve pizza almost as an afterthought, Old School has a lazer-like focus on pizza.  Plus, it produces excellent-tasting pizza!  But before I get ahead of myself, let me backtrack a bit--because I started out with an Old School Antipasto Salad, which turned out to be salame, ham, Provolone Cheese, onion, black olives, tomatoes, peppers, Mozzarella Cheese, and lettuce in a large, hollowed out bread bowl.  It was huge and the combined flavors were excellent.  I wisely ate almost none of the dough, and would have been just as happy to have had all of the ingredients presented on a plate.  It seemed like a big waste of bread.  Just after I placed my order for an 18-inch Pepperoni, Mushroom, & Sliced Tomato Pizza, chef/owner Gio began to turn away, and seemed surprised when I mentioned a second 18\" pizza for my wife.  I then told him that we \"don't mess around when it comes to pizza.\"  We almost always order two larges, eat as much as we can, and gladly take the rest home for additional meals.  Plus, from my experience large pizzas taste better than smaller sizes, just like it is harder to get a Petite Filet Mignon done right compared to an 8 to 12 ounce Filet.   My 18\" Pepperoni, Mushroom, & Sliced Tomato Pizza was a little greasy on top (which I actually don't mind) but excellent New York style pizza with mild pepperoni, tasty flat mushroom slices, good cooked sliced tomatoes, and both Romano and Parmesan Cheese dropped upon a delicious red sauce--except some spots of char on the underside of the dough made parts of my pizza taste a little bitter.  Neither of the other two 18 inchers at my table--a Cheese Pizza and a Sausage Pizza with Extra Cheese--were noticeably charred on their bottoms.  The sausage on top looked a bit unusual, because it was spread in the form of thin, flat, and long strips rather than small elevated clusters; the sausage itself was mild.  The cooked pizza dough was just right for a New York style pizza--not too thick and not too thin, pliable, foldable, and with just a slightly upraised outside edge.  All three specimens were mighty fine pizzas!    My small group of four also asked for some Cannoli and gelato.  For 4 dollars Chef Gio said he would take care of this for us, after which we were generously presented with three really excellent Cannoli and six small dishes of gelato, including Nutella (Chocolate Hazelnut), Peanut Butter with Coffee Crunch, and Pistachio.  Of these, the Pistachio Gelato had the strongest flavor; the Nutella was very good but not as rich as others I have recently sampled elsewhere; and the Peanut Butter with Coffee Crunch variety was fortunately muted in flavor rather than overbearing.  Be forewarned.  This establishment is very small in size, with seating for only 9 or 10 diners.  So I advise getting here before or after the dinner rush.  It will be worth the trip.  Only slight burning of parts of one of three pizzas precluded a five-star rating on this initial venture.  A solid 4-1/2 stars!",

Their Mac and cheese is now officially my favorite ever (and I make a damn good Mac and cheese). The pork reigns calzone was delicious. I prefer it as a calzone over the pizza...maybe because of the addition of ricotta. Mary's chicken was finger lickin' good with some tasty potatoes and stuffing. Overall another satisfying meal.",

The pizza was alright but the headache to complete an order with them and being treated poorly just isn't worth it. I don't think I'll be making the trip again.",

    "text": "I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars, but I like to see local businesses doing well (especially in North Vegas), so I'm bumping up to 5. First of all, the place is pretty tiny; we brought a group of 7 for lunch and almost took over the whole joint. The ambiance is total local pizza place, and I give them bonus points for having cute riddles up on the chalkboard walls. Answer correctly and get a free cannoli! The older lady up front was friendly taking my order, but not the quickest. A couple minutes later, Chef Gio (I assume) came up from the back and was much more efficient. Of course, the main reason I'm giving this place high marks is because of the pizza - the crust was really good, thin chewy sourdough, and they have an excellent selection of toppings to go with the tomato-y sauce and mozzarella cheese. The slices are not premade, so you can get any toppings you want. I got the chef's special 'Calabrese' - calabrese salami, banana peppers, black olives. Yum! Plus, the slices are HUGE, so one totally filled me up. I added a side salad and a drink, and the total came up to a reasonable $7 (which I paid via CREDIT CARD on the ipad at the counter!). Others in my group ordered the baked ziti, which I didn't sample, but looked really good and cheesy (minus points because it had peas in it - ew) and the meatball sandwich, which looked awesome and huge. We did not get the garlic knots, which seem popular in the rest of the reviews...next time! Overall, thank you, Old School Pizzeria, for bringing some local flavor to the land of chains!",

The pizza dough has the perfect amount of salt and there has got to be some fresh garlic or garlic powder in there somewhere giving it such a full bodied mouth watering flavor. When the dough is this good the pizza makes itself. The sauce and cheese are great too and fresh. I sat next to the pizza making window while waiting for my order and the smell of fresh basil nearly drove me insane (in a good way). This place knows what it's doing. Fresh, delicious and made with passion. The only reason I give 4 stars is while the pizza is awesome it's just too pricey.",

Only problem and it's not a problem is its kinda pricey. 11 bucks with tip for 2 slices and soda. I got onion and pineapple toppings but still. However very very good pizza.  I also tried a couple rosemary garlic knots. Very very good.  The pizza definitely reminded of good ole NY pizza. I like when you fold it the bottom lips \"falls down\".

The place may look a little rough on the outside, but please don't let that stop you.  I am one of those people who usually sticks to one thing on the menu (the original 5 cheese with red sauce, not pesto), but yesterday, I decided to take a suggestion from another yelper and try the Vegas meets Italy. OH MY. I think it may be the best pizza I've ever had. It was perfect in every single way.. Sweet, salty, rich, delicious. Their homemade ricotta is so heavenly. And while it may seem weird to put dates on a pizza, it was the perfect accompaniment  to the prosciutto.  Come and support your small businesses. This pizzeria is truly a gem!",

So I took to yelp, read the great reviews for Old School Pizzeria, and dragged my family over to experiment while there on a visit. They were not all too keen on the experiment since they tend to judge books by their covers, but am glad to report it was worth the trip...  Despite the plain exterior and the tiny interior, this place is a gem! I have no idea how people can find the slice and soda deal expensive...$5 and the slice is monstruous! We went for lunch and I could not bring myself to eat dinner, hours afterward.  The rosemary garlic knots are to die for, and my BF answered a riddle and got a free cannoli! All and all my family was quite pleased, ran out of there with a take home menu, and have proclaimed this place their new neighborhood pizza joint.   Great find, thanks yelpers!",

    "text": "This pizza establishment is a cross between almost upscale but very self help casual.  The music, furniture and decor makes it feel upscale and the help yourself to drinks and order at counter makes it casual.   There are very few tables, seven small to be exact. and a counter that fits three.  The floors are a bit dirty and the tables have plastic wrap on them. I'm guessing to keep clean up to a minimum.    Inside was incredibly hot and uncomfortable, this is why I'm leaving four stars. I know it's vegas and summer but I've been to plenty of places that weren't that hot inside.    The drink machine is one of those coke mixed drinks, I unfortunately don't like these. The coke always tastes terrible to me, even when I let it run before filling up cup.   The staff was very friendly, the owners cousin Steve was super friendly, caring and was very attentive to all the customers.    The pizza, I was recommended by a friend to come try it out. It was good, the crust was a little burnt, I however am picky about pepperoni and the pepperoni was actually very good! There wasn't a lot of grease from the cheese either.  I have to say the dipping sauce was pretty amazing!!   The restaurant is kind of in a sketchy area but for sure try it at least once!! I know a lot of people that rave about it, my son is a picky eater and he said the crust was delicious and wanted to always get his pizza here!",

I've only had the pizza and garlic knots here so I decided to try something new: the meatball sandwich. The meatballs are cut in half and served on a crunchy chewy roll with just enough melted cheese- because too much cheese can be gaggy- and a sweet, but not too sweet, red sauce. OMG- YUMMY! I could not resist getting a cannoli too. I just love the crispy pastry shell and creamy whipped filling. This place is the best pizzeria I've ever been to. The staff is awesome too!",

We topped ours off with garlic and were excited when we saw the pizza adorned with giant cloves.  I'm not a big fan of crust and usually give it to my hubby. However, this crust was not shareable. I devoured every flaky last bit of it. The server offered us some garlic dip and I jumped at the chance because I never pass up sauce. This was some of the best pizzas I've had in a while!!!",

They have interesting specialties with topping combinations you wouldn't normally think of, but taste amazing together. The perfect example is the Vegas Meets Italy- it has the perfect balance of sweet (date sauce) and salty (prosciutto). Their dough is handmade fresh with no preservatives. Their rosemary lemonade and garlic knots are tasty as well. Definitely ask for extra garlic sauce!  The atmosphere and decor adds to the overall experience- rustic, quaint, like a True old school pizzeria. It's a perfect date night spot.  To top it off, the workers there are so nice and have the best customer service. Even when the restaurant is crazy busy, they still manage take the time to come out from behind the counter to personally deliver the food to the tables and ask how your meal is going. We asked for a to-go box from over the counter and the server actually came out to hand deliver it to us at our table. It was such a small gesture but we really appreciated the extra effort.   There seems to always only be about three workers, and I noticed that the younger guy (didn't catch his name, but he's always there) goes above and beyond. He seems to do it all- he's the one taking orders, answering the phones, running the line, taking the food out of the oven, and even busing the tables. You can definitely tell that they all take pride in their restaurant and quality of their food.  I don't think you can get better than this. They were even featured in a Las Vegas magazine as one of the best restaurants. Definitely a must go!",

The Classic Combo has pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms and olives.  Vegas Meets Italy had gorgonzola, ricotta, mozzarella, arugula, cherry tomatoes, dates and pistachio - unbelievably delicious!  The sweet and savory flavors complement each other. I remember the pizzas in Italy all had the same quality: they were not greasy because they use FRESH and REAL ingredients.  That's what you get from Old School!  As a fan of all things Nutella, I had to get the Nutella gelato.  It's creamy but light...almost like soft-served/frozen yogurt.  Lurv it!!!  Something good in North Las Vegas.  Yay!  Best of all, they deliver.  The pizza place that was previously in this spot went out of business a few years ago and I'm hoping Old School is here to stay.  I'm pretty sure they'll do well since they have great food.",

It just happens to be across from on of my favorite theaters app deal worth a trip. Cozy dinning area. The garlic rosemary knots are extremely addictive. More to follow.  They made some sliced tomatoes with homemade vinaigrette with fresh mozzarella.... Yummy!",

    "text": "Wow! That is the word I would use to describe this place. I came out from getting my haircut next door, and I was hungry. I looked up the restaurant and saw it's high rating on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot.  As I came in I was promptly greeted by a guy behind the counter making pizza . I threw up my flag of first time ignorance, and I was given a run down of the menu. After the menu was thoroughly explained I decided on the garden salad, the rosemary garlic knots, the double monster slice special, and the canolis.  The salad came out first, and it was so good, I ordered another one after I ate the first. All the vegetables were fresh and crisp. There was shredded cheese throughout that added a nice richness. The salad was already dressed, but it wasn't soggy. The nice creamy dressing wasn't the star but helped bind everything together, it still had good flavor though.  This was the first time I got garlic knots at a pizza joint. Bread side items normally seem like a waste to me, but I am glad I gave these a chance. I could taste the rosemary and garlic on them, and the bread was toasty on the outside while having a soft and fluffy inside. The \"white sauce\" that came with the knots was addictively delicious.  Then the two monster slices came. They lived up to their title, they could have been over 1/4 of a pizza. I topped one slice with sausage and one with pepperoni, and it is hard for me to decide which was better. I'll just say these two slices sold me, and I will definitely be back to order whole pizzas here in the future. They weren't greasy, they had a good amount of cheese, and both of the toppings had their own distinct flavor. The sauce was particularly good. It wasn't a sweet acid bomb, and had a good taste of crushed tomatoes and seasoning.  The only downside to my meal were the canoli. While the cream inside had a nice smooth texture with the perfect amount of sweetness, the pastry shells were fried too hard and had a burnt flavor. That single infraction would only bring my rating to a 4.5 star.  I am absolutely sold on this establishment, and I will definetly be coming back to try more items.",

    "text": "Owner Giovanni emailed me, apologized for my experience and offered to refund any overcharge.  He obviously cares very much about his business and his customers.  I don't want a refund but do appreciate that he took the time to reach out.    This is not your average pizza joint.  Huge monster slices, grilled lemons in their lemonade, killer homemade ranch, awesome toppings: heirloom tomatoes, artisan salame, guanciale, pistachios, dates, want garlic?  It's not minced, they use whole cloves.  Pizza was excellent.  So why the 3 stars?  They messed up my order twice and I think overcharged me.  That or they are waaay over priced.  I wasn't given a receipt so I am not sure.  We came in for a quick bite before going to the movies.  I got the Monster Slice (with 4 toppings) and Knots special and my friend got a 1/2 order of knots.  We both got drinks.  Our total?  $36!  Yikes.  Nice older guy helped us at the counter.  He had a little trouble with the POS system and adding my extra toppings.  I got pepperoni, mushrooms, olives and garlic.  When our food came out my slice only had pepperoni.  I asked if I was charged for the other toppings I ordered and said if I wasn't I would just keep the pepperoni, no biggie.  They were super nice about it, checked and I was charged so they made me a new slice to go and gave me the plain pepperoni on the house.  Only problem that slice was wrong too.  Instead of olives they put onions.  I didn't say anything, they were so nice and wasn't going to have them make me another slice.  We shared a Grilled Rosemary Lemonade and Passion Iced Tea.  The drinks come in mason jars.  He didn't mention it and we weren't sure if we could take or should leave them.  The jars are pretty big, we ended up leaving them and not finishing our drinks.  If I had known I paid extra for the jar I would have taken it.  I learned later they take $1.50 off when you return the jar.  So if you get the tea or lemonade, take the jar.  That shit is good.  Don't waste it.  I am not in this area often but OSP is worth the drive.  I'll be back to try their specialty pizzas and I'm sure update my review.",

The small size is gluttonous for two adults, the sauce is just the right amount of sweet and the pizza itself a hearty thin with great bones.  Oh!  I almost forgot, they serve with a garlic infused creamy dip with is an amazing compliment to the cost and knots!!    The garlic knots are artisan sourdough  with toasted garlic cloves.   The dough, knots, cannoli are all fresh made.  The sausage is made in shop and sliced thin like salami, along with fresh roasted peppers and everything else.    Old School is the perfect name for the product and service we received.  We come through Vegas with regularity and this spot is sure to be on the list for future trips being a quick hop from i15.

Food is great, white sauce is awesome and the stuffed chicken wing is amazing. They really know how to maximize flavor with the use of some good herbs and spices. It felt fresh. Can't stress how much Carlos' hospitality made a difference to bring us in and the food Definately sealed the deal. Unique flavor, music and unique feel.",

However, this place offers a gourmet pizza with a side of sticker shock....ouch, a $30.00 pizza! But, what you are getting is not your typical pizza.   I was amazed by the fresh ingredients, the amazing flavor of the cheese, and the fact that the pizza didn't ooze with oil all over my hands and face. All the sauces are made in the restaurant, they are organic, and the dough is made daily. I had the Vegas Meets Italy - this is a must try.  While there, I decided to try a couple other things. I had the Gio Salad. It is made with fennel instead of lettuce and was served in a sour dough bowl. I loved it! I also had the stuffed chicken wings. Curiosity got me on this one, as I had to try it just because it was such a foriegn concept. I was absolutely amazed by the flavor of this stuffed chicken wing. You will be too!   I washed everything down with their homemade lemonade in a mason jar! Another big hit with me.  Somewhere between leaving a pizzeria restaurant and arriving at home, I usually have a stomach ache from too much dairy and bread. I firmly believe there must be some truth to the intolerance to gluten being in the gliadin and glutanin process, because I feel great. Honestly, I had just thought suffering to have pizza was a way of life :)   I will be back!",

They came with a type of marscapone aioli that was really tasty and kind of reminded me of ranch dip. The knots themselves are sourdough based and come with roasted garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. So goood--I stole all the garlic!  The pizza was really great--it had a slight char to the thin crust, enough sauce and cheese, a great texture, and the flavor was there. Everything was delicious. I wish I had room to try a cannoli or something, but alas. The garlic knots filled me up.  We sat at the table next to the prep, so we could watch the chef whip up the pizzas. The drinks and silverware are self-serve, but they bring everything out. It's a quaint little place that has great pizza. Stop on in!",

I ended up trying this place out the next day after hearing about the amazing cannoli's this place has to offer. Turns out is three minutes from my house so I owe her a great debt  for telling me about this piece of heaven or a bill for the clothes I will need to buy after my waist line increases. From the outside you would never guess what delicious food awaits but once you enter you quickly realize this isn't just a regular pizza place. They have amazing decor and fun riddles around. They have toys for kids to play with and tons of specials written up on the wall.  We ended up trying the Garlic Twists and a pizza Half Cheese and Half Pepperoni plus of course Cannoli's.  They make their own yeast and it all tastes so freaking good. I can feel myself gaining ten pounds just thinking about it. Everything was so yummy and the brothers who run the place are friendly and efficient. This is my new go to place for pizza. I can't wait to try it without my KIDS so I can eat some of the amazing stuff they offer that is more on the gourmet side of things.  They take orders via ONLINE or in Person so don't hesitate to try it even if you live a ways away.",

The owner was very kind and accommodated me. I asked him for recommendations, and told him to make me something tasty. I had a vegetarian slice, a meaty slice and an order of garlic knots. I don't know if the items or on the menu or what they are called. I think he may have just thrown together some ingredients.   The pizza is made right in front of you, and was still hot when I got home 20 minutes later. I can honestly say that I have never had pizza like this. The ingredients were very bold, and provided a unique flavor. I preferred the meaty pizza to the veggies pizza as the veggie pizza had some sort of broccoli that had a flavor too robust for my palate. The garlic knots were yummy. They were cooked with fresh garlic, and had an amazing sauce to go along.   I will definitely return. I will probably not pay as much attention to the nice Italian guy, and choose my own slice. Which reminds me - one slice is more than enough! It took me three days to eat the 2 slices and the knots.",

It is comfy, cozy, and the music is awesome. keeps a positive train of thought as you wait for your pizza. the wait was long but expected as they make the pizza right in front of you.. Literally they have a glass wall and you can watch them make the pizza. I had no problems waiting as the final product was ridiculous! ! we had the 18\" with cheese, eggplant, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and olives. along with their garlic rosemary knots. the pizza was great, the marinara sauce was very flavorful but not overpowering.  the mozzarella cheese tasted fresh, the toppings were very flavorful and did not disappoint at all! pizza was on another level from others ive tried in my opinion and is highly recommended. the garlic rosemary knots are awesome. the knots are a bit dense and tough but after all it is a knot lol! but I didnt mind as the garlic and rosemary was very intense and was a great surprise as the knots ive had around town fall way short on the flavor category, not these though! They are perfect and a must try with their pizza. oh I also ordered their cannoli and I am currently waiting to try them as I am stuffed!! we finished half the pizza and there was two of us and I am satisfied! ! if you like pizza and havent tried this place, put your usual pizza spot on hold for once and go here it will not dissapoint!!  Update: so I had the cannoli!  It was good. It did however taste like a twist on what a canoli im used to taste like. It has the look. The shell is good and crispy, very dense shell. The filling to me tasted like a cream cheese/ cinnamon cream filling. It was good, just not what I expected. Try it out and let me know what you all think??",

I have gone back and got a pie for lunch with some co-workers and took note that they got the toppings just right this time!   To flesh out my review a bit more this time I have to mention the nice sweet and fresh taste to the marinara. This time around I got sausage, pepperoni and Canadian bacon and it ended up as a real good mix of meaty flavors.   A last note, their crust is very good, crispy outside and the perfect ooey gooey chewiness I crave in crust...add in the creamy dipping sauce and I was in food bliss all day long!  3/5 star previous with today's update of 5/5 should yield a 4/5 for me but OSP has tipped the balance of my opinion and I'm giving 5/5!",

I wasn't expecting it, but the salmon came with a small bowel of plain spaghetti. I liked the buttery garlic bread they served before your meal. The service wasn't bad although I felt a bit rushed by the waitress on occasion. What I didn't like was the fact that they didn't offer my favorites, such as gnocchi and risotto (she did say later that they had gnocchi, but it wasn't on the menu). There were other things that I like that I didn't see, such as garlic prawns.",

The ribbon of carrot on top of the salad is a classy touch but the dressing on the salad is amazing.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is also great. They play old music-like Sinatra- and the lighting is great. There is a big chalkboard wall for kids to draw on and there's seating in front of the kitchen so you can watch them cook.   My only complaint is the lack of seating--if don't go before the lunch rush, you probably won't have a place to sit. Otherwise, I would've given 5 stars.",

    "text": "Holy cow, how did I not get here sooner?  I found myself at The Cannery last week for the Blues, Brews, and BBQ festival.  As a vegetarian, I was enjoying the Blues and Brews, but found myself rather hungry and not having much to do about it.  I'm not one to visit restaurants in the local casinos, and then I remembered many a fellow Yelper recommending Old School Pizzeria which happens to be just across the street.  So off we went for dinner.  It's a tiny place, but nicely decorated.  My husband and I considered just ordering slices until we realized we could get a whole pie for a little more.  We got a 14-inch for $10 and added two toppings for $1 apiece.  They offer many specialty pizzas as well.  With all the glowing Yelp reviews, I had high expectations for this pizza.  My goodness did it meet them.  The crust was perfect- a little crunch on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside.  The sauce was fresh and had a nice flavor.  And the best part?  The just-delivered-super-amazing heirloom tomatoes that topped my pizza.  My only complaint is that I wanted more of those delicious tomatoes on my pie.  We capped off our meal with a homemade cannoli.  Over the years I have found that a cannoli is a tricky thing at a restaurant- they are either really, really good or really, really not good.  So I mentally prepared myself expecting the latter.  Well, guess who was trying to talk her husband into ordering 3 dozen more of these babies?  This girl.  The food was great and the service was even better.  I'm not sure who was taking care of our order, but he was one of the friendliest people I've met.  He alone deserves a five-star rating.  Thanks, Yelpers, for your help!  Looks like I've found yet another place to add to my rotation!",

Much to my surprise, they had a special treat that day that they don't make often:  porchetta, or Italian pork roast, with an au jus type sauce.  Offered in the form of a sandwich on their signature sourdough, my mind was changed instantly.  Why not try something I'd never had before, especially when it smelled so heavenly?  And what a good decision it was!  Juicy with a crispy outer layer and full of flavor from the herb mixture it was stuffed with, it had a bit of the \"au jus\" poured over it that soaked into the bread.  All the flavors mixed together into one of the most delicious dishes I've had in a very long time.  I rarely eat my entire meal, but this was one I couldn't stand to let go to waste.  The moral of the story:  If you ever happen to stop in on a porchetta day, forget about pizza and eat the pork.  :)",

    "text": "This place is a trip! I love the cooks and the owner! True east coaster. First off we get here during lunch rush hour and there is literally a line out the door. So in my freinds infinite wisdom he asked the Owner \"What's good here\" the owner responds \"Are you serious?! I don't have time for this and throws him a menu and says \"It's all good..when you're ready to order get back in line\" hahaha love it!\" I ordered two slice... should of got one, they are huge!! Just FYI order the double (two slices) it's cheaper than ordering two single slices.    While we were enjoying our meal, a guy comes in thinking he was all \"gangsta\" and tell the cook, \"Hey make me 3 of those!\" The cook who looked like Popeye! Just looks at him then points to the register and says \"Order there like everyone else!\" then Mr Gangster yells at the owner...\"Hey Bro!\".. without skipping a beat the owner yells back \"THAT'S CHEF BRO TO YOU!!\". You can't have old school pizza without the old school attitude! Definitely coming back again",

You might be spooked by the toppings, but trust me they make an excellent pizza become a superb pizza. The man at the counter bet me that I would come back before I return to CA- he's right, I will.

The other problem is that it is so small that it would be tough to bring a group of friends to show off this little slice of heaven in the desert.",

    "text": "Yes, I am a fan of their pizza and believe it or not, because the crust is so delicious, the best pizza is their cheese pizza; the way good old fashioned pizza originated and was intended. If I need to add a lot of toppings it is because the good old basic pizza is not good enough.   Con, it is very expensive pizza. Yelp rated is $$ it is definitely a $$$ pizza joint and the ambience is just a simple basic strip mall facility with limited seating and bright lighting.  We waited 57 min. for our pizza to be made and served and they weren't busy, only two other tables were seated, one party already had their food and one got their food shortly after we arrived. I bought one soda for my son when we got there because I am not a big soda drinker but after waiting and waiting we ended up going to the register two more times to buy sodas for others. You would think that because of the extensive wait they would have just invited us to help ourselves to the soda fountain but that was not the case. I just think it would have been a nice gesture for good customer service. Yes, the one guy at the register was friendly but they should probably rethink their business model.  When your menu prices are that expensive, you need to make people feel like they are getting value elsewhere instead of feeling squeezed for every penny.",

    "text": "I hadn't been home in 2 years and because of that I had created a loooooong list of places to visit (for food, of course - who cares about anything else?) and intended on visiting most of them during my vacation.  One of the places at the top of my list was Biaggio's. With everything going on, I just didn't find the time to do a lot of things that I wanted to, but I was adamant about trying a new pizza place.   While looking up Biaggio's, I came across Old School Pizzeria and noticed it was much closer. We decided to save ourselves an hour of driving and we stopped in on a whim.  I took my cousin and her son, and we decided to dine in and split two large pizzas and bring any leftovers to our family.  We immediately chose the Calabrese and the Five Cheese. I like knowing that they let their dough rise for 36 hours. Awesome.  The kid that wanted CiCi's Pizza a few minutes earlier was in heaven eating Old School Pizzeria and his mind was somewhere else. He kept asking for more and more and more. Keep in mind - he is the pickiest eater I know.  I love their salame and the cheeses they put on the Five Cheese were top-notch.  We finished up, took our leftovers to everyone waiting at my Grandpa's house (aunts, uncles, grandpa, cousins, mom, dogs...you know), and they all started digging in. Apparently we didn't bring enough left overs for everyone, so my aunt called them and order two MORE pizzas for pick-up.  We returned AGAIN and this time I saw cannolis sitting on the counter, so I added 3 of those as well.  We were in a hurry, so we paid & grabbed the pizzas. When we returned, the pizzas weren't what we ordered. One of them barely had cheese and did not have the calabrese salame that we ordered. My aunt is Italian, so she keeps rolls of salame in the fridge. We sliced it and added it to the pizza ourselves. That part was disappointing. The other pizza was quite a bit smaller than the box. My aunt also ordered garlic knots...without the garlic. She's nutty.  They are becoming more popular by the second, the person making our pizzas was in training, and I'm sure they'll need to hire more people with the volume of food being ordered and made already.  I have high hopes for this place. Consistency is key. They will need to either expand or get more locations. I don't live in Vegas, but I introduced my family to this pizza place on accident, and I'm sure they will continue to order pizzas here.",

The pizza itself is pretty greasy due to the fact that it's all meat, but it still has that fresh meat taste. I had bacon on the pizza that I've never seen so thin, just melts in your mouth.   I will be returning, and I would definitely recommend them over any of the big name pizza places.",

I'm no pizza elitist, but I've had my fair share of different types of pizza, and the Classic combo was nothing special.

I've lived near Old School for almost two years and have eaten there several times. The food is always DELICIOUS. The crust is so good that you can eat it alone if you like. Their menu is superb and they offer unique toppings. My personal favorite is the Vegas Meets Italy pizza.    A couple of notes: they occasionally run out of dough or toppings. And yes, the restaurant itself is small, with just a few tables to sit at. If you want cheap, ready-made, mediocre pizza, go to Little Caesar's. For superb pizza, come to Old School Pizzeria.",

Probably bar none some of the most creative pizzas I've ever had and far and away the \"most healthy\"... beyond that the daily specials are some of the best food I've had in Vegas and that includes some very overpriced meals from strip restaurants. I'm writing a review because I hope other people get lucky enough to stumble upon what is now my favorite place to eat out. Thanks guys for good food and conversation!  As far as the menu is concerned the best part is amazing options. The favorites are always available (vegas meets italy pizza for example).  And then there are the daily specials like Osobuco or home made macaroni and cheese (five different cheeses I believe). I'm still working through the menu and just can't get enough.  I can't recommend this enough if you are in Las Vegas / North Las Vegas.",

It also seemed like they use farm to table ingredients, I saw that they use free rage chicken for their roast chicken.   So your order at the counter and then they bring the food to you. They have daily specials and the day I went they had the porchetta sandwich. It was $10 and for those don't know what it is I will explain. Porchetta is the whole pork belly with meat rolled with Italian herbs and spices then string tied and roasted till the meat is tender. It's an amazing piece of pork and hard to find. I have been longing to try this dish for a long time since I had seen it on food network. Definitely did not disappoint. They give it to you on a wooden cutting board with some au ju dip  that sandwich and it's so good. I enjoyed it more than the pizza. The bread was made in house, even though they use a sour dough culture the bread is chewy but very light and airy.  Now the pizza it was good but I like that they gave you some house made ranch dressing to dip the crust which is tasty.  I also had one of their salads the gio it was okay.  Finally I tried their house made canoli which was good.  Over all I had a good experience and definitely going back. The porchetta is only available on Wednesday as a special.  Want to try the chicken next time.",

(Most in the area suck big time, sorry I'm from NY where we know our PIZZA!)   We entered the shop which had 4 tables with tablecloths and leather chairs. A big blackboard covered one full wall with the menu written out.   So many interesting item to choose from. They have a fennel, mozz, grape/heirloom tomato and basil in a vinaigrette called Gio's Salad, It was delicious.   Then our pizza came. So far I haven't never gotten roasted whole cloves of garlic on a pizza but this one had it. It was the 14inch veggie. More heirloom tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, eggplant and more stuff. The crust was crusty!! :) and really good.   Loved the decor.   If you find yourself in the area, you must get a pizza or any of the fantastic dinner selections.. They had osso buco, roasted chicken with a savory bread pudding.. stuff just sounds great. Need to try something else next time!   Definitely a new spot for us.   NLV is finally getting some good restaurants.",

Small in size and modest in decor, the menu by Gio Mauro written in chalk with locally sourced produce and top-quality purveyors like Mary's Free Range Chickens featured prominently amidst options both classic and creative, a visit to Old School starts at the counter across from stainless-steel ovens and tempting with several individual orders plus several items to share the only question is where best to invest, my order of one appetizer, a 50/50 small Specialty Pie, and a trio of cannoli tallying just shy of $25 though a mistake in preparation would instead see two full pizzas arrive for the price of just one.  Using only naturally leavened dough, the sort which maintains great stretch and subtle yeast even when nicely charred, it was with a small order of garlic knots that the meal began and with ample butter serving to carry notes of rosemary high on the palate my original skepticism for accompanying \"ranch\" was quickly dispelled, the rich aioli far lighter than I'd ever expected...though perhaps best avoided for those on a first date as the garlic aromatics are indeed quite profound.  Having mentioned the small hiccup in my half-and-half pie it was after perhaps twenty minutes of surfing free WiFi that the first single-style pizza was served, and quickly offering to make amends with my second choice free of charge it was only at the Pizzaiolo's insistence that I finally agreed, the Regina Margherita served just fifteen minutes later and offering a whole lot of leftovers eventually gifted to a homeless man out front of Santa Fe Station en route home.  Speaking to the quality of both pies, and beginning with the crust as any great pizza should, one would be hard pressed to name a better electric fired pie outside of Dom DiMarco's, but with a crust even more crisp yet pliable plus far less 'branding' the smoky rim at Old School ups the ante substantially in both texture and taste, a similar compliment offered to boldly acidic tomato sauce virtually devoid of sugar on a Margherita that could have perhaps used a bit more time to melt the cheese, and even moreso to the sweet meets savory \"Vegas Meets Italy\" that finds fresh arugula providing an apt foil to thinly cut pork plus figs and their infused cream, the pistachios and ample ricotta rounding out textures in each hearty bite.  Limited in desserts, but offering cannolis that they proudly boast as 'filled to order' it was without hesitation that a trio was ordered and packed as if to go I assured the young cashier that such a thing would be entirely unnecessary, each crisp shell packed delicately with whipped ricotta and sweet mascarpone on par with those at Naked City for best in the city - a trio costing less than just one soggy pre-filled tube at Carlo's Bakery on the Strip.  Forgiving the mistake in my order as service recovery went well beyond what was necessary, I'll officially label myself a convert in naming Old School Pizzeria the best in a city with no lack of designer pies from which to choose.  Family owned and operated, without the benefit of a celebrity chef boasting ten ovens or an address including South Las Vegas Boulevard, Old School Pizzeria is the sort of place doing things 'right,' each hand crafted pie receiving careful attention and quality ingredients in a less than likely location well worth the drive.",

    "text": "First time here, had a warm welcome from the lady behind the counter. I just order  the monster slice + extra slice. Little did I know the monster slice is literally a \"MONSTER\" slice and I was good with just one slice, now I have lunch. Honestly the best slice of pizza I have ever had. Their dough is made the old school way, no commercial yeast, all natural leavening. Which means your pizza will be healthy & flavorful. Just a warning as well, their dough takes 36 hours of preparation time, they occasionally run out. But I can definitely tell you once you get a slice it'll be well worth it. So if your in the Las Vegas Area no matter where you are in Vegas, you must come down to old school pizzeria off of Craig and Lawrence across from the cannery casino.",

Now the food: we ordered garlic knots, two slices and I had to try their cannoli! The garlic knots are dipped in butter and have fresh basil on them, they also come with a side of house garlic sauce. They're pretty good but too fancy for me.  The pizza, though not my favorite, is pretty good! The slices are huge! The sauce is on the salty side but blends nicely in the slice.  Now the cannoli, excellent! I was pretty full after the huge slice (it's a meal in itself) but couldn't say no to a cannoli. It had a cinnamon flavor to it and was deliciously fresh!  All in Ll, I def see myself returning here.",

Next we split a pizza with cheese and sausage.  There were a number of great looking specialty pizzas but we were in the mood for an old standby.  No prerolled, frozen crusts here--everything is freshly prepared.  Rather than us my packaged yeast, the crust is made from a sourdough starter.  It has a crunchy crust with a chewy crumb, a prefect crust for a pizza.  The tomato sauce has a fresh tomato taste with a hint of basil.  In short the food was delicious!  The ambience is relaxed and casual.  Chalkboard menus on the wall tell of all the food options.  Wine and beer are available.  Highly recommended!",

And after taking the first bite of those delicious knotts we knew we had something special.  The pizza came rather quickly and of course it lived up to the hype! Scrumptious!!!

I am getting wordy here, but trust me the salad was fresh and not prebagged greens. No shortcuts. The dressing also was delicious and the crust of the pizza..., perfect! Also, the guys and lady who run the place are welcoming and clearly take pride in their food.  Great vibe, nice ambience, kick-ass pizza.",

When I get to the restaurant the manager has the nerve to lie to me and say \" I told you over the phone our pizzas are dark\" while there were 3 pizzas being cut behind him, and 2 pizzas on people's tables that looked absolutely nothing like mine . I didn't even ask for anything free to offset the delivery charge, or the inconvenience, I just wanted to exchange my pizza and get a i'm sorry about that man. Anything but a bold face lie.",

The group of brawny construction workers next to us were moaning and whining that it was too much food for them (!!!) and I MAYBE ate half of mine. Major kudos to my boyfriend who conquered his whole slice.   - The riddles on the wall. What a fun way to spend the wait for food!   - The fresh ingredients, unique combinations, and amazing flavors. My slice of pizza came with this amazing salad that had a mascarpone garlic dressing -- I still dream about that dressing, and we ate there a week ago!  - Their sizes... Tonight, we are ordering the \"OMG!\" size pie for an informal dinner party. One pizza promises to feed 5 or 6 people. Where else can you find a pizza that big that still tastes amazing?!  If you're in the area, go go go! I just adore this little place.",

    "text": "First of all, I don't care for cheese or the aroma of cheese especially melted cheese; however, I do eat pizza every now and then. It was Nat'l Pizza Day today so upon recommendation I came here.  Right off the bat I noticed the A.C. was on and no cheesy smell; reading the menu I opted for the Classic Combo plus this has extra sauce included so I don't have go thru the hassle of paying for extra sauce. OMG! All the ingredients were so fresh and  I ended up eating more half of this large pizza (5 slices). Not a pizza God but I will definitely be back with others to try other pizzas. It's always good to support local businesses who put their own spin to take it to another level. Great Job! And yes I got the exact answer for the math problem on the board without using a calculator!!!  Ha.ha.",

    "text": "So good! On our drive through Vegas to Utah we needed to stop for lunch. My husband first suggested a chain and I said no way. I knew Vegas had some hidden gems and this is one of them. We tried Old School Pizzeria based on the yelp reviews and boy they weren't wrong. We ordered quickly and didn't study the menu too much. We each had a slice of cheese (I added sausage and mushrooms) and the antipasti salad. Both were delicious. We were happy with our choices, but saw after that they had so many other awesome choices by the slice. We decided it was a great reason to come back!   Some tips:  -it's not a big place. -They do have high chairs and a changing table in the bathroom (that's was great for us, as we had our little one with us) -iced tea, while delicious, comes in a mason jar that you get to take home. I guess if you bring it back you get a discount on your next tea.  -check out the menu completely before ordering and see all the yummy choices.   Like I said we had our little so they brought our food to our table. It was very thoughtful! We will be going back for the service and the food. What a nice experience.",

    "text": "Eh, I don't really get the hype. The fact that they use sourdough for their pizza is really unique with its crunchy exterior and chewy crust, but when sourdough is the basis of almost every item on the menu it gets redundant. Our bruschetta, garlic knots, and even the bread bowl holding our salad were all made of sourdough.  Also, most of our items were bland on flavor despite clearly being made from fresh and quality ingredients, which is a shame. Worst offender was the caponata that came with the bruschetta. Bland eggplant should be a crime.    The most flavorful of our picks for the night were the whole roasted garlic cloves that came with our garlic knots. Random, I know, but they're honestly too good and better than the knots themselves. The Vegas meets Italy side of our pizza is also worthy of praise. Such a unique blend of flavors that take your tastebuds on a wild ride from the sweet fruity dates to the savory prosciutto and peppery arugula. Bravo, bravo.  Can't comment on the service because there is almost none. I'm fine with counter ordering and self service, but when I don't even get a greeting between walking in the door and waiting at the counter, that's a little sad. The guy working here looked up from his phone briefly to just utter a \"yes\" when I asked a question. Granted, they did bring half the items to our table and half smiled so the service isn't completely terrible.",

Wow fantastic thin exterior of chicken stuffed with sausage and glazed with sweet and sour sauce and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Wow is all I have to say get them they won't disappoint. And to top it off the grilled rosemary lemonade. Mmmmmm a nice touch not too sweet just what the taste buds ordered to quench your thirst. Very satisfied I will be back.",

I know lots of places have the chalk menus now but back when this place first opened they were ahead of their time.  It's a small space so you may need to order it to go if they are busy.  They have a changing variety of iced tea served in mason jars. You can take the mason jars home with you and bring it back the next visit for a discount on a refill.  They have had some unique tea flavors in the past.  They have a great lunch special that includes 1 of 3 salads, chicken wings and a slice of pizza.  Their pizza crust is delicious and crispy.  They have so many options or you can create your own pizza.  They have amazing garlic knots!  Honestly, everything on their menu is amazing. I can't wait to come back here when I'm in town again. It's right off the interstate and across from The Cannery.",

This place needs to be on your piehole's bucket list. Full order of knots and a small pie with a fountain drink, less than $24. Worth...every...penny. Go.",

    "text": "Pizza was GREAT!  Atmosphere is okay - but, hey, you're in North Las Vegas across from the Cannery in a strip mall.  What do you expect? This is a REALLY small place.  Maybe 20 seats... a couple of tables against the front window and a couple more along the side. Not comfortable seats.  Not really happy with the plastic bag tablecloths that were neither cleaned off or changed between customers. And, not too happy about the silverware sitting on the table in a cleaned out huge tomato can.  What bothered me the most was that when the pizza came out of the oven it was set on the same counter you order from to be brought to your table.  Not necessarily a big deal, you say?  Well it is if someone is standing there about to order.  My husband pushed passed someone on line to get the pizza as she approached to breath all over it and smack her purse down on the counter right next to it.  YUCK. The guy came out of the back yelling he would get it and bring it to the table, but really, guys?  C'mon.  Carry it around through the back.  No one wants everybody waiting to order breathing all over their pizza. (If not for these issues I would have given it 5 stars.)  All that aside, pizza is GREAT!... Not thing stiff, NY style, but delious sauce and cheese.  Fantastic crust. Made fresh to order.  They have take out, but I suggest you go eat it there.  My husband brought it home once and it just wasn't the same",

I ordered a slice with pepperoni & sausage. The slice was one of the best slices that I've had in a while in general; definitely a home run as far as pizza in Las Vegas. The crust was practically baked to perfection! The quest still continues... This joint moves into the Top 3 category. Until next time...",

Pizza is what they do best, but they also have other specialties worth trying.  Old School Pizzeria is a tiny hole in the wall shop. Unless you're looking for it, you'll hardly notice it while driving on Craig. There are daily specials written on a chalkboard slate that hangs from the ceiling, and one entire chalkboard menu wall. So far I've eaten here twice, and I've enjoyed everything I've ordered.   Bruschetta (4 pieces): Crunchy slices of bread topped with mozzarella and balsamic oven roasted cherry tomatoes.    Calabrese Pizza: Really, really, awesome pizza with a spicy punch. Don't doubt the spicy power of this pie, it really does have a kick to it. The toppings are Mediterranean olives, cherry and banana peppers, salami, and mozzarella cheese. I'm not a fan of olives, so I substituted them with caramelized onions. The thin slices of salami were the best I've eaten, and the crust was thin and crunchy. We were also given a side of garlicky sauce to dip our slices into.  Cannoli: Tasty, but it was a little tough to eat because it was hard to bite into.  Service - The service is quick and personable, but they do get a little annoyed if you want to swap out or omit pizza toppings -- I guess I can understand, considering how the pizzas are their masterpieces.   Overall - In short, it's the best spot to eat at on this side of town.",

The sauce is also homemade and is different than any other pizza sauce I've had in this city. It tastes like exactly like fresh tomatoes. I'm having a hard time trying to describe just how much I love this pizza (and am getting seriously hungry in the process).  The grilled rosemary lemonade is out of this world, and the white sauce that they serve with the garlic knots is also something to try. (Get it. Fall in love. Dip everything in it. Take home as much as you can.)  The service is always great, the people behind the counter are friendly, fast, and seem to enjoy what they're doing. While this is definitely a tiny, hole-in-the-wall place in a kind of strange location for the fantastic things they're doing with pizza, the ambiance inside is cute. They play a lot of Frank Sinatra and it has good lighting. Not bad.   I need to move closer to this restaurant.",

Fresh Pizza with fresh ingredients! Non commercial yeast.  Amazing Cannoli made fresh for each order... Lemonaid with fresh roasted rosemary was delightful.  Wow I can't believe this place has been here 4 years and I am just getting here...The love being shown in this resturant for the customer and food is detectable in the beautifuly prepared foods...as well as the care that is being made on the selection of what is being offered.

    "text": "Not your average pizza joint, but I wasn't super impressed either. It's a cute little place, simple decor and chalkboard menus circling the wall.   The slices are huge, probably 3x your average slice and it tasted good. My biggest complaint is that they really skimped on the toppings (which are $0.40ea) and the cheese... So its really a lot of crunchy crust. I  ordered pineapple, ham, and bacon. Pineapple was small and sparse and I got two very small/thin pieces of fatty bacon :/ . Kind of a bummer but it was definitely filling and satisfied my pizza craving!",

    "text": "Just moved to North Las Vegas and oh man is it hard to find good food in this area! So happy I got to try this place out.   FOOD: Bruschetta (5 stars): Found burrata in North Las Vegas! Whatttt? And it was AMAZING!! Basically like a burrata caprese with bread on the side.  The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the olive oil and aged balsamic had so much flavor, the heirloom tomatoes were so sweet and basil is just always good. Everything went perfectly together. I was in heaven. Just get it.  Monster slice of pizza (4 stars): Made a custom pizza slice with mushrooms, garlic, and tomatoes. The pizza is thin and crust is crunchy underneath which I liked a lot. The tomato sauce on it was really good, and the ingredients tasted fresh. The slice is huge!  Had some oil accumulating on top so I just soaked that up to be a little healthier, haha. You can do one of their specialty pizzas as a monster slice as well.   Rosemary Garlic Knots (4 stars): You can definitely taste the garlic, and there's a hint of rosemary which is good so it's not too overpowering. Comes with ranch.   SERVICE (5 stars): Everyone was so nice and really cared if we enjoyed the food.  If anything go on Tuesday for the burrata bruschetta and you will not be disappointed. Especially if you love burrata as much as me. They have other specials for the rest of the week too. Such fancy dishes for a pizza restaurant, love it. I'll definitely be coming back here.",

    "text": "This was one of those, I've heard about this place and it's close to work so let's try it out for lunch kind of visits. Wow... First of all the restaurant has this whole  Hipster meets the Godfather at a Butcher Shop kind of theme going on and I was really diggin' it. The variety of menu items is insane and I'm sure someone now has carpal tunnel from having to write them all across the menu boards.  I love pizza, no secret there. I can deal with mediocre and even bad pizza because I really do love it. So getting me to stop by a pizzeria purely based on someone else's opinion really isn't an arm twist. Like caveman discovering fire I stared at the menu in amazement but finally asked the kind smiling cashier what my best options were. It's a good thing too because a long line was forming and I think the town's folk were just about tired of the new guy. Something about torches and... Anyway I digress. She pointed towards the lunch special which was a slice of cheese pizza and a stuffed chicken wing. Let that sink in... A stuffed chicken wing. Ummmm how do you stuff a little tiny wing and do I look like the kinda guy that eats just one wing?  Curiosity peaked on the Pizza Wing combo idea I paid and retreated to a nice table near the door and anxiously awaited my selection. Being a dad I love restaurants that offer activity for kids and half of the wall in front of me was designed just for that. A giant chalk board with pink and blue sidewalk chalk for kids to express their inner Picasso. A great idea for kids I thought.  Now the pizza and wing is here and holy arm sized slice of pepperoni! The only thing slowing me down from literally diving into the plate is washing pink and blue chalk off my fingers! I don't know what magic chicken has wings this big but I'm not arguing because it was absolutely amazing. This was a magnificent display of culinary wizardry. The pizza crust was thin and perfect. I'd compare to a NY pizza crust but having never been to NY I can only compare to other pizzas I've had and this was definitely on top. The stuffed chicken wing about an inch and a half thick literally exploded with flavor in my mouth. The whole experience was definitely not what I was expecting and I just can't wait to get back with the kids and order a whole pizza. Amazing! Watch the video! <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FR-IBAtl-A2o&s=21b40ce1f37dd3c68e302596a1b08114b00140386a5158d58d7fe4d7f36d0fd2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/R-IBAtl-A2o</a>",

We ordered a large split half Regina Margherita half Pork Reighns.  They make it right in front of you and then it goes in the metal oven again right in view of the small dining room.  We were the only ones there in the late afternoon on a Tuesday, but the place started to get busy as regular dinner hours approached.  They also serve by the slice, which they call the \"Monster slice\" because it is huge.  It seems all their pizza is very thin crust so it's not excessively filling or covered in tons of cheese, but all the ingredients were quite flavorful, the sourdough crust and the fresh mozzarella was very good.",

I placed an order through their website and received a text saying they received my order.  Then I drove over.  I was a little early (they gave me an estimated completion time) so I sat and waited.  The restaurant is cute, cozy and has that \"old school\" vibe.  I could totally picture some old Italian guys sitting around, chatting and playing dominos or something.  It's very homey.   They were also playing old school tunes, it was very nice.  Brings you back to a place you only see on tv.   Brought the pizza to my sisters and shared it with my nephew and niece.  They were very impressed with the size of the slices.    The crust, oh man, the crust.  Can I say, NY?  Oh yes, closest to NYC style pizza I have had here in Vegas!!  The crust is thinner than other places that claim to have NY style pizza... it's foldable, it's tasty, it's cheesy... yes, yes, yes!!  I have found my new favorite pizza joint in Vegas!  This (very pizza snobby) NYer is happy!   The garlic knots and garlic sauce was on point with the garlic.  I was very happy that they gave quite a few of the garlic sauces - I didn't even have to ask for them.  Great service and attention to detail!   I would like to try the crispy chicken next time, it looks really good.  And I'm gonna ask for more basil too.  Ahhh so yummy!!",

I chose the Classic Combo small because I could recognize it from youth.   The taste is amazing and delicious.

The previous business located at this restaurant was a small bakery and it was pretty run down, but the new owners have really cleaned this place up and I'm really impressed. I know this place is known for their pizza, but who could resist apple-wood oven-roasted half-chicken with roasted potatoes for only $6.99? It did take a while to cook, but that just told me it wasn't sitting on a heater since that morning and it was being cooked fresh. The smell of the chicken roasting in the oven was INCREDIBLE, and when I brought it to work ALL of my co-workers said the smell was amazing. I found whole roasted garlic and rosemary in my plate, and the chicken fell off the bone. Oh man.  It's almost lunch break and I'm heading back over there in a minute to try out their pizza.

The rosemary infused knotted bread was exceptional, too, and a unique take on traditional pizzeria fare.  The only disappointing item was the cannoli.  The filling was somewhat sweet, but plain.  The addition of chopped pistachios wasn't enough flavor.  Still, it wasn't bad, but we had higher expectations after tasting the other dishes.  I highly recommend this place for casual dining or takeout.  The quality and unique style of their dishes took us pleasantly by surprise.",

Customer service was equally as poor as the pizza.  Hearing the way the couple after us was treated only confirmed the service I experienced.

I totally understand that mistakes happen, but they did nothing to rectify the error.  We were starving and bad to wait another 20 minutes for a new calzone.   In the meantime...... Our other calzone and pizza sat.  So - by the time we got home the pizza was burnt, presumably from sitting on the top of the pizza oven and the calzone was soggy and cold.  BAD!  Additionally, the canoli cream was watery and ran out of the shell.  The guy told us it was because it was just made but I have made canolis and the cream shouldn't need to set -  not sure why that was?   Overall, just disappointed.

The pizzas start off at 14\" which is what the big chains like to call a large. I personally like the \"Extra Big\" (18\"), and think the OMG (24\") is just a bit big to be practical. I recently ordered a classic combo (the traditional everything-on-it sort of pie). Nothing about this was traditional (in a good way!). The mushrooms are marinated crimini mushrooms, his peppers are roasted, and the onions are grilled.. The side effect of all this yumminess coupled with a thin crust, however is a slightly soggy pie. A small price to pay for excellence!  But let's talk about the crust! I normally don't get excited about crust ( I usually feed it to the dog!). I noticed one day in his shop that he says he uses natural leavening, and on my last order I could really tell. It tastes just like sourdough. It is super light and airy, and just the right amount of chewiness. This takes 36 hours to prep, so his signs warn that one day he might run out of dough...  In short, I'm really glad Chef Gio has come to the North side of town, and really hope to see him succeed. He is super friendly with his customers, places a tremendous amount of care into his pizzas. Why order the $10 pizza from the big guys when you can have greatness?",

    "text": "This is best pizza in town, hands down. (sorry Settebello!)  I came in here with my hubby on a weekend that we traveled to NLV. We make it to NLV every other weekend because my husband and son's barber is on Craig Rd. The last 2 times we tried to go here on a Sat, the place was closed for some odd reason. The first time their sign was being hoisted and it blocked the entrance, another time there was a personal reason. Finally, we make it on a weekend that they were open for biz.  The only bad part of this experience is that me and the fam weren't extremely hungry upon arrival. I ordered 3 slices of cheese and a side salad for 4 of us. We couldn't even eat the 3rd slice so we took it home (and I had to listen to Ray L. and Sydney B. fight over it for the next 12 hrs).  First let me address the salad. What a beautiful specimen of art and veggies!!! This salad was so deelish that I almost got too full for the pizza. When something is good most times I forget that there are other things on my plate.   The pizza is heaven. I love the dough. It is a sourdough pizza dough and I haven't had it anywhere in town, only in San Jose (whoop, whoop, Toto's!). The sauce is so spot on I could probably drink the stuff after I take a bath in it. I simply love by-the-slice places and I hope this never changes.  The other items on the menu intrigued me. It is rare that I find a pizza place offering such delicacies as roasted chicken with rosemary potatoes. This type of cuisine really puts Old School a slice above the rest. I now look forward to the NLV haircuts every other weekend. The agenda begins with pizza, then haircut/eyebrow wax, and then Epic Thrift Store. I love those kind of weekends. PERFECT~!",

Ended up trying it with my brother and dad, the place inside is rather nice and casual, the staff is knowledgable and nice but the pizza and garlic rolls are just not what I'm used to. They had way too much Rosemary that basically took away all the flavors of the pizza, we had gotten a combination. My dad got a really good pork belly sandwich which was great but this is a pizza place so I would have expected much more from the pizza. The toppings were skimpy and there was a lot of sauce. This place has great reviews but it doesn't seem special to me, maybe because the food in Vegas is just bland and that's what people are used to. Anyways nothing spectacular, too much Rosemary in everything. I wouldn't go again.",

Then a few months ago we were told about this joint.   ITS INCREDIBLE!  Everything I have tried here is divine. I love the pizza. It is the closest to how I had it in NYC. But the thing that blew my mind were the cannolis. They were just like I had them from my favorite little bakery in the Bronx. They fill them right in front of you so you know they are legit. And the cool thing is if you get the trivia question right on their chalkboard you get a free one!!   The service is great! They are usually pretty busy but you are having so much fun waiting you don't even notice.   O and I cannot explain how excited I am that a eatery as great as this one is in NORTH LAS VEGAS!   Needless to say I am in love! I crave this place more than any other. I want it right now in fact... :D",

Ordering by the slice is something I am used to at food courts inside of every mall in America. The difference is that the slices here are no joke!  One slice is enough to feed just about any person with a healthy appetite.   I opted for a slice of pepperoni and sausage. Ok--here are the positives..... The tomato sauce they use is light, flavorful, and what I have come to expect out of a good pizzeria. The dough is a good consistency and holds up without tearing or getting mushy.  What I didn't care for was the toppings they used. The pepperoni seemed cheap and greasy.   In other words, the kind of pepperoni you would find on pizza in the freezer section of your favorite grocery store. The sausage was fresh but lacked flavor. I ended up wishing I ordered a slice of cheese instead.  I will give this place another try, so I can sample the desserts that everyone talks about. The place is small and serves as a better take out place at the moment. However, it seems as though they may be renovating since the last time I was there.   I am really searching for that can't miss pizza place in Las Vegas. I have been trying for 6 years and have not been successful.  Maybe next time, it will be better. Let's hope so!",

Even the olives that were only supposed to be on half the pizza were excellent. Not the black sliced outovacan olives, but small whole wonderfully briny olives..... me thinks calamata! The pepperoni was excellent. The sausage was excellent. I had my doubts at first. I do love chunks of sausage on my pizza and the sausage on this pizza was large flat ribbons............. BUT EXCELLENT! Excellent crust. The rosemary garlic knots were........ you guessed it...... EXCELLENT! The best knots hands down we have ever had. The antipasto salad........... wait for it.......... EXCELLENT!  Other than the soda, the only real issue I have with Old School is that it is soooo far away from my home. But no doubt, moving forward, when the night, or the day for that matter, calls for the best pizza in Vegas, it's over the river and through the woods to Old School Pizza we go.  One last thing, the owner needs to keep his son away from the Magic Mike video. Although we do enjoy dinner and show from time to time, that was one show we didn't expect. That said, the owner as well as his son have something to be proud of.",

I walked in at 12:05 (five minutes after they opened and twenty five minutes ago) and they asked us to have a seat because they were short staffed. We smiled and understood, no problem. It happens. After 25 minutes they still hadn't even taken out order and four people walked in and they helped all four people before us. Terrible experience and I don't think that I'd go back. I was just sad when I left because I was really excited. Overall I thought it looked and smelled great but it just made me and my partner feed like crap that they waited on four men and made us wait until after all those people before even acknowledging our existence. Just sad.",

When I walked in the smell instantly brought me back to being on the east coast. They had a lot of different options but I kept it simple with a pepperoni, a ham and pineapple, and some garlic knots. However they did offer such toppings as: calabrese, guanciale, dates, gorgonzola, pecorino, and pesto cream. They had some specialty pizzas or you could order these items alone as toppings. Very unique creations. The chef here really seem to put his heart and soul into the food. Mom and Pop business at its finest.",

I hate giving a bad review to business owners who are try hard to put out good food and are trying to make a living...  The dough was the same,  seems to lack gluten, I have made dough in the past, and i thought the dough we produced, gave us a great crust that most of us are looking for.

Super warm, super aromatic, and of course super tasty. My coworkers were hooked already, I just smiled and told them to wait for the pizza. Once that came of course they became the addicts that I already was and I knew they would fiend for more Old School. Of course they are hooked and we've already brought plenty other coworkers here just to watch that shocked look on their face at how good everything is. On top of that, still a really outstanding staff. Really nice people, real funny, they just help give this place a nice relaxed feel.  Also to the negative reviews.

Our first time the slice was so greasy that the crust was barely crust anymore, hubby stopped in for a slice and some wings and got a dessert and brought it home didn't finish any of it and swore we'd never be back.  The past year or so friends have mentioned OSP a few times and last night we were looking for something 'new' decided to give it a try. This time was a whole new experience I ordered on line and went to pick it up pizza and them delicious balls of garlicky dough.!! Walked in and was waiting my turn in line and the pizza maker asked if I was ordering or had ordered when i gave him my name he repeated my order looked in the pizza oven and gave me an time estimate.  The estimated time when I placed the order was dang near spot on! While I waited the last couple of minutes and others came in to order or pick up you could tell that the two guys working have worked together for a while and do it well.  It was nice to hear sincere friendly chatter to themselves and to the guests. Got home and enjoyed our grub while the center of the pizza is 'floppier' than our preferred we did really enjoy it for what it is, we're just not the fold my pizza type as per normal if we were or are to be this would be the pizza that convinces us :)  Keep it up OSP :)",

I often preach about the qualities of a good pie to my husband (a Las Vegas native)- and this place makes good, quality pizza with premium ingredients. My husband and I came here for date night and LOVED everything we ate. We got the Hardcore Old School b/c we were feeling adventurous (he'd never had anchovies on pizza before =) and the Crazy Good Chicken, with the rosemary lemonade and a glass of white.  The chef was awesome and accommodating and took our questions with a smile. Cannolis were off the chain with lots of lightly sweetened cream and pistachios in a crispy sugar dusted shell. BONUS: Now my husband doesn't want to eat pizza from anywhere else! I enjoyed a new experience AND upgraded my husband's pizza game. #winningatlife!",

They were served with what I would call a garlicky ranch-like sauce, which is amazing!!! They also come with their marinara sauce on the side, which is slightly sweet.  We liked our food so much we decided to go back. The second time we created our own calzones. I especially liked the calzones! I'd recommend creating your own with your favorite toppings. We also ordered the garlic knots because of all the good reviews. I personally thought they were a bit tough to chew. Maybe we got a bad batch?!   I'd recommend them if you're looking for something different. The quality of the ingredients they use to make their pizza and calzones was evident in the taste! Prices were reasonable too!",

Good job us...thanks Yelpers...great decision. We ordered the Pork Rules pizza, the Five Cheese pizza and garlic knots.  I'm not a huge overload of meat pizza kinda girl, but the Pork Rules was delish!  From whole strips of bacon (my husband is an enormous bacon enthusiast) to the pork all the meats were tasty and plentiful.   The Five Cheese pizza, more my speed usually, was STELLAR!  I couldn't eat enough.  I wish I had a bigger stomach and my husband agreed (about both pizzas actually).  We spread the ricotta out over the slices and devoured them.  The sauce was light and flavorful and the crust was OUT OF THIS WORLD. As other Yelpers have mentioned the garlic knots were fabulous as well.  However, after noshing on the pizza, I could barely get one down. The delivery time was quite good and the food was still piping hot when it arrived. My four-year-old proclaimed \"Mom, you made a GREAT decision for dinner!\" OSP absolutely will be our new pizza destination!!",

A large cheese for the kiddos and a  large half Vegas meets Italy/ half Pork Reigns.  We also ordered a full order of the knots.  I will start with those.  The dipping sauce was delicious and the knots were good.  Ours were a little over done, but I like thinks crisp so I was pleased.  Our pizza's were good.  The crust was excellent.  There are only a few places that get the nod from me as far as crusts go.  (I am a Boston girl and we Bostonians care as much about our crust as all those New Yorkers do.) The rest of the pizza, sauce, cheeses, toppings, were just okay.  Nothing special, but good enough.  Hands down better than any chain in the valley.  It's REAL pizza, but not nearly as good as every mom and pop shop on the corners of the town I grew  up in Massachusetts.",

Dan said it was undercooked on top & Chef Gio wouldn't let him sell it if he were there.  I said if it's too dark on the bottom & undercooked on top, there's something wrong with the oven.  Dan said what did I expect with a 25 year old oven?  I took the pie home & all my guests hated it.  Half the pie was thrown away because it was burned on the bottom.  I've had pies there that I believe were the best in town.  I think the problem is Dan's attitude/ego.  So I'm not going back until Chef Gio gets Dan under control or gets a new oven.",

Absolutely delicious! Amazing dough, sauce, toppings and service. We usually go very basic on our first visit to a pizza place. So we had a 14\" pepperoni and a cannoli. It's so cool that you can see the chef work his magic. The staff is friendly and the cannoli was a yummy extra treat. They also make tea and lemonades in mason jars...love love love. Cant wait to go back and try everything else on the menu. So glad we found a new neighborhood pizza spot! Oh and they have pizza by the slice!!",

The previous customer comes back after he realizes it's not his pizza and since it's the biggest sized pizza box drops it all over the floor.  My husband asks for a refund & the the response was it's an online order so it'll take 3-5 days to go back onto your card but I can make you another one if you wait.  Really?  As someone who worked in customer service management the correct answer would be I'm so very sorry that this has happened & I will reverse the charges and make you a new pizza if you'd please wait.

Every time I was on this side of town; it was on a Sunday, and lucky me, they were closed.  Well, fate has finally worked in my favor! A Saturday at the movies gave us plenty of time to grab a slice of pizza. Yes, a slice runs a little over $4. Yet it is the size of my face! The first time I tried them, we got a regular cheese pizza. It was fantastic. The blend of cheeses gave the pie the right amount of salt. The crust was good enough to eat on its own or to use their crack \"ranch\". I am not even a fan of ranch and I liked it.  Since then I've tried the Las Vegas to Italy and the Three Cheese Pesto. Both are flavorful, but a simple pie is all that you need. Their mushroom and sausage is up there on my favorites.   Good thing a friend works up there. It is totally worth bribing him with alcohol to bring down here.",

However this poses a problem when the place is packed. Last time we went in each table was full and there was a line going out the door. The tables were dirty, silverware, lids and condiments were un-stocked and it took almost a half hour to even receive our salad. They were overwhelmed and short-staffed and it showed.  I must say that I've noticed a change since the first time we dined in about six months ago. At that time the owner was still cooking and it seemed as though there was more attention to detail. As long as the food remains delish, we will continue to choose them over any other local pizzeria. Let's keep our fingers crossed; North Las Vegas has been lacking in the good food arena for way too long.",

    "text": "After hearing all the positives about Old School Pizzeria I set off on the 7 mile drive from my office in hopes that I would find that elusive thin crust pizza quality I grew up with back east.  You enter the strip mall encased pizzeria and it is like walking into an italian pizza shop.  Rustic breads line a shelf behind the smallish counter.   The benches are stained wood.  The smell of fired crust seeps out of the ovens.  OSP uses only natural leavening ingredients in their crust and avoids artificial ingredients like Xanthan Gum.  This means if you think you need Gluten Free products, don't go to OSP.  (See their website blog for their discussion of Gluten Free).  Blackboards hang on the wall with brain teasers and messages.  In addition to the garlic knots and breads, empty Cannoli shells are piled high. The counter is made of a stone slab with chalk outlines of pizza.  A slice is drawn on the counter so you can see the size of the slice you are getting.  The staff is very friendly and willing to explain the process.  On the counter is a paper with specials.  I opted for a monster slice (smallest size) and a stuffed chicken wing.  I can't tell you what I expected from stuffed chicken wing but the description of a deboned chicken wing stuffed with sausage sounded good.  A part of me feared getting a chicken nugget with a hot dog sticking out but if we don't try new things, we cannot be pleasantly surprised.   Well, pleasantly surprised is not strong enough to describe how happy I was with the wing.  It was a large wing with a small part of the bone left in as a \"handle\".  The sausage stuffing was worth the extra wait while it was stuffed and cooked.  I could have eaten a dozen of these tender bites of delight.  I could have done without the bits of pistachio or pistachio similar substance, although it isn't a negative, I didn't think it added to it.  (for those with nut allergies be forewarned, the nuts are not mentioned in the description).  The sauce was light and flavorful but did not overpower the wonderful chicken taste with a slightly crisp skin that gave way to the italian sausage.  The pizza was flat with a crisp bottom crust and very fresh ingredients on top.  I had the homemade meatballs as my topping.  These meatballs appear to be cooked with love and care and are not too dense.  OSP doesn't skimp on the topping either so this one large slice was more than filling.  The sauce is sweet but the pizza could have used a bit more flavor.  Also, while I could definitely taste the quality of the crust, there was a slight burnt aftertaste to the thinner parts.  I did enjoy the thicker outer crust portion however.  For dessert, I opted for a cannoli.  I won't eat Cannoli's that are prestuffed for two reasons.  1) you never know how long ago they were stuffed and the filling is usually made of ingredients that have short shelf lives and 2) the shell becomes soggy.  OSP does it old school, filling the cannoli only after you order it and you can watch them do it.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  I also enjoyed the tea. They have jar's of unsweetened tropical tea and rosemary lemonade.  You pay for the tea and the jar the first time, then you keep the jar and if you bring it back the next time, your tea is 1.50 cheaper.  If you don't the jar is perfectly usable to package tea, preserves, or other items if you want to.  The tea tastes great too.  Finally, a shout out to the staff and owner(s?).  Everyone in the place was friendly and truly cared about what they were doing.  Although you can expect your pizza to take a bit longer here, you know it is because they are making sure your fresh ingredients are properly made, placed and cooked thoroughly.  The website offers some interesting cooking tips and blogs and games   The last event was October 2013 so I hope they post a new one soon.  Looking forward to doing it old school soon. (I have to, I bought the tea jar. )",

    "text": "First off: I don't like pizza. I was a delivery driver for a year and that turned me off to most pizzas forever. I hate going out to pizza places because they all taste the same to me.  So how did I end up going to Old School? It was not by choice, but I'm SO glad I happened to try it by chance. Their pizza absolutely does not taste \"the same\" as any other pizza place I've ever tried. The number one complaint I have about pizza joints is the crust. Well, Old School makes their crust themselves and it is perfectly balanced: crispy, light, flavorful, a hint of sourdough.  I had the veggie monster slice and Gio's salad. The veggie was filling, healthy, and the best part was that the variety of toppings made every bite slightly different, yet no ingredients ever clashed with each other.  Gio's salad was similar to a caprese but the addition of fennel elevated it to a complex level. I added just a tad of the garlic mascarpone sauce, but the salad hardly needed any help. My dining companion and I both strongly agreed that we will be going back to Old School soon... which is quite a shock for me, since I don't like pizza!",

We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch and it was busy, but not so much that we couldn't find a seat.  We were greeted heartily by the guys behind the counter.  I already knew from other reviews and pictures that the Rosemary Garlic Knots were a must, so we had a half order of those (6 for $2.99) plus I had a monster slice with tomatoes and mushrooms.  The $4.60 monster slice is a large slice of pizza which you can add toppings to for $.30 each or 4 or more for $1.20.  The garlic knots lived up to the hype and I would definitely come back for those again.  The pizza itself was alright; I found my slice to be a bit too greasy.  I did like the b/f's Crazy Good Chicken, which he also ordered; I'd have that again.  For a first visit, we were very happy with our food; I'll be looking forward to more of those garlicky knots and maybe a calzone the next go-round.",

It's straightforward and built with very high-quality ingredients. My wife and I got a 1/2 cheese, 1/2 pepperoni and roasted bell peppers pizza. The service was super friendly. These folks clearly like working here, and we got our food quickly. The sauce was the star of the show. It had a clear and bright tomato flavor. A lot of sauces taste mostly like salt and seasoning, but this was all tomatoes. Incredibly flavorful tomatoes. The crust was also great. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. It was cooked perfectly. Can't wait to come back. We did have a wobbly table. Every time we leaned on it at all it tipped. I'd eat this pizza sitting on a chair missing two legs, with a tree stump for a table though. But seriously, they should fix that table.",

Doughy if that makes sense I'm typically a thin crust girl so it felt a little extra on the dough side and a little easy on the cheese side but overall a good taste ..

    "text": "A little slice of comfort. Plus some (the cannoli).   Food: 9 Service: 9 Ambience: 6.5 Selection: 7  Honestly, I didn't expect much when my friend invited me to this small place off Craig Road in front of the Cannery.  And I didn't really expect much once I entered either.  But looking at the menu, I saw that this little pizzeria had character.  Yeah, topics are 50 cents more on a slice (monster slice is gigantic by the way) and a dollar more for full pizzas, but quality definitely compensates.  I was about to get two monster slices (the only slices available), but the cashier advised me that people usually can barely finish one.  Skeptical at first, he was right.  I ordered the carnivore pizza with pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, bacon, ham, and chicken and I could barely finish the crust.  Be sure to get the altered ranch dipping sauce, which is a bit more watery than usual, but certainly an unassumingly amazing complement to any pizza crust.  Aside from pizza, they also have other Italian offerings dependent on the day.  Service was exceptional. It looked like the place was running only under two people. Granted, it's a small place, seating only about 15 - 20 or so, but it was always packed during the dinner time (stayed there about 2.5 hours talking to a friend).  Environment isn't too interesting-pretty plain. But the personalities of the employees really make the place.  One of the guys there was the owner, co-founder of Nora's Italian in Vegas on Flamingo.  He really keeps the Italian spirit alive, making sure the customers are enjoying their food and their experience overall.  Music was chill, a great kick-back from the long work day. There was a small tv showing the news.  All in all, with two staff up front, the place handled itself pretty well.   Advice: Probably wouldn't come here for a formal, classy date, but would come here any other day.  Service was excellent and comforting, giving me that local business feeling you rarely see here in Vegas.  Food was mouth watering (honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten with the best crust I've ever had).  Price point-rationale.  Come!  I wasn't about to get the cannoli because the guy at the counter said it would take 30 minutes to make, but my friend and I ended up staying past that time anyways, and the place gave us two on the house.  Crisp, sweet outer shell and a hazel-nutty, cinnamon-ny filling creating a churro-like taste. Pretty satisfying end to the meal.",

First time I ever tried this place I ordered for pickup on their janky messed up \"website\". I ordered a HALF pepperoni and HALF just cheese. I wrote it in the \"special request to the chef box\" When we went in to pick it up, opened up the box, pizza covered with pepperoni. I brought it to the manager/owner's attention, I said \"I special requested half and half on the website\", the man looks at me and simply says \"No you didn't.\" Like are you f**king kidding me, no I didn't? I could not believe the blatant rudeness and ignorance. So instead he gave me two jumbo slices of cheese pizza. Whatever. We decided to try again about a week later because it was late and we we're in the area, we walk in and one of the staff members that was there last time says \"Ahhh, back again I see\", in the cockiest voice and smirk on his dumb face. Idk why but it set me off so we haven't been back since. It doesn't matter how good a places' food is, customer service is everything to me, and if your going to be a d*ck then you lose my business period.",

I ordered one for a pot luck that I was going to and the owner squared up the shape and cut it into pieces for me. Everyone raved about it, asking for the address and trying to guess the ingredients.

We walked in the front door and stood at the counter for at least five minutes before a young man finally, and hurriedly took our order. FIVE MINUTES we stood at the counter with no one in front of us and four different employees said to us, \"We'll be with you in just a minute.\" Really? Then we realized that a tech from So. NV Health District had just walked in the door. Side note: When we walked in the door there were three dirty tables that had not been cleared. So the health district lady made the crew nervous. I get that but to put us off for over five minutes? Then I noticed the \"B\" Health District placard on the wall. It's always nice to see an \"A\". Food: They forgot to put a certain ingredient on my wife's slice and delivered two slices to me when I ordered just one. I wondered why I was paying $36 for three slices of pizza and two half-orders of garlic knots. Messy restaurant, B-rating, poor service, and the pizza is no better than our all-time favorite... (un-named). Would I drive from the Northwest to Craig & Cannery Row for pizza again from Old School Pizza? No. Oh ya, the guy behind the counter told us that the owner/chef is on vacation.

    "text": "After living in Vegas for nearly a year I finally decided to stop by this place and give it a shot. The name of the place is really what got me. After having chain restaurant pizza for so long i keep an eye out for places that are different. Before i say anything else, I just want to note that this was the most friendly, welcoming and delicious piece of pizza that I've ever had. Giovanni and Darien (SP), made it a point to get my name, gave me theirs and each shook my hand with as much confidence as any person could possibly have when talking to someone else. If only every one in business was this friendly... As usual, with any new pizza place I always get plain old pepperoni pizza so that i can get the True taste of the cheese, sauce and crust. In my opinion the crust is what truly sets this pizza far above the rest. They have an amazing skill to be able to bake it in a way that keeps the bottom of the crust just crunchy enough while keeping the top sauce covered portion soft and moist. I've never had crust like it and even my favorite pizza back east lacks this trait. My best guess about the sauce is that it is \"home made\". It tastes natural in that it isn't too sweet or overly salty. It has a certain natural taste to it if that makes sense. The cheese is very flavorful and like the sauce it isn't overly sweet or salty. I don't want to forget about how awesomely hot it was when it was given to me. I ordered 2 slices which were gigantic. I ate one with a fork and knife because of their size and took the other home for later. When i got home the second piece was still piping hot. As Giovanni and Darien (sorry for any incorrect spelling) boxed my pizza, they asked me if i needed any dipping sauce. I said no and that i had ranch at home. Apparently that's not what you dip pizza in. If you ever go to this place and get the white dipping sauce it isn't ranch. Giovanni told me the long name of the sauce (which i cant remember) and said \"i would never give any one ranch, i respect pizza too much to hand that out\". Because he told me this i now believe that there are people that love their jobs. This also explains why I thought the ranch tasted different. I attributed it to a different brand, but it wasn't even ranch. It was good though. I can't give the sauce an honest review because i didn't think about it while eating it. I can say that it was at least good though. Price wise, I don't think that its that bad. I had a large fountain drink and two slices of pizza for $9.34. Like i said earlier that slices are like none that you've ever seen before. I was told that fountain drinks are half off when buying slices of pizza if that convinces you to go there. I could have fed 4 people on the two slices... The dining area is self serve. They have individually wrapped steel utensils and large paper napkins bundled together for dine in customers only. Chairs are great enough to put in the living room and watch TV. They're that comfortable in my opinion. The tables near the windows are made from what looks like reused wooden pallets which make the place interesting. One of the walls is a big chalk board with what seemed like riddles written on it. Gives you something to think about while you eat i guess.  In short, a great place to eat. If you haven't been there then you're missing out. If you have been, go again. We need to keep this special place in business because i cannot make pizza this well.",

They sell beer now and Anchor was the perfect fit with the pizza I pulled off the toppings from the board. We tried their chicken wings that are stuffed with Geo's sausage and man were they good. I took my two kids and my seventy year old ma from green bay land and for an old fashioned girl like her she LOVED IT! She could tell that everything was homemade and was loving the fresh cannolis. I was impressed that Geo's boys were doing such a quality job! A monster slice of pepperoni is enough for a teen and a five year old. I still can't solve Geo's wall puzzles without cheating.  Wow home made sauce!, it was great! Ordered the Pork Rules pizza online. Walked into the front door and there was a few people waiting for there orders, but I walked in and the owner says, \" are you Jason?, your pie is in the hole and out shortly.\" Offered a drink while I waited only 5 minutes.  Pizza looked, smelled, and tasted GREAT! Fast service, GOOD quality product, Great normal price!. I'LL BE BACK!!!  P.S. Hole in the wall joints are always better, and this is one of those!  You MUST ask why there name is Old School! You NEED TO LEARN ABOUT YEAST AND THE HISTORY OF, or if you are a wine, or beer brewer you will understand completely and realize your at the best pizza place in town!  Gio is not just a salad he is the head Chef that is in charge of chef's.  The Cannolis are freshly made I have NEVER!, NEVER!, had one fresh and thought that they were the most daft thing's on the planet earth till I had 4 of these things, now I have to run around the block due to the GREAT REAL Cannoli experience, \"they are really good!.  I have been just recently going to Old School(3-2013 4-2013) and asking the person taking my order to just make me the slice they feel fit to me...I just told that person whom ever what I liked and said make it what ever way chef's choice. EVERY TIME I had something that was tasty good full of flavor and hit the spot!  I asked one chef the convince me that anchovies can be baked on a pizza without over powering it and make it the most delicious subtle flavored piece of pie, and it was done! The BY THE SLICE is the best value and the most flavored, I can NOT eat 2 but I have crammed 2 down and couldn't eat the rest of the day. I now can say I HAVE ordered everything on the menu and never have I been disappointed.  They have a really good thing going and I hope if  they make any changes they are subtle!, and  don't do like some businesses I have seen, get greedy and end up gone.  The way I see it this pizza place has a responsibility and a public service to remain part of the community.",

She brought them to the wrong table and he quickly pulled her a aside and professionally corrected her with out causing a scene. Good price. Also it's a pizza place where you can personally get to know the employees. They're more than willing to chat if you're there by yourself or will ask how everybody is doing if you're there with your family. Only complaint is its a little small. If it were bigger he'd have more people in there at once. WAY TO GO OSP!!!!!",

The crust is over cooked nine out of ten times when we order now. I hadn't eaten here in months but I had a bad craving for their knots and mascarpone sauce. I ordered a dozen of them so I would still get a few and be able to share lol. I literally got next to NO mascarpone sauce. Guys, cmon. I've been in the restaurant business my whole life. The saucer had MAYBE a quarter of an ounce of sauce in it. Completely unacceptable. Thank goodness I had stuff in the fridge to throw an aioli together really quick. Secondly, since when do all the toppings for the vegas meets Italy pizza come on the side? I can see the arugula for sure, as that adds a great crunch when it's not wilted, but ALL THE TOOPINGS? Completely ruined the entire pizza. At least I can always count on the salad being ok. What a shame. You guys used to be the best spot in the neighborhood and I referred everyone to you for pizza. Not anymore",

    "text": "Yay! I just happen to be their 100th reviewer!  First of all, shame on me for not coming here sooner because they have been here at least a year and half in this nice location across from the Cannery Casino. Old School Pizzeria is just that. Old school. They make everything from scratch right in front of you.   I ordered the Rosemary Garlic Knots and a Monster slice of The Carnivore.   The Rosemary Garlic Knots were exquisite! I have had garlic knots before but these babies are now the standard I will judge others by. Let me describe it. Please have a bib or a napkin ready because you will be drooling. These are not your basic garlic knots. These knots are baked with actual rosemary leaves and real garlic cloves tossed in a light olive oil. I had them sit in the oven a little longer so it would make the outside even more crispy. When you take that first bite, it's comparable to one of those scenes you would see in any basic movie when somebody has a flashback and relives all those fun, awesome times, all in fast forward because by then that first bite is on its way to your stomach. Oh, and don't forget about the ranch dipping sauce that comes with it. Definitely did not come from a bottle. I assume they made it fresh because it was really creamy and made me want to drink it.  As for the monster slice of The Carnivore, the description is very fitting. If you refer to my pic, I put a pepper shaker right next to it so you can comprehend its dimensions. Now I have had good thin crust New York style pizza before, but this crust was SOURDOUGH! Now sourdough bread by itself I am into, but as the crust for the pizza? Stupendous! As you can assume by the name, it has all the meats they have available. From my recollection it had sausage, ham, chicken, pepperoni, and bacon. Usually when I get to the end crust, I just put it aside, but this crust was so good especially dipped in the ranch dressing, that it would make other sourdough bread jealous.  As an honorary mention, I gotta say that their bathroom is nicely decorated, clean, and has a fresh scent to it. It's so nice that I hope to God that none of those idiot hooligans jack it up with their sharpies and scratch things up. Memo to those low lifes: What kind of jerk are you to vandalize things and make it a sight for sore eyes? Anyways, sorry I kind of strayed off the beaten path there.  So now that you got this far in my review, I just want to reiterate one thing. Whatever you get here, make sure the Rosemary Garlic Knots is one of them. The pizza comes in a very close second because it compliments the former. Sometimes, you just gotta go old school! Old School Pizzeria that is!",

My husband likes thin pizza and pretty fussy...he loved it.  I placed a order on line and the experience was crazy good.  Fast and the smoothest take out I have ever experienced.  My order was placed and picked it up in 30 minutes.  They send you a text telling you they are pulling it out of the oven !! I was pleasantly surprised by the COZY atmosphere in the restaurant when I picked up the pizza.  I definitely will go back and eat in their restaurant.",

I can only recommend this homely restaurant to everybody looking for a real original Italian pizza.  Outstanding!",

It's not your ordinary pizzeria with items like \"date cream\" or \"scamorza\" and even a porchetta sandwich.   Garlic Mascarpone cream? Yes, thank you for this delicious creamy dip for your pizza, fingers, whatever...you'll want to take shots of this stuff.  The place is small and comfortable. We sat in front of the pizza window to watch the magic.  They cure their dough for 1.5 days to give it a natural crunchy crust. It holds up to the cheese and toppings without going limp.  The sauce is perfect. Light & fresh pear tomatoes which is not overdone.  I can't wait to come back and take my North Vegas clients to lunch here. Yelpers were right about this being a hidden gem!",

But I decided to make this my official pizza spot because of the customer service. Every time I come in the same guy (i didn't catch his name but i will ask next time) greets me with an authentic smile (whether its lunch on a sat or right before closing time). Always makes pleasant conversation. Just a really genuine guy.   Well a few visits back, I ordered the garlic knots (amazing!) and I asked for extra sauce (house made, equally AMAZING) of course he obliged. I came in again today, and he remembered my extra sauce! Its been quite a while since I ordered the knots so I really appreciate the gesture.   This is the type of place you come to for the food and the atmosphere! I love this place.",

    "text": "After stubbornly avoiding this place for several months I decided to give them a second chance, and I'm glad I did.  This restaurant is located in a tiny strip-mall on Craig & Lawrence (accross from the Cannery).   Went on Saturday 9-26-15 at about 7PM to get some pizza.    The place is kinda small but in an intimate, swanky-bistro kinda way.  The light fixtures are really cool, the lights are dimmed, there's some classy italian music playing in the background.  It's the kind of atmosphere that makes you instinctively lower your voice and act like a damn lady for a minute.  The atmosphere and food screams expensive but it's not at all.  So here's how it goes...you go up to the counter and order and they'll call you when it's ready then you go over and pick it up.  I really like their way of selling pizza by the slice.  Instead of making a ton of different pizzas and selling slices, they have cheese pizzas ready and they add the toppings you want and then pop the slice in the oven for a minute.  Genius.    $8.64 got me a slice of cheese pizza and a small garden salad.  I love that the salad came already dressed and on the same plate.  The pizza had a great crunchy bottom and a gooey top.  A bit too much sauce for my liking but that's just a personal preference. AND THEY GIVE YOU RANCH DRESSING AUTOMATICALLY!! And not just any ranch...tasty ranch like wingstop.   I tried my friend's garlic knots and I was hooked.  I don't even like rosemary but them knots are legit.  They have an almost sourdough quality to them and they're buttery and basically irresistable.  I'm pretty sure I'm in love.  When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore.",

Walking in the place is smaller than I expected, but the cashier was very nice when we approached. We already knew what we wanted from Yelp pics. We ordered the small sausage/pepperoni, stuffed wings, & garlic Knots.   Took about 5 mins for the garlic Knots which were tasty, fresh & hot. I don't think I liked the garnish on the knots tho (not sure the name of what that stuff was, but it thru the taste off). Stuffed wings came out next, they were fresh & hot too. We didn't enjoy them. The sausage it was stuffed with wasn't good. It was different & I'm glad I tried it. Then the pizza came out. I 4got to tell them well done so it wasn't as done as we like, but that was my fault. Pizza was piping hot, extra sauced. GOOD PIZZA!!!!   Place isn't 5 stars, but with the good service & good pizza they're worth 4 stars.",

We also tried their green salad which came in a bread bowl, their garlic knots and their chicken stuffed sausage wings. My boyfriend loved them and it's crazy cause there's no bone just sausage and chicken. Crazy how they did that. Service was exceptional and the restaurant has a very cool vibe to it. It's a small location but it was full of people and the prices are reasonable. Especially for the freshness and quality of everything.",

    "text": "I had bookmarked this place for months after hearing how amazing it was. Just a sidenote, I'm a huge fan of thin-crust pizza, crispy on the bottom and edges, and a sucker for a good crust. My fave crust is at pizzeria mozza--tastes like French baguette crust.   I personally wan't too fond of the garlic knots-- they were sourdough based, and though I love sourdough, I wasn't quite expecting it in a garlic knot or an Italian place, or at a pizza joint. But it had good flavor, and the sauce was to die-for.   The pizza had fresh toppings, but again, because the crust was sourdough, it didn't live up to my expectations. The crust had a nice crisp, but, I have other places that I prefer more than here.   A quaint place, and the pizza takes quite a while to get made. The prices aren't low either if you order the supreme or set specials. Would I go back? I'd give it one more shot. I also want to try other items next time, like the stuffed chicken wings.",

    "text": "As soon as I stepped into Old School Pizzeria, I knew I was going to like this place. Located on Craig across the Cannery and nestled alongside a barber shop, Old School Pizzeria is a nice surprise. The menu is written along the walls on chalkboard, the lighting fixtures that dangle above the tables adds an interesting touch, and the seating is bench-style. We were warmly greeted by the cashier who took the time to answer any questions we had about some menu items. He came off a genuine person who was passionate about food - you don't get that often.  CALZONE ($8.99): This calzone was made with love! The calzone comes stock with 3 types of cheese. Toppings are an addition $0.75. I got mine with black olives, bell peppers, and mushrooms. The smoked and ricotta cheese were amazing, and the veggies were of the high-quality artisanal variety. Served with a side of marinara sauce. I was only able to eat half.   PIZZA COMBO ($7.99): When they say Monster slices, they aren't kidding. This slice of pepperoni pizza was humongous! Thin crisp crust and perfectly cheesy. There's a few different combo options you can choose from, the mister got his with a half-order of garlic- rosemary knots. 5/5  GARLIC ROSEMARY KNOTS ($3.45): Probably the best garlic knots I've ever tasted. A half-order comes with 6 knots, each one brushed with olive oil and topped with rosemary and soft garlic cloves. You could literally spread a clove like butter on the knots. The side sauce served with knots was to die for. It wasn't ranch, but some kind of fancy sauce (the name escapes me).   I regret not coming to Old School Pizzeria sooner. This place is officially my new favorite pizza spot!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #264",

These guys are serious about running a restaurant. The Decor is traditional and modern at the same time, the staff is helpful, and the pizza might be the best in Vegas - and I've had most. The dough is perfect.  Slightly crispy and full of layered flavors, this pizza is the dominatrix of my submissive palate.  I want more!!  And I'll chew through that rubber ball to get it.  Too bad I live up in hendo.",

I am pretty sure many of you have already tasted Chef Gio's cooking already but don't even know it...Does Nora's/Nora's Wine Bar ring a bell??? Yes, Chef Gio is Nora's son, and we were very surprised he recognized us from our few visits to Nora's(Crazy Alfredo....YUM!!!!)  You can get Pasta, Salads. Paninis and Appetizers here, but  to come here and not order a pizza is a crime!  His pizzas come in 3 sizes-Large(14\"), XL(18\"), and OMG!(24\") He has a few speciality pizzas, or you can customize your own. We got a  half classic combo, and half pork rules pizza(see pictures of menu items ) which was absolutely delicious! You can even chat with Gio as he makes your pizza right in front of you. He makes his pizzas the old school way by not using any commercial yeast in his dough,( it's better for you, easier to digest, and you don't feel bloated after eating his pizzas) and it goes through a 36-hour natural leavening process before it is ready. When he's out, he's out, and you have to come back another time.  Another thing to save room for is his desserts. Cannolis($1.99 each or 3 for $5) Crisp, light , delicate, and the ricotta filling has the perfect sweetness.(\"better than my mom's\", Gio says) he also makes gelato when he has the time, and we couldn't have come at a better time. His flavor of the day? Nutella :) at $.75/ounce or $1.90 a scoop, it was definitely worth the calories! Unfortunately, they ran out of tiramisu, but that's a good reason for a return visit!  Before you go:  Old School Pizzeria is located acroos the Cannery Casino, next to the Metro PCS Store, cross streets are Craig and Lawrence  Cash Only....  Thank you Gio and Diego, we will definitely be back....ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(116/365) \"Old School Pie\"",

They have the menu on one wall, and riddles around the room. Even their pop machine has a chalk board! There are pendant lights hanging from fun pallet boxes. There are only 7 or 8 tables, just FYI.  Now to what really really matters- the food!  We got an amazing tropical passion tea in a huge mason jar. Yum!   We got garlic knots. Half order was plenty for the two of us. They came out with garlic and roast art in the bowl. And dipping sauce. Yum. But the best part was actually that they were REAL sourdough bread. No yeast!  And the pizza - same thing. This places uses no commercial yeast. They let nature do the work. And the taste is incredible!   This appears to be the same with most of their ingredients. The sausage is made in house. The cheese is real. Now I don't know the source for all their ingredients. Or their recipes. But what I had tonight was delicious. And I look forward to supporting this establishment during our time here in Las Vegas!   Edited to add: service was good. The staff was also very pleasant during our interactions.",

    "text": "I'm shocked how I have 8 friends on Yelp who rated this 5 stars. Maybe I went on a bad day??  I've been wanting to try this place for a long time since it was highly rated by friends, but unfortunately it was a disappointment. It was a 40 minute drive from my house one way, so for driving that far for food it better be good. A friend and I ordered for 2 couples and we spent $80. I think that is pretty high to feed 4 people for this casual of a restaurant where you order at the counter and sit down to wait for your food. I would be fine with the price if the food was outstanding.   Let me start with the positive-garlic knots. They were amazzzzzing! Everything about them I loved, they were perfect.   Now on to the not so good-the pizza  Carnivore Pizza-this pizza had a pretty good taste (and I hate tons of meat on pizza). It was greasy. I would never order this kind of pizza on my own but it was for my friend's hubby and my hubby. I ended up eating a slice of this one because I disliked the one I got.   5 cheese pesto- I love pesto and I love different kinds of cheese, and I love when I order this pizza at most other pizza restaurants. What happened? The taste was bland, how can pesto be bland? The pizza was so overcooked that the crust had a crunch to it. Not a slight crunch but a crispy cracker fall apart when you bite it crunch. I like when the cheese is gooey and soft on a pizza, but this was hardened if that makes sense and all the cheeses became one taste. The whole pizza was a no go for me or anyone in my group for that matter.  The pictures on yelp of this pizza look soooooo different than what I got, so I assume our pizza was just overcooked. We also ordered a slice of pizza that was around $8, can't remember the exact cost but I thought that was steep for one slice. She wanted the white anchovy pizza and it looked like fake pizza when it arrived. The plastic food look. It was weird. I think they had a slide of cheese that they had maybe baked earlier in the day and put 2 anchovies on top and maybe one other topping, but the toppings were sparse and since it obviously was not made as a whole pizza and baked with the toppings, it did not have a really unique taste since the topping were just placed on top. I like the idea of being able to order one slice of pizza of the one you want, but for the price this is too high and the pizza did not seem freshly made.   Looking back, I was trying one of the chef's specialties because I thought those would be the best. I always like to try the basic specialty for my first time before I go ordering something different at a restaurant and customizing it to what I want. Maybe I should have just customized in the first place.   My friends at the next table ordered the Pork Reigns and this was a greasy greasy pizza-did not like.   We ordered the Bruschetta with burrata (sounded soooo yummy) and paid for it, then the guy who took our order came up to us and said they don't have it. We got a different appetizer that was bread with a salty salty spread that I could not eat due to the high salt factor.   My other friend ordered an octopus salad that I tried and did not like, and neither did she or anyone else. She said it was rubbery and tough.   What also irritated me was the guy who took our order came to our table and started quickly cleaning up and grabbing things and grabbed the garlic knots in a flash before I could say anything! He stacked something on top and by then, it was ruined. I was irritated he did not ask if we were done and just assumed and took the best part of the meal away! The garlic knots!!!  I really wanted to like it!",

Antipasto salad was perfectly dressed, super fresh with multi colored cherri tomatoes, arugula, and meats. The crust is a thick, almost sour dough; crunchy on the outside, soft inside, and really flavorful. Tangy crushed tomato sauce paired perfect. I added a few toppings for $0.40 each and all were really high quality (caramelized onions, roasted eggplant, house sausage). The house pies also look incredible-I saw truffle cured egg yolks as a topping on the old school...what?! This is artisan food on a layman's budget. Also, for ranch lovers, you will like the house to be sure",

You can really tell that the chef takes pride in serving healthy, but incredibly tasty food. The pizza came with this white garlic sauce.

It's not Chicago or any bastardized pizza.  This is a New Haven style, even more so than NY, due to its lightness and flavorful crust.   I thought the prices were inexpensive and have def paid more for slop.  Small (2-3) people is around 20 bucks which includes two toppings.    Their menu is small and compact.  They have sandwiches and some chicken dishes.  Nice tap beers and a few wines.  Nice workers too!   I can't wait to try another pizza topping.",

    "text": "We stopped here for dinner at around 7pm on Christmas Eve.  It was the only non-chain place we could find open on the North side of town. We were soooo glad we found it!  For three of us, we ordered the large Gio salad ($8.99) and a large pizza ($20.75) with one half caramelized onions and roasted bell peppers and the other half house-made sausage and black olives.  The salad was absolutely yummy, and the perfect appetizer before pizza.  The Gio consists of Tomato, fennel, cucumber, onion, fresh mozzarella and a very good house-made vinaigrette.  I've never had a salad quite like it.  It was very fresh, and a wonderful combination of flavors.  I could have eaten a large one of these myself and just called it a night.  On to the pizza.  I don't usually gush about pizza, but I feel obliged to make an exception.  This pie is really special.  First, the crust is absolutely the best I've ever tasted.  It's a sourdough recipe and cooked to absolute perfection.  It's light, fluffy and wonderfully crispy in all the right places with just the right amount of chewiness.  The toppings were sublime.  I'm a vegetarian, but I snuck a little bite of the house-made sausage and it was quite superb.  The caramelized onions and roasted peppers were extremely flavorful.  The olives and fresh mozzarella were very high quality.  Service was excellent.  The man we ordered from was very friendly.  Salad arrived within just a few minutes and the pizza very soon after we finished the salad.  Price was very good for this high quality food.  Total for 3 was $36.97 including tax and tip.  They use Square for checkout, so you get a nice emailed receipt within seconds of purchase.  We arrived very hungry, and the salad and the large pizza provided us with plenty of food.  You could probably stretch it to four people and you'd have room for dessert.  This is an excellent little place to get some seriously high quality pie.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  If we're ever back in Vegas, we'll be sure to stop by.  Thank you!",

    "text": "Although this pizzeria is out in North town, the food should be the number one reason to trek here from other parts of the Valley. It's a small pizzeria tucked into a small strip mall next to an auto shop.  Once you step inside you are in a world of pizza pies of olden days. As you approach the counter you are greeted by men working recklessly at their craft. If you arrive when they are busy, you will see the older men yelling at the younger ones, \"Don't forget that cannoli!\" \"We've got more coming in!\", and they all run about behind the counter in plain view. Definitely \"old school\".   I placed an order for take out on their online ordering system (YES! I LOVE IT!). And when I arrived my pizza was nearly done. Also of note - the system will keep you updated via text message on the progress of your order.   Ordered: One Large pizza (serves 3 - 4), with half ham, and half ham + hot peppers. An order of Garlic Rosemary Bread Knots, and One Cannoli.   While I waited for my pizza I got a fountain drink, not long after the young man at the counter helped me out to my car and placed my order into my backseat for me.  When the pizza arrived at my home it was beautiful! Perfectly cooked with a thin, crispy, and somewhat chewy crust. Really, it was just that perfection of pizza crust style. Tomato sauce and cheese melded in food harmony. The ham placed on top of the pie was plentiful, and the hot peppers (red and yellow) were fresh and gave my part of the pizza that extra kick I was looking for.   Rosemary Garlic Bread Knots were unfathomably good for just being bread and some spices. The rosemary is the simple star here - changing regular old knots into a savory, aromatic eating experience.  Last - I split the Canoli in half to share with my husband (what a nice wife I am!), and it had a flaky exterior and a creamy inside. Absolutely delicious! I wish only I had gotten two instead of the one. Well, now I know for next time!",

I ordered the Regina Margherita and I liked the very thin crust on it, but it was definitely lacking some serious flavor.   I normally don't add any condiments to my pizza, but after eating this I quickly realized that it needed way more salt or some kind of seasoning to liven things up.  Overall this was not the worst pizza I've had, but it was not the best either. In all honesty I was a little bummed out to taste pizza that was pretty much flavorless.   This experience won't deter me from giving this joint another try and next time I'll make sure to try something entirely different.",

I highly recommend a combination of Garlic Knots and Gio's House Salad to wake your tastebuds and provide multiple mouthfuls of happiness. This salad is a combination of fresh Cucumber, Fennel, Caramelized White Onion, Cherry Tomatoes, Basil, and chunks of freshly made Mozzarella, tossed in a light, delicious, House Vinaigrette Dressing. Incredible!    The pizzas are covered with a variety of fresh ingredients, full of mouthwatering flavor, sitting upon a delicious House-made Tomato Sauce. The Classic Combo is a personal favorite, but you must try several pies for yourself before deciding upon your personal favorite. I will guarantee this, the freshly made, hand-tossed dough creates a wonderful crust. It is thin and crispy, but just thick enough to offer a soft bite of delectable deliciousness.  Amazing!",

As I was about to be refunded for the cannolis, one of the guys came up from the back and asked if I had 5 minutes as he was making fresh shells as we speak. My fiance would not have forgiven me if I didn't wait. Five minutes later, I was walking out with hot pizza and fresh cannolis. The staff during this time were nice and accommodating, they even gave me an extra cannoli for the trouble, score! We ordered two smalls (which are 14\"!), one with onions and the other with pepperoni and sausage. Both were fantastic and the leftovers reheated well. As for the cannolis, I am waiting for a verdict on that, but only two of the four were left by the next morning, so I assume they get a thumbs up as well. We will defititely be back!",

The proportions and quality of ingredients were superb; for instance, there was just enough sauce but not too much, plentiful veggies and toppings but not so many as to overwhelm the cheese, sauce and dough. My husband reports that his half (my half was veggie combo and his a regular combo) featured a delicious medley of sausages/meats complimenting each other and the veggies. Every ingredient tasted fresh and crust/dough had a wonderful rich aroma. Can't think of a way this pizza could have been any better.  It's easy to overlook this place (it's right across the Cannery Row casino thingy in a small, very unassuming commercial building), but very much worth finding. We stayed at City Center on the Strip and it's only about 15-20min drive from Vdara/Aria/Bellagio area to this place and we'd recommend it for other visitors. What's neat is you can see your pie prepared behind a glass \"exhibit.\"",

It was a little more than I wanted to spend but it was well worth it. I had been getting the $5.99-$10 deals at pizza fast food joints and was getting tired of it. We just ordered online, picked it up, and WOW! Super huge! We stayed simple and got pepperoni and I only ate 2 pieces. Filling, yummy, cheese that actually tastes like something and it was cooked all the way through! Have been back two more times. This is our family's new fave!",

    "text": "Iam originally from Philly, so my pizza standards are pretty high. I have no problem completely backing this entire post.    This review is long over-due. I wanted to start by saying that this is easily the best pizza I ever had. The pizza was traditional thin crust, italian style hand tossed. When Daren, or Darien, or Damon; THE OWNER. I cant remember exactly what his name is;  cooked the giant pizza that we had ordered, he did it to perfection; a little crunchy, with bubbles on the crust. PERFECT! The sauce was sweet and the addition of fresh basil really brought the whole thing together.   When looking at the menu, I can see that the owners take great pride in there products. I love the variety and different ideas for toppings.   The next time Im in town I plan to try a variety of different options; or maybe Ill just stick with the original plain cheese pie that won my heart and un-dieing devotion.   Thank you Old School Pizzeria for preserving tradition and taking such great pride in your food. Cooking is an art, and you are truly artists.",

If you are going O.M.G. better bring an army - 24 \" of heaven.  Travel from South Vegas (easy trip because Old School is just a mile north of the 15) for the Chicken - smoked first then finished to a rich, juicy delight.  Great healthy eating with a fantastic Anti-pasto salad.  We'll be back for more... ready to try the Mac n' Cheese!",

    "text": "We came here so excited to have the same amazing experience we have had in the past. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!! We walked in to not being greeted then by a nasty attitude female employee we found out that they no longer offered family meals.  Sad, but no biggie. My daughter grabbed a mason jar of lemonade that was in a bin in front of this \"nasty\" employee and sat down to look at the menu. My daughter then says her lemonade tastes weird. Initially my daughter tried to talk to this horrible woman but was blown off. So when my husband tried to explain that she didn't know it was rosemary lemonade and that our daughter did not like it we once again were answered by a nasty attitude in response.  My husband then asked to exchange it for something else and was responded to with a bothered tone telling him \"well\". Due to the obnoxiously nasty employee we paid for a lemonade we returned and are back on yelp trying to find a place to eat. No recommendations for this place anymore. Very sad, but one employee ruined  Old School Pizza for us.",
