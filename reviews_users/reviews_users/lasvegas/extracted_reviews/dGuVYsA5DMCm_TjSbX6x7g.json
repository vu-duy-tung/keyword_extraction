    "text": "This is authentic Chicago. More precisely, authentic Elmwood Park, the west suburban Italian enclave. Th Chicago-style hot dogs are dead-on & delicious. The beef sandwiches are almost as good as Johnnies - home of the best beef on Earth (in Elmwood Park, of course).   The sauteed peppers are superb; the only thing holding it back is the bread - definitely not Gonnella's, but really good anyway. If you want to know what a real Chicago Italian beef tastes like, go here. It's an experience everyone should enjoy at least once in their lifetime.",

    "text": "I'm sure there's some joke that begins with \"This New York food-snob walks into a Chicago Hotdog place....\" Well, NY & Chicago have two well-known food battles:  NY Pizza vs. Chicago Pizza & New York Hotdogs vs. Chicago Hotdogs.  You know what? Who cares which one is better, it's the most delicious food battles ever!  While I haven't found any good places for NY style hotdogs, this place makes GREAT Chicago style hotdogs.   I'm so happy this place is right down the street from me.  The second I walked in and the smell hit me, my stomach started smiling.  I was intimidated by the menu because there are so many things I want to try.  My good buddy from Chicago came with me and said it's the closest he's had to real Chicago style food he's found in Las Vegas. I ordered the Chicago Style hotdog and the Maxwell Polish Sausage(Spicy).  The lady behind the counter asked if I wanted fries, I declined, but she threw some in for me anyway.  Damn her!  I'm trying to watch my weight lol. Needless to say, everything was awesome!   The hotdog had snap, great flavor and the polish sausage was grilled with a nice amount of char on it and was just awesome.  Fries were great too.   I allow myself one day a week to eat unhealthy food and Windy City will probably be seeing me for the next two or three weeks.  I want to try the Pizza Bites, Tamales, Thin-crust Pizza and Stuffed Crust Pizza.  They have Cheli's Chili.  I'm a huge Hockey fan and that's Chris Chelios' Chili company...he was a defenseman for the Chicago Blackhawks for those not familiar.  I can't wait to try it all!",

Meat Trio Deep Dish - as good a deep dish as i have ever had outside of the actually city of chicago. I really liked it the couple times we've ordered one, only slight complaint was that the bacon was just a touch underdone, but the pie was still awesome.  3. Pizza Puffs - these are not panzerottis exactly, but they are pretty damn good.  I have yet to get with the vienna beef hotdogs here but i am sure they live up to all the other menu items.  The staff is always in a good mood and very nice.  Calling ahead to pick up orders is a breeze and they keep your info in their system so if you just wanna repeat what you had last time they already know what that was.  Highly recommend this place.  Good eats.",

They minimized or eliminated the spicy black pepper amount that was in the Italian beef back at that time and they took out the sweetness in their pizza sauce making it more like we have in Chicago.  Their hot dogs by far are the best in Las Vegas and this is supported by being VOTED #1 in the recently published LV REVIEW JOURNAL 2015 \"BEST OF LAS VEGAS\" SURVEY.  CONGRATULATIONS WC... you earned it!   Also, one of my favorites is the Italian beef and sausage combo.... It's delicious!

    "text": "One of my friends from Chicago raves about this place, and even asked me to vote for their other location on the Las Vegas Review Journal;s best hot dogs award.  That was couple of years ago, and I never voted for them because I never made to that location, but I have to agree with him now on their sister location.  When I think of Chicago foods, the first thing I that comes to mind is the SNL skit of the Mike Ditka fan's.   Just watching those guys \" Kobayashiing\" a bunch of dogs, and self-resuscitating themselves back to life after getting a massive heart attack was pretty funny.   Well, this could happen if you ate this way 24/7, 365 days a year, but what the heck....you have to treat yourself once in awhile, and why not here because it's sinfully good.  Located across the parking lot from Krispy Kream on Eastern, Windy City looks small at the door front, but once you walk in, the dining area expands to a pretty good size room.   The staff is super friendly, and I armed with my groupon deal from them...damn, it was a heck of a deal.  I'm no expert on deep dish pizza, but this pie is worth the drive.   Personally, I'm more of thin crust pizza guy, but this pie is my exception.   The crust at it thinnest area is about twice as thick as thin crust pizza, and it does need it because this pizza is packed with Meat, and cheese.   The sweet chunks of tomatoes flows with the sauce on top, and this pie is not weak hearted, because after eating two slices I was done for dinner.   It was tasty, filling, and reminded me of the old Red Lion pizza in Waikiki(back in 1990's)  From what seen on the daily special board, there always a special if your name match the name of day.   Too bad for me, my name beyond uncommon.    Oh well.  I had a few of their sandwiches on another visit, and the Chicago beef was very good, but it was the fries that impressed me.   Yeah, it that kind of place for me, because I will pound some food at this place, and become a honorary Mike Ditka disciple.     If you're from Chicago, this place is home away from home, and my go to spot for deep dish pizza in Las Vegas!",

We had the Chicago-style deep dish pizza, my half had sausage and anchovie, and my boyfriend's half had pepperoni and mushroom. Both tasted great! The sauce is nice and thick, authentic and delicious. They put it on top so all the cheese and toppings stay on the crust.  We also started our meal with the pretzels, which was a mistake. Not because they were bad, they were awesome! Nice and yeasty, just how I like. The cheese sauce was smooth and creamy with just a little black pepper. The problem was that our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we couldn't finish our pizza, no matter how hard we tried.  The hot dogs are good too, but the pizza is where it's at. The lady at the counter was also very friendly and patient while we decided what to get. We've tried a few other pizza joints but we always come back to Windy City!",

    "text": "To preface this review, please keep in mind everyone has different thoughts about what Chicago style pizza is. This review is based on what the majority of Chicagoans consider Chicago Style. First time trying pizza here. I love Chicago style. 5 stars for flavor and service on the phone. Minus 2 stars for the make up of the pizza. I do not consider this True Chicago style. Chicago style is not about how much cheese you can put in it. The cheese and sauce should be about equal. The sauce should have tomatoes that you actually may have to brush off of the top of the pizza. My pizza from here was overloaded with cheese. Very good but, not enough sauce to go with it. The depth was lower than expected. They make it look good due to the cheese pulling away from the rest of the pizza. A good show but, the make up of the pizza was poor. Flavor gets 5 stars. Very flavorful. Girl on the phone was Haley. She was fantastic!! Very nice. Very sweet. Very helpful. Also, their menu shows the largest deep dish pizza is 14 inches. Says on menu 21.50. That is until you put toppings on. I had 4 toppings plus Giardiniera and it was over 31.00. They should have prices on that page for toppings and should also say 21.50. Toppings extra ! I am guessing they have pizzas with certain toppings already added but, guess I did not look around the menu enough to find them. Overall it was a decent experience. I will continue to look for good Chicago style pizza here around Vegas /Henderson. This one was tasty, just not TRUE Chicago. Eating True Chicago style involves one of two things; a slice held in hand should be a mess or you put it on a plate and use a utensil. This can be held in the hand and eaten like any other pizza. And the crust should not be quite as thick as this one was. But, still was very good. In a pinch I may grab another from here.  Thank you Haley!",

She loves her some Windy City Beefs because she's a Chicago gal and they have the deep dish pizza here.  Plus, everything about this place screams, \"I love Chicago!\"  Sports banners, posters, pictures are all dedicated to the Windy City--duh.  Michael Jordan looked down on us from the wall as we dined. Did we eat anything remotely healthy?  No.  OK, I had bottled water, Windy City bottled water at that.  And then, there were fries and a shared Chicago deep dish pizza, half cheese and half mushroom.  But, you don't come here to eat healthy.  You come here to eat like Chicago people, which means you're committed from the start, diets be damned.  So, I thoroughly enjoyed the fries and two slices of that deep dish deliciousness--the crust is wonderful!  And then I got stuck with taking home the leftover pizza because my pal said she's on a diet--WTH?!  Guess I'm on a diet again, too.",

That being said, this pizza definitely had a good flavor. But the crust just isn't right. It only took 20 minutes which already made us skeptical because deep dish in Chicago takes 45.  I was told in Yelp Talk that it must be because of the water that they can't make it as thick and \"pastry-like\", which is a shame. But it was definitely stil good, so I don't wanna diss; I'm sure they tried their best being in the middle of the desert!   I guess I will have to order Giordano's online or go to Chicago to get it the way I want it!",

Cashier was very rude and wouldn't even give me eye contact, she was short and snappy. I ordered hot wings and fries, she did inform me that the sauce is on the side. Thank you, I then asked for them to be dipped and cooked well done crispy. Wings and fries look great but wasn't as spicy as I would like nor crispy enough. However they were good just not to my personal hot wing liking. I love hot wings",

    "text": "For being in a small strip of a larger shopping area, we were surprised by how large Windy City was on the inside.  Lots of tables, and they are spread out so you aren't on top of your fellow diners.  Also, the place was clean, from the dining area to the bathrooms to what I could see of the kitchen.    We had a medium deep dish pizza, which takes about a half hour to cook, so be advised.  We got the meat special (sausage, pepperoni, bacon, beef) and I got some hot giardinera on the side.  This pizza is, in a word, enormous.  We brought it home with us and easily had enough for a second meal.  The crust is flaky and not heavy or doughy.  It definitely contained all of the toppings, which can be an issue with this style of pizza.  The sauce is thick and flavorful, clearly homemade.  The toppings were plentiful and of good quality.  The bacon was probably my favorite, it was thick cut and you get large chunks of it, not tiny chopped up slivers.  It didn't have much heat, so the giardinera was a welcome burst of spice.    At home, heated in the oven it was just as good if not better than it was the day before.  You may balk at the price, but you get a LOT of food, and it's great quality, AND it heats up well the next day.  You can't beat that in my book.",

We added medium giardiniera and sweet peppers and had the au jus on the side. Perfection. Beyond great. Damn that was good!   Prices were fair in my opinion.

They could be a little bit friendlier at the front desk but whatever. I was reading some comments about them being rude but I just assumed they were more straightforward in Chicago. The lady doesn't give off a friendly vibe but a business vibe, and that's fine.  I love the breading/crust!  It is very thick. It reminds me of Papa Johns breadsticks which I love. The thick crust that is. I haven't tried the thin crust so I can't make comment on that. The thin crust is significantly cheaper, I believe it was like $11 for a small $18 for a small but it is enough for 3 people. Anyways, try the deep dish pizza it is good. The only other \"Chicago\" pizza I've tried is East of Chicago pizza which is actually one of my favorites. Chicago is pretty good with the pizza. Also which was kind of cool, they have a white board in the front with a name on it, and if its your name they give you a free hotdog. Just a nice thing to do I suppose. Also a good place to watch sports and they have several tvs and a projector which is located in the front.",

I went back recently for dinner with a friend.  We had a deep dish pizza a salad and some cannolis for dessert.  Oh man nothing short of amazing.  Everything was prepared nicely.  We brought it back to my place and everything was till hot and tasty.  I can not praise this place more.  If you are into deep dish pizza please go to this place, it is fantastic.",

I was not as impressed because the meat tasted gamey and it smelled like old meat. In retrospect, I should have added cheese and other fix'ins. But I don't think you should have to add sides to make the main dish taste better. Oh well, next time. Overall it was decent. Oh BTW: the fries were yummy. I asked for well-done and they obliged. I will probably go again and give it another chance and update this review.",

Their Chicago hot dogs use Vienna Beef (which is a requirement) and they are reasonably priced! They also have an amazing Gyro and Italian Beef sandwich. Everything is made to order exactly the way you want it. My favorite is the Italian Beef and Chicago Dog combo. It is the best of both worlds!  This is one of those restaurants where I want to try everything on the menu but I always order the same thing because it is amazing.  The ambiance is nice and fits the restaurant perfectly.  Best Chicago food and hot dog joint in the Henderson area!",

That's Nina for you!! I don't come here too often, but the employees here greet not only me by first name, but all their regular customers that come in. Very cool and bumped up a star for it.    Anyways like their hot dogs, the chili w/no beans are Vienna Beef brand. Authentic Chicago. I like that the chili sauce is not too spicy and not too thick or runny either.  The #3 also comes with fries in a separate paper bag. They also have pizza at this location..I still have yet to try. One of these days I'll try that corned beef rueben sandwich too!  Most menu items are under $10 for hot dogs and sandwiches. Pretty reasonable. They also still print out a monthly calendar with the daily specials, Or check out the chalkboard in front of register for specials of the day.",

    "text": "Being from Chicago this place is one of the few places that make me feel like I'm home. Food is always good and hot. Biggest reason for 4* is their prices are a little on the high side. Even Portillos is cheaper and way better quality, but Windy City helps me satisfy my cravings. I always will be back anyways! Good to see Jay's chips alive and well.  Review Update: 3*  After coming here for the last 5 years, I decided to try the thin crust pizza. Boy that was a mistake! I got a 16inch thin crust with bacon and pepperoni. Crust and sauce were solid and the best things about this pizza, but the other ingredients just tasted and looked cheap. The bacon especially was disgusting and pure chunks of pork fat, no meat at all. The grease from the pork fat took over the taste of the pizza from cooking. Made me sick feeling like I ate bacon grease only. Cheese wasn't greasy, but melted weird it seemed. I can get past that though I guess. I will not order the pizza again. Steer clear! For $23-$24 many other options out there also. I'll stick to the fries, dogs, and Italian beef and that's it. At least steer clear from the bacon if u really want pizza there. Steep up your game WCB! Use better bacon. Also seems like you hide the bacon on the pizza because it comes out under the cheese, not on top. Afraid to show the quality of the bacon? After you eat one pieces I was like it's just a small piece of fat. It's bacon you know, but every piece was like that. Stay away from their bacon if you really want a pizza there. Expecting rendered down bacon strip pieces is pretty typical to use. I suggest that. If I was eating there I would of sent back my pizza and asked for a refund or just a new plain cheese pizza. At least I wouldn't of gotten sick due to all the grease. I'm born and raised from Chicago and a food & beverage manager here in Vegas the last 5 years. Trust me!",

It's a delicious and unique take on home and I couldn't live here in this shit desert without it.   As is custom with my fav, Giordano's, I always go big with sausage and onion and I must say, as someone who drives three hours to and from Portillo's once a month, the dogs are legit good.

    "text": "I live about an hour and a half to 2 hours drive west over a large mountain from here depending on traffic.  I mentioned this to the Woman, who took my order that I was all the way from Pahrump and how much I was really looking forward to having some freshly made Chicago style pizza in a very long time.   The Frozen Deep Dish pizzas from Chicago chains that you can order online for home delivery just aren't that great in my opinion.  I ordered their large Deep Dish and the large thin crust square cut style to go and a bottle of hot Gardinera and then I left to go move my car...I had parked in a bad spot because the parking area was jam packed.  When I came back to pick up my pizzas... the lady at the counter acted oddly, even nervous in fact I thought at the time maybe It was my appearance. She told me she gave me the discount for some current coupon they were accepting that day.  I was all that's great and thank you very much...the 2 pizzas still came to just under $50 dollars in total... but I thought wow! How considerate of her.  When I got back home I was really excited about having some authentic Chicago style food....you just can't get that in this small town I poured a glass of cold beer to celebrate my extra effort of driving all that way.  The verdict:  a God Awful disappointment!!! the deep dish pizza crust was burnt so badly it left a appallingly bitter taste in my mouth a flavor that permeated the whole pizza...The thin crust as well was way over cooked...both ended up in the trash can.  I think I can see why the lady working there was so nervous and gave me a slight discount....very bad form on her part if it was done on purpose.  I wish when they realized they were badly burnt she had offered to make 2 new pizzas and just apologize for the extra wait.  However it's possible it was just a mistake, maybe she didn't know the crust was burnt since the top of the Deep Dish pizza looked great but that shows a lack of quality control at least on this occasion.  To be fair this occurred months ago and I've only been there once and maybe the food and service is normally great and accidents can happen with food.",

Been coming here since shortly after they opened, the second time I came in the older gentleman who I believe is the owner remembered me by name! WOW.   I've had several different things here. Pizza- not from Chicago but I am clearly missing out but I am fortunate to have this place for a slice of pie.  Chicken Fingers- yummy. Nothing special but above average. Chicken Finger Sandwich- This was a special one day & I loved it. Their french fries are pretty darn good too. They also have a nice selection of soda pop (yes I call it soda pop, I am from the east coast) I tried the Black Cherry soda from Dr Browns. Ammmmazing.  Nice to have options when it comes to beverages. The staff is usually pretty friendly & food never takes too long.",

Only one thing prevents me from giving this place 5 stars: that AWFUL Sammy Sosa jersey hanging on the wall.  Lose that idiot's jersey and replace it with something else.... Bang! 5 Stars!",

They took a long time so we went to the front to ask and they said they forgot our slices and they were burnt.   We were told we had to wait longer for new slices.   It was a little annoying considering we had already waited a long time.  We watched three other families get there cooked food while we waited for two slices of pizza to be heated up.  Soda is served in styrofoam cups which is a little bit of a turn off to me.  We love that they have paper towel rolls on the tables!   The pizza was really good despite the long wait for slices of pizza that were already made. I would recommend this for tasty food.   The operation needs some improvement if they want to stay competitive.   Can't wait to try more another time.",

Yes I will eat all in one day. I love a good, flaky crust. This pizza had a great crust, along with big meaty pieces of tomato. The kicker, they have giardineira. YES I love giardineira on my pies, but I wasn't in love with the brand they carry. My only complaint is the pizza could have been left in a tad longer, the sauce was on the lukewarm side. Since it is deep dish, plan to wait 45-60mins for it to cook. We passed the time by splitting a hot dog. They are pretty small, but perfect for an appetizer. I do realize I'm not in Chicago so I'm not gonna get all crazy and compare them to the real deal, but this can definitely suffice in between my trips. Try the frozen cheescake for dessert.",

I asked one of my coworkers who comes from Chicago to come with me.   What we ended up getting for $35 was ridiculous. An order of wings with fries and a large pizza with the works was too much food for two grown men. In fact, we finished the wings and barely got through a slice before tapping out. Deep dish is no joke. The crust is not dense or doughy and held up to all the moisture that the veggies released. When they say the works, they mean it. Each slice is layered with massive amounts of ingredients. Ours basically had everything from their line.   Don't worry, when you pack it up to go, it only gets better the next day.",

I was the one that greeted them, and no one replied.   When I eat hot dogs, I just like it plain. Literally just the bun and the hot dog inside. & that is the same case with my cousins. Then we'll have all the ingredients on the side to put in our hot dogs so we can control the ingredients that we want to put. But this is the ONLY hot dog place I know that can not give a PLAIN hot dog. They said they can't put it on the side when the ingredients are removable. Apparently she said that it has to be on it and I did not hear it so I came to her and told her I thought everything was on the side, so she gave off a rude vibe and said she already told me once that it has to be on the hot dog.  Needless to say no one ate the hot dogs. My cousins only ate the fries. Customer service is okay,- and the ambiance is good. I'll probably go back to try their pizzas and give it another try.",

It was nice and thick with long amazing stretching cheese with each bite. The crust was cooked perfectly and complemented the pizza perfectly. I am able to usually eat 3 or 4 slices of pizza, but I was only able to take down 2 slices of Windy City's because it was loaded nicely.

I stumbled upon Windy City while browsing Yelp (hooray!) and am I glad I found it!  Windy City is located on a nice corner with a small plaza out front. The interior is spacious and casual with Chicago memorabilia.  On to the important stuff: Chicago style deep dish pizza. Best I've tried in Las Vegas.   The crust is thick enough to hold the toppings and has an amazing buttery taste. The sauce is definitely a highlight, tangy, sweet and flavorful, next time i'll order some extra sauce to use on pasta! The cheese is creamy and tastes very fresh. If you order additional toppings you can rest assured the guys at Windy City don't hold back, they just pile the toppings! As always if you order a deep dish pizza, give it at least 10-15 more minutes than a traditional pizza. Good (and big) things take time...  The service is great, I was greeted with a smile and the staff was very pleasant to deal with.",

Waiting for the next job, the next promotion, the next relationship, the next benchmark that will forever sever gestation from the accolade, the rehearsal from the remuneration. And I was made vividly aware of this when I placed an order with Windy City Beefs N Pizza and had to wait for the Chicago style pizza delivered fresh to my door. It wasn't a long wait or anything, but I wondered, would I always be waiting? For my driver's license, for graduation, for my first real job, my wedding, my children, my mortal demise? Is it even possible to transcend?  Maybe we should embrace the now. Maybe it's time to stop longing for Summer, 2008 and seize the day in Las Vegas. Sure, the pizza is almost nothing like Chicago's Pizzaria Uno or Giordanos, but maybe that's the way life is meant to be, and the pleasures of Chicago are, like all things, ephemeral. And maybe it's time to stop waiting, stop wining that the world gave you mashed potatoes when you really wanted french fries, accept the hand you're dealt and play it like a man! And also, eat the pizza N beefs.",

There are many places that say they are chi style and are just merly imitating but not at the qualtiy of what chi style pizza and dogs are! This place seems like someone just picked it up from chicago and planted them where thery are here in vegas! The customer service is great they are friendly and they have 3 groupon offers to pick from i have bought all three nore than once, their hot wings are amazing as well! They have a thing where each day if your name is the one that's posted you get a free hotdog, i know mine will never be posted but i am okay with that...lol! They have dine in or take out, and they even have an option where you can but all the authentic stuff to make your own chi dog at home. The prices are reasonable and the quality is great. The portions are good and you feel welcomed when you are in there.",

If you are in that area you need hit that spot if you can't make it to Chicago.",

Thought it would be a great place for client needs and called the restaurant to speak with a manager or owner. Whoever answered the phone had the worst customer service personality I've ever had to deal with. She apparently wasn't a manager or owner but felt she had the authority to shoot down any business I might want to send their way. Finally she says to email and the owners or managers would call. I asked for the email address and she says go to the website. Frustrated I say thank you and hang up then call back to find out who I'm supposed to address my email to. She says \"to whoever\" and I say \"so there isn't a person with a name that can help me\" and she says \"I'm not authorized to give that information out\". I ask \"you're not authorized to give me a managers name\" and she says \"just email and if they're interested they'll have a look\". I ask if I'm bothering her by trying to send customers her way and rather than change her tone she just says \"no not at all\". Unbelievable. Will never come back. Good hot dogs aren't worth crappy service.",

I wanted a slice of pizza, but she very rudely pointed up at the menu and said that it was only available on weekdays. Sorry I couldn't see the really small print! And besides that, I think that's ridiculous to only serve slices on weekdays. And anything else I asked about, her answers were rude and short. I felt very rushed. Her attitude was terrible and it seems like she just wanted us gone, even tho it was barely busy in there. After looking at a few reviews on here, I see that a lot of other people complained about her too. You're in customer service, learn how to be polite and treat people! Also, if you hate your job so much then please consider one that isn't in customer service.",

The only negative I can point out is that the \"salad\" was not much of a salad at all--wife and I just used it as burger toppings the next day.

We decided on our order, and then we just stood there waiting for a moment. And continued to wait while the lady behind the register finished up stapling and organizing her previous tickets. When she finally said something, she was animated and friendly.   My husband chose the Italian Beef with the spiciest peppers and 'wet'; and I of course chose my 'Chicago dog, 'not' Chicago dog and fries. They came out fairly quickly. The sandwich and the hot dog were both wrapped in paper, and the fries had their own little bag, which was twisted closed.   The fries were thin, and fairly tasty but were not piping hot. My hot dog tasted like I remember them to be, and the Beef was good. Next time, he said that he would choose to have it dipped rather than just wet. This way it will be nice and messy! Yum. As I was getting ready to leave I noticed that they sell large bags of Jay's Potato Chips. Are you serious?! I could not get over there fast enough to buy a bag. The price on the bag is exactly what I paid. That right there made my whole day. I have not had those for 17 years, and they were just as I remembered them to be.",

    "text": "If you are coming to Windy City Beefs N Pizza on a day a Chicago sports team is playing, be prepared for a crowded restaurant.  I came in yesterday around noon and Da Bears were playing.  There was a big projector screen and several TVs all showing the game.  The restaurant was nearly at capacity with only a very few open seats.  It wasn't terribly rowdy but there was a fair amount of noise coming from the fans and TVs.  For these reasons I decided I would take my lunch to go.  I ordered a #10 dipped with medium giardiniera. That is to say an Italian beef sandwich dipped (submerged) in au jus (gravy I believe they call it) with added medium spice pickled vegetables.  I had a craving for one of these sandwiches for months.  It was worth the wait.  When you order a dipped sandwich, it comes out incredibly soggy.  Clearly a result of being dunked like carnival clown in a tank.  It is nearly impossible to eat.  That is if you try to eat it like a regular sandwich.  You will go through napkins like crazy as the juice drips down your arm and all over the table.  The added vegetables give a much needed crunch to this otherwise soft sandwich.  Not to mention the spice and zing of the brine.  It all comes together as something wholly desirable.  My go to sandwich from a place like this.",

Windy City serves up all those staples, plus a few extras like chicken wings and sausages.  We came in on a Saturday for lunch and they had a steady stream of customers, but we had no problem finding a table. We ordered a pepperoni thin crust, an italian beef, and a side order of fries. All were good. The beef was delicious - lean and plentiful - no fat blobs here! We ordered with cheese, sweet peppers, and giardinera (sp?), which was pretty spicy for medium. I don't think a baby like me could handle the hot. The pizza was a good, solid pie, and the leftovers tasted great the next day, too. I'll have to come back to sample the deep dish. Surprisingly, the fries were very good, sprinkled with some kind of a seasoned salt and plenty crispy. They have lots of specials, like half price Fridays (I think), 50-cent wing Wednesdays, and a couple other ones I forget. Prices are definitely reasonable - our pizza, beef, fries, and 2 drinks came to about $26. For dessert, you can go next door to Nothing Bundt Cakes or on the other side of the parking lot to Freed's. The atmosphere inside is very welcoming to families - no liquor license (at least not yet), and lots of kids running around.",

Trying to get used to the food differences here had been difficult to say the least. Finally I came across what I hoped would be a piece of home. Born and raised in Chicago I thought, great let's see what this place is about. On moving day after a very long day of moving I ordered pizza, fries and wings. This place is only 3 miles from my home and this simple order took more than 2 hours to get to my home then of course was cold! Too tired and disgusted from what was a long day of moving. I wasn't in the mood to argue and decided I will never order from here again. Then the manager called on her own to apologize the next day and offer a discount on our next orders. I said wow! That's great! Thank you. That's a really nice gesture you're saying to yourself. Well yes i5 thought so too. Then! I decided today to place my second order ever here. A deep dish pizza, half sausage/half cheese and fries. They delivered the pizza and fries, remembered who I was and said sorry we disappointed you the first. Ok, no problem. I get everything ready for us to eat our deep dish that we've been waiting an hour for (typical for deep dish), open the box and its a THIN CRUST SMALL MUSHROOM PIZZA. What is wrong with these people! Am I being punked right now??? Now after complaining to them I have to wait for another pizza to arrive so AGAIN my pizza will take 2 hours to get here. I'm done. This is just ridiculous and the cashier had the AUDACITY to say they wouldn't charge me for ANOTHER pizza. REALLY!!",

It's bigger than it looks from the outside and there were probably around a dozen people dining inside on a Sunday evening.  Woman at the counter and guy who later handed me my food were stone faced and not very welcoming. A little over $10 for a dozen wings. They came out almost instantly, which sounds good, but means they were probably sitting under heat lamps.   In the car they didn't even smell good, like old grease. They tasted a little better than they smelled, but nothing special. Came with a side of also very greasy fries. Their hot sauce is Frank's, and their medium tastes like Frank's diluted with ranch.   I may come back to try their beef sandwich or pizza, which is their main deal, but not for wings.",

You can imagine the excitement we got when this location opened up and also served PIZZA.

The pizza was delicious, and I'd like to say I am seasoned when it comes to pizza. It was clean, decorated with all types of Chicago paraphernalia and a great dining experience. Sean, Dakota and Abraham were very pleasant and we will definitely return. It's nice to go into a place that makes you feel great before and after you leave. Lastly, the Giardiniera is definitely worth writing home about. I can't wait to go before 4 pm to take advantage of the specials they have during the day (hence, slice of deep dish pizza and pop for $5 on Mondays!) or $1.50 Chicago dogs on Tuesdays! Thank you Windy City Beefs and Pizza!!!",

Price was fair and portion was good even for a big fellow like me. I loved the celery salt on the dog, it gave that extra pop to go with the tomatoes and sport peppers.

    "text": "FYI Grand Opening is today & all dine-in orders are 50% off 1/25/13 til 10pm! Why are you still reading this, go there now! This is an update for a multi meetup event on 1/17/13. If you look at the pics I posted (the ones with the signs that say what each pizza is) you will see an amazing variety of pies.   The owners Tim and Dakota were very accommodating, they met with our organizers a week prior to discuss the setup and what we expected. Even though they do not have salads on their menu, they went out of their way to provide us with a large tossed salad so we could have it served with our pizzas. Our group had it set up as \"communal style\" so we can try several different pizzas and there is something for everyone. Tim and Dakota set up some tables near the front and set it up buffet style, and brought out a couple different pizzas every 15 or 20 minutes so that the food was hot during the event.   They had plenty of tables set up for our group of 32+ people, and there was plenty of room to move around and socialize. Their waitstaff was attentive and came over several times during the course of our event to check on us. We went to the counter to order our own beverages. They also allowed us to bring in beer and wine since their liquor license is not in yet.   Everyone in the group was happy and it was a very fun time, nice atmosphere. Nice flat screens are on the walls and the room is brightly lit. Very positive feedback from all, I did not hear one complaint which is huge (because there is always one in every crowd).   Here is what we ordered: Thin Crust:  Ultimate Veggie (green pepper, onion, mushroom and tomatoes)  Sausage Classic (sausage, green pepper, mushroom, onion)  White Pizza (olive oil, ricotta, garlic, tomatoes)  Cheese  Pepperoni/Bacon  Pepperoni  Deep Dish:  Cheese [note: this was REALLY GOOD!!! Cooked perfectly, gooey cheese, delicious sauce, oh my!!!] Sausage/Onion  Meat Special (Sausage, Pepperoni, Ground Beef & Bacon)  WCBPN Loaded (Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Onions, Green Peppers & Black Olives)  Ground Beef/Mushroom  FYI they don't have the NBA or Ice package but when your sports games are on regular TV this is a great place to watch some sports. I will be back with a group to watch the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks games because it IS \"Windy City pizza!\"",

I love deep dish pizza and have been unable to find any places in Vegas that compare to the ones I've had in Chicago. Long story short, the pizza here is deceiving and should in no way be called deep dish. It is simply a normal pizza with thicker, flakier crust! The good news is that the pizzas and cannolis are made fresh because it took a while for each item to be made and brought to my table. The cannolis were ok...I've definitely had much better ones elsewhere. I guess my search for authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza continues...",

Since I checked their menu out via Yelp prior I knew exactly what we wanted to order. I ordered the # 4 which is the Vienna Chicago Dog and a 3inch Beef Sandwich which I had them dip in the au jus. Joel ordered the #10 which was a full sized Beef Sandwich dipped with sweet peppers and cheese. I brought mine home to share with my mom and Joel took his back to work. By the time I got home I had a phone call from Joel saying how epically awesome the sandwich was! The taste was truly like Chicago! The hot dog yum! The snap of the meat and the sport peppers added the perfect spice. The meat on the sandwich was thin and tender. Mmmmm we've been talking about it ever since.   Other then the long wait you can't go wrong with Windy City. I can't wait to go back to try the pizza and another sandwich. Great flavor  and huge portions are assured you in every bite!",

I'm a self proclaimed pizza snob and much to the ire of friends and family am usually not overly impressed with most others call great pizza.  That all changed this afternoon.  I'm not a fan of thin crust so a good deep dish is the way to my heart.  I've had Chicago pizza in Chicago and it's always been meh.  I came in for a single slice of the sausage deep dish but was informed that they were all sold out for the day.  They usually stop serving single slices around 4pm but in my case they sold out early (it was 3pm).  Decided to order a 12 inch sausage supreme to go.  It takes 30 min to bake but it's well worth it.  The crust was perfectly baked, light and flavorful.  The pizza was several inches deep and was loaded with onions, green peppers, mushroom, and of course big chunks of Italian sausage.  The sauce is rich and slightly sweet and has chunks of tomatoes in it.  Windy City has dine in or carryout options.  There is also outside seating.  They have an extensive menu of all foods Chicago.",

I have had the pizza and the Italian Beef Sandwich.  The sandwich was really good, but the pizza is the star.  Their sauce is delicious, and the thin, crispy crust is excellent.   The service is WAY better than I had expected from a small pizza place.  They treat the customers the way one would expect in a fine dining establishment.  They have a nice, front patio area, complete with a giant fountain. I cannot say enough about WCB&P.  I will return every time I want a great pizza, or want to impress friends from out of town.

The place has a pretty spacious eating area decorated with Chicago sports memorabilia. They also offer free hot dogs if you have their name of the day. Too bad my middle name didn't count for today's name of the day.  Their dogs are great and there's lots of combinations available if you're in the mood for a slice of pizza or Italian beef. They even offer Green River at this place too.  We took a deep dish pizza with us home and  I was stuffed after one slice. Since my mom doesn't eat meat my dad and I are gonna have a hard time finishing this thing by ourselves!  Only advice I might add is that they only have 1 or 2 ladies (who are nice) taking orders so be patient the food is worth it. :)",

I have to say that outside of Chicago, probably the best deep dish pizza place we've been to. IMO the sauce and crust are what differentiates between a good and great ddp. Their pizza tasted little 'healthier' (less heavy and greasy) than other places, even most places in Chicago. The owners are also very friendly. Just a little advice, if you're planning to dine in: It takes a good 45 minutes to cook so order ahead and enjoy.",

I was nervous when I walked in and saw catsup on the table, but was quickly comforted by the nice girl working as she told me that was for the fries. Of course I squirted said catsup in a completely separate container, not even close to the dogs, as I am American! :-) You can be sure I will be there every Vegas trip I make, but encourage others to try for themselves.

    "text": "Yes this is a pizza joint, but I was sent to review the burger as I often do, so here you go:  This particular iteration is located on Eastern just south of the 215 in your average Vegas strip mall. It's tucked in the corner behind an outdoor seating area identified with some fairly small signage. If I wasn't specifically looking for it I probably never would have seen it. The interior is filled with your standard plain pizza restaurant furniture, and fully decorated with plenty of Windy City sports team memorabilia. The menu predictably includes plenty of options involving hot dogs, pizzas, sausages, as well as burgers, wings and fingers.  I went with the #6 Windy City's Burger & Fries: \"a mouth watering 100% all beef patty with lettuce, onions, tomato & pickles. Special sauce served on sesame seed bun.\" My burger was brought to me in a red plastic basket; I've hated this choice over a plate in the past, but it turned out to be large enough to work ok this time. The bun was a bit too large for the patty that was within, but it was very flaky and fresh. The meat had almost a questionable light grey color to it, but was somewhat flavorful and cooked well. It was not quite one of those patties you'd order medium rare, but still ok. The pickles and LTO were all good; fresh and just enough of each. The special sauce was kind of salty, and I'm not sure what it was exactly. I wasn't too crazy about it, but luckily it was only present in some spots. This was a messy burger, very juicy and not dry. Overall it was decent but nothing to go out of your way for.  The fries were of the very generic frozen variety, but they were cooked so well that I still enjoyed and ate them all. They were presented in a brown paper bag; I'm not sure if this is a tradition in Chicago or something? The #6 is a very reasonable $5.95. I was charged $8.86 so I assume this included another $1.75 for the fountain drink I ordered, and is apparently not included in the meal combo pricing. For a typical strip mall pizza restaurant this was a decent burger, but I think it's the same that you would get from probably any pizza restaurant in town so I can't say its worth going out of your way for. Still, if your friends or family are demanding pizza and you feel like eating something else, it's not the worst burger in the world.",

But when you have a taste for a RealDeal Chicago Dog and cannot quench it, that quench festers -- sometimes for years at a time.  So I was off-the-wall bonkers to discover this Highly-Rated Chicago HotDoggery in the middle of Las Vegas on my last trip there.  It's RealDeal and then some, bless them.  A soft, steamed poppy seed bun filled with the perfectly steamed Vienna Frank then topped with yellow mustard, neon-green pickle relish, chopped onions, a slice of kosher pickle, sliced tomatoes and Louisiana sport peppers, all bathed in a sprinkle of celery salt.  When done properly (as done in this establishment) it truly is a meal that would be fawned over in Paris.  It's that good!  Then to ice it, they serve Chicago-style hot tamales.  They're nothing like the authentic banana leaf tamales as served in L.A., but I guarantee you they taste infinitely better.  Next time you're rolling 7's or pulling that ace to grace your 21, take a break, hop into a taxi and treat yourself to the most fabulous hot dog -- it's gourmet! -- you've ever treated your tastebuds to.",

I am adding that star back because someone did reach out to me and and said they were sorry for how i was treated. That in its self is very rare. I also loved that she did not try what most people would of done and that is offer something for free. My food was great and I never look for a handout. Thank you for reaching out to me.

I'm so glad I took the 10 mile trip. I had the Italian beef sandwich hot and dipped and it was one of the best beef sandwiches I ever had and I've eaten a ton of them in my lifetime. The place looks like most any other beef and dog place in Chicago. The sandwich was huge. Ordered the beef, fry and drink special and I think it was about $11.00. Worth every penny. Can't wait for my next Vegas trip.",

The place was packed with avid Cubs fans and about 5 TVs playing the game. The good news for me - the Cubs were in the process of beating the Giants, so I had no conflict. I shared a small deep dish pizza with my wife. Unequivocally, the best pizza I have had in Vegas. High quality cheese and delish crust. Two slices and I was stuffed. We got to bring home half the pie for dinner the next night (yes, it re-heats really well). If you are fan of Chicago style deep dish pizza (or you are a fan of the Chicago Cubs!) and are looking for an inexpensive, informal meal, this is the place to go.",

The woman who took our order was polite & went above  and beyond in service. We ordered Italian beef, a Chicago dog combo with a small beef, & a half baked pizza to go. We had to sit outside because our dog was with.  The patio area is covered & shared by the other businesses around. Shortly after sitting down the woman who took our order brought everything out to us and even gave us a free hot dog cut into little pieces for our dog. Very nice!  The beef and hot dog were great. Just like in Chicago. The thin pizza we got to finish cooking later didn't appear to be half baked but it still heated up fine without burning. Neither my husband or I liked the pizza very much. The crust was nice and thin ( which is hard to come by in Vegas) but it was very greasy and the sauce wasn't very good. I wouldn't get it again. Might go back and try a deep dish slice to see if it's any better.",

Everyone is so nice here, the owner has been in every single time I've come, you can tell that they care about their business and their customers.

Next, I thought the price was very expensive for 12 pieces of undersized overcooked wings.  Once I got them on the plate, I can tell you that the wings were some of the most tender, simply flavored and delicate wings i have had. i really enjoyed them.  The waitress also said that on Saturdays, they do wings and a pizza for a special price and on Tuesday's it is .50 per piece.  I am coming back for sure.  The sauces for the wings are mild to hot and while I really like hot sauce, the wings were so tasty, I had them mostly plain.  We came here really for the Chicago pizza.  We had the loaded pizza on a thin crust.  The pizza was cut is squares and i am told that is how it is always done in Chicago.  The pizza was great and the vegetables in this loaded pizza were some of the best, crunchy instead of soggy!  I am coming back here for the deep dish!  Besides this, they have a variety of sausages and hot dogs. I haven't tried them yet, but it sounds really good.  The only problem is that for me, it is all about wings, then pizza and hot dogs / links / sausages are the   Like I said, I will be back for the deep dish and then on a Tuesday, so I can have more wings.  GK says check it out!",

I don't know if it's some kind of \"Chicago thing\" (which is completely BS, I've been to Chicago many times and nobody acts like this) but the lady working the counter couldn't have been more annoyed with everything we did. We asked to put tables together because we had a big group...eye roll. I changed my mind about the pizza topping before she ran the order in...eye roll and attitude. I didn't decide what beer I wanted within 4 seconds...more attitude. I could keep going. Maybe she was having a bad day or maybe it's this kind of made up Chicago attitude that she perceives as charming, but it's tired and dumb and I don't get why anyone wants to eat somewhere while \"Flo\" tells you to kiss her grits. I'll take my business somewhere else. If you're willing to deal with service like this then your a better person with me.",

Not quite a loud hockey atmosphere but at the same time its chill and plenty of room to see the big screen and 4 other tvs. The owner is cool we spoke to him for awhile while his brother was in the restaraunt. Very nice gentlemen and hawks fans from Illinois! I duno the workers name but she works alot an is really nice . Also they have random free hot dog giveaways  .. They put two random names onthe board and if its yer name u get a free hot dog! One of these hawks games days  hopefully itll say \" Greg and Holly\"",

I have gotten multiple thin crusts here,  and they have always been good. I normally settle with a cheese and a sausage and pepperoni. I wish the cheese had more cheese, but it is still tastey. You can actually taste the sauce, which has good flavor, and the meats that they use have a nice flavor and don't make the pizza greasy like other places.  I tried their cannoli, which was tastey for a Chicago pizza joint. Their regular salad tasted like it was out of a salad bag kit, nothing special, but not necessarily bad either.   My only gripe is their deep dish. It is more like a Pizza Hut pan pizza, which isn't what you would want when you are expecting Chicago style deep dish. I don't plan on getting it again when I return. Other places in town like Amore Taste of Chicago makes a way better pizza with a legit deep dish crust.  Overall, a decent place to get pizza. I'll continue to buy their groupon for their thin crust, and possibly buy their other menu items, like their sandwiches, sausages, and hot dogs, when I see something that catches my eye.",

So compared to there Italian beef, Windy city had very little flavor to the beef and I also had it wet which also brought very little flavor to the Sandwich. We also got the loaded Chicago style pizza to take with us which I give 4 stars, Would have been 5 but there was sliced carrots in it. They didn't cook soft so there was a crunchy piece of carrot in every other bite. Had to be a mistake, who puts carrots in a pizza pie.

The cashier at the front counter was extremely friendly and we hit it off because she knew about my home town. It felt good walking into a piece of Chicago in the middle of the valley.  I will definitely go back although the one cook thought I was too chatty and wanted me to \"go home already\" his own words, don't know if he knew I heard him but whatever homes .... I felt like I was at home. So...with that being said I'll see you next time with my chat box .",

The atmosphere is basic and functional with lots of Chicago-bilia on the walls and if its baseball season, a Cubs game on the TV.  But the food is where this place shines.  The deep dish is every bit as good as in Chicago, and the dogs are authentic (although there is ketchup on the table!).  Even the salad is an authentic midwestern dish; iceberg lettuce and some onion, what the heck else do ya want?!  Allow 25 minutes for the pizza to cook, it is worth the wait.",

    "text": "First of all I bought a Groupon before I even try this place out but the False advertising pizza picture of a real Chicago pizza got me. Got the one for $19 that was my first mistake I made thinking this place knew what a Chicago pizza even was. Well I was right putting sauce on top of a pan crust pizza is not a Chicago pizza look at your fake picture that a real pizza.  I guess they have never even been to Chicago or tried a real Chicago pizza before. I ate 2 slices could not even find or taste the topping on it had to put ranch and Sriracha just to get it down. The cheese was questionable not even sure if it was real cheese no stringiness to it. The pizza just taste like grease with a can of tomato sauce on top. The other 6 slices in about the only thing Chicago like was the pizza box are in my garage in the trash can and that is the first time I ever threw a pizza away in my life. The salads that came with it was a joke only iceberg lettuce and 2 not ripe thin slices of tomatoes and some expired onions plus the garlic mayo they call a dressing (disgusting) that normally they charge $4 for lol food cost is about $ .55 cents per salad. I understand markup but give me a break this place is a ripe off. As far as the 2 cannolis that came with it was store bought after one bite they went in the trash also. So that was a waste of $ 19 plus the $ 1.88 tax it would have been better spent at Walmart on frozen pizza , head of lettuce , tomato and a onion. Then I could have bought a real desert and still had dollars left over. The inside of the place is not even worth mentioning or the employees either because you should never have to go inside this dump. Just buy a frozen pizza you will enjoy it more and save money too.",

Instead of looking at the entire menu which is pretty big I told her I wanted 2 hot dogs with onion and jalapeno. She said they didn't have jalapeno so I asked her what kind of toppings were available. She was very annoyed for some reason and was like relish, onion, etc etc,  and said THATS WHAT A CHICAGO DOG IS. OK I'm not from Chicago, I've never had a Chicago dog and that's not what i was asking. I also ordered 2 of the spicy sausages and again she gave me a condescending response and said polish or italian?? I work in service industry,  I completely understand that it can be annoying when people ask questions or seem stupid but this was not the case. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Anyhow the food was mediocre and with her horrible attitude I will not be back and I will surely tell others of my experience there",

The beef is a pre-cooked product as told by the person behind the counter. The great beef stands in Chicago roast their own beef and use seasonings that may vary from place to place , but have a much better flavor than what I found here. The bread which is an big part of the Beef Sandwich is a thick crusted bread that soaks up the juices without getting doughy. Not the case here. The pizza........ forgetaboutit. It is not at all real Chicago style. I grew up in a family that owned a top Pizza-aria that was well known in the area. We were in business over 60 years. My Great Grandfather was one of the first to bring Beefs and Pizza to Chicago. If you want authentic, this is not it.  If you have come to like mediocre food called Chicago Style then this is what you get.",

I used to think of Portillos (Chicago) as my favorite, but this new place knocks it out of the park.  The pizza \"looked\" delicious but I didn't order it because the beef sandwich is so big I barely finished it.  This place is really worth the moderate price for such a great meal.  I am so happy it's so close to where I live.  I heard they had another place north of the 215 for the other hungry people in the valley.    It is DELICIOUS.",

    "text": "I love this place. After moving from Chicago to Vegas about 8 years ago my family had been looking for a good Chicago eatery and we found it here.   It's sorta a whole in the wall but is actually a lot bigger then it looks. Lots of seating, never had a problem with seating even with 7 or 8 people. Lots of really awesome Chicago stuff on the walls.....except all the stupid Cubs stuff.   The menu is really good. Good size, easy to understand, and has lots of choices. I really like the Italian beef sandwich. Wet. With cheese. The roll they use is really good and doesn't fall apart till the last bite. The meat is always on point and they give you a lot. The fries that come with it, they have more to be desired. They are okay but could be better. I've also had the original Chicago Dog! It's really good, sesame seed bun, green relish, pickle spear, tomatoes. The whole package. I really really really really really like that they have Green River soda and Jays brand chips. The prices aren't bad but could be a little bit cheaper. Staff is always nice and friendly. The one weird thing is sometimes they have these specials where if your name is Tom for example they give you a free hot dog. Or if you have a birthday that month they will give you a free drink. Haha I've never had it happen to me but it sounds good!   If you are from Chicago or like Chicago food and are looking for something authentic I'd definitely suggest this place!",

The employees were calling each customer by there name, which say a lot about this establishment.  The customers come here enough to build rapport with the employees.  It was our first time here and when we approached the counter the lady was very helpful, patient, and made good suggestions.  They bring your food to your table and they checked on us to see if we needed anything.  Food was really good and served in large portions.  The have a good selection on the menu.  I will be back to try so many other things that caught my eye!!!",

We took two deep dish pizzas, and the food was pretty good, but unfortunately not as good as a real Chicago deep dish pizza which is what I was hoping to get here.  The restaurant was almost empty when we arrived (It was about 12pm) so there was absolutely no wait to be seated. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is in a strip mall and has a very large parking lot where it is very easy to find a spot. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was pretty nice and very \"Chicago\" with a lot of baseball and city references.  The price is also quite reasonable for what you get.  Overall, my experience with Windy City Beefs N Pizza was quite positive and I would recommend it if you're looking for a pretty cheap pizza on your way back to Los Angeles from the strip. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

The salads are a miss with generic iceberg, tomatoes, and little else I remember with a choice of garlic or ranch dressing. It is more like ranch with a side of lettuce than vice versa since it is too thick to drizzle. Moving on, the pizza is the star of the show!! We ordered the deep dish with pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, and onion and boy do they pile it on! Every bite has plenty of toppings and a very crispy crust on the bottom. I don't even know how this is possible when so many NY style pizza places can't even manage to keep their crusts crispy with minimal toppings. I think this pizza may be the 8th world wonder.   The cheese used is amazing. It stretches and stretches. I bet it could reach the length of the table. Last time we were here on a Tuesday, and they had 50 cent wings. The wings here are always plain and come with various sauces to dip. They are legitimate, crispy, fried to perfection wings. After our order of 8, I really contemplated getting another batch because they were great, but had to remind myself that we still had that beast of a pizza coming. Lastly, we finished off with some cannolis. Even though it looks like they're already prepared and sitting in a fridge, the shells remain crispy. This place should be called No Sog Pizzeria, because nothing here is soggy. Eveything is crispy and perfect, just the way it should be!",

I've had most everything here except the pizza and I can tell you it's all the real deal. Hot dogs, beef, Italian sausage, polish, and gyros. It's all just as good as you'd get back in Chi town.  My favorite meal here is the gyros sandwich and I'm a real stickler on this. There are several places to get gyros here in the valley, but if you want the real deal Chicago style gyros this place has it and does it right. They use real shaved off the spit gyro meat on a lightly grilled pita with onions, tomato, and tzatziki sauce- and that's it! No lettuce, olives, feta cheese, weird herbs, or funky dressings like some other places serve it. At last I've found a decent gyro in Vegas!  Also, nice people working there. Good service, Chicago sports on the TVs, and plenty of pictures and memorabilia on the walls to make you homesick.  I only wish they were closer to my house.",

I've been hearing a lot about their Deep Dish here...so that's what I ordered!  Chicago Deep Dish : Half Pepperoni / Half Italian Sausage :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-pizza-las-vegas?select=KALsdp8z4anIuvinXKOJJg#KALsdp8z4anIuvinXKOJJg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wind...</a>  The crust here is great, buttery, crispy outsides, slightly chewy insides, with a great hearty tomato sauce and tons and tons of cheese hiding inside!  This tasted much better than the \"other\" place on Durango that was highly recommended to me....so good!  But it wasn't all perfect.  The toppings tasted a bit cheap...possibly frozen or store bought?  For all the love I tasted in the crust/sauce/cheese, I expected more.  The pepperoni looked like they came out of a lunchables box, and didn't have much seasoning or flavor and no crispy consistency...soft and chewy.  Sausage was ok, but I have been jaded with other pizza places in town, with home-made house sausage that has a bunch more flavor and spice...this one was hiding in the sauce and didn't make a statement.  But everything else was great, even reheated for leftovers...the True test for great pizza!  I ate pizza for the next two days because the pie was too much!  A bit spendy...I think I spent around $18 for this 12in deep dish.  I don't mind spending good money for great food, so it wasn't a bother...just expect it.  I recommend checking it out!  I just won't be making the 45min drive again anytime soon...or just have to find the right toppings to make a legendary za!",

I will admit that I am not a fan of deep-dish pizza, favoring the Neapolitan style crust we make at home. For once I didn't get my way, being out voted 2-1 in favor of the Chicago style house specialty.      I griped that the pizza was going to take 30 minutes. I whined to my girlfriend that I didn't like deep dish. I told my best friend that his favorite football team sucked and I suspected he was gay. I stewed in the smoldering resentment of my own girlfriend and best friend betraying my superior knowledge of what constitutes good pizza.   Then it arrived.    Thick, perfectly cooked, thin wisps of motz cheese clinging for life as each slice was pulled away. In short, it was the fucking bomb. Even if you are not a deep dish fan (like myself) I would highly encourage you to try a pie from Windy City; just learn from my experience and don't say shit until you taste it.",

I was very happy to find out that Windy City opened up in literally the same area. Once you walk inside you're met with a lot of Chicago-based memorabilia adorning the walls, so it really did make me feel at home. The staff are all really nice and are always a pleasure to see whenever I visit.  Here you will not only get Chicago style dogs (made with Vienna beef, nonetheless), but also other city staples like Maxwell St. Polish sausage, Italian beef sandwiches, Davenco gyros, and even Eli's cheesecake. As expected you can get deep dish pizza, but growing up it was all about Chicago style thin crust for me and they definitely do it right here: a crispy crust and cut in squares. And one thing I like to do here is, instead of just ordering the chili cheese fries, get a basket of fries with a cup of chili on the side to use for dipping.     I find it odd how many Chicago food establishments are suddenly popping up all around Vegas. However, this place continues to be my personal favorite. And you don't have to come from the Windy City itself to enjoy this place. I've taken several people here who're unfamiliar with Chicago food and I've heard nothing but compliments. It's just a simple quaint place with a friendly atmosphere and good food, and that's all that really matters!",

The added spiced giardinera peppers gives it a nice kick.  You can get it dry too,but the   I've never been to Chicago, but I really enjoy their deep dish pizza.  It's a loud environment, with good hospitality so it sounds pretty authentic.  If you don't want to head to the strip, this is the best bet. Get it?",

The food is always great and comes out fast except for the deep dish pizza. I wish they would have timed the pizzas better but it's not a big deal. Only down fall was everyone who had the thin crust was finished and waiting on us.   Thinking of having them cater an event we are planning since the hot dogs and beef sandwiches are always consistent.",

Not even close to authentic Chicago style pizza.  Never had carrots on pizza by default. In fact, never had carrots on pizza until now. I'll opt for the frozen Home Run Inn pizza at Sprouts next time.  Atmosphere? Some interesting sports memorabilia on the walls; the tables and chairs are as cheap and uncomfortable as you can get.",

    "text": "As a Chicago-land native who moved to Vegas about 8 years ago, I'm incredibly picky about deep dish pizza and chicago dogs. So many places try to do these things and get them completely wrong, whether the pizza has too much dough on the bottom or soggy crust, or the hot dogs are missing an ingredient or prepare the hot dogs incorrectly, very few places do these Chicago staples justice.   However, Windy City actually does! While the water in vegas will cause some irregularities compared to the standard portillos or lou malnatis fare, Windy city is by far the absolute closest and best in Las Vegas for both Deep Dish pizza AND Chicago dogs.  The service is quick and pleasant, the owner is a really lovely guy, very nice and friendly, and the food is great. We even had them order all the Chicago-dog fixings for our wedding 2 years ago and they provided excellent service.  From proper crust to filling ratio on their deep dish, to the all important celery salt, sport peppers and lovely neon green relish for their chicago-dogs, they've got it all. Definitely stop by this place if you're homesick for some Chicago favorites.",

    "text": "Windy City Beefs N Pizza is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to stop for a quick bite on the east side of town.  This hot dog and pizza feels like it was picked up in Chicago and dropped off in Henderson... every time I go I feel like I'm going to step out the front door and see Wrigley field.  Their food is authentic and packed with flavor but it won't break the bank (we had the spicy polish, chili cheese dog, and a plain hot dog with two drinks for around $30.00).  The staff are friendly and attentive, but not annoying while making sure somebody checks in with your table every 10-15 minutes (drinks are self serve so you never run dry).  Now, on to the food.  I ordered the spicy polish sausage with frys which was absolutely perfect.  Served in a steamed poppy seed bun, topped with grilled onions, spicy peppers, and what I believe was a chipotle mayo, this dog checks all the boxes.  The sausage is grilled to perfection with great caramelization.   Add in the snap of the peppers when you bite into it followed with the sweetness of the grilled onions and you're on your way to comfort food heaven.  The frys come out in a brown paper bag (which I think is a cool touch) and are sliced thin.  The frys are well salted and crispy, 10 out of 10.  All in all, Windy City Beefs N Pizza is an awesome place to go for a quick bite.  We'll definitely be back in the near future.  Tip: They don't serve slices of pizza on weekends.",

BEWARE: They do not display prices for all their items. I wanted 2 corn dogs and my husband got a Chicago dog. Our total bill was $13. Holy Sheet!! We kept looking at the receipt in absolute shock. We paid because we were hungry but then went up to the desk to ask how much each corn dog was- $3.50 each. I was done, that is ridiculous to me as the corn dog was not larger or particularly more tasty to me than any other fast food joint. The menu is vast and confusing and the staff was cold to us and rushed our order. There was no one behind us so they should have left us alone to decide. Had I known this was the experience I would get I would have kept on driving.",

Delish.  Then of course there are the Chicago favorites, you can't go wrong with the traditional Chicago hot dog -CHARRED!!

While I never had the opportunity to try this item in Chicago, I was pleasantly surprised that a Chicago style eatery had opened near my house.  #13 Windy City Combo - A Chicago style Italian Beef and Sausage Sandwich Ordered this because I wanted to try an italian beef, but also wanted to try it with an Italian Sausage. Also wanted it \"extra wet\" to give it that authentic experience. The roast beef was extremely tender and flavorful with hints of garlic and spices. The italian sausage was flavorful with a little kick to it as well. And the roll was juicy due to the sandwich being dunked in a beef broth. All in all, it was a great sandwich.  I will be back to try the Chicago style Pizza, great experience here!",

    "text": "My love for pizza is no secret to anyone who talks to me for five seconds. Windy City Deep Dish is my current steady.  Five stars. really? Eff yes. The pie is perfect in my eyes. The sauce is the best pizza sauce I've had in months. Chunky, sweet, not spicy. Just perfect. The crust is crispy, yet soft in some spots and buttery. Other Deep Dish pies I've had have been entirely too doughy for my taste. Not this one. Also it's not too deep. I could eat this shit for every meal and I have....It's even good cold. My one tiny complaint about this is when you are dining in the restaurant they give you a plastic spork to eat with. I don't know if the owners have tried doing this, but it just doesn't work. Maybe they have flimzy sporks just to laugh at us. I ended up flicking the sauce all over my shirt which sucked since I was going to a party after. Yes, instead of pregaming on vodka at home (so 2010) I pregame with some deep dish pizza.  As far as the BEEF in Windy City Beefs N Pizza I can't and won't give my opinion just yet. I haven't tried it, but I am sure I will at some point. Chicago dogs are one of my favorite food groups so I will let you know whaz up when that happens.   Customer service is beyond great here. When I have dined in they check on you, but not to the point of annoying. Also, I ordered pizza to go and when I got it home I realized the crust was overdone. Seeing as though I paid $17 for a 12\" za I called the restaurant to let them know. I spoke to Dakota who happens to be one of the owners and he apologized and said he would make me a new pizza and have it delivered right away. When getting up to get the order number I spilled the god damn Ranch dressing all over my pants, feet, couch and carpet like a champ. When my new za arrived 40 minutes later it was piping hot and had two Ranch dressings in the box. The owner delivered it himself and apologized again and collected the overdone pizza to show to the staff. Customer Satisfuckinfaction.  I don't know shit if it tastes like REAL Chicago pizza and frankly I feel bad for you folks who have to compare everything to that. What I do know is it tastes amazing to me. I've had to stop myself from going back there everyday since. Please give it a shot and share the carb guilt with me pa-lease.",

They finish it with some garlic butter I think perfect! We also ordered a chili cheese tamale was not expecting how delish is was! So moist and the chili is amazing! Def going back!",

    "text": "Keeping this review short...  I have had the Italian Beef Sandwich twice, and the Foot Long Chili Dog today.   The reason for no 5? Inconsistency? The first time I had the Beef Sammie, it was GREAT. Lots of delicious beef and cheese, and peppers and that jarsomething deliciousness these Chicago people put on everything, YUM! The second time? Bland. Not impressed.   I also think they can be slow to get your order in if there is more than 1 order ahead of you. I would like to think it;s because everything is made fresh? ;)   The chili dog was good, not the best I have had to be honest, the chili cheese dog from Sonic is 10000x better LOL..  Anyway, I am new to these Chicago-style anythings, but slowly it is winning me over. :)   Try it, it;s good shit. If you know Chicago food, I'd be curious to hear your opinion.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw the photos that fellow yelper Shirley B. posted of her meals here.  They have a location on Lake Mead & Buffalo that is much closer to my house but, I noticed an event submitted by another yelper Jaime W., that they were opening this newer location and having a grand opening special where the whole day everyone got 50% off the whole total dine-in bill! How could I not help support a local business and take advantage of such a great discount?!?! The place was packed! I was so glad that we were even able to get a table. The wait for our food was almost an hour but we knew upon walking in that it was a mad house inside and wanted to wait it out. Staff came by to talk to us regularly. It was nice to see all the support this place was getting. Since I knew we were getting 50% off the whole bill I figured this was a good way to sample several things and see what I liked and didn't. Here it goes!  The \"Chicago Deep Dish Cheese Pizza\" was by far the best part of the meal. The sauce is sweet and super tasty. The crust is thick and crisp on the bottom and chewy in the middle. I would always order this! The sad part is they told us that they only make pizza at this Eastern location. The Lake Mead location makes hot dogs and sandwiches. We would make the drive to this Eastern location just for the pizza!  Next was the \"Windy City's Chicago Style Hot Dog\". This is a spot on Chicago dog people! We are talking a Vienna all beef hot dog with a steamed (makes such a difference in how the dog comes together) Vienna poppy seed bun, mustard, onion, green relish, pickle, tomato, sport peppers and celery salt. The green relish is to die for! I recommend this for sure!  I wasn't impressed with the \"Windy City's Chicago Style Italian Beef Sandwich\". It had no flavor. If any of you have ever eaten at a \"Portillo's\" or \"Al's Beef\" in Chicago then you know what  good Italian beef is and this one here at WCBNP just doesn't cut it. I am willing to give this sandwich another try though since they were so busy maybe something was off and we did order multiple things. This sandwich was no reason not to give a 5 star review still because everything else was perfect.  We tried the \"Windy City's Maxwell Polish\" and I personally liked it. My man thought it was too charred on the outside but I like mine burnt! This one is a Vienna Polish sausage and you can get it plain or spicy, we chose spicy. They steam the sausage then grill it and serve it on a Vienna poppy seed muffin with mustard, grilled onions and sport peppers.   I wanted to try their fries so I ordered the \"Full Basket Of Chili Cheese Fries\". I had them add onions. This was so good, but chili had an off flavor. Chili with no beans wasn't the issue. The fries were great.   The place is clean and I noticed someone always wiping things down.  They serve beer and wine.  You can place an order for delivery! Call to find out if you are in the delivery area! They deliver up to 5 miles from WCBNP and charge $3.00 for delivery.  Check their website for monthly specials and coupons.  They do not accept personal checks or American Express. They do accept cash, visa, discover, and master card.  Outside is plenty of seating and in the middle of the seating is a peaceful sounding waterfall. So relaxing on a nice day I bet.  Lastly, go try this place!",

That kind of stuff isn't easy to find in Las Vegas.  Food is pretty good here.  Honestly a little bit pricier than what you would be used to back home in Chicago, but hey, we're in Vegas now... what do you expect!  Chicago hot dog that I've gotten on a couple of occasions is just OK.  I have yet to try the pizza, but looks pretty good.  The thing I like most about this place though is the feel.  The place made me miss home with all the Chicago memorabilia everywhere.  Love the big old Taylor sign that they have on the wall since I spent my college years at UIC living off Roosevelt and Taylor.  I'll be coming back just so I can try more of the menu.",

They seem to follow the McDonald's method which is to boil the potato in salted water for a few minutes then fry them to a golden brown. Trust me, that salt bath makes all the difference in smell, taste, and texture vs regular cut and fried fries. But here I am going on about the fries when this is a pizza place...   There seemed to have been a large number of locals picking up lunch (always a good sign), and they do sell pizza by the slice. We ordered the Chicago Deep Dish and that baby was piled high with cheese and stewed tomatoes, the works. I have never been so full that they had to roll me out of the restaurant like Veruca Salt in Willy Wonka to have me \"dejuiced.\" Super friendly staff that made me feel welcome, I will always visit when I am in the area.",

We ordered the sandwich and you can get it 3 ways....dry, with a ladle of au jus, or the whole sandwich dipped. We opted for the ladle. Also, you can add cheese and gardinere, which we did.  I guess I should have ordered dry with au jus on side, because I did not care for the amount of juice on it. It made the bread completely soggy and we ate in and had it fresh, and it was sooooo soggy. Like, borderline gross, but the flavor was pretty good. I wasn't impressed with the gardinere at all. I thought it would be tastier, or better and it was just eh. I doubt I'd come back to this location, as it's far from me, but I would like to have that sandwich again, and I believe the have a location near Summerlin.",

As a Chicago native, I grew up with Portillo's, Johnnies Beef, Al's, and many other great Chicago Italian Beef and Hot Dog establishments; however, the King and reigning champ overall is still Portillo's, now owned by Berkshire Hathaway, where there are locations outside of Illinois and as far away as SoCal and the Phoenix area.  I've tried Windy City's Italian Beef and fries, and another time Italian Beef and Sausage combo. Good flavor to the beef, but the choice and quality of the bread just doesn't work for me. Portillo's and Johnnie's has the right bread that's just as good and the right texture whether wet/dipped or dry. The bread Windy City uses doesn't work at all if ordered dry, as it easily breaks away and falls apart, and when wet it's like mush. I'd highly recommend changing the bread to be like those offered by the establishments I've mentioned.  Also, when I was there with my lovely wife, when it was our time to place an order, the people taking our order where two women and both immediately had attitude and rolled their eyes when they saw me and my wife. I must say, this has happened many times when we lived in Chicago and toured through the Midwest; but when we moved to SoCal some years ago the attitudes of the people there were different, much more pleasant, more friendly, and not showing any visual signs of jealously, envy, racism, or hate. Since moving to Vegas, this has only occurred a few times and usually with women who felt they were attractive and had issues with the relationship between my wife and I. Well, not much different at Windy City. These women not only made both my wife and I feel uncomfortable, they caused my wife to loose her appetite and she ordered nothing. I wish this wasn't the case, but it's obvious those women working at Windy City were jealous and more than likely, racists.   Goodbye, Windy City! We tried and I even tried again hoping the food would be the defining parameter.",

They have fries that come with your hot dog (if you order them) which taste so good, that you won't even need to put ketchup! They aren't too salty, but they aren't undersalted.      They also have chicken wings which are not tossed in any sauce yet. You can request for many different sauces to dip them in. This includes, hot sauce (mild, medium, or hot), blue cheese dressing, and ranch dressing. Personally, I recommend the hot sauce.      Their service here is absolutely fantastic! The people here are kind and always in good mood. Your food comes out in a matter of 5 minutes too! I may not know much about other places, but this is my favorite place to get hot dogs, fries, and chicken wings.",

I haven't even tried the pizza yet because I'm so obsessed with the Dogs and Italian Beef Combo. Since I moved to LV, I've had a steady stream of friends visit me as they roll through town and this is one of y favorite places to take them. The ambiance is cool, the service very friendly and helpful and the food is always just excellent. If you haven't tried this, GO THERE NOW!!!",

    "text": "I came here after a staycation on the strip with my husband. He had to have a beef on the way home. We've never eaten here but we know all about the menu because we both used to live in Chicago.   As we approached the counter two young looking girls were at the register. One of them chose to give me dirty looks and whisper about me to the other girl. It was comical and sad at the same time.  I was wearing a bikini with a dress over it. There was cleavage but nothing abnormal in my opinion.  I don't have high rise boobs or anything.  It was clear that this is what she took issue with though.  I was annoyed at how blatant she was with the attitude that I didn't get any food.  I just wanted my husband to eat so we could leave. I've got no time for drama and insecure people in my life.   He had the beef with peppers.  I ate a small piece of the meat.  It tasted pretty close to Portillo's in my opinion.  He said he liked it but that they were missing the proper bread.  He thought it was too sweet and soft. He's probably absolutely correct.  My husband is 100 percent Italian and lived in Chicago all his life until four years ago. He probably had an Italian beef when he was born.   In all honesty, I most likely will not try to come here based on service.  The girls need to control themselves. I didn't see the men behind them staring or pointing so I don't think they had the right to be catty.",

Chicago style, celery salt and peppers too.   We all have our cravings whether it be sweet, sour, spicy, crunchy, fried, baked or frozen; I craved the Gold Coast Char Dog. So powerful a craving g that I actually checked flight times for SWA. Don't judge, I had lots of points and I was off work.   I've driven by Windy City here in Vegas a thousand times and never thought it was a genre of hotdog and not unique to the Gold Coast 1900 miles away but alas, it was a concept, available where ever the the snappy casing hits the steel griddle. Here it's the 18 for one Char Dog and fries or, my favorite, the 19 with two one pound Vienna Hotdogs Chi-Town style.   Unwrapped, there it lay in all its colorful splendor of red tomatoes, green relish, grey celery salt, green peppers, white onion and yellow mustard with just a twinge of black char on the pink dog.   The bite, oh that delectable, delicious reunion of tooth and palette to the juicy, meaty snap ensconced in the steamed bun and all the flavors and textures of the aforementioned. Mmmm mmmm mmmmph!!!   The chew,; so many good flavors, textures coming together in a ballet of pleasure, saliva flowing like the Hoover Dam did in the 80's.   Reunited and it tastes so good!",

    "text": "The deep dish pizza here is a serious letdown.    The last time I was in Chicago I tried a deep dish I didn't like after taking a bad recommendation.  After seeing all the highly rated reviews from people from Chicago I was seriously excited to try this place.       Here's why I didn't like the pizza: -it wasn't hot when it came to us -the dough tasted generic and store bought; it was simultaneously hard and soggy and not in the good way -the tomatoes on top were flavorless  -even with sausage and peppers, the whole thing was bland and flavorless  I will say that it had a good amount of good mozzarella.  It didn't taste like the cheap waxy stuff.  I wasn't sure I liked the service here either.  I came up to the register to place my order and I don't know...  I just didn't feel welcome.  You should want me to order multiple items and not keep cutting me off before I can.  I mean she wasn't rude but she also wasn't friendly or helpful.  If the menu says \"creamy garlic Italian\" dressing I say I want that one and you tell me you don't have Italian but I ask what is the creamy garlic Italian and you say it's creamy garlic... that doesn't help me.  In case any of you Yelpers want to know it's basically garlic mayonnaise (taste and consistency).",

We only got one dog and I think that was the big mistake because the beef sandwiches weren't that great and I don't want to judge a place with \"beef dogs\" in the title on their average beef sandwiches.  Basically beef on a hoagie. That is all and you dip it. I was underwhelmed.  The pizza pockets were good but nothing that made me go, well I will be coming back to this place soon.  THE VERDICT: Prices were low and it was the perfect amount of food to hold us over until lunch. That relish though... that is what I really liked. Otherwise this place is good not great, but give a dog a try.",

BUT, if you are just here looking for great pizza , great people , great sports and Chicago vibe, this is the place to be, it sort of has a dive bar kind of a feel.   I was recommended by a friend for their deep dish pizza! And i think it is one of their best things they have here.. maybe they have other great things like the hot dogs but i didnt try them when i was there. They do look delicious on their yelp pictures though.   I suggest you to call and order ahead for the deep dish pizza, it takes them about 30 plus minutes to make them. Three of us ladies ordered #8 the wings with fries and also a 12 inch deep dish specialty pizza.   The wings came out in about short 5 minutes, the buffalo sauce is delicious very good with the wings (and also with the pizza when that came out) the bbq sauce felt a bit tangy.     BUT look at the picture of my deep dish pizza! Not super thick bread , it was filled with lots of cheese, sausage and tomato sauce, i would say it is authentic Chicago deep dish, not those super thick bread ones you find else where here in vegas. The 12 inch can feed about three people, we still had two slices left over after the one order of wings and pizza. It is very fulfilling",

    "text": "Thanks to Michael K hosting his first UYE, I was able to experience the friendly service and awesome wings and pizza of this SE Chicago deep dished pizzeria.  The restaurant is located in a large strip mall on S.Eastern Ave and Silverado Ranch Blvd, so finding exactly where it is could be a minor challenge.  But that also meant there are plenty of parking to go around when you go.  By the time I arrived after going to WCBNP straight from work, the chicken wings were already at the table and the group was waiting for the Chi-Town deep dish pizza (which of course took longer to bake).  The wings were really good (I am not even sure what flavor wings were ordered, but that was the highlight for me.  The deep dish pizza that was brought to our table was big.  Really big.  Not sure if I could even finish it all if I was given two meals to attempt to eat it all solo.  The pizza is cut up into squares, so it is messy work eating the middle pieces.  Fork, spoon, spork, offset spatula would all be very helpful in eating this as cleanly as possible.  Having plenty of napkins to mop up the delicious oils on your hand afterward will help too.  Price was really affordable.  With our small group it was like $5 a person for the wings and pizza.  Can't beat that!  I can't see myself coming here solo to have pizza, but the wings are well worth the drive to this east side pizzeria.  Especially on Tuesdays with their $0.50 wings promo with a minimum order of 6.  Who is going to organize the next event here?",

They have hot wings, fries, pizza (both thin crust and deep dish) and sell beer by the buckets!!! Can someone please say perfection!?!?  The place is always super clean, the brightly painted walls are covered in Chicago sports teams jerseys, photos, etc. & has tv's everywhere for all to enjoy! Gets pretty crowded w/Bears fans during the games & theyve got drink/app specials & raffles goin on at this time too! Staff is always very friendly and accurate, service is speedy & smiles all around.    Its not in the best location, as its tucked in an inside corner of a strip mall kind of hidden from main roads, so look hard for this place, bc its Definately worth checkin out!",

    "text": "Pretty darn good! Once in a while I crave a deep dish slice. Deep dish here is  bit messy but pretty good. Stopped by for some takeout in the evening and got a small plain (\"cheese\") deep dish and an order of wings.  If you come here for lunch, you can get slices, in the evening hours you can only get a pie. Tuesdays are 50 cent wings and they have pretty good deals other days as well. Be sure to pick up a deal calendar if you intent on coming back.  Now to the nitty gritty, like I said the deep dish is pretty good. The dough is nice and fluffy and the edges are perfectly crusty. The pizza has chunks of sweet tomatoes and sauce on top, I prefer pizza with rather sweeter sauce so it was great for me. My bf hates to eat tomatoes and I thought he wouldn't like it but he did! He also loved the winds and came back for more the next day. The wings come in a variety of flavors but you should know that they are not tossed with the sauce. The sauce comes on the side. I though that would be a deal breaker for my bf since he is very particular about his wings but again, he loved it! His satisfaction definitely speaks to the quality of the food here.",

We were greeted by a nice lady at the counter who happily took our order of all Italian beefs with hot giardinera (so much for variety). The food came out quickly and was hot & fresh. The sandwich put me more in the mind of a higher quality Al's Beef sandwich and is probably the best I will get until I'm able to make it back to Chicago. The fries were also pretty tasty but were outshined by the sandwich, of course. Another group ordered a pizza while we were there and it looked pretty good. They menu also consisted of all the Chi-town staples like dogs, Italian sausages, gyros, and pizza puffs. I'd definitely suggest this to anyone in the area looking for some good Chicago eats.",

Each time I have called in to-go orders for several of their deep dish pizzas for my family before hitting the road to Cali. They keep very well in a hot/cold bag during the trek home and heats up just fine in the oven.   I've never been to Chicago but these are the best damn deep dish pies I've ever had. My usual is the WCBNP Loaded deep dish which comes with: Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, black olives & giardinera peppers (hot or medium). I get two pies, one with the hot giardinera peppers and one with the medium. The hot isn't super spicy but it has more kick than the medium ones and come with less green bell peppers. I believe you can also buy jars of their peppers at the front counter as well.   The cashier is always pleasant and patient over the phone as I'm placing my order. She also gave us a calendar showing us various promotions and specials. Super nice and welcoming. My food is always ready or is being finished up by the quoted pick up time. I cannot recommend this place enough to my friends and family.",

I've eaten the sausage ($18.75), and two specialty pizzas ($21.50): WCBNP and the meat lovers. All are great, but the meat lovers is my favorite. The deep dish here isn't overly thick which I love because I like a good crust to sauce to toppings ratio. They get it right. The crust is buttery and delicious; it crisps beautifully so it can support the weight of the toppings (weak crust is another pet peeve). Toppings are fresh and so many combinations are possible. And it reheats well in the oven or toaster oven.  They have 50-cent wings on Tuesdays. I've finally tried those now, too. They are meaty, never greasy, yet super crispy. My preference is the Chicago hot, with no ranch or blue cheese. It has a nice kick and it's loaded with flavor. It's nice to actually taste hot wings.  They've had awesome specials for Blackhawks games, like buy a pizza, get one free. And coming up July 4th. They'll have .99 dogs (at both locations) with a soft drink purchase. Talk about a deal!",

Love the sports memorabilia all over the walls, the Cubs, the White Sox, the Bears, the Bulls, the Black Hawks, pictures of the great landmarks of Chicago. There are a few binders filled with old memories from Chicago for you to look through but I think there were all just black and white printing from online.   I love deep dish pizza so instant 4 star.  I've already gone to Chicago and ate the good stuff a number of times but I'm far from any expert on the stuff.  A New Yorker might say MEH cause it's not NY pizza.  A Chicagoan might say MEH cause it's not as good as back home.  Honestly I'd say we're not in Chicago or New York we're in Vegas/Henderson :) Don't be offended everyone I haven't read anyone reviews but heard how some think when it comes to pizza.  I enjoyed it enough to go once on Friday that a few days later on a Monday.  It's not a fancy pizzeria that you dress up for and pay high prices.  It is just a good pizza, really the ingredients to make a pizza are literally 1/4 of the price everyone else charges for. Their deep dish is plenty filling like how a deep dish should be.  Thick, gooey, and made to be eaten with a knife and fork or hands if I was at home.  The sauce was a little too sweet for me and I would've loved to have a more buttery crust but all in all cooked properly together with some good ingredients it made a very satisfying pizza. Lots of cheese, meat, and sauce in a deep dish crust you can never go wrong.  They also made a thin crust which also wasn't that bad. They were cut into squares and about the thickness of a \"regular\" pizza. Not very thin and extra crispy like other thin crusts I've had.  Their pizzas are good especially when you get them on day where they're selling it at buy one get one free, check their calendar for daily specials.  If you don't really know what kind of pizza to order just order their WCBNP Pizza thin crust or deep dish it's a mixture of various ingredients or just keep it simple with cheese, meat, and sauce in a deep dish.  M-F during lunch they serve deep dish by the slice for $4. The slice is almost a quarter in size of the whole thing. With these try to get here early when their fresh out the oven cause it does sit and they when they warm it up it the crust might get hard.    There have 2 hotdog for $1 and often offer free Chicago dog to anyone named whatever random name they put up on the board. There's multiple large flat screen TVs throughout the restaurant for watching sports. Cheese cake on a stick. There's lots of space inside. If you want to sit outside in the shared patio with other business at night they'll setup some light to see. Good service and reasonably priced.",

First time, we had the Chicago style deep dish pizza with Italian sausage, mushroom, and onions. And oh man, SO GOOD!!! I have to tell you that I've sampled Chicago style everywhere -- from LA to SF to Chi town! And I have to say that this is on par -- if not better -- than the ones I tried in Chicago! Everything is well-balanced, cheese is OOEY-GOOEY GOODNESS, and they do not skimp on the meat. Everyone who knows pizza... knows that toppings are important, but what is equally important is the crust! And boy, this one delivers. Its soft, flavorful, yet crispy.   I can't wait to try the hotdogs and gyros next!   I recommend eating the pizza there though. I took one to go and though it was still good... it wasn't as good as when we sat there and dined in. Reheating in the oven helps a bit! But it is best right out the oven!   Also, my bf is a huge Chicago Cubs fan -- and I think we found THE spot to watch games. I love the atmosphere. Everyone is a die-hard fan of anything Chicago! It makes all games that much more fun to watch amongst Chicagonians.",

It's a utterly comfortable hang-out for lots in this neighborhood, and it's always busy- full of happy, well-fed former Chicagoans and those in the know. My faves have to be the thin pizza, the Italian beef dipped sandwiches (so so good!) and the surprise of them all, the best canolli for dessert I've ever ever had. Yes, better than Freed's in the same shopping center. The cream inside the shells seems to me..to be made with powdered sugar, so it's very smooth and silky. Just amazing! Plus, everyone who works here is so friendly and provide great service. You go, and have a happy tummy!",

It was A-OK in my book.  They do a nice job with the pizza. We used a groupon so we got a good deal. Came with two salads large pizza and two cannoli's.  We didn't realize how big that pizza was.  We were lucky to be able to take it back to the hotel b/c we had a refrigerator.  Otherwise way too much food for two people.  Could easily fead four or five people.  We didn't even take the cannoli's b/c we had too much food.  Also - I've never eaten them so I didn't want to waste the food in case I didn't like them. The place is simple but there is Chicago memorabilia everywhere.  If you're a packer or redwing fan you may not like it.  - j/k - place is pretty cool.",

No \"enjoy\" no thank you...terrible service. You just served a chef and an event planner. Guess who I WILL NOT recommend? The hot dog was good and had a nice little snap and the roll was good. It could've used more green relish, in my opinion. I'd like to try a pie, but might not return because of the service. Everyone else got a hello, a thank you, a \"what part of Chicago are you from?\" We stood at the counter, looking at the menu and my associate was saying he'd like a dog but no fries, repeatedly. She never offered up the info that he could do that so I asked and she simply said, \"3 and a quarter.\" Not, \"sure, we can do that.\"  Not a nice thing about how she treated us. Not one.

But when I only had time for a fast lunch Windy City's #4 Best of Both Worlds 3 Inch Beef Sandwich and a classic Vienna Beef hotdog with no obnoxious ketchup fit the bill just fine. And unlike stopping at a cart along the street Windy City has tables to sit at so you can take your time and enjoy your food.   This is a nice little slice of Illinois right here in Vegas. Well worth your time to check out.   (Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #14)",

Pizza gives you endorphins, endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands. They just don't.  I couldn't agree with this sentiment more, except I would probably seriously maim anybody who tried to stand in the way of me and this pizza.   Deep dish is a while wait, but when you've got a place to sit outside, good company, and Nothing Bundt Cakes next door, what's the problem? Wait for the feast you're about to embark on.  A huge selection of toppings and of combos for Chicago dogs. The deep dish is crispy but then doughy towards the middle just the way it should be. I snarfed 3 pieces before I realized that I may go into cardiac arrest before the day was done. Then I ate the leftovers (heated up in the oven like bosses do) for dinner the next day and I was in heaven all over again.  The place is small but the owners are CRAZY nice and their service excellent. As Jaime mentioned, it's hard to cut with plasticware but next time I'll come prepared with a metal fork and knife. No really, I probably will.",

I used to put up with another pizza place in the area; that place had hung up on me and are impatient. None of that here.  Thin crust is cut into squares. The middle pieces are hard to eat. Maybe get cutlery. Make sure you have tons of napkins and cover your clothes. Loads of delicious oil drips off.   Meat special is loaded with pepperoni, sausage, bacon and ground meat. The pepperoni is so good. It actually tastes so good you try to find pieces with more of them. The ground meat contrasts with a barely seasoned taste, just meaty. I don't remember running into much bacon, but this pizza was good.   Chicago Style Italian Sausage comes in mild and hot. I opted for mild and got it wet. The bread is soggy but dense enough to hold up. It's loaded with sweet peppers. You can also get a side of marinara which I not only put in my sandwich, but dipped my fries in. Good stuff! Like the pizza eating this sandwich was a messy experience, but tasty.  Grab a calendar. They have random deals, things like if your name starts with the letter \"g\" you get a discount.

I'm a fan of the Chicago style thin crust pizza so i opted for a medium with sausage and pepperoni.  Also picked up a foot long chili dog ( includes a sack of fries )   The pizza  - nice crunchy crust with the graininess of the added cornmeal bottom ( which i like ) the sausage tasted great, probably a little more cheese than i prefer but not a bad thing.  The sauce - decent - strong oregano  taste.  And as usual, i dig the square cut as opposed to the standard slice cut.  The chili dog - a tasty mess !  Homemade chili ( no beans ) onions, cheese and mustard - ALL GOOD.  The sack of fries - nothing special.  Total cost - $26.50 ( not sure of breakdown cost between pizza and chili dog )   Price seems a little high so i've dinged them one star.  Overall, I like the place and may try again if in the area.",

Tucked away in a strip mall of off Eastern Ave (billed by me as the best road outside of the strip to find good eats), I feel Chicago authenticity when I walk in.  Just like the Vienna sausage company HQ in Chicago, IL, Windy City has yellow walls and plenty of Chicago maps and memorabilia.  The pizza comes in two Chicago styles, a thin crust or deep dish.  This time around I ordered the thin crust which had very melty cheese (not rubbery) and a good amount of sauce and well seasoned toppings.  As an app we had winds with a medium sauce, they didn't look good at first, but they were just the right amount of crisp and the sauce was a nice kick.   This isn't the normal sorta light and dry thin crust you come to expect at Sammie's or CPK and while I still enjoy those places, I must say that Windy City takes the crown.  Next-up: Deep Dish!",

When I got my Diet Coke refill I told her thank you and she was concerned he didn't like it and that is why she brought the plane dog. I explained to her he was upset about something else. I have not been anywhere else in Vegas where an employee had as much compassion and constant observation to make sure we enjoyed our meal. We will definitely be back and appreciate the kindness!!",

Being a chicago native, I had to check this place out. The deep dish is really good. They give you a lot of food for your money. They even sell oke doke popcorn and jays chip products.   This is definitely going to be my permanent place if I want some good italian beef. Overall, I give 5 stars because this place was really clean and the food was hot and fresh.",

I was trying to make a u-turn inside the target parking lot, when this place caught my eye. So I thought I'd give it a shot. As I walked in, the place was well lit, clean, spacious, and inviting atmosphere. They got extra points for having several flat screens with the game on.   I'll be back for sure",

But her Canadian Bacon & Extra Cheese Pizza was burnt, very thin, inexplicably cut into small squares, and fairly pedestrian.  Money for the pizza was refunded after Diane turned down an offer for a new pizza, but a Corn Dog replacement was accepted.  No problem here, except the cashier refused to take any additional money for the Corn Dog.    A #4 Windy City's Best of Both Worlds featuring a Vienna Beef Chicago Dog and a 3-inch Beef Sandwich yielded just the right amount of food to assuage my hunger.  The dog's relish was emerald green with zippy Sport Peppers, while the lean beef was tucked inside a soft bun with sweet Green Peppers and melting white cheese just dripping in juices.  Service, too, was excellent.",

    "text": "SO THIS IS WHAT YOU CHICAGOANS ARE USED TO!  I bookmarked this place because of all the check ins I see from my Yelp friends! If that many people just from my friends list go here, then it must be good! So the very first chance I got im all over it!  I asked the lady behind the counter what was good. She smiled and said everything. I asked what was good for a first timer. She said either the thin crust pizza or the Italian Beef or Sausage. So as my first ever order I went with the #13 Combo which was Italian Beef and Sausage on a roll which comes with fries and a drink. I also opted for the mozzarella cheese and sweet peppers. She asked if I wanted the sandwich dry, wet, or dipped. HUH? I guess I am a noob. Dry, the sandwich is just that. No sauce whatsover. Wet, they put a little bit of Au jus on the sandwich. Dipped, they literally dip the bottom half of the sandwich in Au jus. This sounded very intriguing so I picked that.   When I got my sandwich, the bottom half of the bread was literally falling apart from the sogginess of the Au Jus. Like the noob I was, I still picked it up and tried to eat it like a regular sandwich. That's when I noticed the plastic fork that came with it. FAIL. Needless to say, it was really good. The Beef and Sausage put together was like Batman and Robin, Shaq and Kobe, Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.......ok that last one was a bad example. Anyways, you know what I mean. The two meats mixed with melted mozzarella cheese and sweet peppers were fantasmic! (refer to my pic!) The fries were nothing to be excited about.  As I was scarfing down my meal, I noticed from the little cardboard cutout thingies that form a triangle (there were two of them) on the table. One had a picture of a Frozen Chocolate Dipped Cheesecake on a stick! The other said that tuesdays were 50 cent wing tuesdays. Just these two pieces of info alone should be more than enough to warrant another trip or three in the future!  I paid about around 10 bucks for my meal  which definitely filled me up. That was about the average price for any one of their combos.   Since the theme and ambiance was based out of Chicago, of course everything you saw on the walls were nothing but things about the windy city! The overall size of the place was very spacious and the location is sort of tucked away in a nice sized plaza.   I am definitely coming back to try the thin crust pizza and wings, especially on a tuesday! They have specials everyday. The day I went, the special was if your name was Dorothy or Ryan, you get a free hot dog! (with proof of your ID)  So in closing, this is another one of those places that you are glad you checked out for it will be on one of your good grub places to eat list! So yeah, I am definitely a fan!",

It took a bit to find this place as it is tucked in to a corner in the shopping center (next to Office Depot) look for the umbrella patio tables.  The people were very friendly and the place was clean and decorated with tons of Chicago stuff.  My husband had the Chicago dog and it was spot on and delicious.  He wanted to try the Maxwell polish too, but was full from the dog.  I tried the deep dish and it was wonderful.  They do a fantastic job on the crust and the cheese.  The tomato could have been a little more chunky (I am used to 6 in 1 course ground).  BUT - this place is great.  I wish them all the best because they have great food and great people serving it.",

What we ordered: 2 orders of Wings with Fries Meat specialty 14 inch Deep Dish  We killed the wings before even getting the Pizza. (Deep Dish takes half hour to bake) They were great and worth ordering again.   Finally the long anticipated Deep Dish came out and it was HUGE. Loads of meat and cheese, 3 grown males could barely finish two slices.   Was it worth the drive, price and wait? For me, Yes. A must try spot that I highly recommend to all.",

The sauce was chunky, with big pieces of tomato - loved it.  Threw a couple pieces in the oven day two and day three and it was perfect all over again!  Started with a salad, nothing exceptional except the freshness.  Every piece crisp and perfect.  Desert cannoli was big, sweet and really tasty.  Service was friendly and the shop was interesting and clean.  This was clearly a local favorite and if I were a local, it would clearly be my favorite, too!",

Get it while you still can! its a phenomenal deal! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.groupon.com%2Fdeals%2Fwindy-city-beefs-n-pizza&s=9ec6bb889fb411c67bb1e3e749ce76c4edda36be818bdbcfb772c86c0422c210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">groupon.com/deals/windy-...</a>   The pizza was absolutely delicious. Seriously The Best pizza I have ever had. It looked nothing like the deep dish pizza they had on their menu, but it tasted so good I could care less. The crust was perfection and that comes from someone who doesn't care for crust. The cheese was a wonderful melty, gooey yumminess. I chose mushroom, sausage, pepperoni and green peppers for my toppings. The sauce was perfectly seasoned. It was awesome!   The salad was mediocre. Nothing spectacular, but I didn't come for salad so I could care less what the salad was. And for the value I got in the pizza from the Groupon it made up for your basic shredded iceberg lettuce, a few tomatoes, and sliced carrot. I believe the pizza alone would have been $21.50  I was so full after gouging on that fabulous pizza I couldn't fit the cannoli, but I did take a bite of it to taste. The filling was good. Not too sweet. Creamy sweetened cream cheese with bits of chocolate chips. It tasted like cream cheese anyway. I don't think it was ricotta.   They have a 50 cent wing Tuesday with a minimum of 6 wings per order. Unfortunately I didn't order any because I knew we weren't going to be able to finish the pizza. The next time in Vegas we are definitely going to stop here for pizza again and hope to try some wings. I will come even if they don't have a Groupon because the pizza is awesome!!",

The walls are lined with Chicago memorabilia.  The hot dogs are yummy, the pizza is good, and the wings are decent. It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but it's solid and I like the deep dish. The wings are small, but a good quality that is cooked well. Skip the side salad - not even slightly worth the money. The cannoli is a good ending to your meal.  All in all, I'll be back a lot.",

My boyfriend hyped this place up so much saying there was nothing better than a hot dog from here.. but he hadn't been here in 10 years. Once I got the Windy City #1 hot dog I expected it to be the best thing on the menu because thats what the place is called, I was sorely mistaken. Everything was mushy and the hot dog tasted boiled, the only thing with a crunch was the pickle and that's all I could taste was pickle. Nothing looked fresh, the bun in fact looked like a corpse and fell apart like one too. In all honesty I could find a better hot dog at circle K. The best place to go is Steamie Weenie if you want a hot dog done right.",

    "text": "My introduction to Italian beef was through the new franchise of Al's Beef over on Sahara and Rainbow. I actually got a little bit of face time on the Yelp Las Vegas home page for that, so I felt the pressure to compare it to this place, which I hadn't tried until today. It helped that I found a Groupon for non-pizza items (so no, this is not at all a pizza review), and I decided to try a few different meats in buns.  First up, the Italian beef (#10). It's in a similar price range to Al's. It seems to be slightly better seasoned and herbed. Unfortunately, it didn't hit the palate quite as hard as Al's did. I think the beef may be a bit better, and the giardiniera looks more authentic and feels that way with the mix of veggies and peppers, but the au jus did not match up to Al's in terms of umami, and I'm thinking the bread may not be as durable. And yes, I got it dipped here as well. Small edge to Al's for just the overall impression.  Second, I had some of the Double Italian Sausage (#12). This is where Windy City Beefs fell flat for me. My comparison this time was to a well known purveyor of foods... which is a Costco food court in Virginia. Yes, they serve an Italian sausage sandwich at Costco on that coast. And yes, I actually would prefer to eat that one again. There was not enough sweetness in the onions and peppers or savoriness in the sausage here, and this one is significantly more pricey.  Finally, I tried a bit of the Polish sausage (#45) with fries. I actually was snacking on the shoestring fries with the other sandwiches, and keeping in mind that taking the fries to-go destroyed the texture (so it's not really the restaurant's fault), I thought the flavor was pretty good. That's all I can really say about that. As for the Polish sausage, it was really good and had so much more flavor than the Italian sausage. Sport peppers weren't actually all that bad for my palate, although they were unexpected. Anyway, this pretty much saved the average.  So, two good options out of three, and maybe future Groupons? I think I could see myself coming back. But I'm still kinda sad that I live way across town from Al's. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.",

Tonight's order they delivered diet soda instead of regular then we realize the THREE hotdogs ordered without buns etc for dogs wasn't included but paid for...so then they return with the correct soda and ONE hotdog cut up saying that there were three and we would NOT be charged when in fact we had already paid cash and did not receive a receipt which also is annoying. The delivery guy also said in future orders they wouldn't cut up the hotdogs nor would they be free!  I never asked for them to be cut up & never asked for them to be free although when we first started buying from here the owner GAVE us free cut up hotdogs for my sweet Labradoodle Sonny... We paid for three hotdogs as we now have three dogs and the deliver had one hotdog cut up and only two hotdog ends which was evidence it was only one! Nothing more I hate than a liar! We are done with Windy City!",

I don't remember the initials, but I do remember stuffing myself to the point of almost asking my man to carry me out!  I asked to come here for dinner because of Jamie W's review. We were so delightfully surprised at how much we loved the deep dish, we can't wait to come back and try the beef! We ordered the large pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions, black olives, green peppers and giardiniera . It was like a flavor explosion and a delight for all of my senses. The smell of the sauce, the crisp of the crust ( did I taste a hint of butter in that crust?) the crunch of the veggies, the heat of the giardiniera, the creamy meltiness of the cheese. Thank goodness there were leftovers. I just finished a leftover slice and it was as good as last night! The staff was nice, the place was clean. All that was missing was Coke Zero.  Enjoy, in moderation.",

She practically threw the food down when she brought it to the table.  In all fairness, we did walk in at 8:40 and they close at 9, but if she was in a hurry to close she could have told us that they were closing and we would have been fine eating at the sushi place next door that is open until 11.   The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the food was good.  We ended up finishing our meal at the tables outside where the atmosphere was more pleasant.",

I prefer some other \"deep dish\" pizzas to Windy City, but for dogs and beef and puffs, this place sates the Chicago longing cravings.   Pros: - Good food, good prices, good folk. - Chicago Style Hot Dogs. Done right.  - I like the fries. I seldom like fries. Crispy outside, fluffy within. - PIZZA PUFFS. - My husband can get his Lost Chicago Beef.  Cons: - When it gets busy, there can be a wait.

Compared to Las Vegas pizza it was better than most.  The cannolis were good.  I may have been over-charged a few bucks, but didn't quibble.  Service was excellent and folks very nice.  Plastic utensils are a big non-starter.  Atmosphere - basic deli.  Disclosure - I've lived in Chicago and worked at Giordano's so my review might be a bit critical.",

The service is great and everything tastes like it did back in Chicago.  Real Vienna beef and hot dogs, S. Rosen poppyseed buns, pizza puffs, Jay's potato chips, Old Style beer and Green River soda can all be found here!    I've had the pizza and the thin crust is crisp with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  The deep dish has a sweet tomato sauce on top and the pepperoni actually has a little bit of spice to it, which is way better than the bland stuff the chains use.  The crust is a butter crust similar to Lou Malnati's or Ricobene's deep dish.  The hot dogs are made authentic Chicago-style (no ketchup) and include the neon green relish, mustard, celery salt and sport peppers on a Vienna beef dog with a poppyseed bun.  Can't get any better than that.  The Italian beef is by far my favorite.  On an Italian roll, of course you have to get it dipped so the bread is falling apart and the au jus runs down your arm.  If you like spicy stuff, get their homemade hot giardinera made with habanero peppers.  No need to thank me.  I highly recommend this place, especially if you already \"know\" Chicago food.",

This place is legit coming from a guy who loves Portillos, Super Dawg, and Hot Dougs. Their Chicago dog tastes the same has Portillos. I used to do business in Chicago, so I went their a lot and had the usual Chicago staple. The irony is that my friends from Chicago don't eat Chicago dogs, Deepdish pizza, and Italian Beefs on a daily basis which I probably ate more Chicago food than them. I recommend this place for the Chicago dogs because I haven't tried the Italian beef like Al's in Chicago.",

I walked in and was greeted with a \"hello\" by the counter person.  I noticed one other customer I believe sitting at a table.  Looked clean and tidy nothing special, so I proceeded to order chicken wings mild which came with fries. My order was to go. The wings were soggy and flavorless and the mild sauce was given to me on the side in a little container.  The fries were in a bag and were greasy and soggy as well.  I really couldn't eat but two wings and I had to throw it away, it just was grossing me out.  I'm sorry but they need to step up to the plate literally and get their game on.  Your not the only wing, dog, pizza joint in town.",

I've had their beef sandwich wet with cheese and sweet peppers and it was superb.  I've had their Wednesday special:  beef and sausage combo and the flavor was just like home.  Had a slice of deep dish cheese pizza and it was great.  Tina is the hostess and order taker and is friendly.  Also recommend their cannoli's!  Fresh and crispy shell with delicious filling.  Did I say  I love this place??  Am just getting over my cancer battle and can't wait to get back there.",

There are other restaurants in the City that claim to serve Chicago style pizza, but the crust is not right nor is the sauce, etc.  Windy City does it RIGHT!  I just wish they had a location near Summerlin!!  VERY GOOD and I recommend them highly for pizza!",

    "text": "This was my first time trying out some Chicago eats, and let me tell you, it did not dissapoint. We decided to order the Chicago style deep dish pizza, I had never had deep dish pizza before, but I didn't see what the big deal was - it's a pizza with a but more dough. This was my pre- first bite opinion, and I was so very, very wrong. The pizza came, all hot and with the sauce on top- I was weirded out for sure, but then I took a bite and it changed my life forever. Not even kidding, I was still eating the thing even when I was full. Not only was this pizza the best deep dish Chicago style pizza I have ever had, but it is THE best pizza I have ever  had. It was a great foodie moment, but then the realization hit me - I live thousands and thousands of miles away from here and in a different county to boot! All I have to say is if you are in Vegas, try this pizza, it will forever change your life. If I am ever back in Vegas, this is the first and last place I want to stop in to grab me a slice of pizza pie heaven! The place sort of looks like your unsuspecting average pizza joint, but don't be fooled, amazing pizza lives here!",

We ordered and when I asked about how long the deep dish takes, they said 30 minutes. Luckily we had our salads to keep us occupied. Salad was good. The lettuce was fresh and green. It was topped with purple onion and two tomato slices. Could have used some shredded cheese just to make it look more appealing. Husband for the ranch and I got the creamy garlic dressing. They were both good. The garlic dressing was more of the consistency of mayo but it had a good taste. The pizza came out faster than 30 minutes. It was the perfect the perfect temp. Not so hot that we had to wait. It was huge! There was so much cheese! The cheese oozed off the peices. It was was delicious! The crust was crispy on the edges yet still soft under the cheese. It really was delicious! We didn't try the cannolis that were including in the deal because we were so full. We took them to go. We will for sure be back for the pizza. It was really good and would feed a lot of people since one piece is so big! The service was good. The lady was nice. It seemed they were having a problem in the kitchen and the guy in the back seemed irritated with the cashier but that had nothing to do with our transaction. One thing I did notice was there were several customers that came in and called (what I'm thinking is the owner) by name and he knew all their names and joked with them. He and the cashier really seemed to know their customers which I think is great. We had a nice experience and will be back to try more of their food!",

The sauce was great and the groupon was a plus we being from out of town would never had ventured of the strip if it wasn't for the groupons. One slice was enough to fill you up even with a salad prior. The cannoli's were great as well nice flavor to them. Not alot of places have cannoli's and if they do they are yuck. The only reason is wasn't 5 stars is the girl at the counter was rude and had the personality of a flea. Hope she has a great vacation since we had to hear about it. If we ever get back that way we will def stop again.",

    "text": "So disappointed in this 'taste of Chicago'!  Being from Chicago, whenever I see a restaurant that advertises its product as authentic Chicago food, I have to try it.  Tonight I stopped by to order the Italian beef/sausage combos for takeout from Windy City Beefs 'n Pizza.  The young lady behind the counter kept insisting how Chicago authentic the food was, but when asked if she was from Chicago, she stated no.  However, on with my order, the \"Chicago\" beef.  First of all, the sandwich didn't consist of \"thin slices\" of beef as described in their menu but instead the beef in the sandwich was in very small pieces.  And something that is repetitive all over the Valley when it comes to so-called \"Chicago\" beef sandwiches -- if you order a beef sandwich with sausage (called a combo), the amount of beef in the sandwich is minimal, nothing like Chicago!  In Chicago when you order a combo, besides the sausage, they smother the sandwich with beef piled high.  The bread had no consistency; it was soggy and falling apart.  And, it was shocking to see what Windy City calls giardiniera.  It's nowhere near authentic Chicago giardiniera.  Chicago giardiniera does not have jalapenos and the oregano in it was way too much.  It was spicy and tasteless.  Unbelievable!  As for their pizzas, looking at what the customers were eating reminded me of Tombstone pizzas.  Just saying.    There is nothing of Chicago here.  Too many disappointments!  Won't return, for sure!",

Yes I have the receipt which everyone can on Windy City's Facebook Page. My roommate then called back and asked to speak with the manager because her attitude was so bad and the fact she lied to him about the delivery, he wanted to let someone know. Well when he called back and asked for the manager she proceeds to say \"Oh Jeff, well the manager is cooking he will call you back\" He is from Chicago, He Loves the food here and even got me admit Chicago does better pizza and I'm from New York. but after this experience we both will NEVER go there again. We rather drive to the other side of town and go their location on Lake Mead. Also watch out for out for this locations apparent bad business practices because I just noticed on my bank statement they charged me $38.13. I did NOT give a $10 dollar tip!!!!!!   If you notice on the receipt I was already charged $3.00 for a tip!!!!",
