We were seated close to the kitchen and boy did I have a big reminder of what hard work restaurant work is!!!   I mostly wanted to comment on the service. It was exceptional. Bryan was our server and Mikey was his helper(?). They were so nice and friendly. Came around just enough.  We're local so don't know when we will return. There are so many more steak houses we need to try!! Thanks Bryan and Mikey for singing \"Happy Birthday\"",

Hubby got the porterhouse which was more tender than the rib eye so it was pretty yummy.  Portion was a good amount...we definitely could have shared one steak.  Service was great so overall a good experience.",

I told him I was going to order a filet and to bring me a glass of whatever wine he thought would pair best. He chose a Pinot Noir that was indeed a great pairing.   Onto the food... My filet was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. My dining partner went with the dry aged NY strip and it was gigantic. Two inches thick at least. He carved every shred of meat from the bone and when he was done, pointed to the bone and said \"I'm gonna miss you.\"  I've eaten a lot of steaks with this guy and that was definitely a first. I almost thought he would start tearing up over it.   We also got a Caesar salad, Brussels sprouts with bacon, and the side on special that night, mashed cheesy potatoes with bacon. I get Caesar salads everywhere because I love them, but this one will be skipped next time. It was just meh. For $9 I don't need a meh salad. The sprouts were excellent. And the potatoes. Oh, the potatoes. They are easily the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. I could've eaten the entire shareable portion myself.   It was a pricey place but that's what can be expected for a nice steakhouse on the Vegas strip. All in all, totally worth it.",

The food is of course so incredibly delicious too. My most recent visit was over labor day weekend last year. We ordered the filet minion, mashed potatoes, asparagus and a bottle of red wine. The filet was juicy and delicious, the mashed potatoes were warm and buttery, and the asparagus was juicy and crisp as well. I love taking a photo at the restaurant too - it's a nice romantic touch or a great way to capture a group memory. I'll continue dining at the restaurant - 15 years and counting...!",

So finally decided to give it a try, my wife and I went and I got the dry aged new York strip, loved the way they treat you there, the way they take care of you so once I order the steak I was excited, 5 years of want, 5 years of leaving and not getting a taste, this was finally the moment, D DAY ( HUGE steak lover as you can see ) and it arrives...i cut thru it like a old lady cutting traffic...lift off and straight to my mouth...5 years of excitement went down the drain pretty quick...streak didn't seem to be seasoned and it didn't seem to be worth the price I paid ( forgot ) wasn't a happy camper. I've had better steak from a mom and pops restaurant for way less. I still ate it and paid the bill but really killed my expectations. I still give it a 4 star as the rest of the food was great and drinks were on point.",

The food is good and the service was wonderful but I thought the tables were too close together and the price is way too high for what you get. The ambiance is nice and romantic but there are many places in Vegas where you can get upscale food and not break the bank. We ordered one steak (cheapest on the menu at $48), a market price fish at $45 and an order of asparagus (6 pieces for $10)...so our total came to $103 without tip! I'm not opposed to paying for good quality- I just didn't feel like this was anything special or that I need to come back for- I have plenty of that style of food right where I live. There are other places that are unique to Vegas and I'd go to those.",

Seconds before she walked up my husband and I were talking about how we never have good pictures of us together, and it took all of five minutes for her to capture us perfectly.

For years I've been stopping by this hotel (and I even stayed here once in college), but always completely missed this Manhattan-like strip.

We got to hang around and grab a beer here, but we had already eaten dinner. The staff was friendly (and funny) and they had an epic all glass meat refrigerator out front that made me wish I could have grabbed a steak here.

That being said, the Filet Mignon I experienced at this restaurant was in my top 3 steak experiences. Yum!!! Seriously, don't waste your time with Cut or the other over-hyped steakhouses in Vegas. True, old-world, New York City style dining in the glorious (and super sparkly) New York, New York Casino - this restaurant is a must. My steak was a perfectly cooked Medium accompanied by the macaroni & cheese (yes to the bacon flavor!) and mashed potatoes (low on over flavoring - which matches the steak perfectly). Pro-tip: don't get sauces for the steak. It's perfectly seasoned. We were obviously looking for a waist-line friendly meal. (Ha!)   We also enjoyed the Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara wine country (started with a B but can't remember the name). The entire table split a bottle and everyone was pleased by the smooth taste (with a $48 price tag - not too shabby). Calamari for the appetizer (standard) and a Cesar Salad (it was ok but nothing special). The waiter was incredibly accommodating (my gf spilled her full glass of wine all over the table and my newly placed plate of above mentioned meal and they re-plated and replaced the sides immediately) and the overall ambiance was nice.   Needless to say we walked into Zumanity in a food coma which was oh, so worth it!",

I promised myself that the next time I return, I'll throw a ridiculous bet on the hardway's with a couple of black chips in hopes the dice will hit the 10-1.  Haha, well don't get too excited cause it didn't happen, yet, that is...BUT instead I scored something just as good as I was kidnapped to celebrate a quick birthday overnighter in Sin City and to finally try one of Gallagher's steaks.   So why this place...? Dry-Aged beef is what we're talkin' bout peeps...that's right, not sticking a piece of meat in a vacuum-sealed bag that apparently also \"ages\" faster and in hopes to trim and reduce its water weight, hence the controversy of why very many steakhouses don't use the classical dry-aged process. As we all know time is money. Catch my drift...?   At Gallagher's, its old school \"aging'...We're talking countless hours and days of beef being stored in a special dry-aging cooler where a complex chemical reaction process that involves an intricate equilibrium of time, temperature, and the right humidity so that the beef's enzymes begins to break down and tenderize the meat. In return, Gallagher's delivers to you one of the utmost tender and most flavorful steak you'll ever eat. BOOM!   The Eats: Main Course: Dry-Aged New York Sirloin $43  Cowboy Rib-Eye Steak $45     slightly burnt edges (-.5) Sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Carmelized Onions $2 each Yukon Gold Potato Puree $8  meh. (-.5)  Ambiance: Dim lighting, tranquil noise level, semi-formal attire (Sported a Hawaiian shirt =P)  Customer Service: Product Knowledgeable, Friendly and Professional.  Tip: Make reservations. Its packed!  Peace!",

There is a sign next to it that explains all of the steaks served at Gallagher's is first wet aged for x amount of time and then dry aged for x amount of time.  I assume most passersby are doubly impressed by this.   My reaction however, was that - 1. The marbling on these steaks are not impressive   2.  They wet age first then dry age?  Why not just do dry aging for the entire process? Why even advertise this when it actually shows that you've gone the \"cheap\" route?  So, I order the Dry aged New York which came out overcooked.  I ordered medium rare and it came out medium.  Not only was the steak overcooked but it was DRY.  It was actually unbelievable as even when I half-heartedly cook sub-prime steak it doesn't come out dry     My friend's steak also came out overcooked.  I sent the steak back and got a new one....it was cooked correctly this time.   The actual flavor of the steak was not that great which i guess is ultimately the REAL problem.  It had an odd gamey flavor to it that is sometimes apparently in dry aged steak but never really in this unappetizing way.  The sides and appetizers were all unexciting and the service was sub par.  Our actual waitress was decent but the bus boys were pushy and seemed like they were in a hurry the whole time.    They just dropped the plates in front of us and constantly tried to take our plates away even though we weren't finished yet.   It's like they were in a hurry to get us the hell out of there.  Overall, I would say this place is below average in the world of \"Fine Steakhouses\"  I would recommend Mastro's Ocean Club if you wanted steak in Las Vegas",

Delicious. I love the warm mushrooms and the vinagrette they used. Absolutely wonderful.  Dry Aged New York Sirloin $40 (Our Signature House-Aged Bone-In Sirloin). Tender and tasty.  Porterhouse Steak $48. Surprisingly tender. I think this was even more tender than the sirloin. However, this piece was huge and had bone in middle.   I really enjoyed it and especially sharing one big meal is good enough deal. Makes it a better deal for the buck.",

    "text": "This place should really decide whether or not it wants to be an Outback Steakhouse or a premium steak house as advertised.  First things first, the service here was top notch from everyone from the hostess the busers, the waiter and the manager.  They were attentive without  being annoying, fast, and pleasant to deal with.  In regards to the food, the wife and I shared an appetizer of shrimp and cheesy grits which were both cooked and season perfectly.  For the main dish I had their signature dry aged steak and my wife had the fillet.  Both steaks were cooked to our request and tasted great.  The wife's fillet was so tender that it almost melted in your mouth.  Here is the con.  The resturant advertised itself as high end charging premium prices.  Their website stated that the dress was business casual.  When I pay 195 bucks for two people to eat I expect great food, great service, and great atmosphere.  And the last thing is the reason I can't give it five stars.  I have nothing against tee shirts and cargo shorts, in fact that's how I dress normally...just not when I go to a place with a dress code.  They allowed guest to come in wearing torn t-shirts and baseball caps and people that were so drunk they couldn't stand without assistance.  I'm all good with that...if I'm eating at an outback steak house.",

We ordered the cowboy ribeye medium rare and it must have been the toughest piece of meat I have ever eaten in a steakhouse. I was actually afraid of choking between the grizzle and the toughness that I cut the pieces much smaller than I ever would otherwise. I have eaten at steakhouses across the country and the meat quality here is shameful.   Service you ask? Wait, there is no server anywhere! We waited 20 minutes for bread after asking for some 4 times. Finally the bus boy was nice enough to get us some, not the waiter, not the manager... The service was just terrible. You don't expect to spend 70 bucks a person minimum and have to get up and find someone to refill your drink all night.    Clearly, I would not recommend this place, what a waste of money. I would rate the quality of food here way below that of Outback Steakhouse. To be peddling this in any hotel on the Las Vegas strip is shameful.",

I expect a good steak to need nothing additional, but my ribeye came with some type of sauce drizzled over it. I accidentally ordered mine medium well, when I meant medium/medium rare. They were more than willing to take mine back and re-make it, but I can't bear to waste a \"good\" steak.   Experience overall wasn't worth the pricey items, so I doubt ill visit again if I'm ever in the area.",

Service was fine.. nothing amazing... or over the top. The guy taking care of us did a nice job.   The food....  We had the shrimp and grits appetizer.  It was good.. not amazing... just good.   My wife, who isn't a steak fan, had the chicken.  Again... it was fine... but.. Nothing amazing.   I had the cowboy rib eye.  It was slightly over cooked.. not tough, but not melt-in-your mouth.....amazing.  Lacked seasoning...  and if I'm 100% honest... I've made rib eyes at home that were as good or better...   the Bearnaise helped along with the onion strips.   All in all...  the bill was $165 .. not a huge amount but the meal and experience didn't live up to the bill. Not even close... it was a mediocre experience at best.   My advice... either cook a great cut of steak at home the way you love it... or make reservations at other steak houses in Las Vegas.  This place just didn't do it for us... it didn't live up to the hype IMO.  FYI  *** the only steak they dry age.... is the Dry-Aged New York Sirloin***   the other steaks are not dry aged per the guy serving us.   Frank",

I wasn't in the mood for steak, so I ordered the lamb and so did one of my friends. The lamb was the only thing that salvaged this review from being 1-star. The lamb was cooked exactly as we requested. The steaks on the other hand were ALL totally off the mark. Two of my friends ordered their filets medium. One came out totally overcooked, like a hockey puck, the other \"medium\" steak was practically raw. I'm a fan of the medium-rare preparation, but this was extreme. When my friend asked for it to be cooked a little more, they sent it in and it still came back undercooked. He again had to request they cook it a little longer. The third time it came out overcooked, shocker.  This whole debacle was really disappointing. The birthday boy said he wishes he had just gone to Outback Steakhouse.",

I ordered the roasted chicken cooked with a butter sauce, but it was so plain and unflavored. We also ordered the creamed spinach side dish, which we found to be too sweet. The mac and cheese side was to die for, and the dessert was lovely. Next time I think we'll order the prime rib. Hopefully we have a better experience next time!",

It started with a distracted waiter who took forever to take our drinks and meal order.  A table that arrive after us actually had their order taken before ours. It was kind of surreal but with all the great reviews we thought it would be worth the wait. Well, it wasn't! Our sirloin steak was bland and rather fatty. The spinach was way too salty and disgusting. Highlights of the evening was the mashed potatoes but this does not save their rating. This was a pricey adventure and one that won't be repeated. I don't have a steakhouse recommendation for Las Vegas visitors but if you are ever in Chicago and want to taste an excellent aged steak, check out Joes Seafood, Prime Steak &Stone Crab...mmmmmmm!",

Service was beyond impeccable, and the house wines were both good.  We shared a Caesar salad with large strips of Spanish Anchovies (not as salty as others), and that plus our two entrees and a baked potato that we also shared, plus 2 wines and 1 iced tea came to $130.00. Add tip to that.  If we were big eaters and had an appetizer, another salad or soup, another of their yummy sounding sides, and maybe a drink or two, plus dessert and coffee, we could easily have spent over $200 per person.

Both husband and I ordered rib-eye and shared jalapeno mashed potatoes (special), mushrooms, and creamed spinach. DELICIOUS! The choices of bottles of wine are very reasonable. Prices range anywhere from $50 to $600. Overall, a wonderful experience. We will definitely return.",

    "text": "This is really about a New Years Eve experience, and lack of organization. There are dozens of high end Steakhouses to choose from in Las Vegas, but most serve a set menu on NYE. I had called ahead to see if the entire menu was available at Gallagers I was assured it was, so that's were I chose to eat. have often eaten at the one in NYC on NYE and it was great.  I made a reservation for 7:15. We weren't seated until 7:45. Then were told we had to choose from a limited menu- and no substitutions on sides. And each steak came with something different. I was told by the manager that we had been given wrong information. We should have left then, but it was getting late and we had tickets to a show.. Then the food took 50 minutes to arrive!! We had to rush through a very expensive meal, and asked for the check before we were even done. Everyone in the restaurant was very upset as they were dealing with the same issues. The food finally arrived, and it was very good, but overall such a bad experience I don't think I will come back. We have often eaten at the restaurant in NYC on NYE, and it was very organized and delicious. This place was chaos. It's probably fine on regular evenings, but this was a very disappointing dining experience.",

Our server Bobby and busser Juan were excellent as were the oysters Rockefeller, tomato soup and baby beet salad we began with. The house chardonnay was wonderful.  Then the meal went downhill. The broccoli side was ok, the four cheese macaroni was not awful, but not worth more than two bites.  My husband's age-dried steak had one tough string (sorry I don't know the name of the wide white ribbon of fiber) but mine had two. The steak knifes looked wonderful but both mine and my husband's were very dull, making it difficult to cut through the fiber.  The six or seven bites of meat I had without the fiber were very tender and well seasoned.  We shared an excellent key lime pie for dessert, but the coffee my husband ordered was really weak-he ordered an espresso and poured it into his coffee to make it drinkable.  To top it all off, the place was very noisy.  We both began to loose our voices by the end of the meal from having to almost yell and repeat things. A few highs points balanced out by low..",

The customer service was phenomal, our waiter was so attentive and checked on us frequently (but not stalker frequently).  He was really knowledable about the steaks (I wanted to know which was the softest.)  I ordered a lemond drop which was the most fabulous lemon drop I've ever had.  I ordred a New York steak, my husband ordered the Cowboy Sirloin or something like that.  I should technically have given them 4 starts since they mixed my medium with his medium rare, but that being said within minutes of us letting them know, the manager was at our table apologizing for the mistake (they took my m.rare and cooked it to med) and he offered us each a dessert on the house!! Like I said, phenominal customer service.  I would definitely go back to this place.  Great drink, great food, great people!  One recommendation to those who havent been there: The steaks are enormous!  I would recommend sharing the steak with someone, unless you want to carry around the take-out box as you walk the strip.",

The steak was certainly not dry aged it tasted like the steak from smiths, and it was marinated, can you believe that. Seriously , this restaurant marinates their steak to make it tasteful.I thought it was dry aged??how can they get away with this travesty. Do the majority of the public fall for this False dry age mumbo jumbo. Ppl save ur money and just go buy some steak at smiths., if you don't believe me then go throw away your money on this pretentious dry age B.S.",

My only complaint: Does everything need to be \"super sized?\" Most of us were unable to finish even half of our steaks, they were so large, and it just felt plain wasteful - especially since our puppy couldn't make the trip to Vegas with us. :) It would have been nice to see some \"petit cuts,\" for those who have a more reasonable appetite. In any event, highly recommended for a fun evening and a good steak.",

I ordered a medium filet mignon. After I cut open the steak I found that it was served substantially raw. Despite my asking the bus boy 2 times to find our waiter, I waited for 6-7 min for him to appear (big, bald german). They recooked the steak and forced all of the juices out through the incision I created. My guest's ribeye was also undercooked; but he declined to send it back. After my second bite of steak I noticed that the restaurant was filling up with smoke. This continued  until the smoke became so thick that it was difficult to see across the restaurant. The line cooks were all cracking up over their broken ventilators. The restaurant cooks over coal or wood, so the smoke was noxious. Management did nothing proactively. They were content to watch all of their guests sit in a toxic cloud. Not being one to sit back and be taken advantage of, I told our waiter that we wished to leave immediately. He soon returned with a $0 check. 95% of my dried out steak was left uneaten.",

The crab cake (3) appetizer was fantastic, fresh and almost completely crab. The bread was fresh and complimentary, would've liked it better served warm.  We had the wedge salad  presented nicely with heart of palm and baby tomatoes, blue cheese dressing was good. I had the dry-aged, bone-in New York sirloin.  It was perfectly cooked medium rare, averagely tender.  It is served with a sauce on it, which I could've done with out.  I feel a steak should speak for itself, and if it needs a sauce then it's not a great steak. My wife had the pork chops, and we didn't eat them.  They were very tough with almost no flavor, very disappointing! The mushroom medley was terrific, and the colossal baked potato was definitely that!   The best part of the dinner was the staff.  Very professional, attentive and friendly.  We were given the opportunity to replace the pork chops, but we were so full we declined.  So thanks to Roberto and Mike! Great job guys!",

So we were really disappointed when our dinner was not real good and took nearly 3 hours. We had wine and appetizers to start, a \"seafood celebration\" that everyone loved ( $38.00 per person but worth it) and then we ordered our main courses. We all had steaks and it took nearly 45 minutes from when we ordered them to when they showed up.. The restaurant had cleared out so it wasn't an issue of being overly busy, when the steaks arrived they were all barely lukewarm and the sides were basically cold. It was pretty obvious that they had somehow sat for a period of time before being brought to our table. I mentioned to the manager on duty and his solution after having to \"think it over \" was to first offer us new meals ( it was past midnight by then so no one was much interested in waiting around for another round) and then offered to bring us some desserts and after dinner drinks ( more food and drink but not offering to do anything about getting a lousy meal) .. Our bill for 4 people was $620.00 and , although we are completely ok paying that for a special night, what we got was such a downer it would be hard to not remember this the next time we visit Las Vegas ..",

I tried the Cowboy Ribeye, with the waiters recommendation, and it really was the best steak I have ever had, bar none. Don't let the prices fool you, and though the cost is a bit eye opening, it is well worth the price due to the quality and the flavor of the steak. I recommend any steak due to the fact that it is both wet and dry aged, and then it is cooked with an unmistakable mesquite flavor. My mouth is watering just writing this review.  The service and ambience were a close second to the food, and how much I raved about the steak, both the service and the ambience are no slouches. Service was very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. The ambience was great, clatter and chatter of restaurant patrons coupled with the charm of the restaurant makes this a different and upscale experience, than I can definitely say I haven't had the pleasure of enjoying of this level until now.

It was a special night in April 2017 and we made sure we were going to make it in by reserving a spot for 5pm. The hostess for that Saturday needed an attitude adjustment and did not set the tone very well for the evening but the rest of the night made up for her. Never forget her though and her welcoming snarkiness! Maybe she was just having a bad day. Our waiter was professional and our busser was hilarious. \"BADABOOMBADABING!\"! Will never forget him either! The filet special steak was melt in your mouth good. Thick, juicy, perfectly rare and expensive. This is Vegas, ya gotta open your wallet at a steak house. Worth every penny as were the sides. Who knew, I grew up to like brussel sprouts! I am a sucker for potatoes (loaded mashed). Delicious. I loved the clam chowder. I wanted to bathe in it - then I wanted to swim in my potatoes! The calamari was pretty good, standard. He loved his porterhouse steak too. The kind of thankful bites where you close your eyes and chew. Because you cannot get up and do the happy dance. Maybe next time! The place was jumping/getting loud as the evening wore on at NY NY but we were luckily seated in a pretty decent spot. Romantic lighting. Kitchen action. The restrooms were way across the space and out into a gloomy hallway - not unusual for this town but, meh. Not ideal. There are so many steakhouses in Vegas but I cannot stop thinking about this place and will be heading back there as soon as our wheels hit the strip. It was that good.",

The sides were good but the Cheesy mashed potatoes was a disaster they said it was Asiago Cheese except that asiago cheese tasted like cheap Parmesan overpowering the entire dish and we had two orders. Overall would of still been ok but most got sick that night or feeling the effects now. I just wanted our bill was approx 294.00 and 201.00 why split that way I haven't a clue. We paid 600.00 not bad but you really are killing my night and my time in Vegas the next day. I love the old Gallagher's from Atlantic City inside Resorts casino White it's nostalgia and history it was one of my favorite steak places to take my mother and we went to AC for a trip, She's gone now and I guess so our you.",

I'm a huge fan of dry aged steak. Saw the aging steak in the window at the front of the restaurant and made some assumptions I shouldn't have. Misleading and tantalizing as the image of dry aging steak was, I admit that the sign on the wall clearly says that the bone in NY strip is only dry aged 15 days and then wet aged. Which, of course, means the steak isn't at all dry aged in the sense that those of us who are fans of dry aged steaks understand it: 4-6 weeks for dry aged taste and 6- 8+ weeks for the next level in flavor and aroma. Shame on me for not reading the sign.  Ordered the \"dry aged\" bone in NY strip. Took that first bite expecting the flavor of a dry aged steak that I love so much. And then despair and disappointment...a steak I could have gotten just about anywhere. Suggestion to restaurant: either really serve a dry aged steak or don't create the illusion.",

Aside from our busser/ assistant our experience was less than stellar. When you are paying 250 plus dollars for dinner. It should be a great experience. The lack of training in simple etiquette of the service staff shows the level of detail forgotten here.   Treat every table with the same respect. Don't assume because we have a teenage daughter with us that we aren't good tippers. We were neglected from the moment we got there. The food was subpar for what we paid.  We ordered 3 filets mid rare. All came out different temps and varying quality. Our sides were the same. The creamed spinach was a milky texture. The garlic mash potatoes were thin and looked like they were out of a bag.   I do not recommend eating here anymore. I have eaten at Gallagher's for the last 12 years. From celebrating birthdays etc. Disappointing visit all the way around.",

But nonetheless the steaks are excellently prepared.  We were served all of the preliminaries (ex water, bread) promptly. To start out the hubby orders clam chowder, which he says was very good but, not as good as Chart House's. I order the spinach salad which contained sliced strawberries, watermelon, nuts, bleu cheese, and a very light dressing--too light, almost non-existent. I do not recommend this salad.   With our entrees we ordered a very nice Pinot Noir by Macmurry Ranch. Our entrees were a filet mignon and a surf and turf (6oz filet and 1lb. of split king crab legs). Our sides included a sauce of shallots and Beaujolais and asparagus. Everything was amazing. Unfortunately we were so full we didn't have any room for dessert. We really wanted to try the bread pudding too! Next time!  I highly recommend this restaurant but I do wish they served USDA prime. IMO they're just that much better.",

The waitstaff is professional, attentive and formal, which helped to raise the the classy vibe of the place.   Don't fill up on the bread (delicious as it was)-- you're going to need to save all the stomach space you can for the fantastic cut of meat that will soon be coming your way. It's been about a week and I think I'm still full from this dinner.  The Prime Rib of Beef was fabulous. Our server told me it was a \"Queen Cut\", which is about an inch thick. This is the thickest prime rib I've ever seen! It could have easily been split between 2 people. Toward the end of dinner, I was completely full and just had to sit there and stare at it for a good 10 minutes to convince myself I had enough room for another few bites.  The texture was great. At first bite, I thought the flavor was good. After pouring the au jus all over it, I was in love. The au jus had a beef or vegetable broth flavor to it. It was very unique in comparison to other au jus I've had in the past. I'm not a huge fan of fat on my meat/steak, but the fat was very tender and melt-in-your-mouth good.   The mac n cheese was good from the few bites I had of it. I was more focused on trying to take down my giant cut of Prime Rib.    Added bonus: $10 cocktails! Score! Good price for Vegas hotel restaurant/bar. Another bonus-- This restaurant is right by the Zumanity theatre-- very convenient if you're trying to catch a nice dinner before the show. Reservations definitely recommended.",

The service is spot on, the busboy was on top of everything.   The food is good, no complaints. This is a True steakhouse, how you order your steak is exactly how it comes. Some chain restaurants tend to overcook the meat slightly, so be aware, medium rare here is medium rare.   We started with a stuffed portobello mushroom. It was tasty, to be honest it tasted like the ones I cook at home. Perhaps they were peeking in my kitchen.   We each ordered a filet mignon and shared a side of asparagus between the two of us. I believe this is the way to go at this restaurant. It was plenty of food. Everything is a la carte. Both of our steaks were cooked exactly to order as mentioned above. They were good steaks, but not wow I've never had a steak this good.. good.   We finished with a creme brulee. My favorite. It was creamy in the middle with a perfect crust on top, just as it should be.   We went with two other couples. With gratuity included (party of 6 or more), our bill per couple was slightly over 200. Not bad. Of course we had a beer each and an after dinner drink. I think the food served was worth the price, based on quality cuts of meat and the skill at which it was cooked. However, I think for the price I may be able to find something with more of a wow factor for me.",

Whether it be the amount of mesquite wood they are using to cook their steaks on the open flame or their drying process but I'll tell you what this was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten at any restaurant in any part of the world hands down!It is a bit of a maze to find going through the New York New York hotel but it is absolutely worth it!",

    "text": "The hubby and I spent our Valentine's Day in the sin city Las Vegas. We made dinner reservations at NY-NY Gallagher's Steakhouse. From the beginning we were greeted by a friendly hostess and did not have to wait due to our reservation. Once seated, we were welcomed by a courteous, friendly and informative waiter. We asked for recommendations on the drinks, appetizers, and the steaks. Some were taken and others were not. I ordered the raspberry lemon drop martini, rimmed with sugar, the drink was delightful and hubby ordered his normal drink of an old-fashion with Jim Beam. Our appetizer, a waiter recommendation, was the oyster rockefeller, this appetizer was so good, it came with six sweet oysters topped with a spinach bread crumple and delicious cheese. We squeezed some lemon on top and they were gone before we blinked, great recommendation.   Our second round of drinks, I ordered the Moscow mule, I'm a big fan of the floral notes and ginger beer in mules and the hubby ordered a blue moon. I ordered the pear& walnut salad, this was good but not great, plating and presentation could be better. My other half had the Caesar salad, same thoughts. Our main meals included petite filets and Australian lobster topped with crab. Our streaks were cook to our specifications, flavorful and tender but the star of the night was the lobster, so fluffy white and buttery...melt in ur mouth good! For the dessert we ordered the dessert of the evening, chocolate and red velvet heart pastries, a sweet finish to a great intimate dinner with my loved one.",

    "text": "A five, a five, and another five. So many fives. Gallagher's is so good. Simply put, probably the best steak I've ever eaten.  The menu claimed that the aged Strip was their trademark, but I went ahead and ordered a filet mignon. A few moments after I regretted my decision, but after taking a bite, I was really glad that I ordered what I did. The filet mignon has an incredible crust on the outside, and my steak was cooked just about as I ordered it (medium rare) on the inside. I say \"just about\" because parts of mine were a bit rare, but not raw, so I wasn't at all picky about it. I also opted to get their chowder as an appetizer, had a side of green beans with my steak, and tried the calamari -- which was my first time ever having it. Oh yeah, I also had some mac and cheese.  All really excellent. If you haven't eaten calamari, I'll just tell you that (at least in this case) it's a very mild almost nonexistent flavored flavor with a slightly chewy but tender texture to it. The appearance of tentacles may gross you out if you order it, but trust me, it's good eats. The mac and cheese was also great and had a nice little bitterness to it to keep the already rich cheese from being over the top. I often tend to much prefer baked mac and cheese, but Gallagher's is some of the best non-baked mac and cheese I've had. The chowder was delicious as well, and was probably my favorite I've ever had until I wound up having some in Seattle, but that's for another review. I really liked the fact that it was a bit on the thinner side, because super thick chowders just aren't my thing. I didn't get much of a bacon flavor, but I did get a bacon smokiness which was fantastic.  Gallagher's is expensive. If you couldn't guess that by it being a steakhouse in Vegas, you'd hopefully guess it based on the look of the place. I will tell you that everything about Gallagher's is phenomenal. It was a bit too warm for comfort sitting next to the kitchen, but everything about it was awesome. I'd like to try another \"fancy\" restaurant the next time in Vegas, but it'd be hard for me to go somewhere other than Gallagher's when I know it's so damn delicious.",

Ended up waiting an hour for food to arrive so if you have a show or anything on your schedule I would recommend at least two hours ahead for this place. I'm from Texas and I will say I had much better marbled steaks for much cheaper. I tried this place specifically for the \"dry\" aged steak which is supposed to bring out the steak flavor or enhance it in its own way, but it did not. On top of that they do not put any spices on their steaks. Not even salt or pepper. For the price I wouldn't suggest it. If your looking to spend cash on sub-par food then go here",

It was juicy and just cooked well. For our sides: mac&cheese which was gone within 5 minutes compliments to my boyfriend. Also we got a baked potatoe which was dry and bland. Nothing too special.  I would have given 5 stars, but one reason I didnt is because our waiter was probably never seen. He took our order and that was the last of him. We reached out to him for our check and after we paid we left. He never came to check on us. It was actually another gentleman, not sure if he was a busboy or cook but he was wearing all white, whom was helping us make sauces for our steaks and actually came to pack up my boyfriend's leftovers.  Another reason for not giving 5 stars, they don't have any bathrooms inside the restaurant. You actually have to go outside of restaurant and share a bathroom with the rest of NewYork NewYork. Mind you there was a huuuge line and super inconvenient.",

We booked in advance using <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> (which was super easy) and were seated as quick as they could set up the table. We ordered the mac and cheese, asparagus, avocado microgreens salad, and split the Dry Aged New York steak. The microgreens salad came out first and to say this thing was delicious would be an understatement. It was bursting with flavor. Then, when I thought it couldn't get much better, the steak came out. Wow! Dry aged is 100% the way to go and I am definitely a changed man after consuming that steak. It was cooked to perfection, tender, and absolutely delicious. Oh and if your wife isn't a big meat eater like mine, this steak was perfect for the both of us. I cut off probably a 4-6oz edge for her and we both left VERY full. Service was great and it was a perfect start to the night.",

There was no room at the bar so we just had to wait around. The place was packed on a Friday night so I'm sure a reservation is necessary.  My wife's heirloom tomato salad really wasn't as the menu described it. My caesar was good. Both of our entrees were wonderful. My prime rib was bigger than advertised and full of flavor. Her filet and lobster were both to her liking. The lobster was especially good.  The reason for taking a star away was the overall service. My wife's water glass was frequently empty and we rarely saw our server. Our bread basket was empty and just left on the small 2 top table after the salads were delivered and then taken away.  Either take it away or ask us if we want more. I was never asked if I wanted another drink either, and by the end we figured we'd just head out to the casino to get another one.  The food was great but even on a busy night neither of us felt like we had a great overall experience, and when we're paying these prices, we simply expect better service, and they fell short.",

Lobster was tasty but not near as soft as it should be couldnt chew parts. As for the aged-steak, tasted heavenly, but again, so many  unchewable areas left me looking for room to put chewed unswallowable chunks of meat. Too much fat was left on and it was blended all over the meat you cant just cut a part and the fat is out. Best part of meal, an incredible, best of the best warm spinach salad, hands down the most memorable and best salad ive had in 34 years. Definately not worth returning for the price, but they comped my ass since I'm a table freak, so a $20 tip didnt seem that bad. Good service, mixed food, 100% not worth the price except that darn salad still salivating over it---ORDER IT",

The waiter fails to mention that the salad he would be bringing, was a hunk of a slice of lettuce with miscellaneous items thrown over it, thus making it a salad! On top of that my lobster tail was twice the price of my steak. Last but not least, me and the boyfriend became severely sick.  The worst stomach ache and diarrhea known to man.  This was the last thing we needed to end our Vegas trip! We spent our last night taking turns on the ivory throne, pooping our lives away. We couldn't point out if it was the lobster or the steak.  The next day after having peptol bismol our stomachs settled and i had leftovers,  my boyfriend decided to take a chance with the steak again,  whaddaya know,  he's pooping his brains out once again.  Very bad experience and i don't think we will ever visit again.  Thanks for the overly priced laxative though.",

The first time my man and I dined here we ordered a dry aged filet for him and the steak and lobster special for me...long story short, my plate was $200 of pure, unadulterated goodness (In related news, you should probably ask how much Market Price is...now we know) containing a 20-ounce sirloin AND a WHOLE LOBSTER (Seriously.  Not the tail.  THE WHOLE THING.) that was cracked at the table for me.  It was amazing and continues to reign supreme as the most expensive thing I have ever eaten.  The second time we came, I was still in awe of my last trip and expected the same glorious experience to happen again (this time with less steak and lobster).  The second time around, however, I spent a ton of money on an overcooked, dry, and tasteless steak.  How a restaurant can deliver such opposing meals makes it hard to want to come here for a third try.  I want to go again, especially when staying at NYNY, but I'm afraid the consistency just isn't there...OR I can go with the knowledge that I will have to be that guy and send my steak back (which I NEVER do) because for the money I am paying, the steak should blow my mind.",

    "text": "Man.. we went to Gallaghers with a very high expectation.  That was mistake #1.  We went there without reservations (mistake #2), but happily waited 1.5hrs.  Then we ordered our steaks (Filet Mignon and the their signature, aged sirloin) cooked medium... big mistake.. huge (mistake #3).  I asked the server how they cook their meat.. medium = pink all the way through?  The server said confidently yes.  We trusted him.  I had wrongly assumed that steakhouses tend to undercook their meat (order medium = get medium rare..).  Our steak was dry.  Both of ours.  The filet was medium well.  Some parts were cooked all the way through.  We should've complained.  But we didn't.  I almost choked on some parts of the meat.  My wife kept telling me that I cook a better steak at home.  The appetizer (oysters) were ok, but they were nothing special at $3 per piece.  The soup (chowder) and the caesar salad was pretty good.  Up until the steaks came out we were very happy.  Then the steaks just disappointed us.  Man.. I really really love steaks and I had high hopes.    We were there with 2 little kids.  They gave us a booth and we did ok.  I always feel bad about taking little kids to nice restaurants.  It could be annoying to others there.  It would've been worth all the trouble taking little ones to a good restaurant if the meat was good.    Now, forever I'll wonder what if I ordered the steaks medium rare.. or even rare... forever.  Service was good, but not excellent.  Atmosphere was ok.  it's an upscale, busy restaurant.  If you're gonna go here, make sure to get a reservation and order steaks rare.  I would've given them 2 stars but because it was us who ordered medium.. 3 stars for what it could've been.",

We were seated fairly quickly. Three menus for four of us. Wrong apps the first time, waiter argued and told us what he brought was correct. FAIL! Bread finally came, not fresh. FAIL! Yeah, I know it's not a bakery. First bottle finished. No entrees. Second bottle ordered. 3/4 bottle completed. Entrees arrive. I appreciate dry-aged beef flavor and texture, ordered rare and medium rare. Their meat quality leaves much to be desired. Argumentative service doesn't garner any points. Room acoustics are abysmal. Large parties should now share the same small dining area with quiet intimate tables.",

None of the personnel, with exception of the water waiter, was carrying a smile on their faces. We placed our orders and realized that our waiter named Aris never asked my husband how he wanted his $63 file minion done, not to mention that it arrived in a very pathetic looking form... it was dry and tasteless and we almost thought we are the wrong place.  He also very arrogantly replied to our question when we asked to share an entry - saying that it is the busiest night of the year and guests must order full entries.  When he brought our wine and mineral water for spritzers, he literally said: \"here you go, please mix it yourself, because I don't know how you want it\".  Not to mention that we felt very rushed as they were taking our plates away.  And then, we did something we have never done before:  we tipped the water waiter and told him that he was the only nice person in the restaurant and we left zero tip on a $207 bill for Aris.  I hope the Gallagher's management reads this review and does something to improve...in the meantime, we will continue going back to the CircusCircus Steakhouse that never failed us.",

    "text": "It's Vegas. I'm a SoCal native and Vegas is ALWAYS a weekend option especially since it's only a few hour drive away. Minus all the obvious reasons one of the big attractions for me has always been food. Whether it's finding the next best buffet, a unique cuisine or just some top notch high end restaurants all concentrated into a small area. One thing I try to always do when getting into Vegas is to find a new steakhouse. Well this time around I was recommended to Gallagher's.   First off it's a welcome change to enter a steakhouse not feeling out of place with everyone dressed up as if they were going ballroom dancing. We were seated for a table of eight. It was quite early and we had a 8PM dinner reservation. We are all meat eaters so our table had center cut filets, new york sirloin, queen cut prime rib and for myself the cowboy ribeye steak. Minutes later they came back to tell us they ran out of prime rib. I mean it's barely a quarter past 8pm. Whatever they proceeded to change their order to a steak instead.   But back to my steak. I like it \"Black and Blue.\" Now there are some places that I will make sure they know what I'm talking about but these type of high end restaurants with this high of a rating I would imagine they would know. Also my server took my preference without skipping a beat. Normally if the case I will be asked for an explanation if they don't know. When brought out of course it was clearly not black and blue but it was rare. I told the server that this was not \"Black and Blue\" and that it was rare. She proceeded to tell me \"That is how OUR black and blue is.\" What the hell does that mean? Now I can eat my steak medium rare (normally cheaper or skinnier steaks) and I can eat it rare also but it's my least choice. The funny thing was that she didn't even offer to send it back to have it redone, she instead stared at me with a long pause as though to say, just eat the damn thing. I hate sending food back, possibly fear from the movie \"Waiting\" and stories from friends. So I just kept it. It tasted like wet beef. It's almost as if they kept it in a bucket of water overnight threw on the grill and slapped it on my plate. For my side I had creamed spinach which was more cream then there was spinach. This is a first also, I did not finish my steak. Blasphemy!!! It was simply that bad. You might be thinking hey you got it rare, well shoot I've had it rare many places and have loved it.   The highlight of the night was simply the spirits menu which was a lit up menu that at first I thought it was a touch screen but it wasn't. The wine was excellent that was chosen by the server but do not remember the name, simply because I was so upset about my meal. Everyone else had similar opinions being average but nothing spectacular.   When it comes down to it the food was not even ok. I'm surprised this place is still here with so many steakhouses popping up in Vegas now you can easily walk down the street and find another prime steakhouse. The two stars is almost out of sympathy since the only reason the second star is there is my wine and scotch. Either way it's hard to want to give this place a second chance again since there are so many other options available. Maybe once I've exhausted all other places and I make my rounds again I might give this place a try if I'm stuck at NYNY or have won a few black chips while at the table.",

If I had to choose one favorite restaurant in Vegas, this might be it. I've been to many steakhouses in other locations as well like Mastro's Steakhouse, Lawry's. But I have to say this is my favorite out of all. The price is definitely affordable and the food is just AMAZING.   My favorite on the menu is definitely shrimp scampi for appetizer and colossal baked potato for the side. I only tried their dry aged new york steak, and I love it. Even the bread they give you on the side was really good, One minor miss for me was the desert section. I wish they had more to choose from, since there were only a few to choose from.   One thing on the menu that I would definitely NOT recommend however, is their caesar salad. It was really not that great. I would defiantly order something else on the menu.   Give this place a shot if you are at Vegas and want to have good steak.",

On all occasions service & food were great!!! No problem even without reservations. And there were one time even though we have reservation we had to wait for 15 mins. Still we were ok with it. Dec 30, my BF ordered Prime Rib, medium rare. Everyone thinks its more rare than usual, but it is still ok. Split a Ribeye with sis, and they split it for us. Correctly seasoned and service were attentive. We thought ok, we know this is a good steak resto, reasonably priced and good customer service. We can come back again and again.  Now, the updated version:   We tried coming in again on Dec 31, the next day. We were staying at the hotel. So we just came down from our room and tried getting in.   1st Receptionist: How many on your party? Me: 2 2nd Receptionist (one next to 1st receptionist): Sorry, but we are fully over booked tonight if you dont have a reservation.  My issue with that conversation was that why ask how many in the party when you are going to say that they have to turn us away. They could've said right then and there do you have a reservation? And not ask how many on your party and then turn us away with a flimsy excuse of saying they are FULLY OVER BOOKED. Like in NO CHANCE IN HELL will we let you in.",

I got the meat sweats just watching an insane amount of meat being consumed.  One King Cut Prime Rib, about the size of a small dinosaur, landed with a thud on our table.  It was then I understood why my friend didn't order any sides.  This steak was  going to be a challenge.    Another challenge unfortunately, was understanding the price tag.  I get it.  Fine dining atmosphere, dry aged beef and fresh seafood.  To me it was a fluffed up steakhouse.  Not bad, but not outstanding enough to shell out that kind of dough again.    Located inside the New York New York Hotel and Casino right near the main entrance.  The restaurant is completely open facing the commotion of the casino passers by.  The bar wraps around so you can have a drink while waiting for a table.  It's decorated with photos of famous New York alumni covering the walls.  You can take a look at the steak they use in a window outside, dry aging under bright lights.  Looks like something out of Dexter.  We made an Open Table Reservation and we were seated right on time.  It took a few minutes to be acknowledged after we sat down, but our waiter was pleasant and fun once he arrived.    I ordered the Filet and my boyfriend ordered the Dry Aged New York Sirloin.  Both our steaks were the wrong temperature.  I don't normally eat meat, so an under cooked steak is cringe-worthy to me.  I toughed through it because we needed to be at a concert.  The soup I ordered was a beer cheese soup and it was probably the highlight of my meal, along with the side of mushrooms I ordered.  The asparagus tasted like pure butter and they were cold.  Then a family sat down next to us and we watched a little kid eat a filet with ketchup.. oh boy.  It was cute that the waiter cut the steak for him though.  Man Vs. Food challenge:  Food wins!  Defeated my friend Geno, but made a homeless man on the bridge grin from ear to ear.  He was eating good that night.",

Kudo's to management for going out of their way to make things right.",

    "text": "We decided to try out Gallagher's Steakhouse since we were staying at the NYNY Hotel.  It is a wonderful restaurant with better prices than many other steakhouses & I was very happy with our meal.  The bf & I decided to both start with the clam chowder, get macaroni w/cheese and the mashed potatoes with garlic & herb.  We also wanted to split an entree since I don't think either of us would have been capable of eating so much meat on our own.  We decided on the the king cut prime rib...and soon found out that we should have chosen the queen cut to split.  =)  The Food: -Clam chowder = heaven!  This is REALLY good clam chowder.  It's a giant bowl of rich, creamy chowder full of clams and potatoes.  I absolutely loved it even though it seemed pretty heavy on the clams (more so than most places)  -Macaroni & cheese = disappointment; this was honestly the low point of the meal.  I like mac n' cheese to be smooth and creamy but this was clumpy and solid (not saucy).  There were 2 little pieces of bacon in it but we didn't care for this much at all.  -Garlic & herb mashed potatoes = delicious!  I loved these super creamy mashed potatoes...the garlic flavor was perfect.  It was a special for the night but if they make it available to you, you should order it!  -King cut prime rib = ginormous slab of beef!  It was quite good but in my mind, I wasn't expecting it to be so large.  It's bone-in and I'd say about two or two & a half inches thick at least.  The meat was really juicy and tender...you could probably cut through it without a knife.  Had a nice, earthy beef flavor to it & I thought it was great.  The bf thought it could have used a little more seasoning to it but if you're one of those people that really like the flavor of the meat to come through then you'll be very happy.  **We split the king cut & there is no cost to do a split = awesome!  I know a lot of other restaurants charge some sort of fee but it's really wonderful that here it's not a problem.  Our dining experience was wonderful - our server was very attentive, cheery and helpful to us.  The total came out to around $76 for the two of us which is very, very good in my opinion for this type of restaurant.  Gallagher's is known for their dry-aged steaks and I saw many order this...and I would have ordered it as well but it looked like too much for me to eat.  I say definitely give this place a try...the NYNY Hotel is sort of loud but inside the restaurant it's actually very quiet.  It's small so I'd make a reservation.  =)",

Cut to dessert, the cheesecake is... well... not NY Cheesecake.  It's about the size of a twinkie with two small piles of graham cracker crumbles on either side.

Our steak was another story. We ordered medium-rare, as we always do, and got charred black on the outside and rare on the inside. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a steak house, how do you not know how to cook a steak. Also, odd thing, the manager walked thru the dining room and asked the tables on either side of us how they were doing, how their food was but walked right past us like she knew something was off but didn't want to hear from us. What a waste of money, we will never go back to this location again and will advise others to stay away as well.",

    "text": "Wow! I happened upon this steakhouse by accident since I was staying for a night at NYNY, a place I had never visited before. I was not interested in leaving the casino after a long day, and so I decided to give this place a try. I had the most enjoyable steakhouse experience I've had in Las Vegas, which is saying a lot since I've hit all the majors (Bavette, Capital Grille, Circus Circus).   Why was it so good? First, the gin martini was perfect and not overpriced like at most Vegas eateries these days. Second, the warm spinach salad was fresh and well-balanced. Third, the filet and creamed corn were just delightful in everything from presentation to taste. It was all so good that I ordered a cheesecake, which I never do. That was good too. After the meal, even though I had eaten more than usual, I did not feel weighed down or sluggish, which is the sign of good ingredients.   Another great thing about this restaurant is they have a very comfortable and well-laid out bar, so you can eat at the bar without feeling like you are in the middle of the server workflow. Lighting and ambience are also good. Five well-earned stars for Gallagher's.",

Example, the baked potato is the size of a small football and is meant to be shared. He really catered to us.  The atmosphere was old school.  Warm and welcoming. It was my birthday and they had a small note and two pieces of candy there for me when we were seated.   I had the center cut filet mignon which I swear could have cut without my knife. I asked about the king crab oscar and seeing my apprehension about a sauce which I wasn't sure about, Bobby said he would have the sauce on the side with the crab on top of the steak. Oh my goodness wonderful. The other three people ordered the special cowboy rib eye. It looked wonderful and all really enjoyed their meals. We had sides, potatoes, mushrooms and green beans.   I almost forgot we ordered salads that were large enough we split 2 among the 4 of us. Fresh.   I felt the prices were below those of Delmonico and the service so much better. Phil's Steakhouse at Treasure Island isn't even on the same level as Gallagher's but their prices are higher and their wait staff is the worse.  Part of going to a nice place is the food, the price, the atmosphere and the wait staff. Gallagher's nailed it all. This will be my good to place.",

Service is nice which she serve in good timing with giving good detail on the food since it was first time for me. I order 10oz filet minion steak with medium cooked.  It came out really will and meat was tender as you can see in the outside of store how meat is aging and they are serving well aged meat. Only my regret was I should make it cook the surface and make it rare inside if they have this good steak. Side of special which mashed potato with red pepper was also really good which I was getting blared with regular potato food so it was surprising food for me. I order cheese cake which was ok since kind a too sweet for me for my taste. I strongly recommends his restaurant if you are looking for good restaurant in Las Vegas strip and I will definitely will go to try my rare filet!",

Unfortunately I agreed with him, he is a fantastic cook.    While we see the meat aging, it didn't have the luxurious feeling in my mouth, you know that aged fat providing all that flavor?  There are so many steakhouses in Las Vegas from which to chose, that the meal has to be top notch to have come-back customers.

    "text": "One of the worst food and customer service experience that I've ever experienced!    So I don't typically review my restaurant visits, but I felt overwhelming compelled to review my dinner experience here last night.    On our vacation in Vegas, we really wanted to enjoy a nice steak dinner, so we decided to come try Gallagher's Steak house. Bad idea...  The beginning started off pretty good. We were seated rather quickly (5 minutes).  After being seated, we were greeted by our server for drinks. We ordered some alcohol but only a glass of beer and wine. The server was rather prompt with our drinks and taking our order. We decided to order 2 steak dinners (approx $50-$60each) with a side of asparagus ($11). Little did we know this would be the beginning to a long wait... After we ordered, we had to wait approx. 45 minutes - 1 hour for our food to come out.  During that time, my 5 year old fell asleep on my shoulder, we were NEVER apologized to, nor even approached by our server.  The other tables in our area were complaining because of the wait, and they were the ones that were being apologized to.  I guess the loud, squeaky wheel gets the grease!!  When we finally got our food. My steak (filet mignon) was definitely not worth the price and our asparagus was super cold. We sent it back and they recooked it (or re-warmed it) and it was a little better. We ate our food quickly because we were starving and just wanted to get out of there.  While we sat there and ate, I noticed the manager going up to the other tables and \"taking care of them\" but she, again, NEVER came to us. Our server was apologetic but that was as far as his apologies went.  We finished and got the bill and were shocked.  They offered no compensation for our lengthy wait. Not even a free coffee or dessert. Plus, they still charged us for the terrible asparagus. So disappointing!!  Needless to say, we will NEVER be dining at this restaurant again!! A terrible experience and a terrible waste of money!!",

Seriously the best I've ever tried. Wish I remember the actual name. Then he ordered a steak. I don't remember exactly what he got, but it was absolutely the best steak that either of us have ever put into our faces. The meat just freaking melts in yr mouth. It was so tender, I thought I was dreaming. Just absolutely the best thing I've ever tried. I ordered 2 sides bc there would have been no way I could've eaten all of that meat anyway. I got the Mac & cheese & the baked potato. Both were good also, though nothing compared to the steak. We got our photos taken at dinner by a really nice lady that worked at the hotel. The first semi-professional photos we've ever taken. Lol. We shared a dessert, I'm pretty sure it was the Vanilla Cream Creme Brulee or something along those lines. It was just perfect & the only thing I thought to take a picture of. Highly recommend this place even if it's just to order a steak. It will definitely be one of the top 10 best things you've ever tried. 10/10 would recommend. I think this was the most expensive dinner we've ever had, just the 2 of us. No regrets. Just so good. Also, the waiter, wish I remembered his name. Super attentive & just wonderful service.",

When you pay $100 per person ave in any upscale Vegas restaurant, the service has to be great at least. However part of the problem for us was the location of our table. It seemed as we were sitting on a street corner. Food was average at best.",

Bartender/server was a bit of a wise guy at first but with help from others got the job done.  Fair drinks poured, with a couple of Bulleit Rye's a great start to dinner.   I had a terrific ribeye that had perfect crust on the edges and was cooked perfectly throughout.  The wedge salad I started with was o.k.  Mushrooms with the steak were tasty as well.  Before my trip I looked at many different steak places as I knew I'd visit one but in the end was happy to have made a repeat trip to Gallagher's.",

Our server John was excellent. He was very informative, attentive and friendly. Our food however was not the best. We all ordered the Dry aged New York medium rare and every one of ours were very undercooked. To be a steakhouse and go 0-5 in cooking a steak medium rare is an issue. I under stand it's a thick steak and not the easiest to cook but I'd rather wait a little longer to get it cooked right rather than have it under cooked. Our sides were very good as we had the potato puree, Mac n cheese, and creamed corn. With all the other steakhouses in LV i'd be hesitant to return though after our experience.",

    "text": "The food was excellent and the restaurant did all of the little things right.  I ordered the aged NY Strip which is usually what you see in the pictures.  They cook it over a mesquite grill that makes the charred parts outside burst with flavor while still being medium rare on the inside.  I don't think you'll have any problems with any of the selections.  Might not be the best you've ever had, but you won't be disappointed.  I also got the clam chowder, very nice texture and flavor.  It's hard to get that balance right.  And the mac & cheese, which for some reason I didn't hold the bacon on.  I'm kind of getting tired of bacon.  The steak was $50, the other items were abound $8 each, total bill was just over $71.  I drank water only.  After the meal I kept noticing how the staff seemed to know when to come/interact and when to give me peace.  I went alone and spent a lot of time reading on my iPad, and they seemed to know when to jump in.  Other times they would refill my water without saying anything.  Hard to describe, but too many places talk too much and others stay away too much.  Very friendly, down-to-earth staff.  Nice decor; hard to believe you're in the middle of a casino.  I went mid-week and probably could have walked up, but when I called to ask some questions they made a reservation for me for 30 minutes later.  I wore jeans, their only real policy is no tank tops for guys.  TIP:  I received a $150 food credit with my reservation at Monte Carlo.  Since NYNY and Monte Carlo are both owned by the MGM Grand, I was able to use the credit to pay for the meal.",

It was beautifully refrigerated on display outside the stop. Just by looking at it, I started to salivate. I must say the steak lived up to my expectation, the picture cannot do it justice. The tenderness of the meat was perfect with being too overcooked. Getting medium-rare sab f meat had its own unique taste which complimented the seasoning really well. Each bit was like getting a massage on my palate by the juice that sprayed out. It was quite MOOving if I may say. The lamb rack was less spectacular as it was just average with a bit of tenderness in the middle but the outsides were a bit hard, probably because it was ordered as medium (who even does that).  Definitely would recommend this place as a stop after making some money from the casino.",

Soup of the day was split pea and ham - amazing! Service was phenomenal, quick and friendly. Caesar salad slightly above average. Had the \"All That Razz\" to drink and it was yummy. Finished off the meal with creme brulee which was absolutely fantastic. Atmosphere was beautiful as we got the opportunity to sit near the kitchen to watch the chefs cook on the woodfire grills.

Strip was far from tender and we have grilled better tasting & melt in your mouth tender filets at home. We were unpleasantly surprised at the poor flavor & toughness of these aged steaks. Based upon how busy this restaurant was, we can only guess it's a tourist trap without much repeat business. We are from Orlando - if anyone comes to the area, try Linda's LaCantina - you will see why Gallagher's doesn't rate!",

Anyway, my husband and I got the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. It was good. Then I got the aged NY cooked medium made Oscar style with a side of green beans. My husband got the prime rib and baked potato. He loved the baked potato and said his prime rib was good. I though the flavor of my NY steak was good once I got to the center of it. Around the edges it was cooked pretty well done and it was kind of tough to cut and chew. The crab on top was ok, I got shell pieces in almost every bite so that wasn't pleasant. The green beans were cooked perfectly, but it tasted like they cook them in Lipton onion soup mix. I would rather have has them plain. Overall, I'm glad we went and had a nice dinner. Service was really good. We probably won't go back, but I don't regret eating here at all.",

I have no idea why but he was all friendly and smiling to the table right next to us and checks up on them like couple times and never came to us and when he took our order or we asked something you could tell on his face that he didnt like us. Maybe because we are asian and thinks we dont tip well or maybe its because we \"shared\" an entree and appetizer and a salad??? but that is NOT a reason to treat us that way. And plus it was still too much food for us. I usually tip very well (over 20%) but only tipped 10% and left a note on the back. I was very annoyed and felt discriminated. The food was good but overpriced for sure.",

As always, I save the filet side for last and it was so tender and flavorful the opposite side was fantastic as well but the filet stole the show.

    "text": "What a wonderful experience I had at Gallaghers Steakhouse.   First of all, you have to make a reservation. This is one of those places that gets booked fast. I don't think you have to necessarily book months in advance but definitely call ahead if you're planning to eat that day.   Came here for New Years and while the prices were generally $20+ more than usual, everything was simply delicious. We ordered the rib eye, prime rib, lamb chops, signature aged steak, Alaskan halibut, the seafood celebration and a salad. ($650+)  Every dish was super tasty, but I personally preferred the rib eye. it was literally melt in your mouth delicious I went to heaven status. The rub on that meat was amazing and it was just done very well. Then I would rank the rest in this order: chops, aged signature and the prime rib. The prime rib is a huge chunk of meat, and I ranked it last (although it's pretty neck in neck) because it didn't taste anything too remarkable, not to say that it wasn't tasty. It's also probably the cheapest because they cook a huge chunk of meat and then slice into portions as opposed to say the rib eye, where they have to cook each cut individually. The rib eye was just spectacular and memorable. Take my advice and order this if you're stuck wanting to order everything, you'll thank me later.  Another note, don't order the signature aged steak in medium, we made the mistake of doing so and it turned out just a bit toooo dry for our liking.   Our waiter was also superb, putting up with my family's desire to take a hundred family photos before we can even begin eating. What a great restaurant, every pennies worth.",

The service at the bar is A+ and our bartender Fernado was extremely on point. I felt like family from his service and was completely informed of what I was ordering food and drink wise. We ordered the seafood platter both the cold and the hot. Both were amazing, I enjoined the hot a little better because the crab cakes and calamary were so delicious that I could have eaten that as a main course had there been enough. The shrimp scampi was also very good, huge shrimp with very good flavoring. You also get bread while ordering the smaller dishes which was good for us being that we wanted something more on the light side before a show but something to soak up the drinks so that we could enjoy the rest if the evening. I will for sure be back here and go all out with a full course dinner.",

Not stupid loud (but loud),... just some 40-somethings (males/females) having a good time in Vegas cuttin' lose away from the kids and the boss. We could care less (truth be told they were actually quite funny), but I could see if you were on a date, or just wanted a relaxing dining experience how this might ruining your nite. The manager discretely came to our table and without drawing attention or placing blame on other guests, simply asked if we would be more comfortable in another room of the restaurant. I thought that was considerate and showed diligence and attention on the part of the management staff.   But we declined - we are a large law enforcement family and felt strangely comfortable. We did thank the manager for his consideration. Food is important, but service and attentiveness is too.  P.S. - The potato puree will make you cry... its that good.",

This is the 2nd time I ever had fine dining, so I wasn't really surprise about the price for 2 which came down about $160. Overall experience, we were satisfied.  P.S. If you get the wedge salad, you have to expect a wedge of lettuce with little dressings on it.

There are no words to describe how perfectly cooked this was.  It came paired with an aioli and a chipotle sauce.  As a lover of artichoke, this was an experience I will not soon forget, as it was such an amazing starter. We followed this up with a little surf and turf and the Porterhouse.  I am extremely picky about my steaks and prefer to have them Chicago blue, which they accomplished perfectly.  The lobster was HUGE and oh, so delicious!  If only my pocketbook allowed me to eat here everyday, I would. This was a dinner I will not soon forget.  I can not wait to go back, if only for the grilled artichoke...",

But for a place like Vegas, where the world's GREATEST foods are suppose to be prevalent.... well, you get my drift.  If this place was in my home town, I would have definitely given 4 stars, but the fact that it's in Vegas, I expect a little more.

I can't pick a clear favorite here, the porterhouse is magnificent, the prime rib is just devine.. everything here is prepared very well - among the best steakhouses in Vegas.   If you order the prime rib, request an additional side of \"atomic\" horseradish, and mix it with some of the regular stuff. It'll whoop your ass. Clam chowder here is really good too, not too thick, not thin, just a bowl of goodness.  For dessert get STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. For a while it was a secret menu item, but now it's more well known. Either way, get it, it's awesome.   The service is very good, if you can't get a table (or forgot to make reservations because you were too drunk), you can have dinner at the bar. The bar staff is awesome - and make one of the best Long Island Ice Tea around.   The case of meat is a welcome sight to celebrate vegas winnings, or to comfort a horrible run at the tables.. either way - make it a point to stop here for a steak dinner! 5 stars well earned.",

WOW..  i got the queen's cut of prime rib medium rare.  it was HUGE and cooked to perfection.  there was a choice of creamy or straight horseradish.  i had the straight -- the strongest, best horseradish.  see the theme??  THE APPETIZERS MARYLAND CRABCAKES delish!!  3 crabcakes with real crabmeat drizzled with mayonnaise chipotle.  GRILLED ARTICHOKE an artichoke cut in half.  there were two kinds of mayonnaise to dip the artichoke in -- garlic or chipotle.  thoroughly enjoyed this appetizer.  THE SIDES CREAMED SPINACH -- good but not spectacular MASHED POTATOES -- would have been better if they were garlic-flavor or horseradish flavored, etc.  just plain.  THE MEAT COWBOY RIB EYE -- HUGE cut of meat.  i tried some but my love is prime rib... QUEEN'S CUT PRIME RIB -- the BEST PRIME RIB i've ever had.  medium rare is the way to go if you are a meat lover like me.  i REALLY REALLY ADORE my meat.  and yes, i did finish the WHOLE thing.  boo...on not having ANY appetite for dessert.  i wanted to try dessert but so could not.  in fact, i had overeaten to the point where i could not gamble either.  LOL..  MY ADVICE: prime rib lovers get the prime rib.  you can share the king's cut between two people.  i would go with appetizers vs. the sides.  and of course, bring a GIGANTIC appetite cuz you'll need it!!!

    "text": "So we're in Vegas on St. Patrick's Day and made reservations at Gallagher's.  For what it is, it's pretty damn good.  Steak in Vegas is just ridiculous now.  With so many to choose from and rising prices, the days of $9.99 steak dinners are fading fast away.  (Then again, it's probably a good thing those days are fading fast away.  I remember one being less tender than the wood of my desk and tasting worse that I imagine my desk tasting.)    So my girlfriend and I got two steaks (the dry aged bone-in sirloin), two glasses of wine, a couple of cocktails, a Caesar salad and a side of asparagus was $120.  That's pretty damn reasonable.    The steaks were very good - beefy, stronger flavored than your average piece of meat and firm to the texture without much excess juice - typical of dry-aged beef.    I got mine medium-rare and asked for medium char.  The waitress said they can't do \"medium char\" - only \"regular\" or \"charred.\"  Don't get charred.  Although the waitress said that they don't put on a heavy char, my steak came out looking black.  The funny thing was, it didn't taste bitter like a charred steak does.  A little strange because of that, but the inside meat was good.  I didn't bother to send it back because I was with a date and didn't want her to have to wait for another one to come out.  And the steak was huge.  Easily 16oz.  And at under $40 (I believe it was actually $34), it's a relative bargain in Vegas.  The wine list is standard for Vegas - over priced and not inspiring.  But the wines by the glass were reasonable and of decent quality.  The Caesar salad was decent except for too much dressing.  Thick, good asparagus were used for the side.    Service was friendly and professional.  Just don't ask for their opinion of getting your steak \"charred.\"    But do get drinks from the bar there.  The shots are filled to the rim and the bartenders are great.  Three stars.",

    "text": "I really love this place. I've been here a lot, though not recently I must admit. The decor is classic NY steakhouse, with wooden panels and waistaff in black and white.  I usually stick with the NY Steak and it generally comes perfectly cooked to order. I've dined with people who have also had the porterhouse and cowboy steak (both good for sharing ... actually, they're all good sizes for sharing except maybe the filets).   The appetizers, salads, and sides are not spectacular and is classic steakhouse fare (e.g., shrimp cocktail, iceberg lettuce wedge, creamed spinach, sauteed haricot verts, asparagus). I do enjoy the spinach salad. That's not to say they don't taste good, but just not beyond all levels of deliciousness. The sides don't really bother me because the focus is on the STEAK! (please see update below re mac n cheese!)  For dessert, I like to get their sticky toffee pudding. It's very moist, sticky, and delicious. Some restaurants who serve this classic dessert tends to somehow make the cake dry. The rest of their dessert menu is very standard types of desserts and not special (though, again, they taste just fine). But if you're in the casino, you might want to poke on over to Il Fornaio for one of their desserts!  I can also count on the waitstaff for excellent service. I've never felt forgetten at this restaurant. The bartenders are also excellent and know what they're doing! Ask for a chocolate martini ... trust.  UPDATE 8/17/2009: Went back recently and they had a new mac n cheese side. It is HEAVENLY! You must try it! Also, a few people told us a story about the sticky toffee pudding. Apparently, it was the recipe of the original chef and though he has left the restaurant, customers loved it so much that they asked him to allow them to keep the recipe. :)  UPDATE 12/15/2016: Food is still wonderful and service is still amazing. Caroline was really helpful and kind! The sticky toffee pudding was still a hit at our table!",

    "text": "Probably the place I enjoyed eating at most in Vegas, though also likely some of the worst service I had.  Let's hit the bullet points. Steakhouse in NY-NY. Pricey, but not excessively so (especially for Vegas).  Great food, meh atmosphere, and while I personally had poor service, my impression was that in general, the service is very good.  My dinner partner and I both had filet mignon - very, very good.  We also split a side of mac and cheese.  Not only was it enough to share (though probably not so much that you'd be a pig if you ate the whole thing yourself), but it was absolutely amazing.  Served in a metal pot, with some kind of crust baked on top... I enjoyed it as much as the steak, and I love steak, and it was a good steak.  The meat also came with one giant potato chip, which I thought was unique, if weird.  Also, not the best potato chip I've ever had, but then, I'm partial to pringles.  My one real gripe was that we asked our waiter for information on the size of the steak - and we were told 20 ounces, with a large bone.  This seemed odd to us, and, indeed, when our neighbor's  waiter came by, he gave a spiel going through the whole menu, the specials, the sizes of the steaks,etc, and it was an 8 ounce cut of meat, which seemed to make a bit more sense.  I wouldn't have minded the nice menu rundown.  I totally had waiter envy.  Also, while fantastic, the meal was over a hundred dollars.  Not terrible, I guess, but we didn't have drinks, desserts, appetizers... even separate sides.  And the atmosphere isn't what I would expect for that.  It's dark, but not especially romantic, and at least where we were sitting it was hard to forget we were in the middle of a casino.  I'd prefer to have had a little more of an escape.  So, possibility for a great steak, and based on the mac & cheese, the other dishes are likely quite good as well, but not the place to go if you want to be frugal or want to have a special dining experience.  But sometimes, it's just all about that great steak, isn't it?",

For starters we had the shrimp cocktail and crab cakes both were good nothing out of the ordinary. I had the sirloin for my entree and it was tasty and tender. An unexpected treat was the roasted garlic bulb that I added to the steak and it was brilliant. My friend got the Surf and Turf fillet and Aussie lobster, very succulent and not over done for the lobster. We got the four cheese and Mac, Au Gratin Broccoli and Sauteed green beans were all tasty. Nice atmosphere inside like many steakhouses I've been to white walls and medium shades of wood with pictures of stars. It's All good!",

The taste is Very Unique, Very Gallagher. ;)  The wine list is also decent (I say decent because they only list the winery and not the vintage) and they offer a good selection by the glass.  I was surprised to find Justin Obtuse on the dessert wine menu.  (Not too many restaurants carry this one...)  The price isn't outrageous compared to other Vegas steakhouses.

    "text": "I enjoyed the bar here twice and dinner once.  Gallagher's is probably the best thing about NY NY.  The bar is covered in a stainless steel top and adorned with a chalkboard denoting the specials.  Fernando, the bar tender, warned me away from the special, a Green Mountain, because it was a girlie drink.  More so, it was probably a good warning because the co-worker I was with doesn't pull any punches and looks for the opportunities to take the shots.  The bar was well stocked, Fernando was skilled and they had Newcastle Brown (and a few others) on tap.  The next night, our dinner reservations got mysteriously canceled and again, protracted negotiations got our party of 15 drinks at the bar and the table in the back room.  The back room was especially cool, with photos and painting of pinup girls and starlets on the walls and a bar dedicated to that room (read super-fast).  It was a steak house menu - sure there were a few chicken and fish dishes for the people who will live longer, but the steak was to die for.  The waiter suggested sharing sides and we ended up delegating the selection to him!  The macaroni and cheese is great and the hot and cold appetizer sampler was excelllent - lobster, shrimp, crab cakes and more.  Mmm.  I had a filet, cooked perfectly medium-rare, topped with crab and bernaise sauce.  It was delicious.  I think that three other people had the same and others were jealous.  We had tickets to a show and only had an hour and a half to devote to dinner and we got out of there on time, surprisingly.  For me, the reason to come to Las Vegas is the good food, people watching and the good food.  Gallagher's is the place for it.",

Not sure if expectations were too high from friends recommendations/yelp reviews, but this was one sad expensive meal. We made it right around 4 pm which is when dinner time starts. I will say that the service from the bus boys was impeccable and very friendly. Waiter was nice at first but after he brought entrees hardly checked on our party. Appetizer was ordered. Minutes later waiter comes back saying how they are out of clams. Should have taken this as a sign and gone somewhere else. Went with second choice calamari. It was just ok, have had same or better else where and portion was huge. Ordered 2 of the specialty steaks ( aged NY steak), Mac and cheese and potato wedges.  We both asked for medium rare. When stakes came out, 1 was almost burned and way over cooked. The other one almost raw. Took first bite and was trying to taste the flavor...again I have had way better many times for a whole lot cheaper. The meat was not tendered, it was hard to chew and swallow. The Mac and cheese was good and potato wedges....well they were just potato wedges ( go with something else, husband was just in the mood for steak and potatoes). We were so underwhelmed, tried to eat as much as we could without feeling guilty for throwing food in the trash. Best thing of the meal was the cucumber jalapeno margarita. Next time we want steak , will try another place.",

I was expecting to cut it with my fork! Instead I had to saw through it with my super dull steak knife. Clearly this piece of snapper was not cooked to order. It seemed as if it was cooked hours prior and left in a warming tray until it made it out to the table.  Yuck! My boyfriend ordered the Cowboy Ribeye cooked medium. It came out undercooked yet very dry. It was a very mediocre experience as nothing was what we were hoping it would be. We paid $195.

I mentioned that it was his birthday and they offered if I wanted to pre-order a dessert and they can put a candle on it. Yes!   The day of, we were greeted by the friendly staff and our table was ready to go. It was a Saturday night, it was packed, and people who didn't make reservations were waiting outside. Thank goodness for calling in!   We were assisted by the waiter, John, who tended to our every need. Our glasses of water were consistently filled and never did we have to ask for more, even at half full! While waiting, a lady was coming by to take pictures to purchase if you like.   We both ordered the Cowboy Rib-eye, medium well, and sides of asparagus and mushrooms. They were cooked to perfection and the taste was HEAVEN! The pieces melted as you bit into them. I would have to say this place tops Ruth's Chris if you've tried them before. If the portions weren't so large, I would have attempted to finish it right there on the spot. The asparagus had a light amount of cream sauce on top and was very tender. The mushrooms were sauteed and was nicely seasoned.   After our meal was packaged, they brought out the creme brulee that I ordered and that just topped the night off. The top was had a nice thick crust and inside was very creamy and smooth. There were also a couple of seasonal berries on top.   The experience was wonderful, the food was excellent, and we were treated with such great service by the staff. The cost of the dinner is well worth the whole experience and definitely a birthday to remember!",

    "text": "I was pretty disappointed with the quality of steaks at this steakhouse. I ordered the \"signature\" dry-aged New York Sirloin and my girlfriend ordered the cowboy ribeye. My steak was entirely unimpressive other than being slightly larger than I expected. It was seasoned well but it was hardly tender at all. I could barely taste the unique flavor that dry aging imparts on beef. Not bad enough to send back, though.  My girlfriend's Cowboy ribeye was poorly prepared. It's impressive size couldn't offset the fact that it was a tough, overcooked piece of beef jerky. The seasoning (salt, pepper, butter?) was spot on but I noticed something was off when i saw my girlfriend trying to cut through it like she was using a wood saw. I politely offered to cut it for her and this is when i realized that it was an awful steak. I tried a piece and was stuck chewing it for a good 2 mins. At that point I was tried to convince her that she should send it back. She has very little experience with steak and didn't realize how bad it was especially considering the $42 price tag...just for the steak. She decided to keep eating the dry rubber because it still tasted good but quickly became defeated after her jaw got tired...about halfway through the steak. You might imagine how frustrating it is to watch a server clear away twenty dollars worth of steak.   We also ordered a side of mushrooms for our steaks that were very tasty. The two things that saved the night from being a complete disappointment -and subsequently earning them a single star rating- was the service and the crabcake appetizers.   The crabcakes were amazing. EXPENSIVE but amazing ($20 for 3 small cakes). Moist, delicious, and piping hot. Seasoned to perfection. Probably the best crabcakes i've ever had. Seriously.  The service was very impressive as well. Super courteous and very informed. It was almost comical how aware the waitstaff was of the dining area. I accidentally dropped my one of my forks and - being the neanderthal that i am - was just going to wipe it off and keep using it. Before i could even reach to pick it up I had two waiters rushing to my side with a clean one. I saw this happen at another table later that night. They also scrape the crumbs off of the table using a barbershop-style straight edge. Good work guys!  Ultimately, I walked away very disappointed. After a generous tip I had spent nearly $200 for two people and felt a little cheated by the quality of their beef. Not recommended for steak. Everything else was okay.",

The lobster tail was quite dry and lacked a lot more natural flavor than it should've and the reddish seasoning on top didn't help at all.  It cost me 75 bucks alone!! Yes, it was a big lobster tail, but it sucked.  In hindsight, I should've said that it sucked to see if my server would remove it from our check.  However, he didn't ask how the food was, and I felt generous that night or something.   The mac and cheese side dish was bland as hell. Chef Boyardee could put out a better dish, which is really, really saying something.    The best part was the green beans which were very well seasoned and very tasty but way overpriced for what they were.  The portion was modest at best but cost us something in the teens.  I must admit that if it wasn't for their lavish display of the process of dry-aging steaks in the glass enclosure right outside their restaurant, I wouldn't have felt tempted to eat there.",

My buddies and I decided that the night is too young to hit the casino floor and we were somewhat hungry so off we went to New York New York to try Gallagher's infamous dry aged steak.   All of us were alluded to the 21-day, dry aged New York cut, that raw steak dry aging outside of the restaurant was just speaking to us. We had mashers and Steamed Asparagus w/ Hollandaise for sides. When the steak was revealed, I was surprised how big a New York cut can be, it was almost like a Porterhouse cut from some steakhouses! My steak was perfectly made (medium), and upon first bite the flavor form being dry-aged 21 days is absolutely present. And the presence of that flavor is still apparent up to the middle of the meat, unheard off especially on less fatty cuts of steak. I guess one trade off with have a wonderfully flavored steak is toughness. Yes, this New York cut is tougher than the usual New York cuts I have had from other restaurants. That's some tradeoff because for me, texture is equally important as flavor in steaks. Also their steamed asparagus were overcooked, less apparent (but still overcooked) when our server exchanged it for a new one. The machers were simply delicious.  Combined with my buddy's uber expensive Caymus prime red wine, our dining experience at Gallagher's was awesome. Yes, I would probably come back to check out the rest of their cuts, all of their cuts are aged (well, the rest are wet-aged) anyhow.",

    "text": "Had the chance to check out this place over the weekend and I'm so glad I did. Gallagher's is an awesome steakhouse. It definitely ranks on my top 5 on best steakhouses. We ordered the following items:   Cowboy Rib-Eye Steak 38- (5 stars) OMG, this steak was HUGE, bone in and all had to call for some back up!!! This was definitely a bite out of heaven. It was extremely tender and grilled to perfection. I was definitely a happy camper.   Queen Cut Prime Rib of Beef 32-(5 stars) Originally, we were eyeing the King Cut but that was WAY too much cow. The Queen Cut is a pretty generous portion. I was able to sample it and I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually tasty and extremely tender.   Sides:  Loaded Mashed Potatoes 8 - (3 stars) This consisted of Yukon Gold Mashed potatoes with sour cream, butter, chives and cheese. It was OK, I've tasted better.   Fresh Steamed Asparagus 9 -(3 stars) Cooked just right but didn't care for the hollandaise sauce that it was topped with.   Dessert:  English Toffee Pudding Cake 8- (4stars) This sticky toffee and moist cake was superb!   Creme Brulee 8 - (4 stars) This was made just right, not too sweet and the right texture.   Nice atmosphere and great staff. Great value for your money for this dining experience . This place is a must see.",

The mushrooms are sauteed and served on field greens. Loved it.",

We were seated within literally minutes and the New York strip was amazing. I've never had dry aged before and it was definitely a delight. The highlight though was not the food, but the staff. We were served promptly, treated with patience, and the staff was very attentive without being overbearing. Kana was our waiter and seemed as if he wants to earn our business, and simply not just a tip. I was surprised too at the fact that even the manager came by, Randy. He and Kana were on the same page and we appreciated the recommendations they both offered, without trying to sell us on the most expensive items. They made it seem genuine. Randy even created conversation with us and made it a personal experience. My experience with this establishment has been shared to my friends and family and it will definitely see me return to the restaurant again. Thank you Kana, and Randy for the great experience.",

Service quality drops throughout dinner, but initially they are refilling water, folding napkins if you walk away to wash hands,etc.  Clam Chowder was chunky and well prepared.  Steaks are some of the best I have ever eaten.  French Fries are not plain steak fries as listed, but are well seasoned well fried and served with a steak sauce infused ketchup. Asparagus makes another fine side.  Desserts are \"ok\" and coffee refills are somewhat slow, but steaks are awesome.  Also had the Australian Lobster tail in '08 and it was great.",

The wedge salad was very good, excellent blue cheese dressing.  We ordered the 4 Cheese Mac and Cheese and Broccoli au Gratin.  The Mac and Cheese was pretty good but not outstanding.  The Broccoli au Gratin was just broccoli with a cheese sauce,  we expected a baked broccoli and cheese dish.  The steaks were not good at all.  The first steaks they brought out were barely warm, I was very disappointed to see they both had been smothered in a brown gravy like sauce.   The waiter took them back to reheat them and when he brought them back they were basically the same.  He took those back and brought two new ones out about 10 minutes later, these were hotter but still not what I would expect for a 35-50 dollar steak.  If I had known the steaks were sauced/gravied here I would have never eaten here.  This should be disclosed on the menu.",

Coincidentally, it happened to be the featured item on the menu.  All other options were wet-aged, which I'm not a huge fan of.  Wine selection is somewhat limited.  Sides were what you can expect from a joint like this.  The four stars is mainly for the quality of beef and perfectly grilled to order.  This is a convenient spot for a nice dinner if you're staying in the hotel.  Availability shouldn't be a problem since it's nearly always empty.  But, if you're looking to go big and willing to travel. . . there are much better steak joints on the strip at the same price point.",

Excellent food there.   The service here though was terrible. Actually, I'll change that to our waiter was terrible. He was trying to be very sneaky and add extra charges to our bill to make it higher. Then when I asked him about these extras charges, he would start talking under his breath so I couldn't understand him, maybe thinking I'd leave the situation alone. I don't believe at all that this is a representation of the other members of the staff here. I think this is just one lone ranger trying to be slick to get an extra few bucks. The higher the bill, the higher the tip usually. It didn't happen for this guy.   The food here would bring me back when I come back to visit Las Vegas.

Strange.   As for the food, I wanted to order some appetizers first but we were rushed into ordering main entree. But it all worked out because I could enjoy my cowboy ribeye fully. The steak had good flavor to it and I didn't feel completely bloated even though I ate two third of the steak. The steak had a light spice on it.

First off, this is not a cheap off strip restaurant so I was really surprised when our server a full robot mode on when she finally came to our table. Didn't even make eye contact. It was only after telling her that it was my first visit that she bothered to mention their signature dish: The dry aged drip which I wound up ordering. When my $50 al a carte slab'o beef arrived I was shocked that my steak had about 4-5 ounces of gristle. It was so tough that I actually checked my knife to see if it was dull. The server came by only once during the meal and caught me with a full mouth so I couldn't ask if this was the norm. Last time I saw her until she came by with desert menus. By then I was able to flag down a passing manager who left me feeling as though it was my fault for not telling the waitress.  Left me feeling like I was just another one time customer and that I really didn't matter. (This despite dining with an M-Life Gold level member).  Obviously the manager took a moment to tell the server my concern as her parting shot as she dropped the check was a curt, \"I'm glad you enjoyed your dinner.  Really sad because they lost my business and that of a regular guest.  Next time I'll go back to Delmonico's where they have never disappointed.",

How do you expect customers to sit for about 25 mins to get your appetizers....as in wedge salad?  Giving us a cold plate of fried calamari for free does not excuse the long wait.  On top of that, it took us over 60 mins to get our entrees and if we didn't mention we have a 930pm show to attend, I doubt we will get our food 15 mins before the show.  Do you seriously think we can eat our steaks in 15 mins? The rib eye steak was so tough to chew when we ordered medium rare and the filet was burnt on the outside being medium rare too.

Pricing appeared at a first glance to be on par for a great evening meal.  We started off with a soup that was delightful according to my girlfriend. If that was the only part of the meal I would probably have given it a 4/5.   We ordered a Filet Mignon, and the Aged New York Strip. The first cut in my Filet Mignon visually indicated a perfect medium rare, however, the first bite turned out to be a lackluster tasteless piece of meat. The omission of any flavour absolutely infuriated me. The steak was on the colder side (medium rare should not be cold in the centre, this was pretty damn close).  Much to my disappointment, I have prepared better dinner by purchasing a decent cut at my local butcher in San Francisco or even Whole foods. My girlfriend's New York Strip didn't fair much better. Tough meat that was was not worth the effort.  I don't think of myself as a food snob, but after today I question how I was served such a disaster. If I can make a dish better without sincere effort I feel cheated and therefore have to give a rather disappointing one star.  I sincerly hope some of the other reviewers received something nicer than what we received. If you enjoy steak, please don't go here. You will be so severely disappointed.",

But, the waiter said it came on creamer spinach and it was spinach leaves like in a salad. I'd give zero stars for the wait time of our food. Took 2hr 10mins to get our meals after we had salad. We had to ask 2 times for bread. My husband's steak was ok. Not exciting at all. I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "This would probably be the low-tier of the steakhouses I've been to. Service was great and all but the steaks weren't that great. Even though dry-age steak that was placed in front of the store wasn't that special.  It's probably a 2.5 in my mind but I guess I would admit this was probably one of my least favorite steak houses i've been to in terms of their steaks.   Bread was served cold and you are given sour dough and raisin/nut bread. I prefer the raisin/nut bread.   Prime rib : quite expensive for 45? dollars. I might as well go to summit house and get a $30 prime rib and they are known for it and it is bigger. It tasted so-so.   Filet mignon - To me, it was just a meh steak. I don't know how to describe it to you if you had better steaks before. It didn't stand out and the sauces that you pay for just covers the meat taste to it.  Dry-age rib eye- the best one but still didn't stand it. It's not as tender as other steaks as it is a rib eye given that you get a better taste to the meat. Would recommend it if you do choose to dine at Gallagher.  The sides- Mac and cheese was terrible, didn't have a good taste to it and was a bit too cheesy in a weird way and really overwhelm your palette.   Mushroom - my friend and I both thought it tasted bitter which was really odd to us...   Potato puree- it was decent. I feel like you can't really messed up it too much. Obviously steak and potato puree is usually a must.   Cream spinach - my favorite one. I don't know what they did with it but I actually really like the taste to it. I guess they add some kind of heavy cream that made it better to my tasting?  Regardless, I would take my money to OBVIOUSLY Craft steak at MGM or SW at Wynn. The service was still great and he was really helpful and kind towards our party.   I would kinda rank Gallagher and Prime in the same tier in a way just cause Prime is way too expensive but I'm sorry Gallagher you be getting 2 from me.",

No kids menu or kid size food which my kiddos were thrilled about so they stuffed their  cute little faces with bread and butter, split a calamari appetizer, Mac n cheese side, and I shared my New York Strip since it was large enough to share. Husband had the Cowboy cut. Both came out medium rare as ordered. Both ordered the Stillman blue cheese and it was enough for two. Should have just went with one of those. Loved the baked garlic with mine. Service was quick and friendly. Our water glasses filled promptly and table cleared off as soon as needed. Only downside,  they no longer carry one of the wines listed on the menu.",

I don't eat at expensive steakhouses unless I'm on vacation, so I usually just eat at local steakhouses in the Atlanta area. This was the best ribeye I've ever eaten at a steakhouse. It was cooked right and delicious. I noticed one review about the Gallaghers in New York being so much better, but I couldn't imagine how the steak that I ate could have been any better in New York. I'm going back in 2 months and I can't wait to go back to this restaurant. I love this place",

My most recent visit included Shrimp Scampi, and the Irish Organic Salmon. The shrimp scampi easily set the bar for any scampi I have tried in Nevada/Las Vegas. Onto the next thing that I truly want to talk about; the Irish Organic Salmon, me myself being salmon lover, I have tried many different restaurants takes on how it should be prepared.. and shouldn't be prepared. I would absolutely recommend anyone who enters this restaurant to consider this menu item.  This creamy, soft, delectable salmon that was prepared for me set my bar for my trip as of November second of 2017. It was defiantly the best meal I've had in a while.",

The baked potato was retched. Previously cooked and cooled and reheated a dark gelatinous mess. That was supposed to be my splurge since I've been doing low carb.

My wife had the the All That Razz which was a fun take on a cosmopolitan.  The complimentary bread was delicious.  I had the Prime Rib cooked rare and it is some of the best Prime I have ever had.  Our server Dereck offered raw horseradish and my love for horseradish I said of course.  They warned me the horseradish was the real deal and they were so correct!  I cried twice, went into a coughing fit once, and had clear sinuses after the horseradish.  My kind of stuff!  Wife had the Filet cooked medium and it was surprisingly a little over cooked which she normally likes so it was all good!  Our buddy that was with us had the Cowboy Ribeye and the taste he gave me was incredible!  For sides we got mushrooms which were good but the winner was the side of the day which was a cheddar cheese and jalapeno mashed potato.  Was also fun to experience our first earth quake while eating there!  Another great Steakhouse in Vegas!",

The calamari and bruschetta were ok - not terrific, but not bad either. Bruschetta leaned a little too much to the sweet side, as well as their marinara sauce for the calamari. The steak was cooked as per order and was really good. Great marbling on the ribeye and very juicy and tender. We topped off the meal with the creme brulee which was fine. Similar to the appetizers, not phenomenal, but definitely passable.  I would skip on the cocktails next time. Not to my own subjective liking. Would rather save that money and hop on over to The Chandelier in Cosmo if I want a post- (or pre-) dinner drink.",

The main entree was a 18-20 oz Pork Chop and the 22-25 oz Porter House with garlic green beans and garlic veggies . Yes, those are roughly the sizes of these beasts. A carnivores playground on an empty stomach. I only ate half and took the other half back to the room for a midnight snack.   Definitely a regular stop when in town.",

Our waiter was very nice and polite. The steak itself was about what you would expect for $51 (Filet Mignon) and was not anything exceptional to write home about. I ordered mine medium well and would definitely order medium instead if I ever go back, as mine was a little too well done. Also had a side of asparagus which was phenomenal, serving size was 5 spears. The only complaint that I have about Gallagher's was that the bathroom was located outside of the restaurant itself. It was a little strange that I had to walk out the back door into the main casino bathroom and had to walk around to the front of the restaurant again to return to my table. Back door locks by a code. Otherwise, a solid experience!",

There was so much pepper on it it, it was inedible. The waiter was very apologetic and took it back. The second one was cooked so rare.... you guessed it, back it went. They threw it back in the broiler, this time burning the outside. As everyone else at our table was ready for dessert, I made the best of it, trimming off the burnt portions, which left me with about half of what I ordered!  Compared to several of the high end steak chains, this place was pitiful.  Doesn't matter how long you age a steak if you don't know how to cook it!! The only reason I gave this place two stars was because of the wait staff. If you want a good steak go elsewhere.",

Whether I'm with a group at a table or traveling alone eating at the bar, it has always been worth the trip.  This last time I ate at the bar. I started with a Martini then moved on to a dry aged New York strip with asparagus. I added a glass of Australian Shiraz and then all was right with the world. If you like your steak with a good char and earthy, beefy dry aged flavor you cannot go wrong at Gallagher's.",

I had a porterhouse steak with a baked potatoe and  side of sauteed spinach. The steak I ordered medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The seasoning on the steak was perfect, the portions are humongous. I'm a 300 pound 31 year old man and I could not finish that steak. worth every penny and the drinks we're just as good I ordered and Irish mule and the bartender knew what he was doing because it was made exactly how I like them the right way! if you guys are looking for a steakhouse with huge portions, reasonably priced and delicious food then look no further trust me you will not regret it, the guys and I didnt.

We aren't young pup's, have all been to 5 star restaurants before and the food here really ruined the wedding couples entire celebration. I ordered pork and returned it. It was tough and dry and totally inedible. My fiance and another woman at our table had the new york strip steak. They struggled so hard to cut the steak that their fingers were sore. It was 75% inedible, tons of fat and hardly any good meat.  When I asked to speak to the manager in private (didn't want to damper the reception), the young manager came to the table and proceeded to get into an argument with us. He said it was our fault and that most of the steak was eaten. He even went so far as to say we didn't know our steaks and should have ordered a filet instead. After 10 minutes of trying to discuss this away from the table, he said he would comp one of the steaks. But when the bill came, he didn't.  In the day when there are tons of restaurants to choose from, times are tough, he should have been more accommodating to his customers who were spending almost $2000 on a meal for a special occasion. He was abrasive, rude and demeaning to customers. will never go there again.",

Everything was cooked perfectly and the sides were great compliments to the main dish.   The staff was very polite and there was no wait for a table (given we went to dinner on a Wednesday night, but still..).  The only down side may be the location of the bathroom facilities. You have to walk out a door on the side of the dining room to get to the restrooms and then walk back around to re-enter the restaurant. Needless to say, I got lost for a few minutes, but I eventually made my way back in.  Nevertheless, a great dining experience!",

    "text": "\"I must.  I must.  I must INCREASE MY BUST!\"  And I squeeezed.  And I flexed.  And I waited.  And I waited...  18 I was (3 years ago...ok fine, 4...and then some), and the twin peaks were like small mounds.  The other girls were wearing big bountiful lacy things and I still hadn't outgrown my sports bra.  They had told me that I must do my exercises.  So exercise I did...religiously.  ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DT3TZB3upHZY&s=91f8a464f4a4701c9fdf26721530b81ab678a11ae202222f014f404895476d4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=T3TZ...</a> )  The only thing the Bust Song and dance ever accomplished was a deflated ego and an increase in my pectoral muscles.  When the realization came that I was gonna need a bro instead of a bra, ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwfONNfAjyrc&s=0eb44ee960ce62e0ebbd049c387915ec1e54404a1b87864d36aeeedfbc5dd280\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=wfON...</a> ) the insanity stopped.  Naive much?  Yes.  ENTER:  Gallagher's Steakhouse's beautifully dry aged, bright scarlet, marbled beef displayed in a sealed glass case for all passersby to admire.  It's like that gorgeous girl you had your eyes on but just wanted to look at, not really converse with.  Why?  Because she just didn't taste as good as she looked.  Wait.  I'm still talking about the cow.  Right.  The Signature New York Steak is dry aged for 21 days in order to allow the flavors to seep in.  Although somewhat flavorful, it's rather tough even when served medium rare.  Try it with the accompanied sauces ($3 each).  We liked the Brandied Peppercorn served in a gravy boat.  The peppercorn provides that perfect kick along with the brandy reduction.    Although the restaurant advertises the signature steaks displayed in their case, it's really nothing more than a good marketing ploy.  The mystery of dry aged beef to be more wonderful in flavor is as appealing as ExtenZe for Men.  In the end, it's nothing more than a stiff wind.  The True star of the evening was the 18 oz Cowboy Ribeye.  Sure, it was bigger than my face, but I rode that cowboy like any good cowgirl would...right into the sunset.  Each bite exploded with flavor.  It was tender, robust, and served with crispy string onions which was the perfect accompaniment.  Service was very attentive and friendly, which earned them an extra star.  Overall, a decent steakhouse though a bit gimmicky.  When Suzanne Somers told me that I could have buns of steel, I took a beating with the Thigh Master.  When the Shake Weight promised to revolutionize the way I tone my arms and shoulders, I ended up looking like I was JACKING. SOMEONE. OFF.  Yes, I fall for gimmicks as much as the guy who bought that Snuggie to free his hands for the remote (as well as \"other\" activities - notably after popping his ExtenZe pill).  Gallagher's may not have really lived up to the hype, but its marketing genius keeps people like me coming in, in hopes that the product really will deliver.  Every now and then, it's good to keep the hope alive for us infomercial-suckers.  Perhaps one day, I will learn that The Clapper cannot clap off an idiot.  That my ChiaPet will not play fetch.  That I may not \"increase my bust\" by squeezing my arms across my chest...  But like my breastesses, these hopes and dreams, though late to bloom, would one day become reality...however small and humble.  You just gotta believe...preferably with a Visa or MasterCard ready in hand.",

Alas, not everyone at my table enjoyed their food, so I shall proceed with the 4 star rating.  Steak was great and the restaurant was accommodating since we pushed back our reservation an hour. The rib eye was huge, (18 oz.) and I was glad with my decision to share it. I always order my steaks medium- rare and more often then not they come out on the medium side instead of the rare side. Gallagher's however, did a great job at nailing the perfect medium-rare. For sides we ordered creamed spinach, broccoli au gratin and mac n cheese. All were fantastic but if you have an aversion to bacon for whatever reason, they put it in their mac. I however, love bacon and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My friend ordered the sea bass, which was their special and it came out quite overdone. We informed the waiter and he took it back immediately, but then shortly after proceeded to tell us thats how ALL the sea bass were coming out. We found this a bit odd but she settled on some salmon and he brought her an extra side of mac to make up for it.  In conclusion, Gallagher's is a very good steakhouse. Is it the best? Likely not, but I'll have to investigate a bit further to find out...",

    "text": "My husband and I went to dinner while on a quick trip to Vegas last week.  We have vistited a few different steakhouse's and know what we like.  Where to start.....  We had a last minute reservation for 7:15, and were seated promptly in the very back room, tables packed in and noise level was like a bar.  We could barely have a conversation, which really detracts from any sort of dinner.  Our server was nice enough, but the guy filling the water and bringing out the bread had a really bad attitude.  He threw the bread on our table, knocking one of the knives off the bread plate.  Brought our water, when I said \"thank you\" he just walked away, he appeared to be like that with every table around us.  Then a lady taking pictures came over and asked if we wanted our photo taken for a fee.....um no.  I don't like being solicited while at a dinner that is going to cost upwards of $200, the first time she came around I was polite, but then she came around again, that time I was not so polite.  If I want a pic taken I can get out my phone or camera for free!  I ordered a couple of cocktails, they were fine, but could have had a little more alcohol in them.  I am paying $11 for a drink, I expect to taste the booze!  We had the king crab cocktail which was good.  My husband ordered the Cowboy steak medium rare, it came out almost raw in spots.  He likes them very pink and bloody, but this was just plain raw, he gave me a piece and I could not even eat it, he found a piece I could try and it wasn't even that good.  I ordered the fish they had that night, I think it was snapper and that was good.  After tasting his steak I was so glad I got the fish instead!  I have a general rule that if I am at a steakhouse I order steak, but in this case, I think I made the right choice.   For sides we got the broccoli with cheese sauce which was good, but for the amount of sauce that was on them I should have just ordered the plain broccoli as there was hardly any sauce on them.  We also got the mashed potatoes which were good.     I wish we would have just gone to Delmonico, which in my opinion cannot be beat and is our go to steakhouse while in Vegas, or even The Palm which you can count on for good service and food.  Needless to say, we won't be going back the Gallagher's, which we only went to because he happened to be staying at NY NY.",

We were enamored by his genuine care for his work and his results showed no less. Seafood for the spouse and steak for myself. Separate yet Chef Franco made them equally grand. He is a man of True talent.  Next, the waiter. A cordial and wonderful man who demonstrated rare and marvelous traits. A mind for the menu, he knew it without flaw. He easily articulated the intricacies of the food and made the best of choices for each of our pallets. One step better, he perfectly suited the best of wines to our meal.

I would have liked some time in between each course.",

I was totally amazed actually, how isolated they managed to make the place feel.  Even though there was a crazy Saturday night dance party pumping loud beats on the main floor of the casino, I could barely hear it at all in there, which allowed us to enjoy a classy steak dinner in a nice, calm atmosphere before heading out into the jungle.  Plus it's open way later than a lot of nice restaurants on the strip.  I recommend this 100%",

    "text": "We wanted to try a new steak house this time in Vegas, without just paying for a view. Read great reviews, so we stopped in last night. We didnt have reservations, was about 8 pm, it looked busy, but we got a seat asap! The server was with us right away. The entire visit was very quick, but we never felt rushed, everything was right on time!  The waiter recommended a wonderful cabernet for me, which was in my budget, and was very courteous about it.  I was felt like I was staring at everyone's meat on their tables! All looked perfect! Started off with a wedge salad. Very classic, best blue cheese, and great fresh tomatoes.  My husband ordered the filet, and I ordered the lamb chops (both medium rare). I've never had lamb, so was nervous ordering away form the norm. But both were cooked perfect and seasoned perfect! Nice char on the outside, pink and warm in the middle! Would recommend if looking for a perfect steak of any kind! For sides, we shared some mushrooms, very fresh and seasoned well. The brocolli au gratin was delicious as well. Sauce was fulll of flavor, but not too heavy! I have to try to make this one at home! Dessert..... no room left, I didn't even look at the menu unfortunatly.  The prices were fair as well. I mean, you'll pay for a good steak, but  nothing outrageous. Total bill with tip was still under $200, 2 people and drinks.",

We started the meal with a shrimp scampi app.  My husband had the Cesar and I had the gazpacho, which was amazing.  We also had the shrimp scampi for an app. It had a delicious warm spicy sauce..not your usual butter scampi sauce...  I ordered the queen cut prime rib, and Ben had the surf and turf with the hugest lobster I've ever seen.  I hardly put a dent in my prime rib..It was huge. I wish I could have taken it with me.  We also had the lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, both were awesome but we could not finish.  The servings here are HUGE. The food was excellent for the money (I think this meal would have cost me more at home in S.F.)  I think our total was around $200 before tip..not bad.. The highlight of our meal was our server Norman.  Norman's service was phenomenal. I hope he is working  next time we are visiting.",

    "text": "I have enjoyed many a steak in this great town known as Las Vegas, and each and every one was delicious beyond belief. It really (for me) boils down to the consumer experience. You're paying a premium price you should expect premium service. And the team behind the bar at Gallaghers did not disappoint. More specifically Shaun. The man, a tall drink of water and was without a shadow of a doubt sculpted in the likeness of Michaelangelo's David. The Adonis of a man stands about 6'6 with a personality that was larger than life. His initial greeting was warmer than Phoenix in July, and I felt as if I just stepped into the house of an old friend. He oozed personality and always had a poignant point about anything that was topical. Weather it be the latest sports scores, current events, or 9/11 conspiracies, Shaun was always on point and informative. Some might call him a \"jack of all trades\" or a \"renaissance man\" if you will, me (after the one visit), I call him a friend.  Let's not forget the other two fine gentlemen behind the bar. Diminutive in stature but not \"short\" on personality either. I think the shortest of the twos name was Gary. Standing (what seemed to be) a mere 4'11 was surely channeling his personal idol with his Gomer Pyle hair cut. And the man only known by a letter G stood a towering 5'2. He seemed to be the strong silent type.  This was by far the best experience I've ever had at a bar, steak house, or Vegas all together. This is by far the best experience I've ever had and I will definitely be back.",

The filet mignon that we had was absolutely juicy and had a zesty kick at the end of each bite. Outstanding taste for me yet! Everything about this place is well worth the price as it would be for a moderate priced steak house. Every dish has a particular signature touch like the Parmesan steak fries that were delicious and hefty. The dessert was so scrumptious. I had the key lime pie, which was a little too tangy, but great to refresh the palate.   Service however was nothing outstanding. The server could use some oomph but he did his job, so no complaints.",

He answered any questions we had and made great suggestions. Our food was ah-mazing. My husband and his coworker requested the NY strip. While prepared differently they both were tender and flavorful. I ordered the salmon. It was cooked to perfection.

It is definitely not cheap, but the steak you get is huge, probably even enough to share between two people. The taste and texture were on point, and although I realize that having the bone in is what makes this a classic, the tendons in mine were quite stringy and made the meat harder to separate in some parts. So I'd probably say the price is more for the amount of steak that you get rather than the quality of the cut (maybe this isn't as True for other items). Assuming you don't mind using your hands a bit, you can probably get more of the meat than with just using your knife and fork. I'd probably prefer to pay a bit less for a smaller and easier to eat cut of steak though.",

Food: I had the prime rib with bearnaise sauce and lobster tail, some asparagus spears and let me say it was all heaven. I am making it a mandatory stop during all Vegas trips. The lobster tail was alright, but the real game winner was the prime rib, it was on par with Lawry's in Beverly hills. Their bearnaise sauce I was dipping fingers in it because it was so on point.   Wait: We had reservation, so none.   Atmosphere: Your run of the mill New York Steakhouse.  Overall: If you want a good steak, I recommend it highly, if you feel like spoiling yourself a bit, come on down...don't worry about the money, you will gorge yourself so bad you'll just go back to your suite and say fuck the tables. I need a nap. That's what I did. The best time to play the tables is at 3am anyways when every dumb fuck is gone to the club or passed out in their room in their own vomit.",

Our calamari appetizer was prepared well (not rubbery) and the dipping sauce was zesty, but not overpowering. I had the tuna medium rare and my date had her steak prepared medium. Her steak was very tender and flavorful. My tuna was quite good and the plating was excellent (even those dining nearby commented at the excellent presentation). I wish I had taken the suggestion of the server and had the tuna rare, but you live and learn. The highlight of our meal was the sticky toffee pudding, which was the perfect end to a superb meal. The staff was very attentive and fun, as our waiter predicted my date's dessert selection. The excellent food and staff is reflected in the bill, but worth every penny if you're looking for a pleasurable dining experience in New York New York",

The waiter and surprisingly our busser were also very knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu and could  converse intellectually with the entire party.  The steaks were phenomenal; although I can say the mac-n-cheese was a bit 'chalky' for my taste.  Dessert could not have come at a better time and rounded off the birthday evening perfectly.

Specifically, Roberto our server was fantastic...very knowledgeable about the food (how it is prepared, ingredients, etc.) and the wine.  That said, the food was slightly above average at best.  I ordered the signature steak and, while it was good, it could have come off of any backyard BBQ.  The shallot bordeau sauce that came with it tasted like and had the consistency of canned beef gravy with a hint of red wine.  The side dishes were mediocre and even the bread seemed of store-bought quality.  What saved this from being a 2-star experience was my wife's prime rib.  It was very good and was complimented perfectly by two different styles of horseradish.  In short, I would not go back any time soon.  There are far too many other steakhouses in Vegas to try.",

All 4 steaks came out not even close to as ordered had to be sent back.  I've never seen anything like that happen.  They were all ordered medium rare, and came back medium well.  To their credit, they comped us on one of the steaks, but that was because the 2nd time it came out it was also medium well.  The waiter was really embarrassed by all this.  We also ordered 2 bottles of wine, and one of them was spoiled.  I know that might not have been Gallagher's fault, as sometimes you simply get a badly corked bottle, but given all that had happened it certainly didnt help.  On the plus side,  I had the prime rib and it was quite good, although certainly not worth $32.   The mushrooms I ordered were also good and the calamari was absolutely delicious.  However, given all that went wrong I would certainly never go back again.  It really was the type thing you'd perhaps expect at a restaurant where the prices are $16 per entree, not $36 per entree.",

I dined there this past NYE and expected my party and I to have melt-in-your-mouth steaks and a dining experience to be boasted to friends. Um...not so much.  The much reviewed rib-eye was not on the night's menu--there really wasn't much to choose from at all. My halibut order detailed an accompanying sauce and vegetable that did not materialize--or have much taste. Each person in my party ordered the lobster bisque--also sub-par and two ordered steaks that were mediocre.  My review of a restaurant is mainly based on customer service and quality of food. Gallagher's failed me on both accounts, though less on the former. I have no problem with \"Go big or go home\", especially in Vegas. But I also expect service and quality of food to be commensurate with the money I put down. I could have gone to Denny's that night for the same quality of food...you get the idea.",

I would say maybe that they just forgot to season, but my wife ordered the exact same steak (New York dry-aged), and it was the same as mine.  It was very, very, expensive.  The side dishes weren't good either.  The service didn't impress me.  The waiter seemed to care less whether you enjoyed dinner or not.  Our plates and silverware had black char marks and fingerprints (very easy to see) on them.  The girls working the front and phones were quite rude.  Take my advice!

Well, Jessica didn't seem to like how long this was taking me, she actually flipped the pages for me to recommend a \"blend\" as I couldn't decide what type we wanted, ARE YOU kidding me, so rude.  She didn't offer any sauces, explain the specials and was just rushed and rude.  She clearly wanted to turn the table and had no care factor.  We would have had dessert and after dinner drinks but we wanted to get away from her, seriously it was horrible.  She was the same to all the tables around us, I heard many a negative comment.

Everyone raved about the mashed potatoes and yes they were good, but nothing special. The prices at this place are outrageous. We thought it was just because we were in vegas so we were okay with paying however, after we looked at Olives in the Belligo hotel and they had a better atmosphere, cool view and their prices were a little more reasonable, we realized it was way overpriced. The atmosphere is very busy in Gallaghers and loud because they sat us right next to the kitchen.

This seems to be the only place in Vegas that gets away with selling an 8 ounce filet for the same price most places get for much larger...so I went for a different steak that kinda disappointed.  The sides were good, and so were the drinks when they actually got there (sssssssslllllloooooooooowwwwwwwww waitress.)  I still had a blast because of the company I was with and the jack daniels buzz, but I would really recommend you sit in the main dining room of this place if you go.  Its one of the few high-end restaurants in Vegas where you don't feel like an asshole if you are a regular person not wearing $3000 worth of clothes.  Atmosphere in the main room and food is great.

    "text": "We came to dinner with a few friends on a Sunday night and everyone loved their meal. The food was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had, and it was pretty pricey. It's located inside New York New York which is a fun casino hotel to visit.  I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the NY steak. We shared some loaded smashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and Mac n cheese. That sounds like a lot, but we also shared the sides with a few other people.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly and the sauteed mushrooms were delicious with them. All the sides were good, except for the Mac n cheese. It was pretty dry and lacked flavor. Even adding salt didn't help.  Wine list was pretty mediocre. I was surprised since it's a steak house and Vegas. I ended up with a glass of the Rioja, which went well with the steak.  Service was great and they were really on top of everything. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and was able to answer all our questions about the menu.   Food was good, but again not amazing. Very expensive. If you don't care about price and want a good steak, this is a good option.",

I was nervous to try an aged steak, but the server (Kris with a K!) was patient and informative regarding the process of aging steaks.  He was spot on with regards to his explanation.    The bread was airy but crusty (they even obliged me with a little dish of blue cheese dressing to try it out since we had chosen a salad with a different dressing).  The New York steak was perfect as were the potatoes and creamed spinach!  The food, the server Kris, the amazing Chef and the entire support staff were second to none.  This is not just another hotel steakhouse.  Gallagher's has ambiance, fantastic steaks and an amazing staff!  We can't wait to go back!",

I had a party of eight people with reservations well in advance. We were seated in a back room (not even attached to the restaurant) and stuck in a corner with a party of 25 very loud and obnoxious people. It was worse than sitting at a kids table at a bad wedding. Asked to change tables or at least sit in the actual restaurant. No availability, no apology from management...we ate as fast as we could and got out.",

    "text": "Gallagher's is one of my all-time fave steak houses in this beautiful U.S. of A. that we live in. My last experience was less then subpar but Brisa and Shepard from Gallagher's wanted to make it right and invited us back as their special guests to ensure everything was to our liking. We were first greeted by Jocelyn at the front desk and she walked us over to our table. She was very kind. John our server came by to greet us and filled us in on the daily special and took our drink order. Rafael was on it as well, he came by to make sure our waters were filled and cleaned up any remnants that we left on the table from the bread crumbs. The bread there is phenomenal. I try not to eat bread but when I do I will eat it at Gallagher's.   We started with the Shrimp and Grits appetizer. If there is one appetizer you order and you like shrimp, then this is the appetizer for you. The shrimp is succulent and cooked perfectly. We then moved on to salads. I had to go with the beet salad. Beets are great for the liver and the beets are roasted to perfection and they do not skimp on the beets. Wife loves the hearts of palm salad there. Then on to the steaks. The NY aged steaks are the way to go. I ordered mine medium-rare and it was cooked just the way I like it. The prices of the steaks are not that expensive when compared to the plethora of steak houses around Vegas. It seems like every hotel has their own signature steak house and they offer pretty much the same thing but the thing that sets Gallagher's apart is the nostalgia and that piece of NYC you would only find there.   The sides were amazing! The asparagus were about the size of bananas. Talk about asparagus on steroids. They were pumped up. I also ordered the chipotle cheesy Yukon gold mashed potatoes. I didn't want to share them with my wife. At first I told her they were the worst thing I ever tasted but she knew I was lying because my nose grew and I had a huge smile on my face after trying them. Do yourself a favor and order a side of mushrooms as well.   Through the years Gallagher's has been a regular in our rotation when visiting Vegas. We always receive top notch service and the food never leaves us in doubt. All of the employees are wonderful. I wish we could eat there more often but it's great to have it as a special place for us to visit. If you are in the area just stop by and try something. You will not be disappointed and if you are I am sure they will make it right. Thanks again to the staff at Gallagher's and to Brisa and Shepard for making sure the meal was to our liking. It was nice to also see Roxanna who goes around to take photos. She took our photo 10 years ago after we had a post wedding dinner party there. We decided to go with another round of photos and told her we would see her in another 10 years. And thanks again to John for wonderful service. Happy eating!",

    "text": "We had a problem tonight at Gallaghers that was fixed through a team approach by an incredible waiter and an intrepid manager.  I also had my crab fingered...but I digress.  Gallagher's is a familiar and frequent stop when we are in Vegas.  We've hosted friends and family there, because of the excellent food, ambience and let's face it, it's damned impressive.  Tonight, there was a bit of a problem.  The surf and turf dish that I ordered included a pound of King Crab Legs that I attacked as if it owed me money.  That is..until I found several cold spots in what should have been a steaming pile of decapod crustacean destined for drawn butter.  \"Touch it\", I implored my wife.  \"What??\" she asked incredulously, thinking my sudden ardor totally inappropriate.  \"The crab.  Touch it, it's cold.\"  She reached out, and with a hesitant digit felt along the creamy meat.  Ohh...if it were only hot.    \"Oh Jesus\", she implored, \"send it back.\"  I shrugged and said \"no, it's okay\".  Then, I found the same in what remained of the crab legs.  It was now my turn to be steamed.  Our waitress, Catherine I believe her name was, came over all giggly and gracious (here was a real pro who can serve me anytime).  \"Is everything okay?\" she asked.  I turned to her and asked her to touch it, holding out the crab leg.  \"It's cold.\"  Well, this service pro went into action and summoned the manager.  His apologies were sincere, and get this...HE DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  I can't fault an impeccable restaurant like Gallagher's for human error.  Shit happens.  Let's just say we were made happy, and I got my crab fingered by the manager.   A happy ending indeed.  We look forward to coming back to this incredible restaurant that understands that customer service is a crucial element of a successful dining experience.  Five stars and a return visit next time we blow into town.",

You'd think that at least the New York Strip half of the Steak & Maine Lobster dinner would be outstanding, but you'd be wrong. None of it was particularly good and for $140 it really needs to be.   I should've gotten the hint when they had no dipping oil for the bread. Would have been wise to cancel the order and leave at that point.  Always follow your instincts!",

    "text": "Planting its seed in New York City back in 1927, Gallaghers since then has built not only a reputation with all things steak but perfected the quality and the service of their art. Being in Vegas there's clear competition on what steak house is the biggest in the game. Arguably one of the best, and up on the recommendations list with Vegas Elites; I'm glad I had the chance to cross this one off my list.   While roaming aimlessly around New York New York, weaving through replication of roads and buildings of the city itself, you'll eventually stumble onto an extravagant array of meat. Upon closer inspection, slabs and slabs of dry aged beef sitting beautifully in their window display.  Friday night with no reservation we arrived around 730 and luckily; no wait for a table needed. The space is lightly dimmed, tables dressed with white linen and walls filled with portraits and newspaper clippings. Service from start to finish was commendable, Each one of the hostess' and waitstaff were all extremely friendly and welcoming. Atmosphere and ambiance is set for a classy sophisticated date night.  TO THE FOOD!   New York New York - ($110) - Dry aged New York strip and a fresh Maine lobster. God, the presentation for this was remarkable. Arriving table side on a trolley, all eyes turn and are fixated on that glistening piece of meat with a gigantic lobster right beside, shell and all. The color from the two is enough to make your mouth water. As you try to comprehend how you're about to attack this monstrosity of a plate, the gracious server tells you to give him a second as he deshells the lobster for you, yes please, thank you. Enough bells and whistles, the lobster tasted like no other lobster I've had before. Without even needing to use the butter on the side, the meat was juicy and sweet and tasted unbelievably fresh. I'm sure fresh, considering how he just deshelled the thing beside me. Now to the second part of the show. The New York strip, grass fed, dry aged for 21 days, served medium rare with the bone in. This beautiful thing has changed the way I look at steak forever. I've aquired what I thought was a \"beefy\" flavor to a more intensified beefy flavor, each bite was so juicy. I don't know, perfect is the closest description I can sum up for this gigantic plate.   Dry Aged New York Strip - ($46) - Yeah, we ordered this too, we didn't think portions were going to be this massive. Probably would have been good thought to share. BUT THIS WAS COOKED PERFECTLY TOO. Like honestly, portion sizes are damn well worth it here.   Petaluma Free Range Chicken -($28) - Who orders a chicken dish at a steakhouse you ask? My sister. This was pretty good too, but I mean, I was devouring a steak, so a juicy bite of chicken has got nothing on the steak.   Green Beans -($9) - Simply sauteed with garlic; this dish- our only green dish, was a nice little reassurance that we too, eat greens.   Four Cheese Macaroni - ($10) - Creamy and decadent; two adjectives you definitely want to correlate your macaroni dish to.  Seasoned jumbo steak fries -($7) - Five star rating just for the fries. Yes even at a fine dining establishment, if fries are on the menu you better believe I'll be ordering. Nice crispy layer while you have a velvety potato mush in the middle followed with the seasoning and the added dust of cheese on top. Good god, bless this dish and bless my stomach for ever had consumed this. I'm not over exaggerating. You need to try this.   Clear as water that I'm blown away with my dinner here. Setting, service and food all 5 stars. No complaints. Most memorable meal during my Vegas trip.",

I believe the waiter knew this because he offered to take them all back as they were being placed, but given that we had waited for around an hour to get them, we didn't really want to stick around much longer.  The sides were said to be large and shareable, so we ordered a couple for the table.  The \"Yukon gold potatoe puree\" (mashed potatoes) could probably serve two people and the grilled asparagus consisted of 4 stalks, which is far from shareable.  At this price point I would have expected something on par with Chicago Cut or Bavette's (Chicago).  Also, I never really complain about these kinds of things on here, but this was definitely disappointing and I didn't want to call it out at the table and ruin the vibes of a good bachelor party.",

The steak was not juicy and definitely didn't feel better than a buffet prime rib.  The only thing I remember here was the clam chowder.  It is was probably one of the best clam chowders I have eaten.  My service was just what I expected.  When you pay 60 bucks per steak you will always get a level of service that compliments that price.    However, I did like their selection of alcohol.  It was very much so to my liking.  I'd come here again only if my friends wanted to, but there are many other places that have amazing steaks with the same price or just a bit pricier.",

I love creme brulees, but Roberto recommended the toffee pudding and sure enough, it was super delicious! It was warm out of the oven, and kind of fluffy with the excellent toffee flavor! I would have love to give Gallagher a 5 star, but the little Asian hostess at the front was a bit rude. She made no attempt to smile or make eye contact, or give me a proper welcome when I arrived for a seat. When she sat me down, she did not even acknowledge my appreciation. She just walked off. Well... I guess we all have bad days but, honey, you are in the hospitality industry, so give me a fake smile- I'll take that!",

Probably the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the waiter didn't tell us the size of steak we were to share only provided 4-5 bites per person.  I feel like he should have let us know we may prefer to order 2 since the last time we were there we ordered our own and left 1/2 on the table.    Other than that, everyone was happy with their food, we ordered quite a few things and all was cooked to order.  The salads were great, potatoes were great as well.  The service is always good as well as the cocktails.  I'm sure the next time we're in Vegas we'll eat there again.",

THey ahve some awesome steaks here i usually get the ny strip or the cowboy ribeye which are both filling and juicy and plenty of flavor.  Their sides are big portioned so i would just get one and share it unless you cant agree then get two and share both of them.    My boyfriend always gets the ny strip and fries and it feels him up pretty good.  Great meal to have before drinking the booxe for the rest of the night.  Haven't tried any of the dessert items yet but one day  i'm sure i will cause i have heard good things about them as well.  This is a must place to go if you dont want to get to dressed up for a great steak.  The atmoshphere is also very inviting and warming and it doesnt get loud unless you sit at the bar .",

I got the rack of lamb and again, it was cooked perfectly and so buttery tender. I had the beet salad to start, which was a great balance of sweet and salty with the roasted beets and goat cheese. Our server, Caroline, was attentive and super helpful in answering all of our questions about the food. We couldn't have asked for a better server, and dinner was amazingly tasty!",

First I must say is that the service here was Better than Excellent.  Probably one of the best service I've ever had in Vegas.    But here's the disappointing part... they serve USDA Choice Meat.  I didn't realize that until I asked the server.  Although it's probably the best USDA Choice Meat I've ever had in my life due to the dry age NY Steak, it's a far cry from USDA Prime Meat found in steakhouses all over the place.    And that's the reason why it drops 2 stars as the expectation level of quality meat wasn't there.  I guess you get what you pay for and for $42 for a USDA Choice NY Steak Dry Aged Piece.",

My son had to literally scrape off the charcoal coating off his steak! We brought this to the attention of our waiter and he never apologized but did say that is how they ALWAYS prepare their steaks (ummm no!)..and rather  embarrassingly pointed out another table that steaks had arrived at and said \" Look sir, these steaks were prepared the same as yours\" ...very unprofessional to put me on blast in that dining setting! This experience was rather disappointing because We truly & absolutely enjoyed dining there in the past! But with so many Steakhouses to opt for in Vegas, I believe that was our last!

Upon specifying that I wanted my steak cooked rare, the waiter gave me the always-slightly-condescending \"that'll be cool and red in the center\" speech before eventually bringing out a steak that was somewhere in between med-rare and medium.

Grilled asparagus and a garlic cheesy mashed potatoes. Best food we ate in Vegas. Will definitely be going back next trip, it's our new tradition we have decided :)   Also great service, our server looked very young, but he was respectful and pleasant, great place, and highly recommend .",

    "text": "We visited with our family for my husbands father's 70th birthday. The staff took us to a private room in the back. This is a traditional steak house and the food was phenomenal. The dish that I don't think you should miss out on is the appetizer of cheese grits and blackened shrimp! it was to die for. All of the steak choices were good, our party order the Prime Rib, Dry Aged New York Strip and the Center Cut Filet Mignon. I loved the horseradish on the prime rib, it was very spicy, but the steak itself was so thick, I felt it would have melted in my mouth just a little more if it was thinner. Sometimes less is more. My favorite of the three was the center cut filet with blue cheese on the side. It was perfect! Of the sides that were offered the creamy spinach and garlic mashed potatoes were a table favorite The service was splendid and the waiters were very attentive. The meal equated to about $112 per person, that included two drinks, an appetizer each, a meat selection, a side, a dessert and tip. I think this is a pretty reasonable choice by Las Vegas standards. They had a photographer that took pictures at the establishment and she was a True professional! We all bought photos! Which was a bonus to an already incredible evening!",

    "text": "Gallagher's Steakhouse is located right inside of the very popular New York Casino. So let's start with the ambiance....beautiful wooden floors, white table clothes, with all the silverware settings. It's kind of tight as you walk through, especially if there's a sporting event going on. My husband and I were promptly greeted and seated as we'd reserved ahead. Our initial hostess was very professional, warm and accommodating. As we were being seated our server pulled out my chair (my husband has an injured hand) and even assisted my husband with getting comfortable. My only complaint thus far is the restaurant is extremely tight, my chair was almost pressed against a door which separated the dinning area. So we ordered the crab cakes to start. The crab cakes weren't over filled with stuffing. There was a little crust like panko crumbs but the crab balls were filled with succulent blue crab. Please be aware, you will have a server but multiple staff will help you throughout your meal. Our drinks never went lacking! And even though it took a moment to familiarize myself with each person servicing us, they were all very kind, efficient, and accommodating. My husband ordered the prime rib. His only complaint is that he prefers it seared, Gallagher's prime rib is prepared in the oven, but the texture and flavor was dead on. Did I mention how LARGE it was. What stepped Gallaghers game up was when our server offered to cut my husbands prime rib. I was blown away by his compassion, service, and generosity as the restaurant was packed. To compliment his Prime Rib we ordered Mac and Cheese and the Sauteed Spinach. The spinach was perfect. The Mac and cheese had a chees sauce, so if you're a southern girl like me you'll tolerate it but you know it can't compete with over baked mac and cheese. Even if you cooked it like a souffle. Moving on I order the Porterhouse! My steak by far was the highlight of my meal. The cut was extremely generous, the beautiful grill marks, with a little blood drippings on the top. We shared our sides, and there was no way I could eat any desert. If you're looking for exceptional service you want to give them a try.",

If there is one food type that I love in this world its steak. I was excited to finally tryout the famous Gallagher's. The Vegas location is quite cramped but the service was very good. Our waiter was attentive without being annoying. I ordered the Filet Mingon. The food took an incredibly long time to come out. We sat for 45 mins before we had our first bite...that's just unacceptable. When the steak finally appeared it was one of the worst steaks I have every had. It was like they cooked the filet on medium heat because it was very tough. There is no excuse for a tough Filet. It was chewy and didn't have much taste to it. I was very disappointed. I make better steaks at home, so I certainly expect more from a dedicated steak restaurant. I will never be returning. I would rather go to Ruth Chris' or Gordon Ramsay's The Steak, where they know how to properly cook a steak.  Yuck!",

We came in a party of 8, ordered all different steaks and none of them were properly cooked, I really wonder if the cook know how to salt the steak. I could hardly finish even half the steak so I tried fed my dog with the take home part, but he refuses to eat lol. Plus, the service is really bad, we waited 15 minutes until a waitress came to order, and we waited for 30+ minutes for these terrible steaks.  this is my actual facial expression right now, nothing else to say",

This is serious man food (arrr arrrr arrr \"tool man taylor\" would say) Portion good, service excellent, drinks excellent, go in small or large groups they can accomodate most size parties.   I have other steaks all over the place and this is hands down the best that I have had in Vegas, HANDS DOWN that is a bold statement, it even comes close to toppling my all time favorite Bob's Steakhouse in SF..  This I can honestly say if you are a carnivore this is the place you want to be, rare or med-rare is super flavorful all the way through!!! got to the center needed maybe a lil dash of salt but still even after 15min the meat just oozes flavor, Man VS Food in this contest MAN won, only left the fat and grissle usually I dont but due to the size of the meat I had to make room.  You probably wont eat the next day til late dinner, for some people, try to get a lil starch in you just a lil and dont order appitizers trust me you wont need them.  food ***** steaks KING CUT MED-RARE died and went to slaughterhouse heaven haha price $$$ for the King cut it was $38 the Porterhouse was $47  service ***** cut of water is all you need and it remained full all night ambiance **** dark, gloomy, like all steak houses.",

    "text": "OK, I'm in Vegas for four days on my own two weeks ago.  Going to great restaurants is what I most like to do in Vegas.  My wife and I stayed in the New York New York a couple of years ago but couldn't get in to Gallagher's the night we wanted to eat there without a 90 minute wait.  This time, I was able to walk in right away without a reservation.  I was seated behind a short wall that shielded the view of the rest of the dining room and was right next to the kitchen, even though there were a lot of empty tables in the main dining area.  Since I was alone I didn't mind the seating and I enjoyed watching the kitchen operations.  Had I been with my wife I would have asked for a different table.  I ordered the NY strip steak, medium rare, sauteed asparagus and the heirloom tomato with hearts of palm salad.  The salad was excellent and the steak was delicious but not as tender as I expected for a dry-aged prime cut.  Overall, the steak was cooked exactly as ordered, the sides were delicious, the cocktail (Bombay Martini) was perfectly executed, and the service was excellent.  I would eat here again and give the strip steak one more try.",

When we first walked into the restaurant We were greeted by a nice hostess that took us to our table. There was a gentleman that took our drink order and told us our waiter would be with us soon, shortly after the waiter came by took my order I asked for my steak medium rare, a baked potato and asked the waiter what he would recommend as a side he told me green beans were his favorite I took the waiters advice. The food was amazing I have never had a steak as good as that anywhere, the green beans were seasoned with just the right seasoning and my boyfriend was very happy with his baked potato and meal as well. The service we received at the restaurant was outstanding the staff was clean professional and polite. I worked in food service when I was younger and was taught a customers glass was never supposed to be half full the staff was very observant  and they kept on top of our table to see if we needed anything  I had such a wonderful experience at this restaurant if I could kiss the cook I would  Outstanding all the way this restaurant is now one of my top favorites.",

Clam chowder was packed with flavor, not too thin not too thick. Just right. The Caesar Salad was good not great.  We split the 16oz Cowboy Ribeye - Cooked medium. That's where the dining experience all went downhill. When I'm at a steak place, I know when I first bite into a nice piece of steak that it should sing to me. Well, after my first bite, my first reaction was, \"this is not juicy at all!\" It's dry and very chewy. In fact my wife said her jaw was hurting from all the chewing. Not very good. For $48 ribeye it sure wasn't up to par im afraid. On the plus side, Yukon gold potato puree was really good and so was our creamed spinach. And oh the free cranberry bread was good.",

Maybe my expectations were too high because of all the good review but I have to say the food was mediocre at best. Maybe it was an off night for them but the fried calamari we had were a little overlooked. Then I had the prime rib and honestly I've had better at half the price. It tasted a little bland and the au jus wasn't anything special. Service was great that's why I'm giving them 3 stars but food was Ok. Prime rib at Texas Roadhouse in my opinion is way better at half the cost. But all in all not a bad dining experience.",

    "text": "I loved this steak house ever since they opened many years ago.  We celebrated reunion, birthday and anniversary throughout the years.  I haven't been there for a few years.  This weekend we decided to drive over from LA for a dinner.  It turned out to be a big disappointment.  First, the place has turned into more of a diner than a steak house.  The ambience is more of a deli.  The booth seat is so old it feels sticky and look dirty.  The approach made me feel I'm eating at an airport restaurant or at a cattle call.  I asked for a gluten free menu and 70% of the choices on it was not prepared gluten free.  When I asked the waiter, he said, \"oh, that Mac and cheese is vegan not GF\", \"No, I wouldn't eat that because it has cross contamination.\"  He sure meant well and I'm grateful.  However, the administration should take note.  And then, the menu book is extremely dirty and worn out.  Secondly, the matre'd was made up with a team of \"high school girl\".  They were more focused on chatting amongst themselves than paying attention to customer.  I tried to catch their attention for some help.  They looked over, made eye contact with me, and turned away.  Fortunately, a graceful lady employee walk by and gave me the assistance.  Thirdly,  the food was below average.  Not the meat quality, that was still good, but the culinary aspect or there lack of.  It was quite a failure Some dishes were better but the portion were cut back tremendously.  The price of Ceasar salad was somewhere $10 and you get about 4 oz, if that much.  The clam chowder came large of a full plate at $12.5 and all you taste was salt and better.    The bread they served is cold.  The busboy gentleman was so kind, he was very good server, and he offered to microwave it.  The bread came out warm but chewy.    The calamari was decent.  We had Salmon for about $40 for a 6oz portion.  The salmon was seasoned well but boring.  They skipped the touch of lemony spell this time.  The lentils that came with it was amazing and generous.    The prime rib we ordered taste fantastic and a generous portion at $50.  A cowboy steak, at $51, was a good portion.  However, it was so charred up that we had to trim half of it off as it has bitter taste and not edible.  We approached the waiter, he replied, \"that's how we do it...\".  This is called service?!! Pathetic.    On the side dishes, we had sauteed spinach, it was good, portion size is ok.  Our truffle fries has absolutely no truffle taste.  I also had a colossal baked potato.  It was baked so overdone that the outer layers are about 5mm not edible.    We had 3 entrees, 3 sides and 3 drinks.  The bill is over $300 including service charge.  As this was a special weekend, we also paid for the  photography, which was about $180.  We always tip well.  For a whooping $500 evening, it was a most disappointing of all meal and restaurant quality ever in Las Vegas.  Or for that matter any fine dining restaurant we had ever been.    My consolation was the Classic Martini.  It was perfect!  Extra cold, extra dirty, 2 blue cheese olive.  Just when I thought I will never be back, I may just come for that.",

We were able to get reservations on a Saturday night, but unfortunately or very fortunately our Drake concert ran longer due to blessing us with the MMA flight.  We rescheduled for the next day.  We found parking to be very convenient in the New York New York garage (both times).   We were seated immediately at the time of reservation. Everyone was so kind and attentive. It's a nice dimly lit spot..again perfect for a date or intimate setting. We appreciated that the seating was perfectly placed so that we weren't on top of other guests.  The food! I'm sure you saw the meat hanging on the window.. Dry aged steaks! I believe at least 45 days.  I ordered the Sand in Your Toes cocktail, he ordered the Pomegranate lemon drop subbed with Titos which Gallaghers happily allowed. Full bar also available so they have your favorite drink.  Pork belly for an appetizer perfect crust on top. So delicious!  We both ordered the Dry aged New York Strip. Medium. It was cooked to perfection!  For accompaniments: mushroom sauce, onions, and King crab oscar.  For sides, creamed spinach and the special of the day cheddar mashed potatoes with carmalized onions.  The cranberry sunflower seed bread!!!!! We asked for seconds.   I dined with THE pickiest eater in the word and he had zero complaints. NONE  Preston was our amazing server. He was nice, gave us enough time to look and order. Explained the menu very well and I truly appreciate him making this a great experience.  We had plenty of food to go. The portions of steak are huge! Our meals were played for us upon our exit. Preston even let me take my drink to go. Which I kicked myself for leaving on the table when we left!!!!!  I can't wait to go back.",

For this visit, they wouldn't give me a table unless I gave them my phone number first! When I asked why they need my phone number their reply was \"we like to be able to keep track of our customers.\"  What the hell does that mean?

    "text": "We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the service was exceptional.   We started with the bacon appetizer, which was surprisingly tasty. The ends were pleasantly burnt and caramelized. We also split a wedge salad, which came with just the right amount of bleu cheese and bacon.  The weakest spot of the meal was the bread basket. The bread wasn't warm or particularly good. I'd love to see them raise their bread game a bit.   For dinner, I got the filet mignon and enjoyed it, although it could have used a little more salt. My husband said the same about his NY Strip. Neither of us are salt fiends, so it's unusual for us to notice a need for salt. For our side, we got asparagus, which was the teensiest bit over cooked, but still delicious.   We ended with a truly terrific dessert, but I forget the name. It was a chocolate cake with ganache frosting. It was perfect and I want to marry it.   The meal was, of course, pricey, about $260 with tip. (We also had a few drinks.) but that's about par for us at a really high-end steak place, so it wasn't out of the ordinary for a meal like that.   If we come back to Vegas, I'd eat here again.",

    "text": "Take a bite of the big apple (well, the Vegas version) at this high-end steakhouse. Before you walk in, check out the giant Tomahawk steaks hanging in the window. No need to dress-up here, just be ready to spend some $$$. Good news... you can split your entrees because some are bigger than others. I had eaten a rather (carb-y) later lunch that day, so I was still kind of full. So, instead of steak-in' my vacation, even though those giant (brontosauraus-sized) steaks they were looked appetizing, I opted for the chicken dinner plate. Sometimes, I think chicken is boring, but this place seemed like it would do a great job on chicken. It wasn't a surprise because it was quite delicious! It was so much that my daughter and I couldn't even finish it all. She also had the mac n' cheese appetizer, so it was so much food for the both of us. My dad ordered the (brontosaurus-sized) dry-aged Tomahawk steak, which was massive! That would have been a meal for me, myself and my daughter. They are crazy huge. If you've seen the steaks that the Flinstone family has eaten... imagine that size for this. I would definitely eat here again! Quality was excellent!",

We would always walk by the window with all the dry aged beef and we would always say one day we need to plan to eat here- and we did!  The service was good and the steak was good. The creamed spinach was really delicious! We also got the crab cakes for appetizer and it was okay- I wouldn't order it again. I'd try something else.  If you like steak and are in the area, I'd recommend you stop by!",

    "text": "New York New York isn't exactly the classiest hotel casino on the Las Vegas strip, so I was a more than a little skeptical about this famous New York City steakhouse clone.    Well the marvelous, marbled and meaty hype is real, but it doesn't come cheap, as most of these tasty steaks are around $50.  Fortunately most the steaks are huge, about 18-20oz each, and even better is the $58 Porterhouse which is a whopping 26 ounces delicious and decadent filet and New York strip.  10 years ago a younger Chun P could've readily gobbled all that fabulous flesh on my own, but no longer.  Older Chun P couldn't do it alone, so Mrs Chun P also likes her steak cooked \"medium\" and came to the rescue. Our friendly waiter \"Kana\" didn't hesitate for a second to let us share this massive steak, which saved us about $40.  But we also spent $48 on bottle of wine, and got sides of the $9 mushroom medley(delicious!) and $9 mashed potatoes(good enough).  The porterhouse itself was phenomenal and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of char.  Even working as a team, it took us quite some time to finish this gigantic steak...so delicious!  For dessert we ordered the $9 chocolate cake, which was chocolately enough and a perfect climax to our evening(at least the food portion of our evening ;) ).  Not sure when I'll be back in Vegas, but if I'm in search of another classic steak dinner in Vegas, I'll definitely come back.",

The cocktails we chose was the \"sand in your toes\" they were good but a little sweet wish I had tried the pomegranate lemon martini.  The entrees were delicious and highly recommend the cowboy rib eye with mushroom medley and because it was St Patrick's Day they offered Alaskan Halibut with Chimichurri and chips with a veggi slaw which was very good.   We were too stuffed to try dessert. Maybe next time...  The service was great and I recommend trying this restaurant.",

Ambience -- darker restaurant, New York themed, one of the older styled restaurants  We were greeted by our server, who brought over waters for us and some bread. We enjoyed the bread and butter while looking through the menu.   We ordered Oyster rockefellers, beef carpaccio, porterhouse steak and the cowboy ribeye. Also ordered mushroom medley, cream of spinach and side of veggies.   We both had a glass of the Cabernet sauv -- California, was great with our steaks. Our appys came out and the rockefellers were delicious!!! I could not get enough of them. But the beef carpaccio was a little disappointing. Very meh, especially for the price. Our steaks arrived and it was HUGE. I did not expect it to be this big. Steak was cooked perfectly -- medium rare, but was kind of bland. I had to use the sauce that came with the porterhouse. The porterhouse was so tender, and juicy -- would recommend.   PS: there's a lady who comes around and offers to take pictures for you and by the end of your meal, she'll come over with them and try to get you to purchase them. We said no because it was overpriced and the pictures were so big. She was so annoyed and rude when we said we didn't want them.",

I needed a steakhouse before Coldplay concert and they were the closest, so I booked reservations and we showed up blind.  Best blind choice I have made.  It is not an overly large steakhouse, has a more intimate setting, the staff are AMAZING and the food was fabulous.  There were 4 of us and we ordered for appetizers the seared ahi tuna with melon and the calamari.  The calamari has to be one of the best calamari I have ever had.  Cooked perfectly, a lot of flavor and still so tender.  I didn't even need the dipping sauce, it was too good on its own.  The seared ahi was prepared perfectly and the blend of flavors with the ripe melon and salad was excellent.  It was light and tasty and perfect for summer.  For our main courses we ordered the New York Strip (thickest strip I have ever seen), The porterhouse (very generous), filet mignon and king crab legs.  EVERYONE cleared their plates, my son helped me with the crab, because the order was just too much for me, but they were SO good.  Our side dishes were the onion rings, the special that night: bacon cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Everything was very good, but the mashed potatoes.. WOW, I could have made that my meal and have been very happy with it.  I rarely note drinks, but the drinks here was especially good and worth browsing.  I had the cucumber martini without simple syrup and that was delicious, refreshing and just plain good.  This has been added to our Vegas rotation.  It is a must return to restaurant.",

She said they were both very good. I had Clam Chowder and then their signature Dry Aged New York Steak with a special side of Mashed Potatoes with Cheese and Bacon. Everything was excellent except for my Steak. I could tell before I even took a bite that it was going to be chewy. I had to saw on it to cut it. This was a pretty big bummer for me because I look forward to eating steaks better than what I can cook at home.   Some of the other steakhouses that we have been impressed with are Cut, Echo and Rig, and Delmonico.  If you are going for the Best Steak, I would recommend Cut from what we have tried.",

    "text": "Gallagher's was a pretty impressive steakhouse that exceeded my expectations.  Appetizers - Fresh oysters: Half dozen, delicious, fresh, quickly devoured   - Cold Seafood Platter: A few pieces of jumbo shrimp, king crab leg, lobster tail, and scallop - the scallop was my favorite, it was steamed and chilled  Main course - Ribeye: Medium, came out the perfect pink. Tender with just the right amount of fattiness.  Sides - Yukon potatoes puree: Smooth and buttery - Green beans: Sauteed and mildly seasoned  Overall a pretty good steakhouse! I would prefer Mastro's and Crafsteak's ribeye over Gallagher's but it was still a solid steak.",

We were seated next to a lady who was dining by herself, but man everything this lady ordered looked legit. So I turned to her and said you are eating like a Queen! Apparently, she was some high roller that comes to Vegas every three months and she only eats at this steak house. We have dined at Craft, Heritage Steaks, and Del Frisco on past trips, so I was very excited to try a new steak house.  Preston was our waiter and he was awesome! The next time we are back in Vegas I am asking to be seated in his section. He helped us with the menu and showed us what the more popular items were. We started with the crab cakes and the wedge salad. Both were delicious. Bread service came out and I really enjoyed the cranberry bread.   For our entrees we got the rack of lamb and the filet and lobster tail, along with a side of creamed cauliflower. Everything was devine! I was so stuffed, and literally for a split second thought I would need to skip dessert. That is until the high roller lady next to us got the sticky toffee pudding. And she saw my eyes on it, and said you had better order it because it's divine.  And with that, we closed the meal out with the sticky toffee pudding and I did not regret the thousands of calories we consumed that night.",

There's only one reason I gave his place 3 stars instead of 4. The hostess was a colossal and I mean a colossal B***h. We had 6 pm reservations. We showed up at 5:10 and asked to be seated early she said no way, She was such a b***h we literally were taken aback. Then she smirked at us and seated 6 other groups that had no reservations and the place was empty. We came back at 5:40 and asked again and she laughed and said closer to 6. Then seated two more walk ins. This woman should not be the face of the restaurant. We won't ever come back just because of her.",

Here's the breakdown:  Decor = 2 stars based on my preference for contemporary spaces.  This is old school steakhouse style without any soul.  They need an upgrade.  Bar experience = 3 stars for a decent but not great Martini.  Shaken too much so there were too many chunks of ice.  Crowd = 2 stars.  Tourists of all ages wearing shorts and T shirts.  Overall food = 1 star.  The bread was very stale.  The sauteed spinach was swimming in oil, butter, and garlic so much that I could have been eating any other vegetable without knowing it.  I should note that someone sitting near me ordered the crab legs and raved about them.  The steak = 1 star.  The Filet was bland and tough.  You'll see this in other reviews in yelp as well so you know they are not consistent.  Wine = 1 star for a terrible wine list.  Very few by the glass and selections are basic and uninteresting.  Ever go on a cruise ship?  Similiar selection.  Service = 2 stars.  The hostess was rude AND accidentally cancelled my Opentable reservation instead of confirming it!  The check = $90 for steak, side, martini, and glass of wine  Extras = upset stomach later that night.  I saw a similiar comment on another diner's review on Yelp so beware!  Avoid this place.  With so many options in Vegas, you'd be wasting your time here.",

    "text": "Made dinner reservations for a Saturday evening. Arrived and was informed that we had a table in a \"semi-private room\" which was a bit further than the main restaurant location and also had no restroom, so if you wanted to use the restroom, you would have to either walk through the main gallagher's enterance to take a shortcut or walk around to get it. The room we were in was very dimly lit (not sure if they were going for that intimate feel or just wanted to make you feel extremely tired) and already had a party of 20-30 people who were loudly talking to one another across the table. We tried to ignore it at first and thought maybe our server would let them know to keep their voices down, but nope. Anyways, we ordered our food and since I've never tried a dry-aged steak before, I decided to go with that (medium rare) and a baked potato. When my meal came, at first glance it looked like my steak was very burnt at the top, however, the baked potato was very huge. The first cut into the steak was very difficult, then as I looked at my piece of steak, it was cooked rare (I assume the waitress wrote rare on the order because she couldn't hear us say \"medium-rare\" because of how loud the room was). Such a huge disappointment, for a $50+ steak, go spend your money somewhere else in Las Vegas because they obviously did not care about us. I'm not one to complain about many things, but this was possibly the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my entire life. Would I give this place another shot? Possibly. Note to future diners, if you have a large party, DON'T LET THEM PUT YOU IN THEIR \"SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM\".",

POSITIVE side, the service of the staff inside were spectacular.  So I have to give uber kudos for that.   Will we go back in 2013?  Only if the group wants to.  I am sorry and wished for more....    ----------------  2011 Post  Solid 4 perhaps 5.    Go to a steakhouse and order pork chops, yup!   These were probably the best pork chops I have had in a long time.  The confiet (sp?) that was served as garnish was awesome, as was the corn bread...  I tasted someone's steak and it was very good.  I just could not eat two big steak meals two days back to back.   I heard no complaints during the meal or the next day.  Service here was fantastic (a little miss from the personality of the two bar tenders though....stick around for drinks after, they were really not the best customer facing folks, really need to improve please).  Second time eating here (first was little over a year ago) and I am looking to my third visit!",

    "text": "I've been here at least 5 times, and the food is pretty awesome. Ok, not 5 star awesome but just as good as any other quality american steakhouse. Portions are pretty standard.   The real reason I come here, however is their kick-ass-blow-your-pants-off \"atomic\" horseradish that every waiter is so secretly proud of. None of that watered down creamy crap that so many restaurants serve. Their horseradish is off the wall totally destroys your taste buds kinda thing. I can't even say take a \"pea-sized\" amount with a bite of rib-eye (my favorite at the restaurant btw). Even a pea-sized amount will have you screaming for relief.   Other than that, nothing more special in a 4 star restaurant. Service is excellent, decor is decent, and a great place to bring a date. Definitely expect to spend around 60-100$ a person, more for drinks.",

The environment is okay, the service was average bordering on below average, my $43 Sirloin was good but not STELLAR; whereas, my Filet from The Palm Steakhouse 2 nights before for the same price was exceptional. My mother's Prime Rib AND my father's Filet both had to be sent back back because they were undercooked.   I'm giving it a 3 because my Sirloin was tasty (just not for the price tag) and my girlfriend's Pork was good as well.",

    "text": "My friend and I went here before going to Zumanity. I am usually not a fan of eating at NYNY because the restaurants don't seem that great (Il Fornaio). I looked up the reviews on yelp for Gallagher's and it got good reviews, so we gave it a shot. I rarely eat steak but when I do I want it to be good. I had a reservation and when we arrived almost the whole restaurant was empty but the host was was having a hard time finding our reservation and took a few minutes to find it with the help of 3 people. I don't know why didn't just seat us, hmm.   The place does not have a modern feel to it, and usually when I am going to spend alot of money on food I kind of enjoy the atmosphere as well too. That aside, we were so excited about the bread since you usually get really yummy bread at steakhouses. The bread was the really crusty kind and flaky but soft in the middle, a sourdough loaf. Not what we were expecting. I guess I am used to the pretzel bread, cheesy bread, and all the other cool kinds of bread you get at other steakhouses.   The service was very good, someone there to fill your water every time you took a sip practically. My friend and I shared the cowboy rib-eye steak $38 it was very big. The steak just wasn't as good as I hoped for. The sauce on top was good. We shared 4 cheese mac and cheese and creamed spinach-both I enjoyed. But usually sides at steakhouses are always good. The portion was pretty small on the sides.   We shared a toffee bread pudding dessert with vanilla ice cream. It was the size of a brownie. It was good but not amazing.   I would not go back here. I prefer Nine, T-bones, Fleming's, etc.",

    "text": "Had dinner on a Saturday night here a couple weeks ago. We had a reservation and we were seated quickly. Good thing we had called ahead because it was pretty crowded for 6:30 on a Saturday night in Vegas.   Service: Service was awesome. Our waiter was a little quirky but nice. He recommended some favorites of his and asked us where we were from and made conversation even though he was busy. He was very attentive. Our water glasses were never empty as there was a guy circling the restaurant constantly refilling drinks. When I had a little trouble finding the restroom, an older waiter politely pointed it out and called me \"doll\". Can't beat that!  Food: Food was YUMMY! Crusty yet soft bread basket with lots of butter to start with. Husband got the New York steak aged 40 days and he said it was one of the best steaks he ever got. The guy sitting next to us said the same thing about his. I'm not a steak eater and I had the salmon and it was delish! Came with a side of quinoa cooked really well. We got the Yukon smashed postatos and asparagus as sides. It's a bit of a bummer you have to order them separate but they were really good and definitely big enough to share. The sauce that came on the asparagus was great. We got the lava cake for dessert and I'm not a huge fan of lava cake so I gave that to my husband and ate the yummy ben and jerry's ice cream that came on it. Next time we'll have to get appetizers, the couple next to us got this shrimp thing that looked really good.   It's loud in there but everywhere in Vegas is loud. If you want a quiet, romantic dinner you should go to Napa or Santa Barbara or Sedona or something. The people next to us were getting annoyed at the funny drunk at the table across the room who was telling loud stories. HELLO! It's VEGAS! And he wasn't rude, just loud. Lighten up, peeps.   Yes it was also kind of overpriced but it's hard to get that kind of quality and service in Vegas so I would say it was worth it for a splurge. I will definitely be going back!",

Last summer, while strolling by NY NY on the last day of our vegas trip, we walked by Gallagher's. Unfortunately at that time, we didn't have time to try their steak and the bf left vegas disappointed.   For the holidays, we trekked back to vegas...and a part of me thinks we went back to vegas to satisfy my bf's intrigue of the dry aged NY sirloin. So to appease the bf, we went here. He of course had the NY sirloin, and I had the filet mignon.  And to give Gallagher's credit...the NY sirloin was yummy, but it didn't taste that much different than a wet aged piece-o-meat.   The filet was small but cooked to perfection.   Overall, very enjoyable.   However",

    "text": "I can't believe it's been nearly a year since R and I went to Vegas. Despite the months, the memory of the meal we shared here is still very vibrant. It really was quite an experience.   We dined at Gallagher's shortly after seeing Zumanity. These two experiences equaled one really awesome night.   My meal started off with the soup of the day, which was cream of mushroom on this particular evening. I love cream of mushroom soup. This soup was just phenomenal. I would bathe in it if I could. The only bad thing I can say about it is it's filling. Naturally you should expect that from a cream based soup. I've been day dreaming about this soup ever since I ate it.   Next was our steaks. We both ordered the fillet Mignon and I asked for mine to be cooked to medium. I also ordered the red wine sauce to accompany my steak. I checked the online menu to verify the information I was going to include in this review and didn't see the red wine sauce. Nor did I see the macaroni and cheese I seem to remember ordering as a side. I was enjoying some lovely Merlot while at Gallaghers but I don't seem to think I enjoyed enough of it to have imagined the red wine sauce and the amazing mac and cheese (which came with a \"cracker\" of melted cheese on top of it- yum!). So- they must have changed the menu a bit.   Anyway, the meal was just heavenly. If I had to be picky I'd say my steak was a tad below \"medium\" but it was delicious so who the hell cares. This was by far the most amazing steak dinner I've had in ages and I'd go back to Gallagher's in a minute. Please open one in DC!!!!!",

Our server was knowledgable about the menu (even with my gluten free requirements) and was extremely helpful and friendly. Everything from our cocktails to the Caesar salads to my husband's steak and my GIGANTIC pre-split king crab legs was absolutely fantastic. It was pricey for sure, but you absolutely get what you pay for. I've never seen my meat-loving husband clean a steak bone so thoroughly. A table nearby requested steak sauce for their meal and my husband was absolutely outraged that anyone would want to ruin such an incredible cut of meat that way. Our experience was capped off with a complimentary scoop of banana's foster as congratulations on our honeymoon. Could not have asked for a better dining experience!",

She introduced us to the menu, talked about their different cuts, and took drink orders. While sipping on our manhattans, we placed our meal orders, both ordering the same thing - clam chowder, their signature NY strip, and the garlic mashed potatoes.  The clam chowder was spectacular. Thick, creamy, chunky. The mashed potatoes were good, but a bit too whipped for my liking. The steak - the signature wet and dry aged steak - was, well, tough and not all that flavorful. The waitress did recommend the ribeye (saying it was her favorite), and hindsight being what it is I'm thinking we should have listened to her.  There are many better places in Vegas than this one, including one of my favorites (Mon Ami Gabi). The place is decent, but for the price you can do much better elsewhere.",

The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, but filled in while we were there. The waiter was very friendly and it wasn't too loud in the restaurant. Unfortunately, I can't remember everything we ate since this was back in May, however, I do know I got the Filet Mignon and green beans, both were delicious! My boyfriend and I would certainly go back when we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "After a long day of wine gambling and Vegas walking it was time for some red meat. Made the cardinal sin of not checking Yelp before dining. This time it would have sent me elsewhere. Couple of caveats before we get into the food. First, restaurant is wonderful. Tables not on top of each other, beautiful white linens and a \"big meat\" size steak knife to boot! Really a comfortable atmosphere. ...Second  Service  perfect  say no more.  But...and this is a big issue if you are serving high end steaks, they were not very flavorful and a bit tough. I order the \"cheffy\" medium rare and while perfect color...not very good. This was supposed to be a NY Strip aged and I am thinking it was aged since this morning...... Sides were good but not the official steakhouse \"you could never finish this\" size but tasty. The sides could not save the meal however. My wife orders her steak medium well so I usually discount any feedback from her on steak but she complained to the waiter about how tough her's was. Waiter apologized,  offered desert but she declined  I ordered a shot of Bailey's with my coffee and they certainly charged for that,  but i digress.   Food actually two stars .....ambiance raises it up a star, but with dozens of great steak houses to choose from on the strip...I would pass by Gallagher's.",

We ordered the diver scallops which was very good. I didn't know that it would be wrapped in bacon, but that was a lovely surprise. Anything wrapped in bacon is in my good books. The prime rib was huge! (Might be wise to share) It was tasty, but not as tender as I would've preferred. The garlic mashed potatoes were flavorful and the asparagus (straddling on the too salty side) was cooked perfectly- not too soggy or crunchy. Food service was extremely fast for such an establishment. We were so impressed with how fast food was coming out. We were too full for dessert but there was a good array of options. The atmosphere was a little louder than I had expected but that was due to some loud neighbouring tables. We would definitely come back and recommend to others.",

    "text": "While I love Las Vegas, I have been quite disappointed in the food. I was hoping that this place would be a different story, sadly it was not. The place was LOUD, my boyfriend and I basically had to shout to hear each other which is what I would expect from a bar, but not from a nice restaurant. Our server was nice...when she would actually take the time to come to our table. It seemed as if as soon as we came in she pegged us as a young couple that wouldn't be able to afford a large tab, and therefore she wouldn't give us any sort of priority the whole night when she had bigger fish to fry. Their cocktails were very good at least. My boyfriend got steak, and I ordered the roasted chicken and I also ordered a side of green beans (at steakhouses like this, it is common for your main dish to not come with any sides at all). When the food came, my plate had roasted chicken, rice, and green beans on it, and another large side of green beans was brought along with it. I was a bit peeved with this as the menu description of my entree had not indicated that it would come with rice or green beans...or with anything, really. I thought that it was wrong of our waitress to not let me know that my plate already came with green beans on it, and that she had let me order an expensive side of green beans anyways. When I confronted our waitress, she was kind and apologetic and said that she would remove the green beans from our ticket. She then picked up the side of green beans and before taking them away, she said that if she had known that my chicken was supposed to come with green beans that she would have let me know. I don't know how you can work in such a high-ticket restaurant and not know if your main dishes come with sides or not....if you work in such an expensive restaurant, you should really know the menu. At least the green beans were tasty, the chicken ended up being dry, the rice overcooked, and Paul's steak's marinade was overpowering and not very good. Overall I was disappointed in the food, the service, the ambiance, and the price.....oh well.",

    "text": "In True Vegas fashion, I was with a group of guy friends and we were deciding were to eat for dinner. We said either a) we're eating at McDonald's or b) we're going to keep gambling until we're each up at least $50 and go eat a nice steak dinner.   The latter happened, and we ended up dining like kings at Gallagher's.   To be honest, I really enjoyed our meal here. We started off with the clams, which were AMAZING to the point that I wanted to drink the broth. I even requested the server to leave the broth after all the clams were eaten so I could soak it up with bread. Too much? Maybe.   In terms of main courses, the steak portions are huge. I shared a NY Strip Steak (which was phenomenal) with a side of mashed potatoes, and left full and happy. If you're picky about how your steak is cooked, I would suggest going a step up from what you usually order. i.e. I like my steak on the rare side, so we ordered a medium, which was really a medium rare.   Another trick to note: my friend wanted bacon and cheese for his baked potato, and our server ended up bringin out two large bowls of bacon and cheese for the table to share. Such an added, delightful bonus to the meal. Because in my humble opinion, bacon makes the world go round.   In terms of ambience (New York/Hollywood legends), the price (moderate), the service (great), and quality of food (outstanding), you can't go wrong with Gallagher's for your Las Vegas dining experience.",

After a quick look at the menu it was clear they were traditional steakhouse and I went for some green beans, baked potatoes, and a filet.  The steak was amazing.  Literally THE BEST I have ever had.  No knife needed, I cut it with the side of my fork.  The green beans and potato were also delicious but there was no question that the steak was rightfully the star of this meal.    This dinner didn't come cheap, but in Vegas nothing really does.  I wasn't put off by this though as I had dropped more on a meal in Seattle for a lesser quality steak.  When and if I return to Vegas this will be a place I visit again.",

There were 3 in our party 2 of us ordered steak & lobster at market price $175 each, and the 3rd person ordered aged steak and a plate of oysters.  As we were having dinner he mentioned to me while eating one of the oysters that ..'that one didn't taste good'.  I told him I'd call the waiter over but he didn't want to make a big deal about it.  LESSON LEARNED.  The cost of our meal including a drink and tip was well over $500.  The table service was outstanding hence we left a bigger tip.  However about  an hour after leaving the restaurant my husband was in the bathroom throwing up and on the toilet, that went on throughout the night, 30 minutes later my daughter was in the same condition.  She had shared the oysters with her dad.  They were miserable, and I called the restaurant back and could only leave a message.  the GM Chris called and I asked if they would credit 2 of the 3 meals.  They ended up sending me to their insurance company insinuating that I was going to sue them?!! All I asked for was they refund my husband and daughters meal they were sick I was fine.  Instead after 2 weeks going back and forth they finally wanted to send me $100 in meal credit to go back.  I felt insulted and told them they can keep their vouched as I will NEVER visit their establishment again.",

I gave my opinion, but my mom's friend was ready to eat and just wanted to eat there.  One of the ordered the pork chop, my mom and her other friend both ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the rib eye.  My mom's friend was having a very difficult time cutting her pork chop with the knife she was provided, so our waiter brought her a new one, but she still had a hard time. I thought that my rib eye was okay, but I definitely felt that I've had better. My mom said her filet was okay. I also had the wedge salad which was okay. There was something weird in it that did not taste good and I thought it was a piece of cheese at first, but the taste was so nasty it ruined the rest of the salad for me.  I kind of wish that we had gone to one of the places that I had recommended, but it was okay. I don't really think that I will go back, and if I do, I will not get the wedge salad :(",

At first I didn't want to go in the restaurant cause I thought it would be a strict dress code but as I looked around it was casual dress, so I went in a sundress.  Our waiter was named John.  He was awesome.  He took good care of us at our table. I had the filet mignon with the four cheese macaroni.  It was AMAZING.  Our experience there was an amazing one and would definitely visit again on our next trip back to Las Vegas.",

The restaurant was busy so I expected it to be kinda slow, so I ordered a few glasses of wine. The waiter was not even coming up to our table. The bus boy actually asked if we needed any refills or anything ordered.  The waiter seemed to know the parties at the tables around ours. Our food was cold and when I mentioned that,  I got the response \"Well, its busy tonight ma'am..\" I didn't drop $400 to get cold food but I was told management wasn't there and to come back again to contest my meal.  Never again will I waste my time or my money on this establishment.",

    "text": "Of all the years I've stayed at NYNY, I never stepped foot in Gallagher's and I extremely regret not discovering this wonderful gem.  I was always intimidated by the fact that it was a steakhouse and probably enforced a dresscode of some kind. But it doesn't, thank goodness. I also relied on this yelp page to make my food decisions, but now I think I shouldn't put so much faith on some of the information (LoL). Anywho, I think this is one of the best restaurants ever for casual dining at NYNY (DO NOT GO TO CHIN CHIN, YUCK!)  For all those who think there's no \"take-out,\" THERE'S TAKE-OUT(~30 minute wait)!!! Yea, I could've eaten at the actual restaurant, for dinner, around 9pm, during the Electric Daisy Carnival weekend, and pay a lot of tips.... but I chose to do take-out to the comfort of my hotel room-Player's suite and the best move of my trip =]  (Order take-out at the bar, bartender was great!)  Ordered lamb chops done medium-well (my mom can't take pink Lol), 2 clam chowders, a mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese with pork belly, a bread basket to go. It was around $80 and it was the best $80 spent. Lamb chops were extremely tender and juicy and well cooked and came in 3, clam chowder was slightly salty but full of clams, mashed potatoes were nothing spectacular, and mac n cheese were creamy and cheesy. =]   Till now, I still can't stop thinking about those lamb chops... I want some NOW! =[  Anywho, 5 stars for the meat, 3 for the sides, bread and butter is cool 4 stars LoL... I will be coming back for you Gallagher's! I will be coming back....",

    "text": "First of all - despite this place having a dress code of casual - I firmly believe that if you dress better, you'll get treated better. My bf (at the time) was wearing a suit and I was wearing this fantastic little black dress.  Secondly - any nice place that allows reservations - make them prior to your trip - you get much better seating.   So, when my bf (at the time) and I were planning to take a trip to vegas - he recommended this restaurant. I noticed that they were on Open Table - so I made those reservations a few weeks in advance.   We also planned to see Zumanity at the NYNY as well - to save on the travel time.   So we arrive right on time - despite the use of cab/monorail/walking. Perfect. We get seated in the back area where it's considerably quieter than nearer the casino area.   Prior to arriving here, we had some fresh oysters at the Oyster Bar at Harrah's -  a little \"hidden\" gem amongst the smoke filled casino.  So when seated - we check out the menu. I decide to eat the center cut Filet Mignon and a side of 4 cheese Mac & cheese, and I believe my bf decided on the NY steak. Both were aged and tender tender tender.The bread was crusty and just delicious.   The service here was perfect. Waiter was very helpful and extremely patient. He checked on us very few times - and only helped us when needed. It irks me when waiters check every 15 minutes - leave me alone.   Sure, the steaks here are pricy - but considering the aging process - it's well worth it. It's vegas - and good eats are all around.   When we return to Vegas - we are going to return to Gallagers. Yum Yum Yum.",

    "text": "DELICIOUS!!!  The ONLY reason I'm not giving this place a full 5 stars is because our appetizer, the Sea Scallops, only came with 3 for $18- and they were not really \"jumbo\" sized, and the third was was actually pretty small. For the price I wish it was at least 4 scallops, but if you're gonna only give 3, then at least make them all big. However, despite that they were YUMMY. Pureed grits (delish) with bacon wrapped scallops and a red pepper sauce-- gooood.   My husband and I split the cowboy ribeye, which was HUGE. We were both full off this easily. I cannot imagine how anyone could eat this by themselves without having a lot of leftovers. We didn't have a fridge in our motel room, so that wasn't an option-- but we cleaned our plates and left feeling full but not miserably so. The steak was so tender and flavorful- it did have some fatty pieces as ribeyes are known to do, but I gave those mainly to my husband to eat. I tried a piece and it melted in my mouth, but in general I usually don't like the fat. The crispy onions on top were fantastic as well as the small side of greens that came on the plate. We got our with horseradish and it really sent the meat over the edge. The creamed spinach side we got was definitely big enough for two people and was YUMMY!!  Our server was extremely nice and explained everything we needed to know. The service was relatively fast and we were able to get in at 7pm on a saturday (memorial day weekend) without a reservation! But pretty sure we just got lucky because the place was definitely busy!  Soo good! And our bill was about $70, pretty great for the amount and quality of the food for 2 people!",

This is by far the best steak restaurant in Vegas because of the service, the wait time, the flavor, and the accuracy of our order. Everything we ate was absolutely amazing! We had appetizers,  brussel sprouts, green beans, mac and cheese, lamb chops, filet mignon, ribeye, key lime pie, chocolate cake,  you name it. We had it! Everything was amazing! Our waitress had perfect timing with everything. She never interrupted our conversation. She came at the perfect time with beverages. Our bill was about $100 each + tip. I would pay twice that compared to what we paid at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant the following evening. His restaurant was horrible! Gordon Ramsay's restaurant \"Steak\" , in Paris hotel , was the complete opposite of this restaurant. Great job Gallagher's! I will be back and I tell all my friends about you. Can't wait to see you again.",

But man, I really didn't care for the steak.   I had the Signature Aged New York Sirloin. It was not cooked properly. I asked for medium rare and got something that should have \"Moo-ed\" on my plate, it was really rare. The steak lacked flavor.  I expected a bit more char flavor, but all you could really taste was a mild herb.   Dessert was a bit disappointing.   Their Chocolate Volcano cake was nothing when compared to Ruth Chris's.  When you're in Las Vegas and you want steak, I'd recommend Lawry's or Blackwood's.",

    "text": "I came here for my bestfriend's birthday celebration and it was the best steak we both ever had. As soon as we stepped into the restaurant, we gave the hostess our name and got seated right away.   The first thing they served was the complimentary bread. The cranberry bread was bomb. My roommate and I didn't want to stuff ourselves with bread before the main dish comes out, so we didn't have much. As for appetizer, we got the portobello stuffed mushroom and caprese salad. I'm love mushrooms in general, so it was amazing for me. The portobello stuffed mushroom was really big considering that it was an appetizer. I want to say it's the size of a palm of a hand. The caprese salad was really good and different than other caprese I have tried at other restaurant. The caprese was extra soft and fluffy.  As for our main dish, I got the filet mignon and my roommate got the $60 porterhouse (since it was her birthday). We both wanted our steak to be cooked medium rare, but when the food came out, I wanted to say it was a little more on the rare side. We didn't mind so it was okay. As for my filet mignon, it was perfect! I thought the size was pretty small (in the..circumference terms?) but it was super fat and tall..if that makes sense. My roommate's porterhouse was crazy!..in a good way. She enjoyed it so much. But I wouldn't recommend for a girl/woman to order it unless she has a big appetite. It was bigger than an average woman's hand. My roommate couldn't finish it but she said her's was very juicy and fun to it.  So for our steaks, sides weren't included so we had to order separately. Each side ranges from $7-10 if I can remember. We got the cooked asparagus and creamed spinach. The asparagus only comes with 5 pieces, but they are huge and fat. As for the creamed spinach, it was enough portion for the two of us. I just thought it was a little too creamy for me.  The service at this restaurant was great! Our server was super duper nice. My roommate and I were actually going to order more, but our server was nice enough to save my wallet and stop us. The food came out really fast, so that's a plus.   We didn't get any dessert because both of us were way too full, but I did see the table next to me had some key lime pie. So maybe I'll try that next time. This restaurant is definitely on the pricey side, but I do give it a five star because the food was worth every penny. I would definitely come back and bring my parents or other friends.",

    "text": "Gallagher Steakhouse is located within the bowels of New York, New York casino. This restaurant features dry aged beef and their legendary Gallagher hospitality. Their signature 2 inch, bone-in top sirloin steak that has been dry aged for 30 days is one of the restaurant's top sellers. It should be noted that Gallaghers was once privately owned in New York until it became a franchise. Reservations are encouraged, especially if you plan to dine at around 7pm to 8pm. A dinner evening spent in this restaurant can cost you a minimum of $200 for two people.   Overview: I have visited at this restaurant a couple of times in the past several months and I was not overly impressed by the experience. The service was good, but the restaurant relied too heavily on its name to generate business. However, in fairness, it is still an above average steakhouse. Just a side note. If you do not know how to distinguish or cannot taste the difference between a 30 day dry aged beef and a regular cut of beef, then save your money and go to some other steakhouse like Outback. It will be cheaper for you and you'll won't be disappointed.   PROS: The restaurant offers dry aged beef, quality service, and can be easily found in the casino. The food is plentiful and an entree can be easily shared between two people.   CONS: The restaurant is really close to the casino floor so the dining atmosphere is somewhat disrupted with the gambling action outside. Additionally, this steakhouse does not have a restroom of its own. You will need to exit the restaurant and use the casino restroom nearby.   Restaurant Class: Upper-Middle   Food: (3.5 out of 5 stars) The steaks are well prepared and cooked to order. Additionally, a couple of their steak entrees are large enough to be shared by two people. More importantly, the dry aged steaks do not disappoint, especially if you are a steak connoisseur. The sides and soups are somewhat a different matter. The sides are nondescript and the soups tend to run on the salty side.   Atmosphere: (3 out of 5 stars) The ambiance and the genre falls in line with the Gallagher's theme in New York. It is lively and professional. However, that atmosphere tends to be ruined by the gaming action just outside the restaurant. And unless you are seated in a secluded and private room of the restaurant, you will not feel like you are in a premium New York steakhouse.   Cleanliness: (3.5 out of 5 stars) The staff does a good job in keeping the tables and the dining area clean. However, because Vegas allows patrons to smoke in casinos, there is a very faint smell of cigarette smoke in the linens.   Service: (4 out of 5 stars) The staff is professional and attentive. However, if you dining with a large party (6 people or more), the service level may diminish a bit; especially if you happen to be dining during a peak hour. Overall, there service level is consistent with the Gallagher's name.   Restroom Facilities: (3 out of 5 stars) The restaurant does not have a restroom of its own. If you do need to use the facilities, you will need to exit the restaurant and use the casino's restrooms. Other than that, the casino usually does a good job of keeping the facilities clean and well stocked.",

I made reservations (highly recommended) and we got there about 10 minutes early.  When we got to the hostess stand to check in, the hostess saw me and didn't even acknowledge me, the girl standing next to her said hi to us and kept looking at the hostess but she was acting like she was busy. She looked like she hated her job and seriously if you're gonna look and act like that to your customers, then get a new job.  After a few minutes the other girl asked us if we had reservations and that's when the hostess looked as us and finally helped us but was being really rude.  We finally got seated, our server was really nice and helpful.  The food was alright, nothing special, I've tasted better.   I got the lobster surf and turf and it was $125, my boyfriend got the prime rib and that was only $45. We also got sides to share and that was alright too.  Overall I don't think I would be coming back here.",

    "text": "I ate at Gallagher's years ago, well before I started yelping.  So, I hadn't been able to write a decent review since it had been so long.  We had some friends in town over the Memorial Day weekend, and hit up Gallagher's Thursday night.  Very, very glad we did.  The table shared many appetizers, and in my estimation, the Maryland crab cakes, blackened shrimp and blackened scallops were the winners.  And, for $18 you got a very good size portion, 4 of each.  I would say the amount of food in the appetizers was atypical for a steakhouse.  The sear on the cakes was textbook, and the sauce was excellent.  Same with the scallops.  The shrimp were very large, perfectly cooked.  They are served over cheesy grits, but not too much.  Just enough that you can get bites of shrimp and grits together.  The blackening is fantastic, I think they should expand this and make it a full entree.  Very good shrimp.  To eat, I had the bone in ribeye, which comes with a load of fried onions.  This was a fantastic steak, the dry aging is really noticeable.  The depth of flavor is much greater than in other steaks.  A member of our party had the pork chop, which I thought was solid but dry.  The 4 cheese macaroni was a big hit.  The sauce is not too thick, but had excellent cheesy flavor.  The onion rings were very crunchy, but a serving only has 4 large ones as I recall.  Difficult to share, we had to cut a couple in half.  This would have been nice to know when ordering, we probably would have ordered a second helping to make sure everyone got a full ring.  The wine list was good, I would say average for a strip steakhouse.  Service was fantastic.  Very friendly and not overbearing.   Will definitely return.",

I also has the scallops which were perfectly cooked.  The only hitch was the scallops came out 25 minutes after the salad. I had to ask the waiter if he had put the order in.  Overall a good place to dine.",

    "text": "We chose Gallagher's a for our anniversary dinner spot. Reservations were made easily through yelp and open table. We were seated immediately and once we were inside it was hard to imagine that we were in a loud casino.   Service was wonderful, old school steakhouse feel. Sam, our server, was attentive, helpful and a fun addition to the meal.  The food was great. As an appetizer we started with the shrimp and grits...yummy!We both ordered the filet mignon, the onion rings, and the mushroom medley. Everything was al a carte but just the right amount of food. We both left satisfied, not overly stuffed.   The in house photographer was a strange but fun added bonus. She actually took really nice pictures of us. The only part I didn't like was the fact that she brought them back to us as actual prints. It would make more sense to have them on an iPad or tablet and then print the ones people want. It seemed wasteful and weird to think about where the prints go if we don't buy them. We bought one and the lady who took the pictures was really nice and not pushy about trying to get us to buy them.",

We had a reservation on a Saturday night, and were seated quickly. The menu is all ala carte. I had the Prime Rib, potatoes, and asparagus. I ordered my prime rib medium well, and it came out very well done (no pink whatsoever). My friend ordered his Prime Rib medium and it was rare (bloody). You'd think for a $38 steak they could get it right. I will say the cuts were nice and think (14oz), but the flavor wasn't anything I haven't already tasted at most steak houses. The asparagus and yukon gold mashed however, were very very tasty.  Another person in our party got the surf and turf and the filet was very small. There was also a hair in their side order of mushrooms (we were given free creme brulee for this). It was an okay experience, but for the price ($500 for dinner for 6 people without alcohol), I'd expect near perfection.",

And I had a rib eye, I wasn't totally impressed because as one of the other reviewers said \"it tasted like a home grilled steak\" but a very good grilled steak though.  their wine list is decently sized and the wines by the glass were outstanding  I will come back next time we are in Vegas",

    "text": "I hate to give this place a 3 when the service was GREAT and the food was excellent, so why the 3? The hostess and the manager. Why had reservations for 11 people and 1 got sick so we told the hostess that 1 was sick so there would only be 10. One problem, she miss understood and thought that we said that there would only be 6. So we go back to our table and guess what it's a 6 top. No problem they said wait here and we will reset the 10 top. This is when all goes wrong. The hostess come back and starts BITCHING at us that we have to go back up front and can not wait where we are as it is pressuring her staff. Now we are far enough back that if we did this the table would be done and we would turn right back around and come back. With us is my 72 year old father who has trouble walking so we are not going anywhere. The hostess proceeds to keep bitching at us in a voice that is getting loader and loader to the point that her own staff is turning backs to her because they are embarrased by her behavior. I find the manager and mention to him what the hostess did, his response, well she is a valued employee who has been with us for a long time. Wrong response. That one line cost them almost $4000.00. How? We do a dinner in Vegas twice a year for 40 customers and the average bill is $4000.00 we have been looking at switching off restaurants and the food and service were good enough that we would have moved our August party to Gallagher's, but not now. Great Food, Great Service. Just avoid the blond hostess at all costs",

If you have the aged steak then have some later one, you will be able to taste the difference in the flavor and texture of the meat. However, I thought my partner's Filet Mignon was tastier. We also got a side of mash, which was alright. I was surprised that the Cesar Salad didn't have anchovies or the option. Overall, the food was tasty. The server was okay. He seemed a little mocking when I would let my partner choose the steak and wine (I just started eating steak). So in that respect, I felt it was lacking.",

Originally we were going to have dinner at one of the expensive French places inside the MGM but I was like what the heck when's the last time I had me a good piece of steak?? Plus my friends I was with only allowed me to choose that place because it was my birthday they weren't so excited about French food. Well this was the best decision I could of made that day. My fillet mignon was amazing even though it was well done. I know I know, wtf that's an insult to that meat but I like my steak well done sorry. The sides were good as well and the bottle of moscato we had was also very good. The dessert, WOW. Service was on point also and I enjoyed having my picture taken on my birthday so I can have a reminder of my 25th. I will most certainly go back whenever I'm in Vegas again. Oh and fyi: I did try my besties dinner she had her fillet mignon medium and it was also delicious. If I thought my well done was amazing, hers was perfect.",

I went on line and made reservations and requested a table for six near the kitchen so we could see the grill. Much to our surprise we were set up at the Chef's table. The Chef visited our table and provide great suggestions which turned out to be fantastic. The steaks are by far the best we have enjoyed anywhere in Las Vegas. This may not be for everyone but we love the action and the experience of a working kitchen. The food being prepared and the aromas are so great. I highly recommend a night out and great food and service at Gallagher's.",

And for the main course we both ordered the aged NY steak and they were so juicy with a nice smokey taste. We also ordered a side of their sauteed green beans. THIS IS A MUST! The green beans will suprise you. I'm not sure what they sauteed them with, but it was just SO GOOD. They were a perfect compliment to the steak. For dessert, we got the lemoncello flute which was basically a lemon sorbet, but so much better! It was very refreashing.   Overall, it was a great night out and I think it's well worth the money.",

    "text": "I told my girlfriend that all I wanted for my birthday was a steak dinner and she booked us a reservation at Gallagher's at NY NY in Vegas. We walked in and the table was ready right away and it has the complete feel of a traditional steak-house and one that would be home in downtown Manhattan (or so I imagine what that would look like). We started with oysters and crab salad. The oysters were good but the crab was incredible. Very fresh and lots of meat. I would get the crab salad again any day of the week.  I had ordered a filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked a little on the medium side but it still had it's rare-ish quality that made it juicy. My girlfriend, who is not a big steak eater, ordered the house steak with hollandaise sauce. Normally, I'm weary of steak places that offer sauce on their steak. call me old-fashioned, but I was raised in the school of a good steak doesn't need anything added to it. Save for a little garlic butter, but other than that, grill it and give it to me as is. However, as she ordered it medium-well, having the sauce there was a good option. The steak was still delicious and, more importantly, she loved it.  Lastly, an odd encounter happened there that made our trip funny as hell. So we were sitting next to each other and a group of older gentlemen sat next to us. On their way out, they slipped us a note saying that we were a cute couple and to save room for dessert and to try the \"sticky toffee pudding\". But the way they phrased the note, left room for multiple interpretations. So we called the waiter over, explained what happened and he laughed and gave us his opinion as to what he thought the note meant. He apologized for the enounter, and we assured him it wasn't a big deal at all, we just thought it was funny. He said it would have made more sense if they had actually bought us a dessert, but they didn't, so he had no clue what they were talking about. HOWEVER, when dinner was done, the waiter came over with the sticky toffee pudding and gave it to us on the house as a means of apologizing for his other table. It was completely unneccessary, but amazing customer service. The food gets 4 stars, the dessert was INCREDIBLE and gets 5 stars, but the service there gets 10 stars. I work in sales and appreciate good customer service and attention to detail and was VERY impressed with these guys. I wish I remember the name of our server...i think it was Raul...or Ramon...but he single-handedly made a good dinner, an exceptional evening. GIVE THAT MAN A RAISE!",

    "text": "Went here for dinner one night and booked a reservation online----moments before heading over there which was smart because the gentlemen who walked up to the hostess before us were told there was an hour wait.  We were seated promtply and had the crabcakes for an appetizer, a great choice, excellent crab cakes!  I guess I was in a crab kick because I ended up ordering the king crab legs for dinner, one of my dinnermates had the prime rib and another had a steak but I don't recall which one.  The king crab legs were good but they had an unusual flavor to them, as though they were boiled in a flavored water, they were still good, just different.  Both of my dining companions thought their meals were good, nothing was \"exceptional\".  We had the mac & cheese and broccoli for sides, the mac & cheese was ok but not amazing.  We did order the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, after living in England for several years if I ever see it on a menu I get it.  It was ok, far from what you'd get in the UK, but still ok.  Oh, the beer choices were pathetic.  I realize that I tend to go for more unique microbrews and there was nothing like that on the menu and for some reason I wasn't in the mood for wine.  Overall it was good, the prices were pretty high---$70 for king crab and it's not a place I'd need to visit again on my next visit to Vegas.",

We ordered cocktails and brushcetta for an app, a bread basket was brought out right away. For my main course I ordered the fillet, my bf ordered the rib-eye. We shared the colossal baked potato.  Both dishes seemed a bit on the cool side and were just so-so. The meat was cooked accordingly but just lacked the gusto of other steakhouses that we really enjoy (our fav steak joints are currently Ruth Chris and 5th & Wine).  Overall just not too impressed by the quality and temperature of our meal. On the plus side, our server was perfect. Another highlight was the dessert menu that lit up...however no dessert was ordered; for fear it would fall flat too.",

    "text": "Came here with a small group of coworkers during CES one evening.  I\"m not a big fan of family style sides but that's what you get here.  You each order your own entree such as a steak which comes with nothing else so you all have to decide which sides you are going to share.   I had a NY Strip which was pretty good.....not worth what they charged for it.....for that much I'd expect the best damn steak I ever had......but nope, just pretty good.  It was tender but not very flavorful. Personally, I do a better steak on my grill at home. The various sides we shared we all very good but with 5 of us you didn't get much of each since everyone wanted to try each one.  I could have eaten the mashed potatoes all by myself but had to settle for a spoonful or two. The service was decent.  Not very personal but attentive enough even with a good size crowd in there.  They have a decent selection of wine and absolutely loved the Moscato.   So overall impression, worth checking out if you can afford it or it's on someone else's dime, but so many other choices around where you can get a better meal for much less that I'm in no hurry to go back.",

This review is not for the main restaurant per se, but the service in the private room in the back.  We were served a four-course meal, and my fiance and I enjoyed 4-5 drinks each. The portions were absolutely perfect, and no one was left feeling bloated, and very little was left over. The hot and cold seafood appetizers were a particular favorite. I would eat here every day if I could.  The service was as close to perfect as I've ever seen. Dishes appeared and were whisked away very promptly, often without anyone noticing. The wait staff responded promptly to requests, even in the middle of a course service. They all had a smile and seemed thrilled to take care of our group.  The bar service was shockingly wonderful. The bloody mary was so good we returned the next day for another round. The wait staff was able to give very good suggestions to those members of our group who weren't sure what to order. In fact, when I ordered a mojito and no mint was on hand, the staff actually sent someone to the store to get some, and my drink was served with no noticeable delay (the drink was perfect, by the way.)  If I could give six or seven stars to Gallagher's, I would. Perfect all experience all around.",

We didn't have to wait for our table but did have to ask the hostess to move us to a larger table (my husband is 6'7) obviously the average 2 top doesn't cut it!! The waitress was a very kind lady from Hawaii and the clam chowder was awesome but unfortunately that's where the pluses ended. Both steaks were dry and next to flavorless and the asparagus side dish was underwhelming. The decor was blah and I feel that we were over dressed :/ (I like to dress up for nice dinners).The drinks were strong, the calamari was decent but that was about it. As far as price is concerned I don't feel it was overly expensive. $43 is about average for a steak on the strip, I'm not sure what else would be expected. We are locals and won't be back and this place won't be recommended. We like the kind of steaks that don't need A1!! lol",

My husband and I each had a cowboy ribeye along with mac and cheese, green beans, and a baked potato.  Best part of the meal was the green beans.  The steaks weren't that tender and the mac and cheese was bland and soupy.  This was our fist time eating at a nice steakhouse.  So I'm wondering if steakhouses are overrated, or if it's just this place.  Either way we will probably stick to having steaks at home.  Oh and if you are planning to see Zumanity afterwards, they don't allow food in the theatre so think about that if you are planning to take home any leftovers.  The atmosphere, service and drinks were good.  The food was average.",

The portions were big enough for my friend and I to split. I love how they place the roasted garlic on there as well, it adds so much more flavor.   Right next to us, a couple ordered the lobster and I don't even know how to describe this thing. First of all, it was huge. Secondly, they made this lobster into some sort of masterpiece. The presentation of it was just unbelievable. I would want to try that but by the looks of it, I would probably be broke afterwards.   This place is no joke, do not come here if you're on a budget. You are seriously going to burn a hole in your pocket. But if you do come here, get their prime rib, it's what they're known for.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying that I haven't been to Vegas in many many many years.  When we were there this past week, we ate at quite a few big name restaurants on our visit but was craving a great steakhouse.  I asked a friend to suggest a great steak while we were still in town so here is my two cents.  The ambiance was loud and alive, reminiscent of a traditional Chicago steakhouse, minus the sound of the casino.  When I ordered wine for our table of 6, our server (Caroline), was very suggestive about wine pairing with each course as we progressed through our meal, which I really enjoy and find a great part of the culinary expirience.  Our server was also great at answering all questions that my guests had regarding portions, ingredients and even answered questions regarding my wife's allergies.  She was pleasant and well informed.  Top notch!    For starters, the group started out with the crab cakes and calamari, which were very good, as were the wedge salad and roasted baby beet salad.  A couple of us had the clam chowder and said it was rustic and hearty in style.  Many of us ordered the bone-in dry aged NY steak that she suggested and everyone at the table commented how cooked perfectly there steaks were cooked considering almost everyone ordered them cooked differently, we are a nightmare in restaurants! Other's had the Colorado lamb and commented how nice it was that it was not New Zealand lamb which tends to be a bit gamey and alot smaller chops.  My wife had the Irish organic salmon and loved it, as her allergies were looked after.  Thank you. We tried many of the side dishes and they were all very good as well.  All in all it was a very fun evening, the food and service were great! We don't have a Gallagher's here in Denver, so I'm thinking we have to hop over to Vegas more often!",

My husband had the Porter House Steak and let me tell you it was huge and so juicy and flavorful! Dinner was Yummy! Our waiter was so nice too and very attentive. We did not feel rushed and we ordered some drinks and enjoyed it. Gallagher's is a Steakhouse were you can have drinks and have classy romantic dinner with your better half or a fun dinner with your friends. I recommend that when in Vegas try New things and classy things as well. Thank you Gallagher's we had a Fabulous Time! We will be back!",

    "text": "My husband and I always wondered about this restaurant seeing the aged steaks hanging in the window so we decided to give it a try and were not disappointed.  We both had the bone in rib eyes medium rare and both were delicious.  Cooked to perfection and juicy.  Although we ordered sauces the steaks did not need them at all.  I ordered the whiskey mushroom sauce and he ordered the Stilton blue cheese sauce.  Both were delicious and came in their own boats separately.  We started with Caesar salads both of which were beautifully dressed.  I had a jumbo baked potato and he had a Yukon gold mashed puree.  We also had the sauteed mushrooms.  All we piping hot and delicious.  We each had wine; I had a glass of wonderful Cabernet and he had a delicious glass of Merlot.  We topped off dinner by sharing a fabulous creme brulee.  The service was impeccable and the food fantastic.  I love the old house supper club feel of the steak house!  I can now say I've had thee best steak ever.  Will definitely go back again!",

    "text": "I've been to a handful of high end steakhouses and this is probably one of the best, if not, the best steak I've ever had. The atmosphere is semi-loud, decorated as if you were in the heart of mid-town, NY with various vintage pictures of people and the city. Their steaks are all aged for about 3 weeks in their temp/humidity controlled meat locker which is quite the sight when you first walk up to the restaurant. Service was perfect from the hostess to our nicely dressed and professionally-mannered server. I ordered the rib-eye and the wife ordered the New York strip. The steaks came out much larger than I expected so definitely save your stomach when coming. They come bone-in and a la-carte, which seems typical of many steakhouses. Mine had a nice, blackened outer crust and nice, perfectly cooked, tender pink inside. We also got the roasted vegetables as a shared side, which was perfect in conjunction with the pounds of meat in front of us. Although we wanted to, we just didn't have room for anything else after our dinner for dessert. Like many good steakhouses, Gallagher's knows steak and they do it right. It just seems like for the price, these guys do it a tad bit better than some others I've been to. We will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas.",

We had heard from our foodie friends Cynthia A. and Jo C. about Gallagher's and opted to look into their suggestion. Now, Cynthia A. knows her foodie chops and I trust her implicitly so when she told me to go there, I WENT THERE.  Definitely not disappointing! Mr. J and I (of course) ordered the rib eye for our main dishes with sides of the truffle mashed potatoes and a cup of the famous clam chowder for an appetizer. All were incredibly delicious and we gobbled them all up. I was so sad that I had no room for the highly-recommended bread pudding. No, literally, I had NO room left in my constricting dress so we had to go back and I had to change clothes to accommodate my now expanded girth.   So far, my favorite steakhouse anywhere. Extremely great value for the quality. Worth the experience and will come back for sure.",

The place initially looks small, with a bar up front, but there is a lot of seating at the back. The servers are all super friendly and helpful. We had an Old Fashion each which was SO strong, but obviously great! We ordered the dry agednew York strip and the rib eye, both medium rare, although the strip steak was more rare than medium rare, both steaks very thick cut. The creamed spinach and caramelized onion mash potato was ok. We loved the sticky toffee pudding. Overall we enjoyed the food, but we've had better steaks elsewhere. Based on food we'd give it a 3, but the service was great so we give it a 4. Only complaint would be it did take them a long time to bring out drinks and food, but regardless we did enjoy our meal.",

The bartenders and servers were all very good and professional.  They got me my beer and menu quickly and had my place set and took my order. I started with a wedge salad and that was very good.   I generally order a steak on the bone when in a good steakhouse and was leaning towards the bone in rib steak but opted for the bone in NY strip based on the two guys sitting next to me. I ordered my steak medium rare and added a side of potato puree.  My food was delivered promptly after I finished my salad and it was good but not anything special. The steak was cooked properly but it was a little tougher than it should have been since it was supposed to be aged prime beef.   I didn't order dessert and my check with tip came to $110 for a salad, steak, side and three beers.  I enjoyed my dinner here but there are definitely better steakhouses I've eaten at in Vegas",

    "text": "Hello and welcome to Gallagher's steak house. We were attending a concert at the new arena adjacent to NYNY so we decided to have a nice meal first. Sort of a late anniversary dinner for Josie and I. We had 515pm reservations and arrived early and were seated within minutes of arrival. The host was quite friendly and evoked a great starting conversation setting the mood for our dinner. Bryan was our waiter and had a great knowledge of the menu and specials. I know you are wondering (did drink service come quick?) it did. We had waters in just a few moments and our drink order was taken. We also ordered our appetizer of seared Ahi Tuna.Seasoned quite well with a creole type seasoning and braised just perfectly. It came with some melon slices and other seasonal fruits. We also then ordered a salad round. I had the house wedge with blue cheese Josie had the beet salad. The wedge reminded me of my first ever wedge at a place in Henderson Nevada, Nick's Supper Club. (NOSTALGIA). Perfect amount of the Blue Cheese dressing with small tomatoes and a couple croutons. Josie said the beet salad was perfectly dressed and had great flavor.our main course, their aged bone in New York Steak, was a perfect medium rare with no outside seasoning just the grilled natural flavor that awoke the carnivore inside me. We shared the steak so we could enjoy a full meal without left overs and feeling over stuffed. Our sides were Mac-n-Cheese and creamed spinach. Neither were overwhelming in taste. They did have good seasoning and flavor. We did not have time or room for desert but want to go back because the menu looked really inviting. Thank you for eating at Gallagher's Steakhouse. We will likely go back and try a few items we saw that looked really good. The staff was hard working and friendly. Our waiter stated that it was a busier night than normal for a Friday, and the staff was handling it quite professionally. If you get the chance to go to NYNY please check this great place out. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "I've come to realize that Vegas can be anything you want it to be.  If you want the Hangover type experience, you can certainly pursue it.  There are plenty of venues to satisfy the raunchy-party side of you.  The night life in Vegas is just phenomenal.  Not too far off, if your disposition is in the spectrum of the more relaxing, affordable, family friendly experience, Vegas can accommodate you as well.  (Sadly) My recent trip to Vegas was closer to the latter.    While in Vegas, I definitely wanted to have a nice steak dinner but didn't want to pay a premium either.  There are plenty of steakhouses in Vegas associated with famous chefs and they are not cheap.  For some YELPERS they swear it's the best steak they ever had.  Believe me, I get it.  When it comes to steak and sushi, you follow the golden rule, don't skimp.  After all, which would you rather eat, steak at Denny's or Ruth's Chris?  You get my point.   No offense to Denny's btw.      So how do I square the relaxing-affordable side with wanting a great steak dinner?  Simple, hidden in New York New York hotel, you'll find a gem of a steakhouse named Gallagher's.  This steakhouse is both understated and refined and I'm happy to admit, they cook a damn good steak.  I had the dry aged rib-eye with sauteed spinach and for dessert - key lime pie.  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  I won't go into details of my dining experience except to say I was very impressed and the service was impeccable.    Yup, in Vegas there's a steakhouse for everyone but I'm glad I went to Gallagher's.  My wallet was glad too.",

Overall it seems like a safe bet for a very nice steak dinner but nothing really blew my mind. Adding in the tourist price gouging just kind of shifts the whole experience down a notch for me. It still wouldn't be my first choice but I wouldn't be kicking and screaming if I had to come back.   I ordered the cowboy rib eye and a wedge salad, and as a group we ordered a sampling of the sides, including the mashed potatoes, asparagus, mac and cheese, and the mushrooms. I liked the salad, it was a bit more dressed up than the usual wedge and was a nice start. My steak was cooked to a good medium rare and was also seasoned well. It was a giant steak but a good portion of it was inedible fat. All the sides were pretty good but the mac and cheese and the mushrooms were by far my favorites. They serve the sides family style (like most steakhouses) but they were much smaller than I was expecting.  I will say that our waiter was really on the ball: fast, efficient, and friendly, and all the other staff was really good as well. They are clearly very experienced with handling big groups such as ours.",

We were originally seated in a crazy weird section that looked like a converted part of the kitchen.  When we asked to be moved, they promptly moved us. Service and wait staff were great. We had 4 steaks. 3 were prepared great. 1 was a little too burnt on the outside (especially for medium well).  Salad was great, sides were good. It's a noisy atmosphere, but it's probably hard to get a quiet one in Vegas. Enjoyed it as a one time treat for me and the kiddos.",

The cowboy prime rib was ordered medium rear and it was perfectly cooked on the outside and pink all the way through with an all around great rub. The peppercorn sauce was a good compliment to go with it but you really don't need it.   The fresh catch of the day was the barramundi fish (sea bass) and it was perfectly seared on the outside with a good crust and tender white meat in the inside. It was flavorful and fulfilling.  This is a must go to.....at least once because once you try it, you will make it your staple whenever you come to Vegas.",

So everyone raves that the steak is a must to get, and I kept eyeing the menu for a long time and noticed there's a good section on different meats to eat. I ordered the Filet Mignon while my vendor ordered the Porterhouse. The Filet mignon was so tender and delicious, you just want to keep on eating this. The porterhouse was huge and we ate the steak like we were kings! The puree potatoes and asparagus were paired with the meats.  I must say the meal was by far amazing and the meal was prepared very deliciously.    As for the dessert, check out the MENU!!!! I was enlightened (literally) but the iPad lit up double screen of the different selections of cocktails and desserts!  The key lime pie and the new york cheesecake are definitely worth getting here.  Definitely coming back and they are pretty fast in getting the meal delivered promptly.",

The lunch menu is limited to 6-7 items.  Its great for me when menus are small and I don't have to really think.  I opted for the prime rib hoagie, which I believe is around $15.00.  It comes with chips and Au Ju sauce.  The sandwich is good, not great, but good enough for me to devour it quickly.  Considering this is a higher end place, the price was a pretty good deal and the portion was pretty large.  I also opted for a bloody mary.  The bartender handed me a menu and asked what I'd like in it.  Items range from bacon, slim jims, stuffed olives, and the rest of the standards.  Really good drink.  I believe the price is $8.00 for this meal in itself drink.  Next visit, I'm going back to my missed steak dinner.",

We had a couple of gift certificates that were about to expire so I ordered something I never would.  The King Cut Prime Rib!  What a MONSTER!!  A tremendous piece of bloody cow.  The couple at the table next to us had a look of horror when it was brought to the table.  It was even better than Lawry's.  Just go easy on the horseradish or you'll be making \"wasabi burning face\" in about 5 minutes like I did.  My wife got the filet mignon as usual and it was really meh.  Ruth's Chris serves a better filet than Gallagher's.  Sides were fine.  We got sauteed spinach which was nice and buttery along with the 4 cheese mac.  Service was fine.  I thought it was funny that the server really went out of his way to let us know off the bat that everything was a la carte.    And even though I gush about the prime rib, I never go to nice steakhouses to eat it.  You can do much better for an average price of $40 a steak elsewhere in town.  Craftsteak, Carnevino, Cut, Stripsteak, Del Frisco, Capital Grille and yes, possibly even Ruth's Chris would all be places I'd rather shell out my own dough to eat at than here.    But you know what I'm ordering if there is a next time!",

    "text": "I've gobbled up quite a few mouth-watering steaks in Vegas over the years, unfortunately this place didn't quite bring out the carnivorous T-Rex side in me. My dry-aged sirloin steak was cooked perfectly to my specifications, and was tender and juicy in every bite. It was nicely seasoned, and had a nice crust on the exterior. So what's the problem? Well, the steak seemed to taste awfully familiar to the steak grilled in my own backyard.  I'm no steak expert by any means, nor do I claim to be champion amateur steak griller, but if I'm going to shell out $40+ for a steak at a restaurant, I typically want it to taste exponentially BETTER than the steak I make at home. At home, I usually eat my steaks with A1 sauce. Here, well the thought had crossed my mind.  The \"4 cheese\" mac 'n cheese was an extreme disappointment. I could hardly taste one type of cheese, as it was bland and lacked any flavor. The pasta was overcooked, and overall the side was just lukewarm, mere minutes away from being a cold dish. Our calamari appetizer was average, and it just didn't have that pipin' hot freshness. Although the outside breading was decent, the calamari inside seemed a tad rubbery. My wife and I did like the marinara sauce, which was so good that we kept dipping our breads in it.  Service was less than desired. Everyone from the hostess to our waiter seemed to give an overall vibe of \"blah.\" The 20% off coupon from the hotel was the saving grace, but I'd rather pay full price at other places like Craftsteak, Joe's Stone Crab, and the Palm.   Or, I can always fire up the grill at home and bust out the A1.",

I ordered the special, which at the time was Mahi-mahi - I figured fish would cook faster than a steak or something like that. Best decision I have ever made. The waitress continued to check on our food and us to make sure we would be able to enjoy our meal and get to the show on time, and let me tell you - so worth the wait and the rush. BEST FISH I HAVE EVER HAD. It had some sort of maple glaze/sauce on it and it was simply to die for.  Everyone else was immensely satisfied with their meals too.

Usually I go to the same place but I was in the mood for something different... Anyways... I agree with a few of the other reviews - this is not prime it taste like USDA at best - the meat is tuff and not flavor full & once again the meat was not cooked correctly (2 steaks ordered the same and 1 cooked to order the other not) Bottom line.

You can easily cobble a veggie plate together, and our server was super helpful guiding me through my options. I had steamed asparagus, onion rings, mashed potatoes (yukon gold puree), a caprese salad, and the mushroom medley. They are large sides -- I finished about half. The potatoes and onion rings are particularly good. Vegans would struggle here, but if you're a vegetarian, flexitarian, or pescatarian, you'll have plenty of choices.  The drinks weren't all that impressive. They have a decent bar, but the night we were there (May 2013), their bartender had a heavy hand with mixers. The glasses are a little small and the glassware feels light. The wine we had with dinner was fine, but not all that remarkable. They clearly make their money from the steaks not the booze.  I was *very* impressed by the service. They were attentive, but never pushy. We didn't feel rushed or pressured. One server here sees my dad every time he's in town -- and has met my mom, my sister, and me over the years. She remembers him and always makes a point to check in with him when he comes in to eat. It's the level of personal service you'd get in a small-town -- something pretty remarkable in Vegas.  The decor is very masculine, with lots of dark wood, big booths, and dark green leather. Think British sporting club. It's nice, but not stuffy. It felt like a dressy steakhouse you'd find in Des Moines.  Sure, the beef here is the steaks -- but they have more going for them than mere meat.",

We originally booked a reservation here because it was around the corner from the Zumanity show that we had tickets for. The hostess we originally talked to was very polite and informative letting us know that a 9:30 pm booking was probably the best time since our show was for 7:30. At this point, we had high hopes for this place.   The day of our booking we called to confirm our reservation and the hostess hung up on my bf mid sentence saying, \"No we don't have a booking under that name.\" Confused, I called back, and they eventually found our name. I wanted to make sure I received the check since it was my bf's b-day weekend. She said \"Ok\" then hung up without asking me which of the 4 people under our reservation that I was.   Our server was ok...but obviously didn't get the message about the check. (Surprise Surprise) When we asked for our check she threw it down next to my bf. Of course if he sees the check he's going to try to pay for it!!! It was his birthday, this is what I was trying to avoid!",

My friend ordered the Filet Mignon and it was perfect.  I tried a couple bites and it was melty and mouth-watering.  I am a steak-lover and I absolutely approve both their NY Sirloin and Filet Mignon!!!  They also have a good selection of desserts.  If I had the room in my stomach, I would have.  Next time for sure.",

    "text": "Came to Gallagher's Steakhouse for dinner with my friends while I was here in Las Vegas.  Gallagher's Steakhouse is the high end steakhouse for New York New York Hotel.  The decor here has that feel of an upscale NY dinning establishment.  It's a nice high end feel but comes at a price of that they really pack you so that you're really close to your neighbors and that the acoustics of this Gallagher's is lousy so you have to really speak up in order to talk to the people across from you.  They had our reservations and was able to show us our seats within minutes of arriving.  The menu here is pretty basic and what you would expect from a steakhouse, appetizers such as crab cakes, shrimp or crab cocktails, and bruschetta ranging in the $8 -$12+ range and a range of steaks such as filet mignon, porterhouse, prime rib, and a couple of chops and seafood selection ranging in the $30 - $45.  Also, sides do not come with the meal, so for your veggies, potatoes, and macroni you're looking at spending an additional $6 - $10 each as well as they have 3 sauces to choose from at an additional $2 each.  I decided to get the filet mignon medium and my friends got the prime rib and we decided to share the mash potatoes and the broccoli au gratin.  My friend also got clam chowder which he thought was ok.  When we got our meal, I have to say portion size, I was impressed.  The \"queen\" size prime ribs were huge, my filet mignon was the size of my fist.  The mash potatoes was pretty small, just barely enough to give each of us 1 spoon full, and the broccoli was a decent size head covered in cheese.  Looking forward I cut into my meat and the first bite, over cooked.  It was closer to well done and maybe even a medium well, then a medium.  As I ate my meat, the cooking was so uneven.  I would say only about 15% of the filet mignon was cooked to a medium, the rest of it ranged everywhere from rare to well done.  It wasn't even like it was just the center that was rare, it was just unevenly cooked everywhere.  The only place that was consistant was that the outside was well done.  The pieces that were cooked to a medium was very good and very tender and you can tell the meat quality is there, just the cooking was almost criminal to waste a good piece of meat like that.  My friends also had the same problems.  One got his prime rib medium well, and it was cooked well done.  NO pink to the meat at all.  My other friend just liked the outside with the seasoning and didn't like the center.  They also didn't serve the horseradish or au jus sauce with the prime rib and I know you have to pay extra for the sauce (personally at these prices and paying ala carte, they should just give it to you) but not giving them the au jus to go with the prime rib is a major faux pas.  The sides we ordered were good, probably the small portion of mash potatoes was the best dish of the night.  Very creamy and looks like they put it through a blender to get out all the lumps.  The broccoli, well it was a nicely cooked piece of broccoli with some high end cheese melt on top, it was good, but nothing special.  The service here was friendly for the most part until one of my friends asked to take home his prime rib (he probably only ate about half his food) and it got into this long and weird awkward moment with one of the waiter's assistant asking if he was sure he wanted it wrapped and asked him several times until he finally got it wrapped.  The total bill came out to be about $175 including beers and tips.  Honestly, for that much money, I didn't walk away feeling impressed with Gallagher's Steakhouse.  For the prices you pay for, the cooking quality of the steaks should be much much better.  The ingredients are there, but if you have a guy who can't cook a piece of meat evenly, let alone to a medium, or even know that a medium well prime rib has some pink to it, you're just wasting your money Gallagher's Steakhouse.  High quality ingredients and portion size can only hide so much, you still need to be able to cook.  I would save your money and go else where, 2 stars for Gallagher's Steakhouse for their high quality ingredents and not much else.",

    "text": "I was really expecting high marks for Gallagher's after reading good reviews, but I came out feeling disappointed; not so much on the food but for the service. When we walked in, I already had a bad vibe from the hostess. The quality of customer service wasn't there compared to Mastro's or even Ruth's Steakhouse. Once again, we had a 20 percent coupon so decided to try this place out.  We started on with their calamari. It was tender and nicely breaded although it seems a little limped and not crispy enough. The marinara sauce was the star of the appetizer...I couldn't stop eating it even after all the calamari was gone, I dipped the complimentary bread with it. Then we had the baby spinach salad but to my surprise it had blue cheese on it which I am not a fan. On the menu, it didn't explain what it came with but ordered it anyways. The salad was decent, nothing spectacular..it was just a salad after all.  Hubby ordered the dry aged sirloin steak with the side of mac and cheese. I had some of his steak and it was pretty good but didn't taste a huge difference from that steak to a Mastro's steak. The mac n cheese was a True disappointment; it lacked season and flavor. It seems like they finished making the mac n cheese before the steak since the cheese was not smooth but coagulated.   Going back to the service, our waiter probably came to our table twice to check in and a couple times, it seemed he purposely passed our table to go the one next to us. We had better service from the bread and water person. My water was always filled without me asking for it.",

I may have gotten food poisoning from here, I'm not sure. The next day it started. It was either from here or from Mcdonalds Egg McMuffin the next morning, one of those two though put me out of commission for 36 hours.   I got broccoli, mac & cheese, and a dry aged sirloin. My wife got a tenderloin.  Portions wre great, big, but the steak was mediocre. My wife said my steaks are better, she was really disappointed. What do I do? Buy angus tenderloins at the grocery store, use McCormick's GrillMates Garlic, Herb, & Wine marinade with some added basalmic. Grill slowly until medium and crumble some fresh basil ribbons and parmigiana on top. Anyways...  you just expect expensive steaks at a steakhouse to be better than what you do at home, and well, they weren't.   Service was top notch, no problems there.   Overall I can sum up the place in two words \"Nothing Special\" and if it is nothing special, then you might as well eat somewhere cheaper.",

Well, Gallagher's serves such steaks and they are UNBELIEVABLE!     I always order the surf and turf.  I don't care how much it costs because I can never decide between their amazing steak and lobster.  I like to order my steak (fillet Mignon) butterflied medium at Gallagher's.  It always seems to come out just perfect that way.    Their side dishes are not the best, in my opinion which is too bad but their main entrees more than make up for their shortcomings.  They have pretty good salads, too.  I like the spinach salad with light dressing.    I would be in real trouble if Gallagher's was in my neighborhood.  5 stars",

Ordered Calamari as an appetizer, it was very good but waiter didn't bring the sauce we asked to go with it until after it was finished.  Had their Rib-Eye, which the server Derek recommended over the Sirloin. It was a thick-cut, easily 20oz, and looked amazing when it came out. I found mine to be slightly undercooked (med-rare over med) however, and more importantly devoid of seasoning which was addressed by some salt and pepper (though sea-salt pre-fire would have been ideal).  The meat was somewhat chewy/tough in spots (easily spotted without cutting into the steak), which I understand is common in certain cuts of meat but would have thought they would have selected better (never had a bad cut at Morton's or Ruth Kris, could always cut theirs with fork alone), but perhaps I just got \"unlucky\" with mine this time. Mashed potatoes were excellent.  I dont want to come off as the dinner was not good, it was good, but for this high-end of a steak-house, I expected better for the price being charged, granted my steak may have been a fluke.",

    "text": "3.5 stars based on my meal, not my co-diners'.  My queen cut prime rib, ordered medium rare, looked more rare under the lighting but was actually closer to medium.  The cut was so thick (or maybe it was due to a different reason) that it wasn't as tender or as melt-in-your-mouth flavorful as I like it.  I was kind of surprised, considering it's a top steakhouse.  I could barely eat half of it, which I was thankful for since I didn't overeat and wasn't in pain like everyone else.  Sides:  Sauteed mixed mushrooms (turned out to be just button mushrooms and cut up shiitake mushrooms in a wine sauce).  They were tasty, though the menu was kind of misleading that they would be a better variety of mushrooms.  Creamed spinach (really creamy, a little bitter for me, nothing special).  Four cheese macaroni and cheese (non-hollow penne-like pasta swimming in what reminded me of a thick cheese soup -- I liked the smoked gouda addition and the texture of the pasta, which was almost like gnocchi, though).  I didn't try the asparagus in hollandaise, which looked really fresh and perfectly cooked.  The chocolate-zin dessert port I had for my after-dinner drink was really delicious.  I had never seen that offered anywhere before.  So 3.5 stars for my meal.  But I tried my boyfriend's steak (the dry-aged NY sirloin specialty of the house), and the crust on that was so flavorful and fantastic.  Not 5 star fantastic, but really really good.  The porterhouse, who was ordered by a friend who'd tried it a couple of years ago and had been dreaming of it ever since, made said friend very happy and quiet.  This time it was served with some bone marrow and roasted garlic to spread on the steak.  And a friend who ordered the filet mignon said it was like butter.    I know my co-diners would give this place much higher ratings based on their meals, but I wouldn't go here for the prime rib.  Note: Interestingly, the last time I was in NYC, I came across the huge dry aging room that is viewable from the sidewalk at the original location.  I thought it was awesome, especially since people were working inside (the one at NY NY is much, much smaller).  Did you know it was America's first steak house (1927), created and named after a former Ziegfeld Follies dancer?",

Heck when you walk up to the reception area you are greeted by a huge meat locker filled with choice cuts of steak.   Those hunks of meat are just sitting there... tempting you to order one.   Beckoning toward you like a lighthouse on a storm tossed beach.  I had visions of me going in the meat locker to rescue the aging beef from it's long wait.   A nice grille and a pair of tongs would do the trick.     But after my wife stopped me from walking into the meat locker, we got a table and decided to eat like civilized people.     The steak itself was good.   It had the distinctive taste of being dry aged.   But it wasn't particularly tender nor flavorful.   The sides were ok, nothing to write home about.   Don't get me wrong, the meal was good, it just wasn't great.   The wines and drinks were a little expensive.   This place is a 3.5 star place, but the high price makes me round it down to 3 stars.     Will I be back?   Yeah, maybe.   If I want to spend about the same money for a better steak dinner, I will be going to CraftSteak at the MGM.",

My boyfriend and I made a reservation through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a>. Upon our arrival we were kindly greeted and escorted to our small table in the far back. The feel of the restaurant was semi- business casual/slightly romantic. Our waiter took about 15 minutes to come back with the wine menu. By the time he came back, we were ready to order our wine, appetizers, bread and meal.  Appetizer: The bread was very hard- may have been stale, but we were hungry. The butter did most of the job. Nothing too special. We also ordered 4 oysters $3.50/ea. Very small, but fresh and tasty. The oysters were accompanied w/ half a lemon and a teeny-tiny tabasco sauce bottle.   Entrees: Boyfriend ordered the dry aged New York Sirloin $40 (sides must be ordered separately). The steak was medium rare, just as he ordered it. It was perfect! Full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Did not need any type of sauce. I think it was one of the best pieces of steaks I've had, but boyfriend's had better. He ordered steamed broccoli ($8) and the colossal baked potatoe ($8). The broccoli was soft, tender and delicious. It didn't need salt, butter or anything. It dissolved in your mouth. According to boyfriend, the baked potatoe was nothing special. He could've gone without ordering it. Both sides were very large portions, each side is enough to fill at least two people. I, on the other hand, ordered the cesar salad ($8.95) as my main dish because I knew I would enjoy a piece of boyfriend's steak. The salad was fresh and good. It had shaved parmesan cheese and home made ceasar dressing (at least it tasted homemade).  I would definitely return to this place. We had excellent, attentive service and a great meal. We didn't think the meal was too expensive either. Our total bill was slightly over $100.  By the way, beware of the lady who comes around to take pictures. Some people get annoyed with her. She will take several pictures with your permission and sell each large photo jackets with two pictures for $45 (if I remember correctly) and $15 for the wallets. We bought them because they came out great. They're just too pricey.",

    "text": "My cousins and I wanted to originally go to Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse in Paris, but being that it was last minute and right before July 4th Holiday, we weren't able to squeeze in a reservation. While searching for other options, we also realized we didn't have the appropriate apparel packed for us to go to any other steakhouses... so we went on a hunt for a fairly casual place. My cousin found this place online and for whatever reason, we were convinced this place was a casual restaurant. I was thinking... outback-steakhouse casual. So without much thought or consideration we strolled in with shorts and my brother went in with a sleeveless shirt and felt so awkward being seated. This may not be your super upscale restaurant where they won't seat you unless in proper attire, but \"casual\" is not the average \"casual\" attire you would think. I guess I forgot, we were in vegas and the average person is dolled up regardless of occasion! Regardless, we were seated and service was amazing. The waiters knew the menu inside and out and without hesitance knew what to recommend for those who were first timers.  The food itself was amazing as well. I'm not a professional when it comes to steakhouses by all means but from what I have tried, the dry aged steak was pretty amazing. I also had the spinach salad as well as the sauteed french green beans and both were impressive. Portions were HUGE and all of us were SO FULL trying to each finish the dry aged steak. I would say men would be able to finish the steak but women should think to share no matter how hungry they may be--and most especially if you are thinking to order sides.  All in all, I would give the steakhouse a 4 because I can't necessarily say that this was the BEST steak I have ever had and the BEST restaurant experience. The ambiance, the food, the service were all great... but nothing exceptional out of all the places I've been to in Las Vegas. I would however think to come back and also recommend to friends!",

The Caesar salad, especially the dressing, was very good though, although I prefer a more authentic Caesar with anchovies which they do not offer.",

While the food has always been great, the service is hit or miss. To be fair,every time I have been here, the place has been packed, and extremely crowded and loud.  I will say that the quality of the steak is outstanding. They dry age the steak on the premises.  Portions are huge.",

The salad was great except for the croutons they are very crumbly and if you inhale as you put it in your mouth the crumbs can cause you to choke like I did! My Mac N Cheese was good and my steak even better. So juicy and amazing it was a tad bit on the raw side (I had asked for medium rare) but that's fine. My friend had the prime rib and he said it was one of the best he has ever had.   All in all I would definitely come back on my next Vegas trip and I will be bringing a few friends with me.",

    "text": "We visited last night, November 25th.  The good-   The decor is really nice, festive but not over-the-top, it wasn't distracting. I can't say that it's much like modern NYC, but it is very similar to many older and lovely San Francisco establishments. The aged steak was very good and worth the money. However, it does come on the bone and has fatty portions, so if that bothers you, please just order the filet. They are very similar in price and I find that there is no making up for those preferences. You will enjoy an un-aged filet much more than an aged new york strip.  The asparagus was excellent, it is so often overcooked.  The roasted garlic with the steak was a nice touch.  The medium-   The salads were a good size but in faux fine dining tradition, it is up to the diner to wrestle with enormous leaves and hunks of lettuce. Perhaps this is to your taste, but as I actually wanted to finish the salad, being served whole leaves in copious dressing was unfortunate. I ordered a Caesar, the dressing was nice but for $9 I expected something a little more robust. No anchovies were harmed in the making of my salad. My partner ordered the wedge and gave up after a third, although he liked it.  I was not impressed by the hollandaise. For the price ($2 additional) and quantity it was acceptable, but the white vinegar was very pronounced and the sauce was thin. They attempted to correct the acidity with shallots, it didn't really help. The consistency was fine otherwise.  The wine list was decent but a little spare on by-the-glass. Bottle prices are average but by-the-glass was a bit more expensive than similarly priced restaurants. The pour size is standard, about 5 ounces. For a party of 3 or more, I'd just order a bottle.  The bad-  Very misleading reservations. The restaurant was in no way full at the time requested but they forced us to reserve at an earlier time.   Guidance about ordering is lacking and the staff and kitchen may be at war. Although still lovely and tender, it was the single most done medium-rare I've ever had in my life, including my own occasional barbecue-related sins.  Did not try-  The beer or cocktails. I didn't even see a drinks menu other than the wine list.  Overall-  Good food, a touch pricy, and I'm not sure how much I believe their schtick about aging. The location is not thrilling, it's in a particularly irritating part of New York New York. Wait-staff was very nice, hostesses less so. Worth a trip, but skip the soup/salad.",

    "text": "It had been a while since I went to a traditional steakhouse.  And having been away from America for a while, and eating primarily chicken...it was a looonnng time coming.  Maybe that's why I enjoyed Gallagher's so much.  Maybe it was because it was just awesomely good.  I don't generally enjoy the NYNY casino, so I tend to not go in.  I was brought here by Zumanity though, attending with my girlfriend.  And since the love of her life is meat, the choice on where to eat was easy.  It all started with the drink.  A Manhattan.  I subbed olives, because maracschino cherries make me cringe.  And I got blue cheese olives, and a beautiful Manhattan.  I ended up getting 2 more, and the waiter complimented me on my drinking.  Haha.  He made me feel like a real boy!  So we got sauteed mushrooms and some steaks.  I went with the prime rib.  There's something magical about a perfectly seared steak, sure.  But I can't roast a rack of ribs at home.  And the slightly more cooked bits on the edge of the roast make a great salty counterpoint to the moist, tender, juicy middle bits.  Plus it comes with meat juice on the side.  Love me some meat juice.  Jen really liked her steak too.    All in all, I was thrilled by the service, who specifically rushed out bill so we could get out in time for our show.  I loved the food and drinks too.  A very classy place with an old school vibe, and made me feel like a regular.",

We decided to share an 18ounce cowboy ribeye med rare with 2 sides: creamed spinach and garlic mashed taters. Opting between crab legs and shrimp for appetizer we went with ginormous shrimp cocktails. First to arrive was house bread basket containing 2 football shaped stale cold sourdough loafs to practice throws while waiting for food. Shrimp was surprisingly fresh/good, cocktail sauce w. side of horseradish - winner.    Main course arrived and we were pleased to be greeted by such a fine hunky piece of meat (why hello there cowboy~). Sides were both a bit over seasoned but sufficient. Unfortunately, our piece of meat turned out more visually appealing than actual taste. Wahwah~  After couple bites we were over it so ended up doggy bagging most of meal to serve as car potpourri for next 4hr trip back home.",

    "text": "Tender. Juicy. Yummmmm   My family has been coming to Gallagher's Steakhouse since I was eleven years old. We even tried the original Gallagher's in New York and I must say, the meat in Vegas is much tastier! We came here on a Saturday night around 8 pm for my sister's 31st birthday. The food was great (there were some bad dishes, but the server took care of it for us), service was awesome, ambiance was perfect for the celebration and the wine we ordered was on point.   FOOD: When you come to Gallagher's you HAVE TO GET THE STEAK! The meat is dry-aged for 21 days. You can see the meat refrigerator in front of the restaurant with dates on how long the meat has been dry-aged for. We ordered the following dishes:   1. Clams, Casino: I was happy the clams weren't over cooked and they did a great job baking the clams perfectly so the inside was still juicy, but the top layer had a nice crunch to it.   2. Lamb Lollipops: The lamb was medium rare! It was seasoned well, cooked just the way we like it and it had a tasty green sauce on top that made the dish great!   3. Roasted Beet Salad: If you love beets and is craving a refreshing salad to enjoy, then I highly recommend this dish. The salad was a great serving size for two people to share and gave us a break from all the heavy foods like onion rings, meat, etc.   4. Center Cut Filet Mignon Medium Rare: I know the place is known for its dry-aged NY strip, but I preferred the filet mignon over the NY. It was so tender, well-seasoned, thick and succulent. I asked for extra candied garlic cloves as well on the side to enjoy with my filet mignon and garlic mashed potatoes. It's a smaller cut, so it was just the right amount for me. It couldn't have been more than 11 ounces. So if you want a bigger piece of meat, I would suggest the rib-eye.   5. Dry-Aged New York Strip Bone-In: This dish we originally had some issues with. The cut we received was really grizzly and chewy. My sister's fiancee chewed on the first piece for almost two minutes before finally spitting it out into his napkin. The waiter immediately noticed and gave us a new piece of steak that was dry-aged to perfection, seasoned well with a fine texture and buttery flavor. The fat marbling was excellent! You can also order a side of garlic cloves and the dish went well with the mashed potatoes as well.   6. Cowboy Rib-Eye: This is the fattiest meat and it came with the bone-in. The rib-eye we received was rich, tender and juicy. It had generous marbling throughout, but primarily on the outside. It was seasoned well, but I am not too fond of too much fat in my meats, so this was my least favorite. I've had better rib-eye elsewhere.   7. Sides: Mashed Potatoes and Onion Rings. (All dishes are ordered/charged separately). Mashed potatoes was amazing! I wouldn't order the onion rings again.   8. New England Clam Chowder: I am not sure if I've had better New England Clam Chowder anywhere else in Vegas aside from the Palace Station Oyster Bar. What I love about this dish is it's not too thick, but it isn't watery either. The ratio of clams, potatoes, bacon and veggies was great! It was enough to share between my husband and I.   SERVICE: AMAZING SERVICE! I always love coming here. The server was so attentive to us. We were seated in a more private area in the other dining room since it was my sister's birthday and the server still kept an eye on us. He switched our NY Strip when he noticed it was inedible. He served all the food within a timely manner and we were never left waiting long. The busser and hostess was also a pleasure to be around.  PRICE: For two appetizers, a salad and soup, three entrees and two sides, the entire bill including tip was around $290, which is not bad. There was 5 of us so it came out to roughly around $58 a person. This is reasonable for the size of all the dishes, service and quality.   Overall, I love Gallagher's!!! I am excited to come back again for the next family celebration.   Happy Dining,   J Tran",

By the time he brought it back, my steak was stone cold, and worse, I had ordered medium rare and it was cooked throughout.

    "text": "Well, I was originally going to give a 3-star rating, but upped it to 4 because my others in my party enjoyed their steaks.   We've eaten at Gallagher's several times before, but this experience was completely underwhelming. We went here for my dad's 65th birthday. Our waiter could really seem to care less about our table, so that was a bit of a disappointment for the amount of money being spent on our dinner.   I had the bone-in New York strip. The outside tasted burnt. I would take Capital Grille over this place any day. I left half the steak on the table. My dad enjoyed his prime rib. It was a huge cut and very tender. My mom and husband both enjoyed their filets as well. Decent size and also very tender.   While Gallagher's is usually a tradition for us on our Vegas trips, I think next time we'll try another steakhouse. There's too many steakhouses in Vegas to settle for average.",

The tables are placed too close to each other that I can hear everybody's conversation around me. I know that they are well known, but for the price that they charge, they should atleast make people enjoy their meals comfortably. Aside from that, everything is very good, from their food to their services. The servers where very nice and they are on top of everything from start to finish.   My husband and brother in-law ordered the rib-eye while I ordered the dry-aged rib eye steak. They were really good and cooked perfectly per your request (I like my steak medium-rare). I also had the fig and apple salad, and it was pretty awesome!  I might come back to this place, but next time, I will request NOT to be seated in the middle of the restaurant. So I can enjoy my steak, salad and good pair of red wine.",

It was like butter and music to my palate. Along with Russian  River Pinot Noir. And the bacon caramelized onion mashed potatoes. I was in heaven.  Plus my server Todd was flawless on timing attention and pleasant friendly treatment  like a pro. It's a high quality steakhouse so prices are not cheap but as far as value they are top notch.   There was nothing  I dislike even remotely. You have choice of bar with or without flat screen or for a bit of wait 5-10 minutes you can get a table. Hostess were so nice too.   I will be back every opportunity  I get.",

    "text": "I hadn't been back to Gallagher's for nearly four years and I took a chance that it was as good as I had remembered it. It is one thing to recommend a place to strangers and coworkers, and quite another to recommend a place to your *boss* and then bring him there. Never mind bringing HIS boss with you, too. No pressure, right?  I made a reservation for part of our team following a long day of work at a conference in the Mandalay Bay. We needed to get out for some air and had spent nearly a week cooped up in the convention center. I thought I knew just the place and made a reservation online using OpenTable.   Our table was ready at the reservation time, and our server, John, was fantastic. We were seated at the \"chef's table\" in the kitchen area -- which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on the restaurant and the people you're with. It turned out for us to be a good thing and we'll request that next time (it is a U-shaped booth that holds 7 people). Some of the people weren't as hungry, so they decided to split a steak and some appetizers. I just wanted the signature NY strip that I remembered.   The place was crowded, and it took a little time to get the food, but I don't think we were ever left wondering or looking at our watches. If you're in a hurry, though, this may not be the place for you. Good takes time, so be prepared to be patient :)  All of our steaks were cooked perfectly and the shrimp+grits appetizer was a group favorite. I'm not a shrimp person, but those \"shrimp\" were like little lobster tails! The side dishes were reasonable priced, and I recommend the mac and cheese with bacon in it if they have it. The peppercorn sauce was a few bucks more, but it was a nice accompaniment to my steak. There was enough to share, so I did, and those who tried it enjoyed it as well.   Beware the fresh horseradish with the prime rib -- it is pretty potent.   You'll have a big piece of meat, but be sure to save room for the toffee pudding... even if you have to share it like we did.   For the quality of service and food, the price we paid was more than reasonable and we will definitely be back when we are in town again next year. Thank you John for taking care of us!",

Ordered creamed spinach as a side and it came out cold so I had to return it. Creme Brulee was much cooler than I am accustom to but edible. Would have been nice if the table bread was warm to make it easier to spread the butter. Phone service was rushed but wait service was nice and polite. Prices are about average for the area. I've been here twice over a few years and I think it's time to move on try different steakhouses.... I mean it is Vegas.",

For this trip, we each had the chilled seafood appetizer, which was a large plate of ice with 3 items - a huge shrimp, a lobster medallion, and a giant cracked crab leg. Sauces included aioli and cocktail. I asked for a side of melted butter. The seafood was fresh and fantastic. We each ordered the filet and shared 2 sides: roasted vegetables and the mushroom medley. I got the whiskey mushroom sauce and my mom got the peppercorn sauce. We were both happy with the sauce we chose.  Both sides were great and the steaks were cooked perfectly. Dinner was amazing! On prior visits, I had the onion rings, which are also really great.",

They seem to not really care for having children or kids around in this restaurant. I ordered the surf and turf with filet mignon, we also ordered some oysters, ahi tuna and all of the desserts. We also got some hot tea and they come and ask you what tea you would like in a box of tea samples they have. I also ordered a martini fruit flavored which was pretty strong. Their Moscow mule was better though. Oysters were probably the smallest oysters I've ever seen in my life for a hefty price. It was still good but seriously the smallest things ever. What I liked most about my surf and turf was the crab legs. It was delicious. My filet mignon was pretty good as well but it was kinda rare in the middle which I asked for medium but it was more in the rare side right in the middle. My friend ordered a steak too and he didn't enjoy his steak as much so I felt bad. Maybe it was a little dry. All the desserts were fine and I enjoyed the creme brulee. Our bill came out to be around $500 for 4 people.",

We decided to eat here after seeing the dry-aged steak case that sits right outside the restaurant and then upon checking reviews, thought it would be a solid choice.  Service was above average, even though our server seemed very blah and overall not very friendly. Got the wedge salad to start and it was delicious. The other couple got the caprese which looked incredible. Steaks were another matter entirely though. My husband got the cowboy ribeye. It came already cut off the bone, which I have never seen before (and he has ordered this many times before). I got the dry-aged New York strip. We both thought our steaks were just okay. Just okay. Like, I have gotten better steaks at a Longhorn before, kind of okay. Super disappointing. What was even more disappointing is that the steak knives were so dull that I could barely even cut my steak. I mean what the heck? The sides were very good though. We got the parmesan herb fries and the other couple got the spicy cauliflower which were both delicious. But, it's a steak house though. So when you're spending $50+ on a steak (without sides), it should be good, right?  Also, if you order a tea or soda, they charge for refills (at like $4 a piece). Which I personally think is insane. I haven't left many reviews as of late, but I was so disappointed with this one that I thought I'd leave this so maybe others won't spend $200+ on a disappointing dinner.",

I ordered bacon mac and cheese, truffle Parmesan fries, and onion rings as my sides and OH MY GOD were they the best sides I've ever had. I was beyondddd pleased! It's amazing how they put such a unique twist on a classic. The prime rib, however, was a different story. It was nicely done, tender, but not very flavorful. Could have used a tad more salt. I also get very excited over au jus and the one served w/ that prime rib just left something to be desired. It was not bad it I've definitely had better.   Service: everyone was soooo nice and attentive! Never let my drink run low but also did not bug. The ambiance was old New York/romantic which was perfect.   Quantity/Price: So for what you get, it's actually REALLY reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I shared the prime rib and sides, as the sides are served family style. Keep in mind I'm def NOT a skinny girl (mama can eat y'know? ) and my boyfriend... well he's a big ol' Hawaiian dude w/ an equally large appetite lol. We were both so stuffed and didn't even finish the food. And w/ all the food, the check still came out to under $100.   Overall, I really really like this place and if I'm ever staying in this hotel again, you bet I will be eating here. 8/10 would recommend",

We came here after leaving the Vegas Knights game, my wife ordered a steak and since I was still full from lunch, I ordered the bowl of clam chowder and the seared ahi. The ahi was average, nothing special at all and the soup was below average. The clams were very dry and chewy.  My wife ordered her steak medium rare, it was clearly medium plus-medium well. Was very dry.  I also had the scotch-old fashioned. I could tell just how the drink was going to be when it arrive with multiple small ice cubes instead of an ice square or sphere... disapointing",

    "text": "My wife and I recently dined at this classic American Steakhouse. Gallagher's roots date back to the prohibition era in New York and they have been serving fine steaks in Vegas at New York-New-York since 1997.   The venue is \"old school\" with the dark wood and subdued lighting associated with the elite historic Steakhouses of years gone bye.   Now for the dining experience;   For an appetizer we had the Caesar Salad and the Shrimp Cocktail, both of which exceeded expectations.  The Shrimp cocktail in particular was impressive, with large, fresh shrimp dominating the plate.   My wife's had the 8 ounce filet for her main course which was up to the mark and was perfectly prepared and presented. The sides of peppercorn sauce and the cream spinach were also very good.   Unfortunately, the Bone In, NY Strip Steak was a huge disappointment, as it was served \"ICE-CREAM COLD!  I don't know how this can happen? Where and whom was this steak \"hanging out\" with? From a health standpoint, It's disconcerting when meat is left out and served a room temperature. I'm really not sure how or why this can happen.  In any event, I sent this steak packing and had to wait a half hour before getting another steak, at which time my wife had finished her meal and was ready for desert.   As for Gallagher's NY Strip, I do not recommend it.  It's a \"bone in\" steak that surrounds the meat on three sides making eating this steak a very difficult task. Also, the meat was very chewy, which is never my experience with this cut of steak.   For our troubles, Gallagher's did absolutely NOTHING! Not even an apology or an explanation.  This coupled with spotty service and the lack hands on management resulted in a 3 Star review.",

I'm not a huge calamari person, but it was good.  Try to cucumber martini if you like cucumber, so refreshing and delicious.  It doesn't have the kick back that a normal martini does, this one is so good!  Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas!",

Our sides were the yukon gold mashed potatoes and the mushroom medley. They were both delicious. The mushroom medley was an excellent side to the steaks we ordered. The yukon mashed was excellent. Creamy and buttery.   The NY strip I ordered was delicious. It was huge and sadly I couldnt finish it... It was cooked perfectly and writing about it makes my mouth water at the moment. The dry aging really brings out a flavor I really enjoy in steaks. I would certainly order again. The prime rib was really good as well. It was even bigger than the NY strip. It was also cooked exactly as we ordered.   Aris our server was excellent. He anticipated our needs and made for great conversation.  He should be commended.

    "text": "So much food!  That is the first thing I think when I think about our meal at Gallagher's, but don't mistake that as quantity over quality, it was top notch and in huge quantity.  On our last trip to Las Vegas, my girlfriend and I went to Gallagher's one night before heading to a concert.  Not having ever spent much time in NYNY, we headed over a little before our reservation just to check out the place.  I must say, the \"streets\" and some of the other restaurants are a neat setting and worth a stroll through on your way to the restaurant.  As we were walking through we were keeping our eye out for the restaurant, and as we turned a corner, we definitely could not have missed the very large display of aging steaks.  A neat touch to see the meat as it is being aged, and it made my decision of what I would be having for dinner very easy.  We made our way inside and were quickly seated and met our server who brought us some water, bread, and took our drink order.  The service was very professional and attentive without being too overbearing.  The restaurant itself is a very large area without too much separation, and as such, is a pretty loud place.  The wine list was pretty good, although I would have liked to have seen more options for wine by the glass. They also had a few house cocktails for those who prefer them. The one part that I was a little turned off about was the photographer that comes around and tries to take everyones picture to sell you later.  That seemed a little tacky.  The food!  After seeing the steak out front, we both knew we were for sure getting a steak to eat.  My girlfriend got the ribeye, while I opted for the \"famous\" aged new york strip.  Both steaks were fantastic and both steaks were GIGANTIC. I preferred the taste of the NY Strip, however, you cannot go wrong with either one. For sides, I ordered the baked potato and she went with the special which were mashed garlic mashed potatoes, and we were planing to split asparagus between the two of us.    I will know better and hopefully after reading you will too! We had enough food for about 4 hungry adults. I would say we each ate about half of our steak, and my baked potato was the largest potato I have ever seen in my life! We did make a good decision on splitting the asparagus, as that was about the right size to split!  ALL of the food was wonderful thought, even if we could not finish it all.  We were so stuffed we were not interested in dessert, but I did see some of the options at other tables and at least from what I could see it looked great as well (also enough to share, btw).  Overall, I was very happy with the service and the meal, and it was nice to get the opportunity to explore a casino we had not spent much time in.  I have been to some of the other very fancy steak restaurants in the town and would rank it right up there with any of them for the quality of the food and the prices were very reasonable for Las Vegas.  Just think about splitting some of the food unless you are absolutely starving.",

The worst part was the restaurant wasn't that busy, there were some empty tables. Our server was just bad. I ordered a New York strip, their signature steak, medium and it came out very well. Judging by the other patrons steaks this was probably no fault of the kitchen, more than likely it continued cooking while we waited forever for it to be brought to us. The shrimp cocktail, Brussel sprouts and steak fries were all good. We will not return, would rather try the other dozen high end highly rated steak restaurants in Vegas.",

Located in the New York New York hotel, it does a pretty nice job of creating an atmosphere that feel quiet and relaxing unlike the casino floor. Our group enjoyed the calamari appetizer, which was standard, nothing special. We also split the stuffed mushrooms, which tasted great.   For dinner I had the signature dry aged strip, cooked medium. I also had a baked potato on the side. The strip was cooked excellently, and the flavor was very good. I have not eaten a lot of dry aged steaks in my life, but I certainly enjoyed this one.   The service was excellent as well. Since you are on the strip this place is a bit pricey, so special occasions or to celebrate and big haul in the casino seem like what this place suits well.",

But this time I had the Alaskan King Crab. Three nice size legs split in half. My gf had the porterhouse steak.  Maybe a 20 minute wait for our food not bad considering how busy it was. By that time we noticed a long line starting to form outside.  My gf's porterhouse was perfectly done, she enjoyed it. It also came with bone marrow, first time she tried it. I tried it and didn't care for it.  Alaskan King Crab legs were nice and warm, very tasty.   Another great dinner at Gallagher's!",

But almost everyone of them I've had to spend over $100 per person to walk out with a full stomach. Gallagher's is high quality without the the high price tags! Cowboy ribeye, dry-aged for 15 days for only $42... at 22oz after cooked, it'll feed 1.5 average persons or one of me! My friend ordered the king prime rib and that would have easily fed the table. I estimate it was over 30oz! If you order it for one, skip the free bread! You want to make more room for the meat!  Service was good.

Gallagher's appeared to fit the bill, although the raw slabs of meat in the case at the entrance are a tad off-putting. I know that they are designed to show you what you're getting, but I'm one of those \"ignorance is bliss\" people when it comes to eating animals.   Nevertheless, we came in, were seated immediately -- side note: next to the kitchen, like practically IN THE KITCHEN. I have never been so much IN a kitchen in my life. We were about 5 feet from the cooks and the grills. I think it was intentional: along the same vein of the exposed butcher case, so you can see what you're getting and where it's coming from, but it was distracting.  Our waiter was very good. Made good recommendations, very professional and courteous. My mojito was excellent. I had a seafood sampler appetizer plate as my meal -- it had crabcake, shrimp, and calamari. The crabcakes were TO DIE for. The shrimp were good, and the calamari was fine, but not the best I've ever had. I wish I just got crabcakes. So delicious. I sampled some of my girlfriends steak and potatoes and they were just out of this world.   Service was superb throughout the meal; the servers came and cleared our plates quickly and then used that fancy schmancy scraper thing to clear the table of crumbs and such (I love that thing!).  I would ABSOLUTELY 100% recommend anyone on the strip have a meal here. I know I will be back my next round in Sin City!",

I feel like the steak was a little dry. But overall the dinner was good.",

Only reason it doesn't get 4 stars is because I'm really picky about giving 4 stars.  The steaks have a fantastic flavor that comes from the dry aging process which is on display in the store front.  Service has always been above average, and the atmosphere feels very classic.  I don't really have any criticism of the restaurant because it is exactly what the star designation says.  A-OK, and that should be nothing to sneeze at.  In Vegas where you have a million options to spend your dining dollars, Gallagher's delivers a steak worth going back for and a fun experience.",

Prices range from $7+ for sides and the NY was $52, which is to be expected from a Las Vegas Steak House. Two people and two glasses of wine is about $210 out the door, but it makes for a lovely evening.  When my husband called to make the reservation the hostess asked if we were celebrating, and he said it was our honeymoon. No one ever mentioned after we arrived, seems weird to ask the question and then not mention to us when we arrive?",

    "text": "Horrific.  Based on the waiter's recommendation was the NY strip aged steak medium rare.  So instead of going with the fish special I went with his recommendation.  I struggled so hard to cut the steak I even knocked off some of my sides.  I had a few bites which actually tasted ok but gave up eating because it was too much work.  He never came back to check on us and when he finally did show up I asked him about the steak and asked was it tough because it's aged?  He said no and if you had told me about it I would have changed it out for you but it's too late now.  Yet he never came back to check on our table so I did the best I could do with the steak I had.  I was so worried I was going to get ill after eating it.   Let me backtrack a minute where when I ordered a drink it came in a glass with lipstick on it and now I couldn't even cut my food?  $200 wasted.  Trust me, there are way better steak places out there don't waste your money there!  The sides we shared.  We had mac and cheese it was good but not thick and creamy, green beans were very good and that's basically what I had for dinner, and bread.",

So I heard about this steakhouse from my dad, claiming it was the best steakhouse in Vegas, and while I haven't actually been to any others, I do have to agree with him that it was very good.  I had the new york steak (35 dollars) a side of onion rings (7 dollars) and a glass of New Castle (8 dollars) which brought my total for dinner to like 50 dollars plus tax and tip. I'm not a huge spender on food, so 50 bucks is a pretty big drop in the bucket for me to eat, but overall I was very pleased with the food. The steak (cooked medium) came out perfect and was almost all meat (very little fat for a New York) and the onion rings were literally huge, not like the cheap kind you get at a fast food restaurant. Service was great. Our waiter happened to be originally from CA too, so he identified with a couple of guys in Vegas for the weekend and the food came out in a good amount of time.  Sure, I was dealing with a sick friend, and a overly drunk friend, both of who were bickering like preschoolers, but I enjoyed Gallaghers. Next time I'm in New York, New York, and have money to burn for a great dinner, I'll be stopping here!",

    "text": "First off just do yourself a favor and order the house special in house dry aged NY.  It's the best piece of meat on the menu as it's the only cut that is dry aged.    Made a late reservation after seeing Barry Manilow at the Paris.. which by the way was a much better show than I expected.  Upon arriving my co-worker and I were promptly seated at a small table somewhere in the back of the restaurant.  We both ordered the house cut NY steak with asparagus and steak fries.    Got bread and drinks and then out came the steaks.  Wow.. what a great piece of meat.  I'm definitely a fan of dry aged beef and this steak did not disappoint.  My co-workers steak came out a little overcooked and she was gonna eat it but I made them send it back.  The waiter was really great about it and he came back with a new steak like 3 minutes later.. ok so he stole it from another guys order but who cares right?  This steak was done just right and my co-worker was really glad I made them do that.    The sides of asparagus and steak fries were good, nothing to writehome about just average.    Their dessert menus are this weird backlit tablet thingy that's kinda hard on the eyes but nevertheless was kinda cool.  Honestly my steak was so good, I can't even remember what we got for dessert.    Overall the place could use a good scrubbing and maybe a face lift, but honestly I couldn't care less as long as they keep their prices decent and keep serving up delicious reasonable priced beef.  4 Stars!!  (I'd give it 4.5 if I could)",

The sides and drinks were the highlight of the meal. (I got a Gallagher74, I think that's the name-it was awesome as was the broccoli.) Our server was decent, the bussers were wonderful, the manager was phenomenal (tall white guy, short hair, super friendly) and we had a reservation so we didn't have to wait. The steak? Mediocre at best. They're specialty is NY strip- the toughest, most flavorless cut of beef. So, I got the rib eye, as did my boyfriend, since we both like some marbling- it was ginormous, but mostly \"marbling.\" My boyfriend said, \"I've had way better steak for a quarter of the price.\" Me: \"When?\" BF: \"When you make it at home.\" To be fair, I think they grill their steaks and don't let them rest before serving, which takes away a lot of flavor. Also, I like a warm pink center, so I ordered it medium well, it came out medium rare- not okay when you're paying $50 for 1 steak. The meal was definitely not worth the $250 we paid.",

Gallagher's was definitely the best option at NYNY so we didn't mind at all.  Dry aged beef lines the front of the restaurant, enticing the naive passerby to come check out their selection of prime cut steaks and chops.  Vintage pictures of stars and athletes line every bit of wall space that the moderate sized restaurant has to offer.  The relatively low ceilings and minimal windows create the appearance of a classic New York style supper house.    We arrived a few minutes before our reservation so I decided to jump on the shoe shining seat and have a good old fashioned hand shoe shine.  He made quick work on my shoes and I walked off with a seemingly brand new pair of kicks.  We walked in and it was surprisingly pretty crowded for a Sunday night.  We sat down near the rear of the back room, which sounds bad but it's actually pretty nice and quiet there and also it was near the door that leads to the restroom in the hall so it turned out to be a good spot.    Our server quickly greeted us and brought water and bread to our table.  We were torn on entrees and she was very eager to offer up some suggestions from her personal picks.  We agreed on the Ribeye and Rack of Lamb with sides of jalapeno mash and mushroom medley.  We also ordered the Crab Cocktail to start us off along with a bottle of a nice Chilean Red.  Crab Cocktail - Basically 3 sections of King Crab served with lemon and cocktail sauce.  No work necessary since it was sliced in half lengthwise for us.  Delicious.  Mushroom Medley - Great earthy side.  Not much to this so order if you love mushrooms.  Jalapeno Mashed Potatoes - Cheesy potatoes with a slight kick (very slight)   Salted perfectly and not too much cheese.    Ribeye - For me, a ribeye is a ribeye so unless you overcook it, the only thing left is the size of the cut and this cut was huge.  Served on the bone, this is not for the feint of heart.  Rack of Lamb - The star of the show.  Served medium rare is the key to perfection.  Basic seasonings along with a good sear makes lamb one of the best cuts around.  No different here.  Soooo good.  None of that mint jelly mess or paper booties needed.  We had lots of leftovers so we took some to our room to store in ice.  We also took some olive bread as well.  Great leftover lunch the next day.  We had a great meal here for a not-so-expensive price tag.  It was really good.  We would like to try some other cuts the next time we happen to be around here.  Oh, and there's a lady that walks around taking pictures if you would like.  She comes back with like sets of pictures that she prints out and places in photo folders.  I felt like it was high school grad or prom or something.   We got to choose 8x10 or 5x7 or wallet size.  Lol.   We ended getting just one picture in 8x10.  Felt bad but she shouldn't have printed them all out without asking what we wanted first.  For better profit margin, get a digital photo frame and show all the pictures to the customer so save money on ink and paper.  Nothing wasted except battery life.  But i digress...",

My wife's filet was also tough. Both cuts of meat were so bad even Sizzler's has better stuff.  My lobster was so rubbery I ate only half. The only good thing was her crab legs but anyone can cook crabs.  When the waiter brought the bill, he saw how little we ate and how we both had cut our steak in different places to try and get a decent tender piece but didn't say a word. I think we was afraid to ask how our meals were and just lay the bill on the table. Our bill came out to $245 and that was with no alcohol.  this was by far, the worst dinner I've had in Las Vegas and this has bothered me since I returned home (Hawaii) that I had to let everyone know so they don't get \"ripped off\" too,",

I don't know if I just went on a bad day but the steak was nothing extraordinary.    This place is located inside the New York New York hotel.  It's not the most upscale place (despite the dim lighting, I wouldn't say the decor was fancy/romantic) but I received an upturned nose from the hostess anyway.  Not really sure why....I was business casual even though this place is clearly casual dress code and all I did was say \"hello, I have reservations for party of 2\" so I can only assume that there was hint of racism in the hostess' misdemeanor.  What further ruined my experience was the table of drunk Canadian men sitting next to us that got progressively drunk as the meal continued.   If you are looking for an upscale steak restaurant, I would go somewhere else.",

We are SO glad we chose this place. For appetizer, we had the calamari. SO good. For dinner, I had the Queen cut Prime Rib (medium) and my husband had the Ribeye (medium rare). Both were huge, cooked perfectly and tasted AMAZING. As sides we had the macaroni & cheese and asparagus. Seriously, the macaroni & cheese is to die for. The hickory bacon in it makes it just amazing. We had so many leftovers that we took a doggy bag back to our hotel for a friend. It was about $100 for both of us, which wasn't too bad at all, and worth every penny.  The *only* complaint is that they sort of shoved us in a corner table (not sure if the fact that we are an obviously pierced/tattooed couple had anything to do with it), but a better table would have been nice. However, our waiter Phillip was very nice & seemed non-judgmental, so we didn't mind too much.",

I added wild mushrooms for $3, not worth it. it was about a tablespoon of string mushrooms that tasted like old cheese and wine. The bread they gave us was hard, so we both just stared at it while we waited for our steaks and talked about how fancy everyone was dressed.  *UPDATE* We were asked what hotel we were in I'm not sure if that's normal.",

I had a filet mignon which was really good and also really big - I don't think I've ever seen such a big one before. Hubby ordered lamb chops and was not too happy with them - they were also large but half of it was fat, so he had to cut a lot of it off.  I wasn't sure what I thought about the sides being offered a-la-carte. It's good that they bring them separately and you can share it, but $9 for a mediocre mash potatoes? It's a bit too much in my opinion.",

I do want to clarify that although I said I wouldn't go back, it's mostly due to the fact that we look for different paces unless it's exceptional. He explained that 8:30 was at the end of their dinner rush so staff may be a little worn down which I completely get. Understand, that when Yelp ask for a review it's only on a microcosm of time and may not be a True representation of the whole product.

My steak was good, but everything about this place is over-priced. $15 for sides? Come on, that's really pushing it. Maybe at Per Se, where extras for suckers have become one of their mainstays. Mushrooms or spinach, 15?? I have been eating prime rib at the place in NYC since I was a child. When I found out that this location had no prime rib and was given a business lecture to explain why, I should have left. But I wanted to give it a try. Today, steak is all over Las Vegas, so it really boils down to personal test. These over-the-top marvels of the modern meat-lovers havens are sometimes more show than go.",

I mean, it wasn't too bad.But, for the price I thought it should have been better.    For a commercial thing in Vegas, I mean it's a touristy thing, let the tourists have fun, they will like it.   I live in San Francisco and have a lot of really nice steak places to go to and I've eaten at many others which have had better cuts of meat and were cooked better.  We sent one back because it was well done and we asked for a medium.  It came out right away, no waiting an hour for them to cook another, I'm sure they 'borrowed' someone elses to get ours out quickly, which is nice.  But, that wasn't cooked much less than the first one. :(  The steak was pretty tough.   The lobster tail was a little over cooked.  If you're not used to going to really nice places, (My Mom ate with us and she isn't used to going out to places like this) and she had a great time and didn't know the difference.   If you know the difference, you'll probably want to go elsewhere.  We spent in the neighborhood of $500 for 4 people.  It should have been the best quality for that price.    Now, we didn't eat the cheap stuff either.  2 of us had the surf & turf with the lobster tail.  and a couple of glasses of wine.  We skipped dessert and they brought us one small one on the house, that was nice.  Like I said, the staff was perfect from start to finish.  The quality of the meal was the only problem.",

The service was just adequate. The appetizers (shrimp cocktails and crab cakes) were good. Four of us ordered their signature steak (Dry Aged bone in New York Strip) I like it medium rare. When I tried to cut into it I shook the whole table, it was that tough. Also the same with one of my guests. No problem 10 minutes goes by and the waiter returned with two new ones. Again... both were tough as nails. this time the manager came over and I showed him how bad it was. So I said lets just change both to a filet mignon. Manager asks what temperature would you like that? both medium rare please. another 10 minutes goes by and he returns with two new ones. My guests was done right however, I cut into mine and it was so rare it looked blue in the middle. I picked up my plate walked over to the manager and asked him what he thought it was cooked to? Hm... thats on the rare side he said. I said No... thats RAW! and go ahead and keep the steak Im done. I walked back to my table and guests. The worst part, the manager never came back to apologize or show any kind of empathy for that whole experience! Its not the fact I spent $650.00 for dinner where their supposed to specialize in steaks, and they had THREE times to get it right.  Its all about customer service when things go wrong. I will NEVER entertain my guests there again. By the way I was there 9/17/16 @ 6:00 in the room on the left side with the long table. I'm not sure of the server's name nor the Managers.",

It was a spontaneous decision to eat there and we were not disappointed. There was no wait. We got seated by he kitchen so we had a great view of all the meats on being grilled. Well, all of us of course ordered steak. They only had one type of meat that they aged, and that is the New York strip. It would have been better if they had other selections that they dry aged. The steak was delicious. The waiter's recommendation of getting it medium cooked is perfect. The meat was juicy, tender and flavorful. We also ordered a couple sides. Their mashed potatoes with asiago chedder was their side of the day and it was super yummy. The staff was overall nice and very attentive. They even let one of our friends take a picture of the kitchen area. The price is fair for what they serve. Expect to spend over $100 for two. Maybe more if you order alcoholic drinks with your meal.

My filet didn't have as much flavor as it could have and my lobster tail was slightly over cooked. However, I am not saying the meal was not good and that you should not go here; I had heard a lot of hype about this place and I do not think it lived up to that hype. My boyfriend got the Cowboy Ribeye and asked for it medium rare plus and his was definitely medium rare if not a little more rare. He doesn't like it like that so barely touched his plate (we don't like sending food back if we don't absolutely have to). If you are big steakhouse connoisseur like us then I recommend maybe trying a different place.",

New York New York is one my favorite casinos, after seeing Gallagher's many times, my wife and I decided to give it a try. We made reservations with some friends and had dinner there on Saturday night.   Standard steakhouse treatment, prices as expected and the food offering very similar to what other steakhouses offer. Our waiter Derek had a great attitude and he was probably the highlight of the night. Derek suggested that we tried the signature steak, Dry-aged New York steak. We also ordered a wedge salad and sauteed mushrooms to share. After eating the salad my wife fell nauseated and could not even eat her steak, she has to asked for it to be boxed. She is allergic to MSG and nausea is one of the reactions that she gets when eating a food that contains MSG. Do you know if your ranch dressing contains MSG? This is something important as some people are allergic to this product.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the flavor was really good. The mushrooms met the expectations. They served parmigiana and olive bread, they would be better it they were served warm.   The best part of our meal was the desert, We ordered the Sticky Tootsie was served with vanilla ice cream, it was just spectacular!!! The best desert I have tried in a long time.",

My wife and I decided that the 22 oz. cowboy ribeye was big enough to feed both of us and so we asked if it could be split. They were more than happy to split it for us (as long as we both wanted it cooked the same way). We ordered it medium and it was a nice pink all the way through. We had an appetizer of calamari and sides of green beans and a special bacon, chipotle mashed potatoes. Everything was excellent. The sides were more than enough for us to split. In my younger days I would've tackled the full steak, but now as I am pushing 50, the split steak was perfect.   After dinner we split the creme brulee. My wife had a coffee and I had a cappuccino. It was a great end to a great meal.",

When choosing a location for our anniversary dinner, I went back and forth and eventually we settled on this lovely steakhouse located in New York, New York. Once we made a reservation online, it was smooth sailing from there! The atmosphere was great! Really reminded me of being in a classic New York eatery.   For starters, we started with Lobster Bisque, which was very flavorful. This set the tone for the rest of the meal. For sides, we ordered the creamed spinach, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes... and they were all admirably, if not spectacularly, done. The dry aged cuts were simply breathtaking. I've enjoyed many over the course of my life, but these were cooked to perfection. Can't say enough about these steaks! The meal was definitely the highlight, but the service was impeccable! Kudos to the wait staff for making it an excellent dining experience!  Gallagher's is actually quite affordable for a steakhouse (all of your classic cuts of steak will range somewhere between $40-$80, the appetizers hover around $15, and the sides just barely stay in single digits), but I'd recommend it without hesitation if you appreciate a fantastic steak!",

    "text": "So we are self proclaimed Meat Heads.  We love a good steak and often seek out a good steak house when we travel.  We love love love the Gallagher's in New York City, so when we realized there was a Gallagher's at New York, New York here we jumped at the chance to have a little taste of home in Las Vegas.  I am sad to report that this Gallagher's is a poor substitute for the original.  It doesn't even qualify as the first runner up... for the $1.98 beauty pagent.       What makes Gallagher's exception is not just their steaks, which if you visit the one in Manhattan are on display as they are aged on the premises, but the experience.  Their service, the atmosphere with all the old pictures on the walls of former famous patrons along with their traditional steak house menu, cuts and sides are all part of the package.       The one in Vegas falls short of an exceptional experience on every count.  Our usual order is the Porterhouse for two with creme spinach, mash potatoes  and the house salad. We were so disappointed by the lack of service.  Our steak was practically dropped in our lap without so much as a word of explanation or a offer to serve a single piece.  This lack of service is only over shadowed by the fact that they can not possibly be using the same meat purveyor or method of dry aging.   The quality of the steaks is not the same as Manhattan restaurant.   There are no steaks on display or visible aging room. The pictures on the walls in Las Vegas look like they came out of the MGM studios set design or art department, not collected over years of actually services.  I am pretty sure Rock Hudson and many of the others were six feet under before the Vegas location ever broke ground.     On a positive note the steak was good (not great) and did come out cooked appropriately to order.  The Moscow Mule I ordered had a nice blend of ginger and lime.  I really enjoyed the cocktail.  I suppose if I did not know the original, I might feel differently.  However, for me the only similarities between the Manhattan Gallagher's and the New York, New York Gallagher's in Vegas are the prices.  So go once if you must just to say you have, but after that, save your Gallagher's experience for the next time you are in Manhattan.",

However, my husband ordered the cowboy ribeye steak, medium and it was really salty and dry. He said it tasted more like a sirloin or another type of lean steak so that was disappointing.     For the sides, we ordered mac n cheese and mushrooms.   The mushrooms were also super salty. My total bill was $130 before gratuity and for that amount of expect better.   It was a nice experience but I wouldn't come back.",

We had made reservations and were seated promptly when we arrived despite being a few minutes late.   The menu has several steaks, salads, and seafood. Everything is a la carte. You can customize your meal anyway you want.   We chose the New York strip steak.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly. So well in fact that the left overs were just as delicious and almost as melt in your mouth good as at dinner. The shrimp cocktail appetizer and the lobster tail were wonderful. Fresh. Tasty. We chose to share horseradish mash potatoes. Yummmm. It was a great accompaniment to the steaks.   The portions were on the generous side. So much that we could not finish our meal and took leftovers home.   Still when you have had such a good meal you're at least curious about the desserts.   Yes I peeked and they had a nice selection I chose to take the sticky toffee pudding with vanilla bean ice cream. Loved it.  Soo good. We all enjoyed every bite.   We found our dining experience relaxed and pleasurable.   The tab isn't for the faint of heart or those on a budget. It was our splurge on this trip and we don't regret one bite, minute or cent spent dining here.",

I enjoy beef tartare but prefer a steak be MW  Received the apologies and a second order of Truffle Fries at no cost but realistically, I'm not visiting again. I'm providing two stars because the bartender (Aaron) was awesome (attentive, prompt, friendly, professional).",

My BF and I had a reservation and I have to say, I have zero complaints about our visit, the service we received and the food/drinks. From start to finish, we had excellent service and our waiter was wonderful. I wish I would have caught his name because he deserves to be acknowledged.   As with any good steakhouse, the bill will be pricey but worth it if the steaks are just right and that's exactly what they are at Gallagher's. We had a rib eye, lobster, NY strip, wedge salad, garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Steaks cooked perfectly, sides...amazing. The sticky toffee cake our waiter suggested was one of the best desserts I've had at a steakhouse.   Aside from our meal being just about perfect, the service was top-notch and for a full-house on a Saturday night, I appreciated how fast our drinks and food came out. This will be a place we frequent for sure while in Vegas as it's worth every single penny.",

Hopefully this helps you fix your terrible customer service issues. Or don't read this and lose customers. At this point I don't care. You've lost a regular customer.   0 stars. This is my first 0 star review. Absolutely worst experience for me in a long time. Well over a decade.   I have eaten at Gallagher's countless times. Will never eat here again. The prime rib was one of the best I have eaten. Everything had nice portions. King crab was worth the price. As a family we were excited to eat here.   Customer service here is atrocious. Best part was  getting a seat. No problems there.   Worst part was getting any kind of service.   As you can see by their text messaging system we attempted to eat here at 4:28 on a Monday. Not many customers. I believe there was 1 gentleman by himself, and a group of around 5.   There was two of us. We were absolutely ignored. Plenty of wait staff standing around. Plenty of servers. We waited for around 17 minutes. You can see by the time stamp as we were leaving.   15 minutes into this a couple comes in. Not a minority. They get serviced right away as they were sitting down. They ordered their drinks and food. They were sitting right across from us at the next table. After realizing we weren't going to get serviced here for whatever reason I don't think it's relevant at this point we decided to leave.  It was hugely disappointing considering this is a place we looked forward to.    I am a minority. I'm very unassuming. I do well for myself, but when I'm on vacation I don't dress the part. Was with my kid. I hate to expose my family to this part of society but it's still alive. We were looking forward to some of the best prime rib I've ever had. This never happened.   Profiling, discrimination, don't judge a book by its cover. Call it what ever you want.   My suggestion is do your research. I gave you the info. Review your cameras and draw your own conclusion.",

Even the manager had a horrible attitudes and greeted nearly everyone but us.  I'm fine with high prices however my boyfriend had them bring out a cake and in the middle of them singing to me the waiter whispers in MY ear \"there is a cake fee just so you know\" we were told it was a slicing fee however I sliced it myself.. $5 a person for that.

It was roughly a 80% whiskey, 20% Sprite mix, it was perfect. Ordered some crab cakes, and they were amazing. They were delicate and crunchy at the same time, and the sauce that was provided was delicious. I also ordered the wedge salad, and it had to be the best Ive had. Seriously, how do you make a wedge salad delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, and my only regret was that i couldnt bring over the leftovers. I could almost cut it with my fork, it was so tender. Its not cheap here, but its definitely worth it.",

Old fashioned - always busy - wonderful prime rib and steak at New York New York. I had the prime rib the first time, it was super big and filling - excellent choice. This time I had the rib eye and it was also delicious, although the prime rib would be my first choice. They somehow ran out of lobster tails that evening..oh well!

For our sides, we ordered sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach, and their daily special which was a roasted onion mashed potato.  The steaks came out with sides.  I cut into the steak which was tender.  Took my first bite...no taste.  Second and third was the same.  Asked the others on the table if it was me or the steak.  They all said agreed that the steak had no real flavor for being aged.  Other than being tender, it was a regular steak.  Would not spend that kind of money at Gallagher's again.",

I ordered the Dry Aged New York Strip(rare) and bacon mac and cheese.  Service was good as expected on any $50+ meal.  After ordering, it was about a 40 minute wait to receive my food despite the fact that I wanted it rare.  Steak tasted great and I surprisingly didn't have room for dessert.",

When we first arrive, the hostesses completely ignored our existence for about 5 minutes and then turned up to greet us. When we finally sat, our waiter came over and took our drink order. He was really nervous and was there on minute and would disappear the next. Our drinks also took forever. We figured he might have been new so it was okay. We ordered the appetizers which were the shrimp cocktail and the bourbon smoked bacon. The bacon was really good and they give you a nice slab. The shrimp were huge so that was definitely a plus. When it comes to the main entrees the rack of lamb, the branzino, and the tomahawk steak were ordered. The steak is cut table side and the bone on that thing is insane! The steak was good, but nothing out of this world. You would think with the aging process and all the hype that it would blow you away. It was good don't get me wrong, but not enough for me to want to come here for a steak again. There was no nice char on it and it wasn't all that melt in your mouth feel. My mother in law said the rack of lamb was amazing and she even had to share because they gave her a large portion. The branzino was also tasty! The parmesan and truffle steak fries were one of the sides we really enjoyed and the mushrooms were good. Would I dine here again if I came to Vegas, probably not, but at least we gave it a shot after that beautiful aging meat display they have outside.",

I ordered King Crab Legs - the portion I received took over half the table and I needed help to finish.

We had dinner here on the New Year's Eve, we were lucky enough to be able to get a reservation at 7:15pm; we arrive at 7pm but the hostess asked us to check with them right at 7:15pm with an impolite attitude. That was kind of odd, why can't we be seated a little earlier if we arrived early? Unlike we have arrived at 6:45pm. Not to mention we had walked over here all the way from Fashion Show mall - one star off here.  However, it got all better after we sat down! We were served by a nice gentleman; we ordered their prime rib and aged new york steak, and oh my god they tasted extremely flavorful and juicy!  We also had their creme brule, not the best we had but still very fresh.  Would definitely come back here when we go visit Vegas next time!",

The service here was outstanding.  From the moment I sat down I felt like I had everything I wanted exactly when I needed it.  I sat at the bar, since I was eating alone, and the bartenders and servers were easily accessible.  I could not rave more about the service because it was as good as it gets.  The food was outstanding as well.  I started my meal off with a bowl of their very tasty New England Clam Chowder. I then ordered the New York Steak and the cheddar and chive mash potatoes (which was the \"special spud\" of the day).  The steak had great flavor.  My only complaint was that it was a little tough.  The mash potatoes were amazing!  I'm salivating thinking about them right now.  The meal was a great combination of food, and I was ready for a long nap after I was done.  I could not finish everything, but I was happy that I got to try it all.  I am really glad that Gallagher's was recommended to me.  It was an excellent experience and I will be sure to come back again the next time I want a great steak meal in Las Vegas.",

Once we choked down the old fashions we decided beer was a safer option, hard to screw that up.  Waiter disappeared for 15 minutes, so we waived someone down and said we wanted to order some beers. He said he'd send our waiter. Instead two more old fashions showed up. Sent those back and ordered beers from the waiter.  Food finally shows up, steak was ok, cooked properly, right on the inside, but seemed pretty charred on the outside and overall was cold, like it had been sitting around a while. With the creamed spinach, the spinach was hardly done and overall was not very creamy. The mushrooms were a great mix of mushrooms with a nice smokey flavor, but also cold like they'd been sitting around even longer than the steak.   No idea where the other reviewers have been eating but if you've had a good steak in Seattle, San Francisco or Chicago, stay clear of Gallaghers.",

So let me start by saying that I'm giving this two stars because service was great and that was it. I took my parents here when they came to visit. So after checking Yelp for reviews but never thought that most reviews were from people that don't live here or go to steak houses much being that they're here for vacation that's it. My mother and I had ordered the 3 month aged New York strip and my Dad ordered the Ribeye. We also ordered 3 sides and some drinks. After cutting into it and trying it I was not impressed at all. For being aged and some what of a big deal for the restaurant I honestly could have made the exact same steak at home. The sides were not bad but to me were too small of a serving compared to other restaurants. I can also say the price was not bad compared to other restaurants being that after all the food and also three drinks and two beers the bill was only $250 which in my previous experiences was about $100 lower than usual. So let me end this by saying you want to try a different steakhouse before ending up here.",

    "text": "I went there this weekend with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner. We were seated promptly at 7:15 (reservation time). It was a Saturday night so the place was packed, the service was great! Our waiter was attentive and made us feel like we were the only people he was serving.   I had the prime rib, medium rare, and the boyf had the cowboy rib eye medium rare as well. The meats were well cooked and delicious.  The prime rib was one of the best I've had. We had the cream spinach, it was  really yummy! The blue cheese dressing they have is sooooo good! Order the wedge salad, its a must!  I look forward to dining here again!! The prices are reasonable for a steak house. The sides are far less expensive than most places at $8-$10.  Dinner for two at about $140 (we didn't order alcohol).   P.S.  There's this lady that walks around taking cute pictures of you and your date, she sells the 2 portrait album for $45, (optional, she totally walks away if your not interested).",

    "text": "A great steakhouse amongst the excess of options that Vegas provides. We arrived at 7 on a Thursday and had reservations, though the place was not busy enough to require them. I ordered the filet mignon, medium, and my wife ordered the prime rib, also medium. Both were cooked perfectly, and the quality of the meat was extremely high.  For sides we had the yukon gold puree, very tasty, and green beans, also very tasty. They have a great drink selection, some nice house cocktails (I had the Fire and Ice I believe it was called, a fun mix of cucumber and jalapenos), and the service was great.  The only downside was the location/atmosphere. The entrance is directly from the casino floor, which I tend to like the restaurants set back more from the crowds, but once we were in the restaurant our table was seated far back inside, and it was nice and quiet.  Overall, a great place to eat for a nice meal with amazing steaks. Would definitely go back",

    "text": "We dined here for dinner on Thanksgiving Day with our good friends that were visiting from Hawaii. I don't know where to begin, but this place was such a disaster.  Service was horrible and slow. Extremely slow. So it was Thanksgiving night and they were busy, but it wasn't a full house in the restaurant. Our server (I guess I'll be nice and not mention his name) was never around. I think we only saw him 3 times. The first time was when he took our orders. Then he disappeared for an hour. We also waited over an hour for our food. He finally zoomed passed us right before we got our food, and then WE had to flag him down to get some drinks. The third time, he brought us the bill. Horrible. The guy who refilled our waters provided better service!   The food wasn't too great in my opinion. The bread that they served us in the beginning was too hard and the butter was pretty frozen. I ordered the center cut Filet Mignon. The glaze on top of it was tasty, but the rest of the steak lacked flavor. It was also kind of dry. The bottom line: it needed salt. I also ordered the seasoned jumbo steak fries as my side. The seasoning made them taste weird. I couldn't really figure out was it was but it did leave a spicy after taste. The steak knives that they gave us were very dull as well. My husband and one of our friends ordered the dry-aged New York Sirloin. They both said it needed salt. Our other friend ordered the queen cut prime rib and enjoyed it. So at least one of us liked our food.   FYI - the bathroom is a hoax! You open the first door with a sign that says \"restrooms.\" Then it leads you to a second door with a sign that says \"restrooms.\" When you open that door, it leads you to the nearby restrooms in the casino. LOL.  The bottom line: Not recommended and the steaks need salt. You know its bad when you have to have salt, A1, ketchup, and whatever else to make your steak edible!",

It came cooked perfectly, and the cut itself was high grade beef, not like at those \"prime rib deal\" places. The creamed spinach and mashed potato (with a trio of aged cheese) were the perfect compliments. My daughter had the New England clam chowder and it arrived filled with clams. She was so stuffed, her calamari was barely touched even though it's lightly breaded and deep fried preparation was too much for me to resist. You can expect excellent service to go with the meal. I will definitely try their signature steaks next time we are in Vegas.",

We did talk to waitress and she offered free drinks just to my husband and I not the other people at the table that had crappy steaks also. After talking to the manager she did end up taking off one steak again ignoring the other people's complaints at the table. We still got charged the 18% tip for the crappy meal. I was looking forward to coming to Vegas to have this great steak and it was terrible. Never again will we put it on our todo list.

From the moment we walked in, the staff was professional but friendly and were seated right away. As you look around, there are pictures of iconic figures all around. We were seated in a back room, walking through a half full main area near the bar, then past an empty area to a back room. I jokingly said to the hostess \"Did you hear about us? Is that why we are going to the back all alone?\" She told me that they just opened this area. I countered with \"If no one else is seated in this area in 10 minutes, we are moving to the main area.\" Would you want to sit in a giant room all alone? Sure enough another couple was seated near us and the hostess just smiled and winked at me.   Dinner was a Rib-eye for me with crispy onion strings and the house specialty, the Sirloin.  We also ordered green beans and steak fries. If there was a word that completely describes the deliciousness of this steak, I haven't found it yet. Our waiter Aris suggested a dessert that we could share of Toffee pudding. It was fantastic.   Overall this is one of the best places to eat in NY NY.

Finally on our Feb. 2017 trip we made advance reservations for Valentines Day and had dinner there before our 8pm show at The Park theater next door.  Here's the good. The place is nice looking enough. Our server Derek was fantastic -- very personable and excellent at his craft. In addition to him, there's a person that busses the table and came by often to make sure our water glasses were always topped off.  And after our salad course made sure all bread crumbs were wiped from the table (a bread basked of sour dough French and cranberry rye is served). Truly great service!  We each had Caesar salad that was very fresh. Served on a flat plate, the romaine leaves are left long, drizzled with dressing and croutons. So one cuts the lettuce themselves. Salad was tasty.  We ordered 3 sides -- creamed spinach, mushroom medley, and pureed Yukon gold potatoes. Sides were okay.  Here's the thing though.....ordered their Signature steak -- NY Strip bone in ($48). Ordered medium rare and cooked perfectly. Problem was the meat. It had grizzle and way too much fat. It just was a poor cut of meat and they tout it as their Signature cut?!?!  Derek was sympathetic and offered amends.  He offered to have them cook a new one, but we did not have time for that with our upcoming show. He offered to comp dessert but again didn't have time or cared for dessert then either. I thanked him, told him I appreciated that and we'd just take the check. He brought the check and he didn't charge us for either salad. Really a stand up thing to do and I didn't even ask for any compensation.  So 5 stars for service, 5 stars for knowing how to take care of a customer.....but darn it.....it's a steakhouse and the steak just wasn't good. Maybe we'll give them another shot one day.",

    "text": "The filet came drowning in this awful sauce, despite this not being referenced on the menu.  Really, I'm paying $50 for a top quality steak just so you can ruin it with some silly sauce?    I could have been eating chicken or fish, the sauce was so strongly flavored, it would have been impossible to tell.  I sent it back and they brought me a naked steak, but they didn't season it.  The by the glass Wine Menu is laughable for a steakhouse of this supposed quality.  I'm surprised they didn't have Barefoot listed--that was about the quality level of most of their wines.  The Creme Brulee was way overcooked and chewy.   Our waiter was really good, but everything else about   I'd recommend picking pretty much any other steakhouse in Vegas.  Frankly, there's a Nathan's hot dog at NYNY, even that would likely be a better choice.",

    "text": "So good this is now our go to place for a nice meal in Vegas, well this and Oscar's downtown. Not only do they have the nicest wait staff and bartenders on the strip, the food is delicious. Portions are large enough to split if you order a couple sides, the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach are favorites. The shrimp cocktail is huge and has a bit of a spicy kick. The filet is tender and flavorful but the prime rib...so good and it's at least half a cow in size. I'm very picky with prime rib and now Gallagher's is #2 in my top 5- 1. La Cave in Costa Mesa,  2. Gallagher's Las Vegas, 3. Houston's in Irvine, 4. Captain Jack's Huntington Beach and 5. Northwood's Inn La Mirada. Sit at the bar for people watching and faster service, we make reservations as backup in case the bar area is full.",

I heard that's medium rare in Vegas and have nothing against blood on my plate, so maybe it is ok. - The meat itself was good but why so underseasoned? We prefer our steaks seasoned aggressively with black pepper and truffle salt. Comparing to this, Gallaghers steaks had no special taste at all. - The only thing worth to come back - seasoned jumbo steak fries. One of the best fries ever! - Oysters Rockfeller - tasty and seasoned nicely. - Service was great, our water glasses were filled timely. - Why keep an annoying lady with camera walking around asking if you want a picture??  Overall: I believe there are better places to have a good steak in Vegas so we will keep searching for it.",

Our drinks were never empty, water was always filled and the wine was always being poured.  Excellent service!  As for the food, I'm not a huge meat eater so I decided to forego the whole reason behind this restaurant and opt for 1lb. of King Crab legs and then munch on a few bites of steak from other plates in our party.  My legs were quite substantial, however they got cold fast since they come split in 1/2.  Not a bit deal, but when you're paying $45 for a plate of food you'd like it to be warm.  I also had the chance to taste the New York Strip and Ribeye, both cooked to perfection, nice and tender.  Our table decided to order several sides to share including the asparagus, mac and cheese and something else that escapes my memory (too many bottles of wine).  All the sides were absolutely amazing and the asparagus was cooked perfectly.  Great experience eating at Gallaghers and I would certainly recommend it to anyone.  Know before you go:  the bathrooms are a mile away so don't drink too much!!",

My husband cooks better steaks from Publix than Gallagher's cooks its dry aged steaks. Also drinks took a while to come out, and the sides didn't make up for it, the mac and cheese was bland and I didn't care for the consistency, overall very disappointing, I wouldn't go back.",

Yay!   Ordered the ribeye, porterhouse, yukon potatoes, asparagus, bacon mac and cheese. Oh and request a side of roasted garlic if you're a garlic lover! (It's not on the menu) my husband and i both thought the ribeye was the best but the porterhouse was seriously neck and neck. We plan on revisiting and ordering everything the same!  Everything was seriously so good, the most moist delicious flavorful steak I've ever had and I've been to steakhouses triple the price in California. Amazing.   For drinks we got a moscow mule, ew ick save your money! And a white Russian, yum!!  And lastly, our waiter chris was very very very friendly.

Since we were staying at New York New York, I called down to the concierge to make a reservation for our dinner and let them know we were celebrating an anniversary.  They said the reservation was made and all I had to do was show up.  We show up at our reservation time only to find out that our reservation wasn't actually made.  Not sure if that's the concierge's fault or it was lost in the mix at the actual restaurant.  Either way, I was a little annoyed.  Our server was Bryan, and he was great.  He was very descriptive with the menu options we had questions about and was open about letting us know what his personal favorites were.  My husband went all out and ordered the New York New York which included their dry aged strip steak and a whole lobster.  I went for my usual 8oz filet mignon with a side of mashed potatoes (potato puree is what they called it).  As a starter, we decided on the fried calamari.  A trio of bread was brought to our table, which is always nice.  Their olive bread was different, but a good different. It had that briney flavor, but it wasn't too overpowering. Almost immediately, our calamari came out.  It was perfectly crispy and flavorful, but a little on the chewy side.  A few minutes later, our entrees came out.  My filet was ordered medium and came out more of a medium well.  Not juicy at all.  My husband's steak was cooked perfectly, but the lobster tasted like it was left in the water for maybe a minute too long...again, a little chewy.  Service was great, but the quality of the food wasn't what as we expected.",

I knew if I didn't get here a good steak she would throw a fit all night, so I opened my wallet and fed the beast. First off, I would suggest making a reservation here if you don't want to wait awhile, this place gets busy and stays busy. We arrived at our reserved time and were seated right away in a little corner of the restaurant. It was a nice cozy little table, a little too little, but was situated where there was less noise. The restaurant was extremely loud due to the proximity of the tables, so just don't expect the most romantic dinner out here.  The service was spectacular, 5 seconds after we were seated, our drink orders were taken and the menu was explained to us. All portions of the meal were perfectly timed and the servers worked with me to get us to our 930pm show on time.  As for food. We got the seared diver scallops as an appetizer, caesar salad as the second dish, and the dry aged new york strip and cowboy ribeye steaks with the bernaise sauce. Sides are ala carte and served separately, but I ordered the creamed spinach and grilled asparagus. Everything tasted great, but the steak portions are no joke, the pictures on this page do them no justice. I barely finished half of my steak and had to take the rest home. If I could go back I would have eliminated one of the sides from my order and possibly even the caesar salad and I would have still been full. Gallagher's steaks seemed a little tougher than what I was used to, perhaps it was because they were dry aged, or maybe because they were just that thick of a cut. My bill with all of the above and 1 glass of wine came out to $169.  If you are in the area give Gallagher's a whirl, and come hungry.  P.S. the leftovers were delicious.",

We were in a hurry to catch a Cher show at the Park, so sat at the bar, ordered a bottle of champagne and ordered our meal. My salad came lacking the cheese the bartender had said would be on it. I mentioned it to him and he expressed surprise but didn't offer to get some for me. No big deal.  Then the medium rare filet arrived medium well, and it was stringy, dry and tasteless.  We didn't have time to request a new one so I ate it. Next day, I wished I'd sent it back, but with the champagne and everything, I didn't want to kill the evening. So very very disappointed.",

It's my favorite restaurant in town.   When I get in steak debates with people, I insist that they come here with me. I'm more than happy to buy them a meal (avg. plate about $45 pp)  to show them what dry aged meat can be. Gallagher's nails it with perfect broiling. I usually get the cowboy ribeye. Despite being almost the size of a dinner plate, it's always impeccably cooked.  The texture of the steak is what will win you over. Tender, soft-cutting, and sooooo easy to eat. A medium cooked ribeye from Gallagher's is something I daydream about. You'll see.   All of the sides are incredible. And huge. My favorite are the steak fries. Forget what you're picturing in your head: this is a HUGE baked potato, quartered lengthwise, coated with spices and served with a killer spiced ketchup sauce.   Also try the pork chops (huge) and just about any of the desserts. Creamed spinach is also very, very good.  Again, this is my favorite place to eat in a city full of great eateries. Don't miss it.",

Seriously the BEST filet Mignon I've ever had and I'm a midwest girl so I guess that says a lot...cooked to perfection!  I ordered the Filet with Bearnaise and we split one of their side specials...blue cheese bacon mashed potatoes (also YUM!).  My husband got the New York Strip, which I believe they age in house and he said it was easily the top 4 steaks he's had (he's way more of a steak guy than I am) and it was enormous!  I think we could have had about 3 baskets of the grain fruit bread they offered with the meal as well.  Our server was spot on and very helpful.  The only downside, which you could tell management was trying to remedy, was a group of middle-aged drunk guys who were being really loud and obnoxious (won't deduct any stars for those idiots' disruption).  After the meal, we were offered a dessert menu and my husband asked the server if they had any birthday desserts since we were celebrating.  The server brought out a little scoop of cookies n' cream ice cream with a homemade birthday chocolate and candle...nice touch :) Definitely made for a special evening and we will surely come back when we visit Vegas again.",

I had a Porterhouse.. the price was a warning sign. If you are paying $45 for a New York and your porterhouse has a combined New York and Filet but yet it only costs an extra $5 chances are you are getting a little less than both.    I got a thin porterhouse that was shoe leather. Too thin to cook to rare/medium without burning it.  The wait staff picked up something wasn't right, I just told them it wasn't acceptable,and that I wanted a bone in New York as a replacement. Instantly the steak was gone, and the manager came out and apologized, and I got my replacement steak rather quickly.   The New York was very nice and one of the better ones I've had at a restaurant. Flavor was buttery with a nice taste due to the aging process. Very tender.. even the fat was good.  The Caesar Salad was average, but the wedge salads were pretty good. Salads weren't huge for the price, but the presentation was nice.  No comments on the seafood we never had any.  Service was excellent, however it is Vegas, so don't be surprised you're sitting next to a couple in beach attire.  The price is average  for USDA prime steakhouse.",

Hubby and I swapped a bite of our plates and agreed both our steaks were perfect. My steak standards are high but this place hit the mark!!! I devoured my entire pound of steak.

    "text": "I've eaten at a few Vegas steakhouses (not too many) and really enjoyed Gallagher's. If you haven't tried dry aged meat you owe it to yourself to try it at least once, it has an \"earthy\" type that you'll either love or hate. I've had it once before and really liked it, my wife wasn't sold on the idea so she ordered a non-dry aged filet and enjoyed that.   The place was crowded but not totally full on a Monday night around 8:30, they use Open Table so I just made a reservation through there. This place has more of a steakhouse feel than some other places in Vegas hotels/casinos. They bring you a side of a couple types of bread and butter which is enjoyable enough. I added a tomato and heart of palm salad which is one of the best salads I've had in a long time. As for the main course, the dry aged bone-in NY strip is their signature and it's a monster at around 18oz. I made a valiant effort but couldn't quite finish it. This is the best steak I've had in quite awhile and the dry aging isn't just hype, you can really taste the difference. As for the sides, the green beans were okay but nothing special so I'd pass on them next time. I was stuffed after my meal but split a slice of good but not amazing cheesecake, it's worth a try if you're wanting dessert.  Service was very friendly and efficient without hovering too much. I really enjoyed my meal and would come back here. Oh, they do the tourist thing where they want to take a picture to sell you, I was stuffing my piehole when she came by and respectfully declined the offer.",

Those in our group that got the turkey dinner were very disappointed. The turkey was rolled turkey and not cut from the actual bird. For the price ($42) it should've been fresh turkey not processed. I ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye because I've been wanting to try a steak there. I asked for medium well and although the majority of what I ate was cooked properly, when I got closer to the bone the rib eye was very undercooked. People who got the turkey dinner also were complaining that some of the food wasn't very hot. And to top it all of we were seated in the most inconvenient table in the restaurant. The table is separate from the rest of the restaurant and is located next to the kitchen. The heat from the kitchen was extremely uncomfortable and good luck if the person on the inside of the booth needs to go to the restroom. Also, because the table is somewhat hidden it felt like our waiter forgot about us. It took about 30 minutes for us to get iced tea and wine. Because we've always had a great experience, we were very disappointed with this one.",

Try \" Gordon Ramsay Steak\". 100 times better. Don't fall for the advertisement.",

Mine was small for the price but had amazing flavor! I ordered it medium and the last piece was definitely rare and left on my plate. Lol  We shared the 4 cheese macaroni, garlic mash, and asparagus. In the other Yelper photos the asparagus looks woody and unappetizing. Looks are deceiving!! It was delicious and tender! Almost seemed like maybe they marinated it prior to cooking? The mac was disappointing... Like dry Velveeta and shells. However the bacon they put in it was smoky and amazing!! Totally saved the dish! The garlic mashed potatoes were more like garlic soup. :/  Staff were polite but not friendly. There's a difference, yes. They didn't offer to box up our leftover sides or his steak. Just cleared the table and brought a dessert menu. We didn't get dessert, but the table next to us did. They looked great! (big!)   Bathrooms are outside the restaurant in the casino, but nice.  This meal was well over $100 and we could have done better at home for half the price. :(",

No. Comfort of the restaurant would get a negative 10 from me for hard wooden chairs with no padding and cold air blowing from the vents in January. I guess common sense is not so common. The server seemed annoyed that my wife amd I were there. The other servers seemed much more friendly. She was very pushy and seemed rushed amd trying to rush us and there were many empty tables in the restaurant for obvious reasons. As far as the food goes, it also was bad. Best part of our meal? Mashed potatos, they were good but not great. I had the signature 28 day dry age new york which was so tough and chewey and flavorless. My wife had the salmon. She liked the salmon except it wasn't cooked all the way through. I saw a manager but at no point did she ever come ask us how things were. It would seem from top to bottom this place just doesn't care. The ambiance is super cheesey too. Tries to come off as high end but it is so not high end. Ive had better steak at outback steakhouse for a fraction of the price with staff that care. Of all the steakhouses in las vegas i would recommend any of the others, it couldn't be worse. Gallaghers seemed they didnt want us there. They are getting what they want, I won't be back and I recommend everyone else save their time and money.",

NY NY is a middle tier casino resort and this is arguably their top product. It's fittingly casual but don't let that fool you, the quality is there.

Great (free) cranberry bread, good soup du jour (jalapeno corn bisque), basic overpriced salads, and flavorless steaks that are so large that you don't even get sides with your \"meal\"--those are a la carte, as if it wasn't expensive enough already.  Do not go here if you want to have a romantic dinner date!  It is so loud that it's barely enjoyable!  We made a reservation ahead of time and even said it was our honeymoon, yet they proceeded to seat us at the noisiest area of the restaurant.

I asked for a certain bottle of wine per arrival....and once arriving I was told it wasn't available anymore. They has a different bottle as an alternate. Fine. Once getting the bill I notice it's a good $25 more than the bottle that I usually order. I ask then about it and (what i assume is the manager) comes over.  He asks me if I was made aware of this by our server. I inform him I don't even know how are server was because we've have at least 4 people serve us. Which is not the norm when we have our usual server serve us. He informs us that hes going to ask the server if she informed us. If she did we would be charged accordingly..if not he would fix it. He finally came back and told us that she had informed us in which we said we would that's impossible. End of story they weren't going to discount us a dollar and we're paying whatever they say because they said so.  I haven't even mentioned that not once did we get our wine refilled.....and we had to wait 1 hour to get our order fulfilled. Worst experience ever. Especially for a anniversary. I never not come here on my visits but this could be the last time I ever come here. I will reach out to the higher above. This was just unacceptable for a $200 meal for 2 people",

Ordered:   surf & turf (filet) for myself , cowboy rib-eye for hubby & side of mushrooms, Pinot Noir.   Positive: rib-eye was delicious and perfectly cooked, mushrooms were flavorful.  Service was spot on & our water glasses were never left empty.  Con: Restaurant was a little loud and the lobster was slightly overcooked and chewy. Filet was good, but nothing to write home about. At close to $100 for the surf & turf I expected better quality & execution. I should have ordered the rib eye which was recommended by other yelp reviewers & our cab driver.   Atmosphere is more relaxed being that it's in the NY NY casino, so we didn't feel out of place wearing jeans and a nice top. However, we did see some older patrons wearing a cocktail dress or slacks and they fit right in too.",

Instead of the swank and haughty vibe that many Vegas restaurants seem to specialize in, Gallagher's is friendly fun.  Dress ranges from slightly casual to casual elegant.    The service was decent (though not outstanding) and the server was able to provide good advice.  Prices are on the high-end but the portions are as large as the steaks in the window, which means, they are TOO large for a single person (even the smaller portioned steak is too large for one person).  The quality of the food is top-notch though Ruth's Chris does better steak.  I'll definitely return when my need for meat finally resurfaces after being much sated by my meal there.",

The bernaise on my NY Sirloin was perfect, and the roasted garlic oozed out and was perfect on my steak. I was so sad that I got too full to finish it. The boys loved their steaks too.

Definitely in my top 5 and maybe even top 3.  The decor is typical steakhouse.  We went early and with reservations so seating wasn't a problem, but the place very quickly packed up.  We were there on a Sunday.  I wanted to come here since last year when me and my boys came for a quick turn around trip and we stayed at New York New York but I got way too wasted and had to crash early.  They never let me live that down but after making sure we hit up this place this year before we got too drunk, the wait was definitely worth it.  We all got New York steaks and it was the only thing we could talk about the rest of the time we were there and can't wait to go back next year.  This steak makes our quick 1 day trip worth the drive.",

Outside of that if you have either a flare gun or road side flares then use them as that apparently is the only way to get service from the wait staff.   One of our group did snag an employee passing by and asked if we could have our sides served to stave of delirium from hunger due to the pro-longed delay. No dice... Instead we got a kid in a suit advising us to not to \"fill up on bread...\" As our waitress shouted problems at him that we had brought up earlier.  Steaks = great Experience = bad Wait staff = terrible Management = Pretentious... & covering for deficiencies!",

    "text": "Very good, traditional NYC steak house - very appropriate in the NYNY Casino.   The interior is dark in a classic steakhouse fashion. The are pictures and caricatures of various old school celebs on the walls. Actually, its a pretty good knockoff of the NYC original. It's also pretty loud - very much like the NYC original. The steaks however, I think are a little BETTER than the NYC original!   The first thing you notice is the meat - it's aging on display right in the front window. Can't miss it. Some may find this distasteful - I find it quite cool. And make no mistake - the steak is what it's all about here. The classic NY Sirloin Strip for about $40 is served on the bone. It's juicy, full of dry aged beef flavor, and just a bit firm to the tooth - note:not tough!- as a good NY Strip should be. And yes, it was aged in the window. The sides aren't as exciting but still very good. The steak fries were huge, crispy, and served with a killer chipotle ketchup. The sauteed spinach was simple yet delicious.   The wine list wasn't the greatest but there was a very nice Merlot served by the glass that went exceptionally well the steak - as a good Merlot should. Oh, service was acceptable.   Is this the best steakhouse in Vegas? Probably not. But it's also a couple of dollars less expensive than the other high end steak places. All in all a good, solid steakhouse. You won't go wrong eating here.",

    "text": "Looking at other reviews and their high opinion of this place, I'd like to first breakdown why my review does not match the other's enthusiasm.  1 star- Service 1 star- Ambience 1 star- Food -1 star- Food (I'll explain)  Let me begin with the service. This is by far the highlight of my meal there. The service was impeccable. WE had a really kind genuine waitress who was consistent in checking on us and spoke to us with purpose and interest. There was a separate guy who filled up waters/drinks, who was seriously on his game that night! He was like a ninja! I'll take a swig of my drink and look over into conversation with my party and look back to notice that my glass was refilled.... *cue eary music* *looks around but not a prospect in sight* haha! But that was awesome, some of the best service I have ever had. Extremely accommodating.  Ambience was nice. The place has their lights low and you look around to a pretty restaurant. It feels like a classy night out, given your cutlery, the service, and the uniform the staff is wearing. But the customers are still casual so that sort of brings things back down to earth, which is fine by me.  Ok here we go, Food! I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye Steak, recommended by the waitress, with a side of macaroni and cheese. Now the steak was really good! (Next time I'll probably go Medium). I really enjoyed the steak but when it came down to complimenting it with a side, there were problems. The macaroni and cheese was bland. They attempted it with different noodles and a creamier white cheese but it lacked flavor and even after adding seasoning it just tasted generic. I tried my friend's french fries and I didn't care for those either, to my surprise! It seems like it would be hard to mess those up. They didn't mess it up but they tried a garlic seasoning or something but it ended up tasting bland. In the end I felt secluded to just the steak which was good but I wanted something else with it. For the money I paid for dinner I feel like my whole dinner should have been amazing. It's pretty pricey here guys so your wallet needs to match your hunger here  If you're just trying to find a great steak and nothing else then this wouldn't be a bad place to try.",

    "text": "Recently I had made reservations for a dinner meeting. The reservations were made well in advance and I even called a few days ahead of time to confirm. When I arrived at the restaurant with my guests they did not have a reservation for me although they did not say this directly to me but you could tell as they were trying to decide what to do. They then escorted my party of 6 to a table less than 4 feet from the kitchen area. Now this was not outside the door to the kitchen but we literally felt we were in the kitchen as there were no walls separating out table from the kitchen. If you could imagine trying to have any type of conversation never mind a business conversation when waiters and waitresses were rushing by, plates clanking, and orders being given to the cooks and orders being picked up by the waiters and waitresses. So now this was the atmosphere. In regard to the food I rate it a 7 on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best.. Not bad but not what I expected for the price atmosphere aside as this did not relate to the quality of the food. I travel to Las Vegas quite frequently on business and there are a lot of high quality restaurants to chose from. I'm sorry to say that based on my experiences this time (my first time to Gallagher's) I would not be coming back. I do hope this review is helpful and I tried to be honest in my report as when you do commit to a dinner in an upscale restaurant cost is not cheap. Will most likely never return based on first impression and experiences.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Gallagher's after reading all the great reviews. I really did.  Unfortunately, our dining experience was less than stellar: - My husband was not served alcohol because he left his ID in our hotel room even though my 60-year-old-plus parents vouched for his age (he's 29). We hadn't been carded the entire trip. I get that they don't want to get in trouble, but this was annoying. - It took about 30 minutes after we sat down to get bread, and we received our entrees ONE HOUR after ordering. We ordered after 8PM on a Sunday night, and they were not swamped with customers. - One of my fellow table guests asked the bread/water server for an update on our food, and he said he'd check with our server. Our server Linda consequently ignored us until our food arrived, about 15 minutes later. We tried to make eye contact with her to no avail while she was checking on other tables around us. - Several dishes were cold when we finally got them (i.e. French fries, which are never good cold). - My husband found several hairs in his food about 10 minutes after we were served. We told our server. She came over and asked if he had saved the hairs for her to see. Who saves hairs they find in their food? That's disgusting! Look on the floor where he tossed them! - The manager came by after our server told him about the hairs on my husband's plate. He too questioned my husband if he saved the hairs (um, no). The manager said, \"I'm surprised, this usually doesn't happen\" - I would certainly hope not! - Neither our server or the manager offered to get another meal for my husband (again, after waiting an hour to get our food, so we were all hungry!). They took his hairy food off the bill, but such an accusatory attitude toward a guest is awful. They were both defensive and arrogant when it came to trying to make the situation better.  Overall, I was extremely disappointed. To wait an hour for food, topped off with rude staff, is unacceptable when you're spending $50+ per person on food and drinks. I work in customer service myself so I know how important it is to cater to your guests. The sad part is, it's Vegas and they don't care if you ever come back, so they could care less about keeping their customers happy.  I emailed Gallagher's customer service (via their website, not New York New York's), so it will be interesting to see if I get a response back.",

    "text": "Our first night in town we decided to dine in the casino we were staying at. A steakhouse immediately got me salivating as I was perusing the often mediocre hotel dining options available to me.  We walked down and were seated quickly. The waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable. Actually I was super impressed with his knowledge of not only the different options, but the intricacies of each. I ordered the fillet mignon  and a side of creamed spinach. My companion ordered the soup of theday (I believe is was cream of tomato or something like that) and a Caesar salad. We also ordered bruschetta as an appitizer.  The bruschetta came out soon enough. It was pretty good but we both thought it was a little too salty and too covered in olive oil. Not a huge disappointment but definitely not that great either.  Our entrees came out shortly after and I was thoroughly impressed. Though a bit pricey, my fillet was super tender and moist. I ordered it medium-rare (as I order all my red meats) and it was cooked perfectly. The creamed spinach was really good as well and definitely went well with the cut of cow in front of me.  Her soup and salad were both satisfying, though the salad was wrapped in large leaves of lettuce that were somewhat difficult to cut-up. After a short, small struggle everything was consumable and delicious.  Overall our meal was great. The service was fantastic and the quality of the food and selection was excellent. Not a five-star steakhouse by any means but far better than I'd ever imagine hotel-dining to be.",

My wife and I love a great steak and after looking at the numerous steakhouses Las Vegas has to offer I settlted on Galleghers based on a reccomendation made by a co-worker. Located inside New York New York this steakhouse is pretty small but well arranged. We had dinner to celebrate our anniversary.   As with many fine steakhouses everything is a la carte, we both decided on the Cowboy Ribeye and I chose (my favorite) sauteed mushrooms, my wife picked mac n cheese as our sides. The mac n cheese was different comes with pieces of bacon so it gave it a  smokey, crunchy touch. I must say the steak was great!! Cooked to perfection, excellent pink center steak comes with a pile of thin onion rings. Now I'm not know for being a light eater but I must say that this cut was a big portion that for the first time in my steakhouse dining experience I didn't finish my steak and doggie bagged it.  My wife was shocked!! She asked if was ok. Lol I said yes I'm just very full. So we skipped dessert and headed back to our room where I had a bottle of my wifes favorite bubbly waiting for us.  So if your ever in Vegas and can't decide on which steakhouse to try walk on over to New York New York and give Galleghers a try.",

    "text": "The steaks at this restaurant are outstanding. They dry age the sirloins for 14 days which \"darkens the color, deepens the flavor, and tenderizes the connective tissue\". Translation: they taste REALLY *REALLY* good.   The restaurant seemed fairly small so if it's a busy night or you like to eat at prime time (like 7:00pm), you might want to get a reservation.   Another thing to note.. Like most nicer restaurants, everything is a la carte. They did provide bread (several kinds). I had a Cesare Salad which was good, but it was served I'm wedge form. It would have been better a little more \"disassembled\".  Two of my party got the New England Clam Chiwder (the white one) and they both fished it quickly and one mopped up the extra with bread.. I'm taking that as a 'yum'.  They have a nice selection of sides, from mushrooms to asparagus to baked or mashed potatoes. The asparagus was steamed but I asked if they would grill it and he accepted with out even thinking about it...  The steaks were awesome. We had two filets and two of the house aged sirloins, and everyone marveled at their steaks.  They were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  They do have other cuts, and chicken and seafood, but where I'm sire they're god, none of us had them.   If you're looking for steak, this is a great alternative to the $50-$60 steak places. You won't be disappointed, or hungry!",

The steaks are huge and since we didn't have a microwave back at our room - there was no point in saving the leftovers. The word delicious doesn't even give justice to this meal. i will definitely return to this place when I go back to Vegas.",

We ordered the asparagus($9), Yukon mashed potatoes($9), French Green Beans ($9), and four cheese mac-n-cheese ($9).

It is the Gallagher's Steakhouse which their NY location has just celebrated their 81 years of operation. We went to have dinner last night and left with a very delicious and happy experience! We started off with one appetizer to share. It was the chilled gazpacho. We both liked it as it is very refreshing to start off a meal. We ordered the house-aged New York Sirloin bone-in weighted 18oz and the 24oz Porterhouse. Both steaks were huge as expected. The steaks were cooked perfectly to our preference of medium rare. It is not easy to cook the big steak to perfection. My sirloin was so thick, but very juicy and packed with flavors. The side Yukon gold potato puree was very velvety smooth. The porterhouse that my husband had was delicious and juicy and tender. They gave you the bone marrow with crostini which is special. The side sauteed green beans were very good and tasted sweet. We finished more than half of the steak and took the rest home. But we still ordered the dessert. If you've been there, you will know how special their dessert menu. The special effect when they opened the menu....not going to say what it is or else it will take away that surprise for readers that have never been there. As recommended by the server, we ordered the toffee pudding. We normally just ok with toffee, but this was very different. A very warm moist toffee cake with toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was just the right sweetness. We ordered coffee with dessert and it came in a silver pot and we both like the coffee to be that hot.  A very good memorable steak dinner for yesterday's special day for both of us!",

We'd been to Ruth's Chris for steak everytime we're in Vegas, and this time he wanted to try something different. Thanks to all those Yelpers out there for helping us decide! I called on a Friday morning to make dinner reservations for that same day, no problem! I do recommend reservations, as there were people being quoted some serious wait times as we walked in. The atmosphere in this place is great. Dimly lit, dark woods and you can even peer into the kitchen from the dining room. Our server was awesome, very attentive without being smothering. We enjoyed some mixed drinks from the bar.. very good! For dinner we both had a wedge salad, shared the mac 'n cheese, I ordered the fillet, he got the strip steak. First of all, I cannot even begin to describe how wonderfully tasty the mac 'n cheese was!!! Gooey goodness of cheese with pieces of bacon mixed in. My mouth is seriously watering just thinking of it. It's a MUST have, so make sure to order it. We both liked our steaks, even though we agree that Ruth's Chris steaks are better.   If I was ranking this place just based on steaks, they'd get 4 stars, but their outstanding service, superb mac 'n cheese, relatively reasonable prices and overall great ambiance boosts this place up to the almighty 5 stars!",

In fact I had to cut away half of what I was served just to get to the actual meat.   I was really unimpressed, a good cut of steak at an expensive restaurant should not be mostly gristle and fat!   Additionally I was less than impressed that the steaks did not include any sort of side whatsoever, and you have to pay extra for a side of potatoes.  The service was pretty good however, which is what is keeping me from giving this a rating of one.",

The service is friendly and attentive, Fernando, Willy and Donna all do a great job of taking care you with a fully stocked bar with a great wine list and various beers and specialty drinks as well. They also have good knowledge of the food menu and the various nightly specials.  The Sirloin and Fillet are my two favs here, along with an order of mushrooms or a stuffed baked potato or maybe one of the wonderful house made soups, try , if you can to save room for one of the desserts you won't be disappointed!  Large portions, great atmosphere, great service and a friendly staff keep me coming back on each visit to Vegas  If you still need to be swayed to try the place, just stand out in front and view the steaks on display in the giant glass case next to the entrance, then go to the front desk and ask for a seat and have a wonderful experience.

    "text": "Gallagher's Steakhouse is located in the New York-New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.   A steakhouse that was highly praised on a few occasions to my boss; we were set to have dinner there Monday night. Seating was quick once the table was ready for our reservation. Staff was nice for the most part.   They recommend their dry aged new york strip and their filet. I asked if she would talk me out of the king cut prime rib. After looking at the menu online before heading to the restaurant, I was excited for the prime rib. It is not an item offered everywhere and I try to get it when the option exists. Unless, of course, she was going to suggest something else. She said she would not talk me out of it, and I ordered it thusly.   I had a terrible piece of meat. It was riddled with fat that the waitress tried to tell me was \"marbling\". Excuse me, I am one of the few steak eaters who actually enjoys the True marbling. This was not the good stuff. She told me I had to get to the center of the steak to find the good part. I had cut all the way through to the center and was still unhappy. I suggested that either I had a very dull steak knife or my steak was a bad cut. She said they did have very dull knives at the restaurant. Yeah, I bet they do. Why would you want sharp steak knives at a steakhouse?   She came back after a few minutes and offered me a small cut of something else if I wanted it but I was too disgusted with my current meal to want any more.   The other entree ordered was the cowboy cut bone-in ribeye (what I should have gotten) and that was said to be good. Not the best, but nothing to complain about.   We had an order of beer-battered onion rings that were very good though they only gave you four on a plate. Their calamari was average and they give you a half a loaf of a sesame bread that was probably the highlight of the meal for me.   As long as I have the choice, I will not go back to Gallagher's.",

The restaurant is located in the New York New York hotel and aside from the meat locker that can be viewed from the \"street\", its a nice restaurant. Not too upscale where people can't afford a meal and still gamble, but still pricey enough and well catered too that you feel like you've been treated.  Being with all our friends really made this experience great, but the staff and food were excellent as well.  I ordered a glass of wine, but for some reason I liked my bf's wine better.  So, my waiter replaced mine with a new glass of the same wine my bf  was drinking...very cool.  I ordered the special, which was salmon  served on a spinach bed and was so tender that the salmon basically melted in my mouth.  I sampled some other people's dishes: lobster, fillet mignon, lamb, and ahi.  All were delicious.  The only thing I didn't like was that you had to pay for all your side dishes, which I hear is standard of a steakhouse, but why?  Somethings I just don't understand, especially when you are paying 30 plus dollars for a dish...what's so bad about having them put a scoop of mashed potatoes on your plate?  Meh! They did bring out 2 birthday desserts for our friend's who were celebrating their birthdays.  Also, it was very close to where we all needed to go to see Zumanity (an awesome show, must see if you are 18 or over, hint hint).  Overall, I had a good meal and had a great time.  Definitely a place to scratch off the list of places to eat in Vegas, not particularly one I'd have chosen but proximity to our show beat out all the other places...oh, and accommodating 14 people in short notice.",

    "text": "Order the cowboy ribeye; your life will be complete.   Went here with a group of 8 after seeing reviews on yelp for a reasonably priced steakhouse in Vegas. $45 a steak isn't bad at all for these parts. Sat by the kitchen which means we saw the meat go into the broiler, coming out perfectly charred - got us excited! Our waiter was great, managing to find humour in our indecisiveness. He recommended a great cab sav at only $55 a bottle (I say only because the lowest price starts at about $45 and goes up to.... well... you don't want to know). We decided to order appy's for the table and paired off to split some prime ribs, NY strip steaks - my BF and I decided to split the Cowboy ribeye (our waiter's recommendation and favorite steak).   The crab cakes were awesome; the scallops were gigantic and cooked perfectly. The clam chowder was a bit too salty for our taste  - everyone at the table had a bowl.  Then the highlight, the steaks. We were given an additional complimentary prime rib, courtesy of the chef! Each one was perfectly cooked except for one NY Steak was medium instead of medium rare - but no matter because we couldn't even finish every plate (we did wonder if the comped prime rib was because of the overcooked NYsteak...).  The crown jewel, our Cowboy ribeye. Oh my god, i was so happy we went with this. It has the tenderness and fattiness of the prime rib, but the charred and tastiness of the NY strip. I was so full but just couldn't let even one bit go to waste.   One steak is definitely enough to share between two people if you're having appies and soups like us. We left with a full stomach and a smile fueled by gluttony on our faces. Definitely will be back next time we're in town.",

While their bartender was slightly annoying (Fernando telling us how great California is), the food speaks for itself.  I had a large cut of Filet Mignon and an enormous Australian Lobster Tail.  It was cooked to perfection and ranks up there on my all-time best meals.  Sides were very good as well (Roasted asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes).

My boyfriend and I were on our Babymoon, and decided to give this Steakhouse a shot and we were delighted by not only the attentive service but quality of food. I had the chicken dish and he had cowboy rib eye, both plates were great but the rib eye was absolutely amazing, very tasty!!! Highly recommend it, its not easy to find a great steakhouse these days. We will be back, once the baby arrives that is. :)",

What made our experience horrible was that initially the Waiter started off well and friendly. After he took our order he was non existent, which is sad since I wanted to order another cocktail and asked the busser if I could order the cocktail he told me he would let my waiter know, instead it was never ordered. The waiter he only showed up after we finished our meal to take our desert order. WTF? Will never go here again unless it was comped.",

She's one of those who only eats meat when its charred.... Her husband had the Prime Rib Queen Cut and it was unbelievably big. Despite its size he nearly finished it. I don't think he ever ate a steak that big before, but he told us because its so good he made an exception!  I would come back to Gallaghers over Mastro's. I also tried Carnevino and this steakhouse is still top of the list!",

Heaven on 2 plates & the wedge salad was probably one of the best I've ever had! Usually I would've ordered an appetizer to start, like the clams or calamari, but trust me, portions are decent & filling here; just go for a meal & a salad, because they provide a bread basket as a \"starter\" & everyone knows bread is a filler starch.   Staff was great, our server was so nice & he did a good job of checking in on us without being overbearing about it. There was a lady going around to each table with a big camera offering to take pictures- man, they definitely know how to milk you in Vegas with add-on's & upsells, but we declined (partly because I can't stand cameras with HUGE flashes like hers had).

I am a HUGE believer in providing outstanding customer service especially when it is YOUR job and you get paid to do it. These people here, go above and beyond. They know their job and do it very, very well.  I went to Gallagher's for a work dinner and we were lucky enough to be greeted (once we arrivede at our table) by the Executive Chef. He hand picked a couple of our appetizers for us and made us feel completely at home.  We were served the cold and hot seafood appetizers and almost everything on these two dishes were spectacular. Everything except the fried calamari. It was a bit greasy, a tad bit over cooked and the breading didn't want to stay on. Still good needless to say. The jumbo colossal shrimp on both plates were to die for. On the hot platter it was drizzled in the most amazing sauce. Shrimps on both platter were so sweet and succulent. Crab cakes on the hot platter were the perfect size and the crab legs on the cold platter were split, easy to eat and so very sweet.  We also had bruschetta which was neither here nor there for me. It was fine but didn't blow me away or anything.   I absolutely loved my porterhouse steak and while I love my beef, most yell at me when I order mine medium well. Pink is good with no blood for me please. But even though I had it cooked a little longer than medium rare it was still tender and juicy. One thing I was extremely shocked was how well seasoned the meat was. I didn't taste nothing more than salt and pepper but it was just perfect. Enough seasoning to compliment the meat and not cover the flavor of the steak itself.  The bone marrow that comes with the porterhouse was a HUGE surprise to me and a good one at that. I was drooling when I was eating it and enjoying every minute of it. I had only wished I had more. It was that good.   The asparagus here have the most perfect Hollandaise sauce I have ever tasted in my life. The sauce was bright with lemon, buttery, smooth and the way it coated my tongue left me in heaven.   We also had a mac and cheese but it was overpowered by the bacon in it and I wasn't a huge fan.  The Yukon gold potato puree was good, not great. A bit too loose for me but all the cheese that was in made up for it.  Decent wine list. Strong mixed drinks.   Expensive dinner to say the least. But I didn't have to pay for it. ;)",

To be fair, his prime rib put the largest serving at House of Prime Rib in San Francisco to shame, dwarfing the plate it arrived on. Our server started us off with seriously delicious cranberry walnut bread and a fluffy standard house loaf. The butter came room-temperature and lightly whipped, perfect for spreading.   My filet mignon was tender and flavorful. As our server warned, the middle was a bit more rare than I usually expect for med-rare. I finished it easily without an additional sauce, but enjoyed a few pieces with the horseradish offerings that W requested with his prime rib. Notably, there were a few cuts that were sinewy and difficult to hack through with my knife, which was a bit dull.   For the price of our cuts, I was surprised at how sparse they arrived. Our server recommended selecting 2-3 sides to share between the four of us. Thank goodness we did, because the filet mignon only came with a fried cassava/taro/? chip and some peppery mach lettuce. French green beans were garlicky and crisp, and mushrooms were cheesy and rich.   Seated across from the kitchen, we could see that the bruschetta was an understandably popular appetizer. The diced tomato glistened like small jewels from the baguette slices on the counter.   S polished the cowboy ribeye neatly, but there were quite a few pieces of fat that he cut away and left behind. Plenty of fried onion strings to share!",

The prices were a bit steep, but that's to be expected at a steakhouse in Vegas. The side dishes were really small (think 5 pieces of asparagus on a plate), so order accordingly.

I ordered the signature dry-aged New York. When I say it's the best steak I've ever had I truly mean it. Better than Mastro's. Ordered it medium rare and it was absolutely perfect. Got the garlic three cheese mashed potatoes on the side and they were amazing as well. Yes it's expensive, but it's totally worth it. I will eat here every time I come to Vegas in the future.",

We ordered the chicken ceasar salad along with some bread for appetizers. The bread was fresh and soft. For entrees we ordered the salmon and steak. It was so delicious. For dessert we got the vanilla ice cream with cookie.  The food was so delicious and unless I am blown away by it, I would normally give this place 4 stars. I rarely give 5 stars to restaurants unless well deserved. Gallagher's deserved it. I gave them a full 5 stars because not only was the food amazing but the service was too. Our waiter was personable, memorable and friendly. Top notch.",

While my parents and I were hanging out in the New York New York enjoying the piano bar, walking around waiting to see a show we stumbled across this place and had to eat here! They were very accommodating. We were able to make reservations right then and there for when we got out of our show that night.  Everything was awesome from the time we sat till the time we left. We shared clams casino as an app.   My father and I each ordered a dry-age 14oz NY strip steak and a 3lb main lobster! And my dads lady had a dry-age filet with a Australian lobster tail. Soooooo yummy. They even de-shell your lobster at the table for you so you don't have to get all messy cracking shells! Apparently the chef didn't like the looks of my lobster tail so they brought me another whole 3lb lobster! Eating like a queen! I ended up have left overs and had a great breakfast the next day! Their bread is pretty good too, I loved the wheat with raisins in it. We didn't order any sides because who needs sides to fill up on when you have a plate full of steak and lobster to get threw!   If your not looking to spend any where from $60 to $140 a plate then don't stop here. But it's well worth the $140 we paid per plate for just steak and lobster! I'll be back if I'm ever back in Vegas or NYC!",

My wife got the queen size prime rib cut and i ordered the rib eye.  Both were satisfactory.  Starting off with my wife's prime rib.  It was soft, tender, lots of juice, buttery, i mean its so perfect.  As far as for Rib Eye, its not as good as the first time.  But it always has the char grilled favor, which really grabs the attention.  My cut wasn't too bad, but it has some party requires extra work to chew.  I have to recommend their crab cakes to anyone who goes there.  Their crab cakes are make from real ALASKAN KING CRAB meat.  I think it really worth the money.  Anyways i would recommend anyone to give it shot.",

My friends had:  shrimp cocktail, surf and turf, cowboy cut steak (i think that's what it's called, all i know is it's EXPENSIVE), oysters, and they all said it was the most delicious food they've ever eaten.    a great place to eat, definitely pricey, but one of those places you should eat at when you're on vacation because dammit, you deserve it.    side note, our waiter was really, really awesome, i wish i could remember his name.

This booth is totally secluded from the rest of the restaurant and we got to watch the chefs prep the meals. Pretty amazing if you're a foodie.  The waiter was nothing but excellent and everyone was very helpful. The staff is knowledgeable about what they serve and where it is from. The chef even visited our table on multiple occasion to offer free food to taste. I assumed it would be either added to our tab (no big deal) or the portions would be taster size. But no, the portions were regular size and should I say delicious. I rarely feel like the service is outstanding, but this was epic. That's what I want when I go into a restaurant, the feeling that you are just as important as the millionaire or the rich asshole at the next table. If I could give this place a 10 I would.

I really didn't know where to start but some folks recommended Yelp. After a few days of searching on Yelp, I decided on the Gallagher's Steakhouse in The New York New York Hotel.   I was able to reserve last minute for a group of 12 drunks..um guys without a problem. Even the day of, we showed up fairly late but we were seated without issue. Hell, we were escorted to the back room by a cutie pie Pinay girl (Neato!).   I ordered the aged beef sirloin, medium rare. I was able to try the same steak rare; both are an experience. My personal fav was the side of mac n' cheese; maybe the best \"bar none\". The prices are astronomical but you do get what you pay for. Thanks to Yelp I was able to make an educated decision. To this second, all of my guests rave about the food. Cheers Yelp!",

The two other things that really stood out for me were the service and the broccoli au gratin.  The broccoli was decadent and a wonderful companion to a rich steak.",

Our server, Aris, was awesome and the rest of the people that helped him were extremely nice and courteous. The food was AMAZING and the price of the dry-aged steak could not compare to how huge the portion was. I couldn't even finish it and had to bring it back to the hotel. My husband then ordered tea at the end of his meal, while the rest of us ordered coffee. The server brought out a box with multiple choices of tea. The dessert was amazing, although I forgot what it was called. At first we ordered, one dessert, but it was soooo good that we had to order two additional servings. A must when coming to Vegas, next year again!!! Mahalo Aris!!!!",

We said ok, but at that same moment, four seats magically opened at the bar. We all sat down, and ordered Manhattans and four medium-rare bone-in ribeyes (as one does at a steakhouse). Our female bartender was attentive and friendly, even though the bar was packed. Would come back to see her again. The steaks were all tasty (but only two were medium-rare...the other two substantially over), as were our sides. Not cheap, but certainly not overpriced, and the cocktails were strong and well-made. This was my second time at Gallagher's, and I'm looking forward to going back my next time in Vegas.",

The second star is because it's entirely possible that my experience was just bad luck based on the other reviews.",

    "text": "Quite literally the best steak I ever had.  Very nicely turned out restaurant, helpful yet unobtrusive staff, unbelieveable food.  First, let's get the one downer for this place out of the way... it's expensive.  Really good steak places are.  If that's a problem, you won't like it.  Once you get over that, be prepared to just sit there and groan for at least a half hour after you eat here.  The steaks are just that big and that good.   I'd recommend either the dry-aged New York strip (with bone, and about 2+ inches thick, plus look up dry-aging... it's incredible), or the Cowboy-cut Rib-eye (best rib-eye... EVAH, and at least a pound of beef).  Sides are also pretty nice.  We had the broccoli au gratin, wild mushrooms, asparagus, and mashed potatoes (can be skipped) at the table.  They were big enough for 2 easy and very tasty.  The staff was great.  At places this nice, the staff are sometimes just too eager to pump the tip and are constantly interrupting your conversations and groans of enjoyment.  Not True here.   Our glasses were never empty, but I hardly noticed the staff after we got our meal, otherwise.  Good job, guys.  The six of us spent about $450 with a few beers and sodas around the table, 6 steaks, and 4 or 5 sides.  It's not cheap, but if you're in Vegas for some good food... this is a great place to get it.  Oh, forget dessert, it's a joke you'll understand after you've stuffed the steak in your belly.",

They insisted that our experience that night was not typical and asked that we revisit the restaurant after they addressed issues with the staff.   We returned last night and were, if course, hyper aware to the issues we saw in June.  We wanted a good bottle of wine and our questions were a little outside of the expertise of our waitress. The  sommelier was very patient and when given our price range recommended a bottle at the low end of our range. He was spot-on with the wine.   A large party was seated next to us and service did not suffer in the least. All in all this was the kind of great service we expect when visiting a nice restaurant. Let's just chalk the June visit up as a bad night that was the exception rather than the rule.   Service was great and the food is exceptional. We'll be back.",

Have been there several times over the years when we have a taste for good beef.  They  know how to  cook it right.  Sides were good but ordinary we had Yukon gold mashed and salted French beans.

For my entree I had the filet mignon with Bearnaise sauce.  SO GOOD!  This place is definitely on par for awesome steak with other fantastic steak houses.    For sides, I had the mac and cheese and asparagus.  The mac and cheese was actually not that great.  The only semi disappointing thing about the night really.  It wasn't bad but at fine restaurants the mac and cheese is usually to die for and theirs was just OK.  Asparagus was great.  The highlight of the night though was probably the service.  Our waiter's name was Paul and he was just fantastic!  So funny, so easy going, great service.  Overall - seriously a great place, I would definitely recommend to everyone.",

You could cut the tension with a ... knife (yes that is terrible I know).  Tempted by the dry aged but I decided on the prime rib.  The meal was large enough to split easily. I can put down about 5 plates at the bellagio buffet if you need a reference for the steak size. The cut was around 3 inches thick no joke. Perfectly cooked and possibly the best prime rib I have had but I have not been to Lawrys.  The atmosphere was fitting for a steakhouse with good lighting, not too dark.  Informative servers.  Everything is a la carte including sauces for the meat at around $3 per and the meats were around $35 to $50.",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about the dry aged steak and wanted to try one so thought this would be the place as the advertise their dry aged steaks by hanging them in the window.  After talking to the staff I decided to go with flavor and their recommended ribeye steak.  This is my favorite cut which I have had before in other restaurants.  I did not order any sides which are all separately priced as I know the steak should be more than enough.  The steak was delivered and was cooked medium and was hot throughout and pink in the middle.  Sound just right.  While the first bites were delicious, it became tougher and tougher as well as less juicy.  Other rib eyes I've had have been a little thinner cut but much tastier and of better quality. The service was very prompt and you might expect from a high-end steakhouse with the water glass being filled frequently. The dark wood make you feel as though you were in an English manor and add to the experience but doesn't over come the lack of quality meat.",

With aged steaks displayed in the front, it was hook, line and sinker for my husband!  We had arrived a few minutes early for our reservation but they seated us right away.  One of the gentlemen assisting the waitstaff immediately filled our water glasses as we glanced at our menu choices.   John was our waiter for the evening.  He was spot on for our special night!  They kept our drinks filled and they all were so polite and friendly.    We started with the clam chowder soup.  This was so creamy and delightful! And the serving was more than enough to satisfy my taste buds.   It was almost enough soup to fill my stomach before our entrees were delivered.  I would get this again for sure!  Our entrees were brought out shortly thereafter.  I went with the shrimp and grits.  LOVE IT!  The shrimp was grilled perfect with a light seasoning.  The grits were so creamy with a delicious cheese blend. This entree didn't stand a chance against me!  I finished it like a champ!   My husband, of course, went with the dry aged sirloin he saw in the display. Yes. Yes. and Yes again!  Medium rare is the way we love our steaks.  The chef prepared this perfectly!  Plus this steak was absolutely huge!  We agreed to split the steak next time we dined here.  I know you pay a little more than usual for their steaks here but I feel like you get what you pay for.    This was a perfect meal at an exquisite restaurant.  I would recommend this to anyone! AND WE WILL BE BACK!",

It's all about the quality and precision. You show up to a steak house specializing in dry aged beef and order a salmon plate? Get out of the van, Jan!   Hell no, the specialty is the New York strip steak--order it and be amazed. Be advised each menu item is ala cart therefore the 46.00 steak is NOT accompanied with a side and salad for free. You will spend another 20 bucks for a veg and green salad.   The food is amazing, even the wedge salad was well planned and tasty. Every detail is appreciated in the establishment. Our server named Sam was more of a father figure, Gambino crime boss than a waiter. His service was very appreciated and useful.   I have never spent a solid 50.00 on a steak and only a steak. I will gladly return every time I'm in Vegas. It was that good.",

The entire staff, including the hostess, food runner, and busser, were all very accommodating and polite.  Girlfriend ordered the Dry-Aged New York Strip and I ordered the Cowboy Rib-Eye. If there's one thing for you to take away from my review, it is that both of these meat cuts are HUGE! I ate about half of the Rib-Eye, and my girlfriend barely dented the New York Strip. Both steaks were cooked very well and had all the qualities of a good steak (juicy, flavorful, tender, etc.). Unless you come here with a gigantic appetite, I would recommend you and your partner to split one of these steaks, because they are big. I think our waiter told us the NY Strip was 16oz.  Highly recommend this spot to anyone on the south end of the strip looking for a good steak.",

I had a reservation for 5:30 and was promptly seated in a mostly empty restaurant.  The waiter was soon at the table with ice water and to take a drink order quickly.  After finding out the weights of the various steaks. I didn't want 18+ ounces in a steak so I ordered their \"signature house-aged bone in sirloin.\"  I ordered it cooked blue.  I also ordered a side of the Special Spud.  Last night, it was mashed potatoes with jalapeno pieces, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese.  For dessert I got the Sticky toffee pudding.  I was brought a nice bread basket with two types of bread and some whipped butter.  The server brought my iced tea and it was kept filled throughout the time I was there.  The steak came and it was done exactly the way I like it--nice grill marks on the outside and cold, red on the inside.  It was a good steak.  The Special Spud was very good, probably the highlight of the evening which isn't necessarily a good thing when a side is what you remember your dinner for.  The sticky toffee pudding was good, also.  It came with some whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Service was attentive and pleasant from the time I was greeted at the door to leaving. My server was Bobby and he was a very pleasant gentleman.  I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and it got to be fun when some more people came in and I could overhear the tourist talk going on.  A solid steakhouse but it's not in my top tier of Las Vegas steakhouses.  Note:  For those on vacation, they have a photographer come around and take photos so you can remember that special dinner in Las Vegas.  I enjoyed seeing the couple two tables down from me look at the finished photos and purchase one to take home.",

Followed up with the New York Sirloin that was about 10 oz if i dont remember wrong. It had a great charred crust and still perfectly medium rare pinkish inside. It was melt in your mouth good and Went perfect it the Classic bearnaise. The small Ceasar as a side was delicious and the dressing was one of the better Ceasar dressings i have had for a while.   Prices are as expected a Little bit higher here but its still a solid pick if you are craving a nice piece of meat on the strip.",

The cranberry bread had a good idea behind it but end of day it was cold. We both ordered wedge salads. The wedge salad was flat and uninspired. The lettuce yellow and the blue cheese dressing watery. Fast forward to dinner I ordered the filet mignon & she ordered the rib eye steak. We ordered macaroni & cheese with asparagus for sides..   The filet mignon was just beautiful. It was tasty and cooked to perfection. In fact the filet mignon & our sodas is why I am giving this steakhouse two stars..   The rib eye on the other hand was just an atrocity. The first rib eye was remarkably overcooked and rubbery. We then we waited another 15 minutes for another rib eye that was still tough. The manager brought the new rib eye personally and apologized but the steak was still a let down. We both tried a cut. It was tough. The macaroni and cheese was undercooked. The noodles in particular were hard. The asparagus had a slightly bitter taste. We added in two sodas and the bill was $170. I never mind to spend hard earned money on great food but this experience was mediocre at best. This was just not worth the time or effort.. Unless only ordering a filet mignon & soda.",

In fact, make no bones about it I ate my whole portion which was more than my brothers. If I'm gonna cheat on my pegan diet for a special occasion like this I will savor every last bite.

He knew his menu very well. We both ordered the filet mignon. I got the potatoe puree and my boyfriend got a loaded twice baked potatoe. We ordered a side is asparagus to split. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and was maybe the best steak I've ever had. The asparagus was very tender. All was very good. I got keylime pie for dessert. Very tasty!

It's a little dated on the inside but still has the classic steakhouse feel .   We didn't have a reso but still got sat within a couple minutes in a pretty busy restaurant .  The service was just ok for a alacarte steakhouse . The server didn't offer specials or explain the menu at all just waited for us to order . Throughout dinner we had to wave him or a assistant over for service .   The food was pretty good though . I had the shellfish platter for 1 which was perfect for me not too much but enough to enjoy . My girlfriend ordered the wedge salad which was on the bottom tier of restaurants wedge salads. We ordered the bone in dry aged strip and The steak was pretty damn good . Mouth watering and a little fatty cooked perfectly medium rare and juicy .  The steak made the dinner for sure and it's all we talked about post dinner . The sides were good as well . The Mac and cheese and steamed spinach were standard fare.   Overalls as an ok experience with a great steak . Probably won't be back but will have to find a dry aged steak somewhere else.",

    "text": "Gallagher's holds a special place in my heart because I have dined here numerous times with my husband,  usually in celebration of a special occasion.  Situated on a \"street corner\" inside the NYNY, a few steps from the casino floor, this establishment is based on a restaurant of the same name in NYC.  There is a bar that you can sit at either inside or outside, and that is where we sat on our most recent visit.  Previously, we have eaten inside, and it is classy joint.  There is a usually a hostess dressed in black who will escort you to  your table.  After being seated, you will meet one of the most professional waiters or waitresses ever and he or she will be your guide to all things Gallagher.  The service here is pretty impeccable and you will realize, as we have, that the individuals who work here are dedicated to providing a quality dining experience.  I have only tried their signature steak and the salmon (just once on this last visit).  The salmon was good, but I am still kicking myself for wasting a Gallagher's visit and not having a steak.  It is the best I have ever had there.  Sides are always great as well.  Personally, I like the asparagus and the cheesy mashed potatoes.  I usually lead with an heirloom tomato and hearts of palm salad, which is a great mix of flavors and textures.  I've also had the shrimp and grits just once, and it was awesome.  Sitting at the exterior bar, we still had great service and food without the frills of fancy dining.    I definitely see myself visiting Gallagher's in the future with my awesome husband and maybe some friends or family.  If you are considering it, definitely try it out.",

My family got the steak which costed a small fortune and the bill would baffle anyone. I mean I would call it fine dining and breathing but if you are anything like Mr. Krabs this would put a dent in your wallet. Overall really good food but prepare to put a second mortgage on your house after you eat here.",

We wanted a great steak and were referred to Gallagher's in New York, New York by multiple people in the area.  We made a reservation earlier in the day and indicated we would like the opportunity to sit together.  When we arrived, the place was packed and we did not especially like where they seated us.  Without issue, a manager relocated us to a booth where we could sit together comfortably.  Shortly thereafter, we were greeted with champagne.  All of the wait staff was extremely pleasant and attentive.  Management helped the staff bus tables, deliver food and overall jumped in wherever needed to help.  The food was delicious as well.",

We started with shrimp scampi, clam chowder and a wedge salad. The shrimp scampi ($18.00) was prepared with a tomato cream sauce and was very good. The clam chowder ($8.00) was made with a heavy hand of bacon. The bacon choked out the flavor of clams. The salad ($9.00) was fresh, cold and delicious.   For entrees we took the advice of our waiter and ordered the cowboy ribeye. ($47.00) It does not come with sides so we added creamed spinach ($9.00) and a baked potato. ($9.00) The ribeye was cooked perfectly and looked mouthwatering good. The compliments stop there because the steak was really tough and bland....a huge disappointment. The baked potato was good but the creamed spinach was not seasoned properly and had a distinct taste of flour.",

Sand in your toes cocktail was delicious and well priced at $10. Hostesses were poorly trained. Empty restaurant at 5pm and they sat us all at the same wall of table/booth (shared booth seats across a wall- that moved every time someone got up). Service was ok. My steak plate was really, really hot, which means it sat under a lamp in the kitchen, and it tasted like it. The outside was very dry. The \"Italian\" bread was also stale. It was obviously pre-cut and left out.  It's a lazy Vegas restaurant that should be much, much better.",

Our server was decent but it's obvious that the service assistants (whatever they call them here) are the ones who do all the work. We never had a low glass of water, empty bread basket or crumb on the table.  Unfortunately, the main reason to go to Gallagher's is the steaks and our were disappointing. I got the center cut filet, husband got the porterhouse, both ordered medium. Mine was way overdone, not so much as a line of pink. His was RARE, I mean really rare. It was like they threw them on the fire at the same time and removed them together.  Bad part is husband is just learning to like steak medium, he was raised in a \"well done\" home (I know, blasphemy) so this was too much for him. We didn't send it back, it was late so we traded steaks. Unfortunately I ordered the Oscar accompaniment, which could've used a little more bearnaise to be honest, so he got that when we switched.  We won't be back. There are too many great steak houses in Vegas to spend $300 and get the temperatures wrong on all the steaks in the order.",

The menu has changed. They changed the scallops. Arguably to die for, amazing, as an appetizer. Now, they changed it to an entree and is no longer the same dish, however they hiked up the price for the same amount of scallops.   The salmon is no longer their signature salmon.  Now it comes with lentils instead of quinoa. For real?  The waitress said they gave a new chef that changed things.   Honestly in my opinion, I would change things back.  The lentils were good but it devalued the whole dish entirely. It looked messy, and took away from the finesse of the whole dish entirely.   We ordered dessert and the size of their sticky toffee pudding is much smaller for the same price.   Such a shame. My family and I frequently come here, but these changes sucked.   Please go back to the original menu!!",

My group of four was quickly seated in a quickly filling dining room after we arrived for our dinner reservation, and I immediately went to work sampling attractive menu offerings.    A Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail sported excellent meaty shrimp accompanied by a zesty horseradish-based sauce.  Next was an equally tasty Spinach Salad with Warm Bacon Dressing that contained large chunks of bacon and Red Grapes.  Paired with the salad was a complimentary Bread Basket that held a Baguette, Olive Bread, and Sourdough Ciabatta that was just sour enough.    Next up for me was a Center Cut Filet Mignon with Wild Mushroom Sauce, Brandy Peppercorn Sauce, and Bearnaise Sauce along with a Colossal Baked Potato that was truly huge in size. and enhanced by add-ons of bacon and chives, while Diane enjoyed bacon and cheddar cheese with her giant spud.  The potato was cooked perfectly, and my 8 oz. steak was buttery, flavorful, and perfectly medium rare.  All of the sauces went very well  with the meat.   I left no leftovers on my plate.  But Diane could not finish her 14 oz. New York Strip.  When it was boxed, the remaining Sourdough Ciabatta went with it!.    The food here was expensive but worth it.  Surf & Turf was running $125.  Service was very good, and caring.  And the ambiance deep in the bowels of New York New York was that of a clubby classic steakhouse.",

Only reason why not a 5 star review was due to the small portions compared to what you pay, and the glass they served my Macallan 12 year old whiskey was pretty dirty.   I was close to sending it back, but couldn't bring myself to be a borderline \"dinning snob\".  Since I had a nice ribeye steak the previous nite, I decided to try out their rack of lamb cooked med rare... as if there was another way to prepare it.    Whatever the spices used to prepare the dish, it totally made the lamb explode in your mouth.   The sides were good, but the bread pudding we had for desert was a let down.  The wife had their filet, and we added the lobster tail on our cuz's dish.  You be the judge... worth the price?  Or worth paying for the ambiance?",

Once seated in had alerted the server that we are in a slight time crunch because we were going to go see kaskade after dinner. And he was understanding and got right to our order so we can leave on time. We got crab cakes for an appetizer to start and my hubby got the dry aged steak (and with bernaise sauce) with an Australian lobster tail, and I got the rack of roasted lamb and we were going to share a side of mash potatoes.   The food was cooked perfectly, my lamb was extremely tender and practically falling off the bone, and my hubby loved his meal as well the only down side for him was he asked if he could get the main lobster tail instead of the Australian lobster tail but they couldn't do that. And personally we just prefer the Maine lobster because it's sweeter and more succulent. You must get the bernaise sauce if you get the steak, it takes the steak to a completely different level, it makes it so much better. The crab cakes was great and so was the mash potatoes.   Our dinner was very delicious and we'll definitely be back the next time we're in vegas.",

    "text": "Located in NEW YORK NEW YORK hotel/casino --- Very cool fridge display of the ageing meat just right at the entrance into this restaurant. You can tell they really have pride in ageing their meat to perfection.  Seating was quick and pleasant. Atmosphere was nice and quaint. We did not need reservations as it was a weekday on low season for Vegas. My husband and I enjoyed our meal and price was ok. You can't complain for the type of steaks your getting. If your not willing to fork out and spend then don't eat here. But if your looking for quality steak and cooked just to your liking, I highly recommend trying this place out.  I liked the fact that you can't smell the stinky smoke flowing into your area and dampening your dinner meal.  That was a plus because i'm so allergic to the smell of smoke which is what bothered me a lot through the casino floors.   I don't have anything negative to say about this restaurant other then that the service could have been a bit more attentive. I needed some water and had to look for a waiter several times before I got my water filled. I'm pregnant so I couldn't have any wine therefore my husband was nice enough not to let me watch him enjoy a glass of wine while i sipped on my water. He had water as well.",

    "text": "First off, I'd like to say I'm not a steak person at all. With that being said, the filet mignon I ordered here was so perfectly seasoned and cooked medium rare like I asked and SO tender - divine! I now think that the steak I have tasted at other restaurants has been either over- and under-seasoned and usually too oily for my liking. Green beans as my side was simple, really nothing to rave about and in my opinion, should have been included with our steaks. Dining partner ordered the dry aged strip which he raved about; when I tried a piece, it was extremely flavorful but almost a bit on the salty side for me. It could be due to the dry aged flavor, it has an umami taste to it. I do have to say his dish was HUGE, a gigantic steak which he somehow miraculously finished.  Note: As I stated, this place charges separate for the sides, an order of steak is simply just a steak! I would think it is standard to have a side of vegetable or carb come with a steak at this price point.  Overall I would say this place is very good and has a very intimate date vibe with excellent steaks. Worth the try for a steak connoisseur but the prices really do add up quickly.",

    "text": "I'm sad to have to write this review, Gallagher's had been our go to place for great steaks and excellent service for several years,but this last visit  was horrendous. Immediately I noticed the service was lacking, I've been there when the place was packed and still received excellent service. This night was not super busy, and it took out server,Todd, at least 20 minutes to even step over to the table. Every time he came over, which weren't many, he spoke to us while running past the table. He clearly was not interested in hearing how our food was tasting or whether or not we needed anything else. I ordered the cowboy sirloin and my date ordered the  filet mignon, we ordered sliced mozzarella and tomatoes as an appetizer and asparagus as our side. The steaks were completely dry and lacked any flavor at all! She didn't even get down one bite and I added butter to mine from the table and ate mine( I was starving and figured i may as well try to get it down). The asparagus was too oily and had a weird fishy after taste. The only good thing about the meal was the appetizer. Sad to say, I will not be returning to Gallagher's. I went ahead and paid the $130 for my meal, left a tip, not as much as I normally would but far more than Todd deserved, and went away feeling disappointed. I've recommended this place to so many friends, family and colleagues but I'll have to update them on this recent visit. I guess all good things come to an end.",

Yummy lol The reason I gave it 4 starst is because even though our server was sweet & friendly I feel like we were dealing more with our busser then the actual server .

    "text": "This place is OK overall.  Trusted Yelp to find a good steak place for my friends birthday in Vegas without breaking the bank so we made a reservation here. Although we made reservations in advance, we were sat at the kitchen. For a place that is as snobby as the staff were, I was surprised that they even had kitchen seating? I don't mind a nice personal view into the kitchen but this kitchen was a bit noisy and carefree on the fact that customers were placed there. So the ambiance of this place was not very impressive.  The food: They had the bone in filet as their special but they didn't work too much on giving it a good price to convince me that I wanted a meal that was preselected in sides and seasoning. I could build my own filet with double the seasonings for cheaper so I did that instead. My friends had bone in NY Steaks and another filet with king crab oscar. The best meal was the king crab oscar filet. It did add a twist to the meat that brought out a different flavor to the entire meal. I have to agree with our waiter and state that it should always be served this way. As for my meal, I tried the peppercorn and onions. It was meh overall. The steak, of course, was good but only because it was a filet. The meat is already what it was and it being Gallagher's didn't add anything special to it so i will not give credit to the restaurant in this case. Overall, I would say it was a 4 star quality if it was based on the food itself.  Price: it was about average to be expected for a steakhouse. It was not obscene but it was not cheap. The perception of price is used in this establishment. An old marketing trick to assure that the hit to the wallet isn't visually grandiose; all items are a la carte. So you buy the items piece by piece. I enjoy the \"option\" feeling but don't think it's a fair trade value for those options in this case.  Service: Now this is where the stars fall off. Did you think I rated it poorly because I snobbishly didn't want to sit in the kitchen? oh no, I enjoy lots of different experiences and would have flipped a story to make the birthday girl happy sitting there as if we exclusively saw what goes on back stage. No, the service was extremely poor (overall). It started good actually, The reception were very professional, clean, and helpful. Loved it! The waiter was friendly and showed a lot of effort. He came by and spoke to us, explained meals, specials, and drinks. As the night progressed, we saw less and less of him as well as not be able to ask anyone else for assistance. We started to wait for drink orders for over 15 minutes with no one in sight. So, about an hour in after ordering our meal, I flagged down some person with a suit that was headed to the kitchen. I only assumed because of the direction he was going...I mean, everyone else had a name tag and after I had flagged him down, I realized. . oh! he had no name tag. So I asked..sorry, do you work here? (perhaps a manager since he has no name?) His response rudely was, \"Of course!\" with a duh attitude. I wanted to explain to him that he didn't fit the normal uniform and I didn't notice that he had no name tag. And at an upscale dining establishment. . . finding a man in a suit is rather common. I had a vest on myself and just a coat away from dressing better than him. But I shrugged it off as I didn't want to hold him back from where he was going.  I inquired about our meal since at this rate of just waiting without any sign of our waiter, it may be another hour before we get to eat and will miss our show. I made the reservation for 7pm and had a 9:30pm show. We were hoping to grab a drink before it but spoiler alert, we finished dining at 9:20pm and had no time to look around the hotel. He then proceeded to look down his nose to me and say that this was a True Italian dining experience and that I should have known this before booking this restaurant before the show. My issue here is that he started scolding me without even knowing the context of the situation or even talking with our waiter. This bothered me a lot. Is it True Italian style to wait for your drink for 20 minutes before they arrive? I think some Italians would disagree. I know I would get sober enough not to want another by then personally. i highly doubt our case was based on the theme of this establishment. I could rant on about more after this but this was the main story experience of this place. It's Vegas. Many choices and great options to partake on.  Go elsewhere. I truly don't recommend this place. I regret not just going to StripSteak at the Mandalay but I wanted to try something new.   perhaps the real Gallagher's in Real NY is better? I'm not sure. I surely don't want to find out when I'm in the area. I'll try other places as well.",

Anyway, they have dry-aged and dry/wet-aged steak, the New York steak is the only one just dry-aged. I ordered the New York steak, creamed spinach and Mac and cheese. Honestly instead of tasting creamy , it had a chalky taste to it.  The left over steak I had actually tasted so much better the next day. The waitress came by and checked on us before our food came, after that she disappeared and we had to ask another waiter to find her so we could pay the bill and leave. We waited way too long there after finishing our meal. It's not an absolutely terrible place to eat but I know I wouldn't come back to spend money here, it would have to be FREE! #SorryNotSorry",

Expensive, but in my opinion, well worth it if you are looking for the finest meats and seafood.  I ordered the surf and turf, which was on point, all the way.  Cooked perfectly and the flavor, top notch. The sides could have been a little better, but the filet and lobster more than made up for that.  I would definitely make a stop for dinner here again at some point.",

The sides were okay, but not worth the cost. If you want a great steak dinner, this is not the place!",

    "text": "Dry-aged beef FTW!  Been here for a few times and most recently after a tradeshow.  It seriously is one of my favorite steakhouse... anywhere  I always get the dry-aged New York strip sirloin, done medium rare.  It's an amazing piece of steak.  Must be around 20-24oz, it is just thick.  It's always grilled perfectly.  That first bite, when the fat from the steak just melts in your mouth... is just the best.  I never get any sauces or condiments to go with the steak since I think they season the steak so well that nothing is needed.  Having grilled with the bone gives it that extra flavor too.  Better than any steak I've had anywhere.  As for sides, that's the only downer.  All the veggies are pretty much sauteed and drenched in butter.  It's absolutely delicious but at the same time... it just might be too much.  Mashed potatoes are nothing special and mac & cheese isn't that cheesy to me.  Caesar salad is big pieces of romaine lettuce with grated parmesan reggiano.  Nothing special but the croutons is crazy good.  I can eat a bowl full.  Also got to try the fried calamari this time around.  Pretty damn delicious, especially with the marinara sauce.  But really, if you come to a steakhouse, the only thing that matters is the steak!  Located in NYNY, the steakhouse looks like a classic steakhouse from NY with the decor.  You would think it would be loud since it's right next to the casino floor but its more from the patrons that are dining and the high ceiling.  Make reservations, cause it's not big at all and it can get full fast.  If you want a lot of steak, order the Cowboy steak.  It is huge, just huge.",

Making reservations was easy and the customer service just over the phone was great, but even greater when we got there. Our waiter Preston  was not only charming but very experienced  in his trade.  He walked us through the entire dinner experience. I ordered the cowboy steak med rare expecting a much smaller portion I was pleasantly surprise to see the size of the steak. However the steak was a tad bit on the rare side our waiter must have watched me cut into it because he was right there to ask me if everything was OK. I told him it was a Little  to rare for my choice and he immediately took it back to the kitchen. When I got it back it was like they gave me  new steak. We had a amazing time and my husband and I will definitely be back. To sum it up, great service through out, wonderful atmosphere  and wonderful food. Best steak house so far. Thanks Gallagher's for making my wedding night so special.",

    "text": "I believe this was the best steak I've ever had. I told my girlfriend that the only two things I *had* to do during our stay in Vegas was hit the buffet at the Bellagio and have a steak at a fancy, classy steakhouse. The steak was the highlight of our trip.  We made reservations, and arrived 15 minutes early but were seated immediately even though we were prepared to wait at the bar. I would have preferred slightly more room between tables and a little less noise, but otherwise I felt the place was very comfortable. Our waiter was very courteous. I wore a sports jacket/tie and my gf wore a LBD, but it looks like the dress code isn't that strict. Still, I'm glad we took the classy route. You can relax and go slightly more casual if you want, but if you want to dress nicer like we did you'll fit in, too.  I ordered the signature sirloin, and I can't imagine why anybody would get any other steak. The filet may be more tender, but it couldn't possibly have flavor like this and believe me it was VERY tender. I ordered mine medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly. The edges were just a bit caramelized, the inside was a nice even pinkish-red. I love how they keep it on the bone, it really enhances the flavor. My girlfriend ordered the pork chop. I expected a single double-thick chop but instead it was two thinner chops, but it was still very tender. I had a taste and the sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but it was excellent. My gf loved it. She asked our waiter a question about what fruit it was made with, and he knew the answer without any hesitation at all (apricot I think?). VERY good waiter. We shared our sides, the potato certainly lived up to its \"colossal\" billing and the asparagus was nice and crisp, although I could have done without the heavy hollandaise sauce.  I ordered a wine by the glass. At the end of my second glass as we were getting ready to leave, I noticed there was a wine sediment at the bottom of my glass. I was impressed with the service and I'm sure if I'd noticed it when I started drinking it, they would have fixed it for me. So I don't hold it against them. My gf was very happy with her cocktail.  We were too full (and satisfied) to try dessert.",

Made a reservation to make sure we got in on time, as we had a show to catch. Definitely the way to go, since we saw a group turned away just before we got seated.  Had: Aged Top Sirloin - the aging sure did enhance the flavors of this steak. The beef is the highlight here. They don't try to cover it up. Cowboy Rib Eye - Big, tender and juicy slab of beef.  Both were perfectly cooked to order. We didn't eat any steak for a few weeks following this meal because we didn't want to follow up such good steak with something worse.  We also ordered the steak fries. These were great as well. Crunchy on the outside, hot, soft potato on the inside. The ketchup, omg the ketchup! Delicious ketchup with a kick. Our guess is that it's infused with truffle oil and possibly some roasted jalapeno as well. Whatever it is, it lifted the fries beyond 'just another basket of fries'.  Our waiter was attentive throughout.   We found out that there was an emergency in the kitchen (saw paramedics coming in), yet the only tell-tale sign was that our food took a little longer to come out. They  run a smooth operation.  We have no regrets picking Gallagher's over the other, more upscale steakhouses. The steak is definitely worth the price here, especially when you take into account the Strip premium.",

The ambiance is perfect; not Vegas cheesy, but classy, especially if you have one of the seats that faces out to the \"street\" in the casino. It's a refreshing change from some of the other Vegas dinner places that try a bit too hard.  The food is incredible. I have never had a bad steak here (ask me my opinion of Pacific Dining Car), and the sides are top notch. I highly recommend the beefsteak tomato salad, much different than doing a regular salad. And every other side I've had here really complimented the menu (the potatoes, the spinach). It's a complete restaurant.  The bar really knows how to serve them strong, has a good wine list, and a great beer list. And I've knocked back a few at the bar without even eating here.",

This is where I had one of the most great tasting Fillet Mignon I've ever had. Thinking about it still makes me Salivate. The meat is served just how you want them, out of all the times I've been in this place, I NEVER had to call on my server and had my meat re-done. Huge serving, I never realized how much meat I can consume after eating everything on my plate.  I must say after eating  everything, I could hardly breathe because I was so full. Money well spent on a giant size meal. Hands down!",

Noise level was way too loud. Wine list is terrible, not nearly enough wines by the glass, and selection was bad and shockingly overpriced. Sides as usual were very good. Too bad the signature steak, done medium rare, was simply soft/tender but had NO FLAVOR. Utterly embarrassing. My friend who went with us seems to have food poisoning now.",

Hubby tried the Filet Mignon which he really enjoyed, a tender piece and very tasty. I had the rib-eye which had perfect marbling and an out-of-this-world flavor! Both were good size cuts. We shared the Four Cheese Macaroni, Creamed Spinach and Yukon potatoes for sides, all were delish! As tasty as our meals were, the highlight was definitely the service. Our waiter was super attentive, friendly and offered spots to visit whilst in town (though we're not Vegas rookies). We're heading back this summer and will absolutely be returning to Gallaghers!",

I had their sateed mushrooms as my side. The portions were very reasonable for the price.   Service was excellent, our server answered all of our questions and gave us plently of attention.

Sit around for a bit before someone comes around and pours us water and walks away.   We sit some more before a server comes and asks if wed like a drink? Oh no welcome... Ok. I'll take a cucumber martini and can you bring a wine list. We Order a bottle of wine.   15 minutes later. He just opens it. No talk about it no introduction. Ok. Great wine. Then asks if were ready.   I ask about the 1 aged steak this restaurant has. [thank god I know what the aging process is because he didn't explain a thing abut it ]. I asked him if there was any feature. He said nothing except the catch of the day is mahi mahi... Which is weird because it says halibut on the board when you walk in. I asked him what was the seasoning on the fries, he asked me if I had an allergy... Then clearest bullshitted the ingredients. I responded with.... No I just wanted to the seasoning that's in the Steak Cut Seasoned Fries. I basically asked every single questioned that he could have answered had he said one sentence at the table.   Dinner:  Wedge.... Boring. Bland. Watered down blu cheese   Clam chowder.... Yummy one star  Aged strip ..... For the process that steak goes through I was expecting a ton of flavor. Disappointed.   Veal.... AMAZING ... Another star   Mushroom medley...    Bland   Puree...... Bland   I order a dirty martini for dessert.. I see it just sitting at the bar... So I got up to go get it. Then ordered another drink from the bartender since my server was no where to be found.   Then another guy closes us out... My sever had been missing since steak time.   Overall fail from this place.",

Our party of 8 was also squeezed into the smallest table possible; we kept having to move plates around to try and make everything fit (with reservations!). Yes, it's cheaper than other steakhouses, but I really think steak is one of those where it's better to do it big or don't do it at all.

My friend ordered Filet Mignon, and there was no bone. Not the biggest deal, but when your restaurant's signature is the bone-in feature, it is kinda disappointing.  Another friend and I both ordered Porter House medium. Mine was done right, but my friend's was on the well done side. The difference was noticeable visibly. My view about steak is that while the meat quality and preparation does matter, the cooking process is most important. I understand different chefs have different interpretation of what is \"medium\". But when two steak which are the same cut and ordered to the same table comes out that different, it just shows that something went wrong.",

Many are slightly overpriced; some are highly overpriced; and only a few deliver True value for your money. And that's the case with Gallagher's. We both had filet mignon and lobster, along with a plethora of sides and exclusive cocktails, and this place is worth every penny. It's nearly half the price of the big-name steakhouses both on the Strip and across the valley, but we felt the attention to the food and the service rocketed Gallagher's beyond the competition. Granted, this place is not cheap. It's for special occasions, but my god: The meat is aged for nearly a month (both wet and dry aging), and the chefs take special care to cook your steak precisely how you like it. These chefs know how to deliver a first-rate steak. Superb and delicious sides, first-rate drinks, and an attentive (but not hovering) wait staff make this our new Vegas favorite. And we're longtime locals. So you can trust us.  Don't spend $500 at the trendy steak places. Come to Gallagher's and see what True craftsmanship is all about. Spend half what you would at those big-name Strip steak joints, and save the other half for gambling.",

For sides we had Four Cheese Macaroni and the Yukon Gold potato puree which were super-tasty and we thoroughly enjoyed both, the caramelized onions were a perfect accompaniment for the steaks.  My only misgiving was that being on vacation and in a room with no way to preserve nor reheat leftovers we had too much food!  On our next visit we will just split one steak with the two sides (maybe also try an appetizer) and that should still be more than enough to fill us up.",

I have to say that the service was amazing!!!! The atmosphere was perfect for a romantic evening with my wife. We ordered a couple of appetizers to start of course. The choices were Oysters Rockefellers and seared scallops with bacon. I have to say it was super tasty and cooked to perfection. For dinner i had a aged steak with some truffle parmesan steak fries, and my wife had surf and turf lobster/ filet mignon. My meal was okay i didnt care too much for the fries definitely could of did without them and my steak was just okay, it was a bit tuff but flavor was good. I think next time ill try the cowboy steak i heard its better. My wife saidbher food was perfect.

A little overwhelming for some, but completely expected if your a regular visitor to the occasional fancy steak house. This was not that...fancy I mean. It was nice, dark and overall was a nice environment but I did get the \"Outback Steakhouse\" vibe which would make me think twice before heading there for a birthday or anniversary occasion as I can be a bit of a snob with my environment if I'm paying a hefty price (quality over quantity right?).   Sat down and within 2-3 minutes had our drink orders taken and the drinks delivered. What I can say is the service is impeccable and when you may not see a lot of your busy server you will always have a wait staff ready and willing at any moment near by.  Great place to stop before or after a show!",

I heard one person say the word bland several times. My guess is they were born without tastebuds. I can't speak enough about this restaurant. I don't write many reviews but felt compelled to do so for this one of kind authentic steak house. Everything from the drinks to the main course were absolutely mind blowing.   Our entire vegas trip was made worth it based on this restaurant alone. The waiter advised is to share a potato because they were big. Good advice. I'm can put down a lot of food but no me and my wife were perfectly satisfied with sharing the potato. The appetizer was a stuffed mushroom. Yes one mushroom. It was massive and like nothing we had ever eaten before. Not sure what all was in it, but we were sad to see that last bite go away. I came here to look up their menu because I had the best beer of my life there. Yeah they don't make the beer, but that was my first experience with one of the IPA's they had on tap that the waiter recommended when I asked. Even my wife liked it, and she isn't in to beer.  It was ballast point sculpin if you are interested. Anyway. If you want an amazing steak dinner in Vegas. Don't pass on gallaghers.",

    "text": "More like 4.5 stars -- almost perfect =P  Probably one of if not the best steak I've had in Vegas. I've been here 3 times already and each time has been great!  First of all, this place is always PACKED.  Make sure you have reservations or you'll have a wait around dinner time.  I've ordered the filet mignon twice and the queen cut prime rib once, and also have tried the porterhouse and the cowboy rib-eye (GREAT FLAVOR).  All have been superb, but I will say that my favorite is still the tender filet. Each time it has been cooked precisely medium-rare as ordered...which is often a difficult task even at some of the best steakhouses.  The one time I ordered the queen cut prime rib, I was disappointed after having such a great previous visit and ordering the filet.  Although the queen cut was a sizable portion (but not too big that I couldn't finish) they served me a medium-well to well (see pic), when I had ordered medium-rare. (I didn't bother sending it back cuz I was so hungry, just decided not to order it again in the future). The prime rib cut is on the thicker side and not quite as flavorful as prime rib I've enjoyed at other establishments that primarily serve prime rib (Lawry's or SF's House of Prime Rib). After that, I stuck with only ordering filet, which has been consistently top-notch.  BEST SIDE EVER: seasonal mushroom medley!!  Unbelievable! You'll have to taste it to understand.  Their sauteed spinach and macaroni are great as well.  Don't forget to save/make room for their creme brulee -- it's amazing!!!  This place is not your typical snooty, quiet steakhouse.  It's actually very lively, as everyone seems to be enjoying themselves in great company. Service was super friendly and attentive.  They checked on us regularly and we were never low on water. Only slight inconvenience would be that the restaurant itself did not have restrooms and you have to exit through the backdoor to use NYNY hotel's restrooms instead. However, that's really minor compared to the quality of food and service that you'll get here =)",

Yes, mi amigos, after nearly 12 years of sippin' on the purple drank in Houston, it is time for me & the H-town hubby to head west and live the quiet life in boring ol' Vegas.  Hmmm... whatever will a girl do for fun??  Well, for one, it's time to get my Yelp back on, and start wining & dining out more often.  Our official landing date is November 19 - Vegas, you have been warned!  Anyway, where was I?  Oh yeah, Gallagher's.  Well, we were staying at New Yawk New Yawk while finalizing the close on our new casa (maybe you've heard of it - some might call it The Bellagio - word!), so the natural spot for a feast fit for a king & queen was their high end steakhouse.  Yes, you drop some significant coin here, but it is totally worth it.  Hubby's filet was top 10 all-time, my food (whatever the heck I ordered) was really good, and both the beer & wine selection met our approval.  Plus, the bartender was super nice to us when we finished up our post-dinner cocktails at their bar.  So, there you have it - hopefully the first of many, many Las Vegas eatery & drinkery reviews on Yelp from moi.  And remember - I don't want the five dollars in your pocket, I want your soul...",

I didn't complain but the waitress took note and asked so I told her and insisted that I was ok not looking for another steak or freebie. We ordered desert, Cheesecake, which was fantastic.

The only vegetarian entree were the side dishes which is usually the case with steakhouses.  I got the STEAK FRIES  and FRENCH GREEN BEANS.  The fries were okay, needed a bit more seasoning but the ketchup was spicy and went well with the fries.  The green beans were also just okay.  Dessert was the usual warm lava cake.  It came with caramel toffee ice cream.  It wasn't bad but not that memorable.  The service wasn't as good as I would expect.  They brought out butter with the menu but didn't bring any bread till I mentioned it.  Refills were very slow too.  I ordered hot tea and they brought out the tea cup and hot water but no tea bags.",

This place is the neighborhood steakhouse that you just refuse to let go. The only difference is that this place is in cool casino.   I'm gonna keep this short, but make sure you get the dry-aged new York steak and get it medium (medium-well was a lil over).   Lastly, request server paul. He isn't gonna come over and butter your bread, but he is the hometown server that we all love. He's a guy's guy and you'll see when you meet him.  Enjoy! Aaron G.",

I would definitely do the creme spinach, cause it was creamy. My brother had the cowboy rib-eye which tasted way better. I forgot to add that the prices are ridiculously cheap.",

I ordered the rib eye and that first bite was just orgasmic...  The steak was perfectly seasoned with such an amazing flavor that just melted in my mouth.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  My friend ordered the New York and that was just as good.  Definitely a place to visit while in Vegas.  Ask for some horseradish on the side as well.  They were the strongest horseradish I've ever had in my life but so so good.",

Its the least to expect in a place where money is no object. The steaks were amazing and the waiter's knowledge of wine pairing was icing on the cake. Make reservations! And in if you're not familiar with this type of dining side dishes are extra and there is enough for at least 3 people with each order. By the way, you'll find this restaraunt in NEW YORK NEW YORK. And for a special treat end your meal with a cup of their coffee! I didn't get a chance to ask what brand it was but was to die for!",

Fuck, since nothing was right they should have just made up an order for us when we got there so it would have been at least warm when we got it. Was charged for everything we originally ordered that we never got. Not going back. I would rather shove shards of glass up my ass and sit in a tub of Tabasco sauce then endure this place again.",

Good fries though. No complaints about our beef. Overall, it was a good  dining experience.",

I will definitely make a stop here for an intimate dinner each time I go back to Las Vegas.  I ordered the Alaskan split King Crab legs and my date ordered the Cowboy Bone In Ribeye.  Both were amazing.  Our side was the Four cheese macaroni, it was so-so.  We glanced at the plates of our neighboring tables and noticed that everything looked yummy.  The service was superb... we never had to ask for anything and all of the workers were attentive to everyone.  There was someone making rounds for photos.. and we didn't feel hassled by her at all.  But we were celebrating a special occasion and ended up purchasing the pictures anyway, and she even threw in an extra picture at no charge.",

In fact, I almost gave this place a 2 stars b/c of the service.  first, we arrive on-time for our reservation but have to wait 15 minutes even though we can see 10 empty tables in the main dining room.  Then, they sit us in the doorway then act like it's a huge hassle to move us b/c we don't want to sit in the doorway (and get brushed by the servers running back and forth)    Food took forever to come out, in fact my buddy sent his steak back since it was room temperature when it arrived.  Trust me, my party consisted of three, low maintence guys, and we are generally indifferent to the service, but in this case, it was so bad tht all of us were very disappointed.  Possibly we got a bum server.  If they could guarantee better service and sides, I'd definitely go back since the steak was excellent.  In the meantime, I'll stick to Nine - IMO, the best steak joint in LV.",

He has told me many times this restaurant would not disappoint and it certainly did not.  The steak was one of the best Porterhouse steaks I've ever had. I too am not a huge dessert fan at restaurants but was recommended the toffee pudding cake.  WOW, I still think about it today.  It was like a toffee bar in every bite. I was worried it would be like bread pudding (not a fan at all, too dry).  This dessert was tasty and gooey and definitely memorable. The wait staff was excellent and very attentive.  Great experience!    Kathy Gallagher",

The hostess was a bit stuck up telling us she needed 9 out of 13 of us to be present in order to be seated.  I understand the reasoning behind their policy but she was very rude about it.  Things were better once we were seated.  Our waiter was very attentive and informative.  Our table ordered the mussels and calamari.  I personally didn't think it was anything special.  Our entrees arrived and it made up for the apps.  I ordered prime-rib and the significant other ordered their house special which was the the aged-steak.  The entrees were HUGE and super filling and their sides were delightful.  We did not have time for desert but that will be on the list next time.",
