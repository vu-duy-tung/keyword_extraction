    "text": "In the realm of steak restaurants, Outback has its place somewhere in the middle.  With that in mind, I give it four stars purely on a value basis.  Proportional to the cost of the meal, it's pretty good.  You will never mistake it for one of the many great steak houses in town, but at about 1/2 - 1/3 the price, you should be satisfied with what you got.  Its positioning across from the Galaxy Luxury+ Theatre has surely boosted business (True for all eateries around there), so make sure to give yourself a couple of hours lead time if you're planning on seeing an evening movie.  In terms of value oriented steak restaurants Outback is just a notch under Billy Bob's.",

    "text": "A no-brainer.  Outback Steakhouse is my favorite restaurant of all-time.  From their hot honey wheat bread and butter (with a hint of vanilla) to their succulent, fall-off-the-bone baby-back ribs and their mouth-watering delicious ribeye steaks, you can't go wrong at Outback.  You won't end up breaking your wallet here, either.  First off, the baby back ribs are the best I've ever had anywhere.  And I'm speaking of Outback Steakhouse in general, not just this location.  Second off, I was surprised to learn that they don't serve Teriyaki Ribeye at this location...I've seen it at practically every one I've been to in California.  When I inquired about it, they said they can serve the teriyaki sauce on the side, which is definitely the way to go.  The Teriyaki Ribeye is also my favorite steak I've ever had, anywhere.  Just an FYI.  And that bread...Jesus Christ, that bread.  It's to die for.  Seriously, if you haven't been to one of these restaurants before, you owe it to yourself to check it out.  You won't be sorry. (I should get paid for this review or something.)",

The appetizer came out fairly quickly, but our dinner never came! We sat there for OVER AN HOUR, and we were never served our meal. We had another appointment to get to, so after waiting for an hour, we left money on the table for the cost of the appetizer, and we walked out. Frustrating considering that in the hour that we sat and waited for our food, several other large parties were seated, served their food, paid their bills, and left. I can't speak for the quality of the food, because we were never served ours!! Their service really stinks. At one point during our visit, what appeared to be a manager came by our table. We asked him to check on the status of our order, because we had been waiting an hour, and we had another appointment to get to. He said he would check on it, but he disappeared and never returned! Next time we'll be trying the Larsen's Grill in the Galleria Mall. Don't waste your time at Outback!",

Our waitress Melanie A. is the worst most miserable server I've ever seen!  She was so rude and unfriendly....I was almost waiting for the hidden cameras to come out and say it was a joke!  We had the steak and all you can eat shrimp.  What a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!  Save your money and go to a buffet!  The steak was like shoe leather.  We ordered it Medium rare and it was Well Done and about 3 bites!  Both our baked potatoes were only half cooked!  The shrimp with garlic/herb was so disgusting that I can't even express it enough!  It was like salty mushy shrimp you buy in a can!!!!  It was not even edible!!!!  So we changed it to the fried shrimp.....after waiting 20 minutes for our server to be seen!  I still can't get over how rude she was!  Finally after 35 minutes we get 6 small fried shrimp in a dish!  Wow!!!! Don't hurt yourself Outback!!!!!  Usually \"fried shrimp\" come with cocktail sauce.....but nope!  Our server Melanie A. didn't bother bringing us any!  I am floored that they can hire such incompetent people to run this place and think it will succeed!  I can tell you that we will never be back here again!  I use to go to the Outback in Detroit.....and it was excellent every single time I went!  So I have to assume it's the people running it in Henderson....that will run it in the ground.  The quality and quantity of the food in Henderson is pathetic!  And almost $4 for a soda?  Are you kidding me?  And NO REFILLS?  You can go to any crappy buffet in this town and get way better food and service!  This place is an over priced joke!!!!!!!  Oh and before I forget!!!!!  The bathrooms were filthy and the floors in the restaurant were horrific!!!!  This place needs to shape up bigtime or ship the hell out!!!!!!",

    "text": "Outback opened this location up in the mid-90s. The fact that me and my family have never stopped going back should say something.  Outback is, essentially, an American restaurant with an Australian theme - mostly represented by the names of items on the menu and pictures/items on the wall. Pretty much any standard American dine-in restaurant fare you can find here, but they have a few other surprised on the menu as well.  The atmosphere in here can get a bit crowded and noisy at times, but that's to be expected of a place like this. Wait times can be frustratingly long during peak hours - even calling ahead doesn't help much. Fortunately, outside the restaurant there are plenty of benches on which to wait, so you won't be left standing.   The staff are extremely friendly and courteous - these people really go above and beyond what I see at most restaurants of the type. They are good about taking requests if you want an item done a particular way, and are very good about correcting any mistakes they may have made. One night, we were in the restaurant and they were packaging up our leftovers (which we were just taking home to give to the dogs anyway), but they accidentally threw them out. Before long, a manager was at our table apologizing, and even gave us a free dessert as a way of making it up to us.  The food itself is some of the best this reviewer has ever had. There is a little bit of everything, and none of it bad. The potato soup here is to die for, easily some of the best I have ever had. The entrees fare just as well - try the Victoria's Filet with a horseradish crush, and you'll see what I mean.   The long wait times to get into the restaurant during peak hours and the fact that this location is not open for lunch are my only real complaints. If you want a dine-in restaurant with great food, look no further than Outback.",

I live 200 miles from the nearest one now unfortunately, however every time me and my wife go to vegas, we eat at outback. I've tried about 3-4 different ones in town prior to this location, food has been good, not great and we have left unimpressed every time. I went to this location in Henderson one evening and the server that I had, whose name is Kent, was fantastic. My steak was extra spicy like I had asked and was full of flavor, cooked to the right temp and my broccoli was soft and juicy as well. Not all credit should go to him as the cooks that night were fantastic too, however due to his exceptional service and the quality and taste of the food that evening, I will no longer go to another Outback Steakhouse in the Vegas area. This one has earned my business and should Kent be working the nights that we dine in, he will be the server that I request. 5 stars for this particular Outback Steakhouse.",

They noticed it was wrong and sent out another steak. They sent out a steak that looked terrible and was almost raw and fatty. I think they were trying to punish me. The managemnet didnt care and the steak was terrible. I had a good server and paid my bill and tipped well becuase it was not the servers fault. But i would stay away from this outback.

Not cool and really makes me think they are trying to deceive the customer. This is on your computer check out system.  I rarely ever eat at Outback and I believe my last visit was 10 years ago.

Service was on the slow side as well. Skip this place and spend a few extra bucks and have a great experience at one of the many steak houses in vegas that has good service",

The service I had tonight was outstanding. Our waiter TJ was very diligent and super outgoing. Our drinks were always full, the service was fast, and fresh. The couple sitting next to us were extremely happy about the service too, as we overheard them talking about how excellent the food and TJ was.  We started off with the bread (obviously), and ordered about ten more loafs after that... (It's an addiction, I know). We also had the blooming onion, which never disappoints! For the main entree I ordered the filet mignon & lobster. I've gotta say.. the lobster was the best I've had in YEARS. I am very pleased with the fast and friendly service and I look forward to coming back soon! We weren't looking to spend as much as we did but it was damn well worth it. :)",

It was nice to know about her and her decision to relocate as well.    The food and portions were huge as my bf and I couldn't finish our apps and entrees.  We ordered their new lobster/seafood bites, a smaller portion of the infamous onion bloom.  Both were good and fried to perfection without having that oily aftertaste.   I ordered the tilapia with pure lump crab meat and both the fish and crab was moist and cooked perfectly.  Although, dessert would have been nice we both were too stuffed to even attempt it.

They have their own red wagon that they  sit in along with bowls and food. So..... There's no access to any food on the patio...in addition to being practically on the sidewalk.  The Hostess seats us-no problem, waitress arrives- seems mad cause she's ready to take our order...but we haven't been given menus,or  silverware,napkins or water. So she goes off to get menus...In the meantime the Manager walks by returning from an errand outside the place and pets the dogs.... Waitress comes back...with menus and takes our drink order...at that time I ask for a children's menu...as my  husband 81 year old mother enjoys when we bring her 'grilled cheese' back to her.....The next thing we know: 'Cody' a 'manager' shows up at our table...'Saying' we can't feed the dogs...and in fact they can't  even have water...he goes off on us...and then the yelling starts...we proceed to high tail in out of the place.... So...it's almost 9 o'clock at night, we waited over 15 mins, in that time we received menus and were yelled at my some low level 'manager'.... He doesn't stop there...he follows us out of the Outback Patio area...almost to our car...I had to tell him to please leave us alone....it was Extremely embarrassing as well as upsetting....Finally...the actual Manager who had walked by and pet our dogs shows up with another man Manager... Tried to soothe the situtation..... Offered us to come back and eat and/or did we want something to go?.... After being 'ran' off the property we didn't feel to comfortable returning...... Ever.... Reading reviews... It's not surprising that thery were pretty empty...apparent the food is 'marginal' as compared to other Outback's.... And Lastly, the  Main Manager, takes my email...says he's gonna contact me in regards to the 'situtation'.... It's been over 4 days...No Email.... It's too bad really, they have a wonderful patio, that has no Direct access to food/they could definitely draw pet owners by opening up that area... I realize the 'Health Department' oversee the guidelines to allow that, but they actually seem to be able to do that.... What our main issue was.... Why did 'Cody' have to come butt in and treat us the 'Way' he did...we went to eat NOT get YELLED at..... Some Customer Relations training for the staff is necessary.....ruined our otherwise perfect day!",

I went because we have a couple of gift cards and it really is close to my house. My partner got the ribs. They were tasty with a decent sauce and very tender. I got the grilled salmon. It was average, but I didn't expect more at a steakhouse. The grilled asparagus was a pleasant surprise.   My other surprise is that after two days, my stomach is finally getting back to normal. I'm not too happy about that. I still have money remaining on the gift card, but not excited about returning. I guess next time I'll stick to the beef.   I've tried several times to go to this place on the weekend, but the lines have been out the door. I refuse to wait at Outback. They are so darn popular. This visit was on a Thursday night and there was no wait.",

In TX I used to go so often to my neighbordhood outback I had a plaque @ the edge of the table w/ my name on it, literally. Crazy, huh? (and I was only 19) .. . yeah.  This place however just blah.  Service: The waitress was very akward. AWKWARD. I dont know if she was brand new but she seemed almost afraid to talk to us and paused before ever doing anything. She took our plates w/out asking. However, the girl that brought us our food was more waitressy, however she still pushed my salad plate out of the way to put down my steak plate? really?   FOOD: the side caesar was good. had enough dressing but somehow had a funny aftertaste that was not characteristic of my fav side caesar.  We both ordered the Outback special 9 oz with grilled shrimp on the barbie. WOW the shrimp stole the show! Either it was just that good or the steak was just that bad. I had a lot of chewy parts and the steak had no flavor. I actually had to use A1 sauce. Now if you dotn knowt his already, people in TX use lots of seasoning b/c the meat should be able to STAND ON ITS OWN.. and not be downed w/ sauces. Not this steak.  Blah. I wouldnt order it again.  If I came bk here again, I'd def. not order steak! .",

WIsh they would have kept the old one open up on Sunset. I know it's the same owner and staff but I think they're overwhelmed at this new location.  Staff seems overworked and the food is not what it should be.  Also seems like they've shrunk the portions on everything. This will survive based on the location but it is fitting right in with the other chains that closed in this center prior. Not sure why these chains can't figure out you still have to try and provide a good experience regardless of the name out front.",

I went in today 10/3/18 and ordered and encountered an issue with my meal.  My whole family is in the restaurant business so I understand how issues do arise and I know how some patrons can be so I wanted to alert my server in a discreet way and see what we could do to alleviate the problem without making too big of a spectacle.   Not only did he and the manager come over and offer solutions in a genuine and friendly manner but even the owner came over to apologize and make it right. The team here is ALWAYS amazing and I always have a pleasant experience. But, even when something bad happened, this awesome team stepped up and fixed it and kept a customer who loves this place happy and wanting to return ASAP!  Thank you to the wonderful folks at Outback Steakhouse in my neck of the woods on Stephanie St! ;)",

Our server was extremely busy but did his best to make sure we had everything we needed.  The two stars are because of quality control in the kitchen, not sure what was going on inside there??  We had a part of 8 and on one plate, she got her chicken she ordered, her potato and veggies, however, the paper receipt showing what was ordered buried under her chicken is not something that was ordered.  How does a paper receipt end up on a plate buried under food???  That was just an attention to detail issue that is becoming more and more of a problem with restaurants.  In the end, they did make her a new plate and did offer to give me a military discount, but why not honor military, active and retired 365 days a year?      Outback has gone down hill over the years and they try hard but still fail from time to time.  If they focused more on the business model being about the customer and customer support (from Corporate) they may enjoy a little more success.  Managers and servers trying their hardest but still having their hands tied does not allow the managers to do everything they would like to show customers come first.  It is what it is which is sad.  I only go here when I'm with people who suggest this chain otherwise I won't go, too many issues.",

    "text": "We visit this location often with family as this is one of their favorite restaurants. Fortunately, the restaurant offers reservations, however, there's almost always a wait for the table. I'm not sure how efficient this system is as we've waited upwards of 30 minutes for a table WITH a reservation, but I suppose that's better than without one. This is typically the case during holidays like Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc. There are large waiting areas inside and outside, but as expected, they become very crowded on those really busy days.  Everyone in the family loves steak and that is the primary reason we love visiting Outback. Their steaks are fantastic and reasonably priced. I usually order the Bone-in Natural Ribeye (approx. 20-22oz.), medium rare. It's wood-fire grilled over oak and seasoned well. It's a really nice cut with decent marbling and it is ALWAYS cooked perfectly. For $29.49, it comes with a type of potato and side; I like their Loaded Baked Potato or Aussie Fries and Steamed Broccoli.  For Starters, I really like their Bloomin' Onion (of course) and Gold Coast Coconut Shrimp. We've also tried a few of their other dishes like the Steakhouse Philly, Perfectly Grilled Salmon, Steakhouse Mac and Cheese, and Blue Cheese Wedge Salad. Everything is decent, though I did not like the salmon; it was terribly dry and unpleasant enough to not finish. Since the food doesn't always seem to fare, we stick to the steaks now. I am always very satisfied with my Bone-in Ribeye!  They, along with the rest of their parent company's portfolio (Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, and Bonefish Grill), offer Dine Rewards. It's free to join and you earn Qualified Visits. After three visits within six months, you receive a promotion of 50% off your next (fourth) visit up to $20. It's double at Fleming's, so you save up to $40 off. You also receive other promotions throughout the year like $5 (or $10) off your meal. You have to give your phone number to the server to get credit for your Qualified Visit. There is a way to enter the information online, but it is painful. The website states it may take up to two weeks for your credit to apply and for me, it's taken longer.",

On the day I visited this particular location,  We were running a pretty tight schedule due to seeing a movie across the street.  I thought I had given us plenty of time to spare and though the house was busy, we did not have to wait and were seated after entering.  Sadly, from the time the we ordered which was shortly after seating, time kept ticking away and the food never came.  After telling the waitress about the time crunch, she went to see what she could do but alas, after forty-five minutes we had to leave.  There was some tension when I said we had to get going between me and the waitress but all in all she handled it professionally.  She said the sodas and BO app we ordered were on the house.  I said we would pay for what we ate, and she apologized.  I gave her what the cost of what we consumed would have been plus a tip.  My thanks to her dealing with a stressful situation with no attitude.  As a result, I will be back to enjoy all the OS has to offer.",

We normally go to the one on Las Vegas Blvd.  Let me start by saying the service started out good with a quick drink order and a Free Bloomin Onion Monday.   My husband decided to order the Sirloin and unlimited shrimp. - Steak ordered Medium  My 16 year old son also ordered the Sirloin and unlimited shrimp. - Steak ordered Medium Well  I ordered the 6 oz Filet and unlimited shrimp. - Steak ordered Medium  Food arrives at the table and I immediately cut into the center of my steak checking for a correctly cooked steak. My steak was cook medium well, not medium like I ordered.  Now, I asked the waiter before ordering how they cooked a medium steak and his response was to open their menu and show me a picture of a perfectly cooked medium steak.   My shrimp was extremely over cooked and I couldn't stomach eating another bite. Now if you've had over cooked shrimp, you know exactly what I'm talking about and how gross it can be!  My sons steak was a perfect medium well, which is what he had ordered. His shrimp was kind of edible.  My husband cut into his steak or should I say he tried, but it was extremely over cooked and the temp was more than WELL! Imagine a dry hard steak!  His shrimp was just okay. They took his steak away and said they would recook another one medium. He ate his shrimp and patiently waited for his new steak to arrive.   Finally it arrived and he cut into the steak to reveal a Medium Well steak, again not a Medium! He told the waiter he would just eat it since he had already waited long enough and was very hungry. He and my son ordered three more orders of shrimp.   The three additional orders of unlimited shrimp never came and we finished eating. The waiter came to inform us we would receive one free dessert for our troubles. My husband informed him they had not received the other three orders of shrimp and he said I'm sorry and walked away. 60 seconds later a lady brought the shrimp and I told her we were finished eating. I explained they had ordered that a long time ago. She responded with I'll bring you a to-go box. We said, no thank you.   The manager arrived at our table to let us know he decided to take my husbands steak off our bill and give us a dessert of our choice. We ordered and they brought the bill over.  My husband failed to look at the bill and paid. I asked if they had taken the Free Bloomin Onion off and he looked and said, no! The manager brought the dessert and my husband told him about the Bloomin Onion and he told my husband he would void the bill for the previous charge and recharge my husbands credit card.   We ate the dessert and left.   My overall opinion is this Outback needs better training, cooks and possibly new management! The food should have better quality control!   One thing I know, is food and how to cook it properly! This Outback lacks an experienced cook, the waiters attitudes are \"okaaay\" like what am I supposed to do and the management seems to be out of his element!   Good luck if you choose to eat at this location!",

This time the $51 steak came out so rare it was purple! We sent it back to get it the medium we ordered and when it came back it was burnt and super well done. We felt bad but sent back for a new one (which we've never done, but at $50+ we wanted to be happy). They gave us new sides each time, were incredibly patient and apologetic.... just the best experience with a steak issue. We always have great experiences but this was over the top.",

    "text": "I haven't been to an Outback in about 10 years and couldn't figure out why.  It obviously wasn't that great a decade ago otherwise I would have visited again.  My husband and I were out running errands and dinner time came upon us, so the closest thing was Outback.  My husband wanted a steak, so I didn't mind.  We got there at about 6:50ish and were told the wait would be about 15 mins.  The restaurant was packed with people waiting, so the only seating available was outside.  It was about 112 degrees and felt like a blow dryer with the wind kicking up.  I also had my 2-year old waiting outside braving the heat.  There was a complimentary water jug for people waiting outside, but it sat empty the entire time.  About 25 minutes passed... So I decided my daughter's red flushed cheeks were a sign I should squeeze inside.  We basically stood right in the doorway just to get some AC, having to move out of the way every time customers entered or exited.  Another 35 minutes went by, and my daughter grew increasingly restless and hungry.  I told my husband to see if they skipped us or something and he was told we were up soon.  It was probably another 10 minutes before we were called.  I already decided at that point that I would not be coming back.  I thought about going next door to Yogurtland for dinner numerous times.  I don't mind waiting 5, 10 or even 15 minutes past what I'm told, but don't lie to me when you know the wait is no where close to 15 minutes.  Terrible customer service.  I would have rather them be honest and tell me it would be over an hour.  That way I could make the decision whether to stay and wait or find some place else.  After being seated, I ordered the salmon and it tasted like a cup of salt had been dumped on it; it was bad.  The price of the nasty fish I just ate pissed me off further.  My husband ordered a medium-rare steak and what he got was medium in some spots and well in others.  He doesn't complain much, but I could tell by the way he kept inspecting it, he wasn't too happy.    For the price of average food (way too high), I was extremely disappointed.  The wait time is what basically pushed me over the edge, especially having to wrangle a hungry, hot 2-year old for over an hour.  Hopefully I don't make the same mistake in another decade.",

    "text": "Because the french onion soup at YardHouse did not satisfy me and I remembered that the french onion soup at Outback Steakhouse was pretty yummy, I asked my fiancee to take me there.  Initially, he thought I wanted steak so he suggest we go to the steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch.  I told him that Outback has the 4 course meal for $15, which is a steal!  Not really when you consider the quality of food served to you.  Both Earl and I opted to pay a supplementary charge of $8 to get the 6 oz Victoria Center Cut Filet.  It supposed to be tender, but guess what?  Mine had the sinue, which made it tough and chewy as hell.  I tried really hard to cut the sinue off, but ended up having Earl cut it  off for me.  C'mon now Outback...Can you really call it \"tender\" with that piece of crap it it?  I also paid the $1 upgrade to change the walkabout soup of the day to my french onion soup.  At least that was good.  Earl had the walkabout soup, which is lentil and sausage soup.  He commented that it's a good thing I didn't get that soup because it tastes like crap.  When it came time for dessert, there are only two choices to chose from, the cheesecake or the carrot cake.  We took that home and I did not enjoy the cheesecake.  What kind of cheesecake does not have a crust?  This crappy cheesecake at Outback Steakhouse.  WTF?  Seriously people.  Stick with the crust because this noncrust cheesecake is crap.  Now service...CRAPPY as well.  The server breath smells bad.  Every time he talks, I have to gasp for air in a different direction.  Additionally, he happened to left his drink tray on our table while tending to other guests.  WTF again.  After he took a table's order, gave another table their to go boxes, clean some plates off of another table, he then picked up that drink tray without saying one word to us.    The night's dinner experience was crappy, nonetheless, I am OUT and never come BACK.",

My mash potatoes were warm and the sauteed mushrooms tasted as if they came out of a can. I don't like to complain and have my food redone but had to do it this time. The steak and mashed potatoes were good when they came back. I told them to not bother replacing the mushrooms. The service was OK and overbearing at times. We had two waiters. The first one kept interrupting to make small talk and was a bit pushy. At one point she sat down next to my friend to take the order. That was strange!  Then it switched to another waiter who rushed me to finish talking when I explained about my steak. I guess he didn't want to her it.",

If I am treated rudely, I'll never return, regardless how good the food tastes, or how reasonable the prices are.  I take into account the quality of the cuisine, of course, but again, I give the majority of my assessment to the quality of the personnel, and the two folks noted above, EXCEEDED my expectations, definitely.  I will continue to choose this particular location, whenever I have the urge to tear into an 18 ounce Porterhouse, prepared with \"no pink\" inside.  This one has permanently \"spoiled\" me!",

It wasn't my choice of restaurant of course, but my friend Angie gave me that doe-eyed look when I suggested that our dinner spot could be her choice.   I will admit that upon arriving I assumed I'd be stuck with an option of salad and....salad. Much to my delight I had some options to choose from and this is what I indulged in:  Complimentary bread- Comp bread is just that... you're stuck w/ what you get, but surprisingly it was fluffy and not rock solid when taking a bite and the waitress didn't mind bringing multiple refills to enjoy w/ our entrees.   Caesar Salad-  Salad was fresh and made perfectly as requested with NO dressing and blue cheese crumbles added on top.   No Rules parmesan pasta- I loved this. They have an actual pasta listing where I can ADD meat if I want to or just get the pasta independently. Also, the waitress was good about asking me how \"spicy\" I want my noodles and made sure I was aware that they use cayenne pepper to add spice which I appreciated knowing.  Strawberry Peach Sangria- Light floral notes w/ floating strawberries on top. Delicious to say the least and something refreshing I could sip throughout dinner.  Not my first, second, or third choice to eat as a vegetarian, but as far as being accomodating to my diet, I'd say above average.",

Not wanting  to cook....and wanting something  different. ..we remembered  that the outback  was close by.  The hostess was kind, and sat us right away.   I dont remember  our waitress' name....but she was kind, and attentive. Of course,  whats a visit to outback without a blooming onion ? I got the lamb, added the potato soup, and we also had the hearts of mahi mahi.  The blooming onion  was meh. Honestly,  we didnt even have 1/3 of it. I regret  ordering it.  Kind of like a bad onion ring.  The loaded potato  soup was quite good...plenty of flavor, and very creamy.   My lamb came, and was wonderfully cooked. They were decent sized chops and juicy. They did have quite a bit of fat on them....not very appetizing,  i wish they would have trimmed it off. My two year old and I still enjoyed it.   The hearts of mahi mahi was okay. Just okay. It really  tasted like it was missing something,  but the fish was cooked beautifully.   With 2 drinks, an appetizer and a kid's  grilled cheese,  the bill was $80. A little pricey... but the food was decent  enough  for us not to mind.  Hop over to Yogurtland afterwards  for dessert.!",

She checked with us to fill drinks and bring fresh bread during the meal. She also chatted for a minute which made the meal even more pleasurable. The food was good but not great however the coconut shrimp should have been cooked a bit more. The salads are not worth the money at all. Customer service was a 5 but the food gets a 4. I'm gonna try another choice next time to see if they perform better in the kitchen. Love the vibe at the bar.",

We had to wait about 10 minutes when we got there, but that wasn't too bad.   Our waitress, Lindsay, was OUTSTANDING. She knew the menu very well, and even if she wasn't fond of specific foods that we asked her about, she still gave us good descriptions of how each food tasted and was prepared. She was also very personable, which is always a delight at any restaurant. She kept our glasses filled the entire time, and we never had to track her down to ask for anything because she frequently checked up on us.   The food was good, like any other Outback Steakhouse, but it came out much quicker than I expected due to how many people were there. Overall, I was definitely impressed by the speed and friendliness of service.",

As it turned out, the occupants of the table had finished their meal, paid their bill and were sitting and visiting, and visiting, and visiting - for an hour!  David, the manager was very aware of the situation. Because of the size of our party another table coming open soon was not about to happen. When our table finally opened we were treated to complimentary appetizers and desserts. Our servers were quick with excellent service and our meals were delicious!  Thanks for a great evening!",

    "text": "As I work in a restaurant and study hospitality at UNLV, I have never been one to complain on Yelp. However, I believe that this dining experience deserved to be shared.  We were there celebrating my mother's promotion at work. Everything was good, the server was friendly. However, my mom's steak came out rare rather than medium. No biggie. We send it back, they say that it will be fixed. About five minutes later, the same half-eaten, cut up steak comes back. They had recooked her eaten steak. When we made it clear that this was unacceptable, we were told by both the server and the owner of the restaurant that it was their restaurant's standard to recook steaks that had already been served on the SAME grill that their other customer's steaks are being cooked on.  This is where I became concerned. Being ServSafe Certified and a SNHD Food Safety Manager, I told the owner \"You might want to speak with your managers about that practice. It's against health code to take someone's eaten food back, cook it next to other customer's food, and then reserve it.\" This is a cross-contamination DISASTER. After I told the owner that, he replied \"Oh, it's completely compliant with health code.\"  So here, for you, is the SNHD section of health code that prohibits this process.  \"3-306.14 Returned FOOD and RE-SERVICE of FOOD  After being served or sold, and in the possession of a CONSUMER, FOOD that is unused or returned by the CONSUMER may not be offered as FOOD for human consumption, except a container of FOOD that is NON-POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS may be transferred from one CONSUMER to another if:  (A) The FOOD is dispensed so that it is protected from CONTAMINATION, and the container including but not limited to a narrow-neck bottle containing ketchup, steak sauce, or wine is closed between uses.  (B) The FOOD including but not limited to crackers, salt, or pepper, is in an unopened original package and is maintained in sound condition.\"  Also, we were given the full bill at the end - re-served steak and all. The owner saw that and quickly said \"let me go take that steak off for you.\" We just left cash to get the hell out of dodge. It is not that the employees or managers were malevolent - they are just uneducated when it comes to health code. That can be a dangerous combination in the restaurant industry.",

However, I was extremely and pleasantly surprised with my experience here today.  We walk in, and the place is packed at 5:30. We opt for the bar and the friendly hostesses point us in the right direction. Within a minute of sitting down at a high top, our server, Kent, dropped by to let us know he was gonna be right with us. He returned shortly and took our drink orders, remembering to ask if my boyfriend wanted sweetener for his iced tea since most people don't ask. He showed up with our drinks and brought fresh bread and took our order.   We ordered the snack blooming onion, caprese and snack quesadilla. Although we only ordered 15 dollars of food, Kent didn't seem to mind or have the typical \"these people aren't ordering a lot so I'm gonna get stiffed\" attitude. All the food was pretty decent, surprisingly the quesadilla was the best part. Furthermore, the food came out really quickly which was nice.  Kent checked up on us regularly offering more bread when empty, and promptly refilled drinks before they were even half empty. He was quick and efficient, which was perfect because we were in a time crunch. He was able to drop and run the check within 5 minutes or less. You could tell he was definitely doing figure 8s around his section. What really blew me away was when we were completely cashed out, he offered to grab to go cups for our drinks. Small touch, but extremely thoughtful.  Lastly, I haven't been in this place in years. The new renovation is just darling. The inside has lots of open space with quirky and modern touches, such as a wine box branded with \"blooming onions\" on it filled with a box of huge white onions.   Perhaps we just got lucky, but we are definitely adding this place to our rotation of restaurants to stop by in. Kent did a superb job, and I hope he is recognized by his superiors for his hospitality.",

We ordered our entree's and began chatting. Before we knew it they brought out the salads and shortly after the our meals which included a 6oz filet and 5oz lobster tail 5/5, 12oz New York strip 5/5, 12 breaded shrimp with fries 4/5, garlic filet medallions with garlic mash potatoes 5/5, chicken on the barbie with steamed veggies 5/5 and an appetizer platter with Aussie cheese fries topped with bacon, mac and cheese bites and deep fried mushrooms 4/5.   Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals and to top it off they brought out a birthday sundae and sang to my mum and her friend (2 birthday ladies). Laura B was a good server and was attentive to our needs 5/5.   When the check came I inquired about military discount which they said is seasonal and not given all of the time.

There is nothing exceptional about the food or menu at this location, but I am leaving a review because of the excellent service I receive every time I visit. They are always friendly and almost always get the order right, even on pick up orders.  One thing I will suggest is a simple phone tree that tells the hours and lets you select to order a pick up. It can sometimes take a while for them to transfer the call over.",

My Fiancee's salad had the dressing on the bottom of the bowl. When our entrees came out they looked like they where in a heat lamped way to long. Both sandwiches where very salty and over cooked and dried out. The  French fries were soggy from the juice of the sandwich and where over salted and cool. When I complained to the duty Manager I could tell he didn't take me serious as a customer. The server was good that we had and I felt sorry for him, because it not his fault they had bad cooks and management. I have to say I will not go back to this Outback again. Burger King would have been much better or anything else:-(",

With all the other stores/ restaurants here, parking always seems to be a challenge, in and out is crowded, however, not overly busy.  Inside, the restaurant is very welcoming, has seating for a wide variety of party sizes.  4 stars.  b.  Service - From the moment you attempt to open the doors, and instead the staff opens them for you, to being seated and having a server, I found the Service here to be top notch and a reason to come back. They will treat you and your family like VIP clients.  I give them 5 star.  c.  Food -  We had the   Blooming Onion - not bad, gotta have one.  Chicken Rib Combo - Tasted good, way too much fries on this and not enough meat though.  3 star.  Sirloin and Lobster tail - Son ordered this and scarfed it down. Lobster easy to extract from the tail and the steak was tender. A bit expensive, however, pretty good.  4 star.  Mac N Cheese - My daughter had this and the consistency was very \"runny\" The sauce was not thick, more watery.  I give this 2 star.  needs improvement.  Ribeye - Served with Garlic Mash and String Bean.  The wife ordered this and I give it a solid 3.  Not too shabby, nothing to write home about.  Salmon and Vegetables - the salmon was pretty good, about 3-4 ounce service.  Yet, the vegetables were very typical and a bit bland.  The portion I thought was a bit spartan, however, I goes for being a healthy choice, it should be.  GK says check it out for a family affair.  Not shabby, especially if Olive Garden is fool and you are in the franchise, convenient and average type of food that I consider to be not bad at all.",

I didn't get her name since she just gave me a bad impression once we entered the restaurant. We ate there yesterday around 3pm and wasn't busy crazy but regulars that knew about the free bloomin onions were there. Check out their specials online before you go so you don't miss out on freebies. When you do go, ask to have Jason as your server, then you'll have guaranteed amazing service.",

So the manger telling me my food is done but I don't want to eat it is such a dumb statement. She made me so angry I didn't even respond to that remark. I guess she thinks I'm at the mall yeah that's it...I came to buy shoes because noone in they right mind would come to a steakhouse and wonna eat.  It's like little mama look here as hungry as I am you not going to get my plate back because I'm as hungry as a hostage. You have the dish back ONLY because I don't wish to die eating from eating under cooked pork.  Oh as always I provided pictures u can see I spit out bits of under cooked meat...  No I don't think I will return. She was more into telling me how the dish is cooked how its so called slow cooked. Look I'm gonna tell it how it is...Its not my job to care how it cooked its my job to order, eat,  pay, and yelp...she made me so mad I took the picture just to show you all I spit the food out. This is the only picture Ive taken of its kind. To prove a point. Even a 3 year old knows that if someone spits out food its NOT good. Pffff! But they get 3 stars for the soup salad and bread.",

I usually shkoff down the filet with lobster and I must say for a local's spot, their filet is pretty good and the lobster is not an oversized shrimp but a decent sized lobster tail that rivals any nice steakhouse in my opinion. For under $30, I sometimes wonder why we bother going to the strip for steak a la cart when you get all the fixings here at Outback with your meal. Plus you don't have to dress to impress here, atmosphere is casual and you come to eat.",

I visited Outback 2 times in the last year due to friends going there. And I saw FAKE meat on the plates. NOT your geniune butcher cut meat straight from a cow. Now I dont know their process or where their meat comes from But I have to give them a thumbs down.

    "text": "Using the the feature online to get on the waiting list for our party of seven on a Sunday night, we were advised to come in around 45 minutes later at 7 PM. After we arrived, we were told by the hostess that we were waiting for the party to leave that was sitting at our table, we waited about 10 minutes in the waiting area. From there, everyone enjoyed a delicious family meal.  You know what to expect from the Australian inspired restaurant and they have consistently come through for me. Steaks are what is at their core and they provide a selection of 8 cuts of aged steak with your choice prepared either classic seasoned & seared or wood-fire grilled. I don't think you can go wrong with either, it just depends on how much smoky flavor you want. Cooked to order, there are actual photographs of what each temperature looks like on the menu. Speaking from experience from the service side, this is a good move because a good number of customers are unaware of how proper temperatures should present.  Ironically, their consistency did not come through for me with the Victoria's Filet Mignon Portabella ($24.99) as I requested medium rare and it came out hockey puck well done. But they did a fine job of rectifying the situation after I informed our server. She immediately acknowledged the mistake and apologized, offered me something else while I waited for the re-cook, and had the manager run out the perfectly cooked re-fire.  Also ordered was the well known bloomin' onion ($8.79), Aussie fish tacos ($11.99), the 7 oz. perfectly grilled salmon ($15.99), and from the special hand carved roasted sirloin menu, the classic roasted sirloin (8 oz. $14.99) and the marsala roasted sirloin (5 oz. $12.99). Everyone was pleased with their meals. If you like sweet potatoes, I would recommend this as a side for an additional $2.99. It comes topped with honey butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Don't forget desserts here either as they have a variety of mini and shareables selections.",

Walked in about 7pm, and were seated right away, even though they looked busy. Our server, Amanda, was great- very attentive and friendly. I was pleased right away to see that they had some new menu items- those new shakes look awesome!   We ordered a couple of beers, and a Bloomin' Onion to start. Amanda asked if we wanted the half size, which was great since I didn't know they could do that! It was the perfect size for 2 people! For dinner, my husband and I both ordered the new Steak and Lobster combo. They have different options to upgrade. I got the $14.99 version, which was tasty (only comes with one side) and the hubs ordered the upgraded Victoria's filet for a little more. He said it was great, and I believe him since he ate it all before I got a chance to ask for a taste!   The best part was that I had mentioned to our server that we were celebrating an anniversary, and right as we finished our meal Amanda brought out a complimentary dessert for us!!! It was the new French Toast Bread Pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I normally am not a fan of Bread Pudding, but it was so delicious!!! There wasn't one bite left. Thanks, Amanda!!   We really enjoyed our evening out, and even without gift cards, it wouldn't have broken the bank! We'll definitely return soon to try some of those other new items!!!",

    "text": "After a long night of drinking, I was craving a steak.  Outback was the closest place to a steakhouse near me and since I've always had a good experience there, it was a sure win!  This location is a stand along building on the south side of Sunset avenue, in the same lot as Lee's Discount Liquor and Wildfire Lanes.  If you've been to an Outback before, you've been to them all.  It's filled with wooden panels, neon lights and seems to be very consistent with every Franchise.  I did appreciate the fact that there was a separate entrance to the Take out service, as I was in my PJs, however, the take out area was SUPER small.  There was already someone else waiting there and already seemed to be very packed.  Don't get me wrong though, the staff was super nice, super attentive and more than willing to help me out, however, thank goodness I called ahead.    For dinner, I got the 12 oz. Ribeye steak for $22.49.  One of my favorite cuts of meat, well marbleized, savory and full of flavor.  I ordered my steak medium rare and on the wood fire grill.  For the sides, you get 2 btw, I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and the steamed green beans.  The green beans were crunchy and fresh!  I can tell they were sauteed a little in oil.  The mashed potatoes were nice, not too creamy and wasn't garlicy at all.  In fact, I couldn't tell there was garlic, really.  The steak was seasoned very well.  I highly recommend having it done on the woodfire grill as you'll get a smokey flavor.  The inside was cooked to my liking, however, it seemed my steak was overly stringy.  Now I've had many Ribeyes in my days and have always had it medium rare.  This cut seemed very close to a Chuck eye, rather than a ribeye.  I'm sure it wasn't a chuck eye, but I don't necessarily think this cut was top notch.    This visit was just alright for me.  It wasn't a stand out in my book.  I've always stood behind Outback, so I know I'll be back.  Hopefully my next visit to this place offers a little more than this last time.",

This place also gets you seated surprisingly quickly for the long line at the door. If you attend I highly recommend the Aussie Cheese Fries for an appetizer, they are one of my favorite items on the menu. The prices are a little expensive but if you're looking for good food with an amazing atmosphere and exceptional service, I highly recommend this place.",

My Mother-in-law frequently sends my husband and I gift cards to Outback so we pull up to the bar at our favorite location and every time Adam, the bartender remembers our names and has a smile on his face! We do not even bother getting a table, we just eat at the bar. I tend to order the 6 oz.filet, with the house salad and the tangy tomato dressing with a loaded baked potato. What could be wrong with that! I say nothing, it is always delicious and I am so crazy for the tangy tomato dressing, did you know you can ask to buy it to take home...or I will order the Alice Springs chicken with the same sides, and that is always just as good too. I love this place, it is great, the price is right, the atmosphere cozy and it is consistent!",

He would have eaten it as it was but  she went and got the manager who insisted that they make him another the way he wanted.  The next steak was just the way he wanted it.  I was very pleased and will definitely return there in the future.  My only suggestion is that you make a reservation as otherwise there is a long wait.",

This week was Australia and Outback Steakhouse is as creative as we are going to get with this country unless we can find pasties and meat pies.   There is nothing spectacular about Outback, but you will definitely get a good meal. Arriving at 8:30pm, there was no line and were seated quickly. After a day of amazing service, our waitress for tonight was ok. Our drinks took some time to come out, but we had bread to distract us. Once the blooming onion came out it looked like a pack of lions ravaging a zebra carcass.   I had ordered the 16oz. prime rib and it comes with two sides; the wedge salad subbing the ranch with the mustard vinaigrette to begin with and a sweet potato to go along with my meal. The salad was delicious. The sweet potato was good, but I should have asked for the brown sugar and butter on the side. It doesn't need it. Everyone else ordered steaks and were happy with their meals. Outback is not my first choice when it comes to satisfying my carnivore appetite, but it will do. At $23 for my meal, you can find prime rib for cheaper at most places in Vegas.",

Also, we were craving a good steak, and we didn't feel like dressing up at a high end steakhouse. Outback is a great value, it includes your side with a soup or salad and that complimentary bread. The quality of food has been consistent for us. I had the 13 oz ribeye with garlic butter sauce and some mushrooms on the side, and my hubby got their special 16oz blackened garlic prime rib. We had the fried mushrooms as an appetizer and love their French onion soup. For less than $100 including tip this was a great value for a delicious anniversary meal. We opted out of dessert because we had a cake at home. Our server was very friendly and  attentive. The manager also checked if we enjoyed our meal towards the end. The kiosk to pay at the table is very convenient. We also ordered our appetizers through the kiosk. Be sure to sign up for their rewards program and check in on Yelp for that free bloomin onion!",

But we found ourselves here while in Henderson, NV on business.   The place was packed but we were seated right away for some unknown reason... it certainly wasn't our celebrity.  Our waitress was very nice, and attentive, despite the heavy customer load.  The owner was also buzzing around checking in with patrons, wanting to make sure everyone was being served well.  Don't know if he was actually the owner, or if he would do anything to help, but it was a nice touch.   Prices were higher than I expected, but everything is getting more expensive these days.  They are a bit higher than Texas Roadhouse though.   Everything we had was good; the steaks were prepared as ordered and we left satisfied, and perhaps a little overstuffed.  It was easily my best experience at an Outback Steakhouse, but it was a big bill for just two people.",

He advised of of all our choices and made some great recommendations for a large group.  We started with the cheese fries and I give them five stars.  They were hot and very tasty.  Everyone ordered steaks (Ribeye medium, Filet medium, and a Porterhouse medium), I loved my Ribeye and everyone else at the table were very happy with their steaks and the taste.  The seasoning was right on the mark and added just the right flavor for a nice hot steak.  This is my second night in Vegas for a conference, and I have to say, so far I have had nothing but amazing experiences during my travel.  if come to this OutBack, ask to be seated in Javon section, and I hope you have a great experience like we did.",

The wait staff seemed kind of kerfuffled, kind of like they were getting slammed  except they werent. It was about 1/3 full. We almost got a greeting but then the two ladies at the front had some staffing issues to discuss while we waited. I remember Outback as a pretty nice place (again I havent been in a LONG time, nor have I ever been to this one). The kind of place you would take a date and get fresh pepper ground on your salad. I wouldnt take a date here. The menus were old and worn, the disposable salt and pepper grinders were cloudy and almost empty. My husband ordered pork ribs and chicken, which were good, but he traded the fries that came with it for a salad and the waiter asked if he wanted it with dinner or before. He chose before so his ribs and chicken came on a plate all lonely. Not even a parsley sprig. I had the Cobb Salad which was the exact same Cobb Salad I got the last time I ordered one at Dennys. Wouldnt go back,  would go to Dennys instead where my expectations would be lower.",

Bret and Trent were nothing short of phenomenal. The water glass never got empty and they were spot on with drinks. I love the fact that this bar carries a local brew (Lovelady). That right there bumps a bar up for me, even if it's not a brew I enjoy. That being said, they had the Outbock which is a cross between an IPA and a Bock, and it is AWESOME!! We ordered the crab cakes for a starter. If you have followed us at all, you know we are crab cake snobs. With that, we really enjoyed Outback's. When they brought them out, it smelled like crab, always a good first impression. They were very good with a good balance of crab vs. breading. We will definitely be back for those. We ordered the Ribeye and we were very pleased. Cooked to perfection and a very good cut of beef. We were very happy with our food and our service, and we will most certainly be coming back. Be sure to say hello, we'll be at the bar.",

For there being a large group of us they got our food pretty quick and she even remembered who ordered what.  The food was really good. I could eat the asparagus all day.

It had been some time since we went to Outback, we found out that you can call ahead and get your name on \"the list\", I knew that they did this for very large groups, but not for couples. Whoops, I was wrong... so call ahead and get your name on the list! We waited 30-45 minutes and finally got seated. Things started looking up until the salad came. They forgot the salad dressing, well, no big deal, we will flag down our waiter, but we didn't see him for some time, but another waitress came by and asked if everything was ok, and we mentioned that we would like salad dressing for our salad. So we drank our water until it was gone then our waiter came with the dressing and was so apologetic, he was sorry he forgot to bring it out, but right behind him was our main meal being served by someone else.  Ok, we had our meal, so we finished our salad, they my wife had the special, and I had the Melbourne Steak plate. This steak tasted like compressed sawdust, and my wife said her food tasted burnt. We were so disappointed that we just wanted to leave, we did complain to the waiter, and he said the manager would be over to talk to us. That never happened. I don't know if we will ever return to THAT Outback again.",

Amazingly accurate wait time from the host staff and beverage jar with water for while you are waiting. Our server, Michelle, was one of the best servers I have had. She was super busy but attentive and always went a step above, even with my crazy requests and indecision. The children's meal was great. Salads were fabulous The vinaigrette on the Wedge cut the creamy dressing and blue cheese perfectly. The new crab and avocado appetizer was good but lacking in seasoning. A little salt then perfect! My only disappointment which I did for get about because of the service is the grilled scallops. The menu does not mention they are slathered in sauce and I like mine virgin with light lemon. All in all a great meal, we will definitely be back!",

My wife and I eat here pretty regular but, it seems from time to time they try to slip in the notorious sirloin for the fillet.  My question is: ( HOW ) many times do they do this a day / week  to other people???  Yea, and charge the higher price and get away with it.  Some people have good pallets  ( my wife ) and others unfortunately don't. No wonder they make a killing!!!  Fillet's don't have grizzle line running through them.  So, if you eat at this particular Outback........\"BEWARE\"!!!!  Don't get scammed.",

    "text": "My first experience ever eating at Outback Steakhouse wasn't all that great. I was really excited for this location to open. So the wait wasn't all that bad considering they were busy. I think we waited 15-20 min at the most. The server was at our table fast. We ordered the seared ahi which was delicious. My husband ordered the steak salad and I ordered ahi sesame salad. The food was finally here. My husband's salad was missing the steak. How bad of a cook do you have to be to forget the steak on the steakhouse salad????? My salad had the ahi and the lettuce. Nothing else!!! The 5 other ingredients it came with were missing. Red peppers, cilantro, sesame seeds, almonds and sesame vinaigrette. We sat there waiting for out waiter to show up. I even looked up the menu to make sure I wasn't going crazy and my salad was missing all that. He showed up and we showed him the salads. He said I'll be right back. Came back with what looked like a fourth of a steak cut up. Looked like someone was in a hurry and that's all they had so they slap it on the plate. All my stuff was still missing. And his reply was \" we don't have the brightest people working in the kitchen\". Really? Nice of you to talk like that about your coworkers. So after we gathered all the ingredients for our salads they weren't really bad but nothing I would go back for. I know they opened not too long ago but come on get your stuff together. I'd rather eat at miller's ale house across the street.",

    "text": "We have been patrons of the Henderson location for about seven years. Outback is far and above our favorite restaurant, with us visiting about once a month.  Recently, this restaurant relocated.  I agree with the new location in its ease of access and improved parking. It is understandable that the new location has produced a major bump in business however, there has been a large and negative impact on regular customers.    Our wait times have gone from 20-30 minutes to over 90 minutes, call ahead seating has no value in that there is still no reduction in wait times (average 90 minutes), the new staff display a shocking lack of familiarity with the menu,  and the front end staff (understandably overwhelmed) have become curt and indifferent.  As a result, our dining experience has deteriorated dramatically, and has had an impact on our decision as to whether or not to visit Outback for dinner.    Our most recent visit was 8/01, at 6:00PM, table 7, service check 6, and server Jason.  In summation, Outback is no longer our primary choice for our monthly dining experience, and I cannot foresee us returning until management is aware of, and takes action upon, the negatives that have accompanied the relocation.",

My grandson and I got there at 6:30, and had reservations for that time. As usual, we had to wait about 15 minutes, but we have come to expect that, and are fine with it. Our buzzer lit up, and we went to the front podium. As we were standing there, the young lady behind it, said \"She (pointing to a young lady) will take you to your table.\" \"She\" was already standing at the table with the menus. Now, usually, the hostess, will smile at us, and say \"Right this way\" or something to that effect. When we went on to the table, she said nothing, not even a smile. She put the menus down, and left. Now I understand we all have bad days, and perhaps, she was upset about something, but I am old school, and when you have a job, you leave your troubles at home, and go to work with a smile, and a mindset to do a good job. On the other side of the coin, we had a great server. I didn't get his name, but he had an accent. Very positive attitude, very attentive, etc. I realize the hostess thing is trivial to some, but when this old lady goes to spend her money somewhere, she expects good customer service at the very least.",

Needless to say the whole experience was a letdown (it was my first time there) and a waste of $50 dollars (which is way to expensive for a casual dinner, in my eyes).

Ive always liked Outbacks food, when you can get it. So this isnt a review about there decent food but about this particular stores service. During the week they're closed until 4pm. So me and the fam are the first ones in right at 4. We're seated and there we sat for 45 minutes. We got to watch other people eat whle we continued to wait. People who got there much later then us were already eating. We did ask the waitress before we walked out whats going on with our food and she said the food is coming out slowly but surely. The funny thing is her other tables were all eating except us. I honestly think because we got there first they kicked our order to the back. We got up and left. The manager followed us out and asked us if there was anything he could do? Im thinking '\"dont fucking ask me! Tell me what you can do for us!\". Just stupid because you know he wasn't going to offer anything. Richie Cunningham look alike...lol.",

We started out with the aussie frys, can't really go wrong with cheese frys... unless you leave them in the window too long and the cheese gets hard. Like ours did.  I ordered the 3 course meal. I ordered it with cheese potato soup, steak special and 1 side (broccoli), and carrot cake. The soup tasted like a canned soup with added bacon bits. The big problem was the main corse. It was a piece of meat, very tough, raw and cold in the center (I ordered medium rare), and flavorless. I had to salt it myself. The carrot cake was very dense and too sweet for my taste.  My fiance ordered the filet and lobster meal, with mashed potato, and house salad. The salad was about the only thing that was good tonight. Her filet, to my surprise was the SAME piece of meat as I got with my steak special, like really? How is it that we pay over 26$ for the same piece of meat that came in the terrible special. The potatoes were very dry.  The service was actually very good, our waitress corrie tried her best to keep up happy. I will NOT be coming back here, the food here was very bad, not prepaired well.",

So of course managed to get there before the dinner rush even though their was alot of people it wasn't any wait for a table at all. Seated right away, after we picked a table I realize the air is blowing right on us and knowing from experience that this would make for a uncomfortable dinner so I asked for a another table which was fine, other than the fact that I wore a shorter than I normally wear shirt. No midriff just enough for me to be pulling it down every few minutes....    So as considerate of a person that  I am I went to the front and asked to be reseated one more time In a booth/table seat, I'm sure other guest were wonder if a game of musical tables had started and they weren't invited! (they'll thank me later ) It's not like I would have enjoyed someone else's posterior crack during my entire meal why should anyone else!  I usually get an ice tea, I opted to get the flavor added to it which in this case was pomegranate.  I ordered the filet mignon with the all you can eat shrimp, and a dinner salad. The salad was green and the steak was cooked to my liking and the only thing that I was expecting to kick a little more was the cocktail sauce, they call it Volcano sauce...not so much but still good over all.  I saved the best for last, our server Kent. Well I can only say that he was a rockstar! Thanks for making my visit at Outback very enjoyable!!!",

    "text": "In my opinion Outback has improved quite a bit over the last year. I used to call them UpSellBack because no matter what you ordered you were barraged with upsell questions. The last several times I've been here they haven't done that once. Bravo!   I love the steaks. I've really never had a bad steak at this location. I've heard others say they don't cook it how you want it.. Send it back! I would. I order mine Medium Well, and I don't mind it on the Well Done side. I get it how I like it.   Yummy baked potatoes! Crisp, chilled salads with tomatoes, onions, carrots AND cucumbers, really nice salad. I love their Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing. And as long as you have a couple of friends to split it with make sure you order a Bloomin' Onion. Chocolate Thunder From Down Under is an amazing dessert! IF you have the room.   I usually get really good service at Outback. Sometimes it's even superb. On one of my last visits another couple thought it was okay to bring their ever-screaming 2 year old, on a Friday night, at 7 p.m. (Really???) but for the most part the place is quiet and calm.   Sometimes there is a wait, even with a reservation. This is a very busy Outback. I recommend it. Good food, good service, nice atmosphere.",

What really burned my butt was that the waitress shorted  me my change in her favor. What is wrong with them. My husband knew I was tired and didn't tell me bc this has become a pet peeve of mine so he didn't tell me till later. I really want to take someone to the mat on this issue. Why do waitstaff not give coin change? Did I miss some memo on this? I let it go a few times but I'm all done with miss nice now. Don't assume I'm leaving the coin change as a tip. I can't wait to call the next person out who short changes me!! They're a business and should have adequate change for the day. If anything -short yourself and not the customer & give me extra change if you really ran out. Watch out when you go here & check your bill and check your change!!!! Outback is not looking out for you!!! They are truly going to nickel & dime you!",

I don't make a big deal, I explain about my allergies,  and since day one (1), they've been beyond great, the manager even had the kitchen staff scrub down the grill, so I wouldn't be exposed to anything,  and when I was told that, it brought tears to my eyes at the kindness that I was shown. My favorite server Susie is just wonderful,  she knows my order, and if I change it a little,  she doesn't get bothered, and she's just as sweet as can be. I highly recommend this place, because not only the food, but staff make the whole experience enjoyable.",

Aside from that, the steaks are always good, as is most of the food they serve, but my dislike is that I usually end up missing something that I have specifically asked for, and asked again for at pickup. It gets annoying after it keeps happening. So they don't get nearly as much of my business as they used to.",

Our waitress was nicknamed, \"Nay\", but it should have been,  \"Yay!\", because everything was perfect.   Absolutely top notch service, food and drinks and sparkling clean.   No issues or problems and, as I said already, we were all very happy.   I strongly recommend this branch of the restaurant chain.",

    "text": "We stopped in after doing some shopping in the same shopping center as outback and initially we intended to go home and cook but got a little bit lazy, so we stopped in to this location for a satisfying dinner.   Walking in, the hostess staff greeted us and were very friendly. There was no wait so they took us right to our table.   Now here's the real reason I left the review, our server! He came over, greeted us cheerfully and was very kind. He consistently checked in to make sure we were ok and refill our drinks. Put in our order quickly but gave us time to enjoy our appetizer and bread before he mentioned our entrees, and overall perfectly timed his interactions allowing us to flow through conversation, relax and not feel any need to rush through dinner. I cannot have asked for a better first experience at this outback.  I apologize if I completely botch the name because it's very different, but I believe it was Maika (something along those lines on the receipt, when introduced it sounded like \"Mike\".) So sorry, I wish I could remember it correctly, but he was a fantastic server who made our experience a great one!  (If I figure out his name I will definitely update this review to make sure he gets the proper credit.)   I have to comment on the food as well. We started with a blooming onion which came out quick, was very fresh and not heavily breaded which is what I prefer. I feel like I've been to other locations where the breading is so thick, it ruins the whole point of a blooming onion, the onion itself! This app was perfect. The bread came out hot and fresh which was nice as well. I ordered the filet medallions Medium rare with the mash and broccoli, and they were absolutely perfect! The temperature was great, the portion was a good size as well, and the garlic butter on the medallions was delicious. As always their mash is really good and the broccoli was cooked well.  My boyfriend ordered a 9oz steak with the Mac and cheese and I was slightly jealous. That Mac and cheese was so good! Stringy yet creamy, the breading gave it a slight crunch and the pasta itself was al dente. His steak was also cooked very well and he's usually very picky, but he definitely enjoyed it! (One of his first jobs was at outback so he has high standards, lol!)   Overall, our experience was perfect. Exactly what one would want and expect for dinner at Outback. We will definitely be back and hope to have the same server again!",

And I can hear the Outback people say It's because I was 10 or 15 minutes late picking up my takeout now. However True that may be,  it still  doesn't cause chicken to dry out. I know because I used to make this myself and 2 days later it was still edible, moist and delicious.I dare say it was 1 of 3 things re: the kitchen staff that did tho... 1. Overworked 2. under trained 3. Oblivious to caring. And although I can't afford to throw food away...after 2 bites of THAT chicken, it's exactly what I did.",

Our server started out strong , very friendly and service somehow in the middle of service he became less than attentive!  The manager finally came over and told us our food would be out soon, my guess is he forgot to put our order in, I get it, it happens but at least say something.  It took over 45 minutes to get and pay our bill.  I asked for a glass of water, he got side tracked and didn't bring it, the manager stopped by and I asked her.  Very disappointed in the service and tonight's food was mediocre at best.   Disappointing after such a good experience las  Came in for lunch today, the restaurant was pretty full, we were seated immediately at a booth in the bar area.  Service was fantastic and the food was good.  I decided to have to lunch salad and tacos.  The herb aioli with the tacos?  Ahhmazing!  Yum!  The server gave me a small container of it to take home for my leftover taco.  My husband had his usual, the Drovers Platter and was super happy with it!  Yelp check in got us a free Bloomin Onion.  This visit restored our faith on this location!",

It's always worth the wait, especially when it comes to good steak and lobster! Yum!  This time it was to celebrate my brother's birthday, you can never go wrong with steak! Walking in, we were instantly greeted and then seated in a long booth, we had a party of 6 so it was kind of a perfect fit. Maybe next time a table, I'm left handed so I'm always elbowing someone. Our waitress was really nice, very interactive with us and very attentive...I just forgot her name, but she was amazing!!!   You can never go wrong with their bread, its delicious and always warm! We started out with two bloomin onions (over the years they have gotten tinier, but still packed with flavor) and the mushrooms. Both again were extremely delicious!! All the food that we ordered from the pasta, to the steaks, to the burgers and even a Philly cheesesteak were remarkable. You have to try the Mac n cheese, its probably one of the best Mac n cheese's I've ever had and its filling.   We didn't have any room for dessert, but the dessert looked pretty good though! Maybe next time!",

I moved to Henderson several years ago and popped in with my daughter. And though why not give them another chance. They were so busy, but the manager personally made sure we had everything we needed. So, when my girlfriend and I were out and about shopping. We suddenly got hangry while finishing up at Nordstrom rack. And of corse Outback was right there. She didn't want to go, but I talked her into it. We went to the bar, where we were greeted immediately! We told the server we here so hungry. She quickly grabbed the iPad and helped us put in our app order and with less then five minutes brought us the Pinot Grigio we ordered. We were both impressed, considering we went in the middle of lunch rush on a Saturday!!!! The bar seating there is very open, and even has low tables in the bar to accommodate people in wheal chairs! The high top booths were quite comfortable as well. For a casual steak house, this location has hit the nail on the head every time I've come in. Keep up the good service and hospitality!",

Maybe I just missed it before!  I checked in when we first arrived and received a Bloomin Onion ($9.99) for free! My go to meal is Alice Springs Chicken. Sometimes I get fries and add cheese and bacon, to make a little side of cheese fries but today I ordered steamed broccoli as my side. Outback has the best steamed broccoli ever!   Since my last visit, they added little tablets to the tables. You have the option to call your waiter, order more drinks and browse the menu on it. Once the waiter finalizes your check, you pay directly on the tablet and the little light turns green, letting your waiter know that you've paid.   The manager stopped by our table today and checked on us. I always think this is a nice touch because it's rare these days. She was very sweet!",

To be honest if that's your demeanor as a server your working the wrong job. Food was okay, as you can see service sucked even after they honored a special they ADVERTISE! We will probably not return based on the fact I'd never want to be served by that person again and the food was just okay.",

On this occasion we were celebrating a birthday. Contact was made with the manager prior, and we asked if we could bring our own birthday cake.  The manager acknowledged / granted this request, and when the first of our party arrived they were met with several more than helpful employees, we were seated immediately, (despite it being super busy),  and the manager took the cake and stored it in their fridge.  Nicely done.  Our waiter \"Nate\" was out of this world good.  Was on top of everything from answering questions about food, making sure we always had full glasses, and was never pushy for us to leave as cake and presents were open.  Thank you management and Nate.  Your presence definitely added to this night, and you have your customer service skills well in tact.    Our food was better than I remember previously from prior Outback experiences, but when the service is good everything just seems to flow.  I went with a wedge salad with blue cheese, the prime rib, garlic mashed potatoes, and of course the trademark blooming onion. The Mrs. went with the Alice Springs Chicken, and we washed it down with a couple tasty brews.   I must say there was no complaints from either of us on anything we ate. Standard good all the way around.  If I had to suggest one thing.  This location has redecorated their interior to appear a little more modern.  I was always a fan previously of the rustic Australian decor, and if still present mite have been the difference between 5 stars instead of four.  Actually I would be giving 4 and half if that were an option.  All in all a great night from start to finish.  Thank you again to the unnamed manager, and if your ever in here see if you can request \"Nate\" as your server. Thank you outback for making my father in laws 62nd birthday a good experience for all.",

Oh geeze, glad we had a few extra bucks to pay for her not listening, it was 9.00 more per serving on the steak and lobster.

    "text": "You just can't go wrong with Outback.  It's always good, no matter what you get.  I hate places where I feel like I have very few options cause there's only a few good things on the menu.  Suffice it to say, Outback is NOT like one of those joints.  Apps are good, salads are bomb, sides are tasty, seafood is fresh, chicken is delish and the steaks are always on point (as they should be!).   Hubby and I went here for a late dinner last night around 9pm.  We were seated immediately in one of the booths in the bar area and approached by a cool server who bore a somewhat disconcerting resemblance to Wolverine of the X-Men franchise (not kidding at all and when we jokingly asked him about it he said he gets that from pretty much everyone.  awesome...) It was late and we were hungry so we placed our order right away.  We started off with onion petals, which is essentially a mini bloomin' onion.  Perfect for us as we didn't want to spoil our dinner.  We got a loaf of the complimentary bread which is maybe the only thing at Outback that I think isn't anything to write home (or Yelp) about.  Kind of hard, kind of tasteless and the butter they serve with it is either the blandest butter ever or just plain fake... a la margarine.   We both chose salads as one of our sides so those came out next.  Husband with an (anything but) basic side salad (those croutons...I die!) and me with the granddaddy of all salads - the Outback wedge.  Never a better salad was made, people.  Disclosure: it's made with bleu cheese dressing and bleu cheese crumbs are sprinkled on it.  Well I despise bleu cheese, like with a passion, so I got for the wedge minus all the bleu cheese.  So here's the details: a generous lettuce wedge, ranch spilling down all over it, topped with bacon crumbs, red onions and cherry tomatoes.  All of this amazing goodness on top of a juuuuuuust a little bit of some incredibly delicious balsamic vinegar.  It's just heaven, really.  And while I'm mentioning the salads, can someone tell me why and how the ranch at Outback is the best on the entire planet?  No?  Well, I can tell you, then.  I got the scoop last night.  Shhhhh...they include a pinch of cayenne pepper in there to give it a kick!  Genius!  And a-freaking-mazing! Husband got the ribeye and was happy with it other than the fact that it's cooked on the wood grill and the wood that they use gave it a slight woodsy, smokey, lighter fluidy taste.  Eater, beware - if you like to taste meat and not wood and smoke (although in talking to Wolverine it seems that a lot of people do like that), ask them to cook your steak on the flat top, not on the fire grill.   I opted for the sirloin and lobster tail special.  Ok, seriously?  $15.99 for a 6 oz sirloin and a big fat, juicy, flavorful lobster tail?  I am not kidding you.  I got it medium rare (is there ANY other way to cook a steak?!) and it was cooked perfectly.  I was worried about the butter situation (see above) but was relieved when my entree came with a side of warm melted REAL butter.  Dipping that lobster in that butter and savoring every bite was like being reborn, I tell ya.  After the onion petals, the salad and the lobster, I had 2 bites of my steak and just couldn't do any more.  I wanted to, I really did cause it was damn good but I would have been rolled out of there if I had continued.  No loss though, I got my dinner covered tonight! The service was great, the food excellent, atmosphere friendly and we got some real bang for our buck.  $60 for 2 quality steaks is a bargain in my book.   I love Outback, mate!",

So Instead of soda, or a adult beverage, it took me a while to choose water!  And I chose the Sesame  Salad with Salmon, and the onion soup.  Now I could have left out the onion soup, but ohhh well, at least it wasn't the blooming onions......Right?   OMG, everything was so good, I think this is going to be my new go to salad spot.  The manager, came over and checked on us.   I can't remember her name.  But that salad was so big, I couldn't eat it all.  And I think it was only 600 calories for all of that!  So if this is what eating healthy is about!  I'm on board with that.  Overall, a great experience with this location!  I will be back for another salad, even if it's to go.",

We ordered the VICTORIA'S FILET MIGNON & LOBSTER, which was most definitely not a filet and the lobster was the size of a shrimp. Very disappointing. The side dishes were delicious and so was the complementary bread and butter. Customer service was great, as soon as we pulled up, someone came out with our order. I appreciated that. I wouldn't recommend curbside to go but maybe dine-in would serve freshly made steaks.",

There are multiple different types of cuts of meat to choose from, so there's something for everyone. The meat can be served in three different portion sizes for the majority of the menu, from 6oz to 16oz! The variety of the menu really makes it hard to choose which one to get, but regardless of your decision it's hard to go wrong with any of the selection!   We got the option to choose two sides, and went with a baked potato as well as the house Mac n cheese. If you get anything at outback, GET THE MAC N CHEESE!! It was out of this world and my boyfriend and I both agreed that we have never had Mac n cheese that good before.   The service was so great too! Our waiter made sure that everything was to our liking and brought out as many bread servings as we could eat! It was a great night, and extremely reasonably priced if you order accordingly! We will definitely be back again for more!",

Service was excellent, both the Bartender who served me and my husband while we waited for our guests to arrive; and Amanda the waitress.  Food was very good.  Prices, as we have already established, were terrific.  I had fish tacos and they were very good.  I've had better but I've had worse.  And they were generous in size.  I ate 1.5 of the two tacos.  KoKo the dog got chicken breast and half of a fish taco, as two of us were unable to finish our meals.  Can't remember the last time I went to an Outback Steakhouse, but I will definitely come back more often.  Loved the Blooming Onion, of course.

    "text": "EEEKKK!  So I don't normally leave reviews for places like this.  I mean we all know what we're getting when we come to a chain right?  I promised myself I would NEVER EVER come back here.  The last time I was here (maybe 2017), I had the WORST server and my meal was terrible.  It could not be made right.  And the manager did nothing to make it right.  However, my employees love to give me Outback gift cards and instead of sitting at the bar and drinking that money, my mom asked if I could take her to dinner.  And I can say I was pleasantly surprised.  This experience was much closer to the one I used to have as a kid growing up in a smallish town where a chain like this is where we'd go for a \"fancy\" weekend/special occasion dinner.    Greeted immediately and given a wait time that was actually accurate.  Our server was quick and knowledgeable.  The food looked and tasted great.  Steak was cooked to the correct temperature.  Drinks were kept full.  The manager touched our table.  The bathroom was clean.  Everything was just right.    Definitely will come back to use any more gift cards that swing my way.",

I made a reservation for party of 7 and later added a high chair for this late welcome toddler whom my mom decided to tag her along....the foods were amazing. the chief however did over cooked the birthday boy steak but in no time, they brought out the perfect medium rare steak for him. sorry for being the loud table in the dining area, our Asian family can be loud around others but no one complains or say anything. it was a nice family gathering on a Easter Sunday evening. I just wonder why I never dine here. the prices for the foods were also excellent, great place to eat with a large family.. especially when one member pays for the whole bill. it's a good thing we came to the right place for steak & lobster. our server, Kelly was so sweet and attentive to our needs. thank you Kelly for being our server that evening. I'll definitely will be coming back here to try other entrees and that blooming onion! so delicious! I never have them before but it is a must to order or check in for a free blooming onion that's on Yelp right now. it's amazing!",

We got it free, amazing recovery from that, no big deal.... But this time it was different. My mom had lobster that smelled like ammonia (why does everything bad happen to my mom? Poor her!). I love the smell of fresh seafood and I gagged, one of the managers blamed us and said she smelled it and it was fine. Later, she ordered a mashed potato, and guess what? The same manager gave us a baked potato instead, \"no you said mashed potato you must have said it wrong, not my fault. Sorry.\" The only good thing was our waitress, her name was Susan and she did everything correctly. We ended up getting our meal free, but tipping Susan about $30! Always ask for Susan!!!!",

But there is absolutely nothing available for vegans. So I sit there with a bowl of sauteed mushrooms and go home hungry. Not very progressive, Outback!",

I called outback earlier that day and made sure that it was ok to bring in my service dog. When me and my family sat down at our table I was told that by the manager Doug that my dog had to be somewhere else and that he needed to go. Which made me very nervous and uncomfortable which made my anxiety act up and caused me to shake uncontrollably because I was told that my service dog couldn't be with me next to me (which he sat quietly and didn't bother any customers or waiters). Even the man in the table next to me had to console me and tell me that the manager was out of line.   I will never come back to this place of business and I will be sure to let friends and family know how horrible Doug was to me and my family. The way he spoke to me was sick and disgusting as a person with special needs.",

I ate that 22 ouncer like a boss!   The side that I chose that came with my dinner was not too shabby either. The baked sweet potato had honey butter, brown sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on it . Oh yes! It's a winner with me too!   Wait time - hardly if you book online and get on the waitlist.  All you have to do is fill out info and time you plan on arriving [<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outback.com%2FRestaurant%2FLocations%2FNV%2FHenderson%2FHenderson&s=a8bec6cf5b759fa7580bd41cdd5a524b38083393e7f1994f16f638a8d694e862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">outback.com/Restaurant/L...</a> ] your name is then put in cue on the waitlist in order of real time. Booked 1/2 hour before arrival at 6:15 just as we were finishing up shopping.  Arrived at 6:15, checked in with the host in front that had the tablet. The waiting area was full, but our pager lighted up no less than 5 minutes.  Location - I like they moved here on Stephanie/Warm Springs. More convenient and easier for my friends to meet up here. We've had multiple dinners here already.   Vibe -  It's casual, unpretentious. Local scene.  Family friendly. I like dining at the outdoor patio area. It seemed less noisy.   Service has been great every visit here so far.  No complaints. Steaks are made to order so complain to the person in your party who orders their steak well done for the longer wait.  Price - spending under $100 for two steak dinners ..a freaking bargain.   To think I blew off dining here for the longest time when someone suggested we come here because it's a chain restaurant. I was uber surprised that my experience here was just as good as having dinner at some of the more upscale steakhouses around town. So say yes to Outback! And go for that 22oz Ribeye!",

    "text": "Outback my foot. More like out in the backyard. I have serious doubts of their connection to Australia. I didn't hear a single Aussie accent. Nobody even bid me a \"g'day mate.\" For shame. You know they don't even serve kangaroo meat here? What kind of a place is this? Would it be so much to ask for some didgeridoo music? Even Rolf Harris or AC/DC would be appropriate. Something other than the kitsch of a few photos of the Australian Outback and cutesy restroom signs (i.e. Sheilas). Shake my head.  All kidding aside, my dinner tonight was pretty good. I was brought a small loaf of complimentary bread and whipped butter. That was quite good and though I wanted to save half I was un able to do so. It was gone before I realized I had eaten it all. I was also brought a complimentary Bloomin' Onion. Not that it is free for everyone all the time. Outback currently has a promotion where they offer a free Bloomin' Onion on the Monday after Kevin Harvick finishes in the top 10 during the most recent NASCAR race. This promotion is why I came in in the first place. For my meal I ordered chicken tacos with grilled asparagus. It was all pretty good.   There were a few issues with the food despite the overall goodness of it. The asparagus was not properly trimmed of the most fibrous portion of the stalks. I did that myself. I understand this is a restaurant and time wise it is not really feasible to snap each stalk individually so I'll look past this. My Bloomin' Onion seemed both over cooked and under cooked simultaneously. It was dark and nearly burned on the outter peddles but nearly raw in the core. That did not stop me from eating about half and saving the rest for later.  At last, I was done with my meal and my bill came. This is where my evening went down hill. I ordered an iced tea and was given a refill. I was charged for two drinks. Apparently there are no free refills here. Irritating of you ask me. Then I saw the $1 charge for upgrading to the asparagus. My tacos were supposed to come with fries. I was told, and I quote, \"I know the menu says it comes with fries but really you can order any of these sides. The grilled asparagus is really good.\" I was led to believe I had an option of sides. I didn't realize I would be charged extra. I feel decieved. Dinner should not be a deceptive venture. Not cool guys. Not cool.",

My parents started coming here a lot, mostly during lunch and would rave about how good it was and I joined them a few times and would have to agree.  The place is nice looking inside and the food is pretty well priced and tasty and they have their calories listed which is awesome.  To be fair, I've never gotten a steak or lobster or anything \"fancy\" here because I don't see it as that kind of restaurant.  I see it as a place where I can get a good sandwich or burger or some tacos and enjoy a nice lunch out.  I could even see myself coming and sitting at the bar and having a few drinks because it looks so inviting, as sad as that sounds.  This place has taught me to not knock it until I have tried it.",

Our bloomin onion came out burnt to a crisp and I felt bad but I had her take it back. She genuinely felt terrible about it even though it wasn't her fault she was so apologetic about it. The manager Mike, came by right away and offered us another bloomin onion but I declined. He insisted on comping us a dessert, which we took him up on.  On probably one of their busiest days of the year, we still had an ok experience at outback minus the wait time and irritated hostess.

    "text": "I have been wanting to return to Outback since the new Henderson location opened.  We used the \"click thru seating\" to get on the waiting list. It was showing about a 30-35 minute wait. We were seated within about 2-3 minutes of our arrival. The service started out great with our waitress coming right over to take our drink order. The drinks also arrived quickly. After that, it started to taper off.  We ordered the bloomin onion and I went with the prime rib and house salad. The onion was delivered and after eating less than half of it we were done. It just wasn't as good as we remembered. It was quite a while before we got our salads or saw our waitress. I was just going to ask for her when the salads came out.   Again quite a delay for the entrees. The prime rib was pretty good, not much fat which was nice. It was just very thin. I did not care for the garlic mashed at all. It was overpowered with some herbs that masked the garlic flavor. The whole meal was also very salty. Again the waitress disappeared for a while so we had to get someone else to find her for our bill. It was about $70 which just seems really high for what you get here.",

My steak was very very good....given pricing etc. Service is attentive albeit good for people who don't eat out...as in artificial friendly. But it was very good as for all the points one wants in service quality.  My steak was very tender, very tasty and very good....and I am not easy to please. Best of all, reasonably priced. Outback is defying my stereotypes of a chain.....at least in the food quality. Great value...good taste....not gourmet....but then I get that at home.",

That being said, the service is a little on the slow side.  I waited awhile to get my drink order, and even longer to place my lunch order.  The salads keep getting smaller and smaller.  it used to be the best salad in the game, but the portion size is very small now.  I ordered an 8 oz Filet medium well, and it was pretty much well done.  I didn't send it back or complain.  I just asked for some Lea & Perrins to put on it, and that took forever to get me a bottle of that.  And the baked potato looked great, but only half of it was edible.  The rest was not cooked.  I did like the new Castaway Cocktail.  It made everything else bearable.  I was already having a pretty rotten day, I really just wanted a good meal.  That's why I went here.  It was decent, but not quite the Outback standard that I've had in the past.",

Our food sever was off the chart. How he kept up his sense of humor, enthusiasm and energy levels is beyond my belief. He helped us with our dining choices and was so knowledgeable about every thing on your menu. Checking on us to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. Our soft drinks were never empty, he kept them topped off,which is very rare in restaurants these days.Seems you have to always ask for refills in other places.I sincerely appreciate your outstanding work and customer service. I did take notice that the manager (Jason) was very visible and talked to every table, making sure that all customers were getting the service and quality of food they deserve. Jason is doing an outstanding job running this establishment. He has an OUTSTANDING  staff!  Great Management.! What an awesome experience! Food was WONDERFUL!    I cannot wait for the Outback to open on Stephanie Street in Henderson, which is closer to my home and I heard will be open for lunch.. (yea) Instead of frequenting your place once a month it looks like it will be once or twice a week! Thank You Again Service was stupendous!",

We have visited twice for dinner, once early in the week soon after they opened and recently on a Friday.  The first visit was barely two stars, with slow, indifferent service and incorrectly cooked steaks. Our second visit was better, but still below expectations. How is it a steak restaurant can't cook a medium steak? Still, much better than first visit and maybe worth another try.",

Also I had asked for veggies as one of my sides and I got the baked potato so had to wait for my veggies a few more minutes after my meal got there. BUT my biggest complaint was that our server poured me my 2nd glass of wine, which was a different type of wine into the same glass that I already had been using. That is such poor Restaurant etiquette that I really wish I would have said something. Food was pretty good. I tried their lamb for the first time. It had a good flavor but it was very fatty.",

We wife went to the bathroom...I perused the menu...my wife returned and I went to the bathroom, about 7-8 minutes passed before we were even greeted with a \"I'm your waitress I'll be right with you.\" We subsequently ordered drinks and an appetizer. The appetizer came out first. Before the drinks, before the bread...  The food was fine. I mean its a chain steakhouse. I got exactly what I expected I would get. I'm not going to complain about quality here, food was par for the course.  My drinks (a water and a soft drink) each remained empty for about 75% of my visit. I got one offer for a refill.    Then we got the bill. I'm not sure when the soft drinks jumped up to $3.50 a piece, but that was a little absurd.   My wife and I used to eat about once a month at Texas Roadhouse, which was located in the same shopping center as this Outback before it shut down after a slip and fall lawsuit. Our order is always the same, the house special, a six ounce steak with two sides. My wife gets one, I get one. We pay about $25 at Texas Roadhouse. Our bill here for the same two specials was $39. Between the increased drink prices and the higher steak prices...I miss Texas Roadhouse. They are miles above this place in both value and service.",

Service was great the food was outstanding and we only had a three minute wait when we came in. No complaints here at all.  I had the New York strip steak-perfectly done the way I like it charred on the outside, medium rare on the inside. Steak was tender juicy and ample. Loaded baked potato was great.  Diner 2 had the baby back ribs and she said they were the best ribs she had in a long time. They sure looked good. Diners 3 and 4  had to Tilapia with crab sauce and they too said the fish was perfectly done and moist.   Diner 5 had filet mignon and while  fillet mignon can be somewhat dry hers  was not. The blooming onion that we started out with and shared was as always outstanding. Our waitress Nicole did a great job of taking care of us and kept her eyes on us to make sure there was nothing we needed.  Oh, by the way call ahead seating is a must or you could face an hour to an hour and a half wait. No complaints on this trip ...hope future trips are as good. If you haven't tried Outback steakhouse in Henderson I'd suggest giving it a try.",

I had as a side, tortilla soup...I wouldn't call that a tortilla soup, it was some sort of mushy stuff with some tortilla chips, sprinkled with cheap cheddar. The main course, the 6 ounce sirloin was caked with salt and forced cooked for the look of it. A good steak requires little condiments and slowly cooked to perfection. The only thing cooked well was my side steamed vegetables. I would consider this restaurant at the same level as a cheap fast food restaurant.",

He kept my coffee cup full and my husbands ice tea glass filled. Kept the unlimited shrimp coming. Everything was 5 Star service.

Best French onion soup anywhere, awesome steaks and great sides (love the mac & cheese!). Only minor complaint is the drinks are a little small resulting in multiples orders... or maybe I'm just an alcoholic.   All in all this place is utterly reliable. I prefer the old Outback design, they are building these new ones in a single big dining room, I like the old divided rooms more because they are quieter and a little more comfortable, but the food still rocks.   With Outback you can be sure you're going to get good food at a good price with good service. Unlike other chain-type places that have turned into absolute catastrophic toilets (Applebee's) Outback has kept up with standards and I always look forward to eating there.",

Their reservation system isn't reservations. They just put on the waiting list early. So we showed up at 5:40 and checked in. Since we were listed for 6 they said our time started then and would be less than 25 minutes.   Well an hour and 20 minutes later we received our beverages at our table located in the bar area.  As for the food. My asparagus were burned and tasted like char. The filet was good but as for the steak combo one of us ordered well ridiculous. Australians would be embarrassed that this represented Australia. The steak was so small it more resembled a chicken strip.   It was a horrible experience and we won't bet back to any Outback Steakhouse!",

    "text": "My neighbor and I went there today to have lunch. Well we should have know when our waiter came to us after waiting for our appetizers to arrive that something was wrong. First, he did not even notice that we had no silverware. So we had to dip our bread into the butter and spread it around with our fingers. The hostess was less then thrilled to be there because the way we were greeted and seated was like she was doing us a favor. Anyway, our waiter comes to us and tells us that they are redoing our blooming onion because the first one came out looking like poop. And they did not want to serve it to us so we said ok and waited. This is when I had to ask for silverware. He told us that the manager was going to bring it to us. She arrived later with our blooming onion and asked us if this was ok and we said we don't know because we never seen one before let alone tasted one so we were not sure if it was ok. We also the told here we never saw the first one. This was sign #2 that this was not going to go well. My French onion soup came and that was on the warm side so I kind of let that slide. Well when our meal showed up it was horrible. My sweet potato was cold and the glob of butter would not melt let alone all that cinnamon on top of it and on the side of the plate. It looked a mess. My meat was cold and it looked liked someone took bites out of it and then tried to cover it up with gravy. It looked like it was served before. You could tell by the broccoli that it was over cooked just by the color of it. The same was said for my friend that had the beef with the Marsala sauce. Both were cold as well as the risotto. We talked with the manager and I told her that we were done and that there was no apology that could make me want to come back and she needs to talk to her staff about the words they choose to describe their food because poop was just the deal breaker for me. So I really don't know what is so good about Outback Steakhouse. The service for me was not what it is cracked up to be. Also the owners name is about the entrance to the restaurant. My one comment to the owner is take your name down. Your staff just made an embarrassment of your name as a franchise owner.",

Next day, my wife called me up all angry because I ate her entree from the night before, which I did NOT because I value a happy life!  Somehow, it had not made it's way into our \"to-go box\". I called Outback and spoke to their manager there. His name was Dan and he was a real nice guy. The customer service was fantastic, I couldn't believe it! I'll definitely return since I was really satisfied with everything.  Thanks again Dan",

He was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, always made sure our drinks were full, engaged us in friendly conversation, made sure our order was accurate and although he didn't personally make our food, his efficiency and timely manner with our food was wonderful. It was an exceptional dining experience and we will be requesting him from now on because we KNOW it will be great every time. He deserves major kudos and recognition for his hard work and dedication to serving his customers with exceptional service.   Our porterhouse was cooked and seasoned perfectly, our bloomin' onion was crispy and very tasty, our salads were crisp and refreshing, and the ice tea was good. We love eating at this Outback and usually it's \"ho-hum\" experience that you would expect from any eatery but as the above paragraph stated, it was just wonderful this time.  If you visit this location, ask for Cody. He's spectacular.",

The entire team that serviced us were excellent. Didn't have to ask for refills, before we even asked for extra anything, they were asking us if we needed it.

We had our 2 yr old with us and the hostesses were very welcoming and accommodating.  We were told there would be a 5 min wait time which was surprising because it was super busy.  We were seated very quickly and although, as I said before they were extremely busy the waitress helped us by taking our order for our child first, which was amazing because she was already cranky.  Lol. Anyways we were also greeted with a few managers which I thought was excellent,  I work in customer service management as well and that is something I really do appreciate.

    "text": "I wasn't a huge fan of Outback in the past, but lately I find myself dining here quite a bit. Perhaps they worked on in their menu more since, but I do find the food more flavorful now. This particular location on Stephanie has really good service and the food quality is consistent.  Our server tonight, Justin, was friendly and patient. I never felt rushed and enjoyed my dinner in a relaxed environment. The center cut sirloin was surprisingly juicy and tender. I prefer my steak medium rare and I think with this particular cut, it benefited by not being dried out. The green beans was buttery and the sweet potato was a fluffy orange cloud. I think they grill the sweet potato though because the outside skin looks like it has grilled marks. Tasty nonetheless. I opted not to have everything on it-meaning you could add brown sugar and butter on top, so I had it plain. Honestly, it was naturally sweet so I'm glad I didn't sugar it up. The 22 ounce rib eye is a really good choice too. I recommend getting the steaks Outback style, so they sear it in the flat top versus just wood grilled. I find it more flavorful and seals in the juices.  Served with a side of creamy horseradish sauce is a plus for me as the creamy style is not so strong. You have the option of raw horseradish sauce, but I'm not brave enough for that. The broccoli cheese is a premium side so there was a dollar up charge. It has a garlic butter sauce on it too which was tasty.   I've had the loaded potato soup there as well and I would get it again. Their famous onion blossom can be good, but is generally a tad too greasy for me. The ice cream dessert with a brownie in it was delicious and enough to share for two. Overall, I have had consistent service here  and the food has been pretty good. Sometimes things can change for the better. Glad I gave Outback another try.",

    "text": "1. This location does not have the TV advertised $15.99 steak and lobster special. The \"special\" here is the same thing for $18.99. Not cool. We asked about it and our server said that the location was bought out by ____ company, was no longer a franchise, and that might be the reason. I know they DID have the annual $15.99 special here a year ago. Not anymore. Maybe they can change the name to Outback Stakehouse to differentiate themselves from the real locations.  2. The 15/20/25% tip suggested amounts seemed wrong. I calculated it, and apparently, this location thinks people should tip on the tax as well as the check. Um, the tax is paid to the government, not the server. Tips are calculated before the tax! Ticked me off.  3. The food was good. The steak needed a bit more seasoning, but the lobster was perfect. Our server was good too, and did a great job getting our food to us even though she was busy. But, I just can't get over the first two issues.",

She made sure we had everything we needed and our drinks were always refilled. The manager came by to ask us how everything was as well. The food was DELICIOUS, my steak was cooked exactly as I ordered and Michelle made sure my son got a birthday sundae and song even though I just mentioned in passing that tomorrow is his birthday - will definitely be back. So pleased!!!",

    "text": "Well dang. I have always liked their food but a few serious things went wrong today and sadly I probably will not be back. The waitress that served me today continually interrupts your conversation to blurt out \"How is everything?\" What happened to the day they would clear dishes (she walked away without taking the dirty dishes with her) and make their presence known but not interrupt people while they are deep in discussion? Topic for next staff meeting: don't interrupt customers conversations while they are dining. Approach quietly, wait to be recognized, then speak. Or slowly cruise around so if anyone needs something you are available, but don't just barge into someone's conversation \"IS IT GOOD?\" ugh :(  Lastly, there was a hair in my salad. It was at the very bottom and it was odd because my friend and I were just talking about how the salad dressing was at the bottom .. like someone put the salad dressing in first then put everything on top of it. Low and behold, I am looking into my dish and there is a crazy looking hair.  Ugh. Pic attached.  I let the server know. She apologized and took it away. I was in shock so I just sat quietly, you know you start to look around like is there hair in my other food? Or drink? LOL  Then a manager comes up, saying his name is Doug. He apologized and let me know my meal charge has been removed from the tab. He says we can get any dessert we want, no charge. We said it was okay and he said if we needed anything else to let him know. We talked briefly about hair nets and Doug said everyone there wears them in the kitchen including beard nets, but our server had long hair that was not in a net so it kind of confused me.  We paid the bill and left. We didn't take him up on a free dessert. They removed the charge for my lunch off the bill, but we still paid for my guests lunch and both of our non-alcoholic beverages.  I don't see myself going back there.",

Salads to start were both fresh. The prime rib with baked potato was done perfectly. He couldn't resist the \"San Francisco\" wine that had a cute saying - just can't remember what it was.

We had bone in ribeye and prime rib, prime rib actually ran out (table next to us didn't get any). Ribeye had a great crust and was cooked perfectly, the garlic butter on top was tasted good (it oddly didn't melt though). The macaroni is worth the upgrade, creamy, cheesy, crunchy. Their gin cocktail was satisfying and not too sweet. Downside/upside was the onion peel appetizer. It's only $5 and probably the left over from the blooming onion so a lot of it was over fried. Considering we didn't want the full fried onion appetizer this was definitely in the plus category. The restaurant was very modern and clean, will come back!",

We ordered the biggest porterhouse that they have as well as the steakhouse mac & cheese mashed potatoes and a side of grilled shrimp. Everything was cooked perfect and service was very good just wish the shrimp were a little bigger. Also ordered the steakhouse salad which is my favorite it is their pecan blue cheese salad with sliced sirloin steak the delish.

    "text": "This was my first time eating at an Outback Steakhouse and I must say it wasn't that good of an experience. We made reservations but still had to wait. Once we were escorted to our table they still had dirty dishes on it from previous customers. The table wasn't wiped, it was sticky. Our waiter had a great personality but wasn't a very good server. He didn't ask how I wanted my steak cooked. Instead we had to ask him if I could have it medium well, when he assumed and wrote down I wanted medium rare. I don't think it was that great of an experience.  The only good thing about it was the food and dinner combo.",

The staff had not come out to the car after 5 minutes after the allotted time so we had to go pay inside, which was not a big deal. All in all -- it was good! Not quite a 5-star experience or food (the steak was nicely seasoned, perfectly cooked, but really pretty tough), but a very nice 4-star Sunday night dinner \"in\"!",

The food at Outback is consistently ok. Nothing amazing, but good enough and affordable for what you get. I never have issues with my steak not being cooked properly, nor the quality of the meat served.   It is the service here that has been lackluster for me.. examples of what I mean: having to ask for the complimentary bread, having the server forget what sides I ordered with my steak, longer than should be necessary waits for drink refills.    I am a huge fan of the Curbside to Go service though! I can order my dinner from my computer, drive to Outback in my pajamas, and within just a couple minutes a friendly employee will bring my order out to me while I relax in my car.   I have utilized this take out service a few times now, the website makes it very easy to get your order precisely how you want it. And being able to sit on my couch and eat a steak I didn't cook, while in my pajamas is wonderful.",

I looked around and he was nice to everyone I specially liked that he was very nice to an elderly couple next to my booth. The food was nothing to cry about the stake was just perfect specially since I have found out how hard is to have medium/rare since they either come out medium to well done, definitely not what I asked for, even the baked potato and vegetables were good as they were not under cooked or over cooked. Overall from the service to the food it was excellent I even got a soda refill to go. And they now serve lunch at 11am, hurray!!",

The best part is I can order it online and then bump to Tupac, tweeze stray eyebrows and wait for them to bring it out to my car. Now that's VIP service playa!  They have a soup and salad combo deal for $9.99. Plus tax and tip I'm back on the road for just under $15. It also comes with a loaf of that unhealthy, but super fucking good honey wheat bread. The portion of the soup has gotten smaller over the years, but still seems to be the perfect portion to satisfy me. My favorite is the Creamy Onion, but will settle for the Potato if I have to. The salad is my favorite simple dinner salad around. Cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, cheddar cheese, olives and garlicky soft, buttery amazing croutons. Top it all off with their homemade Ranch dressing which I'm convinced drizzled on bubble wrap or a hairy elbow it would still rock my universe. This meal is by no means healthy, but it is my comfort meal that doesn't leave me bloated for days. Especially enjoy it during hoodie season.   Beautiful salad porn take one: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zEOfVGv6DeprEzmFYMFhXA?userid=Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA#yHDt1iDFgHvGdrfwhFYQ6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/zEOf...</a>  Online Ordering.  Only problem is they don't always have the soup you want even though the online system lets you order it. I don't like this. They need to fix this shit. The guys and girls that bring it out to your car are always cool and make sure you have your full order. In return I am nice to them.  Yes, 15 bucks is a little steep for a freakin' salad and cup of soup, but it's good for the soul and I don't have to do tons of social interaction to get it thanks to the online ordering and curbside pickup. I can go home and eat it in my Underoos and legwarmers and get my Honey Boo Boo on. #fuckingwinning.",

Within seconds of him leaving the table another gentleman came over and apologized and asked if I still wanted to work on the current steak I had. Me being me I just couldn't continue eating it. So he took my steak and I asked him to leave my side dish. A few minutes later a different gentleman walked out with a new steak and a new side!!

We asked here about a few different choices as we were torn on what we wanted to try that we had not tried in the past. She was engaging and offered her opinion on the food. She also gave her suggestions on some of the drink specials they had. We both ordered a cocktail and our meal. The food was great, My husband ordered the talipia with lump crab(which he had before) and he said it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I had chicken with Monterrey jack cheese mushroom and bacon(forgot the name) which the waitress said was delish and it was, the chicken was moist and had a nice honey mustard sauce on it.

They recently moved to this location from the Green Valley / Sunset location which was a good move because it was hard to find being off the street.  The family decided they wanted steak, and we have a lot of history with Outback, so why not.  When our family goes to the outback we have 3 traditions: Bloomin Onion, Foster Draft and Steak. The bloomin Onion is worth the trip alone.  We were very lucky as we were seated in a booth patrolled by one of the best waiters I've known.  He was better than waiters I've had a 5 star places like Double Eagle.  He was informative but didn't talk too much, and he emphasized that we are there to relax and enjoy the food.  I feel like most of the waiters today see customers as burdens because they let how busy they are take over their attitude.  He did not give us that vibe at all.  The food was way better than I remember.  I had a salad, herb encrusted prime rib and a fully loaded baked potato.  All of it was excellent.  The salad was crisp and fresh, the prime rib was hot and tender and the baked potato was soft and packed with flavor.  We also treated ourselves to the Oreo mini-milkshake.  It was so good it will be added to the outback tradition as #4.",

Our food literally sat in front of us while we stared at it with no silverware and no one was proactive about solving the problem. Our food orders were wrong, refills were very delayed, and to top this whole experience off it was my dad's birthday dinner :( The response at the end of the night was \"sorry, I'll try better next time\" and barely anything was discounted. We were so excited for this location to open, we literally counted down the days and chose it as the birthday location but we seriously recommend you going to the location on sunset and not this one.

Dinner started with a loaf of the brown bread I had such an obsession with in my childhood. It was way smaller than my husband or I could remember and sad looking. Husband tried it and said it has gone downhill. Bummer but I wasn't here to eat bread anways.. I was here for the freaking meat and crab!  6 oz sirloin + 1/2 lb of snow crab + potato (I subbed green beans) for $13.99. I was scared the sirloin would be tough or the crab legs would be brown and mushy like the ones at Hooters. Nope, it was all fabulous! The sirlon was way better than it should have been - arguably the best \"cheap\" restaurant steak I've had in my life. DUH, it doesn't compare to Cut or Carnevino, but it was an insane value for the price. The crab legs were of the \"good buffet\" level quality (ie M resort, not Rio ). Very pleased with them as well. Served prescored with melted butter..YUM. Green beans were delicious as well.   Sadly this amazing steak/crab combo is \"limited time only\". BOO. During it's limited time I might just become a frequent visitor to the Outback - a deal this good is too good to last !",

    "text": "Okay, so as part of my new years resolution I have been trying to eat better, more salads, less red meat etc....It sucks but oh well.  Anyways, I had a craving for steak and we were right next to an Outback, oh well why not, sure it's not going to be great, but really, outback is the McDonalds of the Steak world, nothing amazing but you know what you are going to get.  Which pretty much sums it up, the wife had a chicken salad, I had the sirloin.  Steak was cooked to perfection, potato had way to much salt on it as ever, but nothing really negative about the meal.",

    "text": "Thoroughly disappointing. We went on a Thursday evening about 5:30. Totally packed. We elected to sit out on their patio. Great choice. Only good choice of the evening. Comfortable, sevice was good. Food was lousy. 3 of us all unhappy. Tried to order the prime rib. Only comes medium well??? What kind of steakhouse doesn't have rare/medium rare??? It came out looking so well done it was awful. Overdone, looked like it had been sitting around for days. I ordered the bone out ribeye, medium rare. It came out like shoeleather, well done. Horrible. Guest ordered the sirloin and coconut shrimp. The steak was total grissle and the shrimp was flavorless.  The whole meal was a waste of time. You spend $100 for dinner, you expect more. Won't be back here for awhile. VERY POOR FOOD, STAY AWAY!!",

    "text": "Had a great experience tonight here at the outback. My wife and daughter are celiac so eating out is difficult and frustrating at times. As a treat for the end of the school year we decided to go out and enjoy a steak. When my daughter's salad was delivered we found a crouton in the side of ranch. Not a big deal typically but for my daughter and wife a major health concern. We did not make a big deal at all about it and simply asked if we could get another side of ranch. We were pleasantly surprised at how gracious and concerned they were and how anxious they were at making it right. They went WAY above and beyond anything they needed to gain our trust. I can't overstate how great they were and how gracious their manager was. Amazing. We will definitely be back. We did not make any demand or complaint but they worked hard to win us over. Thank you so much outback on Stephanie. Great food and great management.",

If you're looking for any sense of refinement, it's missing here. Leftover food on the table from whomever sat there last. Dishes were greasy, not the food. The actual plates. They don't want to take your dirty silverware for the next course.  Food is mediocre at best. The were constantly sweeping the floor by our table the whole meal, I hope no dirt or dust flew up. Just gross.  It's been 8-10 years since I've been to an Outback. I hope never to return.",

I had a party of 9 booked and they told me they can take us in at 7 but maybe 20-30 min after we check in bcoz its a busy day..honesty on the phone is awesome! Don't make any promises if you can't deliver! We checked in at 7pm and sat down at 7:30..they use a tablet and have all the info in it! Cool! The server was awesome!  She was attentive and helped in our choices...the food? Well they ran out of their steak and all you can eat shrimp special!!!!why did you say I give them 5 stars? It's because when I complained, the actual manager emailed me back and explained the situation....that to me is customer service! The food we had as an alternative was good and the bread was awesome as usual...will I come back? Yes!",

I still like it there though and I'll proly just steer away from the onion",
