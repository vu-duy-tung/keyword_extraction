It took some time for a server to even acknowledge us. Once she did we at least got water quickly but that was the extent of it. Waited some time before she came back and took our order. I had the fish and chips and the oil used to fry both was definitely old. Both tasted stale and were very dry. I did not finish my fish. As far as \"endless\" fries are concerned they gave us very few to start with and only brought one refill. Had a milkshake that we had \"split\" which means they give you two child sizes for the price of a full one. Overall not impressed and will not return to this location.",

We were there at lunch time and they were not what I would call super busy. We placed our order from a very inattentive waitress. She seemed to have been given too many tables to wait on. All 5 of them. Lol  2. We sat what felt like forever for our burgers and fries. When a table that was sat a good 15 minutes after us received their food before ours.  3. Never offered more fries 4. I make better tasting burgers on my backyard BBQ. The meat was just meh... 5. Food arrived cold not even warm. I swear it had been done and forgot to be ran out to us.  6. A take out box wasn't offered we had to ask for one.  7. Literally the waitress took our order and brought us a check. She never stopped over to ask if our food was delicious because I had taken 2 bites and was done you I would think she would have wondered if something was wrong. Like say mayonnaise, I am not a fan and asked for it not to be on the burger but it was slathered with it. A food runner brought the food out, another lady cleared and refilled drinks. Waitress was useless, just sayin!   So disappointed!",

We arrived and were greeted very boisterously and taken to our booth. Man, was this place poppin' on a Sunday night. Super super busy, but it didn't impede service whatsoever.  I ordered the Bonzai Burger (just like old times) with a cup of clam chowder. My fella got the All American Burger (he's a sucker for a burger with an egg on top). My burger was cooked just as I had requested and it tasted just as I had remembered. It was a little lacking in teriyaki sauce, but it had just the right amount of all the ingredients. My clam chowder was pretty tasty as well. Nothing gourmet obviously, but it quenched my soup craving for the evening and for that I was appreciative. My fella enjoyed his burger quite a bit as well. We're both big fans of the endless refills on steak fries available. Not that we took full advantage of that, but it's good in theory.Try the fries with some honey mustard. Yum!  The service was fast and extremely friendly and I always keep an eye out for the actual \"Red Robin\" to come out on weekends. That always makes me smile.   All in all, good experience.",

Drinks were not automatically refilled and I had to try to \"flag down\" a server, it took a long time before we got drinks. They said bottomless fries and coleslaw, but be prepared to wait a long time to even get a replacement side.  The tablet on the table is sneaky, you might press on a game and there is no confirmation screen. You will be billed for it if you don't look closely.  When you pay with the tablet, it's best to choose the email option if you want your receipt. I chose the printed receipt and after a bit of a wait, nothing came out. I don't want to \"flag down\" another server and wait another lifetime to get my receipt.   It wasn't very busy, but if you want to come here, perhaps find a less busy time or try your luck at another location.",

I would recommend coming here for lunch not dinner.   The food is average although the last time we came we enjoyed their parmesan fries so I ordered it again only to find out they changed the recipe it was better before. They also say us in the back which at the time obviously had 1 server assisting multiple guests. Almost a hour into our meal no refills and honestly it wasn't the servers fault he was slammed. I had to walk up to the front to get someone to help us.   At the end of our meal we where able to speak with a manager named Ron he was very apologetic about the experience we had and took care of us.",

I am giving two stars because things I enjoy about this establishment are: 1) They've never gotten my order wrong and 2) The food has always been up to par and consistent with other locations.   HOWEVER, I call to place an order to go on a weekday, and they immediately put me on hold to transfer my call. Like, why does my call need to be transferred? Aren't most calls for to go orders? Why is there no designated person to answer the phone, ready to take orders? On top of that, I'm on hold for 6 MINUTES before I hang up and try again. My call gets answered in just two rings, and I get placed on hold again...FOR FOUR MORE MINUTES. That's when my husband and I decided to get dinner elsewhere. Obviously they don't want our money, they don't value our business.   Other times I've gotten through and placed an order successfully over the phone, I show up the 15-20 quoted minutes later to have to wait around the bar (once a whole 20 more minutes--yeah, my fries were soggy).   My take-out experiences with this place are just so bad that I am not sure it will even be an option for us anymore. It's not worth the battle. It makes me mad to get bad service, and then I don't even get the food I want out of it, because I can't justify sticking around for bad service--and they don't care. I could yell or speak with the manager or whatever, but then I just become \"that\" customer. I'd rather just vent with this review and encourage the staff to STEP THEIR GAME UP.   Please. Because I really love a good whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap on a Wednesday night at home, and it burns my biscuits when I have to be on hold for 10 collective minutes, only to just give up and get Wendy's. :(",

At about 130pm a couple came and sat at the table next to us.  They ordered and in about 10 minutes received their food.  At around 2pm our waiter came over looking like he forgot about us and said he was going to go hurry the kitchen up.   He brought out cold pretzel bites for my wife and the cheese was gelatinous already.  We ordered fruit salad for my toddler, and this item never came out.  Even after I pointed out he did not get his fruit salad.    My sandwich and fries come out at about 220pm (over an hour after I ordered it).  It was as advertised and quite tasty. They forgot the sauce I asked for at first order and it was promptly brought out.    To recap.   -My food took 1 hour 20 mins to get there from the time we sat down. Was missing sauce I ordered.   -My son never received his fruit salad but was charged for it (I didn't complain because it was $1.49 and I didn't want to be stuck at the restaurant any longer).  We fed him some snacks from the diaper bag  -my wife just ordered pretzel bites because she wasn't very hungry.  They came out after about 45 mins of waiting and were obviously sitting for quite some time.    -I did not receive a drink refill or was I asked if I needed a refill (I was empty).

It's not because he has served us before, he can just tell by the age of the patrons, and his experience with the menu.  With all of the items on that menu, it amazed me.

My mother and I went on Sunday, after church. Our server was Bruce, who was very friendly, but extremely harried and forgetful; a lunch that should have taken less than an hour took us two whole hours!! That's Olive Garden slowness, not typical Red Robin speed. Our orders were simple: two burgers. Mine was fine, but mom ordered a chicken Whisky River BBQ and it was so salty that she had them remake it. That wasn't a huge issue, though.  If you ever eat here, only eat with Bruce if you're not in a hurry - he was slow when refilling our drinks, we had to ask for boxes three times because he kept walking away and doing other sidework for his empty tables. I overheard how he forgot things for one of his other tables next to us. And while he was pleasant, he would essentially come by, set your food down, and rush off to do whatever else he was thinking about.  Not a good Red Robin experience at all; probably my worst. Unfortunately will be back, because the mall location is even worse in service, but hopefully there are some other servers at this location who are better.",

    "text": "Have you ever been happy just to get the heck out of somewhere? I had that feeling tonight at Red Robin. My wife was craving a loaded cheeseburger so along with my 2 year old off we went. Being a Friday night the parking lot was almost full, my wife and I took the last two open spaces as she met us there. Once we stepped inside things went South. Rather than write war and peace let's just drop the facts:   1: They called that iced tea?  2: You quit carrying spinach and artichoke dip? WTF?  3: The Mushrooms / Zucchini appetizer picture had to be Photoshopped. What we got, well the mushrooms were edible. The zucchini was, well, ugh! 4: Normally the Fish and Chips are good. I've had them in Kansas City, Denver, and Vegas. Tonight's batch failed. Blah, boring, undercooked. Why mince words, it sucked.  5: I asked for malt vinegar sauce. 3 requests later someone finally gets it.  6: I would like my steak fries to be warm, preferably when they come to the table I want them hot enough when served that I don't want to keep my fingers on them for long. What I got made me wonder if the cook was celebrating 4/20 prior to coming to work.  7: 1.19 for two lame little bitty slices of avacado that looked like it was on it's last legs? Really? Pathetic.  8: My 2 year old thought the mac and cheese sucked. He ate two bites, thankfully the orange they served with it was good as that's all he ate. And it's hard to make kids food suck but they rose to the occasion.  9: On the way out we had to walk past a bunch of servers and a manager who wouldn't clear a path and they were talking about a large party that came in. The manager said and I quote \"I don't know where in the f*** to sit them, either they wait or they can sit on the damn floor\".   Needless to say I was happy to leave. Thankfully the Cupcakery that shares the same parking lot was still open to provide some sustenance that actually tasted good.    On my way home the way my stomach feels it made me wonder if I might need some Syrup of Ipecac before the night's over.   2 Stars: Our server was overworked but tried his best. And 1 star goes for the TV's that let me see the end of the Giants / Mets game.",

I sat at the bar which is within the smallest section of the restaurant and counted 4 tables that were empty but still had the dirty dishes on them. The entire bar was dirty as well, and even once I sat down, no effort was made to clean it.  This was all an hour and a half before closing.",

Half way through our dinner we were all out of drinks and we tried using their new \"Ziosk\" to order drinks, which personally I don't think is the way we should have to order our drinks, but the option wasn't even available so we sat waiting. While we were waiting for drinks the waiter told us his \"trainee\" would be getting our drinks. That is so unprofessional, calling her a partner or letting us know someone was helping him out wouldve been more respectful in my opinion. Overall it was just a poor example of the kind of service we are used to getting from this restaurant. I am very disappointed.",

    "text": "I usually go to Red Robins once a week. But this was my first time going to this location. I usually get a freckled lemonade and the whisky bbq burger, this place was no exception. I would rate the food five stars. The burger comes with bottomless steak fries and the drink is also bottomless... in other words UNLIMITED REFILLS. OMG haha. Usually when you order they immediately bring out the fries first, and by the time the burger comes out I am half way full. Which is quite pleasant because normally only fit half of the burger in my stomach and the next day I eat the other half of the burger. It's like your paying for two mealss for the price of one haha. Anyways this place would've been Five stars if it weren't for the lack of service. I'm not going to lie I drink a lot of water and lemonade even before the meal comes out, but out of the hour I was there I only got my cup refilled once. -_- and after that I waited a good 15-25 minutes for my bill. But overall if you just want some deeeelicious $10 and below hamburgers then this is the place to goo. Make sure you ask for a royalty card too!!! Free burgers on your bday and on your 10th one!",

I usually order a chicken sandwhich without the bun to keep it on the healthy side. But what I really want is the bottomless fries. So four or five months ago I go to this location and ordered my drinks. I then asked if I could get some fries to start as they are bottomless. I was told no they dont do that. I had been to that location many times. That was the FIRST time i was ever told no when asking that. Usually I also tip 20%...actually always. After leaving there, i felt ashamed because i didnt leave a 20% tip for the first time ever. Now today, after going to many other red robins and even that same one, I get the same waitress. My mind was made up; If she told me no fries to start I was leaving. Sure enough, nope can have fries. I immediately said ok we are leaving ( i was with two others). The manager rushed over to correct the situation. He told me that she meant to say that it will be a bit, not no we cant. So either one of them was lying. I dont deal with horrible customer service. I wont be going to this location anymore and the lady that was our server is and was awful.",

    "text": "First time for a bad review. And I want to say I do miss the Red Robin on Decatur.  I do not get to RR as much as I would have liked because they are all a distance from me anymore. So when I go to Doctor on that side of town I try to get there. Only once about 10 years ago I had a bad experience with them and up until yesterday they have always been the greatest in every way, Walked before 4pm, was mostly deserted. A first for anytime I have been to any RR. We were seated and then had to wait a bit before we were asked what we would like to drink, me? Iced tea, my guest coffee.My tea cam and it looked like a drop of color was added to water. NO TEA. So called server and he said he would get some from another station which was not really much better. Should have just had water. My guest was still waiting for his coffee. We had decided what we were going to have, mine always the Seafood Scatter. My guest chose a burger, Finally his coffee came. Long wait and we were finally served. My guest, his burger he said was good, We needed more napkins  and finally got a bus boy to get us some.My shrimp and clam strips were good but when I bit into the cod it was like a piece of gristle, The cod pieces were VERY small any way. I had fished a good part of my life off the CA coast for every cod imaginable and this was truly BLAH. Fries were not many and at no time were we asked if we wanted more fries. That has never happened before. Nor were we asked for or got a refill on coffee or tea. Almost 3$ for a drink of watered tea. By that time I was to tired and not happy and did not want to create a scene even tho there were not many to hear me if I did. The server put the bill on the table. I asked for a to go box and most of the time when the servers see there are NO MORE fries they will add a few. But not the time. There fries are excellent if you can get any.  Well I got the bill ready and waited and waited and again flagged a bus boy and asked for out server. He came and we paid the bill. Took the teeny pieces of cod with NO fires home. Normally I will snack on my doggie bag in the evening, Got the teeny piece and a half home and a couple hours later decided to have it. The cod was tough!!!!!!!!! First time in my life I have had tough cod and I am 78 years old and fished for years. Was barely a bite in the  piece to just tossed in garbage disposal.  Extremely disappointed and will not go back and I cannot count the times I have been to Red Robins and in the past so looked forward to the seafood platter, Should have turned into In'N\"Out just down the street. Never, ever been disappointed there.",

She was very personable while seating us.  The burgers were delicious, as usual.  On our way out, one of the managers was upfront calling the two hosts stupid, that's all I heard and that made me upset. The hostess name was Ashley, I will be coming back because of her and the awesome food.  The 5 stars goes to her.  I can tell she really cares about her job and her guests.   As for the manager, I'm not sure what his name is, but him calling the hosts stupid is unnecessary and unprofessional.  Actually I believe his name is Bryan, or Ryan.  Bryan or Ryan has ZERO stars, he should not be talking to his employees like that.   It is very disrespecting.

I asked a couple questions and she gave me the technical answer. Like... how big is this burger (I then motioned with my hands making a circle for size). She responds... it 4 ounces. I tried to get a size comparison with a visual size again and she says 2 -2 ounce pattys. So like I said professional but not friendly.  I would give 2.5 stars if it would let me but it didn't.",

Luckily, my husband reviewed the bill before simply paying it. We were charged for extra drinks and burgers we never ordered. The bill ended being half the amount after we questioned it. Our server was hard to track down when my food arrived with mistakes. I asked to add mayo to my burger and had to wait for my already cold food to be taken back and fixed. The food was good (after it was fixed), but the service was questionable. Maybe next time I'll just do take out instead.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came here on the 12th (which was a Sunday) at 12pm for lunch on his birthday. We were fully expecting some sort of an after-church lunch rush, but were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away by a hostess who was very cheerful and kind. This essentially NEVER happens to us because we come in with a double stroller containing an our 8 month old special needs foster son and our 14 month old daughter. And to top it off, we also have our 4 year old son. We tend to enter restaurants expecting to get a \"could you please wait one moment?\" while the hostess frantically searches for an empty area somewhere that she can stick our circus. Which, by the way, we honestly don't take offense to.... we totally get it. Lol.   Anyway. We were seated right away, and greeted right away by our waitress, Vanessa. Vanessa is AWESOME. She was prompt, polite, and didn't look at us sideways NOT EVEN ONCE for bringing 3 kids under 4 out for lunch. She had our drinks and appetizer out within minutes. And by minutes, I mean MAYBE 3-4 tops. We placed our order, and even our food arrived to our table within 15 minutes. All of our food was steaming hot and SO good. I stick to a mostly vegan diet, so Red Robin is somewhat of a \"rare unicorn\" thing for me. I went all in (since it was the fiance's birthday and all) and had the new salmon sandwich. HOLY SHIT. Order this damn thing! AT ONCE! I can't even explain, it was just perfection with each bite. My fiance always gets the burnin' love burger made with chicken and swears by it.   Suffice to say, the service, the Vanessa, and the salmon were ah-mazing. Hands down the best Red Robin experience I've ever had.",

The hostess was very nice and we're seated immediately. Started out with Chi Chili Cheese Fries, this was very good.  We ordered Cluck & Fries, and a Smoke & Pepper burger. They were both delicious and came with bottomless fries. If we had known, we would have pass on the appetizer.  The waitress was very attentive came to check on us at least every 5 minutes. The place is clean and nice atmosphere. Overall, we glad to have a chance to come in here again. Definitely would visit again when in the neighborhood.",

The restaurant wasn't full, but the lobby area was. I'm not sure what the reason was, but we didn't have to wait any more than 5 minutes and the host was pleasant.  When we were walking to our booth all I noticed was how filthy the floor was. Straw wrappers, French fries, napkins. It wasn't a few spots, it was the whole place. It was a huge turn off.  We ordered 2 iced teas, an order of the pretzel bites, and split a Black Pepper Burger ($32 with the tip). Even though it seemed like a long time to get our food, I may have just been impatient. Everything was good, but the burger was like warm at best.  Our service was excellent, though, so I might give them another chance.",

    "text": "This is in no way a Handicapped friendly restaurant. It would be impossible for a wheelchair unless previous arrangements for a very front table is made.   I use a walker, so I was dropped off near door, as there were no handicapped spots available, which is no problem, it is expected many times. When I went in to give hostess name & count in party, we had this strange back & forth discussion. I kept saying 4 plus a high chair, and she would respond with, \"So 5\" and I'd say, no, 4 plus a highchair. So then she would say 4 total & I'd say, plus a highchair. We settled on 5.  When hostess called us, we were walked to the very far back of restaurant & then the hostess expected us to go left to as far back on the other side of restaurant. My daughter immediately told hostess, I would not be able to get thru the next to nothing aisle. So we were turned around to go back the way we had come but a shorter distance to the original table the hostess had planned for us.   By the time we reached it, I was in severe pain & needed to sit. Amazingly, there were two tables put together just like ours, with a better set up for highchair & my walker to be folded & placed, however, we passed it for the next set up. This set up was awful, especially when it was time to leave because of course, by then other people were sitting at the tables that would have been far better for us. Thus, they had to stand up so I could get out from behind our table.  A suggestion I would give, is for hostess to put the letter H next to the name, trained for it's meaning, as it became obvious none of the 3 hostesses who had watched my coming in with kind guests opening double set of doors, so after training what a walker means & requires, they can then plan accordingly for proper tables.   However, I doubt anything for the handicapped would be taken into consideration at this popular, so called family restaurant or I guess a handicapped 63 yr old grandmother is not considered family. The tables & chairs are so crammed in to get the higher profit, at the sake of any elderly people struggling to walk in between what looks like a horrible mess.  Before starting a career, I started as a busgirl at Caesar's, I had been a waitress at a Denny's, and the original MGM. My career was a Corporate Meeting & Special Event Coordinator. I found Red Robin a nightmare!",

    "text": "I am super annoyed tonight. I am updating my review of this location to 1 star.   Let me say, my kids and I used to come to this location literally about one a week, several years ago. It has drastically gone downhill over time.   My little one for some reason remembered that this location has a chalk board in the lobby when we were walking through the parking lot. Got inside, only to realize they are out of chalk. First disappointment.   We were seated, and the hostess didn't give my little one any crayons or paper like they normally do. We asked the server, and we were told they are also out of crayons, but that the manager was trying to find some in the back. Second disappointment.   I ordered the freckled lemonade, which was very watered down, and only had 2 pieces of strawberry in it. Third disappointment.   I ordered the Royal burger, no bacon, with a veggie patty. The burger came out with 2 giant pieces of bacon it. Normally I would ask the kitchen to remake the burger, but based on my last experience last week at this same location, I didn't bother.   Side note, last week I ordered the croissant blta, no bacon. Of course, the sandwich came out with bacon on it. I asked them to remake the sandwich, and it was brought out just a few moments later. I took off the top piece of croissant to see, and sure enough, there were 2 holes where the wooden sticks had been put through the sandwhich. They didn't remake anything, just removed the bacon. I could have done that myself I guess. Good thing I'm not allergic!   Back to this visit. Ate my food, and drank my water I had ordered in place of the lemonade. Decided to order dessert to go. I ordered the freckled lemonade cake. I have had this dessert about 4 times now.   Well, I just opened my cake and there is no strawberry sauce or strawberries! Seriously?!? Isn't that the point?  I told the manager about most of this when she stopped by our table. She didn't have much to say other than \"I'm sorry\" and \"we will try to do better.\" Then she took our $4 onion rings off of the bill.  Ugh.   I am really disappointed. We used to come all the time, and have been customers since this location opened in 2005. We most likely won't be going back for a while. The service has slowly been declining. They won't even take your payment if you are using a debit card. You have to do it yourself on the little kiosk things. Super annoying.",

Specifically designed to partition families into a separate area of the restaurant, making it noisier louder and in general much poorer experience. Servers are more stressed, service is slower, equipment that has been pointed out before on previous visits has never been fixed (such as broken lights).  Find it a bit disrespectful to be segregated to a run-down corner of the restaurant just because we have children. We pay the same prices as everyone else, so I would expect the same courtesy and service. This establishment is not recommended if you have families. Other Red Robin locations in Las Vegas area are better suited, like the location at the Galleria mall.",

The Blue Ribbon burger ( not sure that the name is correct) had just a few crumbs of blue cheese and the serving portion of blue cheese dressing was less than half full , about the amount that would fit in a thimble. While the burger it's self was very good, the price of $15.99 is was not. Just had water and with the tip & tax $21.61 for just one person. Without a doubt my last visit.",

We did end up speaking with the manager and she did explain to me that their head cook was a no call, no show.  Not really my problem, but she was really sweet about it and did apologize.  It would have been nice to hear from the hostess that the wait for the food would be longer than usual due to this situation.  This way, you know what to expect and are not sitting there chewing on your clothes because you are so hungry and see all of this food around you.  Our waiter was non existent, we had empty water glasses(a big no no in my book),probably because he saw us talking with the manager.  I will chalk up our experience as an off night.  I will probably give them one more shot and see if things have changed.",

I ordered the onion rings, a french onion soup, and one of the new burgers (it had some kind of hawaiian slaw on it).  Onion rings were good, but the french onion soup never came...   Burger had a good flavor to the slaw however the MEAT had no flavor at all! Not sure how they managed to do this but they did... no seasoning, no taste, nothing... It didn't even taste grilled..  other then that everything else was fine, drinks are great and the service was top notch. i'll be returning to try to get an update in for this Red Robin.",

She promptly brought back our kids' drinks and forgot our waters and drinks. It took ten minutes to get two waters and a beer. Five minutes after that she took our order.   FOURTY-FIVE minutes later we got our food. We have already been here for an hour. Why on earth could it possibly take this long for 4 burgers and fries? None of our drinks were refilled. Ever. The manager brought us our food and my husband asked him to bring a new drink and refill our sons drink, I also asked him for the two sides of honey mustard we were missing. He proceeded to tell me we were asking for to much. Sorry sir, but if my waitress ever came by I'd ask her instead. Waited Almost ten minutes for honey mustard, which was brought by two members of the kitchen staff... Not sure what that was all about.  My burger was sooooo greasy that within two minutes the bun was a soggy disaster. The burger was falling apart faster than I could eat it, and the bun had turned completely to mush.  Fries and especially their honey mustard, great as always. So I guess the two stars are for the honey mustard if I'm being honest. We sat there as our two year olds who had finally had enough started getting antsy and knocking everything to the floor. It was probably 15 minutes before we were actually done eating before we saw our server again, in which she dropped off the check and walked off. Had to hunt her down to actually get her to run the card so we could leave. Awful awful customer service. And they either need to get more hardcore buns or cut WAY back on the grease so avoid the soggy disaster that is served to you.  My advice red robin? Fire everyone at this location and start over. Your staff is destroying this restaurant.",

As with BJs right down the street, you can seat yourself at the high top tables in the bar or directly at the bar. Service is quick. Doesn't make the food any better, but it makes the experience tolerable.  Anyway, the food: I just discovered my adoration of any burger with a fried egg on it. RR has one and it's tasty. The rest of the food is fast-food quality. Even the burned fries are soggy.   RR is good for a quick bite when you don't really care too much about what you're eating.

The restaurant was half full at 8 PM on a weekday, and they claimed they ran out of glassware, hmmmmm. The endless fries got one refill for two of us, and then the wait staff just disappeared.   When we finally cornered our waitress and asked for another refill, she said she would take care of it, and after a long 15 minutes we got our last refills.  If they advertise something, they should serve it. As a former pro football player, I do have an appetite, but to have deceptive service of avoiding refills we will NEVER go to Red Robin again.

I couldn't eat my salad, the dressing was like a thin mayonaise mixture; a sour, thin, non-fat dressing texture.  My daughters Southwestern salad had a simular thin dressing mixture.    The restaurant was not that busy, it was a Saturday afternoon, we were seated in the bar.  Our server was also the bartender.  He could care less about checking on us.  My regular  margarita, on the rocks, tasted like soap and had a milky color to it.    We were very disappointed, usually Red Robin is pretty good.",

My only wish was there were more steak fries with my meal. I figured since in store they are refillable, why not give a little extra in takeout too? All in all, go get you some Red Robin. Great burger joint in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "Come here for lunch often with coworkers and decided to bring mom this past Friday. This is burger heaven, and I love the fact that you can substitute the typical red meat patty for a Boca or Gardenburger patty if you're vegetarian like I am.  This past visit was pretty decent. The server we had was very attentive and friendly and the food was right on par. Only downside is that our server forgot to ask if we would like fries while we waited on our lunch. I didn't bother to ask because they typically ask or just automatically bring them to you. So we waited for ten minutes until our lunch arrived and once it did, they brought my mom fruit instead of fries as her side. So then I asked for a basket of fries.  Mom ordered the Simple Burger and it didn't come with cheese. Neither of us noticed that it didn't from the menu, so we had to ask for a slice of cheese on the side.   At the end of the day, the food was great and the fries are always great. Only downfall is that we were both starving and didn't get the bottomless fries treatment. All in all, I'll be back in some fashion, whether it be with coworkers, mom or friends.   PS You guys need to get on the Coke Zero bandwagon!!",

    "text": "Let's sing it all together... Red... Robin...... BUMmmmmm.  After a long day of sporting events, we wanted to grab something good and quick.  Second time we have been here since the remodel, and AGAIN the menu has changed. The biggest change was the raise in prices. A $10 to $15 Hamburger is not a family friendly price. But I will admit my burger was tasty, but to call them gourmet because they have different con sauces and toppings is an understatement to charge so much.  Instead of fries I chose to substitute with a cup of French Onion soup which cost extra, that's fine, Surprise, they have new dishes, that include a small square shaped bowl that probably holds 3 ounces, but by the time they put in the bread, I may have had 2 Tsp. of broth,  My one daughter ordered a burger which she ate 1/2, saying it didn't have much flavor. The other daughter a pizza and my husband a soup and salad. No complaints.  Our server was very busy with large groups of tables but was still very attentive to us.  Here's the topper, they have an electronic pad on all the tables. It advertises specials, let's you pay your bill, or you can play games. My one daughter looked at it briefly to see what all the pad did. When we got the bill, there was a charge for an entertainment fee. When I questioned it our server said it was from playing the games. I thought for a moment because no one played a game. But my daughter did hit the click on the button here for games when she was looking at it. When I looked at the pad, I waited for the game screen to pop up, when it did in white lettering along a blue sky with white clouds reads that you will be charged. Our waiter was kind and removed the charge, which we appreciated.",

We came in and instantly got greeted by our seater, I forgot what our servers name was but she was the best! Usually when I go to a Red Robin in a different location it takes forever for them to bring me what I need whether it be napkins, campfire or ranch sauce, or a refill on my bottomless lemonade! But I can't stress enough about how my server was on top of everything! I didn't need to ask for anything at all. She brought like 5 napkins right off the bat, the shortie rings with ranch and campfire sauce and then another ranch and campfire sauce when our burgers came. The thing I noticed the most though was when I ordered the strawberry lemonade it came in a curvy glass and when she brought me a refill without me asking it was in a huge glass! That's never happened before because at other locations I would just get a refill on the curvy glass but I wasn't complaining! ^-^ the manager even stopped by to ask us how we were doing and if she could get us anything and got us our 3rd refill! So basically, we will not only be coming here because it's the nearest one to us, but for the great service and all the kind employees!   + I recommend anyone who loves red robin as much as I do to get a red robin royalty card!  Get 9 entrees for 10th free.  Free birthday burger  And lots of other rewards!",

Hell, blindfold me and take me to each Red Robin without me knowing and I still won't know the difference. It's just like movie theaters, they have all the same movies and expensive prices for snacks. The difference that separates each chain restaurant is the service and etc.  This Red Robin's service is inconsistent. Though our servers are always nice, I remember one in particular who just showed no personality or emotions. I felt like I was talking to a wall. She made me feel that I shouldn't even be there and that she shouldn't be there. Otherwise, most servers are courteous. The only issue I have is their inconsistency. They're not as timely as other Red Robins but I would actually blame the fact that there aren't enough waitresses. When I was there, I would only see 3 maybe 4 at most servers working. For a restaurant that has near 100 person capacity, that is slavery.",

I'm not sure if all Red Robins are like this location, but it's nice that there's a full bar area to separate you from the regular crowd of families with lots of kids.  The drink menu has a lot of awesome little drinks like the Skinny Sweet Tea, and the Skinny Vodka Lemonade.  They were delicious.    I usually get the bacon cheeseburger and substitute chipotle mayo instead of regular mayo.  Then I get onion rings instead of fries, with a side of onion ring sauce.  The burgers are always cooked perfectly and served hot.  I love the breading on the onion rings - very crispy and crunchy.  The onion ring sauce goes with ANYTHING.  My friends were dipping their burgers in the sauce, lol.   Our service this past weekend was great!  Our server checked on us often and brought us everything we needed quickly.  She was great!",

Come in, and hosts says it's a 10 minute wait, while I look at 40 empty tables. 20 minutes later we get seated in a very dark part of the dining room. I noticed that about half of every light bulb in the place is burnt out. Tried to play squares with my daughter but the only crayon colors are green and yellow, so when it's dim inside you can't see yellow on the paper. Our table is super wobbly and very sticky. My chair is set in a walking path for servers. My daughter asked for oranges, but they are out. The lemonade was straight water. Wife's burger didn't come with onions like she asked for. There is a persistent smell of sewage gas out front which is really unappetizing to smell before you come in. The table by us just got food dumped all over them with multiple side sauces... this place never seems to improve...  Previous Review:   Another bad service experience at Red Robin. Host sits us at a table and probably waited 15 minutes before the host noticed us sitting here with no drinks. Then she went and got our server, and he blamed it on a miscommunication between the host and server, BUT common intuition would tell you that a family of 5 sitting between two of your active tables might mean that you are assigned to serve us. Still sitting here waiting for my kids beverages to show up, if they show up at all. This place is soooooo bad consistently. I think they strive to piss everyone off that comes through the door.   Went in again today, 1/14, and ordered food for the kids at first. It came out without a hitch, but when my wife 's and my burgers didn't come out after 20 minutes I mentioned it to the server. She went over to the line to find it. 5 minutes later she returned with the cold burgers. Also",

    "text": "We have eaten here several times over the years and have always had a great dining experience. This particular occasion, we dined in for lunch. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. The only thing to frown upon during this visit was the taste of the sweet tea..regular tea was made to be \"sweet\" by the addition of something in the restaurant. Same thing with the raspberry tea..they add raspberry flavor to regular tea. Once drinks were brought to the table, our order was taken. We were pleasantly surprised when our food was delivered what seemed like moments after ordering. All food ordered was delicious! Our waitress and manager checked on us several times, which was appreciated. We love that you can also pay your bill at the table and split the checks if needed. Thanks Red Robin for the great service as always!",

Our waiter didn't provide the friendly customer service that you expect, he was more about keeping his eyes on the television screen as he took our order,  so he was not all there, he asked if there is anything else you need after we finished our food as he walked away to the new guests at the table next to us, he acted like he didn't hear our request for the bottomless fries.  I dont know if that's how they're trained or not but I won't be going there any time soon.  I'd much rather give my hard earned money to a restaurant that appreciates its guests and is willing to keep a pleasant atmosphere for all, and that they hire quality people who are able to provide the utmost customer respect and service.  I don't recommend this restaurant.",

Also their onion rings are really good, not sure what other sauce that comes with it but it does come with ranch and something else.

I gave it another chance, at my kids' request. It has improved significantly. I ordered the NachOMGs. The chips were nice and crispy; everything was fresh, except the chili because, of course, it was cooked. There were only a few pieces of meat, but they were on the large size--I cut each one in half. The chili itself was not memorable, but the nachos overall were great! My son said his mandarin oranges had seeds in them, but the chicken he ate was very good. My daughter ate up her mandarin oranges and is still working on her mini corn dogs, so I would say, she's enjoying her food. The server was very friendly and kindly answered the kids' questions. Service is everything in my book. We'll definitely be back!",

For a 'Bottomless' feature, why would a server wait until the customers' plates are empty, pushed away, with napkins and table service piled on top?    No smile, no asking on refills - zip - zero.

The last time I went to this location was the first time we have been there since they added all the new menu items.  My wife ordered a chicken dish and I ordered a burger.  These items obviously have much different cook times.  After a while the waitress came and said the food will be out soon and that they were waiting on the chicken.   When the food came my wife's chicken entree was nice and hot but my burger and fries were cold and stale.  There was not even a hint of warmth and it was clear they made my burger right away and had it sitting there while making my wife's chicken.  The waitress agreed it was unacceptabley cold and took it back to be re-made.  After leaving within 30 minutes I had a serious case of the squirts.  My stomach was so upset we had the end our day of errands and go home.  I am convinced that the kitchen tampered with my food because I sent it back.  Red Robin has become such a joke.  They have tried to re brand themselves as \"burgers and brews\" but their beer selection is pathetic and it still has the family vibe.  They tried adding a more extensive menu that they can't handle.  This leaves a confusing place that doesn't seem to be a good fit for anybody.  They should have just stuck with being the spot you take your family for a good gourmet burger.",

Basically made it seem like my grandma was crazy because she knew it tasted weird but because everyone stuck their hands in the burger and didn't see no other sauce it was our fault. She offered to make her a new burger but after this kind of experience we chose to pass on it. The service here is terrible. Don't blame the customer for not liking your burgers.

I LOVE their fries with a passion and every few months will crave them, I rarely do burgers so when I do them - they better be good.  I generally order the Royal Red Robin Burger because the egg can be so tasty!  This last time, the burger started out delicious, but once it started to cool down - the American Cheese congealed into something not so tasty and attractive looking and made the burger inedible half way through. I think I will order something different next time without American Cheese.  My boyfriends burger was good all the way through though.   Our food came SUPER fast and our waitress was very nice and attentive.  The location isn't near us, but we make a trip down there every so often so I can get a Very Berry Limeade and Fries!",

We had to ask twice for her to fill our drinks as she walked by our table three times! Our order then came out, wrong. Of course. But she was at our neighboring table twice as often. She did not stop to ask us how things were, just said \"are you ok?\" And kept walking. Hello? Is there a problem? It's not busy. Does she think the larger table behind us tips more? Sorry darlin' you're mistaken. So during calling her to get our check fixed, as the add-on items we ordered were not sent, we waited another 10 minutes after pressing the call server button. Seriously? So then, after saying \"oh, sorry\" she did not offer to even take the item off the bill or put in an order...I had to actually ask her to remove the charge from the check. Needless to say I will never be back, and this waitress needs to look for another field to work in. This is why servers don't make more than $2-3/hour. You earn your keep in this field.

But I'm a paying customer and it's unacceptable to treat anyone different than you would a more \"distinguished\" looking customer. She gave us the wrong drinks which we were charged for and slammed them on the table and asked \"y'all ready or not\". The food runner came and was very nice but we were not checked on for at least 15 minutes. As a waiter myself, I would get an ass chewing for doing so. Meanwhile she continued to serve everyone around us, while having a smile on her face. Everyone except for us. After another 15 minutes of waiting she came over to see if we were ready to pay. I informed her of the charged drinks, she fixed it, then slammed the computer thing in front of me. At this point I'm pretty pissed off. I honestly contemplated leaving the restaurant without paying. Sadly I don't remember her name because I would've put her on blast on here. I find it shitty because I frequent this restaurant and always get really great service. Just not this time. I'll most likely come back again because my little brothers like the food. But on God if I get her as my waitress again, I'm dipping out of there and going across the street to eat island sushi. * drops mic",

It was over 70 degrees here for the first time this year!  Hooray!    Our first impression was not stellar.  It took a long time to clear off an outdoor table.  They were empty, but full of old food and dishes.  When we did order it took a long, long time for it to come out (which is why they push their appetizers).  I was nostalgic for Kirk's (see Cupertino and Palo Alto) Pineapple Cheese burger, so I ordered the Banzai burger.  It was very good, but the teriyaki sauce was a little sweet.  Their fries are totally forgettable. My husband ordered the fish and chips.  OUTSTANDING.  Crunchy, hot, moist inside.  I could have eaten them all.  They even had malt vinegar.

    "text": "I had lunch here last week with 3 coworkers. If I had dined alone, I would be giving Red Robin 4, perhaps even 5 stars, as my experience was great. Sadly two of the three people I was with had issues with their food though, so I am giving this Red Robin experience a 3.  We started out lunch with a basket of fries. Red Robin has delicious steak cut fries which they will give you unlimited refills on. It's pretty much impossible to leave Red Robin hungry because you can always fill up on the tasty fries.   I had the soup and sandwich combo which was a BLTA sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder. One of my coworkers ordered a turkey burger. Another ordered the crispy chicken tender salad, and the third ordered red's rice bowl.   My order came out fine, as did the crispy chicken tender salad. (The salad looked amazing, I will probably order it the next time I go) The turkey burger came out as directed but it was under cooked. The person that ordered the rice bowl ended up with a chicken salad.   Our server did a good job of rectifying our issues, but I still have to base my review on everything that happened. I have had many good experiences with other Red Robin locations over the years, because of that and the fact that our server fixed our problems I will certainly go back and give this location another try in the future.",

Our waitress was also extremely nice and very good with service. Overall a great place to eat.",

We DID eat at the one on Sunset four years ago, and it was tasty, but if they're both overseen by the same district manager doubtless that one has gone downhill too.",

On the menu, the veggie burger was specified as Morningstar Griller's Prime, and I even asked the waiter to be sure. When the burger arrived, it was a Gardenburger. I asked the waiter to take it back, and he gets someone else (I assume the manager), to come over and tell me that they have switched veggie burgers since the menu was printed. My daughter didn't want to take a chance on ordering anything else, so she just ate her fries.",

They are known for their burgers, which go for about $10, that is just a big hunk of  meat with all the regulars, but also some that are \"different and unique.\" Keep in mind, I am a lover for the burgers.   The last time I went we were told by our waitress that our Strawberry Lemonade (yes, I'll admit, this IS amazing) and our fries, were not as bottomless as we thought??? They advertise bottomless drinks and fries with their meals, but .... \"they aren't as bottomless as you think.\" Okay... I understand you cant have a party of 12 in there for 2 hours endlessly gorging on fries and drinks, but come on, there were 4 of us. And your measly helping of 8 fries per basket disappears fast, but.... oh well.  So, if you want some bar food, go to a bar. It will be cheaper and more generously portioned whether bottomless or not.",

Usually they have bigger and reasonable portions for the common person. I never questioned paying 10$ for a wrap because I knew it was of fair size. Tonight I discovered the drastic change in portion as well as the increase in price. Red Robin is NOT gormet.  It is a American burger place known for fries, shakes, and burgers. They should not charge higher pricing and give their customers bearly half of what used to be given. You can say I'm outraged but paying 13$ for a lack-luster plate of food and a bill for three being 60$ is a little outrageous for burgers. The food is GOOD. Always has been. The pricing and smaller portions are nothing to be desired.",

I immediately ordered a bloody mary. It was mediocre. Nothing to brag about.  I couldn't decide what to order. I opted for a chicken sammich. The California Chicken or something? Add jalapenos.  Friend ordered some type of bbq burger.  Mine came out and had huge slices of raw jalapenos on it. I don't even mind the fact that the jalapenos were raw, bring the heat! But they were sliced SO thick it just makes them NOT good. The chicken was nearly inedible as well. It tasted super fake and just gross.  Friend initially said the burger was good, but half way thru came to realize that it actually WASN'T.  Needless to say I was not at all satisfied with our food choices that morning and will not be returning.",

After some confusion by the woman at the front, we were quickly seated. I really appreciated that they removed a chair so my grandma's wheelchair could fit in place of the chair. It's the little things.  Since we are regulars, we ordered as soon as our waiter came over. Our waiter was Marquese (I hope I spelled that right!) and he was super awesome, funny, and just a great guy. I asked him about the dairy free options since their online allergen menu was finicky, and he was able to answer all my questions. He took our orders back, and was quick to let us know that the kitchen was out of one of the items we ordered, but we picked something else. And, when we finished eating, they brought my dad an ice cream and sang to him! It seems silly, but I really wanted to make sure they acknowledged his birthday for him. Like I said, it's the little things.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I absolutely hate the stupid tablets on the table.  For some reason, we had 3 on our table when we sat down, and we moved the other two away without realized that they were all registered to different tables. So when it came time to pay the bill, we sat around waiting because our little tablet never lit up, because it was on someone else's table. I wish the waiters would either teach us how to use it, or just do it for us. I haven't been back here since before they started using the tablets, so I was lost when it came time to order and pay. I also dislike that their online allergen menu is wonky. I know this isn't a problem specific to this Red Robin, and luckily our waiter was knowledgeable about allergens, but I would hate to go back and get a waiter that didn't know. I just hope this review gets passed on to the people that can change this information.  Overall, this is a great location to visit and I will definitely be back. Hopefully I learn how to use the tablet by then!",

We talked to the manager who was, of course, very apologetic and told us not to worry about the check because \"he'd take care of it\". We debated leaving at this point, but decided to stay. The meal itself was ok, but I asked for some things on my burger that never arrived. Even after I asked for them a second time.   When it came time for the check the manager did NOT \"take care of it\". We got a bill for the full amount. Even if he wasn't going to comp the meal I at least expected he'd comp the soda. We left there angry and do not plan to return. Oh, and they didn't do anything for my birthday either.",

The place was very busy but we were seated immediately. We were seated near a window and right away I noticed dried food on the window sill. Not a good sign.  I ordered the fish and chips which, even though I wasn't hungry, I enjoyed and finished all of them.  I also had to try a tasted on my girlfriends burger. That was okay I've had better.  Over all the food and service were decent. I'd eat here again.....but clean your window sills.",

I ordered the cape cod sandwich,  which was okay definitely better then ordering it at a fast food spot. The only thing that i was displeased with was my son's food. I ordered him a pizza with fries. When the server brought out the pizza the crust was burnt and the fries were placed on top, which is a no no for picky eaters. So i wasnt surprised he didnt eat it.",

The food came out around the same time and I thought it was pretty good considering we are a party of about 15. The service was cordial but disorganized. Our party of 15 were crammed at a table meant for a smaller party and they told us that once the table next to us clears up, that the table would be combined. Unfortunately, they forgot about it and had another party sit there instead when there are other empty tables. Needless to say, our meal somewhat felt like eating in a crammed bus. Very up close and personal.   I think the drinks/shakes here are pretty good. I ordered the Hawaiian Hearttrob and enjoyed it. The fries are also decent. But I was really unimpressed by the rest. I ordered the Prime Rib Dip, which was on the dry side. The meat was dry and flavorless. The au jus lacked flavor. The salad and coleslaw were both not fresh. Our server was also disorganized to the end by mixing up our bills.   Would I come back again? Probably not unless I have to.",

    "text": "First and foremost I'm a huge fan of the brand. I've been a customer of RR for over 10 years. So much a fan that my family and friends typically get me a gift card for RR for the holidays or birthday.  Sadly this has to be the worst RR I've been too.   Started out as soon as we walked in. They seemed extremely under staffed for lung time. We came in around 130 last Thursday. We were seated at one of the only clean table in the dining area. We counted 9 tables that hadn't been fully bused. Drink glasses everywhere. Ok, I get, slammed and short staffed. I work in the restaurant industry so I get it.  We went ahead and ordered and I as always got the bottomless rootbeer floats. It's a bargain for 4.99. Tree the Blue Ribbon burger also with my bottomless fries crispy. That was the first time we saw our server. Didn't catch her name. Tattooed brunette. Well I was thirsty so the float lasted 2 minutes. Put my glass politely at the edge of the table to signal her.  A runner or another server brought out our food. Our server didn't come back to see if we needed anything. We sat there for about 10 minutes waiting on someone to ask if we needed anything because we did. We needed a side of their chipotle mayo and a side of blue cheese dressing and I was in desperate need of something to drink, a refill on my route beer float.  Our way to finally saw that we needed something as I politely called out to her across the dining room. I guess there were a couple of regulars and she was busy attending to them. Mind you no one has attended to the nine tables with dishes and drinks on them. She came up give us a look and we asked for the refill on the route beer float and the sides of dressing at which point she made no apology and just informed us there be a surcharge for the chipotle mayo. She brought the float back first. By the time she went to the kitchen and came back with the dressings I had already finished the second float and aspirate third. Both empty glasses remained at the table while she rushed to the bar and brought me a third glass.  But now I had already finished my third float and my crispy fries were soggy from sitting around. I went ahead and ate them because I was starving. Another 15 or 20 minutes past and my fries were empty and I still had half of my burger left and yet another empty float. She came back after I had to call out to her once again. Asked for one more float and another order fries. The float came and added to the three empty glasses that I had. After she cleared the table the fries finally came out along with her pointing out that we can pay online.  Not sure what the issue was, maybe they were just all having a bad day. But it's definitely not the Service and attitude I'm used to when I go to RR. Definitely won't be back to this place.",

I love how this place offers so many different varieties of burgers- they don't ONLY serve burgers but salads, sandwiches and so much more!  I got a Banzai burger which had a slice of pineapple and teriyaki sauce, and hubs got a Madlove burger. His burger was seriously delish- just like the name, \"Madlove\" it really was. It's got cheddar and Parmesan crisp on top of provolone and Swiss, then they add jalapeno, bacon, avocado, tomato red onions and lettuce. How can this burger go wrong with all the heavenly ingredients on it?! It was so so good and cooked perfect medium. I've been a huge fan of their banzai burger hut after this visit, I think it's fair to say this Madlove burger has taken over the most favorite spot!   Kids menu options are great, reasonably priced as well.  Overall, We had a very pleasant visit :)",

    "text": "I took my family out for dinner and had a disappointing experience.  Arrived around 7:30 and the server (Jenn) already seemed to be agitated. The fries arrived shortly after the drinks were served. They were cold and definitely old. Next up, we noticed our ketchup was low so I got up to find another ketchup, ended up looking at around 15 different tables just to find dark red, spoiled ketchup ( I would know considering I'm in the restaurant industry) Overall, the taste of the food was sub par, definitely not what we typically experience when we come to your restaurant. Towards the end of the meal, as she was cleaning up, she reached over me and grabbed my beverage that I was still drinking. When I mentioned to her that I was still drinking, she made an inappropriate comment, \"I'm just trying to get out of here *haha*\" As we were checking out, I noticed we had a reward for a free burger but she insisted that all I had was a free shake. I told her that I wanted to use the free burger but she continued to say, \"No, there's only a free shake available\" then proceeded to bring out the shake. So one last time I pointed out to her, yet again, I had a free burger and only at that time did she acknowledge I was correct. She swiftly took the shake off the table and threw it away. Also, for the record, instead of taking off my specialty-burger or my wife's specialty-burger she took the least expensive burger off out of the 5 of us that dined.  Once again, quite disappointing, hopefully this doesn't fall on deaf ears.          Respectfully submitted, the 5 that dined.  It's now been 2 weeks and no one from the Las Vegas Eastern Ave. location has reached out nor has corporate. It's definitely a shame given the poor experience and over abundance of restaurants here in Vegas.",

You get unlimited refills on your fries or salad and we were able to actually get our waitresses attention and order a second helping (not that it was needed).  I had the big Sir Acha Tavern with a salad and the wife had the Whiskey River BBQ with fries.  Okay, they do not explain the Big burger to you so I asked. It is $2.5 more so you expect a bigger burger.... well hold on. It is the same 1/3 oz patties, but they are made into one burger. So same start weight, theoretically you end up with more meat in the end because the thicker burger will not cook down as far as two individual burgers. Did I notice a huge difference? No. I did notice that there was more moisture left in the big patty than when you get the smaller ones.  The fries were rather good tonight, crispy outside and soft inside and the salad was actually refreshing.  I had the Ghost pepper burger on my last visit, the Sir Acha seemed spicier to me.  Dining room was clean and quite quiet. Waitress was attentive and our water glasses never went empty.",

They are most known for their burgers, but have many other offerings as well.  I joined their loyalty program awhile ago because they give you a free burger on your birthday every year. This program is pretty great - I am regularly receiving discounts, BOGO burgers and other offers. They keep track of your purchases and every 10th burger is free. I love the freckled lemonade, they have awesome shakes and you can also get bottomless root beer floats for only $4.99. Add that to their bottomless steak fries and you've got a winning combination!  The service can be hit or miss, but it hasn't really been a big deal. We always enjoy our visits there and it tends to be the place we go when we can't really decide on anywhere specific.",

Not only were we surrounded by dirty, uncleared tables for the majority of our dinner, but our server was absent for most of the time as well!  Our waters were served in plastic cups and we were told they ran out of glassware.  No biggie, except as the night went on, guests who arrived after us were receiving their drinks in glassware.  I also ordered a regular chocolate shake and that was sitting at the bar (in a small plastic cup) for about 10 -15 minutes!!    Our food came out and I had to ask for my shake.  When asked if this was a regular sized shake, our server said yes.  We've ordered regular sized shakes here many times and we have never received it in a plastic cup nor in a size that small!  Food was good, but fries were not given in a large quantity.  We actually had to ask for more fries before we were even halfway done with our burgers, just to wait 15 minutes for them! For a burger joint fries shouldn't take that long to get refilled especially if you're known for bottomless fries.  We were just about done with our meal when they finally started cleaning the tables around us.  I had to ask someone for our check because once again, our server was nowhere to be found.

She said that she couldn't find my name on list.  Then the girl that took my name find my name and said someone must have said we were a walk out. Huh?  She never admitted that she did it, but you could tell that she was caught in a lie. Other lady seated us and said a manager would talk to us.  Guess what no manager stopped by and during the meal the hostess that made us wait 45 mins walked by us to talk to a bus boy and didn't even apologize. She's obviously doesn't care about customers and I guess the same could be said about management there.  Worst part is that my daughter really wanted to eat here because it was our date night, her choice.  I doubt that anyone will follow up...so be warned that operations related to customer service is terrible, food good. Be ready to wait like we did!",

During that time a female waiter came by and asked, \"have you been waiting awhile\", and we said we have been recently seated, \"but....\" And then she walked away. After staring down the manager she apologized and took our order. She was very pleasant and stated she would be our waiter. Later a different waitress brought our beverages. I'm concerned because Red Robin does not have a difficult service model - basically it can't get much more simple from a service concept. There were many waiters on the floor and none of them looked very confident. We ordered the boneless chicken wings before our burgers. These are laughingly the worst chicken nuggets I have ever had. Overly breaded, hard, over cooked, incredibly small Pieces of chicken resembling nothing close to any kind wing or anything worth 9.00. Wow, I can't even believe this item is on the menu. The manager did cut our bill (second star) thank you, but we won't be back for a very very long time.",

She said it is only showing 20% off on my account. She had such an attitude. I'm so disappointed with the service and won't be going back anytime soon.

Sat in the bar at a high top table there were about 4 other tables sat in bar area with one bartender which is not busy at all. Our bartender took 20 mins to take our entree order after we received apps. Which usually they would have been back shortly after putting an appetizer order in. Finally got our entree order in...20 mins after that I got up and walked to kitchen and asked for them to bag up our food as we had plans to meet friends for New year's Eve..the girl nicely said no problem and she would being it to our table sat for at least another 7-10 mins a female manager came over with our order and said here you I explained to her no one should wait Almost an hour to get a burger when the bar wasn't even busy. She said sorry about that and walked away. Horrible waiting for average food and horribly handled by management. We will not be back.",

I am a huge fan of their onion ring tower, but by the time my hubby and I split one of those, we never have room for the burger and fries. I asked our server if it was possible to sub the small order of rings for the fries with our burgers. BTW, you can do that for a $1.49 charge. Totally worth it.   I ordered the whiskey river BBQ burger, medium, with the onion rings. Burger was cooked perfectly. Onion rings maybe could have been pulled about 15 seconds earlier. Not too big of a deal, just a smidge darker than usual, but certainly not burnt.   Our server, Tony, was awesome. Checked on us regularly, brought extra napkins without us having to ask, and got us some of that wonderful tea to go.  He was also very friendly and had a great attitude.   Definitely going back.",

    "text": "This Red Robin is 100x better than its sister restaurant at the Galleria Mall. It's like walking into a completely different restaurant, it's just decorated the same.   We visited on a Saturday night and got seated at the bar right away. I initially thought \"here we go...the bartender is also our server and he's going to forget about us\". Boy was I wrong. Our server came over right away and took our drink order. We weren't quite sure what we wanted for dinner yet so we started with the jalapeno coins and some french fries & ranch (their ranch is seriously like crack. I love it here. It's creaminess and consistency set it out from the rest). Our server accommodated us and got us our apps hot & fresh right away! P.S. their strawberry lemonade is heavenly, has fresh strawberries floating in it and has unlimited refills. YES!  I did notice that Red Robin had a newer menu. It's more condensed and organized, which I found helpful, as their last one was like a bible. So thick and took forever to get through. My fiance chose the Royal Red Robin Burger which is like breakfast on a bun - meat, cheese, an over easy egg, bacon, mayo and garden. I chose the Crispy Chicken Burger - just chicken and cheese only. When our food came out we were excited to see our fries presently beautifully in a little medal cylinder. It made it look like a fancy dish....not just scattered amongst the plate. My fiance's burger was cooked perfect and he enjoyed it (more like inhaled it! lol). My chicken sandwich came out with black bubbles of cheese and was burnt :( The bartender took control of the situation and got me a fresh one right away. It was juicy, tender and flavorful the second time around so I was a happy camper. My fiance really enjoyed the spicy dipping sauce that came with the jalapeno coins. He kept dipping his burger in it and asking for more :D   For dessert we ordered the Mud Pie. It was delicious, tasty and they put extra hot fudge in the dish for me. YAY! The cookie crumb crust was delightful!  I vowed never to eat at RR again after my terrible experience at the mall, however due to the Eastern location AND their great customer service....we will be return customers now. Just only to this one!",

I don't know why but I was hooked on their seasoning for the fries!   They usually have my favorite beers on tap depending on the season, Sam Adams seasonal. Which is another addd bonus. I don't usually come here during Happy Hour but when I do, I switch out the lemonade for the beer!   I haven't had bad service here yet and they're pretty quick, even when I was with a party of 10. All of us ended up getting freckeled lemonade and we cleaned them out of glassware! Didn't know that was possible, we were quite entertained by it.   My only real complaint is that if you don't pick your times right, you'll find yourself in a very loud resturant with a lot of children who don't behave. Some screaming and yelling around like they're the only ones there. I love children but not when they're misbehaving out in public places ._.;; Otherwise it's a great place to just chill with friends",

My husband always order the refillable root beer float (which comes in a huge mug, which really doesn't matter since it's refillable). This particular time my son and I ordered Very Berry Raspberry Limeade and Freckled Lemonade. Normally they come in little glasses that we end drinking right away. This time our waitress brought them in normal soda glasses right away. Which we loved. Not only did we not have to keep bugging her for refills but she didn't have to keep running and getting them. The only downside this time (hence the loss of 1 star) was my son and husband both added on chili cheese fries to their meals (instead of the regular fries) for an extra charge. We just assumed that they would be bottomless just like the regular fries. However, when we got our refill on fries they were just normal fries. The price they paid was definitely not worth the little bit of chili they got on their first set of fries. Next time we'll just get regular fries.",

Of note, you can substitute the bottomless fries for other items for free and certain items for a small extra charge ranging from broccoli to sweet potato fries. The burger is also customizable such as what type of bun among other things. Signing up for their loyalty card does win you a free burger in your birthday month every year and other discounts & offers throughout the year. The most recent visit, my friend & I had a very helpful and attentive waitress named Medina I believe? If every visit yields good results I will keep coming back when the urge to eat a whole lotta fries hits.",

I check my bill and the server added the extra salsa I asked for at $2 each. I have never had to pay for any extras. I waited for about 10 minutes from pressing the call server button for him to come and check on us. The manager came by and she wants to give the excuse that all locations should be charging and all that. As a manager, you should take the extra charges off and apologize.

The sweet potatoes fries were bland and soggy. Half of my bun was soggy. We live less than a mile from here so there's no excuse for soggy food that is luke warm. Bad customer service and soggy food...We won't be going back!",

    "text": "I'm usually down for Red Robin as I love a good burger, but my recent visit to this location had me running for the door.  Red Robin is great spot for some pretty decent burgers and chicken sandwiches. The bright colors and decor scream family friendly and they definitely go out of their way to please young children. (The TV in the floor is cool touch) On an average visit you will hear their rendition of the birthday song several times. Fortunately, there is a full bar and good happy hour for the grown-ups.   It had been a while since the last time I was here so I convinced some friends to check it out around lunch time. We were promptly seated by the host and greeted by our server, little did we know that this was going to be the last time we saw her. I decided to get my usual, the peppercorn burger and onion rings to share. After we made our selections, we waited for our server to return... and waited and waited and waited.  About ~20minutes later one of the bussers came over looking confused and asked if someone had helped us. He acted like we had just taken menus from the front and just sat down randomly. Soon after a new server appeared, for whatever reason she seemed annoyed that we were there; as if we had done something wrong. For whatever reason our food came out in waves; after the onion rings I was the first to get my food. We were expecting the other two dishes to come our soon but they took almost 30 minutes. My friend who ordered the bruschetta chicken sandwich was brought out the fish and chips instead, I have no idea who they mixed that up. They brought out her correct order later but our other friend and I were long finished with our food. My request for an additional serving of the \"bottomless fries\" also seemed to have been quickly forgotten as well.   Not sure what we did to deserve the neglect but it sucked.",

Devon (with the Disney D!!) was our waitress, she was amazing. She was joking with us all night and was right on it with the refills. We have never left a 25% tip before but she really made a good impression for this new city. We will definitely be back to this location because of her. The food was amazing too. Thank you Devon!",

We got the jalapeno coins (which I will probably get again next time I'm back) and the onion rings. Both were actually pretty good. I probably enjoyed those more than my burger and garlic fries.  I used to come here years ago for garlic fries but it doesn't seem up to par this time. Granted, it's been a few years, or maybe they were kind of soggy or maybe the appetizers filled me up already. It just didn't taste quite the same.  I split the burger (prime chophouse?) with my friend cause we can't finish one whole burger. To be honest, we didn't even finish our half burger nor our fries. The drinks and appetizers get to me every time!",

The glass they serve it in i guess is supposed to be fun but it was kind of awkward.  The sandwich I ordered came prepared wrong. I got a sorry and we could make you another from the server. Maybe half off the lemonade would have been nice? Was in a rush so that was not an option.  The sandwich itself the Chicken Bruschetta was a little rubbery and the produce on it was terrible making the sandwich pretty un-enjoyable.  I would have given a two since the food came out wrong and was not too terrific,  but the staff was very nice about everything.  I'll wait a few years and try it again",

So today when I went in there, they tried to serve me a red Raven double with egg on it. You can obviously tell the difference in the two burgers based on size. I eat there all the time. When I told them to take it back, the manager came out and yelled at me in front of other people saying it is the royal burger, which it wasn't. When I tried to explain that I know the difference between the two, she began to immediately yell \"call the police.\" I was so embarrassed, I wasn't yelling or causing a scene at all, and she yelled for her staff to call the police out loud so everyone could here. I'll be sharing this review for everyone I know on Facebook and on Instagram. They should be ashamed of themselves. What happened to the customer is always right.",

    "text": "A group of co-workers and I showed up for an end of the year lunch (we work for CCSD) and we were at our table, sat and talked to at 12:55 pm. I kid you not, after an hour of waiting for our food (thank God for Facebook time stamps on posts) our server came to the table and told us that our order was only showing 22 minutes on the ticket, and all of their managers were working in the kitchen.  As a former server, I wanted to give him he benefit of the doubt, after all it was busy and he and everyone else was obviously in the weeds too.  Two people from our party of 8 had to leave, so they obviously didn't get their food.   About 10 minutes later our food started showing up slowly.  My order in-particular came last.  I'm not upset that it took terribly long, I'm disappointed in how the management handled our experience. The server has no control how fast the kitchen turns tickets.  With that being said we saw 2 different managers who tried to be accommodating, however instead of asking if there was anything else we needed, I feel as though they should have comped the ENTIRE bill, not just 2 burgers.   Poor management style in my opinion.  Now don't think that we didn't take care of our server.  He still made 20% off of our table (before food was taken off, etc.)  Bottom line, going to Red Robin? Be prepared to wait a LONG time and be disappointed in how management handles it.",

We ALWAYS requested him. Just found out that he's no longer there. We had kept asking for him when we came in they would tell us he was off. He was great! Always had excellent service with him. You never had to ask for anything. The second time we had him he remembered us and our order and was such an awesome waiter! Our previous visit had been with Jessica and it was terrible. She was the worst waitress ever service-wise and had an attitude when we questioned a charge that was on our bill that we never get charged for. My husband and I order the same thing every time we go there. Food is not great and neither is service anymore. No reason to go back! Going to have to find another burger joint.",

That said, I can't remember the last time I went to one and it seems like they've made several changes: menu has expanded to offer a premium line of burgers and they have more chicken sandwiches, salads, and other non-burger entrees. There are also a lot of customization options from buns to fry sauces (some with an upcharge) and \"premium\" sides that I don't recall from previous visits.  The Bleu Ribbon burger was decent, with fried onion straws and a good amount of cheese. I upgraded my fries to the garlic-parm version, which were just a sprinkle of fried garlic and a pinch of cheese added to the regular steak fries- the flavor was pretty subtle. Note that burgers here must be cooked to at least medium, for some reason.  Service at the bar was adequate and one guy in particular was especially outgoing. All seats/tables are provided with a touch screen to summon your server, review featured specials, or play games while you wait. I'm all for using tech to streamline services but pushing a button to summon the bartender right in front of you is just weird.",

It took a few minutes to get seated and they were not that busy.  :(  However, the food is awesome, with great variety, and very tasty!  Yum Yum Yum!!!  I had the fish n chips!!  So Good, you will love it.  The staff is very professional and our server Jen was incredible, very personable, always checking on us, kept our glasses full, food brought to the table warm and in a timely manner!  The prices very reasonable and the restaurant was very clean!  Definitely a go for a nice family, friends, or even a party out!  God Speed!  Jake Out For Now!",

None if the order was wrong and he treated everyone kindly. It's hard to get that kind if service in Las Vegas we will definitely return cause of him.

The waiter was great, but the burgers took a really long time, and then they weren't very good at all! I ordered the Red's Double Tavern burger and the mushroom burger. Just two burgers and fries cost $24! I don't think I have ever eaten a drier burger in all my life!! Even when I dipped each bite in ranch, I had a really hard time choking half of it down. The other burger was just as hockey puck dry. I was truly disappointed,  since these burgers cost an arm and a leg, I thought they would at LEAST taste good. No seasonings, and I don't think that the mushrooms were fresh. Sadly, I would not recommend this restaurant.",

The burgers are now mediocre and the presentation is lackluster. The \"bottomless\" fries are now served in a tiny tin cup thing that gives you 10 fries at most which means you eat them in the first two minutes, and that leads to the reason for my low 2 star review. Service is less than adequate. The company in trying to save money has increased their servers work load to the point of ridiculousness. If you have 3 people eating and everyone eats at a different pace that means the server will have to refill each persons side at least once, that's minimum of three refills per table and if the server has 5 tables that's 15 trips to the back to get just refills on sides, not to mention taking orders, running food, refilling drinks and any other responsibilities they may have. This company has destroyed a good thing. I will no longer spend my money in a place that consistently frustrates me.",

The first server said that he would take care of us but after 5 or 10 minutes he did not return another young lady came up and asked us if we would like something to drink over the shoulder of my husband without looking at him, and gave us water. I asked for lemon and never got it. We also ordered my husband's burger no tomato and tomato was present on the burger. We also ordered my husband burger no tomato and to meet it was present on the burger. The food was otherwise absolutely delicious which is why it makes me sad to make this review. None of the servers that we spoke to introduce themselves or apologized for any inconvenience. After calling over a supervisor he also did not introduce himself but did apologize saying that they were \"swamped, and only had 2 servers\". Me being a server I can understand that. But none the less you can make the experience more personable. Like you're happy to have my business. Overall  1 star for the service, and 1 for the food.",

I asked him if you need a fork and knife to eat it and he told me no the chili was like glue and everything stuck together .My sandwich was ok the bottom was soggy  and you could tell it had been sitting for awhile . The french fries seem like they were cooked and left in a warmer for hours . I ordered a second batch of fries thinking they would make them fresh I was wrong same crappy fries. You also only get apparently eight fries with every order, but they claim endless fries. Needless to say I will never go back the food was crap as well as the service . Save your money and your time get a burger from Wendy's before you go here. They're just lucky there's no negative stars on these reviews. Their motto should be Red Robin run.",

    "text": "Ambience: There were six of us for dinner including two grandchildren ages 4 & 7. Showing up with 6 people for dinner at other restaurants has presented a major problem, not so at this Red Robin. Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded with people waiting, after just 5 minutes they seated us at a round table that was an appropriate size for 6 people. We were far enough away from other tables that we didn't feel like we were bothering people at the next table with our children and the other tables were far enough away from us that their kids didn't bother us. The restaurant provided balloons and crayons and paper to draw on for the little ones. This is a major asset. Food: you don't come to Red Robin for gourmet food. You come for good food at fair prices. The children's menu is fairly extensive. And it is reasonably priced. We had one mac and cheese and 1 grilled cheese sandwich. I sampled each and both were really good. It came with sides that included a choice of a couple of fruits or vegetables or the omnipresent french fries. I had the Southwest grilled chicken salad. The salad was fresh, the chicken was tasty, and they had fried jalapeno that were surprisingly delicious. The portions were large so no one left hungry. Service: our waiter came to our table fairly rapidly after we sat down. He took our drink orders immediately. He came back for a food order in a timely fashion. He got everything right. Service with a smile. I especially liked that the restaurant manager was present throughout the meal and stopped by our table at least 2 times to make sure that everything was going well. Overall, an excellent place to come with kids where both the kids and the adults can enjoy the meal.",

I love Thier fries but don't recommend the appetizers they are extremely small portions for such prices.",

If by itself it would still be too small and since its in a crowded little shopping plaza it flat out sucks trying to find the entrance and then a spot.   It was packed but we were sat quickly. Looking around I should have known we were in for a helluva night since everywhere I looked there were snot nosed little monsters getting high on soda and shakes.  One Little blonde girl started crying as we were sat and I felt sorry for the girl. That sorrow quickly turned to annoyance as the parental unit ignored the crying and it turned to ear shattering screams of pay attention to me!   The waitress saw us flinching and apologized for the noise and the long wait for our food saying it was busy tonight (37 minutes for our food and the musical accompaniment of that little blonde girl and her monster back up screamers).  Food was normal Red Robin,  the manager came over and apologized for the screaming kids and took our drinks off our bill saying he wished parents had the sense to take their kids outside when they acted like that. The waitress was on top of drinks and small talk so it wasn't completely a negative experience.   If we go back it may be in the day time to avoid the kids/scream monsters",

Servers lose their minds if you ask for anything out of the norm like \"do you mind if we sit somewhere that's not RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN?  Maybe in one of these 20 open booths throughout the restaurant?\"  Music is too loud, manager was actually on point and I was really impressed until I watched him and one of the servers set up a table for themselves in the middle of the dining area with full blown table cloth, gloves and several bags of \"hot and juicy crawfish\" from their competitor next door.  Indulging in their food while the rest of the servers gossip behind the counter. Can't make this stuff up.  Totally unprofessional in my opinion as I look around at the crayon all over the walls, garbage all over the ground, restrooms destroyed and tables from said server are completely filthy with dishes left from the last customer.  We've been burned at this same location twice before but thought we'd give it another go.  NOPE.  This place is garbage.  Head down the road to the galleria mall location if you want to enjoy a meal.",

You can feel the ickiness at this location. Despite the awesome updating of the Red Robin menu, they need to include today's dietary options such as keto. Although not a hard tweak for experienced dieters.  Our server was awesome. Very quick on drinks and refills. He made some awesome menu recommendations such as the Cado Burger? It was delicious!! I always order the amazing tower of onion rings. The dips are excellent.  The steak fries are usually delicious. But this time we could tell they were kept on a warmer and not fresh at all. Very disappointing Red Robin! Especially since I brought a friend from Belgium to test the fries.   No freckled lemonade for me this time. This is my cheat meal day. And still trying to stay away from straight sugar.",

What happened to the fun family atmosphere, delicious American food, and affording pricing? Everything went downhill when they remodeled and tried to \"upscale\" their restaurant.  The dining area feels very crammed. The tables are so close together it's hard to feel comfortable. I had to scoot in my chair numerous times throughout my meal and avoid getting elbowed by diners and waiters walking by.   Not only did the restaurant decor take a hit, the quality of the food did too. They raised their prices for food that's mediocre and has way smaller portions. I always order the Caesar chicken wrap and each time it gets smaller and smaller with less flavor. They advertise having \"bottomless fries\" which is awesome, but why bring a basket that can barely feed 2 when you have a table of 4? I totally understand you can order more, but save time and give us enough so we don't have to ask for more in a couple minutes.   On the bright side, the staff was friendly and attentive.",

Every thing tasted great except for the incinerated bread that came out with the salad I ordered. I really can't believe they would allow the bread to go out like that or that my server didn't notice she was serving it to me. Oh well...I had enough carbs anyways.   Only other complaint would be the board looking hostess when we walked it. Durning our visit a woman was yelling at her creating a HUGE seen calling for the manager.

FOOD - orange cream soda ($3.79) may be priced high, but it's bottomless and comes with whip cream and a cherry or two on top if desired - guacamole and chips ($7) comes with jalapenos on top, but it's not too spicy. Those can easily be scraped off. Also, additional chips and salsa come out too. Shannon brought our toddlers the extra mild salsa without us even asking. They loved it. - Whiskey River BBQ chicken wrap ($10.89) - so delicious when it's hot outside as this is a cold wrap. From their website:  \"spinach tortilla, grilled chicken, tangy Whiskey River BBQ sauce, Cheddar cheese, lettuce, tortilla strips and ranch.\" It was also larger than I anticipated. - kid's meals ($4.99 + $1.19 for a drink) come with bottomless sides  SERVICE The best in the Wild West by Shannon (see previously mentioned).  ENVIRONMENT Typical Americana-decorated Red Robin. Casual. Mostly clean - especially women's restroom at around noon on 6/4/18.  PRICE The bottomless sides & drinks will definitely have us returning. That's great value. Plus, if our server was an indication of all service at this location, then we are huge fans.   | Food: 5 | Service: 5+ | Environment: 4 | Price: 4 |  2018 Challenge #108",

Everyone's food came out together and tasted just like how I remember it from previous visits. So, I'm a happy camper.   However, I do have to mention that this restaurant is all over the place with it's customer service. Maybe I just came on a weird night, who knows? We walked in and I go to put our name in for a table. The two hostesses at the podium just ignored me. After a good minute or so, they finally look up and ask me what I wanted with a look of annoyance. Should of probably left, but we were all hungry so I decided to just move past it. I gave them my name and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table. Once seated, our server came. She danced her way to the table, told jokes, and was very outgoing. Which wouldn't be a bad thing at all, but she was really loud and made jokes about things that I was a little apprehensive about considering that we just met her.   Sometimes, you just want to have a nice relaxing meal and this location was definitely not the place for it. Between the grumpy hostesses and the overly friendly server, it was like a circus of emotions up in here. The things you do for unlimited steak fries.  Thankfully there's more than one Red Robin in this area, so I'll be skipping this location and going to the other one down the street where I can eat my mozzarella sticks in peace.",

Greeted by a lovely young lady who told us we could seat ourselves in the bar if we wanted a quieter table. Kiel our server was very friendly. Unfortunately that's where the positives ended. Our burgers took quite awhile to arrive. When they did, there was no dressing for the salad and the zucchini fries were ice cold. Our burgers were lukewarm at best, and yet burnt. They did replace the fries with a fresh batch but we were halfway through our meal  and by then our burgers were cold. We were looking for something more substantial than fast food but we would have been better off with a Whopper. Will not go back.",

I ordered a BLTA which is a croissant sandwich- I had marinara dripping down into & the side of my basket.  Ordered a double order of mushrooms & the majority of the basket was just tiny crumbs. Onion rings were dark & either overcooked or really old grease. Banzai burger was burnt.  Well understaffed. A lot of open tables yet you had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated. We elected to sit in the bar which is usually seat yourself yet we still had to wait even though there were only 4 tables taken. Really disappointed in what used to be our favorite go to place.",

Went for lunch and I had the Big Smokey Jack, which is an upgraded bigger patty. I loved the BBQ sauce and with pepperjack cheese, red onions, pickles and mayo, I was definitely in love with this buger. We added deep fried pickles served with campfire mayo and they did not disappoint!! The breading was crisp and stayed on even when you took a bite. Absolutely my favorite appetizer. My daughter had a Haystack Tavern Double and she said it was very good. She seemed to enjoy the pickles the most though. All in all a very great experience. Wonderful service from great staff.",

Anyway, I finally gave in and tried steak. Turns out, I LOVE beef. I started slow, but finally tried a hamburger for the first time about a month ago. I did not like it at all. Ground meat has a very odd texture to someone who has never eaten it before. It was a homemade burger. Fast forward to today. I had a gift card someone had given me, so we came in to check it out. We ordered the onion ring tower (awesome!), I got a bacon cheeseburger (huge!) with the garlic fries, one of my daughters got a burger and fries and my other daughter got the mac and cheese and steak fries (this daughter is vegetarian). I was terrified I'd hate it, but I totally get it now!!! That bacon cheeseburger has changed my life! It was simple, but exactly what I wanted. No, it was exactly what I NEEDED. I am now a fan of burgers, for the first time in my life. I'm very picky, so you can count on me to come back and order the same thing every time because I know it'll be great. I also need to mention that my daughter's mac and cheese was to DIE for! We live across town, and I almost ordered more to go so we could have it again for dinner.  Cheyenne was our server, and she was crazy busy, but super nice and really great, as was everyone else who helped us. The restaurant was very clean (except for a few greasy burger paw prints on the way out the doors lol), and the ladies room was also nice and clean (I cannot stand dirty bathrooms in food establishments).  Overall, we had a wonderful experience and will most definitely be back!",

I had the \"uber burger \". What a meal. It's very messy but awesome burger. The brat tops is nicely. The Ziosk was interesting. But I think you should not have to pay another $1.99 to play games.

Because of the wide selection, this Red Robin is sometimes my pick when I'm in the area and am hungry. Doesn't get too busy and service is always good here.  Their burgers are good, juicy, and the thing that sets any burger here apart is based on what you put on it.  I forget all the different types of burgers you can get, but they make pretty much everything.  The turkey burger is also good.  I tried the Oktoberfest Burger and wasn't too impressed.  I should have stuck to what I usually get, which is their Tavern Double.  So good.    Other Try's: -Cod Sandwich.  Not bad, but Bachi's ruined it for them.  Haven't found anyone that has a better cod sandwhich than Bachi Burger. -Patty Melt:  Okay, but small. You will wish you got a burger.   Now my favorite, their fries.  I prefer steak fries over regular fries, season fries, garlic fries, and onion rings.  Bottomless steak fries here.  My only issue is that they give you about 10 pieces.  It's bottomless, but c'mon. Hook it up the first time so I don't have to keep on asking for more.",

Most places wouldn't offer that right before closing time.   Still ordered to go and the food was delicious!! For anyone who loves sweet potato fries, get them here and order the Chipotle sauce on the side to dip with.

This particular restaurant is also famous amongst my family because one night I ordered the ghost pepper burger under the advice of the waiter because I told him I like spicy foods.  Problem was that I didn't know that ghost peppers are crazy hot.  I can not believe how hot this burger was, I could only eat 2/3 of it and tapped out.

But we stopped going as frequently a few years ago because they seemed to be slacking.  Or maybe other burger joints just got better?  Anyway, we went to this location 2 nights ago.  Fries were still good.  But they seemed to come out slower and in less quantity that I had recalled from my youth.  Also, the burgers seemed to be smaller and of inferior quality than I remember.  Balloons are no longer filled with helium.  Instead, you get balloons that are attached at the end of plastic sticks.    To me, it seems as if the bean counters got too much influence over the folks in charge of product quality.  We could be witnessing a slow death...  Mr. Red Robbin Chairman, please take this company back from the cost-cutters.  You cannot shrink your way to growth.  I might go back again some time.  But it will not be soon and it will not be frequent.  There are too many good options out there now.",

Just getting the order in took 10 minutes. We saw the pasta coming out of a microwave and they messed it all up and had to remake it. By the time it got to us 35 minites had passed. The food was ice cold and tasted horrible. We walked out.",

Place wasn't even half full, and there was a table, (clean) further away. Requested that table, he mistook one that was dirty and immediately replied \"I am not cleaning that table for you\" and walked away. Next, ordered spinach dip without onions. MANAGER delivered them to the table. Pointed out to her dip was ordered without onions. She asked if it was because of allergies, we responded no, just don't want onions. She gave us a nasty look and said \"Fine, we will fix it\"- when she returned with it, they had scooped out the center of the dip, covered it with a tiny bit of cheese and slammed it down on the table. Mind you we are in los of the kitchen.... so we saw it in action. Our food order sat in window for ten minutes, waiter and manager were giggling about it sitting there. Finally one waitress overheard our comment re be nice to get our order... brought it out, food quality was HORRIBLE. Chicken was old and rubbery- nasty. So, they get a star, not because they earned it, but because I can't  choose lesser value. Kenny- get it together, manager- take a nap or something- you are not a good example of quality service. It is no wonder why your staff are as poorly responsive as you are. Never again- matter of fact- considering call to corporate- so many more nasty little occurances, too numerous to list here. Stay away from this place, bad food, horrible service, lack of concern for the folks who patron this establishment. Have been to other Red Robins without issue- this place is awful.",

The service is overly friendly (reminiscent of a satirical movie - I can't remember if the server had pieces of flare).  Can't complain about that.  Hubs and I went with a bacony burger on special for $7.  He ordered more fries but never got them - good thing - 1 burger and fries is plenty.  Additional fries would have caused pain.    It's relatively cheap and it will definitely fill your belly.  Great place for kids.",

Now for the good stuff. They have a bottomless root beer float. Yes you read it right, free refills on a root beer float. That made my night over the top. It was a good float too not made with cheap ice cream and crappy soda. The food came out really quick and was prepared well. Everything was put together in a really nice presentation.

But it's very unpleasant for a burger. It was an all around bad experience but the reason I'm giving them a good review because we spoke with the GM Eric and he was so nice and listened to us. He actually ended up giving me all my money back which I did not expect. Like maybe a 10 dollar gift card or something, but no he actually refunded me. You go Eric.  two thumbs up",

Endless fries, which means the portion you get with your sandwich is small so make sure to ask for more.  The refill here was much smaller than what I usually get, but it was okay (I could've asked for more but I was tired).  Salad was ok enough, just wish the promotions were highlighted in the menu and not just the table tent - I hadn't noticed the special strawberry salad until after we ordered. :(",

With their ginormous burgers and bottomless baskets of fries, you will feel satisfied and ready for the self hatred that comes with it.   Walking past the first set of double doors, you will be greeted with a warm welcome and open second set of double doors. The hostess inquire about your day and lead you to your table. The interior is strictly classic American. It does not pretend to be a 50's diner, but gives you the feel of what I guess our country use to be.   The food is over abundant and fast. I normally prefer the whiskey river BBQ burger on a whole wheat bun. When I substitute the meat patty for a boca burger, I am still not disappointed. The last time I ordered their new menu item, the chophouse burger. It is delicious, but I felt my arteries clogging up. Overall, I enjoyed it, but do not remember everything that was on it besides the onion straws and the horseradish mayo. I think there was some sauteed mushrooms as well. It was tasty, but I would order my usual.  There are so many different tiers in the Vegas burger world. For being a family establishment that is unassuming and basic, I enjoy this for when I want something simple or classic.   The best part about this location, if you don't despise your weak will, you can always walk over to the Cupcakery for the K.O.",

I'm so tired of the crispy grease sticks all the burger joints have these days.  Second, it's all you can eat.   'Nuff said.  I usually get the bleu ribbon burger.  Good sized patty, a little pink on the inside.  Bleu cheese and onion straws.  It's delicious.  I also get the girly strawberry lemonade.  It's unlimited refills, and it's awesome.

I had a really salty burger, with the \"unlimited\" steak fries - fyi, you don't really want to eat that many, so that's probably why its unlimited. I thought the fries were just okay, maybe I had a bad batch, since everyone says the fries are good.

We are often seated, then ignored for 15 or 20 minutes because the wait staff doesn't know who has our table.  Tonight we watched 3 tables seated after us give their orders without anyone even greeting us. Finally I walked into the kitchen and demanded they serve us. We've had wonderful service since, so it's clear the problem is with the management, not the servers",

Host led us to a table in a very busy section when there were 2 or 3 empty booths available. Requested to be seated in a booth and host gladly obliged. So far so good. Our server was pretty good, too, although I had to remind him of the milk (which he forgot) and another order of fries. The only thing that was kind of disappointing was the breadsticks that came with the meatballs (Kids Meal). Was expecting real soft bread - the kind you'd see at Italian restaurants (I know this is fast food) - instead what arrived was those pencil-thin breadsticks that was broken into pieces. The meal didn't look like what was pictured on the menu. The Chicken Tortilla soup wasn't hot either. Other than that, everything was as expected. I'll probably stick to the burgers next time after all this is a burger place.",

Sometimes you just need some fries and campfire sauce :) -- If you haven't had this stuff yet, do it. It will change your life.   Great for family dinners or dining with a mixed crowd. Good selection of burgers, salads, chicken burgers, and other tasty options. I'm also a pretty big fan of their specialty drinks, but sometimes they can go terribly wrong.   Favorite dishes include: Whisky river BBQ burger (the chicken version is pretty good too - both are delicious when lettuce wrapped), Clam Chowder, fries, garlic fries, sweet potato fries, mango margaritas, and the mud pie.",

The manager told me that it was their dinner rush in the restaurant and she would have to call me later. I never received a phone call and never got my order complete, the order I paid for.

The menu stated \"bottomless steak fries\" so I figured there would be a ton of fries, but they were just placed in a container that was \"bottomless\" ;;;,,,,444774haha. All in all my burger was great.   My boyfriend and I got here at around 6:45-7:00pm on a Thursday and it was very busy with large groups and families. We only waited for about 5 minutes to be seated. Vanessa was our waitress and she was absolutely sweet and attentive to our needs. This place also sings Happy Birthday to customers if their birthday was on that day. There are no Red Robbin restaurants back in Hawaii, so thought I'd try it out and ended up liking this place.",

    "text": "First and foremost this rating does not reflect the quality of the food I've had but the management or at least one manager.   I called in and ordered a free birthday burger I had earned. After picking up the burger which was a veggie burger and getting home ready to eat it and realized that I had been given a BBQ bacon cheddar burger. I then called up and spoke to a manager who was super nice and told me to come back up and they would remake the burger and comp me a free dessert. Great I thought, well I ended up not making it back up there (long day at work and I was tired).   Fast forward to today, I make it back up there and bring in the incorrect uneaten burger to show. The manager who I spoke with the night before along with another manager who already seemed to have some sort of attitude. She told me that I'd just get the burger but no dessert. Anyone who has ever ordered from RR knows they tell you it takes 15-20 minutes for any of the burgers and fries to be prepared. The female manager came out in LESS than 5 minutes with the burger.   Obviously she couldn't be bothered to remake a fresh burger for me and the free dessert I was told I'd receive as well. I get it, some will argue and say \"But it was free anyway\", well I'd hate to see how things would've been handled had I paid for it. As a manager you can't be mad for a mistake one of your employees made when boxing up the order or that I did not come in again the same night. What if I didn't have a car or had the luxury just to come whenever? Bottom line is this whole situation was not handled appropriately and now I have two burgers I can't even eat.",

She was attentive, nice, and a pleasure to be around.  The manager came to our table to check if everything was alright, and it was! She also came back a little later and helped us with an issue we were having with the tabletop POS. Two other gentlemen also stopped by our table and they were awesome too.  The food improved since last time I was here. The bottomless fries were hot and fresh. We ordered a few baskets of those, they were great. My burger was excellent as well and it was cooked to perfection.  All in all, Red Robin on S. Eastern has improved!! Thanks to all the staff for picking it up!!",

    "text": "Love Red Robin, Burgers are not super high end, but consistently good.  They have a new item on the menu, Poutine.... that I really dig.  It is not quite the same as the traditional Poutine you may have had in Canada, but it is really good...and with their garlic Aioli, it is perfect combination.   Can't beat bottomless fries either!         This time specifically,  one of my kids choked on something and ended up throwing up.   The staff and manager was excellent to deal with... they were so helpful at cleaning things up and making us feel comfortable.    Additionally, the last time we were eating here... we saw a mother and daughter eating.  The daughter was probably 9-10.  Her mother got sick and went into the bathroom.  You could see the little girl was nervous sitting there on her own.  The manager came over, sent a female staff in to help the mother, got the little girl comfortable and helped them to get their food packed up.  Very caring.",

    "text": "We've lived in the area for over a year and this was our first visit to this Red Robin. Reading the reviews I wasn't really sure what we were going to get but this ended up being such a great experience!  Granted, we went at around 8pm on a Monday night, so the place was pretty slow. In fact, I believe there were maybe 5 other tables occupied in the entire place.   So when we first walk in, we are greeted at the door and seated by the greeter and less than 2 minutes later we are greeted by our server, Steven. We order our drinks and Steven mentions a few suggestions since we had mentioned this was our first visit here. Upon his recommendation I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger(10.49), while my friend ordered the Chili Cheese burger (9.99). Both burgers came with \"Bottomless steak fries\". They do give you the option to switch those out with a different style of fries, if you wish. We stuck with the steak fries and figured we'd just go with that.   I had been craving a burger all day, so sinking my teeth into that tasty burger was sweeeeet! Very fat and juicy! Plus I love the over-easy egg on top! That was the first time I had tried that on a burger and I definitely enjoyed it! The steak fries were the thick cut variety (which I love) and were pretty tasty as well. After 2 servings, that seemed to be plenty for me. My friend seemed to thoroughly enjoy his chili cheese burger and also indicated other burgers on the menu he wanted to try out on future visits.  The service was great! It was perfect that Steven was attentive and brought refills in such a timely fashion! He repeatedly checked in on us and attended to our needs during the meal. Just because a place is slow doesn't necessarily translate to great service. Trust me, I've experienced that first hand many times. But that certainly wasn't the case here! In fact everybody here was so friendly, we even had 2 other employees wish us a good night as we were heading out of the place. We were both like, \"Damn\"! lol   I honestly can't think of a reason why this wasn't a 5 star experience. It was pretty much a flawlessly pleasant experience and we will DEFINITELY be back for multiple visits! I just hope future visits are as good, they've set the bar pretty high for themselves.  So, based on my experience, I have to give Red Robin..  5 stars!",

All went well with seating and hostess was really nice and helpful!!  The server did a fine job but did have other tables so he was pretty overwhelmed and forgot items...but we totally understood how busy he was so that is not really the issue.  The issue I have was with my order.  I ordered Chicken Wings and French Onion Soup.  The soup was seriously served in a small saucer with very little soup.  The bread had soaked up all of the soup and the saucer was so shallow that there was no soup left. Seems like a strange choice of a dish for soup. I would recommend serving it in a BOWL or at least a ramekin so that there is soup instead of just bread soaked with soup and cheese. I returned it and would warn against anyone ordering that soup in the future....it is not worth it.  The fries were also pretty limp after asking for them to be extra crispy. It was just a Meh experience.",

My fiance and I came here the other day before seeing Jurassic World down the street. He ordered a Hawaiian Burger and I ordered a Chicken Ceasar wrap like always.  Everything is going great until our food comes out and there is no dressing in my wrap. (Insert sad face) just a dry bed of lettuce, tomato, and a few pieces of chicken. I let our server know and he apologized and had them make a new one. The only problem is now my fiance has his food and his is getting cold because he of course doesnt want to be rude and eat while im waiting for mine so now were both in a lose lose situation.  The manager brought out my food and was very nice and i really do appriciate that, (Another reason this is a two star review and not less)  So I start to eat my wrap and the first half I ate was almost completely empty. Like one tiny square of chicken and a little bit of lettuce. It might as well of been an empty tortilla with dressing in it.   The worst part for me was when I bit into my second half and almost broke a tooth an a huge hard chunck of what I can only guess to be bone or cartilidge...   That honestly ruined the entire meal for me.   For ever.",

With that being said, the manager (Blake) stopped by shortly after I began my meal, to ask how everything was. I said their signature cheeseburger and fries were great but mentioned that the Sangria was not so great. I had consumed about a third of the Sangria and it just tasted like flavored water.  He simply said \"I'm sorry\" and walked away. I always give management a chance to make it right. I ALWAYS mention the result of that, good or bad.  Nick, my waiter was great and I let him know that I wasn't happy and that I did food reviews for a hobby.  The manager stopped back by and said he never \"comps\" alcohol. He said I had consumed most of it, which I did, but had he offered a replacement (or something) the first go around, I probably would have left happier.  I've had alcoholic beverages with meals before, that were \"off\", and management has always made it right.  I'll probably come back because the food is great. I'll pass on the alcohol next time.",

My wife and I decided to give Red Robin another try since we hadn't patronized the place in years.  Needless to say we should have followed our first mind and eaten some place else.  I ordered a burger and my wife had the fish and chips based on the recommendation of our waiter Shannon.  Turns out, both entrees were tasteless and flavorless.  As for the endless fries, our waiter Shannon seemed as though he was in charge of rationing out both fries and refillable soda.  We had to ask for both despite the fact our glasses were empty, as well as our basket of fries.  Perhaps he was having a bad day.  My wife suggested that I only tip him 15% but I still opted for 20%.  Our total bill after tip came out to over $46.00.  Take it from me, there are much better restaurants in the local area where you can get a delicious burger for far less than the price we paid.  Interestingly enough, I was just reading an article about restaurants people hated and guess which chain showed up as #1,......You guessed it,.....Red Robin!!",

They underwent a remodel recently and I think it looked better before, but that's beside the point.   The burgers are still yummy, the service is still good and that freckled lemonade still makes my day. I'll put three of those away and not get tired of them. If you ask me, part of the fun is trying to scoop out the strawberries with your straw.   The one thing I wish they hadn't done was put the steak fries in these small metal holders so they're all standing up instead of having a little mountain of them nestled next to your burger. In an attempt to \"fancy it up\" your burgers now come with fewer fries but don't let that stop you from ordering a second round. They are bottomless after all.",

I went here with my parents and i first had a question for the hostess about whether or not I was able to hit my e cig inside the restaurant.. The hostess replied \"I don't know?\" And that was it... Usually when a service employee responds with \"I don't know\" it's usually followed by \"but I'll be sure to find out\". Never happened.. Secondly it took eight minutes for my family and I to be greeted which as you service people know to a consumer is like a lifetime..thirdly my beer glass came out with two different lipstick marks...niiiice...fourthly some random food runner, BOH trained dropped our appetizer off with his gloves still on, then proceeded to leave as quickly as he came without asking if this was what we ordered or if we needed anything else.. Lastly we received our to go food, perfectly bagged with appropriate sauces on the side as we asked..come find out later there were like 7 fries for my order.. For a place that let's everybody and their mother know about their endless fry baskets, I guess those who order food to go are subject to the cutting food cost method of skimping on to go orders... Final note  .. I gave 2 stars because our server was polite and none of my issues besides the fact that the greeting took quite a long time was her fault..needless to say STEP UP YOUR GAME LAS VEGAS MANAGERS!!!! Foh and BOH starts and ends with you!!",

My son rides a bicycle everywhere and Red Robin's not too far from our home, but not right around the corner either...  The soup arrived just hot enough to be palatable and tasty, no burning of the tongue and not so cold that I had to re-heat it in the (ugh) microwave in order to enjoy it.   To my pleasure the soup was topped with the traditional crusty bread slice and a thick slice of cheese that was melted perfectly - slightly gooey yet chewy too just the way its supposed to be, IMHO. The broth was just a bit on the greasy side but that's probably where a lot of the incredible flavor comes from.  The onions floating in the soup were cooked just a bit more than crisp-tender so they weren't soggy and slimy but rather kept their form and texture without that raw onion bite I detest so much. The soup came with pita bread doused in garlic and cheese sprinkles.  Yum, my tummy was not just satisfied but ecstatic and (in case you wonder) the soup stayed exactly where it was meant to stay, in my stomach... my apologies if you're eating a meal whilst reading this and have a vivid imagination...",

    "text": "5 star for service: We were first greeted by a Gentlemen, I believe manager. I didn't catch his name but he was very personable. His welcoming was not robotic and for the 1 minute he spent with us... we knew the restaurant was well managed. He also made sure we had a booth that we requested so extra plus for that. Momentarily we were greeted by Katy, our server for the evening. She is.... so.... good. She's happy, and you can genuinely tell. What impressed me the most though is how the colleagues interacted with one another. They tell each other Thank you and excuse me. Without a good team environment, you can't offer great service- they've obviously nailed both down. We came at a busy night.... sat down for about an hour and there were 4 birthdays around the restaurant. Came during Tuesday night 6-7. ( I really hope my server name is Katy lol... If not she is the blond, thin, tall, and nice of course!)  4.5 for food: I ordered the A1 peppercorn burger, as I love A1 sauce. The flavors are definitely there. My friend ordered the whiskey river bbq burger... now that's one delicious burger. it's worth the calories, take my word! Only order that if you love bbq sauce just an fyi. I ordered the sweet potatoe fries for an additional cost and that was very good too. Only reason why I gave -.5 I request for medium rare... meat was completely cooked through. Maybe cause the patty is quite thin or while it was sitting on the warmer plate it may have cooked on its own.  This is my first Yelp review I am writing so thank you red robins for a great dinner. Definitely good for casual eat and for families with kids. (They have beers too ;) ) definitely will be back again.",

I asked for a new seating location she stated that \"we still have to clean it\" okay ? Well why didn't you guys clean it before you sat us? Presentation here is horrible, very upset so far.",

I'm not sure why such low reviews, I'm greeted immediately my food comes promptly and hot! Some how I always end up with the same waitress Jena, she's great, very patient and gave the best recommendations for a burger my first time around. Even the manager comes over to make sure we're satisfied and full. The drinks are fresh too I have Shirley temples every time and they're always fresh! Meaning it doesn't taste syrupy or as if the machine and or pump is dirty! All in all I LOVE this place! Great crowd and super polite team:)",

    "text": "Came here tonight and it was the epitome of \"Meh, I've experienced better\" which is why I am rating it as such. We also came here before grocery shopping as I make note not to shop on an empty stomach after my $150 Whole Foods extravaganza of 2010, and because I was lazy due to not being able to cook with no food, thus we came here. I wish I would  have known what was coming or else I would have taken the effort to make a much more satisfying meal at home.   As a vegan, there are very few things I can order and I do not think my order is too complicated in the least, but our waitress just did not get it right. In fact our waitress is the reason why this visit was especially horrid. We had to ask for EVERYTHING, while waiting forever to ask it as she disappeared at full-on ninja status most of the evening. We had to ask for silverware, ketchup, refills; the works. The burger I had did not come out with how I ordered it, and when they did get it right it was just - bland. I know that they microwaved my Boca patty which is fine, but I felt like they microwaved the mushrooms I had on top as well. They were supposed to be sauteed! It was not a satisfying meal, and we were also there for an hour and a half. A meal like that should not have taken so long, but our waitress was nowhere to be found for a majority of it.   The service and quality is usually decent, but tonight it was horrific. It really makes me not want to go back anytime soon. Next time I will break my rule and shop first, cook later. The headache from this visit was not worth the effort I would have put into a much tastier meal at home.",

    "text": "Me: Where do you want to eat for dinner tonight? 4 year old: McDonald's!? Me: Nope. Where else do you want to eat? 4 year old: Red Robin!! Me: Alright  Per the kids' request, we visit Red Robin every one to two months. They like it because of the miniature arcade in the front, balloons, crayons, and kid's menu/coloring page/activities. I like it because it is always super loud so no one can hear when my 1 year old gets fussy or when my 4 year old isn't using his inside voice. All of the craziness at my table blends in with the ruckus of the remaining restaurant into one big, happy, burger-eating union.  I'm sure you know that they give you unlimited steak fries, but did you know that for $0.99 extra, they will turn those into Garlic Parmesan fries? I'm quite certain they use garlic out of a pre-minced jar and pre-shredded parmesan, but they are still delicious. Make sure to ask for their ranch, which is scrumptious, and the perfect pairing for their fries.   My husband and I usually share the guacamole bacon burger which is a decent burger. I honestly can't say it's much better than the one from Carl's Jr. but we're paying for the atmosphere and bottomless fries. Our bill usually comes to around $20 for an appetizer, burger, and kid's meal. For a family of 4, I think this is a bargain. Red Robin wouldn't be my first choice to fulfill my burger craving, but it does a decent job and my family loves it so we will continue to frequent this place.",

I know it was from there because I did not have much to eat yesterday and I doubt that my apple caused it. And it was right after we finished dinner and the stabbing stomach pain and sweating began. As soon as I arrived home, it was in full effect. My husband called the manager while I was \"indisposed\" and was told that everything was served \"at temp\" and that it pretty much isn't their problem. My husband got food poisoning from there a few months back but we thought that maybe it was just a fluke. I'm guessing not.

I had fruit flies in my drink and pointed it out to the server.  I told her that's ok I will just drink water.  5 min later she came back with a drink.  I told her I didn't want it and she said that the manager told her that I would still have to pay for the drink so she had a new one made.  I asked her if they used a new bottle and she said yes but she wasn't a very good liar.  So I told her to show me the new bottle. She went to the bar and the bartender shook her head, called another employee over and held the \"old\" bottle up in the air and quickly lowered the bottle and turned away from us.  The server walked back over and said that the manager would take the drink off the bill.  I asked her how many other bottles had flies.  \"They wont hurt you they are just fruit flies\"  was her shocking reply.  Apparently these employees haven't been trained on health codes. We immediately cancelled our food. Put $5 on the table for the soda my friend had and walked out.  An employee comes out after us and asks if we were leaving.  We said yes and she told us to never come back.  We told her NO PROBLEM.  Then she said she was going to call the police and make us pay for the fly infested drink and the food we didn't get.  LOL  We waited in the parking lot for 15 min. and no cops ever showed up.",

Tonight when my boyfriend and I visited, the service was outright terrible. (Although it was more the server's fault than the restaurant itself.) Our waitress was Megan. Our appetizer took forever to come out and when we finally got it, it was obvious that it had been sitting for a long time. We also ordered more fries while we were waiting for our appetizer that we never received. When I finally got my $15 burger, it was completely overcooked and burnt even though I asked for it medium rare. By the time my burger was fixed, I didn't even want it anymore. There were multiple times throughout the dinner when we had to ask other servers or management to get our food because our server didn't check at all to see if it was ready. Basically we just wasted $60 on terrible food and a terrible evening. We will not be returning any time soon.",

After switching table our server took our drink order and appetizer order. Took him at least 15 minutes to bring 2 waters, 2 diets and 2 kids drinks. Serious?!! Our appetizers came out as he was putting our drinks on the table. Then he ordered one of the wrong appetizers. We finally ordered our lunch. almost 45  minutes later we still didn't have our food. We actually walked out because it was taking too long. The manager came over but he was questioning us about how long we were really waiting for. Really....horrible customer service!! I've never walked out of restaurant before. The service was terrible, the management did not seem professional and the restaurant was a disgusting mess. We were surrounded by dirty tables.

When we told him the number, he said politely \"give me just a few moments while we set something up for.\" He was super energetic and I could clearly tell he loved being there. When he walked up, we had a manager come over to ask if we had been helped, we said yes. I think he said his name was Matt. Plain blue shirt and no name tag. He started talking to us and I'm sorry but he was VERY arrogant. He kept on making the same jokes over and over. We laughed it off, but I was unimpressed. Our host Michael came back and said I have it all set up for you and I take you back now with a smile. We gathered the troops and headed back. He politely waited for us all to take a seat (and we we're long lol) but he had a good spirit and laughed with us as we tried to find our positions. Kameya was our server. And she was WONDERFUL! Very joyful and helpful. As we got our appetizers, Matt came back around to (again, sorry to say, BOTHER US!) He repeated the same jokes again. And I kept thinking, does he not remember us from 10 minutes ago!!! He stood there for about 10 minutes continuing to talk and I just grew tiresome. I was there to eat and enjoy with my family and friends that were in town. I understand that he was checking on us, but C'MON! We're smiling and laughing eating a tower of onion rings. Just leave us ALONE! We are having a good time. All in all, the food was great, Michael and Kameya were amazing! They even thanked us again for coming in as we were leaving! A++ But the manager Matt just grew on us to where we were ready to get up and leave. I have never been to any restaurant that I've had a manager come over and give up a 15 comedy sketch of unfunny jokes. It was just restless and annoying. Thanks RED ROBIN, but we're all consider a different location.",

    "text": "As a hunter for the perfect burger, and a 20 year cook, I have already realized that perfection is in the mouth of the beholder, and you really have to share the taste of chef who developed the combination in question. Today, I had the chophouse burger. It was different than most burgers I had tried, but well prepared and refreshing. I may even opt to have it again, so long as I am seated and tended to by a food server.      I have gathered that food service from 2000 to present has become disgraceful (compared to that of pre-2000) so I don't set my expectations too high when I dine out.      But eating at the bar was nothing short of piss-poor. I have queried 3 different employees on information of the a couple of menu items- 2 of which admitted that they were in the gray and my server- the bartender- said she would find out. It took her 12 minutes to retrieve that information. I had already finished one glass of water which was placed under a dusty tapper, which I wiped off myself (witnessed by another employee) before my order could finally be taken and sent back to the cook. I can understand her distress as she had to tend to 2 others who were sitting at the bar and keep up with after-work plans with her co-workers (said sarcastically.)       Before I finished my only round of fries (if I had been seated, I would have been offered a refill), I added an entree to go. Just a bit over five minutes later, she returns with my order, already bagged, and to any one else with a 5th grade education would have recognized that I had no other business but to pay for my food. She placed my order beside my two empty beverage containers and continued doing what she was doing- not wiping down service areas and gossiping with her cohort. Another 10 minutes had passed when she finally asked if I wanted to pay my bill. Duh! I would've waved her down for the bill, but I wanted to be able to justify her $1.16 tip, far more than she deserved.   I would have liked to hear her complain of the sickly gratuity, but I had already spent 1hr and 3 minutes for business that could have been resolved in 25 generous minutes.",

    "text": "I simply love burgers and love trying every burger that anyone has to offer.  Something new that I found here that nowhere else had was the Bleu Cheese burger.  The burger was good, not great.  The meat was salty, partly due to the bleu cheese, but that comes with the territory.  I don't blame them for trying.  Also, pay attention to the bread that your burger will be served on, as I got a jalapeno loaf, that was okay but dry compared to my girlfriend's normal sesame seed bun.    They have bottomless steak-cut fries, which I don't think too many people take up the bottomless offer.  Just think about large, unseasoned potato wedges.  But they do have their own seasoning on all the tables.  The staff are very friendly and service is excellent.  They refill your drinks with brand new ones when they see yours get down to half or less, at least our waiter did.  Also, very fun for birthdays as they sing and encourage the other patrons to join in.",

    "text": "We were really in the mood for a cheeseburger and wanted to give this place a try. What a joke.  I figured this was more of a restaurant vs a fast food chain. Well, it has restaurant prices but fast food quality. My daughter ordered a kids meal pizza. It came out in about 2 minutes (microwave) and was super soggy to where it was uneatable. My waiter sucked to the point where I had to ask a different waiter for service.",

    "text": "only two stars cuz the food tasted good. i had the bonzai, which is ok. i think the carls jr. teriyaki burger tastes better though. my bf got a royal red robin and it was ok for him too. we also had some coleslaw and mac n' cheese but they never brought out napkins and utensils. we asked for some and we got napkins but the guy said the utensils were being washed. we thought that was weird but w/e. halfway through our meal and we still didnt get it. when we finished, we sat around for probably 10 minutes before we were noticed. they gave us to go boxes for our stuff and asked if we needed our check but we waited another while before we got it... maybe the staff has memory issues or something... our server came by and asked us how we were doing and i mentioned that we never got our utensils so she apologized and told her manager. the manager ended up comping the whole meal so we didn't have to pay at all. i'd prolly go to red robin again, just not this location...",
