My husband always gets the modules frites which are delicious! Can not wait to try their brunch!  Had to change review unfortunately the last 3 times we have gone each time it has been a different chef and the food is terrible.",

    "text": "I am struggling a bit in giving Andre's a solid score, I wish they allow half stars. So based on the average score I'm giving them on customer service and food I've come to 3 stars. Here's why....  Customer service 2 stars out of 5. We got there around lunch time, so noonish. It wasn't busy yet, and in plain sight you can see there were plenty of runners and servers. We got seated and immediately greeted by a lovely lady offering us water.  Then our server came, Nick. He seemed loopy. And when I mean loopy, loopy that he was babbling and asking us what time it was \"what time is it, is it 3:30?\" And my husband and I looked at each other like \"it barely noon.\" What the heck? Then he proceeded to tell us we should have come at 3:30 cause they have daily happy hour and the pricing was way better. I admit they were, but we were already there, it just made us seem like he didn't want us.We ordered beignets for starters, lobster roll, burger and the souffle. The food took forever to come out.  I mean 20 minutes for 3 pieces Of beignets. Not sure if our server had put that order in as appetizer or what. I was also very peeved that they didn't clear our dirty and empty dishes and cups right away. The servers and runners were just hanging out at the bar and chit chatting, and passing our table. But never picked it up to clear our table. Mind you we sat on a two top table so all these extra empty plates and dirty dishes easily overtook our table. After introducing himself to us and getting our order we have not seen our server again. The last time was when we were wrapping up lunch, and asked us if there was anything else we needed. I said \"more ice please.\" (I'm 9 months pregnant and there was no air in the restaurant and I was so hot). My extra ice cup never came. . Not sure why there was a lack of service, but something definitely to work on.   Food review 4/5! There is no denying the food is amazing. Although the food did take some time to get to the table, it did come out hot and fresh. The food was amazing! Beignet was the amount of sweetness and savory. Omg the burger (very messy eat) had this umami and balance of savory, sweet, and tart which I inhaled. The fries.... duck fat cooked fries... enough said. For dessert the souffle was delicious. Granted could get it better elsewhere, but still did not disappointed and perfect end of the meal. Keep cooking good food like this, I will come back.",

    "text": "After reading positive comments from a local food critic, I decided to go and visit the new bistro. The host was very accommodating, polite, super courteous an overall great guy. We are a party of 4, we ordered 2 escargot appetizer and was surprised to find them very salty, we told our waiter and he quickly returned the escargots to the kitchen, after a few minutes he brought them back and we noticed that the escargot sauce was white sauce instead of garlic butter, the chef has added cream to the dish to tone down the excessive salt, it's was awful and also the dish was cold, the manager returned the escargot to the kitchen to reheat, he personally brought back the dish and was very apologetic, we all tasted the escargot and by now I could have used it to patch a hole in my car tire. The fries where also cold and that was exchanged, they of course removed the escargot charges from our bill. Overall, the place is nice, maybe that was a bad day as they just opened and are used to the tourist versus local crowed, I'll give them another couple month and then retry again.. We are foodies, we don't have the luxury of being recognized as some local food critics that get great tasting food.",

My meal started with a cheese plate and seared foie gras. This foie gras was easily the best I've had in my life. It lit up my mouth in places I didn't know I had. We had a beet and caesar salad respectively, the beets at this place are amazing, I don't normally like beets but they're amazing here.   Finally the entree, I had the golden trout and my partner the filet mignon. Everything was sincerely perfect and the waiting staff was on point. Exactly the right amount of service without being patronizing.   The desert was out of this world, the pastry chef is up to any bistro in France's standard. I'd come here again. Everyday if I could.   10/10, thank you Andre's!",

    "text": "We came here for my birthday brunch while we were in Vegas. It wasn't my first choice, because my first choice wasn't taking any more reservations. Not wanting to wait an hour for brunch, I searched yelp frantically and came across this place. The reviews looked promising and our group was mainly looking forward to eating chicken & waffles (which Andre's has) so we decided to check it out. The restaurant itself is very welcoming and cute. I really loved the decor from the ceilings to the floor, it was very cute and sleek. Our service was also great the entire visit. My reason for giving them 3 stars is for the food we received. 3/4 of my group ordered chicken & waffles. Although it didn't taste bad at all, the breading was falling off of the chicken and the waffles were completely falling apart. It just didn't hold together, which made it incredibly hard to eat. My bloody mary was also just so-so, and the beignets were tried were good but basically just completely hollow on the inside. For the price of the food and the vibe it looks like the restaurant is trying to give off, I just expected the food to be of better quality. Again, nothing was bad, but it just didn't impress any of us.",

    "text": "A friend recommended and brought me to this place, even tho I'm not typically a fan of French food.   Restaurant js a good size in a strip mall. We went about 6:30 on Saturday night and it was not very busy but not slow either. We were seated immediately. Service was fast waiter came right over to take drink orders and bring bread. Bread was very good.   The menu has a good variety of options of French food as well as some salads and \"American\" sides/ appetizers. Prices were ok a little on the high side but the restaurant looked to be presentable.  I had the Cobb salad and a side of sweet potato fries. Definitely get a large on the salads as the small is in a pretty small extremely shallow bowl and you don't get much salad (despite asking the waiter what the size of the salad was). Other than that salad looked and tasted fresh.   Fries were pretty soggy and portion was pretty small for $6.   The reason for this place getting 2 stars is, before I left I used the bathroom and it was DISGUSTING. Paper on the ground, garbage overflowing, feces in the toilet bowl stuck to the side, some brown contents all over the sink (see pictures) ... this tells me that If a restaurant can't keep a clean  public space such as a bathroom you never know what there kitchen looks like where the public doesn't see. It really turned me off and made me leave in disgust.  Won't be back.",

The place is nice and cosy, with kind of a Parisian design and atmosphere.  Food was OK, in a reasonable price range. The snails (yes, I eat snails and I loooove it!) were pretty tasteful, unlike some other places in town. On the other hand, I would strongly suggest they improve their service and staff. This was really disappointing. It took forever to get someone willing to take my order. Then they weren't aware of the prices for the specials of the day. Food took like 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen... Major progress to be done on this.",

    "text": "We were big fans of Andre Rochat's namesake restaurant at the Monte Carlo, so it was bittersweet when we heard of its closing. But the opening of Andre's Bistro & Bar in the far southwest corner of the valley is much more than a consolation prize - it's pure Parisian bistro fare in a contemporary setting, with neighborhood prices. It blew our minds how inexpensive the entire brunch menu was, with nearly everything under $20 and most entrees in the $10-12 range.  We started with an order of three beignets, served hot and pillowy with a dusting of powdered sugar. With a crusty exterior and an almost crueller-like interior, they were a perfect way to start the meal.  We then moved on to the pastry basket, which included a croissant, chocolate croissant, almond danish, raspberry (?) danish, and something called \"Mr. Sunny Side,\" which was a pastry with custard and apricots arranged to look like an egg.  Choosing a main was a difficult decision (thankfully the prices and location mean we'll be back early and often!) but I went with the smoked sausage, gruyere, and caramelized onion omelet, and it was perfect, all of the elements complimenting one another in one big eggy umami bomb. I did swap out my breakfast potatoes for frites (I mean, it's a bistro) and they were exactly what I was hoping for, crisp and flavorful.  Other entrees ordered at the table included a sausage platter, served with a warm potato salad, and a smoked salmon benedict. I didn't try either of them but my dining companions looked pleased with their orders.  Amid a flurry of great new restaurant openings in the Southwest, Andre's Bistro and Bar is poised to become a neighborhood institution.",

They got the clearing your plates and refill your water and asking if you want another glass.  That's about it.  They didn't bring you an empty bowl for your mussel shells if you do order that dish.   They didn't check to see or ask if you're done with your oysters and the escargots...we still had 2 left.  Food is ok, nothing I'm craving for since I ate there.   The other half of our table drank a lot... and ordered a bunch of things which I couldn't eat because of my food allergy.  So for me and my husband...paying $150-200 per couple is quiet a lot especially for ok food and service and off strip.   I rather go to the Rhino and spend that on Rhino platter, grill cheese, and shots.   We'll have to give this place another try for lunch and/or happy hour and that it's been months since they've opened.  It seems to be where this place is gets positive reviews from and mostly friends of the staff who are leaving superb reviews.",

The entree was two generous venison chops with a butternut squash puree.  The sauce was fantastic but the chips were a touch too rare.  The shaved Brussel sprouts were fabulous. Dessert was roasted pineapple with cheesecake ice cream.   Overall, a wonderful night of good food and fine wine in a comfortable private dining room.",

    "text": "We decided to give this place a try for my friends sending off before deployment brunch. The decor is nice and simple and they have a spacious covered patio. We opted to sit outside since it was a nice breezy day. At first the waitress seemed standoffish but after some time she warmed up to us.   We ordered beignets as appetizers and they were heavenly! Light and fluffy just how they should be made. They have two all you can drink options 1) is mimosas for 24 pp and 2) is the henny sangria for 25 pp. I thought if I paid 25 I could get either or for a nice little mix but I was sadly mistaken. Although the difference is only a dollar, you cannot mix between the two even if you opt to pay the more expensive option. Maybe they should include that as a choice for those looking to experience both.  Now I know you are reading this thinking wow, why only 3 stars everything seems great so far. Well, it's because of my main course. I ordered the Steak Frites and while presentation was to die for the steak was BEYOND bland! Not even the garlic butter on top could make up for it. Having a steak look so marvelous and be so tasteless is really an enigma. Fries were nice and crunchy but could not save this dish.   My friend ordered a lobster roll and enjoyed his food very much. Other friend had the chicken and waffles which he states wasn't very special.  I really wanted to like this place and have a new brunch spot but it looks like I will continue my search!",

    "text": "The food was good, and so was the service. The escargots were nice, and went well with the baguette bread. The seafood tower was not very impressive. It came with 2 pcs each of: fanny bay oysters, shrimp, king crab, snow crab, and a half of a lobster tail. It was good, but looked a little empty.. would be nicer on a smaller bowl presentation or added shrimp as a filler. However, for the affordability of the prices, I cannot complain. I loved the foi gras appetizer and opted to enjoy it with the wagyu steak. They went very well together. The lobster roll was delicious. Simple yet flavorful and filling. We ended the meal with the creme brulee and they surprised me with a complimentary berry plate with a sparkler and happy birthday written on a white chocolate square. It was very nice, and greatly appreciated. The service was attentive, but not overly intrusive. Which is what I love! Can't wait to come back and try different dishes",

They really have carved out the perfect definition of what I think of when I want some place nice, yet comfortable for a meal and wine that is a short drive from my house. The service is on point; we visit about 1-2 times a month or so and everyone is so friendly.  Everything on the menu is amazing and the wine selection is nice.  Their happy hour is a great deal, with a nice variety of discounted items from all over the menu included and $2 off wine by the glass. Plus their happy hour runs 7 days a week.  Some of our favorite things on the menu include the lyonnaise salad with the duck confit, the seafood platter, lamb burger, coq au vin, seared foie gras.  They have added more tvs, which is nice because we were able to watch the rest of the Golden Knights game the other evening.",

Good news is that DW Bistro moved down the street and even better news is this awesome restaurant is now in business.  First off, customer service was amazing. From the host to the server to our busser -- everyone was exceptionally kind and came around often to ask us how we were doing.  I ordered the lobster roll and HOLY MOLY, it was love at first bite. The lobster was seasoned just right and the roll was the right amount of buttery. And the fries that came along with the lobster roll were on point also.   Will definitely be back to try more items on the menu. Spoiler alert: this place is a tad bit on the pricier side, but it's totally worth it.",

On first impression, I liked the aesthetic changes they made as this space was formerly DW Bistro. (Not that DW wasn't also adorable.) Glasses of sparkling rose were clinked, and we took on the world from our table in the cozy back corner of the main dining room.   My friends both enjoyed lobster rolls (they looked good but a bit overdressed for my taste.) I ordered the Thai chicken burger - and folks - it was so clucking good!!  The ground chicken was delightfully seasoned and served on a PRETZEL BUN (Yass!!) with a delicious aioli and sauteed peppers. Duck fat fries were an option but I went with their lightly dressed mixed greens instead. It's been 24 hours and I'm still thinking about this burger, it's that good.   When it was time to order dessert, one of my friends placed her order for the lemon tart, and our charming waiter asked if we would all be sharing it--and we laughed and laughed. Two lemon tarts and a chocolate walnut gateau later and we were 3 very happy ladies.   The lightly bruleed lemon wedge was a citrusy flavor explosion, and the tart itself was to die for. I tasted the gateau and it was also heaven on a plate.  We might not have been able to solve all of society's problems during this lunch date, but I'm sure we will give it a go again in the future, and I'm already planning a trip back with my husband for dinner. Whoever said money can't buy happiness has clearly never eaten here.",

I dont even know where to start: the drink service was quick but pricey, the food service was slow and the food wasn't all that great when it did arrive. It's breakfast for goodness sake!!!! I honestly felt cheated for my time and money. I'll stick to Paris Baguette Cafe or DW Bistro which are both about 5 minutes east of here.   Our party of 14 were sectioned off so we couldn't gauge how busy the other side was, but it took over an hour for the food to come out and when it did it came out it came in spurts. A few people got their food and by the time they finished the other people got theres. It was a disjointed mess. At some points people from the party had to find the server and ask what was going on. She kept saying the same thing -\"its coming out\". We werent in a rush but at a certain point theres only so much you can drink and you start to notice how long youve been waiting. I thought about cancelling my order and cutting my losses.   The food arrived ONE HOUR and 15 MINUTES after ordering. During this wait no apologies, no visit from the manager, no comp pastry baskets. Nothing.  Just wait, wait and wait so more, pay and leave. No hospitality. No one even ordered a well done steak. Just eggs, a burger and a few salads. I was so disappointed when my food arrived. For one, I told the server specifically how I wanted the fried egg cooked and it came out over easy! I told her to cook it hard. The food came back made correctly in under 5 minutes. I was surprised because the entire order took over an hour! The Croque Madame was a sad dish to have waited over an hour for. I've had better at walk up cafes made in 10 minutes. This one was just a burnt piece of toast topped with a thin slice of ham, swiss cheese and bechamel sauce and a egg on top. Its typically a sandwhich with two pieces of bread and stuffed with ham and cascading with bechamel sauce, but these guys are apparently cutting costs. The top looked burnt, dried out and as if it's been sitting in the expo window for the better part of 30 minutes. The duck fat fries are NOTHING to write home about. Ive had better fries at McD's.   Also the bottomless mimosas are more than most entrees on the menu at a staggering $24.99. I'm not sure when the trend started to charge locals so much for cheap champagne bought at whole sale prices mixed with ready made orange juice. Not even fresh squeezed or even with a garnish on the glass.   While the server was nice i don't think she cared because she was getting an automatic gratuity. We all finished in 30 minutes and there we started the wait again as she scrambled to organize the checks. She had over an hour to get those ready.  Thankfully, i paid cash. Like I said I won't be back and I won't be sending any of my friends there or my guests.",

And we couldn't taste the ricotta.   Chicken sandwich- my husband said was weak, tasteless.  We asked for a side of truffle Mayo, there is something up with the truffle here I'm guessing the chef uses truffle salt?! It was salty!!!!   Pea Barley soup with truffle- the truffle smelled great but it was SOOOOO SALTY ! We sent it back.  French onion soup - that was yummy  Grand Marnier Creme Brulee- this was the BEST Part of the meal.  I may come back and try the weekend brunch but lunch was not what I expected.

    "text": "It was good but not great to where I would drive out of my way to dine there again. Maybe happy hour when the prices are cut in half.   I came here twice in three days-- once for dinner the second for brunch. I'll start with dinner.   My boyfriend says I'm in too much of a rush, but I just felt like service was sooooo slow. I'm all for having a nice sit-down meal but I think the first impression should be that you're getting the ball rolling as soon as the guests sit down. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes left little to be desired and were disappointing. My boyfriend had a filet cooked medium, but it came out medium well+. It was also really thin. When I think of a filet I think of a small but thick cut-- this one was simply flat. For dessert we ordered the apple tart which was underwhelming. We expected more of a crust which is usually the star, but there was hardly any which made us both pick at the apples and leave it alone.   On to brunch. My latte took a while to come out, and a left it unfinished which I can honestly say I've never done to a cup of coffee/espresso before. There was hardly any foam or steamed milk. The chicken & waffles were weird. The waffle is a cornmeal waffle (not expressed in the menu or else I wouldn't have ordered it) and it comes loaded with gravy. It was good, but not what you think of when ordering this particular dish. My boyfriend's eggs Benedict was so tiny. I'm not looking for American super-sized portions, but everything comes out meek and disappointing. Our dirty plates sat in front of us for a while before they were cleared.   The salmon was so good, and there were so many other desserts that sounded fantastic, that I think I need to give this place another chance before I decided whether or not this is going to be a regular place I visit.",

While I believe this place is typically better than 2 stars, I can't give it above 2.   -My lobster roll was quite tasty, but the star of the show was the way above average roll. The lobster was well seasoned but didn't taste fresh. Part of my side salad was wilted.   -My boyfriend got the creamsicle, and to me it was hands down the best thing on the table.   -My water glass on the table had a lipstick stain. No one noticed.   -The hostess literally dropped the wine list on the table... like the leaning tower of Pisa fell and crashed into the bread plate, extra flatware, and knocked the salt shaker over. And she just froze then bolted away! And we though \"good evening\" from her at 1 p.m. was weird.   - The croque madame was solid, and the best food item.   -The waiter was friendly, prompt, and on his \"A\" game.   -The single espresso is one of the best I've had at a restaurant on or off the strip.   -The ginger beer was above average.  -The bartender just stood around texting.   -The old-fashioned was by far the worst one that I have ever had. I've had some bad ones. Some that have tasted like a bottle of bitters; others that were shaken. Dear goodness, this was an all new low. Plus, I was never asked, which bourbon or whiskey I wanted. It was like drinking Kool-aid and Maker's Mark. So sweet that I took 2 sips and got a headache. Completely undrinkable.   I want to like this place. I used to eat at Andre's in the Monte Carlo. It was a well-deserved Michelin one star restaurant. This was like the disappointing distant relative to the original. Maybe it was because it was brunch, but I don't want to go for dinner with all of the service and cocktail issues.",

Peeps burgers and steak dishes were killed.  - Great portion for the price and good selection for lunch!  - Customer Service...as a team, they worked great together.  They even offer 10% discount on the next lunch visit with a receipt.  Cons:  - Customer Service...mixed up included green salad vs fries, but was quickly addressed and the fries was included at no charge.  Missed my lemons with my water and a bit slow on others refills.  They're new, just need more time to floss out the minor kinks.  - Fries was kind of salty...maybe it was just me having a low sodium preference.  - We were placed in the back of the restaurant when there was only two other parties there.  No biggie...just odd, but it worked out cause we were kind of laughing too much.  Stars:  - Luis G. provided great service!",

Gnocchi was okay but I wasn't wowed. Gnocchi was in one corner, peas in one and cheese on another. Service was good I just wish the food was properly executed. A glass of Sauternes, a glass of Rose Champagne and 2 course meal plus tip $90. Hopefully Andre's will step it up their food game.",

The ambiance is classy, the food is amazing, and the service is excellent.  We had the escargot, beet salad, and vegetable turrine for starters. All delicious, all well seasoned. With the Complimentary fresh baguette, the escargot fish was left white and shiny.  Lobster roll and iron steak were amazing. I'd definitely come here again and again...And again!",

We ordered:  Afternoon Joe - basically a bourbon spiked coffee that was strong as hell.  Frog Legs Provencal - first time eating frog legs...everyone always said it tastes like chicken but to me its more like gator...a mix of chicken and fish...not the biggest fan of frog legs but the sauce was excellent with the bread  Andre's Burger - for the price of $7 you get an amazing good quality burger with fries...a bigger steal then the piggies that tried to steal jewelry from the Bellagio.  French Onion Soup - Not the best but it sure was one of the cleanest broth for a French Onion Soup I had...if that makes sense...  Lamb Burger - didn't try it..not a fan of lamb however my girl that ordered it said it was juicy but didn't quite like the taste...  Overall they have a very solid menu regardless of the time of day and with established quality to the name and for the price point you know that you are getting a excellent meal at an affordable price.",

Appetizers-excellent. Caesar salad with real anchovies and the seafood platter but both outstanding.   Beverages-great. Excellent cocktails and  interesting and reasonably priced wine list.  Entrees-disappointing. The burger and the salmon we're both a little overcooked. The muscles had sat too long under the heat lamp. The muscles were replaced but this time the sauce was like warm water.  We did enjoy our experience here. The appetizers and cocktails made it worthwhile, I just wish the staff were a little more professional.

    "text": "Went in for brunch on a Saturday afternoon after hearing great things about this place and was left very disappointed. The food was decent but service was horrible.   We were a group of five and wanted to start with some beignets which we ordered the same time as our oysters, sad to say that the beignets never came. The French Onion Soup was nice and flavorful unlike most of the rest of our meal. The lobster roll was bland and nothing on it popped or stood out as far as flavors. The quiche Loraine was cold, soggy and mucus like. I also ordered a side of the potato salad which when I asked the waiter was explained as a potato dish with eggs mixed with mayonnaise and mustard. When it actually came out it was the same as the breakfast potato dish that someone from our table received, sauteed finger potatoes with onions. I pointed out to the busser and waiter that this was not what I ordered and they then continued to convince me that what I got was actually their potato salad. I didn't want to send the food back or argue with them so I decided to give it a try and was unpleased with how much they lacked salt, but had an overpowering taste of black pepper. When we asked to get some of the food to go one of the ladies that worked there gave us attitude since we had to ask her to wrap it up again after she had left the dish on the table for 20 min after cleaning the table off before the desserts arrived. The desserts on the other hand were amazing. As a group we ordered the milk shake, creme brulee, the sundae and pot de creme. Mmmmm.... all of them were beautifully executed. I probably enjoyed the pudding dish the most. It was like a chocolate truffle pudding. I wouldn't mind giving the place another try but I hope I don't get the same staff.",

The food was delicious and our server could not have been better (thanks Nathaniel!), along with the other help.  I attribute this to the review in the LVRJ newspaper that mentioned the poor service.  What a turnaround!    As for the food, we had lunch - French onion soup (excellent), a chicken sandwich and a burger, with, of course, duck fat fries.  The chicken sandwich was declared to be delicious and my burger was one of the best I've had.  Perfectly cooked with great condiments.  The bread and butter are both wonderful.    Overall, we can highly recommend Andre's Bistro.",

    "text": "If I could give this place a minus star, I would. You should be ashamed of yourself by calling this place, a French restaurant. I have been to Paris, France and  let me tell you, the French food there is excellent as well as the service. I ordered the Golden Trout Amandine, and it looks really yucky to look at. I took a bite of the trout and it tasted like salmon. I sent the food back, it was so horrible. There for dinner all I had to eat was bread and butter, because I ordered the steak, and I had to send that back too. Such horrible food. At a least a free dessert would have been nice to rectify the situation, and to warrant a second chance to try this restaurant again. I paid $12 for the tiny Andre's Classic Souffle, it was good but not worth the price. I hope this restaurant closes soon. Chef Andre you created an epic failure.You failed to convince me to return to your restaurant, and a simple I'm sorry from the waitress does not do anything to rectify my anger and disappointment.",

The only thing positive I can say is there was a warm greeting when we walked in and our busser was attentive when it came to refilling our water.   That being said, the overall service was bummer. Our waiter took our order, ran over to tell us that if we wanted the souffle we had to put the order in RIGHT AWAY, and that was the last time we saw him.   Our cheese plate came out on a fly by with no explanation of what was on it. I had to flag someone down to ask what some of the accompaniments were. Then our entrees with the same drop off.   The ribeye I ordered looked a lot more like the \"flat iron\" they had on the menu and was cooked all the way through. (Ordered medium rare)... I've seen better steaks on IHOP commercials. My wife's ricotta gnocchi came out surrounded by a messy plate of inedible bitter greens and a mint \"paste.\"   If you're thinking \"why didn't you send it back\" I didn't see anyone again until our water glasses were empty and wasn't going to just sit there until someone noticed us.   I did wind up flagging down our busser again, this time to pay, after we sat there for another 10 minutes after finishing our meal.   Maybe it was an off night as I have heard good things about Andre's but if so, it was a James Harden level off night.",

Started out with a Calamari appetizer which was very good, though a relatively small portion. That doesn't very much concern us...if you want big portions go to Claim Jumpers.   There then seemed to be a delay and while waiting for our entrees we noticed that no one in the restaurant was being served...kinda weird, but ultimately our plates arrived. The Artisanal Housemade Sausages were very good and they brought mustard and pickles on the side.   Moules Frites consisted of very meaty mussels in a delicious sauce but 1) there were no tomatoes in the tomato concasse...we pointed it out and they brought them out from the kitchen, 2) the duck fat fries that came with were room temperature, 3) they provided no small fork for easier access to the mussels 4) they provided no plate or bowl for the mussel shells.   Andre's is not overly expensive but neither is it cheap so I expected a little more. But we'll certainly give them another shot since the food quality is high.",

    "text": "The first time I came here, it was ironically last year during restaurant week. I remember that they did not know about it initially until they asked someone in the kitchen and then brought the menus out. They were not well organized but they made up for it with good food. They were new at current location. That is why I gave them five stars at that time. Tonight, I was let down. To begin with, there were five people in my party and I specifically put on my open table reservation that it is for a birthday and the name of the person. I even called the restaurant personally one hour before and they confirmed that they had the information that this was for someone's birthday.  We get there on time and we are sat at a regular table. We are given regular menus. I see that the waiter is holding smaller menus, which did turn out to be restaurant week menus, but he did not give us those until I asked for them. This is the second year, during restaurant week, where they did not offer the restaurant week menu. Then, to make things worse, our waiter is absolutely clueless! First he tells us that he believes that a filet mignon is on the restaurant week menu that can replace the flat iron steak and then he tells me that there is a dorade type of fish on the menu. Neither is right. We order our food and the food is pretty good. We get to dessert, and nothing! No candle (not important), no decoration (not important), no happy birthday (important). Her dessert was as plain as ours.  Several times we had to signal the waiter to come over to fill water glasses as they were empty for quite a while. I also had to signal someone for the check. What's crazy is that the restaurant was not full... In fact it was less than half full! The food at this restaurant is delicious, but the service has a great deal left to be desired. I hope a manager reads this and takes this seriously because I have come to this restaurant over eight times in the last year and usually the service is OK or below par, and it has never been outstanding. I chose to come here instead of going to an incredible restaurant on the strip for convenience because we only live five minutes from this restaurant. I was really let down tonight and my friend's birthday was non existent! This restaurant needs to be careful because it may have great food but it needs to keep up good service. Once again, really let down tonight.",

We celebrated our wedding anniversary here for dinner tonight, after cancelling plans to go to another restaurant further away from the house, and I'm so glad we ended up here instead! The service was impeccable, the food was delicious (perfect medium rare filet!!), and the ambiance was everything we could have wanted for our celebratory dinner. Nathaniel was our server, and he made sure we had everything we needed throughout our entire meal. The manager on staff tonight was very attentive to all guests and looked like he had all of the staffs backs. We can't wait to come back!!! Thank you, Andres, for a wonderful dinner tonight! And many compliments to the chef!!!",

My wife and I started off sharing a Lyonnaise salad that was impressively large and delicious.  Our entrees were less successful with my wife ordering the Scottish salmon and I the moules frites.  The salmon was topped with some roasted bell peppers and included a mundane cauliflower sauce.  My mussels, though farm raised in PEI, had not been cooked long enough leaving several unopened and others on the raw side.  I forgot that our Groupon included 2 glasses of Champagne until I began to settle our bill so we gave those to an adjoining table.",

    "text": "Had date night here last night, wasn't super disappointed but also not really impressed. Our server Nate was really attentive but also allowed us to enjoy our meal without bombarding our table every 5 minutes. We sat further back in the restaurant which was nice because it was still light outside and there are a lot of windows in the front - being tucked back there was a darker and more intimate.  Started off with the charcuterie plate. And a couple glasses of the Sonoma Chard. I'm not joking the meat + cheese portion was soooo small. One roll of prosciutto, and two slices of the thinnest coppa I've ever seen, there was a nice amount of the duck pate (my personal fav) so that was nice. Cheese - blue cheese, taleggio (so yum but just not enough), and the other two were firmer cheeses' and clearly not memorable. There were more toppings (d. mustard, cornichons) then there was meat + cheese. So there's that.  For entrees we both choose the Cobb (salads aren't my usual choice but it was super hot outside and I wanted greens) comes with grilled chicken. I expected it to be warm and sliced chicken. But it was cold and in chunks, which makes me question its freshness. My bf subbed the chicken for steak, cooked to a perfect med-rare temp. Surprisingly the up-charge for the steak was only $6 (about 4oz filet)   I do really like the bar area. I'd return for drinks and different apps with girlfriends. But def pass on dinner next time.",

    "text": "A mainstay on the strip for over a decade at the Monte Carlo and now, hopefully, they'll be a mainstay in the southwest suburbs with their newly opened, more casual French bistro that took over the old DW Bistro space. The layout is pretty much unchanged, but the addition of dark wood accents and some modern lighting really make this space more intimate.   While there are some traditional French dishes on the menu, the food is anything but old and stuffy. The sauteed foie gras is a modern dish paired with nutella brioche and strawberries to create an unforgettable combination of savory and sweet. For a more traditional dish, the braised lamb shank was a flawless execution of tender, fall off the bone meat over orzo pasta bathing in a rich, tomato based sauce. Their risotto is outstanding -- great firm texture to the rice, covered in a savory sauce and parmesan. I loved the flavors, presentation, and execution. The charcuterie board was an excellent display of house cured meats large enough to share with a few friends.  Less impressive were the gnocchi dish and mussels. The former was full of summer vegetables and ate more like a salad. The latter entree had some huge mussels that were too chewy and gritty.  Don't forget to ask about their specials. The first night I dined there they featured a lobster thermidor. While expensive, it was a beautiful display of buttery crustacean.   I can never turn down dessert, and with a souffle on the menu I had to get it. They had both a grand marnier and a chocolate version. If you can't decide, like me, get the half and half. A light, fluffy souffle that showcased both flavors well. Another dessert, the dense, sweet chocolate gateau, was fantastic. Even though it was a relatively small slice it packed plenty of punch.  This is, without a doubt, a special place that's perfect for a date night or group gathering. Let's hope locals will fall in love with it and keep it around for years to come.  4.5 Stars",

Who doesn't love Rose' all day on Saturday and Sunday's.(Well maybe from open until 3ish)    They did a nice job renovating the former DW Bistro while still maintaining some of the charm. We love sitting at the bar when Tim's working, as he is so attentive and personable. The bar stools feel like a \"pillowy-cushion\" and you can charge your phone if you have a USB cord! Awesome when your phone is always on the dead side!  If a burger is your poison, this is the place to chow down on one. The bun paired with sauteed onions and butter lettuce melts in your mouth. If a salad is your thing, stop at the cobb.  The winner here for appetizer's is the escargot. The garlicky, herbal mixture was nothing short of amazing.  You'll want to order extra French bread to sop up the extra sauce because they give you plenty.    The downside is, they took the croissants off the menu for whatever reason known to man.  We hope they have an epiphany and put them back on.  Bon' Apetit, my sweets.",

The inside is a very nice casual and modern, great for a date too! Slightly dim lights and nice glassware and table set up. We got both the Andre's burger and the lamb burger. Both were seriously amazing! And for $8, the size was big and it even came with duck fat fries (which are a step up from normal fries)! I subbed my fries for a lobster Mac n' cheese which cost $6 more to sub it instead of fries. Super worth it! The size of the Mac n' cheese was twice the size I expected, it was an entire good sized boat of macaroni and you can really taste the lobster, they put more lobster than I expected in it! Try the grapefruit beer too, that was a delicious drink. I think we found our new burger spot! Will be back for sure! And Nate was our server and he was very knowledgeable about the food and he suggested more recommendations than I asked for! Great server! Also, sorry for the phone quality, I had to snapshot the photos from a video I took. You can see how big the lobster Mac n' cheese is and the sizes of the burgers!",

Tim was the bar keep at the time, his service was excellent and was the reason for my return actually. On my second go I met Cameron who is the other bar keep, and is a True craftsman of cocktails. I shared a few ingredients and he proceeded to make me one of the most balanced cocktails I've had from this request. The service from both of these guys is second to none, and the fact that they turn out some solid drinks is a bonus. If you visit venture out from your typical vodka soda and you should be pleased. The food is excellent, i have not had a bad meal here. If i had to pick my fav's so far i dig that signature burger with that marmalade, and the gnocchi is a solid dish as well. I will state my only small issue and i hope it gets addressed but there has been a lack of consistency. The fries are different on occasion, and I've had different buns on my hamburgers (like wonder buns). If your ironing out the kinks, just know you had it right form the start, don't change a thing.   If you live in the Southwest you are doing it wrong if you're still going to PT's to eat. Come down, give it a try....just save room for me at the bar.",

    "text": "Andre's is the place to be to celebrate your birthday with a large group!  They are very attentive to reservations and following up to the moment you walk in- they welcome you with a warm welcome!  It was perfect start to celebrating the evening. I started with a Cheese Cheese and Charcuterie Board Dinner & Pinot Grigio! So amazing, the only wish we had was crackers instead of bread. Then, we moved on to Escargots de Bourgogne for a different pace of taste which was melting into your mouth right when you take your first bite. After, my friends decided to surprise me with the One of Each dessert platter. I blew my candles with Saturday Sundae which was the hardest piece to share since it was so decadent and delicious I didn't want the taste to end!  My server Christian was a great server and as well as the others who helped with my party of 10! Thanks again Andre's! Will for sure be coming back and recommending.",

    "text": "Being a local of this area for many years and frequently dining at the last restaurant here, when Andre's popped up I was interested in checking it out.   My first time here was for happy hour-  Cheese Board-the jam served with it was not great and they did have pickles and mustard but I think it just needed more variety with it-maybe more jams or nuts. The cheese was just ok.   Frog Legs-my husband said he was not a fan  Andre's Burger-I really enjoyed this. I loved the fries too. When I asked for medium, they actually gave me medium. First time that has happened in forever.   Lyonnaise Salad-way too vinegary. I am not a fan of all frisee salad I have found out. It is too boring for me. The lardons were huge which some would appreciate but I felt it overwhelmed the light frisee.   Service was great. My first time here would not exactly bring me back, but I am curious about their main dishes.",

Having to trek down to the strip for a Brunch is annoying. This was a breath of fresh air.   We were seating in what seemed like overflow seating. It was where they may host catering events, etc. I am mentioning this because there were glass racks everywhere and this is where a kitchen door was. Not the most appetizing area to be seating but I can understand why they do it.   We started with mimosas and bloody Mary's. We did not get the \"bottomless\" option but they're available for a few of their drinks. We then ordered beignets. They were so yummy! Piping hot too.   We ordered eggs benny, croque madame, and chicken and waffles. They were all delicious! Their fries are fried in fuck fat...need I say more? One issue here; the fried chicken with the waffles was very spicy. There was no mention of this on the menu (that we can recall) and it would have been nice to know in advance. The person eating it is not one who enjoys spicy.   We will be back. Pricing was totally reasonable!",

I made reservations several days prior. We arrived right on time and were shown to a very small table for 2 when there were plenty of larger tables available. Women need room to put their purses, instead of settling for the floor! They no longer had a separate lunch menu. It's the same menu for dinner. If I want to pay $100.00 for 2 for lunch (I drank water, my friend had 1 beer), I will go to the Strip. I asked not to rush the second course, but was still eating my first course when the 2nd arrived. We had to ask for their French bread. The server said we didn't want any!!  We never did. No birthday acknowledgement. I won't return.",

We were told that without a reservation, we wouldn't be able to be seated until at least 8:15. We were flat out turned away. We felt as tho this was on purpose because I was in jeans and sneakers and my friend was in sweats. On yelp they are listed as casual, and there were even young kids seated inside.

I had the creamy potato truffle soup to start, followed by the trout almondine with haricot verts and ended with the creme brulee.  The soup was fantastic. Creamy with great texture and truffly without being too truffly. The  trout was perfectly cooked and very moist. The haricot verts were also well cooked with some crunch left in them. The custard of the creme brulee was silky smooth and the berries on top were very fresh. The only thing I would improve was the bruleed top could have been a bit thicker for some added crunch. The staff was very friendly and attentive from the host that greeted us to the bartender waited on us. The assisting staff that delivered our food and bussed our table was also friendly and helpful. We are looking forward to returning for Happy Hour or dinner.",

    "text": "Honestly, we had a terrible time at Andre's on Saturday night. It was packed, which is completely expected for a Saturday night, but the restaurant was totally understaffed. It was 20-30 minutes between each contact with our server. We were at our table for 30+ minutes before actually ordering our food and an hour before we got our appetizers.  We ordered the foie gras app and the meat was burnt to a crisp, completely inedible, and couldn't even be cut. The french onion soup was basically salty water. Our entrees were only a little better, definitely needing salt, but it took so long for the server to come over to us that we ended up asking the table next to us to borrow theirs. When we would ask a busser or food runner for something (salt, lemon, more water) they would leave and never come back. Our server was really nice and we actually felt bad for her. It was only her second weekend there and she was totally overwhelmed.   We finished eating and sat there for another 30 minutes, trying to flag SOMEONE down to bring us our check. The server brought the bill and we gave her our card, only to have her come back 10 minutes later to say that the register was having some sort of issue and our card couldn't be ran. She disappeared again before we could get a proper explanation...we didn't bring enough cash, soooo what would they like us to do? Again, we sat for minutes wondering what was going on. We finally flagged down the manager (who never showed up when we originally asked for her) and asked her what the deal was? We had $50 in cash and the bill was $59...could we use our card to pay or not? She didn't apologize, but told us \"...to just go.\"   I guess we got a few dollars off our bill, but what kind of manager responds like that?! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone and we will never go back. We couldn't decide which was worse, the service or the food. When all was said and done, we were there for two and a half hours and only spent about 30 minutes of that actually eating!! The rest of the time was spent praying for someone to come to our table. The worst!",

    "text": "While the rave reviews continue, I remain underwhelmed by my experience here. The service was a little rough, but they had opened only a few weeks prior. The food was only average.  I tried the escargot which were standard, but the baguette that came to the table before hand was wonderful and very nice to soak up the garlic herb butter with. The onion soup au gratin was unremarkable. The salmon entree was bland and could have used some help from a sprinkling of salt. Duck fat fries weren't anything special, but fries are always good. When asked if a shrimp cocktail was possible since they offer a raw bar, it took several trips back and forth to see if they could do so, but in the end they were able to accommodate the request and i appreciated it. It would be helpful to have a raw bar menu so that you could build a seafood platter by mixing and matching. The vegetable terrine, or pate as it might have been called, was one of my favorite things to arrive at the table.  When we sat down, I had asked about a bottle of champagne and recommendations. Little was known about whether or not they had a blanc de blanc or which tended to be more pinot noir heavy. Again, they had only opened for a few weeks, and so I don't blame them for this. I was however, given two different answers which didn't inspire confidence. We also had someone join the table about 30min after we sat down and it was like pulling teeth to get another glass of water, a glass for the champagne, and an order in. The service was a little slow, but to their credit they were very busy that night which is a great sign for business.  I've seen pictures of their beautiful souffles and that alone might be enough to draw me back!",

The Escargot is fabulous, and the Crispy Calamari is another appetizer I would highly recommend. The Chilled Seafood Platter was tasty, the oysters were delicious, the lobster, however, was a little tough and not one of my favorite parts of the platter. The Golden Trout Amandine was really really good. The fish was cooked perfectly! It was so light and fluffy and the sauce was a perfect compliment without overwhelming the flavor of the fish.

I had the daily special beef Bourgogne with mashed potato while my wife had the trout almandine.  Beef was very tasty and melt in mouth tender.

After not getting any response (not looking for any handouts just wanted them to fix the problem) and them still not addressing the issue I decide to post it for all to see, as I don't want anyone else to have the same issue we did: \"We LOVE Andre's (see our previous review), so it was easy for us to choose your restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. We were so excited for our dinner with you guys. We arrive there at 5pm Sunday so he could take advantage of your Happy Hour..couldn't wait for steak, lobster Mac & Cheese and desserts. So imagine our disappointment when we got there and you CLOSED!!! Neither Yelp or your own website reflect these new hours and changes to Happy Hour. Please update these sites as to not disappoint anyone else. We still love your restaurant but thanks to you our anniversary has been ruined as we were forced to make last minutes changes to our plans\"",

I went here with a group of people, and got to try several dishes.  Escargots- 3.5 stars.  French Onion Soup- 2 stars.  I'm not sure what cheese they used, but I swear it wasn't Guyere. Maybe mozzarella. It was waaaaay too soft. It lacked the slight bitterness that Guyere adds to the dish, so I was disappointed.   Seafood platter- 4 stars. Such a small platter for a great price. It's perfect for 1/2 person. Yes, not for 2 is my point.  My salad with the egg on top sounded great, but I wasn't diggin' it too much, since I didn't finish it.   My friends loved the baguette they served at the beginning, but I personally wasn't a huge fan.   I may be back to try several other dishes. It looks like their brunch is a lot more popular.",

The restaurant is chic, and tastefully decorated.  The service was really great. The waiter made sure our waters and cocktails/ drinks were filled. We ordered most of the items from the happy hour menu. Happy hour is from 3pm to 5.30pm. The menu is unique which I like. We had the Charcuterie Board, everything on it were really delicious. The escargot was really flavorful with  tons of garlic and butter. We also ordered Frog legs, although the batter was heavy, it was meaty. We ordered Andre's burger to take home. Don't forget to order the house cocktails, it was also delicious. The bill was about $87 and $104 with tips for a happy hour meal but it was worth it.   Overall, the food portion was not small and the quality was excellent and so was the service and experience. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I won't cross Andre's off my bookmarks list so that I remember to go back again - and again.  Loved this place!    We were seated right away, given menus and a paper bag with the best bread I've had since moving to Vegas - 12 or 13 years of drought wiped away with a single bite.  Dense bread, with a crisp crust, just the way I love but can't find here.  See?  - it CAN be done!  Fortified with my glass of good German Riesling, despite the \"no booze\" warning on the medicine bottle, we ordered a Roasted Golden and Red Beet salad to share.  The kitchen divided it for us, plating each one prettily, and it was soooo good.  It didn't specify greens on the menu, but I was thrilled to see them there.  Just the right amount of dressing was paramount, since I forgot to ask for it on the side.  Wonderful combination of flavors.  My husband ordered Andre's Burger, medium, and it was incredible.  The red onion marmalade was perfect and plentiful, two slices of tomato were actually deep red (an accomplishment in this era of tasteless pink tomatoes), and the bun was brioche-y and lightly toasted, crisp where it needed to be, and soft in the right places.  He had them hold the truffle mayo, but that burger wasn't lacking for anything.  The accompanying basket of fries were enough to feed four.  I went for something different:  Trout Amandine, swimming in a beurre noisette, along with green beans.  I would have loved a larger portion of the green beans, but it was a beautiful dish.  I guess I've become accustomed to spicier food, because I thought it was a tad bland, but I think it was exactly the way it was supposed to be, because I finished every morsel of that sucker, something I never do.  And I was grateful that it wasn't salty at all.   Our server, Lori (or Laurie?), was friendly and good, and the manager, Cheryl with a C, bade us a warm goodbye.    I'd love to try their Happy Hour, but having it only from 3:30 to 5:30 makes it unlikely.  So I guess it'll be dinner again next time, and I hope that'll be soon.",

    "text": "Really great French place for date night. Review as follows ~~  Service: 5/5 Our server Nicholas was amazing. Super friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and gave amazing recommendations for sauces, wine pairings, and dessert! Water cups never reached half empty, and they were super accommodating when I didn't like the cocktail I ordered. I can't over state how amazing the service is here.   Food: 4/5 Roasted Vegetable Terrain: 3.5/5 Personally, not my cup of tea. My boyfriend loved it, but I was pretty indifferent to it. I do like that they use quality ingredients, and the flavors complement the veggies rather than mask the taste. I didn't like the gelatinous texture, and I personally prefer richer foods. Recommend if you want something light and fresh.   Gnocchi with pea puree: 4/5 I thought the gnocchi was a liiil' dense, but I really enjoyed the pea puree and the flavors. Really yummy vegetarian option ~  Ribeye steak with green peppercorn sauce: 4/5 The steak was overcooked. My boyfriend asked for medium rare, and it came out medium well. What really saved the meal for him was the green peppercorn sauce our server recommended. He said it was so good he could've eaten it as a soup. Separately, the steak was a 3/5 and the sauce was a 5/5.   Mashed potatoes: 3.5/5 Mashed potatoes are always good, but they weren't anything special.  Chocolate and Vanilla Souffle: 4/5 When our meal came out, our server gave us a heads up that the souffle takes 20 minutes to make so we ordered before we ate. Five minutes after finishing, the souffle came out. It was fantastically fluffy and rich, with a good rise. Plus, both flavors and sauces were amazing.   Chocolate Pot de Creme with Vanilla Ice Cream: 4.5/5 Basically described to me as \"chocolate pudding on steroids.\" Super rich dark chocolate pudding, topped with whipped cream and a sugar madeline cookie. Definitely recommend getting the vanilla ice cream to balance out the bitterness and the richness of the dark chocolate.    Pricing: 4/5 I thought the prices were super reasonable. For one appetizer, two entrees, one side, two desserts, and two drinks, it came out to $120 before tip. The ingredients are quality, the taste is good, but I think the real steal here is the service.  Overall: 4/5 Overall, I totally recommend this place. Great place if you're craving French food, or you're looking for a cute place for date night ~",

    "text": "First time at this fun little bistro! One of my very good friends from San Diego was visiting and we decided to do brunch. Well, I knew just the place thanks to Yelp!  Easy to find and close to home. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly when we arrived. The hostess did ask us if we had a reservation and I could see why. The place was almost full and I was glad there was just two of us. Our server Bailey was really what made our experience a 5 Star! She was full of personality and then I found out she hails from Michigan which is where my hubby is from, so we hit it off. She was helpful with our selections. I would love to have her again as my server next time I eat here.  It happened to be National Waffle Day yesterday for those that were unaware, but I just wasn't in the Waffle mood. There were some awesome looking Waffle dishes listed on the menu to try though.  I selected the Quiche Lorraine and my friend decided on the Lobster roll sandwich. Our food arrived timely and everything was really tasty. The Lobster roll did not lack Lobster and we shared both plates so we had a chance to enjoy both entrees. The Quiche was hot and cooked just right with a spicy finish. I had a yummy mimosa and my friend had a pricey glass of Chardonnay which she really enjoyed. We decided to close out the meal with an order of beignets. Oh my! Just so melt in the mouthy were these lil gems! Thank goodness there were only three as we could have ate more.  We sat inside since there was no room outside so I would recommend making a reservation if you really want to sit outside. The great weather heading our way is a good reason to sit outside. The interior is beautifully decorated with a mixture of industrial, modern and old world. It has a very charming feel and the space is not too big. The bar area is small but cozy. I could easily see myself dropping by for a little happy hour.  Honestly, I can't wait to return for dinner!",

    "text": "We don't normally celebrate Valentines Day but I've been wanting to try the newly opened Andre's so hubby surprised me by making reservations.   We were seated right away even though we got there 15 minutes early, a plus in my book. The place is minimally decorated which gives off a more sophisticated look. Even though the tables are spaced closer than I would've wanted, it didn't deter my excitement in finally trying this place.   Along with the regular menu, a prix fixe menu was offered for the night. I perused what it had to offer and since I'm not really a big fan of oysters we decided on doing ala carte instead.   We started with the bread. Conscious enough not to fill up on it, and making sure we had room for dessert because after all that was the main reason I wanted to try Andre's lol. We were undecided if appetizers should be ordered but ultimately gave in. Calamari was lightly crisp and served with a sweet Thai Chili sauce. For our entrees Hubby opted for the 10 oz flat iron steak with bearnaise sauce as recommended by our server, with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Honestly that sauce was not even necessary. That steak was perfection! Tender and flavorful, mouthwatering. I had my eyes set on the Roasted Chicken breast with mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions and fingerling potatoes. Moist with crispy skin, deliciousness in every bite.   Make sure you let your server know ahead of time if you're planning to get souffle for dessert, it takes about 25 minutes to make it. Lemme tell you, it's worth waiting for and worth all the calories! It was lusciously gratifying.   I can't wait to return and try their brunch options. Also looking forward to trying the escargot and maybe the frog legs?!?! Best part is you get all this at a fraction of the strip prices. Delicieux, bon appetit!",

    "text": "\"Go to the people and places that set a spark in your soul.\"  Andre's Bistro & Bar is the perfect neighborhood French Bistro!  The Monte Carlo lost out when they opted to move on from Andre's, but fortunately for residents on the southwest side of town, Chef Rochart and his team decided to reinvent themselves in a familiar bistro style concept the neighborhood should adore.    Andre's Bistro & Bar doesn't bring with it all the sophistication of their former establishment, but they do bring absolutely incredible food and excellent service. The setting and ambiance are ideal for their new Summerlin hood--elevating what the former DW Bistro had to offer, while bringing along a few remnants from their previous incarnation. I really enjoyed dinning in this space. It has a warm, inviting felling, and there was a great energy throughout the restaurant the evening that we came.  The food doesn't disappoint. My love and I started with the escargot and then shared the Mushroom Risotto and the Lamb Shank, before finishing our meal off with the Grand Marnier Souffle. We were dinning with our best friends and took the opportunity presented to try the Roasted Beet Salad as well. The menu features classic and refined French cuisine as well as a few contemporary items. The wine list nice and features some quality new world wines as well as several French wines.  Andre's Bistro & Bar is nice enough to take a date to, but it is really is an excellent choice for a double date, a small group of friends, or a business lunch.",

To wash it all down, I had the blackberry rickey, which I loved. We really like this place and it's close to home so that's a bonus.

    "text": "For quite some time, my gut had been starving for a nearby neighborhood French dinner spot....and now that ludicrously; shallow-assed prayer has been answered!  Andre's move from Monte Carlo to southwest Vegas may be a loss for tourists, but a huge win for locals.    I loved the fasual (fancy/casual) setting as well.    Finding it difficult to commit to any appetizer, since they all looked so damn good, we chose 3 (Sorry, escargot.  Next time!).  The Lyonnaise Salad was a great start.  Busting the poached egg all over the frisee and smoked lardons provided us with our own little private #yolkporn show.  Savoring those final fork stabs of cured pork fat had me yearning for another order as soon we met the face of the plate.    Seared Foie Gras: Baybeee, this is what I came for!  So enamored was I with this dish at the Strip location; this was an absolute must-order.   $10 less and a bit smaller in portion still delivered the mouth orgasm I sought.  The apple strudel accompaniment was new to me and took things up a notch (my belt included).  Not accounting for how fantastic the two complimentary warm baguettes with butter would be, there were concerns about not making the finish line, which was the Grand Marnier souffle that had to pre-ordered, so we split the special of the night.  Their Coq Au Vin was rich and satisfying; filled with chicken, mushrooms, and lardons (yes, more!), it was a wonderful segue to dessert.    I am so down for repeat visits.  Whether it's lunch, weekend brunch, frog legs at happy hour or just a couple of cocktails.  Can't wait!",

I think they only had one waiter that evening but it wasn't really that busy either - about 6 tables. Aside from taking our orders they did not check in after the food came out. I was awaiting the bread and butter but it never came until I asked the runner if he wouldn't mind bringing it out still since we didn't get any. They came to collect our plates 15 minutes after we finished. They did have a kids menu but again the flavor was not that great.   We ordered:  Lobster Roll - lobster is shredded more like a lobster salad in a roll  Wagyu steak and mashed potatoes - mashed potatoes were meh, the steak was the best item that evening but nothing out of this world  Kids mac and cheese Kids sliders  I would have liked to try a dessert but just wasn't feeling it after the experience. They gave us a coupon for a free dessert next time w/entree but I don't really see us returning.",

The French onion soup was slightly bland but at the bottom you notice the bigger herbs and the taste comes out wonderfully. The risotto was great with so much mushrooms and you can tell it's made fresh. The price point is slightly high for the amount but I would still return. If they lowered the prices a few dollars I could see myself adding this to our normal rotation of rest  Edit to add.   I have been ordering andres a few times a week through postmates for a while now. The dinner time everything has been spectacular. There new risotto is even better then the old one. But I had a craving for it in the afternoon and it was like a totally different experience. No consistency between the chefs. The soup they put the bread inside for a to go order so it was like eating soggy bread instead of liquid and the risotto was inedible it was so creamy. More then 2 bites was overwhelming it was so much fat and cream. I will still order it at nights but would hope a restaurant as nice as Andres could have some consistency between lunch and dinner staff",

French onion soup was one of the best i've had in a long time and they had a really good Croque monsieur.  Second time around the soup didn't hold up to my initial expectations, and as well they no longer offered my Croque monsieur sandwich. We had the mussels and fries - the sauce was so bland we asked if they could do something about it. I almost never do this. I felt a little embarrassed to call out the chef- no cook ever wants to be told their food is bland. They did attempt to fix it and give the sauce more flavor and body but it was doomed from the beginning.  Overall decent French food, but a little on the pricey side for the food quality and flavors. 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for Andre's, especially with many many people telling me how good it was and how it was worth trying. Well little and behold our experience was FUCKING TERRIBLE! I made reservations through OpenTable which was the best part of my experience. It was quick and efficient completely the opposite experience when we arrived at Andre's. I made reservations for 7 plus 1 child at 6:00 PM for Mother's Day dinner. We arrived a few minutes prior to 6:00 and the table was just about ready. We were seated efficiently and this was the best part of our experience.   Upon being seated, I don't even remember our server introducing himself. We sat down without any menus on the table it took probably 10 minutes before menus were brought to the table. We ordered appetizers as we waited for the rest of our party and our server mentioned he'd drop some bread off at the table as we waited. As the remainder of our party arrived, they had to ask for waters and asked for bread since we had been waiting for 15 minutes already. As we ordered our main courses, TWO of the options I wanted weren't available, I WISH our server had mentioned that certain dishes weren't available anymore. IF our server had told us dishes were unavailable FROM THE START our party could've had our eyes set on items that were available. I'M DISAPPOINTED ANDRE'S! I wanted a lobster roll but you ran out, I wanted the lyonnaise salad with duck confit BUT you ran out as well. It's common courtesy to let your guests know upon seating that certain items were not available anymore.   Moving forward, once our appetizers arrived, we noticed bread hadn't been dropped at the table yet and two water glasses hadn't been filled either. We asked once more for bread and water and they said they be right back. So as we waited for the water and bread we dived into our apps. By the time we finished our apps bread hadn't been served yet and water glasses weren't filled. I was trying to stay positive about our experience but I have to admit this was FUCKING TERRIBLE!   Finally receiving bread after 30 minutes and all our apps were finished, the server brought 1 roll to serve 8 people so yet again we had to ask for another roll. We waited another 15 or so minutes for our main course items to come out. As soon as they arrived many more issues arose. All dishes were served EXCEPT the Cobb salad, WHICH admittedly is easier to make than cooking a steak to perfection. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!? Then as one of the steaks were brought out and ORDERED as MEDIUM it was cooked to WELL DONE! And the reason / excuse for the execution was \"it was left under the heat lamp too long\" YOU'RE KIDDING ME RIGHT?! It's one thing to make up a reason to a guest who doesn't know much about the restaurant industry, but for me the excuse is bullshit. What kind of heat lamps are you using?!   After approaching the manager of the situation, he said he'd comped some desserts but at this point why would we want anything when everything went wrong. I'm livid about this experience. On a special occasioned day like Mother's Day I would like to think that management would have been better prepared for large parties by staffing appropriately. But unfortunately, we were given pitiful excuses and terrible service.",

When looking for what another diner called \"fasual\" or fancy casual French/American fusion dining, look no further than Andre. Celebrity chef and AAA 4 Diamond honored Andre Rochat has taken over the old DW space and opened the newest French restaurant in SW Las Vegas. The ambiance is upscale but casual and very chic. I love everything about this place from the dim pendant lights to the rooster bottles on the shelves to the real silver tea kettles. This place knows how to serve up delicious French fare and you don't have to break the bank enjoying it! We enjoyed the escargot for our starter.  The garlic herb butter was absolutely to die for and is perfect for dipping your crusty and warm baguette. For our entrees we had the Braised Lamb Shank and Orzo and Burger with Truffle mayonnaise.  Both were delicious but the lamb shank was fall of the bone goodness! For Dessert was the delicious Creme Brullee topped with fresh fruit and caramelized sugar. Everything was on point. I have found my favorite new restaurant in town!!",

It's a Bistro, so the portions are smaller, and you order a la carte.  I had the fillet and then added a green peppercorn sauce.  I also had the green beans with almonds.  I thought the green beans were better than the fillet.  The fillet was small - 6 oz, but I didn't really want any more than that.  I had it medium rare, but I would have preferred a little more sear on the outside.  It had a piece of gristle, or silver skin running through, but it was still good.  I also had the Caesar salad, which over dressed, but the flavor was good.  So why the 4 stars?  The service was really good, and the vibe was friendly.  If I lived in the area I would go there all the time.  Andre's has a good bar set up, so dropping in and sitting at the bar would be an option.  The beer selection is not very big, but well thought out.  I'm not sure I would make the trip from the strip (which I did), but like I said, if I lived in the area, I would be there all the time.",

The service was impeccable, the quality of the meal was excellent, and the price was completely reasonable. Having dined at the Monte Carlo location several times previously, I had very high expectations for this new neighborhood gem. It definitely did not disappoint. My only concern was that there were a lot of small children, and this made the overall noise level high.  Would love to return to this location for dinner, and hopefully enjoy an intimate and romantic meal. PS, the wine by the glass selection is absolutely amazing.",

Ceasar salad was overdressed and warm. The calamari was overcooked and chewy. Steak and frites were cool not warm and just bland. The salmon was good flavor and temp but the sides a throw away. I poked fun at the dated plating style but that wasn't really bad. The chocolate souffle was good texture but tasteless. The service asked how the entree was before either of us took a bite then only returned to clear. I debated a 3 rating but when you pay over $50 each for a dinner, I think it should be good- and this wasn't. Go follow DW to their new location at the Grammercy for flavor.",

    "text": "I will start by saying SOME of the food was tasty however, service was incredibly slow. We were dining with kids and every other restaurant makes sure to at least try and have kids food out first however, the kids waited just as extremely long to get their food as everyone else. Our server asked if we were going to wait to have our food come out so we could continue to enjoy the appetizer we ordered so we he kids wouldn't starve and when I replied that we would like the food, he stated it would be right out ...20 mins later, still no food. It is a shame because there was definite potential here however, the staff seemed confused and were not very efficient. There was no effort to apologize for the long wait times or to even offer anything for the kids who were quite audibly saying \"we are starving\". Once the food finally did come out, it came out one separated dish at a time with the kids food last. Though our wait was over, sadly our disappointment did not end there.   The food:  French toast: brought out cold. When we sent it back, they microwaved it then walked around confused unsure of which table it went to taking it first to a different table (they sat it down in front of a different person) before picking it back up, going back to the kitchen to figure out where to take it. Once three staff discussed the conundrum, they finally brought the nuked, rubbery, dry French toast back over to our table.  Veggie quiche with side salad: they should change this to side lettuce. A plate full of mixed greens with scarce dressing. The quiche was lukewarm but had a good flavor.  Kids mac and cheese: this was an adult dish that was put on a kids menu. Most kids don't like 5 different kinds of gourmet cheeses and as a result this dish was a fail. A bubbly pile of cheese with macaroni buried inside was not a hit with the kids.  The beignets, French onion soup, and charcuterie plate were very good.   Overall, extremely long wait for food, one person in our party got nothing, and  we had to take the kids to lunch after lunch. We even had a delay getting our check and had to enlist the assistance of another server since ours was dealing with yet another complaint and computer confusion. There is potential if they figure out their servers but I won't be back any time soon.   Note: there was also a circulating gentleman with a beard who appeared to be a manager but I wouldn't know since he made no effort to check on anyone even when they were visible distressed.",

It's a hard balance to pull off but he was perfect.  We had the lobster roll, it's got crab meat mixed in but still excellent, served on a perfectly buttered and toasted brioche spilt top bun; lamb burger, very Greek and authentic flavors; banana foster pancakes, they adjusted for our son and subbed in maple syrup, excellent with a sour dough tang; duck fat garlic fries, crispy outside, tender inside and finished them all.  Chocolate souffle was amazing and perfectly sized.  It was on the smaller side but perfectly intense and chocolatey.  The French onion soup was a fail.  It was way too vinegary.  Very strange for them to overdo the vinegar but I'll chalk it up to a fluke.  We'll be back for another fabulous meal soon.",

As a visitor to the desert annually, we tend to venture off strip to privateer establishments to support local business  Andre's, a bit of hike from the Strip, did not disappoint  Our table of six started with charcuterie and cheese boards and ended with a souffle, creme brulee and a lemon tart  Main brunch items included were lobster roll and fries, chicken and waffles, veggie quiche, cobb salad, chicken caesar salad and spinach omelette  The weakest dish of the bunch was the chicken and waffles imo....the waffle did not hold up well to the gravy slathered on and ended up being soft and mushy  Overall, excellent attention to detail and execution   We could have easily paid double for similar fare from Bardot Brasserie  If you have wheels, Andre's is well worth the trip",

As for the food and service, everything was delicious.  I had the Mixed Green Salad and a 6oz. Filet.  Both were prepared perfectly!  The steak was cooked medium, like I asked.

I ordered the French onion soup as a starter and it was bad. The cheese part was good but past that, the rest of the soup was too salty and it had some very harsh herbs that made it taste bitter. The waffles were not my favorite, the were very very very hard. Every bite made me feel like I was biting into cardboard. The pieces were so hard to chew and the syrup slipped right off of them because there was nothing to absorb the liquid due to the firmness of the waffle. The service was average, its hard to judge service on a larger party especially because some people in our party were late so the server had to keep coming back and wasn't sure how long to wait to come back each time to see if we were ready yet. Not her fault, so can't really speak on how the regular service is. Probably wouldn't come back due to the fact that the food just wasn't impressive at all. Wouldn't definitely recommend you skip this place when southwest has sooo many other brunch places that are incredible.",

    "text": "It seems that amazing Las Vegas has more talented chefs per capita than any other destination in the world. And the talent isn't confined to the Strip or even to the city itself. I've found outstanding dining  in every suburban nook and cranny and the prime example of this is Andre's Bistro in Spring Valley.   Andre's is in a non-descript shopping center on the edge of Spring Valley, near the Wet and Wild water park, and is a bit of a car drive for many people living in the Vegas valley as well as for travelers staying in Strip-accessible lodgings. It's unpretentiously chic, with the ambience of a classic French bistro but, in keeping with the bistro tradition, the food is the True shining star of Andre's.   Andre Rochat is a bit of a Vegas culinary icon. He ran Andre's, his Michelin star namesake restaurant at the Monte Carlo, until it closed in 2016. Andre's Bistro, run by Rochat's former employees in partnership with him, is the incarnation of Andre's in name and spirit. It's not as fancy or as expensive as the Andre's at Monte Carlo was - I think of it as the acoustic version - all of the quality stripped down to the essential of providing great food.  I started the night with an OG Mai Tai, prepared the way I like it; tart, not too sweet, and as smooth as liquid silk. I loved the maraschino cherry garnish, they use the real kind, not the radioactive fluorescent ones. It was the best mai tai I've ever had, the night was off to a good start.   The menu is classic French, not Cal-French, so they don't do anything odd or extravagant here. I was pleased to see Dover Sole on the menu ($55, that's a rare find). I started with the Spring Risotto ($22, $15 for happy hour) made with ramps,  brussel sprouts, and goat cheese. It's served al dente (as stated on the menu) and, while I wasn't used to the crunch in the rice, it wasn't unpleasant. The risotto itself was hearty and vibrant, imbued with the earthiness of the ramps and brussel sprouts. I loved the burst of sweetness the tomatoes provided. Overall, it was a well-rounded dish, surprisingly, crunchy rice and all.   Next I moved on to the Moules Frites ($15 for happy hour), made with PEI mussels, garlic, parsley, saffron, and cream. It is served with a side of duck fat fries that were perfectly flavorful and crisp. The mussels theselves were fresh and clean tasting and greatly enhanced by a delicious broth that I couldn't stop sopping up with my bread. My dining companion got the Potato Gnochhi and it was the lightest, fluffiest gnocchi I've ever had. All the dishes were delicious, but I'd say the gnocchi was the big winner of the night.   Andre's also has a full stocked bar and a decent wine list with French labels at reasonable prices. In summary, the restaurant is a local gem. The values during happy hour are insane and include Saturdays from 3pm - 6pm. It's destination dining for both visitors and locals looking for high-end,  Strip quality food in a comfortably non-bougey setting. Andre's Bistro has happily earned a place in my regular rotation, especially during happy hours.",

He gave small joking remarks when I said I will just have water for drinks and when I paid for the meal at the end of the meal, he tossed the check with my $71 change attached on the table as he walked by and kept walking. Jose the waiter made us feel unwanted at Andre's Bistro.  My husband ordered iron steak medium well, It was well done.  I ordered eggs Benedict and French toast with WATER.  We always give 20% tip but today was only 10% thanks to our waiters attitude throwing my money on the table without a word.  Now I feel that was too much.  We definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "Sometimes you want a really good meal, without having to travel to the Strip. Thank goodness for off-Strip restaurants like Andre's Bistro & Bar.  I came here with my husband for a brunch date. The setting was very intimate. We had the option of dining al fresco style or inside. Although the weather was perfect, we asked for a table towards the back of the restaurant for more privacy.  Andre's Bistro has a wonderful staff that caters to a sophisticated local crowd.   The restaurant had New Orleans style jazz piped in, so I though it was only fitting to order the beignets. It made me feel as though I'd been transported to the Big Easy. Our server suggested the spinach omelette, which had tomatoes, goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms, plus breakfast potatoes. My husband opted for the salmon burger with sweet potato fries. Both entrees had a ton of flavor!!For dessert, we shared the Saturday Sundae and the chocolate souffle. The souffle took about 20 minutes, but was totally worth it. The sundae was made with homemade vanilla ice cream, brownies, hot fudge, caramel sauce and hazelnuts. It sort of reminded me of a praline sundae. Overall, this was the perfect meal!",

We weren't super hungry so I had escargot with duck fat fries and my wife had the lobster role with sweet potato fries.  Everything was very good. The duck fat fries were bomb!

    "text": "Pretty decent but not all that. We won't be back.   I took my my girlfriend on a date and wanted it to be a French restaurant. I liked the atmosphere, it was pretty cute and cozy, I liked ambience of the place - great music, perfect loudness (not too quite but can comfortably talk).  Service - 4 stars. It was good but just not fast enough. Everybody took their time. Our server and busboy were very friendly though.  Food - it was okay. Not bad but in my opinion it wasn't great. I don't have any desire to come back  We ordered: * French onion soups - barely any cheese crust. It tasted pretty decent but there was zero richness to it. I finished it. My girlfriend didn't eat the soup, said it was very plain for her taste. She prefers a richer taste. If you ever had a French onion soup, then you know what I'm talking about.  * their Sunday special - duck (can't remember full name of the dish). Its supposed to be served with foie Gras, waffle, and orange glaze. Since I ordered the dish on a Saturday, they didn't have waffles. They replaced it with mashed potatoes (upon my request). I liked the dish but I most certainly didnt think it was worth $35. A few tiny slices of duck (i was hoping it would have crispy skin but alas!), 3 tiny pieces of foie gras, some mashed potatoes and spinach (spinach was a good touch). I was pleasantly surprised with orange glaze, it was made with duck broth, was thick and flavorful, and tasted delicious. Like I said, I liked the dish but it was NOT worth $35. * my girlfriend ordered caeser salad and said it was pretty plain. She kept adding salt and pepper. Said like something was missing. She finished the salad but said that it was nothing special and she wouldn't order it again.   Drinks: full bar. I ordered bloody Mary and was not happy. It was super bitter and strong, barely had any spice and flavor. My girlfriend ordered beer, it was fine.   So I liked the place, it was great for a date in terms of service, ambience, & atmosphere. They also have a full bar which was great. However, both my gf and are didn't find food good enough to ever want to come back, so we'll be looking for other French restaurants.",

The layout is almost identical yet the ambience is a markedly improved with richer, deeper tones....French Bistro tones, if you will.  While the dinner experience is rather sexy and romantic, lunch time is upbeat and casual. I have been in multiple times for both lunch and dinner. On my latest visit, my girlfriend and I came in for lunch and ordered the Lobster Roll and Cobb Salad. The Lobster Roll was well seasoned, with chunks of Lobster wrapped up with warm, crispy bread.  It came with garlic French fires...I wish I would have asked to substitute with a salad, as I'm not much of a fry eater. The Cobb Salad showed up with bountiful amounts of bacon and chicken. My friend loved her salad very much. Our waiter brought us a warm baguette and butter as we finished our meals...almost felt like an after thought.  All the dishes I've had over 4 times visits has been nothing but delicious. I would like to come on a Wednesday for their mid-week brunch between 10am to 3:30pm.  I am both proud and grateful that Vegas locals have chef Rochart and his team off the strip and in this neighborhood.   -2017 review #52-",

I loved the horseradish sauce it paired perfectly. It had that little bit of kick that helped with just an all meat sandwich. Instead of au jus it's served with French onion soup minus the cheese. The dip was really flavorful but it didn't even need it. I only dipped every other bite if that. It also served with a basket of homemade chips. The bf ordered the lobster roll which has a mix of blue crab in it. It didn't have too much mayo which is good and it didn't have pieces of veggies which is also good. It was citrusy and meaty. It was served in a buttered what looked like Texas toast. They have Stella on tap.  One last thing service was awesome. Got there as soon as they opened and our server was very welcoming and helpful with answering our questions.",

The phone, even though she called after 3pm, always went to an answering machine. She left multiple messages with no return phone call. Finally, I was able to reach someone via Facebook. We made our reservation for today for afternoon tea. We expected, based off the reviews, that it was going to be good. Wow were we wrong! First off they set us at a table that only fit 4 people, there were 5 of us, so everyone was bumping elbows. We sat there for awhile before finally someone came by and asked if we wanted drinks from the bar. Our waiter,Christian, finally showed up with a box to pick our tea. Everyone chose one and my 7yr old was offered hot chocolate, which made her happy. Christian came by with warm bread and butter for our table but no water for our tea bags. We waited about another 10-15 mins for hot water. He brought the water in silver tea kettles that were tarnished, now I'm not sure if they were meant to be like that or now but to me it was not to my liking. I waited for a tea cup for my mom and myself and instead of bringing me a tea cup, Christian brings me a glass of ice water!! What do you want me to do with that? Finally he brought one for me but not my mom. I finally had enough and went and grabbed one off the table behind us. They offered two different soup options, we all chose the French onion. This is one thing I can't complain too much about except I wished it had more cheese. It was yummy!!  The chef came by with our trays of scones and sandwiches but we had to remind her to bring the cream, curd, and preserves. The sandwiches were very good, I didn't like the salmon was warm and very chewy but the chicken salad and egg salad were really good! We constantly had to ask for hot water and I asked for ice water but he forgot more then once.   The desserts came and in my opinion were pathetic and not very good for a tea service. The ladies at the table next to us received a little chocolate cake like dessert while we got cookies and raspberry meringue cookies... none of which were good.   The service was terrible, the food wasn't that great, and the atmosphere wasn't good either. For what we spent on the tea I expected way more then what we got!",

    "text": "We arrived right on time for our 6:00 reservation and were quickly seated. Water and bread arrived while we looked over the menu. I think we got different bread than Sheila G did because it was just okay. And then we waited and waited with no one coming over. We finally flagged someone down and asked if anyone was working our table. He said \"I can take your order\". Ok then.   We started off with some french wine and the french onion soup. For the entrees we ordered the trout almandine and the Ribeye steak. They ask you to order the souffle in advance which we did. A short time later another server came over and apologized telling us she had no idea she had our table. It is a pretty small restaurant with only a couple servers but I let it go as an honest mistake.   Being at a french bistro with a french chef we had high hopes for the onion soup. Unfortunately it was a let down. Where's all the cheese?? It was baked on the outside of the bowl instead of inside with the onions and broth. There was some on the bread as well but I like a lot of cheese IN the soup. The entrees came out and the trout was presented very nicely with potatoes and green beans. I do agree with Sheila G that it just needed some more flavor. It was good, but not great. The green beans were cooked perfectly crisp. The ribeye was also good, cooked as ordered and tender.   Finally the souffle came out and looked amazing. Surprisingly, even with the chocolate sauce I thought it wasn't sweet enough. The actual souffle was lacking chocolate flavor, but it was cooked perfectly.   Andre's was a strong 3 stars for me, but I wouldn't be in any rush to return. Nothing stood out as amazing or outstanding. It was also very warm inside which I don't like when I am eating.",

    "text": "Andre's is a welcome addition to the Vegas dining scene! The food quality coupled with reasonable prices prove that \"you don't need a silver fork to eat good food,\" - a quote  by Paul Prudhomme featured on their exterior that encapsulates what Andre's has to offer.   HAPPY HOUR: My first visit for HH was stellar. Bar seating, TV tuned to a Spurs game, attentive but unobtrusive service, and incredible food. The frog legs ($8) were a pleasant start to the meal but Andre's burger (a $7 steal!) stole the show, with gooey gruyere, red onion marmalade, and truffle mayo coming together to combine the flavors of a burger with French onion soup. The sturdy pretzel roll held up well, too.  It was marvelous and that burger was on my mind for days. Days!   BRUNCH: Came with a group and tried several dishes but was less impressed. Standouts were the escargots (so garlicky, request extra bread!), Artisanal Sausage Platter (loved the lamb!), the crispy Liege-style Belgian waffles, classic French Onion soup, duck fat fries, and the desserts (order the souffle ahead of time). Unfortunately, several dishes were marred by cooking errors. The Chicken and Waffles featured a great gravy but limp waffles and soggy chicken, while Andre's Classic Benedict was skimpy on the ham and unremarkable other than the side of crispy potatoes. Most of the items on a friend's charcuterie board went unfinished while a burger was received at the wrong temperature. Our server wasn't around much and refills had to be requested but he was pleasant enough. Perhaps they were understaffed.   \"First we eat, then we do everything else,\" (MFK Fisher)- The dishes I liked I really liked and would return for, while I remain hopeful that a future dinner visit will fare better than brunch in terms of execution and satisfaction.   TIP: Happy Hour is 3:30-5:30, daily. It's the only time the Bistro Hot Dog is available; it's made in-house and regularly sells out. I've yet to have it but hear it's worth the wait.",

AND THIS PLACE DID NOT DISAPPOINT! The venue was cute, the service was attentive, the food was flavorful and we definitely got our day fade in with their bottomless mimosas! *hiccup*  They offer bottomless \"all-you-can-drink\" brunch with: - 25$ MIMOSAS - 22$ ROSE - 20$ HOMEMADE PUNCH  In terms of eats, my eye went straight for:  - LOBSTER ROLL ($18.00): Maine lobster, fine herbs on a buttery toasted bread roll. Comes with your choice of duck fat fries or a green salad. (I went with the salad, but ended up ordering a side of the fries when I sampled my friends -- which was $8, ouch!) - CHICKEN & WAFFLES ($16.00): Buttermilk fried chicken, corn bread waffles with a side of country gravy.   Would we come back? Definitely! :)  PRO TIP: They also have a happy hour menu from 3:30-5:30!",

    "text": "I was expecting more from my meal, especially given early rave reviews, but brunch fell flat.  Andre's Bistro and Bar is a fairly new location in Southwest Las Vegas carrying on the French cuisine of a local institution that used to be on the Strip for a time, and reportedly started out downtown a few decades ago. I was invited to brunch with several Yelp friends and leapt at the chance to try out what really should have been a better meal.  Drip Coffee ($3): good coffee, not that much bitterness, enjoyed it just fine as a black unsweetened coffee as I am wont to do these days, but I had to ask for refills twice before getting more coffee.  Bread with butter (complimentary): a very promising start, with an exceptional sliced baguette and a puck of creamy butter. It was confusing that only part of the table received this offering at the start, while the rest of us had to bide our time until around the arrivals of the appetizers/sides, but it was well worth the wait.  Duck Fat Fries (unsure of side dish price, was grazing on a friend's): the texture was reasonable good, but you'll definitely taste duck fat in every bite. Garlic was also plentiful. Ketchup was standard and came in a relatively small amount; fortunately, it wasn't necessary  Escargots de Bourgogne ($12): six snails served in those ceramic circular plates with indentations. Very good flavors from the herbs and garlic butter and not too chewy. The extra sauce complemented the complimentary baguette quite well too. Despite the cost, I'd order it again.  Andres Classic Benedict ($14): I enjoyed this in the moment, but it really feels like a small portion compared to similarly priced eggs Benedict at similar local spots. The Benedict was tasty and the yolk was runny, but the English muffin was unremarkable and the ham was especially sparse considering how thinly it was sliced. I had to do some excessive manipulation to get ham onto every quarter portion of the muffin. The potatoes were quite awesome, but a side dish does not a great entree make (and the potato portion was also small compared to something like Kitchen Table).  Chicken and Waffles ($16 on menu, but $14 on receipt): flavors were mostly right, although I just couldn't figure out how the (delicious, by the way) Southern-style gravy was supposed to be compatible with the syrup. The main issue is that the dish fell flat on textures. The fried chicken batter had the feel of flour, which shouldn't happen at all even if it's made of flour. The chicken itself was oddly too tender - not mushy, but it just didn't have the heft of being meat. The waffles - love the cornbread composition, by the way - could've been a little more crisp.  Chocolate Pot De Creme ($8): pretty good dessert. Smooth throughout, in both the chocolate and the cream topping. Didn't fall into the trap of tasting like boxed chocolate pudding, which was an issue at another local restaurant but the chocolate could be richer and/or darker. The vanilla \"cookie\" garnish was a bit ephemeral, but fun, and the mint garnish was nice but overpowering if actually eaten.  Grand Marnier Souffle ($12): great dessert overall. Fluffy, lemony, tableside presentation including a hole poked into the top and cream poured into that indentation. Pricey, but likely worth it if you're a fan of the dessert.  Small aforementioned issues aside, service was reasonable. There was a 18% auto-gratuity for our larger group. The receipt has an offer for 10% off lunch (Mon-Fri 11:30am-3:30pm) for a group of up to 6. Decor was welcoming enough, and televisions presumably can be tuned to major sporting competitions, although I wouldn't call ESPN's coverage of college softball that much of a must-see event.  Whether it was flaws in execution (such as the decidedly non-bleu cooking temperature of my tablemate's burger) or overarching recipe issues, my particular meal at Andre's Bistro and Bar did not meet my high expectations. Thus, I can't say that \"I'm a fan,\" although I'd rate my experience 3.5 stars if that were possible on Yelp. That said, I'll keep the place in mind for a revisit because of the praise I've heard and read for other menu items.",

Contemporary french in our neighborhood? We knew we had to try!  We were not disappointed.  Cute, trendy ambiance. Intimate but casual at the same time. GREAT drinks (french 75s served in coupes are our faaaave), and food was reasonably priced. We had the oysters, french onion soup, lobster roll, and some sausage dish (my husband).

Andre's salmon Benedict. Croque madame. Quiche Lorraine. Vegetable quiche. Chicen and waffles. Foie gras. Lobster roll with fries. Lobster roll with salad. Flatiron steak frites. Lemon tart. Sunday sundae. Root beer float. Walnut cake. Creme brulee.  There wasn't one thing on this list I wouldn't recommend.  This was my first time to Andre's new spot and I was blown away.  Even the chicken and waffles were very, very good!  I will point out a few things I would order again.  Without a doubt, I'd get the foie gras, the lobster roll with fries, escargots, beignets, and the lemon tart.  For me, those were the standouts.  Service was excellent.  Water glasses were constantly refilled and our coffee cups never wanted for refilling.  Now that I've had the brunch offerings, it will soon be time to go back for dinner service,  It's great having a French restaurant that's a quick 10 minute drive from home.",

I wish the cocktail prices were a little lower to match the other restaurants  nearby, but it isn't a huge deal. If you want to stop by I highly recommend the french onion soup and potato gnocchi. The last time I visited I brought my dog and we sat on the patio with no problems. Overall it's a great semi-upscale neighborhood restaurant and I'll be back for more gnocchi soon!",

First off, i walked in and stood there for a couple minutes and not one person approached me, welcomed me, acknowledged that i was there, nor asked if I have been helped. So i was just standing there staring at the menus, and mind you i work at the hospital as a nurse so i came in and expect to get right out for a quick lunch break, but still nothing, and it wasnt at all busy. So i approached the bar and finally made eye-contact with the bartender and said i was there for pick up.  I received the bill $17 something. i paid with $20 and said just to keep the change. All she said was \"do you atleast want the receipt?\" No thank you or nothing. Im driving and actually took a look at the bill and this is what really burst my bubble. They charged 18% gratuity ! ... for a Chicken Sandwhich! For a bill of ONE PERSON! FOR AN ORDER FOR PICK UP! Blew my mind, i have never seen any establishment charge gratuity for a one person one sandwhich take out bill. so basically i paid for TWO TIPS, in which they were actually undeserving of it given the lack of hospitality and unfriendly bartending service (blonde hair, no smile whatsoever). Im more so obligated to give 1 star on here but if it was up to me no star. Unbelievable.",

However, I won't take a large group here again until I've had a good experience - all but one person in the group I took was disappointed and frankly, surprised at the poor execution.  Absolutely everything was wrong when I took a group of 8 here. One of our group was a chef, so I was particularly embarrassed I'd planned this dinner out.  The food was decent, but the numerous mistakes on nearly every order combined with the server errors in judgment and tactics made for an unpleasant experience. Just a small sampling of numerous mistakes made: several people got the wrong dish - when one came out wrong a second time, the server stated the first dish was still in the back and he could go get it again! I ordered mussels, and had to ask for a bowl for shells, then use the spoon they brought me instead of a fork. We had to keep picking up our plates and handing them to the server so he'd take them away. A medium rare steak was medium well.   And what is with the space on the side that looks like a soup kitchen? We all loved the dining and bar area, but couldn't figure out what the other room was about.",

We started out with a cocktail, can't remember the name but it had ginger syrup.  The flavor reminded me of Chinese medicine tonics, not too bad.  There was plenty of french bread and butter.  Be careful not to fill up on that. The escargots was OK, it was covered in a parsley butter sauce, a little different.  The 'piece de resistance' was the Andre burger, it was moist flavorful, well seasoned and not a hint of dryness.  Definitely one of the best burgers we've ever had.  The duck fat fries were yummy, so were the sweet potato fries.  The fois gras hot dog was fine, though the burger beat it out.  The desserts were pot du creme, a fairly rich chocolate mousse and creme brulee.  Both were excellent.  We were the waitress's suggestion and took a bite from each to mix it up.    The best thing was the bill was only $43 including tip because of the 3-6pm happy hour special.  Each entree was only $7 the burger, escargots and gourmet dog.  The main entrees were a little more.  The desserts were $4 each.  Must remind myself to try the souffle next time.",

Currently closed on weekday afternoons for renovation, the announcement of what's to come not yet made but apparently exciting, it was after speaking with General Manager Joe Marsco and providing a budget that a menu was left in the hands of Chefs Chris Bulen and Kevin Lopez, the latter making delivery right on time complete with an abundance of plates, utensils and napkins.  Not a place to cut corners in terms of Ingredients or presentation whether on-site or catering, insulated chafing dishes holding temperatures for nearly three hours until Chef Lopez returned to pack leftovers and collect serviceware, it was starting with housemade Baguettes and good Butter that some filled their plate with Salad, the fresh mix at first confusing some who assuming a bottle of Dressing was Gravy but widely praised later when topped in bitter-sweet Vinaigrette.  Focused next on Sides, most of the staff unfamiliar with French Cuisine but happy to learn by way of silky Mashed Potatoes, it was surprising that many also gravitated to tender Potato Dumplings set against Butternut Squash and Sauteed Spinach, the herbaceous sauce far better than when last experienced at the Restaurant and an absolutely wonderful choice for those averse to Meat.    Onward to Entrees, the Chicken quite literally slipping off bones amidst Onions, Mushrooms and Bacon in Chicken Jus, those seeking something even heartier took immense pleasure in crispy Pork that some staff called Chicharrones, though regardless of language the thick nuggets of Pork Belly were stunning atop Onions and Apples cooked down with Calvados.  Specially requesting a Birthday Cake to finish, Pastry Chef Tammy Alana's work always sure to impress, it was no different this time than so many meals at Andre's or Alize that everything looked and tasted amazing as moist Chocolate Sponge stood springy between layers of Milk Chocolate Buttercream and thick Cocoa Ganache.",

Ordered the Lyonnaise with Duck Confit, Flat Iron Steak with Duck Fat Fries and a drip coffee with the cutest presentation to enjoy al freso. Bf asked for other sauces to go with the fries and the truffle aioli went amazing with the duck fat fries.  Everything was delicious! Duck Confit was a little overwhelming for me on top of the steak and duck fat fries, so may hold off next time. Be sure to order the souffle at the beginning as it takes 20 min to prep. I got the half chocolate half grand Marnier... recommend the latter between the two. Fantastic service. A little on the pricier side so I would recommend getting the Groupon. I personally will definitely be returning for happy hour!   Get there soon because Chef Andre has officially decided to retire according to our server.

I hope to return for dinner in the near future.   The service was great during both of my visits. Service was attentive and friendly. There weren't long waits for food or anything we needed.   The Lobster Roll had great flavor and didn't hold back on the lobster. The perfectly toasted roll rounded it off. Our side of sweet potato fries were crispy and delicious. The Chicken and Waffles made with cornbread waffles were also very good. The chicken was nicely breaded and seasoned. I liked that the dish was served with both syrup and a gravy. The Sausage & Gruyere Cheese Frittata was a good meal overall with potatoes on the side, but not the most exciting meal they offer. The Beignets were light and airy with plenty of powdered sugar. The lemon curd on the side was delicious.   Even for brunch the dessert menu offers nine different options making this my kind of place. Andre's Classic Souffle was nicely presented with the sauce poured over the top tableside. It was good, but wasn't one of the best desserts I've had. No worries, the Lemon Tart on my second visit was one of the best desserts I've ever had! The lemon filling was perfectly tart and paired well with the flavorful sugar cookie crust. I loved that the top was lightly bruleed too. I'm sad that my husband and I were trying to be good and shared only one. Next time I'm getting my own.",

The lobster had a great citrus flavor and filled the toasted roll wonderfully.  The ingredients were fresh simply delightful!  I absolutely loved the breading on the chicken.  It had a nice pepper fried into the moist piece of chicken. The accompanied waffles just put it over the top.  They were made from corn bread batter which is always a favorite of mine.  I would highly recommend either one of these delicious plates.    I was full. I was satisfied! Thank you Nate and Andre's for a lovely brunch!",

The atmosphere is modern yet welcoming. The service is outstanding and they work hard to meet and anticipate your needs.   We've sampled starters such as the escargot, French onion soup, frog legs, and the charcuterie board. All the starters have been fantastic, with exception of the frog legs which were only good.   The entrees we've tried are the Andre's burger, the lamb burger, and the coco au vin (chicken braised in wine) all have been expertly prepared and delicious. The Andre's burger is a stand out with fresh ingredients, quality meat, a wonderful bun, and perfectly cooked. The cocktails, (French 75 and their version of the Mai Tai) are strong and tasty showing creativity, the pino noir is amazing, but their coffee needs work. The chocolate souffle is sumptuous, rich, and the perfect way to end a great meal.",

Do your belly a favor and order them (trust me)! In addition to the exceptional service provided by our extremely knowledgeable server Jose (whose sense of humor was delightful) the restaurant itself is comfortable.   What We Ordered  Beignets $7.00 5/5 Escargot $12.00 Surprisingly, smooth texture considering the mental picture I had of eating Spongebob's best friend Gary. Moules Frites $24.00 Great flavor and the fries are a great balance Lobster Roll $18.00 5/5  Souffle $12.00 1/5 Absolutely terrible grand marnier flavored dessert.  Overpowering egg like flavors.  Bottomless Rose $22.00 5/5   $108+ tip I'll be back!",

    "text": "Came to Andre's yesterday after our new roommate saw a picture on Facebook of their seared Foie Gras.   We arrived at about 4pm, right in the middle of happy hour, which is daily from 3-6.   We tried:  Cheese and charchuterie board:  This was excellent.  several different cheeses, meats, tiny pickles, currants.  The cheeses ranged from mild to super funky (and all of them delicious!).  The prosciutto and the spicy pork were my favorite meats.  Seared foie gras: When this came out, we were honestly quite disappointed.  The photo we had seen on Facebook showed a large piece of Foie...what came out was a tiny scrap that liquefied when we tried to cut into it.  It was severely under cooked.  We sent it back, and shortly received a properly cooked much larger portion.   Once we got the proper cook, it was absolutely delicious.  Served over brioche with figs and a balsamic reduction with hazelnuts, this was worth the trip.    Sunday plate: Duck A L'Orange:  Duck breast served over a crispy waffle with orange sauce, fois gras, and spinach.  This was delightful.  The duck was cooked to perfection, the spinach was lovely, and the waffle was excellent: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.    For dessert we had the creme brulee, which was the best creme brulee I have ever had.  I definitely would come back just for this.    Service was very nice and prompt.  All the servers and the hostess were courteous and personable.    I like the vibe of the restaurant.  Classy, where you absolutely could dress up for a nice meal, but still casual enough to feel comfortable in jeans.  We sat on the patio which was nice and quiet.    I would most definitely come back again for happy hour, and Andre's also offers a tea service, so we will be coming back in a few weeks to try that out.",

Both were delicious but the mussels were amazing as were the fries that came with them. They also give you a baguette for the table in a cute little bag.   I'm so glad to have Andre's in the neighborhood since it is one of the few options in the area that is perfect for a date night or brunch with the girls. Pricing is reasonable and ambience is nice.  I feel like the bottomless mimosas would be more appropriate at $15 but $22 is not bad.   Service was great! Everyone was friendly and our server even brought out a birthday candle for me. I can't wait to come back for dinner and happy hour.",

    "text": "I just want to say, I'm very disappointed.....in myself that I did not come here sooner. I cannot count how many times I've passed by this restaurant and told myself \"I need to try this place.\" After seeing that they were participating in Restaurant Week, I finally made the effort to go!   Andre's is located in the old DW Bistro. It's a great neighborhood restaurant and honestly, for those living in the southwest, we are lucky! It was a busy night when we went (Thursday night) so I would recommend making reservations. We got seated right away which was nice. Service was great from beginning to end. I should've gotten the name of our server! I had asked him some questions regarding the menu and he was able to answer them without any hesitation, so props to him.   Onto the food!   - Wagyu beef carpaccio: loved this! It has a nice contrast with the smoked sea salt and capers.   - Seared foie gras: this was definitely melt-in-your-mouth type tx. It comes with figs (?) and basalmic reduction along with shaved parmesan.   - duck a l'orange: it was cooked perfectly. I was expecting more of a orange taste to it (bc name of entree) but the sauce that came with it is lightly seasoned with the orange taste.   - lobster thermidor: omg this was phenomenal! It came in a bowl. The bottom of it consisted of mashed potatoes, and there were asparagus and mushrooms. Big chunks of lobster too.   - creme brulee: you can tell it's made with real vanilla beans bc there's black specks in the custard. I really liked this dessert. There was a nice crunch from the sugar coating and the custard itself wasn't super sweet.   - chocolate walnut gateau: This was meh for me. But honestly it's bc I'm not a huge fan of walnuts. The dark chocolate layer on top was good though.  I will definitely be back! I really liked everything that was served.",

    "text": "Updated review for Restaurant Week 2018. I selected Andre's for the three course restaurant week dinner because the menu was a tribute to Anthony Bourdain. Appetizer - Escargot Entree - Duck a l orange Dessert - Chocolate Walnut Gateau  We had reservations and seated immediately. The dining room was nearly filled. Our server Nate was on point. He took our cocktail order right after we were seated and in a few minutes after the cocktails arrived he took our dinner order and provided a loaf of bread with butter, olive oil and balsamic. The escargots, six to an order were plump and tender in a tasty garlic herb butter sauce. The bread was perfect to sop up the sauce. Yum  The duck breast was cooked medium rare, sliced and sitting on a bed of spinach and  along side the dauphinoise potato cake with duck confit topped with orange slices. Surrounding the plate was a pool of gravy. Wow it was a rich brown delicious gravy.  The chocolate walnut gateau  was chocolate glazed caramel, walnut torte with creme anglaise. A marvelous finish.  A minor glitch during the evening was that a side order of green beans was not delivered with the entree and arrived later after our server was advised. Removal of empty plates was slow which appeared to be the need for additional support staff as the servers were working flat out.",

    "text": "Reading Yelper's friends review, I was like I must try it! Great to know a French restaurant is 10mns away from home and away from the strip. Location is great near Patrick and Fort Apache. We decided to sit at the booth. Place is nice, charming. Waiters were pleasant. From our table I had a great panoramic of the restaurant and spacious patio. The bar well loaded and has a nice seating area. It was our first time here so I called a friend to join for the happy hour 3pm to 6pm daily including weekend. We ordered - escargots de bourgogne persilles - seared Foie Gras - plateau de charcuterie - salade lyonnaise with duck leg confit (in France the salade is with warm potato) - onion soup - souffle half chocolate, half grand marnier  Escargot were ok, I added some salt to make it more tasty. I didn't taste the parsley butter at all :/ Charcuterie platter was well presented. Portion were too small. They could add some fresh grape fruits. Not sure if portion is smaller during Happy hour (saw other yelpers pics) the Pate was 1/4 of the one pictured on most pics posted :( Seared foie gras was excellent ($24) and the salade lyonnaise as well. Salad dressing was delicious. If you just want an onion soup for dinner, you might have to order 2... the portion is an appetizer portion. The Souffle was good but little disappointed. I couldn't taste the good french chocolate at all. CPK chocolate souffle is even tastier   My experience was mitige (half/half). Super happy to have a nice french close by. The staff was nice and on top of it. We booked a table at 5:30pm to enjoy the happy hour. It would be nice to make a last call on happy hours. I just noticed they did not apply the happy hours on 2 items :/ not cool!",

Went with my girlfriends around 4 pm and found out they have happy hour from 3-6 pm everyday! You heard me right, everyday and in the entire restaurant, not just bar area.  Beautiful wine selection, by the glass is $2 off for happy hour. I ordered a sparkling rose which was light and crisp.   Our server was very friendly and suggested some good vegetarian and Vegan options. I love gnocchi so decided to try that. It was delicious, served in a light creamy butter sauce, tender melt in your mouth gnocchi topped with crispy thin onions. My friends tried mushroom risotto which was fantastic.  If you love souffle, their Grand mariner and chocolate souffle is an absolute must! I tried cream brulee which was excellent, the crust on top was perfect.   I can't wait to return and try the rest of the menu :)",

    "text": "I debated heavily on writing this review as I am a fan of this place and want to give it some love BUT I didn't want to let out one of my secret spots. This gem that is hidden in a strip mall on the west side of town where many people do not venture out to. They are situated at the old DW Birsto location for those of you who remember.  The food here is a great representation of French food and is beautiful! There are many awesome eats at this place: Andre's burger is one of my favorites on the menu. Such a well balanced burger and at a great price on happy hour.   Recommendations to eat here:  The lobster thermador. It is on occasion the plat du jour (special of the day). If you have never had this dish, it is highly recommended. It's a very flavorful dish. Crazy creamy sauce and lobster covered in cheese.  Prime Rib  Steak Frites: simple goodness... steak and French fries. Can't go wrong on this.  Lobster Roll. The rendition here is a slaw style one as opposed to the type you would find in New England ( just meat on a roll) that we all are accustomed to. The slaw mix with the lobster is very tasty and does not take anything away from the lobster.  French onion soup. Always solid cheesey goodness.   Another plus at this place is that they serve Fitz's Root Beer; those mid-west people know what I am talking about!  Andres is one of my favorite spots on the west side. Eat with confidence.",

    "text": "Services: 2 stars Food: 3.5 stars  Atmosphere:4 stars   I have been here quite a few times for both brunch and dinner. I enjoy some of the items a lot but I feel like they need to work on consistency here. The services here I received majority of the time also turned me off.   Services: on my recent visit, this old waiter with the accent made me not wanting to come back. He had my table before the recent visit as well. I was not a fan of him because he's not polite and borderline rude. On our entire visit, he only came to check on us once at the beginning and handed us the check. I had to get another server to take our order. And the other server was the one who came back and refilled the water. He explained to me that the older gentleman was \"busy\". He passed by our table several times. He never once acknowledged us. What was the worst was when he handed us the bill, he didn't say anything AT All! Not a thank you, not a sorry that I wasn't able to take care of you guys earlier. Just dead silence. He needs to be trained how to be a server. His behavior was absolutely not acceptable. I appreciate the other younger server who took care of us though.   Food: I like the food here for the most part. However, they are not consistent.   Things I have tried:   1. French Onion Soup (3/5): I loved their French onion soup the first time I've had it and I recommended it to my friends who lover this dish. However, like other yelper mentioned, where's all the cheese? For some reason, the cheese wasn't there the second time I had it and it was disappointing.   2. Lyonnaise Salad (5/5): I usually add the duck with my salad. It is delicious with the perfectly poached egg. They can also split into two for you. You can add additional egg for another person.   3. Escargot (4/5): the sauce is yummy with their baguette.   4. Seared Foie Gras (4/5): I've only had it once. It was good but not the best I've had.    5. Moules Frites (2/5): it was lacked of flavors and a boring dish.   6. Flat iron steak (2/5): I ordered medium rare and it came out medium well?! Did not enjoy my steak at all. Duck Fat fries was still good then.   7. Andres burger (5/5): the burger is really good! I suggest your share the burger and get a salad with someone else. The flavor was excellent. However, it's quite greasy to eat the whole burger if you don't have a big appetite.   8. Chicken and waffles (2/5): what happened to the whole waffle! We only got half of the waffles. The pictures from other yelper came with the whole waffles (4pc). We only got 2 pieces. Since we were not that hungry, we didn't ask the server. Even the two pieces were super tiny. I wouldn't order it again. Better flavored chicken and waffles elsewhere.   9. Duck Fat Fries (3/5): I used to love it but on my recent visits, the flavor of duck fat was not there.   10. Souffle (5/5): Love the grand mariner souffle here. One of the best in town.   11. Quiche Lorraine (4/5): I enjoyed the quiche. But the potato on the side was meh.   Their kitchen needs to be more organized too. One time I took my friend there to celebrate her engagement. We basically finished my dish before they were able to serve hers. She ended up getting it togo. In all, there's definitely recommended dishes from this place, however, if the consistency and quality of the services can't be provided. I foresee this place will have the same fate as the one in Monte Carlo and Alize.",

    "text": "Where do I begin? I've never been the one to write a review immediately after trying out a place but this is a different case. The low star rating is in no regards to the quality of the food. The food was great and nicely prepared but was it timely? So, so. Were we able to place our order in a timely manner? No. Quite frankly, the food was the only positive thing about this experience but sadly it's not worth coming back for the service or lack thereof that my friends and I received.   We had set reservations for 11:15 today for brunch. My girls and I arrived in a timely manner and we were actually a few minutes early. We were seated once our time came. Mind you, they were also hosting an event/private party in the other room and it was fairly busy for a Sunday but that's expected. What is also expected is to be able to place our order within 15-20 minutes of being seated, but it took 45 minutes or so for us to just place our order. Not once did anyone come by to check on us until after someone finally took our order. The food came out about 20 minutes or so after being placed. I wouldn't have mind it if I wasn't already having hunger pains from waiting just to place my order.   I understand that they had a full house and an event next door but they should have staffed their restaurant adequately in order to serve their guests. What was even more bothersome was that two tables next to us who had been newly seated; they were able to place their order shortly after being seated and received their food before we did. I get it, shit happens. People call out, you get short staffed, whatever. My friends and I would have been more understanding for the delay if we were addressed as such; \"Hey! Sorry for the delay, we're a little short staffed but what can we do for you guys until then?\". Or where was the manager? The manager could've helped his staff and been like, \"Hey! We're short staffed, let me take your guys order\". But no, we were overlooked repeatedly.   When we finally got our food, it was good. I was expecting to get it by Christmas by the way they were moving but nonetheless, the food was good. I had the Breakfast sandwich with a side salad. You can choose between ham & bacon. It has two eggs any style, gruyere cheese, pretzel bun, & truffle mayo. The others ordered the lobster roll, the Lorraine quiche, and beignets. Everything came out great. But the overall experience, tainted the quality of the food. I have no plans to return this place. I don't have the patience nor the time. It is such a disappointment considering I've heard good things about this place and the food was good but the overall experience and service is not worth it.",

I tried not to hog the bread to myself. (We are both bread lovers) . Then I tried the Beet salad which was amazing . It had walnuts, goat cheese...seems simple but it was delicious! I also liked that they didn't used canned beets you can tell they were fresh. I was craving the Fall  Risotto ($21.00) because I haven't had Risotto in a while. This dish didn't disappoint and it was very filling. It had roasted mushrooms, sage butter and Parmesan cheese.  I tried my friend's steak and frites which was good but I was happier with my order. I ended my meal with the Chocolate Pot De Creme ($8.00) It's an oven baked chocolate custard topped with Chantilly cream and a homemade vanilla cookie. I wish this dessert came with more cookies because I liked paring it with the custard. The service was wonderful and our waiter was really nice.",

The table setting was nice with mismatched teacups and saucers, and nice silver table service.  I have been to other afternoon teas in Las Vegas such as Bellagio, Mandarin Oriental, Bellagio, and Lake Las Vegas.  For the price of this Tea at Andre's, it was nice ($26).  The price of the other teas are double Andre's which includes parking distance at large resorts.  Our Service was Good but at the end, it was like our server disappeared (he was assisting other diners).  Food was good but not Great.  The main tea I wanted to try, 8 Treasures, was not available.  I enjoyed my time here and despite the few hiccups, I would return.",

Service - 1 star It took almost 30 minutes before we were able to order and our food didn't arrive until over an hour after we arrived. No one stopped to see how we were doing. Even though we did ask if the kids foot could come out early, and were told it would, we got all of our food at the same time and at this point the kids were starving  Beignets - 5 stars These were delicious. Hot, sweet and amazing.  If everything else hadn't t been so horrible I would be back for these.   Kids mac and cheese - 1 star for kids, 3 stars for an adult This is not a kids mac and cheese.  It may be on the kids menu but it's not for kids.  Bread crumbs on top and made with a strong flavored cheese.  The cheese to noodle ratio was also way off with the noodles swimming in cheese and the noodles were way over cooked to mush. Neither of the kids that ordered it ate it which was lucky for me (see below).   Kids chicken fingers - 2 stars for kids, 4 for adults Also and adult dish hiding on the kids menu.  My son loved the fries. The chicken fingers had some sort of spice in the breading.  I thought they were delicious but none of the kids would eat them. Also, this plate came out scalding hot. The waiter carried it out with a napkin and warned us how hot the plate was.  When I pointed out it was for a one year old and we would like a cool plate the set it down anyway and said it wasn't that hot. When I touched it I almost burned myself.  Considering toddlers reach out and grab everything I'm lucky we didn't walk away with blisters.  Despite the temperature of the plate, the food was ice cold. Lucky for me, my some likes cold food so he still ate the fries.   Brioche French Toast - 1 star I ate one bite of the French toast which was both greasy and cold.  I'm not sure how you make French toast greasy.  The waiter asked how the food was after I had the first bite and I mentioned it was cold. He took it back and after everyone else was half done with their meals, he brought back the same plate which was now lukewarm and rubbery.  It had clearly been stuck in a microwave.    Ceaser salads - 1 star Neither person that ordered one had more than 2 bites.   My friends did get the quiche and French onion soup and said both were good.    I ended up eating cold chicken fingers and mushy noodles swimming in cheese.  No one in the restaurant seemed to notice that the vast majority of food that we ordered went uneaten. Needless to say we won't be back.",

    "text": "Went for brunch and were greeted by a friendly server and hostess. We started with the escargots that went well with the fresh French bread. Ordered the steak frites which was beyond small even for a lunch portion. Waiter said it should be at least 5oz. I imagine it was no more than 4oz...4 slices of steak?! Thought the flavor was good, but I've never seen a restaurant serve anything that small, not even a filet. I had the mussels. The flavor was good but menu read \"served with tomato, parsley, garlic, etc\" and they came out in a saffron cream sauce. When the server insists there are tomatoes in the sauce and can't understand that's not the point - the menu doesn't mention CREAM...the description needs to be rewritten. The food tastes fine but the execution and menu need more attention.",

Alfredo was our server and he made great suggestions and was very attentive and personable. There is a huge wine selection and he suggested the perfect Boudreaux. We had the foie gras which was the best foie gras I've ever had! It was lightly seared and melted in your mouth. The escargot was probably the best I've ever had as well. Next was the prime rib which was massive and super tender. we had a chocolate cake for dessert which was recommended as well. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Excellent restaurant off the strip. Its nice to have a higher quality local restaurant and not have to schlep out to the strip just for dinner. The new location is in a plain strip mall, but the restaurant itself has great curb appeal. It has the same layout of the former DW Bistro, but it has a French farm-to-table feel once you walk inside.  The blonde waitress we had (apologize that the name escapes me if she is reading this) was excellent and has been with Andre for a number of years. Always a good sign when the staff is loyal to the brand! We all ordered French onion soup and I had the mussels and frites. French Onion Soup was a tad underwhelming considering that we were at a French restaurant but the mussels and frites were divine. Mussels is my go-to order whenever I see it on a menu, and Andres' mussels reminded me of the time I lived in France- so good!  Of course we had to try the grand mariner souffle which was the best thing I had all night. Make sure you place your order with your food! It was heaven.  I checked out their brunch menu while I was there, looks excellent and can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "We walked in on a busy Sunday morning. This place was filled with people and seemed so promising. Our server was kind and cheerful and seemed eager to serve us.    First bad part, we were sat down in the middle of two other tables when there were other tables that were open. The people to our left seemed to be planning a bridal shower and were talking loudly. I came to eat a good brunch, not listen to other people's plans.   Then, the food took some time to arrive and honestly, it looks way better than it tastes. We ordered the lobster roll, chicken and waffles, and also the chocolate souffle which added up to about $50. A friend recommended this place so we had high expectations and we felt nothing but disappointment. The lobster roll was covered in mayo, and seemed more like a lobster slaw inside a bread bun if anything. The waffles were super doughy and soft and the sauce made it even worse. The chicken wasn't crunchy what so ever. It was super mushy and I believe it was the sauces fault also. In my opinion, replacing the sauce with maple syrup on the side would have helped make it somewhat better. The souffle was just nothing special.   The sad part about it all, was that the complimentary bread and butter tasted better than the meals we had ordered.   There was also a server walking around, asking different tables if what he was carrying was their order. Sir, you should know where you are bringing your food to.   Not planning on coming here ever again and would not recommend anyone to either.",

Service has been excellent every time. Shout out to Alfredo at brunch today! Haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't delicious. Stand-out items were the steak frites (traditional bistro faire done right), the creme brulee (the shining example of what it should be), Caesar salad (classic with the right amount of garlic and anchovy), and moules frites (perfectly prepared mussels and duck fat fries). A side note on the duck fat fries: If you're a fat phobe, you're missing out. These are French fries as god intended. A leisurely stroll to a lovely bistro with great food and great service.  Next, I'm trying happy hour!  Truly transporting.  Merci, Andre!",

The sausage omelette was one of top 5 omelettes I have ever had. Ingredients inside were generously portioned and perfectly cooked. The accompanied potatoes were great with a sauteed onion extra included. Accompany that with $25 bottomless mimosas and you'll surely enjoy your meal. The best part is brunch lasts until 3:30pm so your mimosas won't go to waste even if you get a late start to your Saturday or Sunday.   The only couple of things knocking this review down from a 5 is the bread tasted a little stale/hard and the waiter disappeared for times. He was great when he came around and was very nice, but we couldn't track him down when it came time to order some extras like hot sauce or drinks.   But overall this is one of the better brunches in town and for sure the best in the southwest.",

It was seared, but tasted burnt and part of the fat of a steak with a liver aftertaste. The combo was weird also, it came with a sweet berry cream-like sauce and almond crumble. If they hadnt given me bread I probably wouldnt have finished it.   The lamb shank was better. Very large portion. I don't think they should serve it with orzo pasta, the sauce had an overpowering tomato taste. Mashed potatoes, veggies, or even couscous would be better.

The frites, fried in duck fat, were perfectly garnished with garlic - a delectable combination of mussels and frites as a result.  Had escargot as an appetizer - good but my preference is for stronger wine and garlic in the sauce.  Service was attentive without being obtrusive.  All in all a very pleasant dinner.

My hubby brought me here for an early birthday dinner & after months of looking at the pictures on Yelp and friends confirming how good is was i knew we had to try it; we were not disappointed:) First we started with a couple of shots & shortly after we got bread & butter to enjoy until our entrees came out. I got the lobster roll w duck fat fries as my side. I was pretty impressed. Some places just shove a bunch of lobster on a soggy bun and call it a day ; however, this lobster roll had just enough lobster & the roll was perfectly grilled. Had just the right amount of seasoning. The duck fat fries omg!!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Hubby got Andres Burger (which we split both the roll and burger) & we both approved! Typical burger, but loaded with flavor and really juicy. Only thing we ordered well done, but there was a good amount of pink, no complaints though we didn't say anything. He got regular fries because I don't think he liked how \"duck fat\" fries sounded lol but he had some of mine & he said they were amazing & he will be getting them next time! Last but not least, dessert. We got the half chocolate half grand manier (spell check) which was the only thing I was kind of disappointed in. Just not what i was expecting I guess? More mouse like than the lava cake type of flavor and experience I was expecting. We will be back for sure!",

We had the house made sausages, Andre's burger (they asked how we wanted it, so we went with rare) and the pot de creme for dessert. And plenty of drinks. Perfect way to end the day with a semi-causal romantic dinner!",

    "text": "For my first meal of 2018, I came here. I didn't know anything about it other than it had frog legs on the menu, and I wanted them. It's in a good location not far from 215. I got there around 4:30PM so it wasn't too busy, yet, but happy hour is between 3-6PM. I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and almost too accommodating, but without being pushy. This was appreciative. It almost felt like he was being a good host at his house, rather than an employee behind the bar.  Aside from the frog legs, I saw they also had escargot (which I also like) but I opted for the cheese and charcuterie board instead. The frog legs didn't take long at all. They were good but maybe just a tad bland, though that's less of the frog and more of the batter surrounding it. I would have like a little more flavor, personally. The cheese and meat board was excellent. There was a nice variety of meat, cheese, pate, fruit, and olives. On top of that, combining different things yielded so many different flavors. Highly recommended.  While it isn't necessarily close to my house, I'm definitely going to come back, especially for happy hour. Prices on most of the menu are reduced, including beer and wine.",

I had a scrumptious Bloody Mary and he had a sazerac.   We shared the mussels with duck fat fries and the lobster roll with green salad as we were in the mood for savory lunch vs. the sweets. There were lots of options on the menu. These two dishes were excellent! Fries were divine. Mussels were tender and flavorful and huge. I honestly didn't love having to bite into them but it's not their fault they got giant mussels. The lobster roll was generous for the price and tasted fresh and scrumptious on the buttery roll.   We were stuffed so we didn't make it to a souffle or beignets despite our interest. Our bill was $62 which I thought was very reasonable for cocktails and nice seafood. Additionally, they had a Groupon at the time so it really was a steal!  Ambiance is nice and service was excellent.   We would certainly return for another meal service or brunch again.",

We have been there several times for brunch so we knew the food would be delicious. Which of course it was. Many compliments on the lobster roll and salmon. The most amazing experience of the night was the service that was provided. Jana who coordinated everything for us was so thorough and kind. Once we got there, Lori was the coordinator who assisted us. She went above and beyond to accommodate our every request and every need. We couldn't thank her enough to making this celebration a memorable night. Additionally the pastry chef designed a beautiful 3-tier cake for us. We can't stop looking at the pictures. The entire night was a celebration that exceeded our expectations. Thank you!",

This place used to be DW bistro so when we went inside and looked around it still looked similar but the dinner settings were very dim. There were candles lit on our table and we used them to look at the menu. The service was okay not super amazing. Everything we wanted off the menu our server said was not available so I stuck with the chicken which was mediocre to say the least. I was pretty disappointed a lot of the foods that were posted on yelp that we wanted were unavailable and the server kept telling us that unfortunately since they opened not too long before we came they've revamped the menu a bit so some foods they will no longer serve. Our table ordered the moules frites which was a pretty hefty portion and okay. Also, Escargot was something everyone tried at the table. That was good. I'd like to maybe give this place another try during happy hour or lunch to see if things may be different.",

This new location is cozy albeit in a strip mall, but the food is still a excellent quality.  I had the fois gras app and the lobster thermador, delish!   Service was excellent, a more casual version of the original, which is just fine for a Friday night.",

    "text": "Well, where do I even begin!!! And I wish was saying that because my experience was great, but it was FAR from great. It was actually ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.   My sister made our Mother's Day reservation via OpenTable for 6pm. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and we were seated WITHOUT any menus. Waited about 10 mins before a waiter came with the menus. Not sure if our waiter even introduced himself.  We ordered some appetizers while we waited for the rest of our party. When they brought us our waters they mentioned that they would bring us bread. Mind you that we had already been sitting there for quite some time.  Appetizers came still no bread and butter and two glasses on the table didn't have any water. We had to ask for bread  since they never brought it in the first place. We finished our appetizers and still no bread so we asked for it once AGAIN.  We began ordering our main courses and to our surprise there were a few items that were no longer available. (At most other restaurants, when items are not available waiters let guests know beforehand, like when they are seated, so that the guests can find other options.)  Ok, so we've placed our orders and the bread FINALLY got to the table. They couldn't even get that right! We were an 8 top and they serve one half of the loaf (serves about 5 people)! Are you kidding me! We had to ask for more bread!  The first of the main entrees finally get to the table- they served the kid's chicken fingers and fries and the rest of the table had to wait about another 5-10 minutes before for their food. Of course the orders were messed up. Cobb Salad, which you would assume is a lot easier to make than steaks, arrived LAST! I personally ordered the Flat Iron Steak with bearnaise sauce, cooked medium, and a side of mashed potatoes. BUT I got a WELL DONE steak mashed potatoes and NO sauce. Also, typically when you order steaks, the waiter brings steak knives but just ANOTHER thing we as the diners had to ask for! Oh the reason for my steak being OVERCOOKED?!? Apparently it was sitting under the heat lamp too long! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! WHAT KIND OF HEAT LAMPS ARE THEY USING!!!! They said they were going to re-cook the steak but at this point I was so anger that this was the experience that I lost my appetite completely.  They served the filet steak medium rare when it was asked to be cooked medium with a side of mushrooms- of course they didn't get the side right for that either! Instead of mushrooms they brought mashed potatoes! WHAT ELSE CAN GO WRONG!!!!!  FINALLY, I go find the manager to let him know what's going on. He was going to fix the problem by offering free desserts but at that point we all just really wanted to leave!  We were seated next to a family who had to be friends or family of one of the waiters so of course they were attended to without any problems. . THE BEST of all the excuses!!!! Our waiter told us that they had been there all day and that were short staffed- what an excuse for the WORSE SERVICE I HAVE EXPERIENCED! (Mind you my family and I eat out at plenty of different restaurants all over the city and this by FAR IS THE WORST!)  I would normally say I would give Andre's Bistro another try, but after everything that happened I AM ABSOLUTELY TURNED OFF.   I have NEVER EVER jrefused my food be remade. I normally let them fix the mistake BUT this was not going to fix anything. Between the wait time, having to ask our waiter for everything, and messing up on orders. I was over this place!!!!!   SUCH A SHAME!   I hope that they figure their issues out and I hope that their waiters come up with better excuses!",

We have been wanting to check Andre's out since it opened, and finally went  yesterday for Restaurant Week, which supports Three Square. The Restaurant Week menu was a tribute to Anthony Bourdain, who we really love and miss. Wife had the French Onion soup and the Duck a l'Orange while I went with the  Beef Carpaccio and Steak Frites. We both had the Creme Brulee for dessert. The soup was so deliciously cheesy! You could not pull the spoon out without strands of cheese following. The carpaccio was also very good, with the highlight being the parmesan and smoked sea salt. MY wife had never tried Duck a l'Orange before, and the one time I had it was disappointing. This was absolutely amazing!!! The flavor and tenderness of the duck was perfect. Almost melted in your mouth. She also loved the potatoes with the duck confit.  The flat iron steak was very tender and surprising thick, even though it was just a bit past my requested medium rare, and even better when dipped in the bearnaise sauce. The duck fat fries were to die for! Hands down the best fries I've ever had. Then again, I've never had duck fat fries before.  I'm not big on sweets, but I actually finished the Creme Brulee! Perfect balance of sweet and savory for me (yes, I watch way too much Food Network!). My wife said it was the best she'd ever had. So glad we finally went, and we look forward to going again.",

Everything about this restaurant is excellent, from the greeting by Patrick and John  (they are genuinely happy you are there), to the ambience, to the service, and last but not least to  the incredibly delicious and exquisitely prepared food.  We dined there last night which was the first day!  You would never have guessed that because everything was seamless.   The mood is casual with soft lighting.  You can dress up or be casual, it is comfortable either way.  Service is top notch.  Our server, Mike, really knew the menu and made outstanding wine pairings.  The evening started with perfect crunchy French bread and sweet butter.  After that, we enjoyed a Caesar salad that was the real thing...beautiful Romaine leaves, homemade croutons, and dressing with anchovies.  The next course was a stunning preparation of foie gras with thinly sliced cooked apples and a vanilla sauce, which paired beautifully with my champagne.  Our entrees were the salmon with lentils and the hangar steak with green peppercorn sauce and Duck fat fries.  Everything was flavorful and perfectly prepared.  We finished with the lemon tart, something that I have been dreaming of since the days of Andre's on 6th Street.  My dream came True...just as delicious as I remembered.   Andre's is, quite simply, Fabulous!",

This had nothing to do with us.  I understand when a kitchen can be unorganized and run behind.  We ordered the Souffle for dessert when our order as taken at 11:40, at 1pm they said that the souffle would take 15 minutes to make and successfully talked us out of the $12 dessert.  We ordered something that we could take with us since we had spent so much time in the restaurant.  We ordered off the menu, an $8 piece of cake each, and they charged us for it because it was not on the Restaurant Week menu (that they had the inability to produce within a 95 minute timeline)  They gave us 20% off, but the dessert was added at $16 and the discount was $11.20)  The food was good, but servicewise I will not go back.",

Plated beautifully and great service and conversation. I would highly recommend Andre's for a great lunch or dinner spot.",

    "text": "I went out to this neighborhood place on a recommendation and was expecting a great meal - thinking I probably should have hit anyplace on the strip and just overpaid or hit the In N Out.  I was there on a Thursday night and it wasn't particularly busy, but the servers seemed ill-prepared and overwhelmed (reminded me of monkeys running around the cage at the zoo).  I was never really sure who my server was as my order was taken by the hostess (who seemed to be the one bright spot on the staff).  I ordered a ribeye and spinach and a glass of wine.  When my steak came it was not even warm (I ordered it Med rare) so I sent it back.  It came back to me in about 5 minutes and it really wasn't any warmer so they offered to make me a new one and the chef was bringing it out himself.  This one was warm, but it was the oddest looking ribeye that I have ever seen - it had a really odd shape and looked like someone took a bite out of the center.  However, the steak had very little, if any, seasoning and was the toughest ribeye I have ever had - tougher than a strip steak and it really didn't taste very good.  Maybe order the next grade up of steak from Sysco or at the local grocery store where this meat must have come from (sarcasm).  I should mention that the spinach was good - very simple, but good.  They did end up comping my steak (charging me just for the wine), but I would have rather had a good steak.  I was a bit surprised that I never heard from or saw a manager and I did send them an email when I got back home detailing my experience and never heard back.   One of the most disappointing meals and overall experiences that I have had at a restaurant in quite a while.",

    "text": "What a wonderful neighborhood experience bringing the strip to the locals of southwest Las Vegas.  Truly happy with this cozy little gem in my neighborhood with a fun French fare.  The room is warm and comfortable, beautiful wine list, delicious food, and extremely knowledgeable waitstaff.  Ask for Mike W. as he is kind, attentive, and well educated in food and wine!  We had a romantic date pairing wines with our 3 course meal all delivered in a timely fashion allowing us to talk and relax.  The chilled seafood platter was divine, steaks tender, and the chocolate dessert decadent!  We will be back!",
