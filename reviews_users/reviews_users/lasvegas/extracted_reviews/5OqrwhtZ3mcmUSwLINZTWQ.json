    "text": "Dining in Vegas is always an experience. With all the new and upcoming restaurants in the Aria, this one has to be my favorite. Authentic food mixed with a rich elegant ambiance & wood decor is what you'll find at Blossom. The wait staff is exceptionally attentive and the food hits all the right taste buds.   For appetizers we ordered the hot & sour soup and the crispy eggplant. The crispy eggplant is a must try!   For the main course we ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp, Mongolian Beef, and Vegetable Chow Mein.  Loved all of our selections, only regret is that we didn't have room for dessert.   Yes this is an upscale restaurant and you do pay a pretty penny, but in my opinion it's worth it. The dining experience + the food is well worth it.",

    "text": "What an incredible gem we recently stumbled upon while perusing ARIA for a casual dinner. What we ended up experiencing was an intimate environment with stellar service and phenomenal food.   The atmosphere is modern and beautifully lit. We were sat in a rather luxurious feeling booth overlooking a section of tables. There is a feeling of grandeur with the super tall ceilings and large round pillars.  The service was absolutely incredible. The wait staff were friendly and personable with a knowledge of the menu that left a feeling of authenticity towards the cuisine. My water glass was never empty. As a heavy water drinker, this was appreciated. They were simply on top of it.  The food was impressive. As a fan of oriental cuisine I was not expecting to wander into a resort restaurant and receive such amazing flavor. The recommended wonton soup is subsequently now my favorite version of this classic dish. We ordered a variety of dishes for the table and were satisfied with them all.  The creme brulee for dessert was a surprise. It is actually chocolate that when the topping is poured over makes the dome artfully dissolve (very neat experience!).  Bottomline: Certainly recommend Blossom for an elevated dining experience.",

    "text": "I haven't been to many fine dining places in my life, but Blossom has been hands down the best holistic eating experience for me. My first visit was a few years back after I had found some rare luck at a slot machine, and I opted for the whole Peking duck.  The ambience itself was great: intimate lighting without being too dark, clean and shiny surfaces, cool but not chilly temperatures, great view of the restaurant from any location. Service was modeled after the classical french restaurants in their golden age of haute cuisine.  I was expecting a plate of duck with the appropriate side dishes to come out, but what I got was much more impressive. A whole roasted duck with everything except the guts, feet and feathers was carted out on a huge trolley accompanied by 3 men. While I waited, they carved out the breast meat in front of me and assembled my \"sandwiches\" with the pancakes and spring onions. All I had to do was pick up the food and eat while they did all the work for me.  After the breast was gone, they carted it back in and chopped up the rest of the duck so I could eat the legs. Everything about the food was flawless - something I've never said in my life until that point and something I've never said since. Service was impeccable as well, and I decided that this was a place I would need to return to every time I went to Vegas.",

I am not partial to HK style soup because it is slightly sweet and fruity but the one of us from HK liked it a lot. My clear chicken soup with mushrooms and tofu was light but flavorful. Just right. Main dishes- ground pork topped with salted fish, tasty down-home Guangzhou fare; scallops with noodles, quite delicious, noodles properly cooked, probably a bit of a mistake to get scallops that had to travel so far, though, because hard to keep that elusive, subtle, ultra-fresh scallop taste; the ribs were fresh and both tender and tasty; the pea plants were truly excellent, as fresh as could be, perfectly cooked, and not a bit woody or stemmy. Dessert was a chocolate creme brulee with warm citrus sauce poured on top to melt through the chocolate dome, both fun to watch and delicious to eat.",

    "text": "For our second Restaurant Week meal, benefitting Three Square Food Bank, we dined at Blossom inside Aria. My brother joined us. He's matured so much over the years and I'm happy to share my love of food with him. It's something he's definitely come to appreciate. He used to eat nothing but chicken fingers and BBQ cheeseburgers. Now, he can find the value in a good meal and I respect his willingness to try new things.   Blossom receives little attention, yet reviews for the restaurant are pretty solid. Prices are steep, but in line with other fine dining Chinese restaurants. The restaurant has a lovely quiet ambience tucked away near Baccarat. Service was attentive. The Restaurant Week menu offered dinner for $50.14, we were started with Wor Wonton soup, then we had the choice of Pot Stickers or Shrimp Toast for appetizers, followed by entree selections of Crisp Fried Chilean Sea Bass or Beef Tenderloin with Portabella Mushroom, served with Pork Fried Rice. Dessert was Mochi Ice Cream.   We sampled all that was available. The Wor Wonton soup had large shrimp, scallop and two wontons with broccoli and mushrooms. The broth lacked depth, flavor improved with a spoonful of garlic sriracha.   The Potstickers were large and nicely prepared, but it was the Shrimp Toast that were memorable. Each bite was so buttery it seemed to melt in your mouth. It was a pleasant surprise.   Chilean Sea Bass is my second favorite fish, so I was very excited to dig in. The filet was deep fried and it had a nice tempura crust, but I found it unfortunate that the breading overwhelmed the natural flavor of the fish. Still, it was beautifully presented. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was nicely done, but the flavor was a bit mild for my taste. Another spoonful of sriracha, gave it the kick it needed. The Bok Choy was fresh and tender. The Beef Tenderloin was bursting with flavor from the black pepper marinade. It was a tasty dish.  Dessert concluded our meal with Mochi Ice Cream, Green Tea and Mango were the flavors. I usually enjoy green tea ice cream, but the mango was a strong favorite. It was light with bold refreshing flavor. The Mochi was chewy without being too gummy. When asked how he enjoyed his meal, my brother replied, \"It's fucking weird, but I like it.\" Just like that another foodie is born.   Blossom was a great choice for Restaurant Week, it's not likely a restaurant I would have chosen otherwise. However, it was a nice treat and it left me drooling over their peking duck and dungeness crab on the regular menu.",

    "text": "Great food and awesome service! Blossom drink was superb... beautiful and yummy. I went here for my birthday date and loved the experience!   Flower cocktail was superb and yummy   Fried rice was good too.   Pan fried scallop was delicious, especially with the fresh cut jalapeno side condiment. And there was plenty of scallops on the plate to share.   Had another dish, the tenderloin beef which came with peppered beef and mushroom and this was delicious.   I would come here for a nice dinner after a drink or two.   My only concern is that there is msg in the source used in the dishes.   Overall, great experience and delicious food!",

    "text": "Had dinner at Blossom 2 weeks ago.  It was wonderful Cantonese food.  Place deserves ~4.5 stars, so am rounding up as it is currently at 4 stars.  We started with cocktails.  One was baijiu based, and had a unique taste, while the other was a sweet and fruity one.  Next we had appetizers.  Their Crisp-Fried Eggplant was delicious.  Even better was the Crisp Fried Shrimp on White Toast, served on top of cabbage, with side dishes of mayonnaise and a tangy (tamarind?) sauce.  Almost ordered a second one.  For entrees we had their Crisp-Fried Chilean Sea Bass and Jian Bo Beef.  Chilean Sea Bass is one of my favorite fishes, and they gave a generous portion of fish that was perfectly fried.  Sole critique: this dish needs a bit more flavor, some kind of sauce.  In contrast, the Jian Bo Beef came with a delicious sauce.  Would happily come back next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow, no thanks.  The food here was tasteless.  I tried very hard to convince myself and my table of colleagues that Blossom was aiming for the highly refined palate, and we were to \"experience the essence of ginger\" in our very bland potstickers.  There was hope in the delicious bowls of vegetarian hot and sour soup (although not very hot and very expensive at $10 a bowl -- more like a cup).  After this, our hopes were dashed repeatedly, first with the kung pao chicken that had no \"pao\" in it and second with the crispy sea bass that had large pieces of bone.  One person received a piece with vertebrae and hardly any fish meat to try.  I ordered the tofu and shiitake mushroom dish, which on most accounts tends to be bland to begin with.  I enjoyed this the most; the tofu was high quality and silky, and the mushrooms were fresh.  Unfortunately, my table mates were disappointed even with the hot sauces and chiles they requested on the side.  If you like real authentic Chinese food, you will be disappointed by the lack of flavor and the high prices here.  Service was excellent, though.  And the tea was very good -- similar to what I have had in Taiwan.  It's interesting to note that along with the rest of the ARIA resort, the restaurant is poorly designed.  Everything here is maze-like, with no simple (effective) throughway.  It seems this would be a safety hazard.  What if there was some kind of emergency?  We couldn't figure out how to get out of the restaurant without someone pointing the way, and we were in no hurry.  Further examples of design chosen over function...the automated hand sensor for the faucets in the bathroom is under the sink level and the locks turn the wrong way!",

There are a lot of good/high end chinese restaurants in los angeles and even in Las Vegas China Town. The food are equally good between high end casino chinese restaurants and outside of casino restaurants, but the price for the in casino restaurants are 2-4 times higher. They food are quite authentic, the ambiance/decor, and the service are great, but again, too pricey. If you want chinese food inside the casino, don;t hit the end restaurants, do the more casual restaurants like Red 8 at the Wynn, the Beijing Noodle # 9 at the Caesar, or the Noodle place in Mandalay Bay.",

Booked through open table for 7people and stated I needed a private room cause of their policy of no children under 6 is not allowed in the restaurant unless they are in a private room. I stated that I had a three year old with our party. We get there and they said I needed to spend $1500 minimum to get the private room. The restaurant stated that they called me @ 3:30 to tell me. I never received a phone call or voicemail from them.  Open table has my correct phone number so if you called I would have cancelled my reservation due to the crazy minimum spending of $1500 and booked at another restaurant that serves children. Your receptionists were Very rude and unwilling to fix the situation. I Would never eat here again or recommend any of my friends to this place. Discrimination against kids is a No Bueno for me.  after the fiasco in front of your restaurant, I booked STK at the Cosmopolitan. They accommodated us with no problem with our 3yr old and treated us with kindness. Blossom should learn from this restaurant and others restaurants that don't have that ridiculous children under 6 policy.",

Made a same-day reservation during Halloween weekend as we were staying next door at the Vdara and this restaurant seemed like it had great reviews. We were greeted and escorted to our table right away.  I made note of our special occasion and it was mentioned by the host right when we were seated. We were given a beautiful big booth facing out towards the rest of the restaurant. The waitress came right away to get drink orders and hand over the menu.   We decided to order a few things so we could share them, however we did not expect the portions to be so huge! We order the bbq duck, beef (forgot the name), and garlic prawn fried rice. The speed that the food came was so impressive! Literally within 10 minutes even though the restaurant was some-what busy.   Everything tasted so delicious. I don't eat anything spicy which is why we chose out these dishes. The seasonings were all fantastic! The beef was way better than I expected and same with the fried rice. We had to ask for to-go containers as we had more than half the food left over.  After the meal we were too full for dessert so we asked for the bill. However our sweet waitress knew of the special occasion and presented us with some mochi ice cream as well as a cute little gift box! What a fantastic way to end an already great experience! Will definitely be back.",

I had a ticket to see Zarkana so I went last night and ordered from the early dining menu which is a prix fixe 4 course meal.  I started with the corn egg drop soup.  It was standard fare.  Very tasty and a good starter.  Next came crisp fried beef roll with enoki mushroom and Mandarin brown sauce.  The rolls had a crisp exterior and very good tasting, moist beef inside.  The brown sauce was flavorful.  The main course has a choice option and I went with the beef tenderloin with portabella mushroom.  The beef was coated with black pepper and there was a small amount of black pepper sauce with the meat.  Accompanying the meat were stir fried bok choy and rice.  The meat was so very tender it could almost be cut with a fork only.  For dessert, there were two mochi--red bean and green tea.  Service was superb!  The servers knew I had a 7 PM show.  Since the restaurant opens at 5:30, time is an issue.  The courses were brought out in a timely manner with enough time between so not to feel rushed yet never was I tapping my foot nor looking at my watch.  They know what they're doing!  My server, Kenny, was very polite and pleasant.  The restaurant is quite elegant.  It was relatively quiet with modern music playing at a low, background volume which would be conducive to conversation.  I have to return and order a la carte when I can try some of the very interesting things on the menu.",

    "text": "Delicious Chinese food cooked with quality ingredients inside Aria.  We liked the ambiance and decor, modern with touches of ethnic decor that is not over the top. The service was friendly, attentive and superb.  It was also quiet which allowed us to enjoy our meal and take a break from the crazy casino chatter.  If you had good Chinese food before, your taste buds will be pleased with the similar taste and authentic ingredients.  Your wallet (on the other hand) will not be so pleased if you are used to the typical prices for similar dishes. But hey, you are in LV and living it up.  We recommend the BBQ pork appetizer, the steamed bass and tofu in black been sauce which was light and flavorful, the mustard greens cooked in savory broth, topped with shredded dried scallop...yumm.  The mustard greens can be bitter but it was well balanced with the other ingredients and made a great soup.  The Mongolian beef dish was also cooked just right and complemented by mushrooms and other veggies.  Cocktails were made just right.  The only issue we had was the fancy chopsticks was not comfortable due to its shape and weight distribution!  I am used to the regular bamboo chopsticks!",

My Chinese food experiences are limited to the likes of Panda Express (usually in an airport) or the good ole delivery variety.  Wow, I have really been missing out.  First, I hate how hard of a hit Vegas in general has taken due to the economy, and having the restaurant be less than 25% full on a Saturday night was a sad reminder of the current state of affairs.  But back to Blossom... outstanding service.  Sounds like others have had similar surprise desserts due to a passing mention of a special occasion.  I felt a tad guilty, because it was clear that the waiter misunderstood us... we didn't actually get married that day, we just got our marriage LICENSE that day.  Oh well, we still got a fabulously gorgeous and delicious dessert - for free!  Back to the beginning... I actually can't remember what our appetizers were - we ordered several, and I know they were very tasty, but clearly neither were True standouts.  Several of the entrees we ordered were enormous portions!  My mom ordered the sea bass, and it was notably good.  I had the mongolian beef and it was good enough for me to finish the entire thing (despite being on the standard bridal pre-wedding diet, so that says a lot).  My now-husband had a great entree that I can't remember, but nothing special.  Overall, we had a wonderful time celebrating the procurement of our State of Nevada marriage license at Blossom, and I hope we'll find an occasion to return soon.",

So then I find out we have two more adults coming and ask for a bigger table. They were hesitant but allowed us to seat in the \"VIP\" room.  At first I though nice. Private room. Wrong!  Private room is like a round padded jail cell. Just barely big enough to fit the big table and the chairs around it. Not only that but it was nearly impossible to get any service in that room. I guess VIP stands for very invisible people.  When we finally got a hold of a server and asked for something we would have to wait about 25 mins with no result and have to frantically flag another server.  They got three stars solely because the spicy water fish dish was AMAZING!! So good we ordered two. Yes the second one took forever yet again to flag someone down and ask if we can order from our server.  Also. Server was Korean and did not speak chinese. Now that to me does not make sense. It's a Chinese restaurant. I would like sometimes to order in Chinese. Only because I only sometimes know things in Chinese. Anyhow. I thought that was interesting. But I would ace let it slide if he was nicer and attentive. But neither was the case. The food was pretty outstanding. Peking duck was crispy and tasty. Main complaint is the service. And small VIP room.",

I figured the menu is in Chinese so they can order what they felt was appetizing. Here was the dinner:  Goose liver: Absolutely ahhmaaaazing! It's two slabs of liver that is way too much for one person. I think it would've gone well with a small piece of toast, kind of like a spread. But eating it by itself was delicious too.  Peking Duck: $80?!?!? but i have to say it was the best duck I've ever had. Super juicy and flavorful. You get to have the skin with the buns and then the rest of the duck is cut up afterwards.  Chilean Sea Bass: Pretty small portion but definitely not a dish for one person. The batter was very light and crispy. Bass was juicy and flakey.   Spicy Chicken hot pot: Pass. It was a pretty average dish that I wouldn't pay that much for ever again.  Sausage Fried Rice: We ordered this just to accompany the other dishes. It was pretty pricey for what it is, but at least it wasn't bad.  Beef Chow Mein (crispy): My sister ordered this to compare with another Chinese restaurant she liked in Vegas. She thinks the other place was better. I thought it was pretty good. Very typical but at least the flavors were all there, the beef was tender, and the noodles were crispy and not oily.  The water! Omg GROSS! It kind of ruined the meal for a lot of us. I think if the water was better, I would've enjoyed the meal a little more.  Service was great. The hosts and the waitstaff were all very polite and attentive. The floorplan was simple and I loved the interior. It was Asian but very modern. I would definitely come back but I'd probably choose their more exotic dishes next time.",

It is rare, in fact probably happened for the first time ever yesterday, where I ate at 2 restaurants through out the day and both of them were 5/5 for me (see my other review on Terrace Pointe Cafe). In sum, I was a happy camper!  Blossom - Overall 5/5 Ambience - 5/5 Very elegant Asian/Chinese theme, excellent lighting Service 5/5 Top Notch Food - Went for dinner - 5/5 Yum! Annoyance factors - None  We requested that our food be made a tad spicier and it couldn't have been more perfect. The various chinese sauces, the blends and everything was so perfect. The chicken was cooked to perfection. Favorite dish - Spicy Indian Fried Rice - I know this sounds fairly standard, but the way this was made was just outta this world, never had anything like this  before .. All the waiters were very friendly and accommodating.",

I had it in china and the taste was comparable. If you want to try the Peking duck then you will jot be disappointed!! Maximum flavor.  Mushroom appetizer: there's a mushroom appetizer they make that is really good. Comes out infused with some candy glaze that just takes over the flavor. It's great.  BBQ ribs: perfect. Not overdone or slimy or anything. Color was a deep red, candy like. Just perfect!!   Also I have to add that the service was great. They knew not just how to help us order and suggest items but also they did a great job at controlling the tempo if how the food came out to us. Everything seemed to flow out at a great pace dish after dish and all prepared and ready right when they brought it to us. Nothing we ate had the notion of being under a heat lamp or anything like that. I have to mention his because the amount of dishes we ordered would be challenging even for a experienced waiter to be able to time for us.   Oxtail was great, nice consistency on the sauce. Meat was falling off the bone too,  Spicy chicken was really good. I can't put a finger on the flavor in it but it had an aromatic smell/taste so unique and good I keep thinking about it.  Drinks: the family ordered singapore slings and they were very good. Not too sweet. I ordered Hendricks and tonic and it  was strong with a nice lemon garnish. Prepped nicely.  Chinese dinner was a hit at this one. I'll definitely do it again. I'll order Peking duck, mushroom appetizer and the soup.  The soup: I didn't order it but my mom did. I have I add it's awesome because the simple fact her noodles were literally tied in a knot. It was pretty nice touch. Impressive.",

The beef dish had tons of flavor, lots of sauce, and cooked to perfection. I couldn't stop eating it!   After we stuffed ourselves silly, our waiter gave us a small complimentary tea gift set!

(Those typical oolong tea or flower tea that chinese restaurants usually offer for free)  Also, they will charge u $10 for a small cup of soup for EACH  person in the party.   These things are just fine as long as they let customer know when placing order but they don't even mention it, which I felt was unfair",

    "text": "My wife and a number of friends were in town for CES this year and decided to go to dinner at Blossom after getting drinks at Minus 5 in Monte Carlo.  I had never been in the Aria, so seeing the beautiful hotel for the first time was great.  There were 10 or so of us dining together at a table, so it was family style dining where each person ordered something and everyone shared.  Here are some of the items that we ordered:  Pot Stickers - Tender and tasty. Standard potstickers.  Egg Rolls - Standard.  Toasty when fresh.  BBQ Pork - Tender and well flavored.  Kung Pao Chicken and Shrimp - Tasty, spicy, excellent quality.  Pan Fried Beef Tenderloin - Really liked this one.  Great texture and flavor.  Beef Broccoli - Standard and tasty.  Two types of broccoli for options.  Hong Kong Style Chow Mein with seafood - This was great and went fast.  Lots of variety and nice textures of crispy noodles.  Some other type of Chow Mein - Also good.  Not pan fried noodles though.  Good sauce.  An interesting note, there is a $44K bottle of wine listed on their wine menu (it's a 1990 vintage I believe).  Hard to justify that, but it was the first time seeing that before.  Summary: Food was very good as far as flavors and quality goes.  The service was impeccable.  Very attentive and efficient with ensuring everyone had drinks, food, etc. whenever needed.  The only qualm I have with this place is the price.  It is an upscale Chinese restaurant, and definitely elegant inside, but $30 for beef and broccoli... One can't honestly say that it's worth that much.  So it wasn't.  The dinner was too expensive to warrant it a \"good deal,\" but it was still a nice dinner and good for a large group.",

It kind of opened my eyes to how good tea can be.  We ordered the half BBQ duck, Chinese sausage fried rice, Kung Pao chicken and a shredded pork dish. The BBQ duck was delicious, by far my favorite item.  The shredded pork with vegetables was also good, but the fried rice was just ok - nothing special.  I didn't try the Kung Pao but was told it was very good.  They have a lot of specialty seafood dishes as well that cost upwards of $100. Next time if I win big at the casino I might try them! Definitely worth a dinner here in any case.",

Waiters and guest are most definitely at the top of their etiquette. Table setting was decent to me and their menu look beautiful. However, when opening their menus, I was blown away that their menu wasn't entirely expensive. Yes, they do have dishes that cost between $50-$200, but they also have a wide variety of dishes between $10-$40. I went to this restaurant with a few other people and we decided to eat family style. We ordered a bunch of rice dishes like Walnut Prawns, Clams, Bok Choy, Choy Sum, Seabass, Duck, Beef Tendon, Duck Tongue, and Fried Rice. I had to say though, the presentation of the dishes was not all that great. They seemed to just placed the food on the plates and bring them out to the table. Plus, they did not clean the plates before serving.....what kind of high end restaurant doesn't clean their plates?!? The portions were small, but it was expected. Now the food, it didn't have the flavors that stuck out to me, in fact, a lot of dishes tasted bland to me. The only dish I actually enjoyed was the duck, I was actually surprised that this dish wish tasty and the texture was just right. Overall, if I am going to pay hundreds of dollars to eat an expensive restaurant, I'm going to need more than a fancy setting, I want my food to actually look and taste good. Don't think I'll ever come back. (But it's not like casinos care if you come back cause they continuously have customers year-round....just saying)",

We started with the shrimp/scallop/won ton soup (yum!), then we each received an appetizer plate that had a beef roll (like an egg roll, but better), a dumpling (pork and not too oniony) and some fried eggplant (tempura batter).  All of this was great and the husband even ate the vegetables!  Main courses were crispy fried sea bass, a delicious prime sirloin, baby bok choy and combination fried rice which was some of the best fried rice I have ever had.  Husband got a bottle of sake and I went with an Albarino.  Dessert was the usual mochi icre cream which I don't like no matter who is serving, so that is the one star off.

The subtle hint of salt on the fried eggplant just pushed it over the top and the pork dumplings were elegant and not at all like typical dumplings.   Following that was the hot and sour soup which was served elegantly and tasted spectacularly. The flavors were all there and the spices didn't over power the soup.   The main course was the Peking duck which was cooked perfectly and sliced table side. The chef then took the remaining parts of the duck to the back and cut it up as a second dish which included the legs, wings and the rest. It was fully delicious and served with care.   The staff is also to be complimented as they were attentive, courteous, and ensured there wasn't ever a time we had to look for them to get something. The whole meal and experience were splendid!

The service impeccable and the food AMAZING! The martinis were perfectly blended and we were never rushed to order and instead given time to enjoy drinks and conversation. They brought us a complimentary appetizer of beef cheek that was yum! Ordered the crispy eggplant and goose liver (foi gras) and both were great! For the main course we went with the bbq duck, beef chow fun and a yang chow fried rice. We eat a lot of Chinese food and 90% of the food we eat while on our stays in Las Vegas is Asian food. This by far was the best Chinese food we have eaten in many years. It was a full dining experience not to be missed in Vegas...",

The Peking duck was a must as the waiter brought the duck to the table and prepared the meal. The fried rice and vegetable dishes were good and very flavorful just wish it was a little Bigger in portions for the price we pay. Service was very attentive and welcoming!",

It is not on the menu, but they will make it if you know to ask for it. Boneless Chilean sea bass is cut into manageable pieces and cooked with Szechuan pepper and red chili-rich oily broth . The heat is quite intense and wonderful, a level that the kitchen will not lessen. If you don't absolutely love massive amounts of capsaicin in your food, do not even consider ordering this. One bowl can feed a hungry couple or possibly 4 people depending on how many sides you order. I  always get fried rice and some vegetables.  This restaurant has been at Aria since the hotel opened, so they are doing a lot of things right. I can't speak to any of the nearly hundred other entrees, though; the ma la fish won't let me get anything else.",

The presentation was impressive and the food was delicious. I rarely crave Chinese food, but this restaurant will probably make me have Chinese food more often.

    "text": "When good luck brings great fortunes then feeding that luck feeds the fortune.  So explains my Macao poker / gambling bud.  Fortune cookie aside, the philosophy makes for incredible meals.  VERY IMPORTANT:  The use of fresh, high quality ingredients, expertly prepared, great ambiance and service, and the ever present Chinese fortune building philosophy results in a luxurious meal at high prices.  Expect dinner for two to top $500.  Tip: Ask for the Luxury menu (features shark fin, birds nest, and abalone dishes) and the \"secret\" menu of chef's specialties (extremely authentic and rewarding dishes).  Tip:  Try the prefix meal with wine pairing if it's your first visit.  Good selection of more familiar dishes.  The pairing of Chinese food with Western wines is eye opening.  From the regular menu, do not pass on the foie.  Brushed with  a black pepper sauce then flashed fried.  The powerful black pepper sauce adds a punch that brings out the natural sweetness of the foie while the earthy grip keeps the richness in check.  Impressive.  The giant clam (geoduck) is outstanding.  OK it's $200 but try it and you'll understand why the Chinese are crazy for this candy of the sea.  Prepared two ways, the foot, makes for incredible sashimi.  Sweet, toothsome, clean oceanic finish.  The mantel is fried with a delicate crispness and aggressive seasoning.  Still tender but with a more pronounced oceanic finish and heightened sweetness.    Santa Barbara spot prawns in salted pepper is outstanding.  Just cooked through.  Incredible texture and sweetness.  The head fat, creamy goodness.  The same, simply steamed with a sweetened with garlic, outstanding.  Pungent yet oh so juicy.  The head fat, suckably delicious liquid crack.    The Dungeness and  Australian crystal crab (aka Snow Crab) are both excellent.  The first benefits from a stronger black bean sauce, while the second's sweetness and delicacy is heightened by the ginger and scallion sauce.   The only faux pas, the Peking duck.  Carved table side. Beautifully presented but not True Peking duck.  More like carved duck breast served in bun or on lettuce.  Juicy and delicious for sure but not the ethereal, crispy skin only that practically melts on the tongue.    Finally, from the special menu, the bird nest soup is incredible.  High quality nest, the filaments are nearly white and translucent.  The texture and flavor are unique.  Not unpleasant but very different.  Something that must be experienced.    Service is excellent.  Good wine list but more impressive is the amazing pairing possibilities.  Definitely use the sommelier.  Pairings with this food far surpass the usual Riesling.  A worthy choice for anyone wanting to experience great Chinese cuisine.  Who knows, It may just bring you good luck and great fortune.",

From the decor to the utensils, Blossom really is top notch.   We had a little of everything to make the most of our first time. Besides the wine and the Fiji water, we had the Peking duck, full live cod, xo green beans, wonton and hot and sour soup. To begin, the soups were both fantastic. While the hot and sour was more traditional, the wonton was a full ensemble with enoki mushroom, scallops, and large wontons - delicious. The Peking duck was fantastic. The skin melt in your mouth good and the buns sticky and fresh. The wrap portion of the Peking duck was tasty. But the actual cooked duck served as part of the main meal was something else entirely. Fantastic meat and cooked through perfectly. The live cod was the standout of the meal though. Served full, bone in, with bok choy and tofu on the side of the dish, the dish was beautiful to say the least. The fish was chewy but the braised sauce really tasted fantastic, especially coupled with some of the truly spicy complimentary sauces. The dish was great with tasty vegetables and tofu, easily 10x better than the xo green beans ordered as an extra.   The meal will surely set you back. But it will also fill you up so you definitely get out of there under $100 per person if you order the right dishes and go for the lower prices alcohol. Aria once again does not disappoint with their restaurants.",

Blossom is cute, it reminds me of those Chinese soap operas where a kung fu fight is about to break out at. HAHA.  We made reservations and was seated right away, they were not packed but there was a good amount of people.    The food had great presentation.  We tried: - Lettuce Wrap - Spicy Indian-Style Fried Rice - Walnut Prawns - Beef Tenderloin with Portabella Mushrooms - Lychee Creme Brulee  The food was delicious.  It is definately more tasty than most traditional chinese restaurants.  It is pricier than the traditional places but it is actually slightly cheaper than fancy American joints.   Next time we will try the Peking Duck.  You get a whole duck and they slice it in front of you.  We really wanted to get it but one whole duck is too much for just the two of us.  We were stuffed after our main dishes but wanted to try the dessert, it sounded tempting.  Boy were we glad we got it! The LYCHEE Creme Bruless is to die for! DELICIOUS!   Our server was nice and helpful.  He also joked with us about traditional chinese restaurants.  We asked for sliced oranges and fortune cookies at the end to joke about. :]",

That's how you do mushrooms; they had the most incredible flavour and meatiness. I'm still thinking about them. I also got the tempura string beans and they were a little lacking in flavour but they made up for it in crunch and the dipping sauce fixed the lack of flavour. My entree was the chow fun with vegetables and it was perfect. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the vegetables were cooked but still had some crunch and the flavour was simply perfect. Also, the service was amazing, water and tea consistently topped up, dirty plates removed immediately, we were checked on after each plate dropped. I can't say enough good things about my experience here. It was pretty much perfect!",

    "text": "Ive been here twice now - once with just my wife, and once with my whole family. Both were good experiences. Ambience is nice, upscale, classy - but not pretentious. Menu has a good selection of standard chinese fare, and plenty of seafood options. The service is attentive and courteous. The food is of good quality, as you would expect for the price you pay. My only gripe is that I wish there was a bit more quantity in each entree for the price. But otherwise, its a great place to try if you feel like Chinese in a relaxed, cozy atmosphere.  Oh yeah, the Jasmine Tea, Hot and Sour Soup, and Lychee Martinis are great!",

And you know how you hardly ever get a \"how was the food?/ is there anything else you need?\" or get any attention when you're at a Chinese restaurant, well, you won't get that here.  You'll get all the attention you need.  Their BBQ pork ribs are a mouth watering dish, full of flavor and just cooked enough to be tender and not falling off the bone.  Fried Chilean Sea Bass was terrific.  Very expesive place though, I guess it comes with the territory.  So expect to put out at least $100 for party of 2.  Would come back here any day if I have the money for it.",

    "text": "We reserved the large private dining room for a group of 19 for our wedding reception. The reservation was done through Aria group dining, but they worked with the chef to customize our menu. There were too many items to go into detail about each one, but overall they were excellent. I especially recommend the goose liver and lobster. Quality of food would be a 5/5, although the crispy sea bass was one item that was somewhat disappointing. Portions were huge, way more than our group could manage to finish.  I had a couple of minor drink-related gripes. First, they didn't tell us what the price would be for the Fiji water they were pouring. They would end up charging us for 11 bottles of water at $9 each, so as a group we were charged over $120 for water after tax and gratuity! If we had known it would be that much, we would have asked for regular tap water. Second, we ordered 2 bottles of wine - one for each table that our group was seated at. Once the 2 bottles were done, they automatically opened 2 more and started pouring - even though everyone had already had enough wine. So that's another extra $140+ that we ended up paying. I really don't like to feel like I got price-gouged when the menu is finalized beforehand, so Blossom gets 4 stars instead of 5.",

    "text": "Since we were staying at the Aria for our anniversary and this was our first stay I relied on the concierge to help me plan our trip.  She suggested Blossom for our anniversary dinner and I am very happy I followed her advice.  We had early dinner reservations, we wanted to have our evening free.  We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation.  I was a little concerned with our initial contact to this restaurant.  The hostess at the desk was busy on the phone and pretended we were not standing in front of her.  Not even an acknowledging smile.  When she completed her phone call, there was no apology or acknowledgment of our wait.  She (with tone) asked if she could help.  Hubby told her we had reservations and she looked incredulous.  I looked down at our clothing, is it maybe we were under dressed and this was giving her cause?  But no, we were dressed in business casual and when we entered the restaurant realized even better dressed than most of the clientele.    En route to our table she did wish us a happy anniversary and told us that they had reserved a special table for us.  No smile though.  We were escorted and seated at a beautiful, romantic booth.  We were set away from everyone but yet had a complete view of the restaurant.  It was perfect.  Once sour face left our table, the service went up 100%  We were greeted by smiling face after smiling face.  The menu had some common Chinese dishes and many we had never seen or heard of before.  We made a decision to not choose our normal and try something new.  Drinks - Hubby went for a traditional Dirty Martini, I went off the menu and asked if they could make me a Lychee Martini, the immediate response was OF COURSE we can.  LOVE the enthusiasm and the excellent martini I ended up with.  We chose the Tempura Fried Ice Fish as our starter. They are small fish that are fried whole (this means heads on people).  Hubby is from Ghana and I am from Greece, we both have similar fish dishes from our prospective countries that we love.  These fish were AMAZING.  They were fresh, light, crispy and very tasty.  We will be going back for this appetizer if nothing else, again and again.  For our main courses (we over ordered) we ordered the Szechuan Shrimp, Spicy Wok-Fried Scallion Veal Cheek (OMG), Fried Chilean Sea Bass and the Yang Chow Fried Rice.  The Veal Cheeks are out of this world delicious and they mean the spicy part.  My mouth definitely felt the aftermath of the spice..  Definitely my favorite dish this night.  The Szechuan Shrimp was delicious and perfectly prepared, it is just the right amount of spice and is in a broth that is excellent over rice.  The fried rice was a little bland for me, but the pork within the rice was delicious.  The least favorite, and we both only took a bite of, was the sea bass.  That one was very disappointing.  Too greasy, very fishy and not too much flavor to it.  The service here is impeccable (with the exception of the hostess) and the romantic setting makes for a wonderful dinner experience.  This is a restaurant that you can come too and have a nice conversation with your meal, and not have to yell over noise to get heard.  Definitely adding this restaurant to our list of places to come back too.",

Service = at least 10 individuals at your table welcoming, clearing, suggesting, and doting. Signature cocktails on an iPad- Great Wall with Ginger Beer was delicious. Food - only the two us- ordered perfectly. Egg Rolls (different- they had a noodle inside- you get 4) Garlic Shrimp Fried Rice (JUMBO shrimp) Jian Bo Beef (go for it, blows Mongolian away) Chicken Chow Mein was hearty.  We ordered conservatively, 2 signature cocktails and got out of there less than $120 without tip. Well worth it for the dining experience.  When they dropped check, got mochi cookies, a Blossom gift of dry tea and pineapple cake plus hot towels!",

A decent selection with fair prices.  We ordered a bottle of Whitehall Lane Cabs.  (One of my favorite wineries in Napa.)  Markup on this bottle was not bad for a Vegas restaurant!  There was 5 of us and we shared the food family style.   Potstickers - I didn't try these but everyone at the table really liked them.  Chicken Lettuce wraps - pretty good.... didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for.  I added some of their house hot sauce to spruce it up!  Shiitake Mushrooms - WOW!  These were amazing.  These meaty mushrooms were fried to perfection and then sauteed in a delish sauce!!!  This is was the table favorite for the appetizers.  Chicken Chow Mein - Standard.  I liked that it wasn't too oily!  Spicy Indian-style Fried Rice - I LOVE CURRY so this was amazing!  Perfect heat too!  Ma Po Tofu - I have an emotional tie to this dish...  the tofu had the perfect texture and the sauce was delicious and spicy!  (The portion of this dish was HUGE!  basically this is only thing that didn't get finished at the table.)  Spicy Chicken Hot Pot - I did not try this but was told this was good.  Beef Tenderloin with Portabella Mushrooms - The table ordered this cooked medium rare.  I didn't try this either, but this was the rest of the table's favorite main dish.  They raved about how perfectly the meat was cooked and how amazing the sauce was.   There were so many other items on the menu we wanted to try so I cannot wait to come back here and try some more new dishes as well as reorder some of our favorites!",

    "text": "My boyfriend, his family and I stayed at the Aria hotel (not in the same room, obviously) recently and Blossom turned out to be our go-to restaurant when we were hungry.   They had a special dim sum lunch menu special for the Chinese New Year, and that won us over. I was able to share my (minuscule) knowledge of authentic Chinese street food with my guy that I gained while in China. He was open to trying the chicken feet and ox tripe (which were both excellent, it brought back memories). We ate here three times during our five night stay.  My boyfriend went crazy for the Giant Clam (at $200+, it's far from cheap). I enjoyed it as well, but would only recommend it if you're a fan of clam to begin with. We had the Giant Clam sashimi-style and the \"head\" (we're still not quite sure what it was) of the clam came to our table later, deep fried with salt & pepper. It was very tasty as well.   The Peking duck is both beautiful and delicious, however it is only available for dinner. The only thing I found peculiar was that they didn't make duck bone soup with the bones (it's traditionally served after the meal), but I overlooked that.  If you're in the mood for some really excellent Chinese food on the Strip, check out Aria's Blossom.",

    "text": "I was a bit skeptical when I found out about this place at Aria.  Given the experience with Chinese places inside a hotel on the Strip tended to be an expensive mediocre food quality meal.  When we arrived, there was not anybody at the reception for some reasons, minutes later somebody showed up and seated us at our table.  The decor matched the level Aria has with a darker theme like many fine dining restaurants.  First impression we got was our waitress really talk down on us based on our familiarity with their menu.  Not off to a great start.  We got some BBQ Back Ribs and BBQ Pork (Char Siu) for starter.  The ribs tasted decent, the meat was tender and it leaves a teeth mark after biting onto it.  The char siu was ok, even though they used a more expensive area of the pig, but the food color usage sets the quality back.   They have luxurious items like shark fin, bird's nest, and abalone here as well.  For main course, we had Braised Bai Ling Mushroom with Baby Bok Choy.  It was a bit disappointing, they did not cook the mushroom long enough, which made it taste like can mushroom.  Foo Jian-style Fried Rice was tasty, probably the best dish among what we ordered for the night, there was a nice balance between the sauce and fried rice.  In comparison with, Egg White & Dried Scallop Fried Rice, which was decent, but just not as good as the Foo Jian rice.  Pan Fried Fish Patty with Daikon was ok.  Spicy Chicken had an overwhelming flavor in it, almost felt like a bit too much.  Salt & Pepper Fried Tofu was a bit uneven seasoned.  I have mixed feeling about their service, on one end, we got an odd waitress with rude attitude and she took forever to get the bill right at the end.  On the other end, we have great supporting service with our plates getting swap for clean one after each dinner phase and there was a floor manager figure making service was up to par.  They all still had that poker face though.  Blossom has potential to become the best Chinese restaurant in town, I am still not convinced yet, perhaps I am judging them harsher being a fine dining place.  Some elements are still missing here.  Price was actually not too expensive compared to some of the place I visited in Vegas.",

    "text": "Very nice modern style Chinese restaurant. Food quality is above average although can be a little greasy (primarily speaking about the fried rice). Although this is a hit or miss, as the last time I was here, it was perfect. I am Chinese and have eaten my fair share of Chinese food so I know what is good. I have tasted better Chinese food in Canada, and this no where compares to the authenticity of the food in China. But overall, it is decently high quality with good service. You pay a premium to eat in the hotel, but you get a nice atmosphere.   Nonetheless it can be fairly affordable--we paid around $120 for a dinner for two after tax and tip. Fried sea bass for $38, lettuce vegetable wrap $16, OX spicy fried rice $32. That's the prices off the top of my head. Could be worse considering the sky is the limit for high end Vegas food. Portion is good and is a convenient eat for those staying here. Primarily eat here because was comped credits.  Note: they offer if you want to take pictures. Probably don't want that. We did that once as a group, had two pictures and it was probably $50 or $100 for the pictures. They don't tell you the price. Don't get shocked, nothing is free in Vegas",

Compared to the decor and ambience,  the price is really reasonable.  For Chinese restaurant, service is excellent. They check on your table promptly. If you order wine, manage will go to your table and refill wine for you frequently. Food are exceptional. My favorite dishes are Dungeness crab and egg white fried rice. I can't wait to come back for dinner on my next Vegas trip.",

I always sit in a comfy booth.    One of my favorite restaurants in the country for a full Peking Duck ($89) that can feed three or four honestly.  You get either the sticky buns or wraps, but I ask for a combination of both because the sticky buns are so filling.  I love sharing the presentation w/ friends & family new to Blossom because they wheel out this beautiful duck w/ all the fixings & carve it out into the buns & the wraps w/ cucumber, scallions & hoisen sauce.  Mmm delish!    For starters, the Shimp & Vegetable lettuce wraps are a tasty & lite start.  A fantastic specialty cocktail & wine list.  At the end of your meal they bring Lucky Sesame Cookies & a box of green tea & a pineapple cookie.    The calm, peaceful atmosphere & silver flowered wallpaper is gorgeous!  The bathrooms are always clean also.",

We order and within 20-30 it's been freshly roasted to order and then a 2 person service team carves/slices and then perfectly assembles your meal (we choose the buns vs spring rolls). Second course of duck can be fried rice or they have a variety of creative options to explore. Restaurant is beyond gorgeous and seating is romantic and comfortable. Service is ultra fine dining and everyone is working in sync to ensure the best dining experience possible. We adore this place! Daniel was our server and he was wonderful. Thank you, Daniel for a great time!",

I really liked the spicy sauces brought out on the side. Loved the soy sauce with all the peppers in it. Ordered jasmine tea and it was so good. I drank a lot of tea. For dishes I got the walnut shrimp and the spicy chicken hot pot. Both was very delicious. Loved everything about the dishes. It was well put together in taste and presentation. I liked the fruits (melons) that came with the walnut shrimp. The shrimps were big and flavorful. The spicy chicken hot pot sauce was so good! I liked the green vegetable they put in it, it gave a lot of flavor! I loved the mushrooms with the spicy chicken. Chicken was moist and good. There are some small bones so just be careful eating it. We were so full afterwards we had no room for dessert. Definitely enjoyed my experience here.",

I was almost certain he was just pushing one of their restaurants, but I'm glad I did not give into my paranoia as this was the best Chinese meal I have had in my life. As someone who has eaten a lot of Chinese food (across the entire spectrum of qualities), I can confidently say this.  Atmosphere: phenomenal  Service: also phenomenal - our waitress was extremely helpful in helping us order, it was as if she was as determined to pick exactly the right items as us. She recommended exactly the right amount of food and despite the numerous land mines on the menu (which I define as exceptionally expensive items inconspicuously hidden amongst normal priced items), she focused solely on what was relatively normally priced.  Cocktails: These were very good. Not mind blowing but in the top 20% of restaurant cocktails I've had.  Food: Most important item hit it out of the park. Despite eating a lot of it, I did not feel sick whatsoever afterwords. Most items were very common orders at a Chinese restaurant but very clean and high quality. I split with my friend the pork appetizer, pork dumplings, kung pao chicken, and some side I can't remember. I would describe the food as similar to Mr. Chow but better.",

I have dined here twice and both times received EXCELLENT service and OUTSTANDING dishes!    My second time here I treated a few casino hosts to dinner that have never been here and even they were impressed!  The decor is ultra modern, very comfortable, and spacious.  From the moment you sit down, the great service begins from Blossom's friendly and courteous staff.  You will NEVER need to flag anyone down, they are aware of your every move and will anticipate your every need before you have to ask, thus allowing you to enjoy your meal, drinks, and company to perfection!    THE FOOD: There are many great dishes here, and truth be told I don't believe you will ever have a bad meal here.  For starters I would recommend the Egg Rolls with Bell Pepper, Pot Stickers (Pork), BBQ Back Ribs, and their Hot and Sour Soup!  Any and all of these will be sure to please any taste palate and prepare you for amazing main courses to come.  For main courses, you can again, order many dishes that are large enough to share family style.  The Peeking Duck may be a bit pricey, but it is very good and served in wraps (A bit different than the norm, but VERY good)  I also recommend the Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken, and Beef Tenderloin in Black Pepper Sauce.  All are excellent dishes!    THE BOTTOM LINE: Blossom is at the TOP of my list for Chinese dining while in Las Vegas, this place is consistently EXCELLENT in both food and customer service!  The ambiance is both inviting and comfortable, and allows you to hold conversations among your party at a reasonable level without having to shout.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "This was our first restaurant when we arrived in Aria. We were so hungry we didn't put our bags up to our room.   Chilies (see pic) = $6.50 Beef Chow Fun = $22 Indian Fried Rice = $18 Large Prawn in Mayo with cashew = $24 Jasmine tea = $5.50/ person  Total $120 for three people  If you go online you'll find their menu but no price. Why? Because they're cool like that. No, it's because they want you to come in based on the restaurant decor and let the premium price of beef chow fun slided. It worked on us, or maybe we were butt hungry and don't want to be walking around looking for food.  All three dishes were really good. The flavoring were spot on. It wasn't too salty or too bland. Surprisingly this has been an issue with some of the restaurants I've visited. \"Sage\" which is considered one of the top restaurants in Aria, their food were way too salty. See Sage review when I get to it.  Skip to recap, this is a funny incident. So we waited for a friend who lives in LV. When he got to our table the first thing he said, aloud was, \"I'm so fucking plaster drunk!\" He sat down take a drink of the tea, \"Fuck this is good. Hey waiter get me a bottle!\" Mind you we never met this guy. Then he waved the waiter over and asked if he can smoked a cigarette, \"No sir, there's no smoking in here.\" \"Ok, no problem.\" The waiter walked a way and guess what he did. Yeap, he lit a cigarette. A second later a manager ran over asked him to put it out he said, \"Ok, ok\" and pursue to sucking on the cigarette repeatedly until there weren't anymore then he putted it out. Hilarious.   I left out something. He offered me a cigarette. I don't smoke don't like smoke but I was done with the food and I like humor and I'm curious. So let's see what would happened. So he and I lit a cigarette. That was fun. I'm sure nobody enjoyed that experience except us. What? I didn't say I'm an angel.  Recaps: Food flavor spot on Beautiful restaurant decor Excellent service Jasmine tea here is the bomb. They probably grab this from heaven. Best jasmine tea I've tasted now that I think about it.  Pricing is not heaven send, it's -- wait for it... legendary!!! I'm trying to say that it was very expensive. Beef chow fun for $22?! Where I come from Sam Woo bust that out for $3.99 yo! and the tea was free. But then again your in LV can't do apple to apple comparison. The food were clean and elegant. You can tell the chef/cook got skills. It's not sloppy it's well put together, well timed, well flavors. Well I noticed these things anyway - yeap I was trained and look where it got me, middle of no where. Sorry off topic.   I would go back delicious Chinese food. We left a big tip for being an ass. I'm sure we're forgiven. Heck, they even welcome us back tomorrow.",

    "text": "This is the type of smart restaurant establishments thats opened up in Vegas for all the high roller Asians thatve come from Asia or locally that are sick of going to Chinatown to get their Chinese food fix. Its also a beautiful, sophisticated ambiance, great for impressing a group of Business clients or date night. The food was pretty good, but the ambiance made up for it.  The best was the Garlic Prawn fried rice. Im always impressed when fancy restaurants could make a simple dish taste so unique and enjoyable without packing on the salt.  I had also asked for a side of XO spicy sauce that i noticed they had on the lobster fried rice. This sauce is AMAZING as a spicy kick to your dishes, or for me, just devoured that plate as a side dish. Theyve made this in-house with dried shrimp and scallop. I will warn you though (since the waitor didnt), that they will charge you 6$ for this. But i found it well worth it if youre a Spicy/Seafood lover like me.  The next best thing thats a must is their \"Steamed Seabass & Tofu\". That fish tasted like pure butter, melted right in my mouth, atop the soft tofu, finished with thin slices of scallion, spices & black bean sauce.  The other dishes we ordered that were pretty good, but not \"MUSTS\" were the Beef tenderloin with portabella mushrooms (quality beef, but too salty), pan-fried beef with sweet ginger & pineapple and kungpao chicken.  Id highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "What were we thinking?  The combination of food we ordered just didn't work.  Peking Duck-Choice of buns or pancakes.  Go with the pancakes.  We asked to try both.  The buns are good, but the thin pancakes definitely allow the flavors to come through.  My wife liked the cucumber and scallions, but I could have done without the cucumber.  It detracted from the dish.  The duck was good and presentation and service was excellent, but I have had a crispier skinned duck at a better price here in Hawai'i.  Crispy Chilean Sea Bass-Thick, crunchy crust. This dish lacked presentation and its textures were not complementary.  Two steaks leaning on a mound of shredded daikon. The crust was hard to break through. I marveled at its crunchiness, and the wife thought it was gummy.  Flavors were good, soy sauce, peanut oil?, and scallions. However, the delicate, fresh fish was not allowed to shine because of that thick crust which was also quite oily.  Yang Chow Fried Rice-Char siu (pork) and shrimp.  Typical, but the shrimp was abundant and cooked perfectly...and a little oily.    Pea shoots-Sauteed with garlic.  There was a lot of garlic...a whole lot, but it was good....  Food service was very good.  Water service was poor.   On our part, food selection could have been better.  We left the restaurant feeling like we had just eaten at a greasy spoon.  The duck we expected to be fatty, but everything we ordered seemed to be oily.  Considering the price point, I expected better.  This is a decent restaurant that uses quality ingredients.  Some dishes are a little off the mark and in the wrong combination, can make the meal a fail.",

    "text": "Great service and incredible food!  We wound up here for a business dinner without a reservation and were really surprised that this place wasn't packed.    Our entire party was pleased with the quality of food we got.  We started with the tempura ice fish and the beef roll with enoki mushroom.  Both were spectacular (although how can a pile of little fried fish be anything but?).  Everyone ordered their own entree and didn't really share, but for me, the steamed sea bass on tofu was a great follow up to the heavier appetizers.  The sauce sufficiently allowed the sea bass to shine through.  The fish itself was perfectly flaky.  The tofu added more substance to the dish while not making it heavy.  Can't think of any way to improve this one!    The service was also impeccable.  We were never waiting for drinks and the waiter was always right there if we had a question or wanted to order something.  Even though he was very attentive, he didn't hover.    All in all, a great experience and a pleasant surprise.  If you are looking for some authentic Chinese food and don't want to venture off the strip, add Blossom to your list of options.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "All the Yelp reviews led me here to Blossom. My partner and I were celebrating our 3.5 year anniversary, so we wanted to splurge and find a place with good eats. Everyone had something positive to say here and so we decided to check it out. We made a last minute reservation and thus, seating and dining was quite effortless from there.   This restaurant business is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of drunks and gamblers (aka away from the slot machines and card tables). You'll know you're going the right way when you see the golden statue/fountain right out front.  We were a little hesitant to get Chinese food in Vegas, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the meals at the ARIA so we decided this place had to be just as good. And we were RIGHT.  Our meal consisted of: - the Walnut Prawns - the Beef Chow Fun - Stuffed Crabcakes/Meatballs (I think) - a vegetable dish  It's been awhile since I was there so it's kind of hard for me to remember all of the details. But the Walnut Praws were my favorite part of the dinner. They were so large and succulent, my tastebuds were watering. The Crabcakes/Meatballs were very thick, but the sweet and sour sauce they added made it a lot easier to eat, and enjoyable too.  The hostess and our waiter were all excellent. They provided us with water all the time, asked us if we were okay or if we needed anything else, and so kindly wrapped our leftovers so we could take it back to the hotel room.  I'd definitely recommend this place if you want upscale Chinese food. The pricing of each dish here is rather on the more expensive side of Chinese cuisine. Expect to pay between $20-30 for each entree you decide to get. Sharing it family style makes it a lot more manageable and tastier too!  I hope you enjoy this place as much as I did!",

I really enjoyed the Kung Pao shrimp, as the prawns were huge and flavorful. Just watch for those dried red peppers.   I also enjoyed the Spicy on Spicy pork dish.

Immediately after I was seated he presented me with a perfect long stemmed red rose for Valentine's Day.  That was a very nice surprise, but not the reason for my review.  Jackson was simply one of the nicest servers I have ever encountered.   We asked what kind of hot tea they had and after naming three types we weren't sure if we wanted Oolong or Jasmine.  We expressed to Jackson that we thought it was Oolong that we liked and ordered a pot.  After he poured our tea and we both tasted it he inquired how we liked it.  I said it was okay, but I really think I prefer Jasmine.  Without our prompting he immediately went to the kitchen and procured a piping hot order of Jasmine tea and gave each of us new teacups.  Now Dennis has two teacups in front of him and when he went to pour the second cup of Oolong tea for himself he learned just how hot that pot was and spilled the tea in the process.  Jackson and another server immediately appeared to clean up the mess.  Dennis ordered potstickers as an appetizer and asked for and received five different sauces to complement them, including a small vial of red wine vinegar.  Dennis did not know to hold on to the top when pouring the vinegar.  You guessed it, the top came off and red wine vinegar was splattered all down the front of his shirt in a curious polka dot pattern.  This time three servers rushed to our rescue.  Jackson left and promptly returned with a glass of club soda and small cloth so we could attempt to clean up his shirt, to no avail.  Now I am probably one of the pickiest eaters in the country.  I hate all vegetables (except potatoes if you consider that a vegetable), only eat a couple of fruits, and don't like anything spicy.  Even black pepper is too much for my sensitive palate.  You know how they say your taste buds change every seven years?  Well mine are still stuck at age seven!  I ordered the Wor Wonton Soup without any vegetables because Jackson said it wouldn't be a problem and I did receive it sans vegetables.  I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp without the fruit and it also was presented the way I ordered it.  Everything we asked for we promptly received from a smiling Jackson who was not even slightly fazed by my weird ordering style or Dennis' mishaps.  Blossom's management should know what a gem they have in Jackson.  He was efficient, courteous and friendly and Dennis and I will request him the next time we dine there, and I highly recommend you do the same.   By the way, the food was also excellent and deserves this five-star rating.",

Our server was incredibly helpful and welcoming. He was clearly invested in us enjoying every aspect of our experience in the restaurant, and there were ample support staff to make it a flawless experience. It was pretty formal, but I still felt like I was being cared for as if I were in someones home. We got some great vegetable dishes to share and my boyfriend got a noodle dish as well. Everything we got was delicious. The portions weren't gigantic for the price, but everything was so good that we'd definitely go back. The atmosphere is pretty spectacular, too.   Going to Blossom was one of our favorite aspects of our trip to Vegas.",

We asked if they had rectangle or square table they said no.  They did have a private room to fit 13 people and the minimum was over $2,000.  They waived the minimum, which was nice, but even in the private room, we sat at two round tables, separate.  We ordered separately, the food didn't come out at the same time, the drinks didn't come out of the same time, etc.  The food was good.  I guess it's not good for big groups.",

Seemingly a cuisine underappreciated by many Americans, or at least most frequently enjoyed 'on the cheap,' yet one whose bold flavors I'd previously seen brought to new light by exemplary ingredients in both Toronto and New York it was just after 7:30pm when my friend and I arrived for dinner and seated at a plush two-top given full vantage of the room's center dining area it was with stellar service from a team of at least a half dozen that the night progressed; a cocktail, quartet of savories, and a single dessert plus complimentary cookies served in three courses with every plate stunning in quality, quantity, and presentation.  Starting off with a duo of creamy True/goose foie gras with pronounced sapor balanced by light pepper and seared caramelization served alongside four \"medallions\" melding concepts of Crab Rangoon and Shrimp Toast it would be difficult to name another spot in the States to find a better version of either, yet progressing to the 'main course' it was soon that round one disappeared to the ages as Chef Chi Kwun Choi's farm raised Peking Duck arrived tableside to be deftly carved and plated by a veteran service team claiming to have performed the ritual \"at least two thousand times,\" the crisp and meaty skin placed delicately on bao and in pancakes with crisp vegetable and aromatic hoisin before the rest of the bird was taken to the kitchen to be disarticulated, deboned, and presented hot, supple, and ever so rich.  Rounded out with large, lightly fried prawns and candied walnuts topped with delicately honeyed mayo over chilled winter melons and finally six small dumplings filled with silky Kahlua cream plus a duo of gifts for the table it would be easy for me to say Blossom was the best Chinese restaurant I've experienced to date but taking it one step further I'd place it amongst my ten best meals in Las Vegas; food, room, and service rivaling some of the French, Spanish, and Italian Masters at a slightly more favorable price point.",

I recommend the Beef Chow Fun, Walnut Prawns, & the Fried Flounder. The walnut prawns are by far the best I've ever had, they are not completely soaked in the mayonnaise. There is enough drizzle to where you can still taste the shrimp. And placed underneath is a mound of cantaloupe and honeydew, I have never tasted a more perfect combination. The flounder is fried to a crisp and juicy. Overall, you're paying for what you get and this is a must stop in Vegas.",

    "text": "The thing about the high-end restaurants in Las Vegas is that so many of them are offshoots of famous restaurants in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Miami Beach. I skip most of them on my trips to Vegas because I can go to the exact same restaurant in New York City (or San Francisco or Miami Beach or LA).   Blossom is a restaurant that you will find only in Las Vegas. Prior to my first time at Blossom about half a decade ago, I would never have thought that I would travel to Vegas to dine at a Chinese restaurant. The Hong Kong style black pepper goose liver appetizer at Blossom has forever changed my views about the use of offal in Chinese cuisine. It's unlike anything else I've found anywhere else in the US. The best way I can describe it is foie gras with a delightful black pepper kick. I will sometimes get 3 servings of this phenomenal appetizer as my main dish.   Another unique appetizer that Blossom used to offer was the seafood medallions. This was like the lovechild of shrimp toast and crab rangoon. Much to my dismay, this menu item was discontinued a few years ago.   Service is very courteous and attentive, and prices are reasonable, given the excellent quality of the food and service.",

    "text": "Located inside the Aria Hotel this ranks highly among the best in Chinese fine dining.  If you're up for a big splurge and want to experience some delicacy seafood items in a nice upscale setting, accompanied with exemplary service (a rarity in most Chinese restaurants), give Blossom a try.  You'll find some Crazy Rich Asian-types here (of which I am not one), going all out in dining at this beautiful, Strip restaurant.  It can be compared to Wing Lei at the Wynn or Jasmine at the Bellagio, but in a more modern and intimate setting.  The evening started in an interesting way, as my waiter acknowledged me by my full name, welcomed me back, and proceeded to recite the precise date I was last there, down to the month, date and year.  I'm sure the stats are all in their system, but I've never ever experienced this.  A little odd, in a Big Brother sort of a way, but sounds like he was just abiding to their protocol.  I came specifically this time to try one specific dish, the \"Natural Nine\".  It consists of all my favorites, being fish maw, sea cucumber, abalone, lobster, chicken wings, mushrooms, duck feet, and bundled yam noodles.  It can be ordered as a hot pot, or braised.  I was initially planning on ordering the hot pot version, but opted instead for the braised preparation after a lengthy discussion with my waiter.   As it turns out, he made a great suggestion, and the dish, which served four for $168.00 was excellent!!  I particularly loved the fish maw and sea cucumbers.  I had requested that it be made with less salt, as some Chinese braised items can be overly salted, and my request was well accommodated.  I was there dining solo, but I ate enough for at least two, and took the remaining home.  I had some left over rice and asked to take it back.  They very nicely offered to provide me with fresh rice, for no additional cost.  When I got home, I was very pleased to find a nice sized container of fresh rice.  A very nice touch, which I've experienced in Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, but never ever at any Bay Area Chinese restaurant, fancy or not.    I'd say to pass on the wonton soup appetizer.  The accompaniments of the scallop and shrimp were good, but I really didn't like the odd tasting pork inside the wonton.  Frankly, I've had better tasting wontons in dives than I had here.  I should've known better than to order an every day dish in a fancy schmancy restaurant like this.    At the end of dinner, the waiter said that because I liked abalone, I might be interested in their abalone dishes, and shared a menu that focused just on abalone dishes, and another that was bird nest centric.  It would've been nice to see these menus at the beginning of dinner, though. Maybe a \"secret menu\"? If abalone dishes or bird nest dishes sound appealing to you, then ask for these separate menus up front.  Did I mention service here is also among the best I've ever experienced in Chinese restaurants including those in Asia?  My waiter, Danny, and the ancillary staff were all attentive, pouring my tea almost every time they walked by.  During my discussion about the specialty Chinese dessert soup of the day,  Danny, who only spoke Mandarin and knowing I only understood Cantonese, voluntarily brought over a Cantonese speaking waiter, who explained the dessert in detail to me in Cantonese.  That was nice, and definitely an anomaly for me.  What a welcomed departure from the curt service I'm accustomed to in the majority of Chinese restaurants!!  Of note is a change in policy I wasn't aware of.  When the restaurant phoned to confirm my reservation, they informed me that there is now a business casual dress code, and children under six are no longer permitted.  It didn't bother me, as I wasn't planning on dressing sloppily, nor was I planning on bringing any young children.  However, if you are planning on doing either, you may want to rethink a visit here.  Definitely a nice venue for high end Chinese.  Given the price, if you're planning on ordering more common Chinese dishes that you can easily find anywhere else, like chow mein, kung pao chicken or wonton soup, I'd say pass.  However, definitely make this a stop for more \"exotic\" seafood and specialty items here, which will not disappoint!",

The restaurant ended up getting pretty full, but it was easy to get a reservation.   From the start, the service and the ambiance were great. Blossom is really quiet compared to many other places on the strip. Kinda like being in a spa. Service was friendly and very attentive.  Food comes across as very traditional and classic. Everything I had was worth the price. There are a lot of very expensive items on the menu, but I didn't try any of those this time.   In terms of food I did have: - Hot & sour soup was good but spicier than I expected - Wor wonton soup was good if kinda standard  - Hong Kong style chow mein with scallops, fish, and shrimp was great. Noodles were crispy and seafood was perfectly-cooked.  - Kung pao chicken was a nice elevation of the dish with lots of flavor  I also had a \"matcha spice\" cocktail which was fine, but I wouldn't get it again. They do have a very extensive wine list if you're into that.  EDIT: Also, they gave us a nice box with some jasmine tea and a pineapple pastry to go with out check!",

The service was IMPECCABLE. And I don't say that with levity. We ordered the shiitake appetizer, the hot and sour soup, fried eggplant appetizer, the Hong Kong style lobster, the filet stir fry, and the string beans. The shiitake appetizer was the worst part because they made it super sweet and the texture was gummy. We didn't eat much of it. The eggplant and hot and sour soup were good in my opinion but my fiance loooved it way more than I did- I just thought they could have used more flavor. I really enjoyed the filet stir fry; it was extremely authentic and reminded me of eating dinner when I was a kid. The lobster was done well...but I was expecting a different kind of Hong Kong style that I'm used to eating in Chinatown in Boston when I was a kid.  The string beans were good too. They also had a great selection of Chinese alcoholic beverages :) overall great job and I'll definitely come back.",

Spicy Sour Soup (just a starter, nothing fancy) Peking Duck Lobster Sashimi Alaskan King Crab Rock Cod fish Some fancy smancy aged red wine Kobe Beef Fried large prawns  Now mind you, all this was comped!  =)  Nothing beats free.  But i'm sure they gambled a lot of $$$.  Hey, hope they won, but whatever. Back to the review.  Now, I'm not sure about their normal food, but these dishes were top notch.  The raw ingredients used matters, but it was also flavorful and well cooked.  The kobe beef had to be the best if you are a meat person.  The fat juice just burst out of the meat with every bite.    The alaskan king crab was also great, so rich and full.     The large prawns and soup was probably the most mediocre in this lineup.  I wouldn't want to eat this stuff everyday though.  The Cholestrol would kill you.",

From mouthwatering goose liver appetizer to the sweet ending Creme Brulee dessert, our bellies were treated to a scrumptious dinner. The prawns were huge, fresh, and flavorful. The lobster dish with ginger and scallions was delectable. Their interesting take on the Creme Brulee really put this whole experience over the top. The restaurant was gorgeous, and the staff were experience and friendly. Happy bellies for both hubby and I last night.",

Located in the aria hotel, it has a beautiful interior decor and something about the place made it seem extremely elegant and intimate. We ordered several dishes including the Peking duck. It may have been the best Peking duck I've ever had. Sliced to perfection accompanied by the bao buns. Their fried rice was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of rice. We ordered about 2 drinks each and some apps and the prices are extremely reasonable. Great portions for a dinner either before going out into the Las Vegas party scene or just to have dinner with some friends and enjoy a relaxing gambling filled night. When I'm back in Vegas I will definitely be back at blossom.",

The Peking Duck is cut table side and placed on a plate for you to make your own wraps. The fresh live prawns are steamed to perfection and very sweet in flavor. The Chinese sausage fried rice pairs well with all the dishes and is a must order. I wish we had a bigger group to try more dishes, but from what we had I know that everything else is probably pretty bomb. The service also deserves some compliments because the servers were more than pleasant! Let's just say, I will be back!",

Our water was always full (which is something I really appreciate).   As for the food, I was quite disappointed. For an appetizer, we ordered the salt and paper squid. It had a nice crunch to it, almost like calamari. I was looking for a little more salt in this dish since it was lacking in flavor. For dinner, we ordered the BBQ duck (not the Peking Duck), chow fun, fried Chilean Sea Bass, and Broccoli beef. Out of all the dishes, the Chilean sea bass was the best. It had the right amount of salt and a great sauce paired with it. As for the other dishes, I found myself putting the chili sauce on everything because the dishes weren't as flavorful. The BQQ duck was not BBQed enough. The beef broccoli (unfortunately) was under season as well as the chow fun. So for the pricing of everything, I was not satisfied. Though it was a pleasant experience, I do not think I was WOWed enough to revisit this restaurant. But thank you for a great time, Blossom!",

    "text": "With this Blossom visit we've now eaten our way around all the Aria restaurants (and a lot of other world-class eateries in USA and Canada). We unintentionally saved one of the best for last!  Let me get this out of the way- Blossom is pricey, it is very expensive on a per-dish basis.  With that said, when going to Vegas and expecting a very good experience, you should always simply *forget* about price. It's better that way, you can just relax and soak it in, and you have no need for guilt later. With that caveat out of the way...  Reservations were made, we received a follow-up call on day of dinner to confirm and remind of no young children policy unless in a private room. Yay! Thanks! (seriously) This is an adult experience and a sublime atmosphere and I relished that opportunity to reduce one potential risk of spoiling it.  We showed up on time, were greeted professionally and shown to our table which was very comfortable and private. The restaurant is arranged to facilitate privacy and intimacy with generous table spacing and differing levels. There are what appear at first glance to be framed mirrored panels between booths but are in fact clear glass panels. It's an optical illusion and aside from visual aesthetics, served to insulate and block sound from adjacent booths. Great design!  The atmosphere in general is low-key, dimly-lit and very sexy. Very conducive to big-dollar deals, romance, or just peaceful and relaxing! :-D  All this was great, however what quickly became apparent and carried through to the end of the night there was the service! Amazing! I just do not see how it could have been better. Water was topped off, used utensils and settings whisked away and quickly replaced, sommelier visits, and the \"main person\", I hate to call him a \"waiter\", let's say instead our \"Evening Experience Manager\" - Danny, was always on top of things. Top to bottom, front to back, absolutely perfect dining experience.  In fact, in a very fortunate life of varied dining experiences, I feel comfortable to call this this The Best Service We Have Ever Had In Any Restaurant Anywhere. So there it is.  The cocktails were delicious, I had a lychee martini, three actually, and they were superb. There is an extensive and well-curated wine and liquor list, some bottles extending deep into five-figures for those seeking a heroic end of night tab.    The food was very good and very artfully presented. The spot shrimp presentation was simply a work of art, and I won't post a picture so as not to ruin the surprise! I struggle a bit to describe the flavors and will settle on this - the food was respected and not overpowered with heavy seasoning and sauces. Some would instead call it plain or simple or under-seasoned. My suggestion to the reader is it takes courage to prepare fresh, unique ingredients with a light hand and to allow the natural (light, clean) flavors to shine through. If you like a heavy hand on flavorings, this will not be your favorite experience.    The dessert was, again, very well executed with a light hand and clean flavors.  I want to say thank you again to all who contributed to our dining experience at Blossom! Your attention to detail is and was appreciated! We'll be back for sure, there is a lot to try on the menu and we just scratched the surface.",

There's something here for all tastes and price points - for around $100, we had two entrees, two appetizers, and one amazing mojito. There are some more authentically Chinese dishes, but as fans of American Chinese takeout, it was fun to try the premium versions of our favorite lazy weeknight dishes. The walnut shrimp is out if this world - delicious fried shrimp on a bed of melon and candied walnuts, with mayo drizzled over. Sounds weird, but comes together beautifully. The shiitake mushroom appetizer was surprisingly tasty, but was swiftly overshadowed by the aforementioned pork. The kung pao chicken was perfection. I can't wait to come back and try the Peking duck - the table next to us ordered it and it smelled incredible.  The decor is lovely and the space is well-arranged. The service is without fault - attentive but unobtrusive, no waiting for refills or plates to be cleared. Fantastic meal!",

We had reservations and were seated promptly. I had very good impression regarding the wait staff. They were very efficient without being too intrusive. Waters were filled promptly. The sommelier came to take our wine orders. We instructed our waitress that we wanted the dishes to come at the same time since we wanted it \"family style\" dining. First came the duck. The duck took two wait staff to slice and put in sio pao buns. This particular duck was the highlight of our trip. It's one of the best Peking ducks I have ever tasted. It was succulent and moist. I would go back to this restaurant and just have the duck. We also had the flounder dish. This particular dish was a standout as well. I vividly remember the Peking duck and flounder dishes. My benchmark for an enjoyable meal are the unforgettable dishes and these two hit the spot. Together with exemplary service. We felt very pampered at this particular meal. I would go back to this restaurant again.",

    "text": "There is a final scene in Ratatouille when Anton Ego bites into a rustic peasant dish of ratatouille and drops his pen, amazed by the haunting replication of his mother's country cooking.  That would be me eating hom yu ji yuk bang at Blossom.   For the uninitiated, this is a rustic peasant Chinese dish of ground pork cake with salted fish.  It is an easy dish to make, but a difficult dish to make well.  The smell of this dish is akin to an Asian smelling blue cheese for the first time.  My wife smiled at me slyly anticipating some anguished white nose whiffs as the dish travels through the restaurant.  Who would ever order that here, she asked, how fresh can the salted fish be? When I bit into the dish, I slowly dropped my chopsticks to mimic Anton Ego.  This shit is good--the salted fish was tender, flaky,  and flavorful and the ground pork had a sweet salty taste that has the addictive allure of high quality spam--and I don't mean that in a bad way!  The walnut shrimp was almost perfect--it was just slightly overdone as the shrimp was not at its peak juicy, but the batter was light, the shrimp was jumbo, and the mayo was light.  It was served on a bed of cantaloupe and honeydew.  The dish had terrific textures of crunchy, slippery, hot and cold.  The lil guy's chicken soup had a clean sweetish broth taste that came from long-simmering chicken.  The only disappointment was with the stir-fried filet mignon.  The sauce was flavorful and peppery, but the texture was off.  It tasted a little like it had been in the freezer a little too long; the beef had a slightly mushy, dryish feel to it that did not seem right.  This was a surprise for us because it is precisely the kind of dish that would be popular here with non-Chinese, so the beef should be fresh due to turnover.  There was no wok hei(flavor that comes from the wok) in this dish.  The service was unparalleled.  I don't think I've had better service in a Chinese restaurant.  When they brought the sweet and sour soup for the lil guy, the waitress caught his crinkled expression and offered immediately to replace the spicy soup with something else.  When the lil guy expressed a wish for noodles in his chicken soup, the kitchen quietly made an off-menu dish for him.  When we had the hom yu boxed, the server offered another bowl of rice, as he knew this salty protein required a balancing carb.  Service was efficient, unintrusive, and friendly.  About half the customers were Asian, with Cantonese being spoken pretty freely.    Prices are high, ranging in the 20s to 40s, with rarer dishes upwards of $100-300, but still extremely reasonable compared to other such restaurants:  a dinner at Jean Georges or Bardot next door is easily twice the price.  It takes a particular skill to cook good Chinese food that is different from say putting a seasoned steak in a broiler.  Decor was beautifully tasteful.  I will definitely return to try other dishes, but the hom yu will be a staple for me at this restaurant!",

The things written in previous comments seemed to be written perhaps by employees, because there was nothing to make Blossom stand out.  Equally good food can be had in China town a few minutes away, at fully one third the price.   Go to blossom for the convenience if you are already at Aria, otherwise take a cab to China town .",

    "text": "Had a hankering for peking duck and searched restaurants along the strip for the best place. While yelp stars for Blossom wasn't the highest, I still selected Blossom based on the treatment of the duck. I was looking for table side carving with lots of crispy skin served with steamed buns. And while Blossom did this well, they also took the rest of the duck back to be chopped up as a duck entree. This was okay, but I was hoping for a larger serving Peking duck style with buns/wraps than just regular duck to eat with rice. We actually got our Peking duck served with both buns and wraps - the sauce was tasty and the cucumber/onions were fresh and crunchy. It was yummy and reminded me of similar experiences eating Peking duck in Bejing.  In addition to the duck, we had the hot and sour soup (spicy and tangy, one of the better hot and sour soups out there) and sauteed pea shoots (simple yet executed perfectly).   For drinks, I tried the Blossom cocktail, which consisted of a ginger/lemongrass infused soju, rock sugar, and was served with a Thai bird chili. It was very flavorful and I wish I remembered the rest of the ingredients! Definitely give it a try.  All in all, Blossom was fine dining at its best. Go for the experience. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Came here about 1 hour before they were closing with the husband, place was packed so had to wait a few minutes, but glad we did!   Ambiance - Place is dark, has a nice seating and set up and if you sit in the back area table or booths, it is a more romantic feeling than the middle section where there are larger tables for big groups.   Food - We were so lost! This was actually our first time to a \"Real\" Cantonese food place thingy. One of the ladies working there was kind enough to take a few minutes and go over the menu and point out favorites and ask about our tastes and after a few questions we made our order!  We chose to share two entrees, an appetizer and a fried rice. The portions were HUGE! Since we had never been here, we assumed fancy place, tiny portions, which is why we ordered so much, but next time, one entree would be more than enough for two people with a side of their awesome rice.   BBQ Pork -  This is made by an in house specialty bbq chef and it shows! When I first ordered it, I had the mindset of bbq pork from a normal Chinese take away restaurant, and wow I am glad I was wrong! This was so tender, juicy and just a little bit of the bbq sauce. It was perfection! No fat on the meat and none of that weird taste, I could barely tell it was pork.   Garlic Prawn Fried rice - Holy Prawn batman! These things were HUGE. I thought it would be a small portion of rice, but it came in this enormous bowl with at least 10 HUGE shrimp .. did I mention they were huge? More than enough for two people to share!   Chilean Sea bass -  This was so good, it was just ridiculous at this point. The outside was crispy and crunchy, perfection and the inside was juicy and melt in your mouth delicious. I wondered how on earth they were able to keep the inside So wet while the outside was crispy, but who cares, my taste buds didnt ask just questions, they just enjoyed.   Kung Pao shrimp - Not your favorite take aways kung pao, but like a billion times better. The shrimp were huge again, juicy succulent awesome shrimp. You know the shrimp you see on television commercials that just look so big and awesome but then you get sad little stuff at the actual place? Well these bad boys were the ones from the commercial, but better?!   10/10 ... would eat there again and again and probably another time just for safe measure.",

We ordered the tempura string beans to start. Very good. Perfectly cooked. Not to much batter which means you get more of the string bean taste. I was sort of hoping for a more of an aioli type sauce to go with it, but it was like a soy sauce type of mixture. Good but I wanted a more of a dipping sauce.   We ordered the Lemon Chicken, Mongolian Beef and Vegetable Chow Mein. Highly recommend the Mongolian Beef. That was delicious!!! The chow Mein was good as well. The Lemon Chicken was just okay. Nothing bad, nothing fantastic either.   The gave us mochi balls for dessert for free which was quite lovely.",

    "text": "Blossom is a Chinese restaurant in the Aria, and it's notable for a couple of reasons. One is that it's one of the most expensive Chinese restaurants I've ever visited. The other is that the food is truly delicious.  Matt B. and I went for a Friday dinner at the end of May with my brother Andrew C. and his girlfriend Celestine H., who had been to Blossom a few times before. We were able to make an 8:30 reservation just a couple hours in advance, after arriving in Vegas on an early evening flight. The dining room--opulent and high-ceilinged, decked out in clubby chinoiserie--felt quiet for a Friday night. I'm having a hard time picturing other guests in the restaurant, though it's possible the tables were just really spaced out. They were huge tables--we were seated at what must have been a table for four, but it felt like we were all very far away from each other.  Service was solid, polite and professional, almost formal, with wait staff in suits carving Peking duck and dropping plate after plate of food on our table. The one hitch was that the drinks were slow in coming, arriving well after our food started to arrive. The drinks were the weak part of our dinner at Blossom overall. We ordered cocktails, and they were pretty sweet across the board. I got the Mango Chili-Lime, which was my favorite of the bunch, with Tequila Ocho Plata, pineapple, mango, lime, and Tajin. Matt had the Time After Thyme, a whiskey drink with Suntory Toki, Creme de Cassis, lemon, and thyme; not bad, but nothing special. Andrew and Celestine had the Cherry Blossom--Grey Goose La Poire, lychee, Lillet, and cherry--and the Mandarin Orange--Hangar One Mandarin, watermelon, cucumber, and lime--neither of them very good.  The food was great, though, surprisingly so for a Chinese restaurant on a casino floor. The menu was massive and varied--we ordered what we thought was a lot of food and missed several whole categories. As it turned out, I was glad we got everything we did, both because it was tasty and because the portions weren't nearly as big as I thought they'd be. No bounty of leftovers from Blossom.  We started with the BBQ ribs and the BBQ pork, and both of these were superb. The ribs were wonderfully tender, fatty and slipping off the bone, lacquered with a sweet and savory glaze. I took pride in gnawing mine clean. The BBQ pork--I think this was char siu--was meaty and flavorful, served in thin slices. Both the ribs and the char siu came garnished simply with sprigs of cilantro, and I enjoyed them with the two sauces on the table--hot chili sauce and soy sauce swimming with jalapeno and red pepper.  We shared the Peking duck, and this became the centerpiece of our dinner. Our servers carved up the roast duck by our table, then prepared individual buns and wraps with duck, scallion, and plum sauce. They presented these to us neatly plated. We were offered a choice of steamed buns or wraps, and I got one of each. The duck was excellent--crispy skin, succulent meat, just right with the scallions and plum sauce and pillowy bun and thin Chinese pancake. I was disappointed, though, that we only got two buns or wraps each, as there was plenty of meat left, and I would've liked to make more of them. Instead, we got the leftover meat in a big heap with a side of sweet and sour sauce. This was great, too, but I missed the ritual aspect of the traditional Peking duck meal. (To be fair, this might only be because I took Chinese in college, and we spent like a whole month learning all the vocabulary around eating Peking duck--or as I forever remember it, Beijing kaoya.)  We rounded out our dinner with string beans, ma po tofu, and garlic prawn fried rice. The string beans were good, if not especially memorable, with a spicy XO meat sauce that could have been spicier. The ma po tofu was the most mediocre dish we ordered, not bad, but pretty bland. That fried rice, though, was fantastic--fluffy and flavorful, not shy with the garlic, with a decent number of plump, snappy, sweet prawns.  I wasn't expecting to find such impressive Chinese food on the Strip, and I'm not even mad that it cost twice as much as good Chinese food at home in L.A. (maybe four times as much, if you account for portion size). Not everything was amazing--and certainly the cocktails should've been better--but I loved the ribs and the pork, the duck and the fried rice. I'd be curious to try the crab sometime, though that's even more of a splurge. In any case, I expect I'll eat at Blossom again. I love Vegas and I love Chinese food, and now that I know about this place, I'll definitely want to come back.",

    "text": "Delicious but pricey Chinese food (but hey, what else do you expect in Vegas?)  The restaurant is located in ARIA. We had a bit of a hard time finding it since there weren't any signs and it wasn't in the lobby area, but we asked around and was directed to walk through the casino from the lobby, and it was on the right once we walked far enough.  My friend had made a reservation beforehand for Sunday dinner at 7 pm. I'd definitely recommend a reservation, as it was pretty empty when we first arrived but was mostly filled out by the time we left around 8:30.  A couple of us ordered cocktails, which were $16. I went with the mandarin orange, which was vodka based and had a lovely watermelon flavor. I tried a sip of my friend's mango chili-lime and the matcha spice, but the mandarin orange was by far my favorite if you like fruity flavors like me.  For food we ordered:  Steamed sea bass ($42): the sea bass was served on top of tofu. The sea bass was really fresh, but the main flavor came from the black bean sauce sprinkled on top, which didn't have quite enough flavor to cover the whole dish. Portions were also really small for the price  Spicy veal cheek ($35): it's not actually that spicy, which is a lot coming from me since I have zero spice tolerance. The meat was flavorful and tender. My second favorite dish of the night  Garlic prawn fried rice ($20): this was really good! Favorite dish of the whole table  Pan fried pea shoots ($25): solid veggie dish, but again, I couldn't believe how much we were paying for this dish  Service was solid, as you would expect from a high end place like this.  It was ~$60 pp for dinner + one cocktail.",

Well, that beautiful crab is one of the signature dishes at Blossom. My love and I were excited to meet some friends at Blossom, but come early for the crab, because on this visit, it was sold out! Meaning, we'll be back again with an earlier reservation!  When you walk through the entrance, the airy, yet well spaced out, dining room captures your eyes. It is quite an elegant space they've created with a beautiful, semi- translucent, white wall and an Asian inspired wooden door.   The menu is substantial, but not too overwhelming...Appetizers, Seafood, Meat and of course the Peking Duck! I'm not a big fan of duck since it is too greasy for my taste, but here at Blossom, it was crispy, tender and without so much of the greasiness that generally turns me off. In addition to the incredible duck, we also shared Steamed Seabass, crispy Calamari, Filet Mignon with Egg Plant, Seafood Rice Noodles, and Ochoi.    The staff was effortlessly moving from table to table, satisfying our needs and more, and all without any interruption. It was a delightful meal and a beautiful evening!  -2019 review #2-",

The shrimp lettuce cups were a solid choice as well. I would also highly recommend the hot and sour soup. It's super flavorful and full of spice. If you're not that into spices, the tofu + mushroom soup is also really good. It's the perfect comfort soup.   DRINKS I loved the drinks here. The cocktails are a bit dangerous because they taste soooo good!  ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE They told us to dress business casual -- but I'd say it's more business than casual. The place is quite fancy and the service was spectacular. Everyone was so kind and really took their time to take care of us. We had a vegan in our party and they brought out a vegan menu for her. They were also able to adjust dishes to accommodate her. Definitely vegan/vegetarian friendly!   Overall -- if I were rich, I'd eat here all the time!",

After we settled into a comfortable and opulent booth, this time I began with an interesting Amuse Bouche of spinach, garlic & ginger, along with a pot of Jasmine Pearls Tea for me, and a pot of Silver Needle Chrysanthemum Tea for Diane.  An array of starters included a Crisp-Fried Beef Roll with Enoki Mushrooms & Mandarin Brown Sauce, Pan-fried Pork Pot Stickers, and Vegetable Egg Rolls.  All were delectable.    While Diane enjoyed an individual serving of Wor Wonton Soup with Shrimp & Scallops, I delighted in a double serving of excellent spicy Hot & Sour Soup.  After finishing off the apps and soup course, we settled in with eager anticipation while awaiting the arrival of our ordered entrees.    I paired my main of Beef Tenderloin & Black Mushrooms in Black Pepper Sauce with Shrimp Fried Rice that had very small grains.  Steamed Stuffed Shrimp and Walnut Prawns went to fellow diners.    Service by Tony K. and others was nonstop.  I asked for Soy Sauce, Hoisin Sauce, Hot Chinese Chili Oil, and ginger, and received all of them plus Jalapenos in Soy Sauce and XO Sauce!  Though I hardly needed more food, to complete the meal I ordered the Ice Cream Trio: Taro Ice Cream, Mandarin-Yuzu Sorbet, and Chocolate Ice Cream served with a handmade Fortune Cookie.  Complimentary Sesame Cookies and a giant Fortune Cookie without a fortune inside rounded out our Cantonese feast  They were fresh and tasty.  Since its appearance, the empty Fortune Cookie has not resulted in any noticeable bad luck for me.  So I plan to return--a lot sooner than last time.",

To start, we did the fried ice fish appetizer and fried calamari both were a but flavorless and greasy. The goose liver was good, it was a nice take on a Chinese styled foie gras. The poached live prawns were good, but kinda small. Fried rice, Singapore noodles, XO string beans, and eggplant clay pot we're about the same quality that you would get in Chinatown here at a quarter of the price.   We ended the entrees with a 4 pound live coral cod. At $100 a pound, it was as expected... Super tender and incredibly delicious.   Service was good, but a little bit clumsy. The sauce platter was placed on someone's phone, and the servers spilled 2 glasses of water at our table. They recommended the prawns poached then later when bringing the check they told us the prawns are so much better a different way. So that was a little confusing and annoying  It's a Chinese restaurant at an MGM property. Similar ingredients and similar menu to Jasmine at the Bellagio, but if you are spending this kind of money on Chinese food... Jasmine is much better.",

By the end of our meal, I had hot tea spilled all over my arms and my fancy nye dress and our table cloth had a layer of extra cloth napkins over it... it looked sloppy and unprofessional at best.   For appetizers we had:  1. fried fish - super oily and too much batter 2. fried calamari - super oily and too much batter  3. Goose liver - very good  For entrees we had: 1. Singapore noodles - good 2. Santa Barbara prawns - they were good, but shrimp sized 3. Lobster fried rice - good 4. String bean xo - good 5. Coral cod - took forever, so by the time it came out we were full already and didn't really enjoy it as much  For dessert: 1. Mango pomelo cold soup: very refreshing in a weird way because i first saw it I almost thought some one throw up in this bowl of dessert , for real !  Ps : so when we were ordering food, the server David highly recommended having the prawns poached. Then when he was bringing the check he said we needed to get them cooked with garlic over noodles... we asked why he didn't recommend that at first and his only response was, \" because I want you guys to come back tomorrow.\" Smh",

Safe to say from top to bottom Blossom deserves so much more than a 5 star rating from me.  As we walked through Aria early in the day we wanted to try something new and after reminiscing of a previous stay in the Sky Suites we stumbled onto Blossom. After looking at the menu we looked at each other and something in our guts said to make reservations for later. We approached the hostess stand and to our surprise the hostess Abby was very welcoming and didn't have the customary \"holier than though\" attitude I've become accustomed to now when approaching the hostess stand dining on the strip. Kudos to her because even just a little nitch like that (as the first representation of the restaurant) makes you want to eat there.  Upon arriving I was taken back by the dining area. It was nice to sit secluded from the craziness of the casino and it's odd it was just that with it being right around the corner. It was very romantic and the staff are so attentive in all aspects of the meal that it creates an unforgettable experience. It was a zen moment indeed!  With that said, let's get down to the food and we certainly brought our A game that night (mostly me due to a health conscious spouse), but details schmetails right?!?  I must say that they have some of the most heavy cocktails comparing places on the strip and honestly reasonably priced. We'll say I was very \"pleasant\" by the end of the meal. Highly recommend for a \"good time\" a Long Island iced tea or perhaps a few. Haha.   Food wise, this is top notch Chinese cuisine and a must if you're craving that hands down! As you can tell we indulged from the following grocery list of goodies: lettuce wraps, potstickers, walnut prawns, braised bai ling mushrooms with baby bok choy, and sesame dough balls (if that wasn't enough). Complete meal? Darn tootin'!  I'll start by saying I am in way a fan of lettuce wraps, but this one is amazing. The lettuce was crisp and it's partnered with hoisin sauce which really complimented things overall. The potstickers were not mind blowing if I'm being honest, but I did appreciate them being fresh and non greasy as I'm used to seeing. The bai ling mushrooms and bok choy were so moist and had a hint of smokiness it seemed that really shocked my palette in a good way. The highlight of the night was the walnut prawns. The shrimp was melt away tender and the walnuts were a perfect mix of crunch and sweetness. Heaven on a plate indeed! If that wasn't enough dessert consisted of a hand made fortune cookie (minus the fortune) and sesame dough balls. It really was like eating a very healthy doughnut, but I couldn't think of a better way to say goodbye to the dining experience.  All in all, the ambience is remarkable. The food is impeccable. The staff is stellar at really making sure everyone leaves satisfied. Now THAT is how you do a culinary experience!",

We started off with wine from Spain,  Emeritus Pinot Noir and Dolce from Napa, CA. Our server Kristina suggested some great dishes. She went over the items in a very detailed way and flavors on point. The Pot Stickers are made of fresh Dough with Pork and Vegetables. The hot and sour soup had a nice kick to it. The Twin Noodle Chicken has Rice Vermicelli and Bean Thread Noodle. Fresh and clean.  Crisped fried Chilean Sea Bass tasted delicate with Pan -Fried Chinese Broccoli and Mongolian beef served with either white, brown or red rice...taste very similar to brown. The highlight of the dessert is the lychee creme brulee...",

However the food we received must have had high msg as soon as I ate my rice my stomach bloated big and the chow mien was super greasy and we couldn't ever eat it . The soup was the only thing non greasy . They saw we left the two huge plates and instead of asking what is wrong ? They just told us to box it up and take it home .  We were Ina hotel room with no fridge ? $111.00 with just water ,one beer and was not worth the stomach pain and still going hungry .  They doubted so much we could pay the waitress took ten mins to ask how much it was to add noodles ??? We didn't care about $3 really ??  Also she asked for our ID and made a comment about my age as I'm 42 and my boyfriend is thirty !  What kind of unprofessional behavior is that ? Pretty place but not worth the money go else where ! Please private message if you want to discuss this",

The food was good and the staff was super nice! I really liked the Decor of the place! The portions were really large and we were told that they are usually shared so we ordered 3 plates to share between the 4 of us and I'm definitely glad we did! They even gave us ladies a little gift to go home with that had a tea bag and little dessert which represented good luck in there! I really thought that was a cute touch! Overall i enjoyed the evening!",

Fyi: I had pecking duck from one of the best Peking duck restuarant in Beijing. The duck was served with skin and meat and sauce on a wrap. Ummm. It should be served with skin only? The skin is not crispy enough. The sauce is ok. After that the duck was brought back to chop. The meat was juicy but have a bit of distinct smell of the duck. Overall, the Peking duck is better than other places in So cal like duck house. But it is far from comparable to the Peking duck I had in Beijing.  And for the price, I would expect better quality.",

Even when the restaurant is fully booked they always accommodate us quickly. Will always return here. Try the crab fried rice as well, it's a real treat.",

The duck was only served 1 way. They carve it table side & serve it with buns or wraps.  It was good but we've had excellent peking duck for a lot less money, served 3-ways. Blossom will charge a ridiculous upcharge if a customer wants it served 3-ways. I had to take away 1 star for that.  The fish & tofu was a wonderful dish & a perfect pairing with the duck.  Overall, we thought paying over $100 for only 2 items was pretty pricey for the average joe.",

The walnut prawns I have to say was my favorite it's jumbo shrimp with glazed walnuts and melons all drizzled with mayo, I could of kept eating but there was no more left.  After dinner we were given these cute sesame cookies ( fancy fortune cookies) they had a similar taste to a fortune cookie but softer, again I was impressed.

But nothing stood out too much or at least nothing I can't get (besides the duck liver) at other Chinese restaurants.   Drink and dessert menus are on their iPads. But the iPad seems laggy.",

Multiple people besides our waiter stopped by our table to see what we needed and serve our food, and each person knew EXACTLY what to ask, with excellent timing.  Even the high end \"Chef on TV\" restaurants in Las Vegas could learn from these guys.    I had the Szechuan Shrimp, Vegetable Fried Rice, and  Crisp-Fried Beef Roll for an appetizer.  All were excellent and good portion size.  I really wanted to try a dessert but had no room left.  I also like the fact that between the booths is a piece of glass.  I didn't have to hear the conversations on either side of me.  Nice touch.",

Especially love their walnut shrimp, hot and sour soup, and their shrimp rice dish. Their wine list to pair with the entree is great and their staff is super friendly and knowledgable.   I always prefer a small table on the side that allows for great people watching and a great view of the restaurant. We were here for Chinese New Year as well last visit and boy did they decorate!

We started out with shark fin soup with abalone, chinese herbs, and sea cucumber.  I did not order this soup, so I will not comment on the taste since I am not a fan of shark fin or sea cucumber to begin with.  We then had an array of entrees which included Alaskan King Crab, fish, a beef entree, and a sauteed romaine lettuce looking dish (sauteed at the table in a heated clay pot).  All in all service was good (as expected), ambiance and atmosphere was nice, and the food was not terrible.  The highlight of the night was the Alaskan King Crab which was sweet and succulent.  However, I still would not go back to this restaurant.",

Not sure if theyre catering to a las vegas tourist crowd by bland-ifying all their dishes but there you have it...good but bland and not cheap! While the staff were great we wouldnt go back.",

Firstly, they really have delicious dishes, which I think is the best Sichuan Cuisine that tastes very similar with my hometown food in the town. The restaurant is located in the casino floor and takes few minutes to walk from the self-parking or Valet parking. The front of restaurant is not very obvious and might need to ask for direction. The whole decoration of restaurant is close to modern Chinese style and the light inside is not bright, but for me it's comfortable and quiet during the dining time. I did not have tour to the kitchen. The best dish I like over there is the Sichuan Style boiled beef. The Spicy boiled beef appearance red chili peppers on the top; the soup in the dish also is dull, close to the dark red. It smells pungent, spicy with Chinese prickly ash. The dish includes beef, tofu, and lettuces, beef is chewy, tofu is soft and absorbed soup become very juicy. Whole flavor is very spicy and pungent with oily soup. The taste could stay in the mouth for long time. To balance this spicy dish, it could add some vinegar for a little bit sour.",

    "text": "Blossom is the Chinese restaurant located inside Aria, in City Center.  We stayed at Aria on opening weekend, and ate at Blossom that Sat.    I love Chinese food, and I'm always looking for the next great place here in Las Vegas.  So far my favorite is Red 8 at the Wynn.  But I had high hopes for Blossom.    Blossom's interior is nice, but a little busy.  It fits in well with the rest of Aria.  We were seated right away.  The tables are fairly close together, and if it was really busy, it could have been a bit cramped.  But we didn't have that problem.    Our waiter arrived to the table quickly and had our drinks ready within 3 minutes of arriving.  The menu at Blossom is simple and pricey, with some entrees at $300+.    One item that popped out at me was the \"live fish\".  I'm hoping this just means fresh fish, not an actual live fish, like the disgusting YouTube video.  I thought about asking, but it's so odd that I thought it might be offensive.    Everything we had was really good, but I wouldn't say it was good enough to justify the price.  Red 8 is significantly less expensive, and is far better quality food, in my opinion.  I would say that Blossom is more on par with Shanghai Lilly in Mandalay Bay, except at 3X the price.    I would have rated the place at 3 stars, but something happened that made me add a star for service.  As we were being seated, we were offered drinks.  My girlfriend just asked for a Diet Coke.  I asked her is she wouldn't prefer having a drink to celebrate the fact that this is her birthday dinner.  (she was turning 30, and I thought that would require a drink)  She said no, and we had our dinner.  After dinner the waiter brought over a beautiful, and exotic looking tower of deserts for my girlfriend's birthday.  This was unsolicited, and beyond the call of duty for our server.  The entire staff of Blossom and Aria were top notch, and made everything very pleasant.    So in summary, not the best Chinese in Las Vegas, especially for the price.  But if you're staying at Aria, and you appreciate good service, Blossom is a good bet.",

There was an item on the menu that went for $300.  Our fish dish was $42 and had 5 small pieces of fish that were probably no more than 8 ounces of meat combined.  The best dish was the oxtail stew, which featured succulent pieces of oxtail with carrots and celery in a tangy tomato sauce.  The oxtails could have been more tender, but it was still a successful dish.  Be warned, they charge you $2 for rice.  Lychee creme brulee was also quite tasty.  Bottom line, the food is very good, but the prices are scandalously outrageous.  They must be marking their food up by 500%",

But when you're paying this price I want to be knocked off my socks in flavor. It just felt bland.   We order a three course meal which came to about 100 with no alcoholic drinks. The App was great but small. Wanted a few more dumplings. The main was beautiful to look at, but lacked any sort of memorable feelings. The dessert was near impossible to mess up and it was good.

As you approach the restaurant the traditional colorful decor welcomes you. Even though the decor is traditional it has an upscale contemporary feel. The service is top notch. The menu is huge. I have never seen so many seafood selections. We ordered large...as always. Just can't decide. Lettuce Wraps, Kung Pao Shrimp, Mongolian Beef, Chow Mien and Chinese Sausage Fried Rice. All delicious. Cocktails were also excellent, prepared by the Baccarat Lounge next door. Everything works here. From the service to the quality food. A great evening.",

That was about the best thing that happened at this restaurant. We decided to come here based on the reviews about the food and their \"great\" service. Sadly, we did not get to experience anything of that caliber. Instead we were met with non existent service and a waitress who came off very rude. We had ordered our dishes and the waitress said \"you should probably order one more dish it won't be enough.\" So no big deal we ordered another dish.   Some of our food came out and noticed all the tables around us had bigger dinner plates, except we had the small appetizer plates. We waited for about 15 mins till we could track someone down. Finally we asked the manager Eddie, his response \"we thought you guys would be more comfortable with the smaller plates since there is a lot of you. In response I said \"that's funny because you guys changed the plates of the table behind us and they have the same group number and size table\" he quickly said he would have them changed and he did.   We let one of the guys changing our plates know we were still waiting for one soup & another chicken plate and he said he would let our server know. After 15 mins or so, our waitress finally showed up. And when she did she created us with \"you guys did not order anymore food.\" And I said \"yes we did my father asked for our macadamia nut chicken\" and she said \"no he did not. I can place that order for you now.\" With that said my father then asked \"well, what about the soup?\" And she said \"you didn't order that either, I can place it for you now.\"   At this point I didn't even want to be in this restaurant anymore. I feel like it would have been very different if she came up and said \"I apologize for the confusion but...\" instead of going straight into \"you guys didn't order anything else\" when we all know we specifically did because she even suggested ordering more food.  I really don't want to play the race card here but I feel like we were discriminated against. Our table was the only colored group in the mix. As an Mlife member I expected more. But for mediocre food for $30 a plate, & non-existent service I can for certain say I will never come again.",

Two points of constructive criticism:  1) They did not stagger the appetizers and entrees  well at all. No more than three minutes after finishing our appetizers did our dinner arrive. I would have appreciated some time to digest the appetizers.   2) There were extra table chairs in the vicinity of our table and an unoccupied chair at our booth. The hostess sat us at the booth and did not remove the chair. Our waiter arrived, took our drink order and did not remove the chair. The waiter came back to take our dinner order and still did not remove the chair. Employees of Blossom!, if there is an unoccupied chair at a table, you need to remove it. I had to get up and remove the chair myself. This was poor form.",

    "text": "BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. I was excited to eat here & try the Peking Duck, as my parents & 2 sisters came here in June and could not stop raving about it. My husband and I love eating amazing food as does our 3 1/2 year old son, who has eaten at many high end restaurants in Los Angeles, San Francisco, & Denver since he was 1 year old. My sister made a reservation for a party of 7 and was told that if we had children under 6 she would need to book a private room, so she did. The reservation was made more than 3 months in advance. When we arrived, the 2 hostesses greeted us coldly and told us that there is a $1500 minimum to book a private room. This was not explained to my sister when she made the reservation. Because if it was, we would have made other arrangements so that we could have some of our family eat at Blossom one night and then the other family members eat there another night. The hostesses were not welcoming or accommodating. It was our last night in Vegas so we couldn't split up the nights. We promptly went to STK in the cosmopolitan, which is a very high end restaurant and they not only accommodated us, they treated my family and especially my 3 1/2 year old son with respect and a welcoming hospitality we rarely see nowadays. Our STK waiter also complimented me on how well behaved and how much of the yummy food my son had eaten. I understand that not many 3 1/2 year olds behave or eat as well as my son does, but to have a policy to restrict families with children under 6 to book a private room AND agree to pay a $1500 minimum to eat at a restaurant is absurd and discriminatory. You might as well just say you don't allow children. I guess some adults forget they were children at one point too. If the hostesses were more helpful instead of judgmental, we would have tried to come back here another time and would have recommended this place to many of our foodie friends. But now we'll just have to recommend our friends to NOT eat at Blossom as a matter of principle.",

An elegant, authentic Chinese eatery, Blossom is a beautifully designed space with sleek, Asian-style decor. Our group of four comfortably sat in one of the great booths along the wall, which allowed for great views of the restaurant. Blossom wasn't busy on a Wednesday evening around 9p, but I'd still recommend making a reservation to ensure your party gets a nice spot.  Service was friendly but a bit bizarre. We inquired about certain items on the menu since dish names are vague & descriptions are short. We specifically asked about the Pan Fried Stuffed Shrimp Moss on Tofu & Pepper.... what is moss? Our waiter gave a really odd reply, saying that the shrimp's set on top of the tofu & 'looks like moss,' hence the name. Hmm. We rolled with it, but when the dish came out, it was obvious that our waiter had never eaten nor served it before. Or perhaps the kitchen gave us a different meal altogether... we'll never know! Either way it was so delicious and overall our favorite order. The cubes of tofu were delicately crispy on the outside but so smooth inside. And surprise!... a little shrimp is waiting for you in the center of each square - so good! Beware of the the shrimp stuffed peppers though - they are so so so SPICY.  The beef of the Mongolian Beef was quality and tender, but the sauce was a little too sweet for our liking. The Spicy Indian-Style Fried Rice wasn't really spicy at all and the plate presentation was lacking.  In any case, the food and ambiance of Blossom were very good, and I'd definitely return to explore more of the vast menu.",

The dinner menu has many familiar classic Chinese dishes that you could order elsewhere for much less, but you're coming here for the quality of the food and the experience. For one night, just forget that you saw the $20+ price tag for that walnut shrimp. There are also two prix-fixe options: the Early Evening Menu and the Signature Tasting Menu. My boyfriend and I went with the latter, which offers a well-rounded dining experience.  Soup - Wor Wonton: A delicious, mellow broth with dumplings, rice noodles, plenty of enoki mushrooms, and scallops and shrimp.   Appetizer - Goose Liver (not on the Signature Tasting Menu):  Superb. There was a sweet and savory blend of spices that complement the fatty richness of the tender liver. The flavors were unique and unlike other goose livers I've tried.   Appetizer - Crisp-fried beef roll with enoki mushrooms: This was fine. I wasn't expecting a small meat roll inside. A word of caution: cut this sucker in half before eating. This was HOT!  Appetizer - Crisp-fried eggplant: Out of the three, this was my favorite. Pairs well with the spicy HK vinaigrette sauce, though perfect on its own.  Appetizer - Pot Stickers: Plump and filled with a lot of flavorful meat.   Main Course - Beef Tenderloin With Portabella Mushroom and Black Pepper Sauce: Cooked to medium-rare perfection with heavy black pepper.  Main Course - Crisp-fried Chilean Sea Bass: Flaky and delectable, but it definitely requires the sweet soy sauce that it comes with.  Main Course - Yang Chow Fried Rice: If you aren't full by now, the fried rice will do the trick and fill you up. Tasty, high-end fried rice.   Entree - Hong Kong Style Chow Mein (Seafood): Plenty of seafood and garnished with stalks of Chinese broccoli. Loved the crunchiness of the noodles.   Dessert - Mochi Ice Cream: There are three flavors: green tea, red bean, and mango. Both green tea and red bean were delightful.  Service -  Excellent, and they even gifted a box containing a pineapple cake and sachet of tea.  Overall - I had an enjoyable dining experience.",

At Blossom, they peel the whole duck into thinly pieces and wrapped in a special flour made paper with sliced cucumber, scallion and special made sauce.

The servers here aren't very good and are very aggressive in trying to have you order more drinks, food, ect. Way too pushy for my liking.

Honestly, I think you wind up paying high prices for mediocre, routine Chinese food just because it's placed on nice plates and surrounded by beautiful decorations at Blossom.   Yes, they have a wide variety of dishes and specialties like shark fin, giant clam, abalone, and bird's nest but aside from that, their entree selection is no different from other standard Chinese restaurants (Panda Express is not an example). Like most Chinese restaurants, the entrees are made to share and the portions are decent size. They have plenty of wine and beer to choose from. Our service was excellent. Without us having to ask, the waiter brought out toothpicks and complimentary sesame balls.  If you're just dying and in need of some Chinese food loving, then this place is not bad and will satisfy your craving. But if you're visiting Vegas and looking to try the \"best\" restaurants, I would pass this place up.",

My buddies and I wanted to experience a higher end Chinese restaurant on our trip to Vegas, and the Yelp reviews (for the most part) were favorable. Unfortunately out of the 7 entrees and 2 soups we ordered, all of them looked good in terms of presentation, but ultimately were very disappointing in taste.  My chow mein was particularly very salty, in a MSG type of way. How you tell the difference? Salt makes you very thirsty right away, while MSG will hold off on that thirst until the very end, then you will do anything for water.   It also concerned me that many of the items were not recommended by the waiter, who said spiciness level of hot pot cannot be adjusted as they come pre-mixed, and e-fu noodles were very soggy. Why are they on the menu then!?  The decor is nice, that's about the only impressive part of our dinner.",

    "text": "This is my new go-to place for Chinese food. It's always a good sign to see Asians  dining in an Asian restaurant too, which is the case here.  Off to a slow start waiting 5-10 minutes for a waiter or menu but the service was great after that.  I was dining alone and the entrees are big enough for 2 to share, especially if you get appetizers.  I had the hot and sour soup which was great. There are several other apps I wanted to try but it would have been too much food for one person.  FYI they only use white meat chicken (the stringy thin pieces all Chinese restaurants use).   Be sure to ask the knowledgeable waitress about the dishes. The chicken hot pot says \"spicy with garlic and onions.\" The waitress told me it also has basil and mushrooms and when I got it it had much more basil and mushrooms than onions and garlic. They should make the menu more accurate. It was not as spicy as I expected. I would say 3 out of 10 so if you like hot and spicy ask for it extra hot.  The hot pot is a large portion but I was able to finish it on my own. They charge extra for a small side of steamed rice which is annoying.  Overall not many chicken dishes and not too many hot and spicy dishes. Many seafood options and a good number of beef dishes.  I also but down into what I think was a clump of dirt or sand which was gross and the texture and grains lingered a bit, very surprising.  They have loose leaf tea which comes in a  large pot but with no strainer! Do not only do you get bits of tea in your cup but by the 3rd cup the tea is bitter since you can't remove the tea. I would expect much better than this. The tea was good and the pot poured at least 4 or 5 small cups of tea.  I had the Asian sweet mango soup dessert which was refreshing but essentially is a fruit smoothie served with a spoon or the equivalent of melted fruit sorbet. It had a few fruit chunks and was good but I think they could make it more interesting by thickening it or giving it a custard or frozen smoothie texture. They also have French pastry desserts.  Overall very good, closer to 3.5 stars. I will be back to try more apps and beef dishes.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located within the Aria hotel complex. The interior of the restaurant is tastefully decorated, but the atmosphere is a bit \"sterile\". The service is not very attentive and friendly. The menu is extensive, but very similar to average Chinese restaurants. The wine list is only available on a tablet, and is extensive, with all price ranges. The food is severly overpriced, especially the seafood dishes. The food is tasty, but nothing really special, as expected for this price segment., A general impression: average quality and highly overpriced. I do not recommend it.",

The prior day we had checked with the hostess ( a different one... The nice one ) if it would be okay to bring our baby . She had assured us it's ok as long we take care of her if she gets cranky (very reasonable and fair). We had also what time slot is the slowest for them. The Monday hostess gave us a look when she saw our baby. The restaurant had a total of 4 tables occupied while we were there included us and another family with a baby. On asking if they had a high chair , the Monday hostess sarcastically replied we need to sit down before someone can bring it over , which was very off putting.  Thankfully every other server after her was wonderful . They put us and our lil one at ease. We had the egg rolls, garlic prawn fried rice and Kung pao chicken. The fried rice was amazing. A lil box with tea bags and pineapple cake accompanied our bill. Would definitely love to come back here and try out other options.. Just not on a Monday !",

    "text": "Excellent experience- one of the finest restaurants we've been to in a while!  The hostess and wait staff are very attentive and formal- service was top notch. The ambience is serene and upscale- you know you're in for a high-end dinner.  I had the tempura fried Chilean sea bass and my girlfriend had the seafood chow mein. The sea bass was amazing- moist on the inside and lightly fried on the outside. The portion was very generous- no need for an appetizer.  The chow mein was likewise amazing- flavorful and with scallops, shrimp, fish, and squid.  We also got tempura fried string beans, which were good.  It's pricey, but you get what you pay for, which in this case was amazing Asian food. We'll be back in a future Aria visit.",

    "text": "This place definitely has some authentic and delicious Chinese food.  It was great to see that the majority of the workers speak Chinese and that the menu is in both Chinese and English.  The service is superb and I love the little box of pineapple cake/ tea that they offer you with the check.  So why only three stars?  The place obviously has a very Americanized menu with the typical Kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef, and everything else you'd expect to see at pf changs.  I was not impressed with the overpriced duck for 39 and could not believe Peking duck would be 75?!  A table next to ours ordered it and it looked great and I loved the table side prepping and serving but am still dumbfounded.  The duck had a little too much fat for my liking but the food overall is very well done.  I LOVED my drink that had a kick of chili in it, long life something or other?  Anyways, good place if you are craving authentic Chinese food but expect to pay the typical Vegas prices!",

    "text": "Overpriced Chinese cuisine located in Aria Hotel. Your visit should be enjoyable if you know what to order. There were five of us. We ordered soups (corn chowder, 3 hot and sour, and a tofu and mushroom). My tofu and mushroom soup wasn't very good. The broth was salty and tasted like the canned chicken broth.       On the other hand, the steamed spot prawns were to die for. These prawns were the size of my pointer finger all the way down to the end of my thumb (and I have big hands). Don't forget to slurp all the ocean-y goodness from the head. I feel cheated though because I was told they would have eggs in them. They must not be in season. They were mild, fresh, and sweet. Loved their condiment with spicy peppers soaked in soy sauce. Watch out, it's spicy! We ordered two pounds, roughly about ten pieces.       We also ordered the tempura fried ice fish with salt and pepper. Salty but anything deep fried will always taste good. Next was the Peking duck served with buns and wrappers. There was nothing special about the duck. Pretty standard duck, I'll pass on it next time. Chinese sausage fried rice and garlic ong-choy (spinach family) were also just mediocre.       Steamed red cod live fish was HUGE. A whopping four pounds ($48/LB). The fish was steamed with soy sauce, green onions, and probably garlic and ginger. The flesh was flaky, sweet, and the sauce complemented the fish well.       The damage at the end was over $600 and that's without tip. Oh yeah, I had a Stella just one! Overall, the meal was a well-rounded meal. Service was great. Overpriced for sure. Next time, I would order a few specialties like the spot prawns. Everything else you can find cheaper off the strip. Last meal in Vegas, see you next time.",

    "text": "We were looking for a place in Vegas that served Peking Duck with the buns and found Blossom on Yelp. It's located inside Aria Hotel and although I've stayed at Aria several times, I've never seen this place, it's kind of hiden. Once found, I thought it was so beautiful, definitely and upscale restaurant. We of course ordered the Peking duck which was $79 and you have a choice of it being served with wraps or buns, I much prefer the buns. They brought the whole duck to our table and carved the duck skin in front of us then place them on top of the buns. It was delish, better than the ones I had in Beijing a couple of years ago. We also ordered the Braised Shark Fin Soup, which was on the chef's special menu for $148 a bowl. The fins aren't shredded, you get the whole fin, this serves one but we split it and it was fulfilling since we also ordered other items. Next was the Eggs and Dried Scallops fried rice which was about $25 and an order of Lobster with Garlic and Ginger, this was fried to perfection at $120. Every single thing we order tasted really good, high quality food, fine dining at its best.  The service was also top notch, I used to go to Jasmine for Asian Fine Dining but this is my new spot,  I highly recommend this place!",

Me and my friends had 2 tasting menus, the cods, and 3 hot and sour soups.   blah, the lobster sauce wasn't good at all though, the filet was cooked well, and the general tao was like it came from a mall food court.  hot and sour soup: ok... but i was starving and it was the first thing I ate all day  dim sum sampler: do not order. it's 3 little dumplings, maybe even frozen?  the cod was pretty good.. but i've never had a bad miso cod..  overall I wouldn't go again, a waste of money for what you get. i might as well have gone to panda express. the ambiance was ok though.",

    "text": "Best duck!  We will be back. Would have given 5 stars for outstanding service and great food, but towards the end of our meal they seemed to forget about us (or they just got too busy).  I recommend you go with as many people as you can get to go with you because you'll want to try many items. The portions are generous - unusual for a restaurant with prices this high. When I asked the server about specials or items not on the menu, she freely and openly tried to list the numerous options from cold appetizers like jellyfish and duck wings to spicy szechuan style soup.    Our meal started with an amuse bouche of bitter melon in a sweet and spicy sauce (delicious). We followed this with the roast port (char siu) - this portion looked to be about 8 oz - also delicious, and the goose liver. The goose liver was presented as two slices (about 1/4\" thick) nicely charred and crisp on the outside and incredibly creamy on the inside served over shredded radish/carrot. For our main course(s), we ordered the duck 3 ways. With the first duck course we were offered a choice of pancakes/wraps or buns, we chose both. Usually, I like the buns best, but their pancakes were so light and delicate, I will choose the pancakes in the future. The duck itself was moist and flavorful with the right amount of crispy skin. Our second duck course was a stir-fry with bean sprouts and onion. We finished with the soup. Here they served it in two parts. They cut up the bones with tofu, mustard greens, garlic, etc. to make the broth, then they served the soup as a consomme and put the bones + on a separate platter. We loved all three duck courses. We've had Peking duck all over the world and this was probably the best version we've ever tried.  This restaurant also has a full bar and their bartender knows how to make martinis.",
