    "text": "Favorite Mexican place in Vegas. I have been here four times now and ordered something different every time. the chilaquiles are amazing as well as the fajitas and the albondigas taste homemade! Juan was our server tge most recent time. He was VERY attentive which i truly appreciate especially since it was the middle of the lunch rush. I never even had to ask for a drink refill because i had a fresh drink before i reached the bottom! The amuse buche is tortilla chips salsa and homemade refried beans. These beans are as good as my own mothers but dont tell her i said that! This is the only traditional authentic tasting mexican restaurant i have found since moving to LV. I reccommend the chicken mole. The sauce is rich and thick and frafrant with spices. You will not regret it!",

This dish is full of flavor, very tasty. There were various shrimp prepared differently. The crab legs were also tasty. The rice served in the platter was my favorite with a flavorful sauce that included fish and squid -- yummy!! Violeta, our server, was very gracious and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place and come back next time we're in town.",

In Hawaii we have Mexican Restaurants but none are as good as this one. I was amazed at how authentic the food was because it really felt like home. The atmosphere was great and the service and employees were friendly. I hope to go back one day to eat here again.  FINAL JUDGEMENT:  5 STARS-----Customer Friendliness  5 STARS-----Taste of Food 5 STARS-----Restaurant Appeal  4.5 STARS-----Pricing (Well worth the cost)  4.5 STARS-----Cleanse   AVERAGE 4.6-4.8 STARS but Ill give it a 5 STARS simply because its too good to be missed.",

Anyway, decor, service and food did not disappoint. The restaurant has a very authentic feel and I love the decorations. Our server and other staff were very pleasant during our dining experience; chips and salsa and drinks never went empty. We both ordered combination plate entrees--mine was a pork guacamole burrito (excellent), a cheese enchilada, and a chicken taco. We also enjoyed the house margaritas which are offered through check in. They were so good, we opted for one more :) I would definitely recommend this place for people looking for good, authentic Mexican cuisine.",

We had very nice coffee and split a flan.  I thought at around $18 the entrees were overpriced. Portions are not overwhelmingly huge which is good. A good solid family place- not Wow but Good.",

    "text": "*The BEST Fideo soup. Ever.   My favorite Mexican Food place in town, hands down. Better than Viva Zapta's, Roberto's and some of the more expensive places. They give you free chips, salsa and bean dip from the get go. If you order an entree they bring the tomato/noodle (fideo) soup out pre-meal as well. The enchiladas are fluffy and cheesey and the enchilada sauce isn't so strong or greasy it gives you heartburn. The 'Mexican Pizza' appetizer is awesome, very crunchy with light fluffy chicken (or beef if you choose) on top. They'll make guacamole right at your table for like $7. It can get a little chunky if you put everything in it, but it's a big amount you can take home. I enjoy everything I order here and have heard rave reviews about the Steak Ranchero as well. Haven't had anything bad yet. I'd like to save room for once to try their fried icecream, it looks like they give a generous portion!",

It's still not the best Mexican restaurant in the world, but it's definitely one of the best in Las Vegas!  Every dish I've tried is delicious and the portions are extremely generous for the price. The menu is ridiculously extensive. There is just too much to choose from sometimes. I try to get someone to share dishes with me so I can get a taste of multiple things.   I enjoy the decor and as a fan of clowns (rare, I know) I actually quite enjoy the back room that is decorated solely with clown figurines and pictures.   Great place for large groups as well.

This hidden gem of the strip tailors to the local clientele.  What a treat it is. They would of gotten a 5 star from me but. Customer service is a bit busy. This restaurant can probably hold 200 plus. And frequently they do. So food is great! But service is slow. Try the homemade gugamole, just like mom made at home right in front of you ( table side.) Thanks Vegas coming back soon again.",

My hubby and my daughter went with another couple who also had a 3yo and they had an easily accessible table for the 6 of us. Us ladies ordered frozen guava margaritas which were veeeeery tasty and the consistency was very smooth. I'm usually a rocks kinda girl and I'm truly not a guava fan but I tried hers and needed one too!!! While we were deciding our server brought out sopa de fideo for the kids which was nice because we didn't even ask! Now to the food! With the location of this place the prices surprised the hell out of me.....I'm not saying it was uber expensive but the average was probably $15 which is a little out there for a Mexican restaurant IMO. Every meal comes with chips, salsa, and beans and the sopa. I had birria de chiva which is goat cooked in a red sauce or was pretty delish! Hubby had a shrimp/octopus coctel it was the usual nothin special. The other couple had an enchilada and then shrimp fajitas. All pretty ordinary. I did see they make guacamole table side and got to watch another table have it made it looked pretty cool!  We were too full for dessert...  Service was good Drinks were awesome  The food...nothin special. Will I return, yes! I think I'm gonna try somethin different/unique so they can change my mind a lil :)",

We were immediately seated in a nice quite area of the restaurant even though they were quite busy. The wait staff immediately greeted us and took our drink order, and served the complimentary chips and salsa.   I ordered the Steak Cilantro with a Strawberry Margarita while my husband ordered Carne Asana tacos. Our food was delivered within a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the steak well done (I typically order it rare but I knew better than to do that outside of a steakhouse) and was surprised when it came a little pink. It was absolutely perfect, moist and thankfully did not make me sick from being undercooked. My husband had zero complaints about his food. His tortillas were thick enough to keep the taco from breaking from the juice of the meat. The rice was fluffy and full of flavor.   We were pleasantly surprised when we received the bill to find that the waiter did not charge us for everything we  ordered. The staff was on point, the food was on point, and as always we were very pleased. We will be back!! Oh...... move to the NW side of town you are too far away from us! That's my one complaint haha.",

I've been to other Mexican restaurants but this one just makes me want to come back for more.   The service is great. When we go there we try to go during happy hour. I always have to order the Ceviche, Street tacos (carne asada, carnitas and pastor), sopitos and Toreados con chorizo. The hubs just shares with me but like to order the guacamole and chips. But the drinks oh man I get the Paloma and margarita.  The hubs get the beer. The tacos are delish, reminds me of LA taco trucks. Love the home made sopitos.  It is made in house which is amazing. The Treados con chorizo is good but I think I would rather just have cheese but then that would be called Chili Relleno. Good stuff this place has. With great happy hour price can't beat that for Mexican food.",

For food I've tried the Albondigas Soup,Chips,Salsa and Bean dip The Albondigas soup here tastes great with perfect Meatballs! Tip: make sure to ask for the sides that go with it if your ordering to go, which are Spanish Rice, chopped Onions and Cilantro and sliced limes it's great for hangovers.  I liked the free Bean dip and Chips but the salsa had a chemical taste that was off putting maybe the salsa bowl wasn't cleaned properly.  I gave only 3 stars because of slow service and the Salsa...both times I've come here the Bartender was working hard, but overwhelmed with trying to keep up on drink/food orders, they were working so hard it was near impossible to get my to-go soup order in and later to pay my bill.   I wasted a good 30 minutes waiting, because the bartender who was working as fast as possible was just simply overwhelmed with other chores and kept ignoring my trying to get her attention.  Tip to Owner: maybe 2 Bartenders during peak business times would lessen customer frustration.",

    "text": "I have passed by this location many times and they always have a nice crowd. Tonight, we decided to try out Bonito for my birthday dinner. The atmosphere was authentic and our server was very helpful.  I had the chorizo tacos, which were filled with their homemade chorizo and served with rice, beans, and a scoop of guacamole. Their chorizo was good, not too spicy, but smoky. My partner got a combination platter with a chile relleno, taco, and enchilada. He said everything was good as well.  This location offered a free house margarita for checking in for Yelp users. The drink was actually very good and I ordered another. I did notice they only give each table one complimentary chips/salsa/beans starter and charging $3.50 for additional refills. I have to say I've never encountered this, even at more upscale restaurants.  The beans served were good, the salsa a little too smoky for me.  All in all, Bonito offered an authentic Mexican dinner for my birthday this year. There was a nice live band performing and the service was very good. We will more than likely be back to try some other options.",

The chips, salsa, and beans they offer as soon as you sit down are always so delicious that I have to limit myself lest I spoil my appetite (I'm not fancy - I've just always wanted to say \"lest\"). If I'm particularly hungry I order the Nopalitos as an appetizer. I absolutely love cactus and the way that it's cooked with onions and peppers is amazing and it's healthy!  I've had the shrimp cocktail, which has never let me down. The shrimp ceviche is one of my favorites as well. On hangover days I like to go in and get the Fideo soup (I have tried the menudo - I wasn't a fan). And nothing cures a hangover like a Michelada! The ones offered here never disappoint! The margaritas are also very good, as well as the Corona Margaritas, but the mixed drinks I've found are way too strong.  The one dish that I actually had to send back was the Mole. Call me spoiled but once you've tried my mom's mole, nothing compares. Mine was too sweet and the meat was too chewy. I sent it back and got a shrimp cocktail.  I guess this place just depends on your taste. Amazing for something things, not so great for others. Try it anyway.",

Quite frankly, our dinner and the service were an embarrassment.  Watch yourself, Bonito.  There are too many excellent Mexican restaurants in Vegas.

The food was so flavorful and well seasoned that I didn't need any salsa!!!   The salsa is actually my only issue. It lacked flavor, and was a little too spicy for me and they only have spicier salsa, so I was a bit disappointed that my request for Pico de Gallo was turned down, but if spicy is your thing then this place will hit the spot!

For starters, complimentary fresh fried tortilla chips are served with warm bean dip and red salsa or you can request for the spicier habanero salsa which I love. They also give you a complimentary small bowl of fideo soup to wet your appetite. For appetizers, we ordered the beef sopitos which were very juicy and delicious topped with guacamole and sour cream. If you checkin with your Yelp account, they give you a free margarita! I always end up getting full just from the the complimentary appetizers, so save room for the delicious entrees.   For dinner we ordered the Carnitas Michoacanas and the Chicken Mole Poblano. The carnitas were cooked in spices and were very succulent and tasty. They are served with a green salsa and a spicy charred jalapeno, yum! The chicken mole poblano was juicy and served smothered in a flavorful, mildly spicy and sweet brown mole sauce, so good! Both entrees are served with Mexican rice and warm beans topped with cheese.  Also all of the entrees come with freshly made corn or flour tortillas that are warm and delicious. We always leave here stuffed, satisfied and with leftovers because the portions are huge!",

We got our food and our drinks and our soup never showed up. Then 3 good looking girls sit at the table next to us and they got their soup and drinks before they ordered. And its sad because I thought this was a family restaurant but I guess we have to be young and sexy to get better service.",

Sure, sure, Lindo has the spectacular views and what not, and their food is decent but all of that gets cancelled out when you're in a packed and noisy (super kid friendly) restaurant. Moving right along..  Back to Bonito!  Greeted by a friendly gentleman and escorted to our table, my eyes scanned the room to observe the typical, I mean traditional Mexican themed decor; vibrant colors, cheesy artwork, and no Mexican restaurant would be complete without \"football\" on the telly. My party and I giggled at the music selection throughout our entire meal, it went from Latin Country, to Latin Classic Rock, and my all time favorite, Latin elevator music. I have saved the best for last though folks when it comes to the decor at good ol' Bonito Michoacan..THE MILLIONS OF CLOWNS EVERYWHERE!  What's up with clowns amigos? I just don't get how creepy clowns and puppets dangling from the ceiling tie in to delicious home made guacamole and sizzling, cooked to perfection fajitas. The clowns didn't sit well with me, but luckily their food did! (*round of applause from my stomach*)   In any event, this fine dining establishment earns 4-starts on the Kim-scale-o-food-places, the fifth lacking for, well, it's no real mystery here: the clown decor (ok and I don't fancy the location either).  Great job Bonito, I'm not positive you would be the first place I would pick should the mood for Mexican food strike again, but you're for sure in my top 5!",

    "text": "I've been eating at this place for years. Most of the waiters know us.  Tonight we decided to place a 'to go order' (despite of the fact that we have noticed some changes with the food for the worse), but still after a busy day I called them to place an order. BAD idea. It says on the menu (and online) that soup (a small cup with some very inexpensive pasta) is included with some meals (which ours qualified for), but was told on the phone that \"not on to go orders\". I talked to the person on the phone (and later on with the manager in person) but no change. Actually I don't understand why they have a manager.They have the containers, the soup and it should be included (they could NOT explain why it is not if you have it to go). The same for the small bean dip (also available only if you eat at the restaurant but not to go). However, the prices were the same (regardless if you ate there or at home), and expensive not only for the amount of the food but also for the poor quality. The flan that I used to like tasted like water and sugar. I have recommended this restaurant to many people and taken many friends to eat at this place. It is a shame to treat a regular customer like this. NOT coming back anymore and will make sure to tell everyone that it doesn't pay to go to a place that values a cheap cup of soup over customer's loyalty.",

I'm on a loose sort of \"diet\" (very strong word), I'm really trying to avoid Mexican food joints as they are very hard to eat semi-healthy at.   As I stared hard at the menu searching desparately for something I could call \"diet\".. I did notice they have a diet section, but all the food sounded bland and too well diety for my taste. I decided to try the lunch special called chicken #9 ($9.99 with soda). It rocked! It was chicken marinated in garlic, spices, chilis and it was full of flavor but light on the spice (just my style). It was served with guac, rice, beans, and tortillas (hardly diet food, but just noting you could eat this as a full calorie dish as you desire). Some of the best grilled chicken I've had in awhile... yay for a mexicn place that has something on the menu not full of lard !",

    "text": "Came here for dinner unexpectedly on a Friday night. Not the first time i've came here but this was the first time i've brought my mother to something like this. Since we were only a party of two, we were sat at a booth in front of the bar to the left.   Lighting was pretty dim with live music being played. The kind of environment you'd expect on a Friday night ! Pretty nice.   As this was only the 2nd time i've been here, their overwhelming menu was pretty hard to make a decision with. We were given their fresh tortilla chips, bean dip and salsa pretty quickly. Besides that, it was an easy decision to order a Mangonada margarita. What a delicious drink this is ! Definitely not the first time i've had this either ! Quite yummy drink. I couldn't really taste the alcohol but my mom said she could. Definitely a dangerous drink with majority of the alcohol taste being masked by the mango.   It's been a long time since my mom's had anything mexican so she'd become a bit american and order fajitas (apparently fajitas aren't genuine mexican cuisine but a Tex-Mex ! gasp !   Fajitas de res (Strips of New York steak mixed with tomato, onions, peppers, cilantro, and spices. With guacamole and sour cream. Served sizzling) - Very simple dish served with a choice of flour or corn tortillas. Their tortillas are homemade and are completely different from anything i've ever had (.... even in mexico ! LOL). The flour tortilla is so fragrant and soft. Its so good ! The corn tortilla is actually... much finer and softer than i expected. You definitely can tell that its a corn tortilla but its like a flour and corn tortilla had a baby o.O?! The strips of NY steak with cooked veggies was simple and tasty. Though i expected the steak to be more tender, it was quite flavorful.   Aside from the fajita, i definitely had trouble deciding what else to order. Originally i was looking at something chicken or pork but mom suggested something shrimp. With 13 different dishes made with shrimp, i had asked our waitress on some recommendations. She had made 3 different recommendations, one creamy, one spicy, one with cognac.   Camarones Sarandeados \"Tia Esther\" - Large fresh Mexican gulf shrimp basted with sarandeado sauce with a rich selection of dried chiles and secret spices blended with a touch of mayonnaise  I do hope this is the dish we got. I actually forgot the name. As with all entrees, comes with rice and bean plate. The shrimp used was definitely LARGE, granted not many in quantity. The sauce used was a very delicious creamy sauce that was extremely tasty with the shrimp or mixed and eaten with the rice. Even my mom was like OMG THIS SAUCE IS SO GOOD ! I know for a fact we opt'ed for the \"spicy\" one. Spice wise, it was not spicy, very mildly. Granted we do love eating spicy but im sure its decent for even the not really spicy eater.   Service was mildly slow as it took a while to get our bill and pay, but it was near the end of the night so it wasn't that bad.  Overall, very yummy experience ! I just realized after looking at their menu online that they have lunch specials ! i wonder, size wise, how do they compare to the normal entrees?! I wanna try for lunch !",

Drinks were big ! I liked it! Our drink was around $9-10 for the big cup. My friend and I shared a special dish for $38. It included shrimp, chicken, and steak. I would have to say the price is pretty steep here for Mexican compared to other places I've been. Our food was good but it didn't come with rice or veggies/beans but it did come with cheese. Everyone loves cheese. I would say the dish was good but for $38, I would have probably ordered something else. The restaurant is too dark inside. I would recommend them making it a little bit more lighter inside to see the food and menu.",

Bright colors, facade of a Mexican balcony overlooking main area.  Great family location.    Service: 5 stars - super friendly staff.    Food: 3 stars.  Food was just Ok.  Guac (made at table) was pretty basic, not worth the table-side service preparation.  We ordered a few apps (cactus plant thing, mango salad) and both were just OK.  Ordered their signature enchilada but wasn't super special or flavorful.  My brother ordered shrimp fajitas and enjoyed a flavorful sauce.   Wanted to love the food because service was so attentive, friendly and sweet, but just couldn't give more than 3 stars.",

    "text": "The atmosphere here is like a family restaurant, but larger and with lots of people. Very colorful rooms. Mexican art and sculptures on the walls. The menu has lots of authentic Mexican choices. Almost makes you feel like you're in Mexico.  Before the meal, chips, salsa, and refried beans were provided. I expected the salsa to be a little spicier but was rather mild. The refried bean dip was a nice touch.  A small bowl of Sopa de Fideo was provided. Small thin noodles are served in a broth. Good.  For an appetizer I had a small Campechana, a seafood cocktail with shrimp, octopus, and oysters. The small size was plenty large enough and the seafood was all excellent. There is a Timo's Size that is larger than the 'large' size, which would be interesting to see, if not so much to eat because of the size. There was a small amount of cilantro and spice but it was very mild. A bottle of Tapatio hot sauce was provided so one can spice it up to a hotter level if one wants. A bottle of ketchup was also provided, which is something I didn't expect, or use.  There are a lot of entrees to choose from and I selected one of the dozen-and-a-half seafood items, the Pescado A La Vallarta. A fillet of Orange Roughy is pan-fried. An orange roughy fish is orange colored but the fillet is more white colored. The taste of the fish was very mild, which is normal. There were olives, green peppers, and red peppers plenty. On the side of the plate was Spanish rice, average, Refried Beans with cheese, very good, and some guacamole, also very good.  A nice filling meal with a touch of different options not found in corporate-style Mexican restaurants.",

    "text": "Everything started out so well! We were greeted straight away, seated at a cute little booth and given some water while we looked over the drinks menu. Looking around the restaurant, it's got a lot of decor that represents Hispanic culture, even down to the art on the backs of the chairs - super cute and interesting. I ordered the pina colada cocktail and my partner had some fancy beer/tomato juice thing. No idea of the name, but it looked impressive and he liked it. I LOVED mine! It was made fresh and was one of the best PC's I've had! I could taste the rum but it wasn't too strong. We were also given some chips and beans which was a nice touch and my partner ordered the ceviche appetiser while we looked over the entrees. Now, here is where it goes downhill.. firstly, the entrees spanned about 5 pages. There were too many options and too much going on. My thought was: 'how can they make each dish so delicious and impressive if there is so much going on in the kitchen?' Well, in a word (or 2), they don't. My partner went for the steak burrito. It was generous with the condiments and was filled, however the meat was a little chewy and pretty tasteless in itself, would have been nice to have been seasoned. I went for one of the fish dishes- the playa azul. NOT what I was expecting for an $18 dish when it arrived. When the server put the dish down, he had to be careful as the plate was just swimming in thick sauce. There was not much in the way of fish. When I tasted it, it did melt in the mouth, although unfortunately, all I could taste was this very thick and gloopey red sauce. The rice was dry and tasted reheated with little shrivelled peas hiding amongst it, the tortilla that came with it was also too dry (thank goodness for all the sauce to soften it I suppose). After about 6 mouthfuls, I'd had enough of all the stodginess and boxed what was left of the fish to attempt again later.  Such a letdown because the vibe was lovely, the drinks were amazing and the appetiser was great, but the entree reminded me of what I used to get given for my school dinners. Not a restaurant dish at all! I think I'll come here again for some drinks before heading somewhere else for some dinner next time. So disappointing!",

We had the cerviche and shrimp cocktail for appetizers and they were both awesome.  I wanted street tacos but I guess that's only during happy hour but the tacos I had were decent. I really enjoyed a much needed Michelada as well! Our sever was really great, I'm kicking myself since I can't recall his name (blame the memory issue on the 1 Michelada) but it was like he knew what I needed just before I asked for it. We will be back and I'm very happy to see that the quality of food or device hasn't gone down over the years! Gracias!!",

We were seated immediately and our very gregarious, personable waiter took excellent care of us from beginning to end.    The margaritas had plenty of authority; the warm chips and salsa delicious.  Apparently, every entree includes a small cup of chicken-broth-style soup, which had a nice flavor.  We didn't see our favorite thing on the menu--a fajita combo of steak, chicken, and shrimp--but we asked and they gladly made it for us.  It was perfect, with just the right amount of char, served on a sizzling platter.  The rice was flavored superbly and the guacamole fresh and creamy.    My only complaint is the lighting:  It glares just a bit, and could be solved easily and inexpensively with dimmer switches.",

The chips are normal, the salsa is non-offensive, even the salsa that was supposed to be 'hot' wasn't any different that a typical jarred salsa. Refried beans with lard, orange rice with frozen veggies in it.. you get the picture. Nothing that would drive you back there. The prices are ok - we had 4 adults and 2 kids eat for $110, which included 2 beers and 2 margaritas.  Those margaritas are pre-blended. - pretty gross really. However, we sat at the bar waiting for our party and they pour a serious shot, so order tequila and hope for the best. Even though it is off the strip, its not authentic by any means.",

I took my time looking throught the entire menu, trying to figure our what i wanted to eat since everything sounded so good. I decided to go with the Mar y Tierra (Surf and Turf) since I was able to order from any of their shrip dishes and NY steak dishes! Best decision ever.

Thank God they gave directions to this place. Being from San Antonio tx I like tex mex food. Was this a pleasant surprise as soon as we walked in. I really liked the sopa de fideo to start with. Then the chips with salsa and very good re fried beans in a small bowl. Settled on chicken enchiladas with white sauce . Must not have liked it because I don't remember it being very good. Service was great. Ordered guacamole and they fixed it at the table for you. Very good. Was not crowded since it was Sunday before noon. Did not like being in a cramp place. There were five of us. Also used the womens bathroom they ran out of paper towels. Told waitress and a very nice lady and gentleman talking to her offered me their napkins. Waitress didn't know what to do.we were there in April. But overall the food was very good. I will go back next time in Vegas.we had been looking for a good place every time we are there.",

The salsa was hot......ouch, but not for my partner who devoured the bowl!  Seconds followed and so did our waiter to take our drink order. I had a mojeto.........pardon my spelling. It was tall, cool and refreshing. This was laden mint leaves and plenty of alcohol. While waited for food, a DJ played some funky 70s tunes with Mexican music, we laughed and thought it was cool.  Our food was good, nothing out of the ordinary...I had the shrimp sauteed in a cream sauce with lots garlic which I love.

She was working our table, 12 people and a few others that were 2-4 people and she didnt miss a beat.  The food was good. The albondigas soup was awesome. Im kinda plain when it comes to ordering, so I had myself a couple shredded beef tacos with some rice.  The beef was seasoned nicely and was a lil too tender for my liking, but good for the most part.  The atmosphere is great. They do karaoke(or at least i hope it was karaoke, not a band) when it gets a lil later into the evening.",

I have to confess:  I have never been a fan of Mexican food until I discovered this place and Lindo Michoacan - also in Vegas city.  Admittedly, the only Mexican food I've had has been in Toronto and ... well, need I say more.  Everything at this place is good.  They even prepared (complimentary) table side guac. for us.  OMG the freshness of the ingredients is unsurpassed.  They have traditional Mexican food like pozole (one of my favourites) and chicken with wine and prunes.  I salivate just thinking about the place.  Spouse loves the chicken verde as well.  The freshness of the ingredients ... tomatillos that were not out of a can ... indescribable.  The refried beans is like silk going down.  One of my all time favourite restaurants ever.  The owners are truly nice guys who really make one feel at home.  Go there.  Tell them I sent you.",

It was coated with a delicious green sauce that was superb for the carnitas!  The tortillas were thinner that what I was use to but they were homemade. Being different made it better!! The tortillas were also larger than the normal corn tortillas.  I LOVE BEANS! So it was a plus that they gave SALSA and BEANS with our chips at the beginning of our meal.  For all you clown-a-phobics, do not go here! There is clowns galore near the bathroom. If you go, you'll know what I mean.",

    "text": "Just finished having dinner for the first time at this restaurant after driving by it for so many years!  Well, we could kick ourselves for not stopping in before.   I ordered the Chile Rellenos Camerones, which were 2 mild green peppers stuffed with shrimp and topped with cheese. They were really tasty and the shrimp tasted fresh and not like they've been sitting in the fridge for a week.  This entree came with tortillas (corn or my choice, flour) freshly made on-site.  Curiously though, as many homemade tortillas I have eaten in my life, these got really stiff, pasty and cracker like once they got cold.  The wife had the Sopes with Carne Asadas which she enjoyed.  Our sons enjoyed a cheese quisadilla and the other, a cheeseburger and fires, which were really good.  All entrees came with a really good fideo soup.    Service was really good.  The only hiccup came at the end.  At the beginning of the meal (when we were ordering) I presented our 20% off coupon from our local newspaper that was valid Sun-Fri.  Our server told us he would deduct the discount when he brought our bill at the end of the meal and placed the coupon in his shirt pocket.  I made a silent bet with myself that the bill would not reflect the discount because the server was going to worry we would not tip him appropriately.  My wife and I are not those kind of tippers.  If they are good they will always get 20% from us and if there is a discounted amount, they always get the pre-discount amount for a tip, but we know there's a lot of people who don't practice this but to each their own.  Anyways, we finally got the bill adjusted and left, happy.  We'll definitely be returning here and bring out of town family and friends here also, since El Patron closed.  This place is a lot cheaper than Lindo in HD, whose parking lot also sucks!",

We could not taste any liquor in the drink,  and noticed other folks paying for their drinks had full size glasses. We've been traveling the southwest (new mexico, arizona, california and west tx) for a month eating at a different Mexican restaurant every day and this place is nothing out of the ordinary. The flour tortillas tasted store bought and the green chili verde was gross, pork rubbery not falling apart like we are used to. The chips, salsa and bean dip are served complimentary, but did not wow us. Our server Lorenzo was arrogant and acted as if we inconvenienced him. Worst food we have had in a month. We will not be back. Go to Yuma or Tucson for some really great authentic Mexican cuisine.",

One weird thing, either the seats at the booths were low, or the tables were high (or both...) but when I sat down the table was noticeably higher than a normal table...but I'm short.  This was some delicious food.  We got the tableside guacamole (made fresh, to order, pretty good, but no tomatoes) and it was quite an amount, more than most other sides of guacamole I've gotten.  We (me and three guys with appetites) didn't even finish it.  Of course, that may have had something to do with the HUGE portions that came our way.  One of the guys got fajitas (I think shrimp) and all his fixin's took up a full third of the table.  I got nachos with carne asada...mmmmmm.  A huge plate, piled high.  I think I only got through a third of it before collapsing.  After lunch (lunch at 4:30...this is what happens when you wake up at noon...) we went down to Fremont Street for a couple hours, and even nachos after fours hours sitting in a car were soooo goood....",

My ears are usually bleeding from this stupid tradition they have. They need to get rid of this ritual. The greatest waiter they have is Julio, professional, attentive, excellent personality. There is another waiter to avoid, he usually works nights, he is loud and obnoxious and should be selling used cars somewhere, I don't know his name but would give it if I did!

Salsa for chips was like frozen salsa they just microwave. Michelada was a joke.  He had some enchiladas with side of steak which he requested to be medium rare. I had some sort of fried fish.  The enchiladas were dry and nothing like what the pictures showed. He was so disappointed.  The fish was just like any other fish... left some weird feeling after eating but overall I didn't enjoy it. You would think this place is in some way representing Michoacan and the food would taste good in a authentic way. WRONG!!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!",

There is often times a mariachi band inside, filling the room with romantic ballads. Usually we get a platter of grilled meat and seafood, unless we want some of their quesadillas, caldos, and other dishes. Their torillas are handmade, very delicious with either soups or carne. Don't forget to save room for dessert (if your not full by the main course that is).",

The spot is sooo cute and colorful with high ceilings which is a plus because it doesn't make the place feel all stuffy. I tried the enchiladas Michoacanas and they are a MUST the sauce is sooo tasty full of flavor a tiny bit spicy but it's perfect. Please please try it lol. All the main dishes come with fideo soup that tasted homemade just like the one my momma makes :) my friend had the ceviche de Camaron she disliked it she feels it needed more flavor by the look of her face i can tell she didn't enjoy it one bit. But overall the place was great at least my dish :) oh an their agua de horchata is very good tooooo",

Hubby and I really enjoy the Oyster with ceviche on top (they are not stingy with the shrimp).  We do birthday dinners here ALL the times because we love the atmosphere.  For birthdays the waiters and waitress get together and do a band like show for the birthday person, love it! Thank you guys for a pleasant experience we will see you soon",

I look so forward to the chips, salsa, and bean dip that is served when you are seated. Usually it is AMAZING and I dive in like a maniac! Today the beans were hard and dry, just not good at all. Chips and salsa were still good though..... just a bad day for the beans I guess.  Today, my husband and I shared the Parrillada de Marisco. A huge platter of shrimp, crab, fish, and rice. A very good value for $45.  There was shrimp prepared different ways, butterflied and fried (which was very tasty) bacon wrapped (wasn't my absolute favorite) shrimp in enchilada sauce (very good, especially when eaten with the fabulous rice in the center of the platter) There was not a lot of crab. One bunch of snow crab legs... they were nice and sweet though.  A large Tilapia filet in a butter sauce, which was very good.  Wonderful creamy rice piled right in the center of the tray. Then on the side they serve an amazing queso and warm fresh homemade tortillas!  We accompanied our Parrillada de Marisco feast with a couple of shots of tequila, 1942 and it was FABULOUS!!! Pricey tequila shots, but good!!!",

Comparatively speaking, this is one of the best eateries I've encountered in a long time. The chili verde was like mom used to make. The complimentary appetizer \"sopa\" was excellent, and the margaritas were great as well. I look forward to frequenting this establishment and work my way through the menu.",

They come quickly, taste fantastic, and are plentiful.  Service is also great - I found it hard to reach the bottom of my glass before refills, waiters were (sincerely) friendly, etc.  Soon after ordering they brought an appetizer of spaghetti soup(?) which was way too salty for my taste.  I had ordered the fajita, which was just okay. The beans/rice/guac that came with were high quality but pretty sparse. It came with some pretty amazing flour tortillas though, which really carried the meal.  Flan topped off my lunch here for dessert. It was definitely too sweet and soft for my taste, but was edible.",

With chips, salsa and beans with water. The drinks was very good. The menu selection made very difficult to choose. Food was very good, our group ordered different things so we can taste from each plate. The service staff was excellent and attentive. Most definitely come back here again.",

I didn't touch the free chips I wasn't served soup because of course I wasn't hungry and I wasn't there to eat. But the one thing I did ask for was water. WATER THAT IS FREE & I get very dehydrated especially because am pregnant. & not only was there multiple times the waiters offered to refill my boyfriends soda and not my water. Am over here chewing ice , chewing my boyfriends sodas ice,  while they  keep only offering him refills my boy friend then tells the waiter to bring me another glass of water. & THEY NEVER BROUGHT ME A GLASS OF WATER. WORST PLACE TO COME TOO IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO EAT THERE THE EMPLOYEES TREAT YOU LIKE SHIT.  VERY DISAPPOINTED ON HOW A GLASS OF WATER WAS TOO MUCH TOO ASK FOR.",

I feel like people who don't know what real Mexican food is are the same people who gave it 5 stars. The food looked presentable but taste wise, it wasn't close Mexican food. On top of that, it was pretty expensive. Save your money, go eat somewhere that's worth paying  for",

I visited this place mid November and I didn't know what I wanted to eat for breakfast. It was already passed 10am when I realized that McDonald's would stop serving breakfast at 10:30am! I decided to google some Mexican restaurants and voila'! This place is close to the Las Vegas new strip. I had the machacado plate and he had the chorizo with cheese plate. Everything was great, the customer service and the price. I will definitively be coming back here every chance I can when in town. I am from Texas and it's sad to say the food here is better than some places back home. Now, you know!

We didn't like him btw.   Other than that it was amazing! My bday surprise my bf got me was fantastic! Maybe mariachi every night would be nice.",

This place serves you chips with beans and salsa to start and their re-fried beans are amazing delicious.  When I ordered my food I had to ask for another side of re-fried beans.  I tried their Green Chicken Enchiladas, the sauce was not spicy at all which is a plus, because if the food is too spicy where you can't even enjoy it that's not a good experience.  I got 2 enchiladas with rice and beans and that was enough to fill me up, I wasn't left hungry or over full either.  My family members ate the Shrimp Ceviche Tostadas, I tried one of these and they were amazing.  This place was a good pick, they had music, great tasting food, the price was right, the atmosphere was nice and the servers were very fast and nice.",

We stood awkwardly waiting while people piled in doing the same.   Got seated in a cute booth. Fun decor. Lighting hurts. Ceiling fans make for a strange strobe light effect. Maybe a special for Halloween?   Service is terrible - possibly the worst in Vegas. Our \"server\" was Israel (so says our receipt). Forever to greet us. We probably were 1/3 way done with complimentary chips (the salsa is hot, the bean dip with is excellent) before he remembered to ask someone to bring water to our table. We ordered cocktails. They came out separately. By about ten minutes.   Ordered an appetizer (ceviche - pretty okay). Israel came by to ask for our entree order. We said we wanted to wait for our appetizer before we ordered our entrees. It had been a while. He gives us an \"oh yeah!\" Guess he forgot that too.   Ordered our meals. A table sat down after us. They got the included soup and chip refills AND entrees before us. We had to ask for included soup - from I'm assuming a food runner - he was hustling though!   Our busboy had our meals boxed for us before Israel came by to see how they were.   Food was okay (pollo al cognac). Not worth going back for, when such terrible, neglectful service is \"provided\". Definitely not worth the price though.   However, shout out to Domingo, our hardworking busboy who kept our water full and table clean. The server could learn a thing or seven from his work ethic and care for guests.   Sucks it's so close to home, but I'd say it's worth the drive for ANY (maybe even Bell of Taco) other mexican food in the area.",

Since my plate went back to the kitchen multiple times and reheated the enchilada, beans and rice were over cooked.

But they get a nice bump by ordering the table-made guacamole. Order how you like and enjoy, very tasty.   The lunch specials are great. Chicken is made well and the fajitas are always a good option.  For those wanting a different flavor to life, try the Coca Cola carnitas. A truly different flavor to Carnitas. A great mole-ish sauce with the flavor of coke.   Home made tortillas also sets this place apart.   Try the food, especially some of their specialty dishes. You might be surprised by some new tastes.   My only issue with the place, is with their iced tea. It is not great. Either the machine is broken or the filter is not great, but the flavor of the tea is not great. This is a recent development. It used to be clean and refreshing. I hope they fix it or replace.",

As soon as you sit down someone greets you immediately with water, chips, Salsa, and warm bean dip. The portions are very generous and the drinks are delicious.  I highly recommend.",

    "text": "Awesome Mexican Food We come to Las Vegas 2-4 times a year. When we do, we try and find hidden gems away from the hotel/casino's. This trip it was Michoacan Gourmet Mexican. Turned out to be great choice.  Located on the corner of Decatur and Twain, north of Flamingo, the place has a classic Mexican restaurant feel to it. We made reservations for 5:30 and arrived just a bit early. While it wasn't jammed at that point, when we left at about 6:45 the place was full and they had a full lobby waiting. So, reservations are strongly suggested.   Food was outstanding, In our party of five we had two orders of Fajitas de Pollo (so much food that honestly two could have shared one order), the Mole Poblano (raved about), and a couple of combinations. All orders come with a cup of sopa de fideo which was a nice light start, plus the proverbial chips and salsa/beans. You can also order. You can also order their fresh guacamole which is made table side. We didn't and after tables all around us did, we regret not doing so.  All the food was great. Service was good-to-very good. The busboy (Ivan I think) was outstanding in refills of drinks and being present for any request. The server was pleasant but not as attentive. However, as mentioned before they were busy so no worries. It was a great leisurely meal with friends, one that we'll definitely visit again for.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d423020-r657703826-Michoacan_Gourmet_Mexican-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=2c7579589bdacfaa90c64ce98ba361aea5a776add35a281413aede259e6e4985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

My dad found this place online and we decided to try it. My family is from Michoacan and the menu looked solid. We started with coffee and it was PERFECT. We each ordered what we wanted and then they came out with complimentary Fedeo! My most favorite comfort food! If I had to choose a last meal, it would be Fedeo and when they brought them out, the whole table perked up and got so excited. It was PERFECT! So they bring out the entrees and we realize that we got used to the smaller portion sizes of the strip and these plates were giant lol. I ordered the chilaquiles with salsa verde and carne asada on top. The waiter asked me if I wanted eggs and I was like \"sure why not!?\" Then I saw the plate and it was a mountain of food lol! I've never had chilaquiles with carne asada on top and now I can't imagine it any other way! I built every bite with chiliquile, carne, and egg and it was PERFECT! My parents loved the menudo and to top it all off... they passed my only test... PERFECT horchata! It didn't need to be watered down and there was zero pulp! The music is PERFECT. The space is PERFECT! And the staff is even more PERFECT and welcoming! We found our new favorite hangover spot in Vegas! I can't wait to come back!",

Whoops, I've become such a taco-snob. \"No thanks\", I replied more politely. \"But can I please get onions, cilantro, and salsa for them?\"   At that he half-grimaced back at me with a silent HUH? \"Chure, ob course.\" ...aaand then they forgot the toppings when my tacos came out...   2   S T A R S  * FOUND THE TACO GEM! Never fails -- every place has an unexpected taco-gem. The joy of a Taco Flight is that sweet moment of discovering the stand-out. \"JUREKA!\" :::: Raja Con Crema Taco -- MEXCELLENT! Slices of poblano peppers and steak bathed in a creamy mushroom sauce, and served in a fresh tortilla. Every bite was moist and delicious!!  :::: Fried Fish Taco -- DECENT. Crispy and fresh. Toppings could have been better, but nonetheless it elicited happiness. :::: Fresh Tortillas -- WOOT! :::: Consomme -- DECENT. Starter soup with tiny noodles.  * BIG, FESTIVE JOINT Bonito Michoacan is the prototypical, fun-for-the-whole-family, Mexican-American restaurant. It's got the hostess in bright, ethnic dress, southwestern colors and faux-adobe walls, mariachis selling songs, a photographer selling photos of the dining parties. No cheesy sombreros, so a little dignity is preserved.  3   M I N U S E S  - TERRIBLE MEATS :::: Carnitas Taco -- MEH! Soo dry! They forgot the toppings. SKIP! :::: Asada Taco -- BLEH! Flavorless beef. Basically inedible. SKIP!! :::: Steak Picado -- TRASH! My buddy's steak was just disgusting. Dry, worst cut of the cow, tasted like meat-cardboard. :::: Rice -- AVERAGE.  - EXPENSIVE!! Dude! $28 for 2 average margaritas?? $18 for a plate of STEAK TRAGEDY??  - DISCRIMINATION? My dining buddy watched the restaurant photographer go from table to table, taking nice pics of the customers and offering to sell them prints. Our table, which featured the only Black man in the restaurant (not me), was ignored. Hmm... The photographer came back a few minutes later and skipped us again. Coulda been nothing, but the double cold-shoulder left a taste in our mouths almost as bad as the Steak Picado.",

My friend ordered the steak in coca-cola sauce which was good. I think if I end up going back here, I may order this dish. I liked the laid-back atmosphere of the restaurant and the prices were good as well.",

Everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their food-   For my Chile verde I substituted Lengua, and it was great. Their Utra Margarita is awesome though! 6 shots in a huge margarita glass you get to take home afterward. I can't belive I got through the whole thing! My fiance tried some of their cocktails which were just- eh, nothing special.  Go for the Tequila Margaritas you GRINGOS!  This is a fun place for classic mexican dishes. Ole!",

But, Boyfriend wanted Mexican food, so off we went!  This location is considerably less crowded than the others. We were seated immediately and had drinks within minutes. We ordered not long after that and were eating quickly. I noticed that the menu items are cheaper than at the other locations (combination meals average $11.99, as opposed to $14). The food was marginally better than other locations, I think.  I would love to go back to this location, though, because the service was phenomenal. Seriously, the best service I've ever had, ever.",

Our server was not only knowledgeable of gluten, but told me with confidence exactly what menu items were safe. It seems the make all tortillas, chips, etc fresh in their restaurant and possibly the dressings as well.   With a gf peace of mind, I enjoyed a beautiful spinach mango artichoke salad with sliced jicama and raspberry vinaigrette. The best, the BEST salad Ive ever had. That say a lot for a salad!!!  All of the five gentlemen in my group greatly enjoyed their meals as well, from the guacamole made table-side to the fajitas and other authentic dishes. Delicious, delicious food with knowledgeable servers in an authentic and clean environment. Check it out!!!",

We have been to the other location that got closed down (Viva Michoacan in Henderson). It took forever for them to take our order, the waiter forgot about my guacamole & sour cream, they forgot to refill my boyfriend's soda and my friend pronounced the very long Spanish word that supposedly earned him a free margarita...which they never brought.  Yes, I'm Mexican so let me say that the food is mediocre. I think you'd had better luck going to Pepe's Tacos down the street. The beans needed salt and. I felt that they were like Rosarito beans that you get from a can and just heat up. I don't understand why all their burritos are smothered in sauce and cheese. that's more of a enchilada...and if I wanted an enchilada I'd order one. A burrito is meant to be eaten with hands, not with a fork.",

    "text": "This place can get busy during weekends, so don't think they'll treat you any better when you come on a weekday. It's just as bad or even worse. My family and I came on a Thursday for my father's birthday. This place was not any where near busy. To start off we called ahead letting them know we had a party of six. Come to find out they had given away our table to someone else because they weren't sure which reservation was which. The ladies at the counter went back and forth about when they should seat us, and eventually did. We let them know we had a birthday there at the counter, and they said \"let the waiter know\". We sat down and discreetly let our waiter know about the birthday. We ordered our food and I for sure made it known that I didn't want any sort of pico de gallo on my dish (#6 on the menu). They still put it on there which made my dish worse than what it already tasted. Ordered two beers that took the waiter an extremely long time to get to the table. Had to ask another family member for a sip out of their own drink because of this. The food took a very long time to come out and no one enjoyed their food due to the plain taste it all had. The only thing that was enjoyable was the tiny fideo soup. We sat there twiddling our thumbs after everyone was finished eating waiting to see when they were going to come sing happy birthday (the only reason why we even chose to come here). We had to go let them know we were ready for it and no one came. Mind you there was nothing else to do besides sit there and wait awkwardly for them. We waited as long as we could. Noticed none of them were getting together for it.  Ended up getting up and walking to pay for our food and that's when they embarrassingly came up to us and said they were NOW ready. We let them, and it was extremely unpleasant and way more than just awkward. We were all already done with the whole experience. I will never bring one of my loved ones here for any sort of special occasion, or even for dinner alone and I will highly encourage anyone else to do the same!",

They have an extensive menu with a nice selection of seafood. I've tried the orange roughy and the camarones a la diabla but my go-to is the red snapper. It's a whole fish served fried or in garlic sauce with rice, salad and french fires. You can sub for beans or veggies. I usually do, it just doesn't feel like fries are the best option for this meal.  The guac is good and they serve a habanero salsa with a nice kick. It's not the standard salsa that comes to the table with the chips and bean dip, but if you request it they are happy to comply. There are no taps at the bar and the bottle selection is limited. The beer is not the main attraction at this bar, it's all about the margarita.",

I'm from LA and I still havent found a restaurant that comes close to this place.  Their drinks are also yummy!! We had a chamango type of drink...cant remember the name of it but if you see it, get it. We enjoyed the Mexican candy submerged in the drink too lol.   Give it a shot, its really delicious food.",

I did not like my food at all. Must say, Lindo Michoacan is a tad better. I had a steak dish that wasn't nothing great, and my girlfriend had shrimp in a paprika cream sauce.   It's a place I don't expect to ever return to sadly. Must say the cilantro margarita was refreshing but it's actually listed as a Jalapeno Cilantro margarita and I didn't pick up the pepper tone.  Just lacking sazon (Spanish for flavor). You get more great flavors at Lindo Michoacan and my favorite Mexican joint, Flaming Fajitas. Hope you have a much better experience then ours.",

Free refills on horchata was a bonus for him.  Fideo as a starter was a bonus for me and a first.  Delicious.  We decided on a combination plate because quite frankly we couldn't decide.  I had to special order and the waiter was happy to oblige.  Poblano chile relleno was the standard and just fine.  Mole enchilada was spicy just how I like it and the beef lengua was cooked to perfection.  That was my taco choice.  The flour tortillas were just like the ones you get in Mexico and I we ate them all.    The place was packed with several large parties which tells me it's a local favorite.  The service was great.  Everyone was so courteous and friendly.  A must visit when in Vegas.",

There were more than 25 of us on a family reunion and the servers went above and beyond to accommodate our family. Everything was perfect. They took care of each and everyone of us like 'Gold'. The service was impeccable. Yes we were a big bunch of fun loving ladies and we felt completely happy with the service. The service was awesome! We even had a pretty young girl who photographed us for our big group, and Im pretty sure we all bought the group photo that was offered to us at the end of the night for $10(good deal).   Two of the cousins had a birthday, and the staff came out in full form with a band, hats(for the birthday girls) and shots for them both!!!   Yes, this is Vegas! But, not many local establishments go out of their way to make everyone so comfortable and happy!  The food is amazing, I will not comment on 25 meals that were ordered, but I know everyone loved the food.  Thank you for being a place to dine that cares and looks after all needs of the customer! We all appreciate!   See you soon!",

The beans seemed average, the rice was good, and the hand made tortillas were also good. I had the Tamarindo Margarita and the Mango Margarita. Both were very good! Our server, Violeta was awesome!

    "text": "I have been to a few of the Michoacan restaurants before. I feel it is safe to say Bonita Michoacan is my favorite.   I came here with my family last weekend while they were visiting from out of town. They were told of Bonita Michoacan by a waiter they met at an IHOP who also works here also.  We were seated quickly upon arrival even though it was a Friday evening and we were a party of five in this busy restaurant. We did not have to wait long before chips and salsa were brought out. Then we were also brought the sopa de fideo as is customary at the Michoacan restaurants. As were were looking over the menu and munching on chips, we saw another table which had ordered the fresh guacamole. We thought it looked good and ordered it too. I'm glad we did. It was chunky, creamy, fresh and just the right level of spicy. That was a nice way to start our meal.  For my entree I ordered pollo al cognac. One bite and it quickly became my favorite chicken dish any where. The plate was huge as was the chicken breast though I could not really see the latter. It was a large breast grilled to perfection while maintaining tenderness then smothered in a sour cream sauce with mushrooms, onions and a touch of cognac. I am a sucker for sour cream and mushrooms so this was just awesome. I would go back and order that again for sure.  There are only a few small things I take issue with at Bonita Michoacan. They are the margaritas, the salsa, and the sopa. At least on this occasion. I ordered a house margarita and that is exactly what I got. My issue with it is that it taste like a premixed syrup like the ready made stuff in the grocery stores. It is very sweet and I don't care for that. The salsa was Ok. It had good spice but then there was a bitter after taste. Possibly from dried chilies being used. And finally the sopa was kind of salty. I realize it is soup and soup is salty. This was just a bit much for a couple of us in my party. Aside from those things that I'm just nagging about, this was a primo spot for dinner and we were all glad we tried it out.",

After checking in with my wife things didn't look so positive...they didn't have our table ready which was very frustrating! I gave them hours notice which in my opinion is totally their fault. I will say the staff was  very friendly and very apologetic about the situation. The managers even came out and bought our whole group a round of drinks and brought the kids lemeonades. Finally after a 25 minute wait we did get seated, but again the manager came over and gave us free table side guacamole and again apologized.  At this point no one remembers the wait my daughters could care less and everyone was having a good time. Our waiter Richard made my daughter feel really special and did an awesome job with her birthday. The food here was really good and everyone really enjoyed the atmosphere...would love to come back and enjoy this place again on a trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "Was in Vegas for a friend's birthday weekend and looking for a place to go eat brunch/lunch at and one of our friends mentioned Bonito Michoacan, we all thought it sounded great so off we went!  When I got there, I check in on my handy dandy Yelp App and guess what! Just checking in I scored a free margarita, how sweet is that!  But they also had a little text promo too that gave you a free margarita as well, so the table of 12 was already set with free margarita haha.  They start you off with homemade chips, bean dip & salsa, the bean dig is great, mix it with the salsa and it becomes amazing!  Just take note, 1st round of homemade chips, bean dip & salsa are complementary, additional orders are 2.99, but we were a party of 12 and there was plenty.  After checking out the menu I went with Zitacuaro - 2 enchiladas in a Verde sauce, I picked chicken for my meat, and I have to say these enchiladas were great, the corn tortilla I believe was homemade, it was perfectly cooked, the chicken was shredded and it was moist and very good tasting, however they season/marinade the chicken was delish! The Verde sauce was delish too! One of the best I have had, full of flavor and the perfect texture. These were some great enchiladas.  Service was great and friendly, glad to have found this lil gem in Vegas!",

I understand that at a restaurant there are other amenities, advantages, and portions are bigger, but on flavor and experience alone, is the mark up really worth it?  This place serves delicious Mexican food.  I have no complaints, service was professional, and friendly.  There is nothing wrong with this establishment.

    "text": "Went to dinner here last night for my birthday. We had previously eaten here in May, 2013. That time we enjoyed the meal very much and planned on going back again for a special occasion. This time in no way resembled the previous experience. I had the # 1 combination of chile rellenos, chicken enchilada, and a beef taco. The rellenos was covered in some generic tomato sauce and was bland tasting. The cheese was very stringy and tasteless. The enchilada was so-so and the beef taco was almost Inedible. Beef was dry and the taco shell was hard as a rock. My date had a green chile burrito that had big chunks of pork instead of shredded, the chicken taco also had big chunks of chicken instead of shredded, and her cheese enchilada was basically a tortilla rolled up with sauce and cheese on top. She didn't care for any of it. She also ordered sopapillas to be served with our meal, and they showed up 15 minutes after the entree. When we asked where they were the waitress said they were \"cooking them fresh\".The bean dip was also bland and the chips were stale. Being a Specialty Room Chef in Las Vegas for over 20 years, I know good food. My hunch is that management has sourced cheaper product to cut cost and the quality dropped immensely, or the kitchen staff totally changed and doesn't produce the same quality as the staff from last year's visit. Lastly the table in our booth wobbled and we felt like we were sitting way to low, with the table height up to chest level because of the worn out seating. Also the music could drop a few decibels. It's not a nightclub. Needless to say I would never go back. Chipotle or even Taco Bell would be a preferred dining choice.",

The avocado dip know as guacamole is very tasty but very high in calories. The cactus appetizer is very yummy served with either homemade flour or corn tortillas.  We first learn of this location on Cico De Mayo and have been back several times. One thing I must insist that you do not order are the tacos unless you want to become very disappointed like I did after ordering myself and my date at lunch a la carte two tacos and tostada de ceviche. Only the tacos were very small and fried with maybe a tablespoon and half of chicken and cheese combined and served over shredded lettuce.  These taco's looked like something you would generally avoid at Jack In-Box.",

I ordered the steak with cilantro and I am still dreaming about it 2 days later. It was tender and perfectly cooked. The drinks are great too, the mangoniada is a must try and the micheladas are amazing. This place is also really nice Inside and out, beautifully decorated!! This is a must in Vegas!!",

The green enchilada sauce is amazing, as well as the citrus marinated carnitas. I had some huevos con machaca tonight (breakfast for dinner!) and it was great! Oh! The flour (have not tried the corn yet) tortillas are very good.  Margaritas are made with fresh squeezed lime juice rather than a bottle or gun of sour mix. Very tasty. The chips are very disappointing and so is the salsa. This is the only reason I could not rate it 5 stars.  Service: This is some of the best service I've seen in a while. The staff (bus staff included) truly want to make sure that you have a great time and love every minute.  Atmosphere: While the typical Mexican restaurant theme is the basis for the atmosphere, it is done well and does not feel \"cheesy.\" Pretty quiet most of the time, but can get loud when busy (of course).  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "What can I say? Girlfriend wanted to go to a Mexican restaurant and heard some good reviews from some of my coworkers at work so I decided to give it a shot. Immediately we were greeted at the door and a booth was found for the two of us. We ordered our drinks, and then chips and bean dip and salsa (which we did not both particularly care for) sat in front of us. The fideo soup was simply amazing, and was complementary as well. She ordered the carnitas plate with beans and rice and guacamole. 10/10 for that. I ordered the Pollo Al Cognac. 10/10 has well. The carnitas was better in my opinion, but both dishes were extremely flavorful. We took our dessert home with us since after the beans, fideo soup, and our meal we were absolutely stuffed. I ordered the cheesecake burrito and she ordered flan. She said the Flan was good. I personally do not care for flan at all, so I did not try it.  Food - 10/10 Service - 8/10 (merely for the fact they sat the menu down in front of us and literally 20 seconds later asked us what we wanted. Made me feel slightly rushed) Atmosphere - 9/10 (the live music was a tad bit loud and sometimes I could not hear by date while she was talking to me)  I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for a good Mexican restaurant with decent prices and huge portion sizes.",

I came here with a co worker on a lunch break a little over a week ago. Greeting from the hostess was pleasant as well as the customer service from our waiter! Good we ordered was the tacos lengua(cow tongue) and my fish tacos! Everything tastes okay UNTIL I went to go eat my last tacos and noticed a baby ant hop off my plate O_o yeah and we all know ants just don't roll solo now do they? Know what this means right? There's clearly more and to what wasn't a surprise I glance over at the window seal and it's plenty more under this vase! YUCK! We immediately got our server who apologized and told us this wasn't likely well we decided to kill one of them and save it in a napkin for management and surely she came out thinking that it couldn't be possible.. She explained that they always clean very good.. Well apparently not because these ants been shacking up for a while. She apologized and gave us HALF off our bill which actually should've been completely comp'd and maybe even a gift certificate to try them again. After being grossed out I didn't even want a to-go box..not sure if i would've wanted anymore ants to bring home (a lot of pun intended)..",

The menu is extensive...but I'm only going to comment on what I had.  Fajitas. I ordered a mix of pork and beef. When they arrived they were sizzling hot but flavorless. It's sad when the bell peppers have more flavor than the meat. The only way I could tell the difference from the beef and the pork was that the pork looked like pulled pork -- and about that... isn't fajita meat typically grilled? It honestly looked like they threw some pulled pork on the sizzling plate and tried to pass it off on me.   The only plus was that the tortillas were freshly made.  I forgot what my friend ordered but when I asked him how his was he just shrugged his shoulders and said, \"It's ok I guess\".  The service was great and the waiters were very friendly. The salsa was \"ok\" and the bean dip that came with it was, well, bean dip...nothing \"addictive\" about it like I saw in another review.  The lounge singer they had was playing mostly songs from the 80s. 'I Just Called to Say I Love You' by Lionel Richie? C'mon, Man. I think he played 2 Mexican songs the whole time we were there. I personally think it was more annoying than entertaining but hey, maybe other people like that kinda stuff.  I probably won't be back because it simply wasn't worth it. Bland and ordinary.",

    "text": "My family and I went to this restaurant on Mother's Day so perhaps I am being biased as I know most restaurants are out of control on that particular date.  This was my experience: We had a group of 9 and got seated right away. That was initially impressive! Our waiter was a man named Lorenzo. We ordered drinks, got our chips and salsa/bean dip rather quickly. We ordered our food and from then on it was a 45+  minute wait to receive the food. I think I would have been okay with waiting on the food if I didn't notice that all other families that arrived after mine were brought their food right away. Small or larger groups everyone else's waiters were ON IT; however, ours was not. I finally could not stand it any longer and approached him to ask if he could bring our food as each plate was ready, versus waiting on all of them to be ready entirely. He seemed annoyed at my comment, but noticing how slow he was moving kept irritating me.  Once the food arrived, I was starved and shoved everything down. I had a combination plate with Huevos Rancheros. The hand made tortillas that came with the meal were a nice surprise. However, the rice was bland. My huevos rancheros had a weak red sauce with no flavor. I asked around the table, and the variety on our table had burritos and fish combo plates, yet they all agreed that each item was rather bland.   The alcoholic drink selection although not that large, was very good. I ordered something called \"Que Viva la Borrachera\" and I have to say that probably saved this entire rating. They packed on the alcohol!  I would consider this place for appetizers and drinks with a friend, but not for a meal.",

Chips, salsa and bean dip come to the table when you first sit down.  One of my favorite dishes here is their fajitas. Shrimp and/ or chicken. The tortillas are home made, you can't beat that! Fideo soup usually comes with an entree. I always add a little salsa for a kick.  If you're celebrating a birthday be sure to let them know. They'll come on over and sing in English & Spanish.

    "text": "4.5 stars  My family and I were introduced to this place by my in-laws.  They are regulars to this place, and it didn't take us long to see why.  This place has good food and good service.    The experience is started off with Chips & Salsa AND Bean Dip.  Chips are nice and fresh; not salty.  Salsa is usually good, but I love the bean dip!  The bean dip is excellent when enjoyed with the chips.  It is served warm and just melts in your mouth.    Our Entrees were just as good.  Some ofthe entrees that we ordered included a Chicken Flautas (my item), Chile Relleno / Beef Taco Combo, Lightly Breaded Thin Slice of Steak served with French Fries, etc.  although I feasted on the chips and bean dip, I was still able to feast on my Chicken Flautas.  They were nice and crispy (not oily) with juicy chicken pieces inside.  We also had the pleasure of ordering a large mango margarita.  Wow, it was definitely LARGE.  We even got to keep the margarita glass (rinsed clean thanks to our server).    Loved that they sang to my wife in celebration of her birthday!  A churro dessert was served as the birthday dessert.  To top that off, our server even had a shot of Tequila and Sprite to help commemorate the occasion.    Service was great!  Our server and team (food runners, etc.) did a great job.    Prices were also not too bad, especially considering we were there for dinner.",

And boy was he right.   Upon pulling up and seeing the parking lot was packed I got a little worried we would have to wait for a table but...NOPE. We were happily greeted by two pretty hostesses and taken to our table for 4. Our server arrived promptly, took our drink order, and even gave us a little free cup of their homemade guacamole (delicious!!!) after our chips and salsa arrived. It seemed we had multiple people waiting on us and making sure our drinks & chips were full. I appreciated that, a lot. Pretty cool that they were all having each others backs and truly their focus was on the guests dining experience.   We ordered different varieties of the usual Mexican flare so I won't go into details describing it all. Everything was delicious and we were all happy with our food.   One thing that I thought was pretty awesome and makes me want to go back for my birthday....they had a few people with birthdays while we were there. They make a HUGE spectacle with singing to you, complete with a sombrero and a free shot of tequila down the hatch!  Oh my gosh it was sooooo loud but ya know I didn't mind it, even though it wasn't for anyone at our table it was still fun to watch and even other guests joined in on singing the happy birthday. Pretty awesome!!!   Will definitely be back here :)",

I am vegetarian and didn't see much on the menu, So I decided just ordered a bean and rice burrito with some sides  (sour cream, pico De gallo) and some chicken tenders for my son. My boyfriend's dinner looked great but ours looked horrible. First, for my burrito looked like they just slapped down a cold tortilla with some cheap yellow (yes yellow) lettuce from the 99 cent store. It wasn't even presentable o could have made that myself at home for what they charged me. My son's dinner was just insulting. They came out with some fries and the chicken tenders  (which says they are homemade) , the chicken tenders were literally the little dinosaurs in the frozen aisle of the grocery store!! I ripped them open and they were still cold shaped exactly like the dinosaurs!!! It was ridiculous! So i told the waiter and he went to the back to see what's going on and he came back didn't apologize or anything he juat said would you like something else in place of this? I said no we do not want to pay for the tenders just the fries, he took it off the receipt. At least he did that. In any place, I will not be coming back to this place. It was the worse experience. If you bring your child please don't order off the kids menu , total rip off.",

What we received was extremely friendly service, a lot of delicious food, and they had like a 4 piece band sing happy birthday and gave our man of the hour a free shot of tequila.  I don't really see anything I could have criticized from our experience. We were seated promptly, treated well, and the food was surprisingly very delicious. Additionally, we stayed there for a good 40 minutes after their closing time and never felt rushed at all.  I had the steak cilantro, whilst the others around the table had an assortment of chimichanga, a crazy gigantic burrito, and chicken helena or something along those lines. Everything was cooked really well with rich strong flavors.  We also got the hand-made table side guacamole and it was extremely tasty and fresh.  All in all it was a very pleasant experience.",

Placed our order....then that's where it went downhill. There were 4 of us, and we ran out of chips and salsa and water quickly. There was no one anywhere to help us. So we sat and waited until another waiter (not the original nice one) came with our food. We asked for more water and more chips and salsa. He said he would be right back. After he left I noticed they didn't put ranch dressing on my salad like I had asked for. We sat, and sat, and sat....no one ever came back to refill our waters like we had asked, I still hadnt eaten since my salad was dry. I finally got up and went to the front and asked for all we had been waiting for for at least 30 min. Someone finally came with all the above. About 3/4 of the way thru the meal the original waiter came back and said he was sorry, that there was a party of 30 in the front and that he got caught up with them. We just asked for the check since we were afraid he would disappear for another 45 minutes again. Overall, it seemed like a fun place, and the food was good, but the lack of service and attention to the customer was enough to make me never come back.",

My friend told me this restaurant was good so i went there with my boyfriend for dinner. The decoration in the restaurant are quite special (looks like a normal house) and the staff are very nice and friendly. My friend told me the Steak Cilantro was good so I ordered this one and my boyfriend had the Coca cola steak. When my dish came, i could smell something bitter and i just didnt want to touch my dish so I switched mine with my boyfriend. So I had the Coca cola steak now, the sauce was nothing special and the steak was overcooked. The yellow rice which came with it was not really good. And my boyfriend didnt like the Steak Cilantro neither. Maybe we just do not like the authentic Mexican food and think we will stick back to Chipotle and cafe habana. People who like authentic Mexican food might wanna go there and try and see.",

I had the Sopes,  (Sopes -Three  handmade tortillas gorditas, lightly deep fried. Topped with chorizo, carne asada or pollo asado.) with carne asada a taco, basically, but with a  thicker, fried corn tortilla, complete with onions, cilantro, etc.  No sissy lettuce and tomato on these tacos.  It also came with beans and rice (some of the better rice I've had, I find it always to be dry and bland, but I like flavor) I finished 2 of them (out of the 3 I had), but couldn't handle eating anymore.  My boyfriend had a dish that was even better than mine.  I can't remember the name of it, but I'm waiting for him to answer me so I know what it is. - Now I know! It was the Steak Picado- (New York steak in small chunks, sauteed with onions, cilantro, jalapenos, tomatoes and mixed with Spanish & verde sauce.) I remember, it was nice chunks of meat in a red sauce (not mole, not chile colorado), I took a bite of it, and the meat was incredibly tender, not the dry, in the crockpot for 6 hours, shredded tender, the tender that only comes from a good piece of meat.  It yields slightly, but as soon as you bit in, it's pure, soft, moist bliss.  And no gristle!  Their handmade tortillas are also very, very good.  I watched the nice lady make tortillas the whole time I was there, she was a busy lady!   We finished it off with the fried ice cream.  To me, it left more to be desired.  The coating seemed...almost stale, it was hard to chew and the ice cream was just plain vanilla ice cream.  I heard the table next to us order the fried banana after the waiter's suggestion, they seemed satisfied with it and finished the whole thing.  All in all, I will definitely go here again, just on the Steak Picado alone.",

The atmosphere was great and everyone working there greeted us warmly and were very friendly throughout. There was a Mariachi band playing, but not too loud, and everything just felt comfortable. The decor was bright and festive, but it was not over the top. The thing that we noticed first was that almost everyone eating there was Latino, and that, to us, is always a good sign of authentic food. The food did not disappoint. Everything was so good overall that we came back the next day for lunch before heading back home-- just to get another taste of it. The best of what we tried: the oysters (I am not a fan but my husband ate the heck out of them happily), the cheese fundo, and the guacamole. The warm, homemade tortillas were the best tortillas I have ever had as well, and if I could somehow magically have them at my house every day, I would be eating a steady diet of them. All in all, a good value for the money, a nice experience, and wonderful food.",

I ordered the steak Fajitas.  They arrived on a cold plate, not sizzling like they normally do.  There were 9 small pieces of beef, three small pieces of onion and 3/4 of the Fajitas consisted of bell peppers.  The Fajitas were flavorless.  No seasoning, just cooked meat and peppers.  What a disappointment.  We noticed on the menu that if you want more chips and salsa, you must now pay $2.99 for them.  What a ripoff since the bowl of chips is small and was about  1/2 full.  Ricardo's is at the corner of Decatur and Flamingo and I hear it is better thanBointo Michoacan.",

    "text": "This was the second place we ate at while visiting LV(check my other reviews for into).  Coming from the San Francisco area, where good Mexican food is hard to find, this place was a step up with chips and great refried beans served right up, nice Mexican decor, and excellent service.  I started with their Cadillac Margarita with Patron Silver.  Nice size goblet and a nice buzz that lasted the meal.  My girlfriend ordered the \"Vampiro\" which tasted like slightly alcoholic cool aid.  We sent it back and immediately had it replace with a delicious pina colada.  I had read about their Chile Colorado, a new york cut into pieces in a red sauce(gringos need not worry about it being a spicy sauce) to which I added their flavorful spicy sauce and that did the trick.  I ordered the flour tortillas (I believe they are freshly made, as it tasted that way to me.)   My girlfriend ordered the Mexican combo beef taco, chicken enchilada,  and chile relleno ( The beef taco took first place, chili relleno second, I found it delicious on a taste test, and enchilada a distant third.  Finally, always in search for the authentic churro, it was done right served with small decorative flowered whip cream flowers to dip in.  It was crisp and not overly sweet.   Overall I give this place a B+, as their chili colorado good have been better, perhaps make it bit more flavorful.  Nevertheless, as Mexican restaurant goes from where I am from, this place any day.",

It starts out with soup that tasted like freeze-dried Lipton noodle soup. None of the 3 of us ate it. We took our waiter's recommendations, and although he was efficient, he was not right.  We ordered from the Specialities, and 1/3 was good: the camarones a la cognac. Booths were too short for the table. The live music-1 guy- was okay for free, but sang American songs, which did not contribute to the Mexican atmosphere. Subsequently, 2 of us went to El Nopal restaurant in Vegas, which was excellent, and proves Vegas does have good Mexican restaurants!",

The atmosphere is quaint, the service is friendly, and the food is phenomenal.Been searching for the best Mexican spot and I think we found it... the food had large portions and the live band was cool.. The pricing is affordable and although our waiter was useless the bus boy was great.. we are new yorkers so we know good service.. TABLESIDE GUACAMOLE IS THE BEST!!! & peach margaritas come with real peach slices, it's the best snack place!! Fish tacos weren't life changing though.Tableside guacamole that is so good. Ceviche was one of the best I have had. I thought the food was all good. Equivalent to lindo michoacan. The service was friendly.Bonito Michoacan really is a diamond in the rough out here on The West Side. It may not seem special on the outside, but the food inside is worth the drive.The enchiladas here actually do have taste. The chile relleno is also a good choice. I could even tell the salsa was homemade.It's good Mexican comfort food here, and the food shouldn't be disappointing.great mexican place good service, homemade tortillas, freh table side guacamole, good music, good margatitas! I am very pickey when it comes to Mexican food due to being of Mexican decent and enjoy finding the \"real thing\". Bonito Michoacan is The Real Thing.....love the food, atmosphere and the people. It's a great place to eat or just go and have their delicious margaritas.",

First of all the food is not flavorful, I had to put salt on everything from the salsa to the beans and every item on my plate.  I ordered a combo plate with a chile relleno, chicken enchilada and chicken taco.  The chicken did not have any flavor and was very dry.  The chile relleno was full of water and the sauce on it tastes like pure tomato sauce.  Overall, it was a horrible meal.  The best part about my dinner was the tableside guacamole which of course needed salt and the wait staff who were very attentive.",

The rice and beans were not good. The salsa was pretty good, had a good kick to it. It was okay, but definitely not the best I've had. Their menu is massive, which yields a lot of choices for groups. Standard is all I can say. And the booths are definitely not at a normal height.",

Our waitress recommended Carne Asadea for me because I was not so sure what steak dish I should get. The waitress' name is Liliana, she recommended an orange roughy dish for my mother. When our food came for my mom, my mom said,  this does not taste like orange roughy. My steak was a little bit overcooked it did not tasted like medium rare steak at all. But, the service from the bus boy was very nice. When we received our bill, I noticed that my mom's dish is really not roughy dish it's really , Filete D Tilap L/C. So, it was an interesting experience at this restaurant. We didn't want the rice in our dishes so we asked for vegetables instead, we were surprised that they added extra money for the vegetable. I think it was a lack of communication with the waitress. Anyways, we passed by this restaurant many, many times and we always say we were going to try this restaurant one day.  The food is nothing to brag about today but the service was wonderful.",

Tue salmon has great taste, the rice and beans have a lot of flavor and the shrimp is a must if you're a seafood person. I ordered \"Camarones Abuelito Timo\" which is shrimp wrapped in bacon, with melted cheese on top not to mention the shrimp were on top of the rice which gave it great flavor. I will definitely be coming back to try out more of their menu, it's a must if you're ever in Nevada.

We had shrimp ceviche, steak tacos entree and steak fajita. Everything was delicious. Complimentary chips and salsa are served as soon as you sit down. Rice, beans and soup come with most entrees. I checked in on Yelp and got a free Margarita which was also good and refreshing. The waiters were very nice, friendly and attentive. We really had a great experience at Bonito Michoacan tonight and will definitely come back.",

I also got the cactus appetizer which was super juicy and fresh, very large portion, too. My friend got the steak with rice and beans and the steak was super flavorful and tender.  The beans they serve have so much flavor and I ate them w chips over the salsa because the salsa gave me a crazy cough attack (I think a little bit of pepper was stuck in my throat) which was embarrassing and something I didn't want to happen again lol Also, the service was really good. We were laughing because I would ask for something and they would bring it two seconds later. We started to think they could read our minds!",

The hostess asked if we minded a booth in the bar area, which we didn't at all, and it was lively and fun! There was a live singer and our waitress/bartender was warm and friendly. I had a specialty concoction that she made for me which was a cucumber jalapeno margarita, and it was delicious and super spicy. For my meal I had the Chilaquiles with green sauce and scrambled eggs, and I saw there was an option to add chicken so I did. It was delicious however I would leave the chicken off next time since it didn't add anything to the dish. I thought it would likely be shredded chicken mixed in but instead was just a chicken breast on top, not bad but totally unnecessary for the dish. I really liked the vibe here and the food, the menu is huge so lots of options of delicious things to try. I will definitely come back next time I'm craving Mexican food!",

I have no flipping idea what it was, but it was amazing.   The tacos were so fresh and incredible! This is now my place whenever I'm visiting Vegas I will go here and make my friends come with me. The ambiance was wonderful, it was decorated in a very traditional eclectic Mexican way, had a really nice feel to it. In fact, when I was driving by I looked at this place and thought to myself \"I bet that place is really good.\" So I checked out reviews and the website later that evening and went the very next day. I was not disappointed at all.   Even the starter soup that came with my dish was so delicious! I didn't even know it came with a starter soup, so it was a really nice surprise!  The owner was there walking around being friendly to customers, it was really nice. Had a really positive feel to the entire restaurant that truly added something special to the experience.   I can't wait to go back.   M.M.",

And he did it with grace and humor :)   We got: The Cucumber Lime Margarita with Tajin rim, crisp and refreshing. Albongias soup, omg like someone's abuela is in back making those balls by hand. Platter with pork green chili and chili relleno, everything tender and flavorful. Plus a taco pescado a la carte. Mojarra Fritta, which Richard took care to ensure I knew what I was getting. A whole fried fish--bones, head and all. Didn't bother me! Insanely delicious, coated with dry spices and deep fried to perfection. Bones were easily dealt with, despite the low lighting.  And, since Richard learned it was our anniversary, he hooked us up with sombreros, tequila shots and churros with whipped cream, all while he and his coworkers serenaded us.  It was a perfect dinner and we will definitely return!",

We were seated near some guy on a stage who thought he could sing. He was so loud we couldn't hardly talk to each other.  The place was very noisy. The waiter was not very attentive.

The salsa and beans they start you off with are great. The guacamole is made table side and you choose what you want on it. Almost every plate comes with a hefty serving of guacamole as well. If you check in they give u a margarita. It's always packed hit the service is great. Your cup will never empty.. Even with the Aguas Frescas. Their food is authentic and a reasonable price compared to similar higher end Mexican restaurants in the LA area.",

    "text": "Okay HI! We tried a different place each night on this last little jaunt to Vegas and because I am so much of a Smartina Navratolova I wanted Mexican food and so I went to my Yelp app on my Smart phone and searched for a highly rated restaurant with reasonable prices and Bonito Michoacan came right up.  We were in the neighborhood (my brother in law is Chinese) so we hung a U and drove right into the parking lot (yeah buddy they even have parking fa YA)!   We went inside and the place is beautiful.  There is a beautiful woman who hand makes tortillas RIGHT there. I love that.   The bathrooms are beautifully decorated ...beautiful I LOVE the copper basins.  The whole place is colorful,extremely inviting and interesting.   So we walk inside from hot to cool.  We are greeted by a young woman with a beautiful smile and they have a table ready for us (party of 7).  They bring over these hot chips, with warm bean dip AND really delicious salsa.  (This is new, most places offer salsa and chips and that's it right?)   Then a very nice gentleman asks if we would like drinks YEAH! We order 3 top shelf frozen margaritas (two plain, one mango) and my Mother said it was the best margarita she's ever had...they came out quickly, very well blended and huge (meets all my criteria :-)    So far ...I AM IN HEAVEN I thought...but then we hear music and there is a male singer who sings a beautiful array of Spanish dinner songs and even one Bossa Nova (EYE EYE YEY) Now I am in heaven.  So we check the menu, very reasonable prices, I ordered the Steak Ranchero medium rare, my Mom ordered SHRIMP Ranchero and there were 5 other orders ...I was a little too busy with my margarita to tell you what they got but I can tell you they were all happy.  We did not have room for dessert this time but I am definitely going back next time I get to Vegas and I will update this report when I do okay?   The food was fresh, tasty, hot and it came out of the kitchen quickly.  I had to get a to go box and so did my mother.    They offer hot tortillas, with butter if you ask and the service was oN POINT. Friendly, polite, sweet and generous. My mother said she loved that place and believe me ...she is usually a ...well... a mother.   I have not felt as if I got MORE than my money's worth in quite a long time but (well technically since I didn't pay ...oh you get the picture)   Very very good find, thanks yelp, thanks everyone who rated this restaurant because you all helped make a great evening possible for my family.  My mother has been ill and we thought this trip would cheer her up and she loved this place so much, we all did.   Now you go and eat there and bring your family and friends ( I saw a wedding party y'all) and tell me how you liked it.  I know you are going to be so happy! Go now.",

I was told our event would be private and so was charged per person peope we didn't know were seated with us. But last but not least my wedding cake was delivered a day before but was never brought out. so my 50 person cake went to my hotel with me. All i got was a sorry.. But they were never to busy to take $1,200 from us!! I can tell you food is great but having an event here I would say no. I had another place in mind and should have stuck with it totally my fault.",

Be sure to check in on YELP for a free margarita, then vote for them through text and receive a SECOND free margarita!!! Can't beat that!!   I showed up with a friend who was having his birthday dinner there and our server \"Richard\" took great care of us. He was funny, entertaining, and attentive to our needs. He recommended the prime rib carne asada plate and it definitely did not disappoint! He kept the drinks coming and even showed us how to get the free margaritas on the house by voting on text and checking in through YELP.  He also recommended the sampler special and made us fresh guacamole and dip at the table side. Real funny guy also.  If you show up at dinner you also get treated to listen to their one man mariachi band on the keyboard doing his thing lol. 5 stars for EXCELLENT service. Will definitely be back if I'm craving for some Mexican food!",

If you don't mind that part and are just there for food and drinks I would def recommend if you're a person with no to tolerance for wait times search for your Mexican food fix elsewhere",

    "text": "We went on a Friday evening fairly early. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken right away. The food was great, and the portion sizes were perfect!  Now why the 3 Stars... There was a yelp offer for a free margarita, so I ordered that. The waiter was a young guy and he was nice enough and gave us great service at first. When I showed him the coupon for the margarita he said I got the small margarita and the coupon was for an even smaller one, but he could bring me the other size instead if I wanted.  That was nice, but seemed kind of dumb to waste one for a fresh one just for a silly coupon so I declined. We ordered our food and it came out quickly.  Then things turned, the section we had been seated in started filling up with large parties, three that I could see, two were large tables worth and one was a group of ladies that they seated right next to our booth. We could barely hear each other talk. Our waiter never came back to our table to check on us and when we were done we sat for about 30 minutes with an empty table waiting for our check.  Finally the young man that brought our chips and salsa came and checked on us and ended up bringing us our check. Our waiter was clearly busy with these large parties as he was slammed with back to back tables of people and we paid the price for it. As we were leaving the rest of the restaurant was quiet and almost had no one in it. I felt bad for our waiter and I was glad I did not \"punish\" him tip wise.   We will try this place again, maybe in the middle of the week next time. Maybe I'll even get to use a coupon if I have another one.",

They have a very extensive menu; be sure to check-in for your free margarita!  They serve one complimentary round of chips and salsa and beans. Refills are about $3.50. Staff were very friendly and responsive. Soft drinks were refilled quickly and proactively.   The chips and salsa were good. The chips were crunchy and not greasy while the salsa was fresh though not terribly spicy.   I tried the chicken \"Dr Francisco.\"  Grilled chicken breast with light olive oil seasoning and served with prunes. Quite a unique and tasty dish.  Tender chicken, and the prunes actually went well with it.   For dessert we had the fried ice cream flambe which means it was set on fire at the table and burned briefly. This was a bit of a miss. It tasted basically like a scoop of ice cream rolled in slightly burned cornflakes.    Overall this was a decent meal with quite good service. It wasn't extraordinary but also wasn't really too bad. I would be willing to try it again though it didn't quite live up to the rave reviews.",

So after the CES show, we made our way here.  For starters they gave us chips, bean dip, salsa and some tomato noodle soup for free! We ordered ceviche to share and for myself I got a whole fried fish tilapia with sauce on the side and a mangonada margarita. The sauce that was served with the fish was so fricking delicious! The magonada margarita was refreshing and reminded me of those lollipop mango candies I use to buy from the ice cream truck.  Service was exceptional, super friendly and attentive.

The kicker here is the manager Gerardo is a crook. He said i should have known that about prepaid gift cards! He never said sorry and i had to chase him the next day for my money since he double charged me. Go somewhere else like flaming Fajitas! Hell of lot better food and service.",

They have great lunch deals on weekdays. They serve your table free chips, spicy salsa, bean dip and tomato soup with noodles in it.  For a moment I thought I was in a Korean restaurant that gives you free Banchan  dishes. Good portions size. I and my companions will definitely return again! Friendly service. Free photo of your party as a keepsake which was an unexpected surprise which made the meal more memorable. So much food with the pork carnitas which is probably great for dinner, but not for lunch, unless you are starving. Ha! Ha! Ha!  The two chile rellenos were excellent and cheesy as I ordered the combo that came with beef taco, beans, rice and some salad.   Had to get doggie bag to go. Yummy.",

The meal started with complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip. The salsa was a little too spicy for me, but it had the right amount of spice and saltiness. The bean dip was very good; it was smooth and not overpowering, pairing well with the warm, fresh tortilla chips. The meal also came with a Fideo; it was hot and perfect for the cold night. The tomato flavor was amazing and the onion gave it a slight kick.   I had the Enchiladas Michoacanas with steak and it was amazing! The warm tortillas were filled with cotija cheese that crumbled delicately; it had a saltiness that paired well with the enchilada sauce. The steak was cooked to perfection as well. It was a medium rare with a hot pink center that was easy to cut through and delicious to eat. It was seasoned lightly, as the steak did not need any extra flavors to make it stand out. When paired with the enchilada - AMAZING! When put together, the flavors had a good harmony and the dish was absolutely enjoyable.",

Sombreros off to Richard (per the receipt)!  We were also seated right next to the singer/piano player and he was a regular Mexican Sinatra. He knew the right songs to play at the right time at the right decibel. A True sign of someone who knows how to read a dining room. If we didn't have to head back to LA that day, I think we all would have sat there for hours eating their fresh AF guacamole (honestly, why can't I make it like this at home when I have all the same ingredients?!?) with chips, throwing back their refreshing AF micheladas, and singing/dancing with the whole Bonito crew. Clearly, they know how to AF things.  The place was packed with huge groups of locals, so you know it's a legit, off-the-strip joint. There's bar seating if you're by yourself or with an amigo and a handful of booths, but clearly this place specializes in big parties of people.   The salsa was a little off for some of us (it left a weird aftertaste), but the guac and homemade chips more than made up for it.  Everyone seemed to really love their dishes, but I can only speak for the tortilla soup with handmade flour tortillas (I think most dishes come with the option of corn or flour tortillas - just get the flour; even Richard said so). The soup was plentiful, had just the perfect amount of grease coating the top, and the broth was super flavorful.  And again, the micheladas went down like water...if water was a michelada.  Would definitely make my way back the next time I'm in Vegas, and hopefully with more time on my hands.",

While their \"Queso Fundido\" is still one of the best in the American Southwest, don't expect the same level of quality from their sub-par Margarita.  Aside from being \"slurpee-esque,\" the price almost made me choke on the free chips (which are a major saving-grace). $12 for a SINGLE MARGARITA?!  The two I ordered drove the bill up by almost $25! For that price, I'll hire a LADY named Margarita to love me for the night (or hour).  Also, as big as the cheese skillets were, they brought a mere 3 tortillas for us ravenous patrons to savagely fight over. When we asked for more, we still had to wait another 10 minutes, all the while staring at the delicious but forbidden cheese sitting before us!  It's not like we could use our hands! Utensils are what seperate us from the animals!",

All the coworkers  gathered and sang two different birthdays.  The decor was very colorful and gave the Spanish vibe.  As I looked their menu I was getting pretty  full eating their complimentary snack- chip and dips.  They had bean, salsa and guacamole (this was extra $8)  :P  what was so awesome, was how they made the guacamole right in front of us!  Two whole avocados and get to tell them how spicy you like it.  Then they also give this comp soup cup - chicken/tomato I think ? It was pretty delicious.   Their cilantro steak ($16) was very tender - I ordered the steak medium rare.  They had  Green sauce with sauteed onions on top of the steak.  It came as a combo - with rice and beans.    I also tried their chile relleno burrito ($8.95).  I wasn't too impressed with it.  This is what I would order at any other Mexican fast food chains, but this restaurant made it like an enchilada style - with tomato salsa over it.   Maybe next time I'll tell them just like a regular burrito with beans and rice inside the burrito and no sauce on top :P",

The only reason why they're getting 4/5 is because we waited an incredibly long time to get our orders taken. They were busy, but not so extreme as to where we should've waited the time that we did, but you have the chips to keep you busy anyways! Regardless, the food was great and so is the atmosphere.",

Our server was very friendly and always checked up on us and right away we were served with chips, salsa, and beans. The salsa was okay I just wish it was more fresh than watery. I ordered the guacamole since everyone recommended it and it was delicious. You get to pick what you don't want in it because they make it in front of you. I went with the steak ranchero for dinner since I felt like some steak. I have to say it was made to my liking' not too salty and not too dry.   Can't wait to come back here and try another dish!",

As usual, I will split the review is three basic areas:  Facilities: Very clean and inviting, with an authentic flair. Sitting in this restaurant makes you forget you are in Vegas! Centrally located, its a great restaurant to visit if you are in the mood for some great food.  Service: There is an opportunity in this area. Although our drinks were always full and bussing was prompt, the staff could have been a bit friendlier. Do not expect smiles from your waiter.  Food: Probably some of the best Mexican food in Vegas. Any item on the menu is fresh and delicious! Do yourself a favor and try and try either the chicken or the steak with cognac sauce... it is out of this world!!!",

    "text": "I'm surprised by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place. I found the food to be very blah. Let me first say that the service was excellent. The servers were so friendly and checked on us often. If it weren't for them I would have given 2 stars.  The meal started off with chips, salsa and bean dip. The bean dip was ok but the beans really had no flavor and were very runny. The salsa was horrible.  It was also watery thin and had a weird flavor. After what I heard about this place I was excited to try the salsa but I prefer a chunky fresh salsa and this tastes like something from a can.  Then came a cup of Fideo Soup for us. This was tasty and it had a lot of noodle in it.   For my meal I had the #4 which consisted of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and a bean tostada with guacamole. Blah blah blah! The enchilada had barely any cheese in it and the sauce they put on top was as nasty and weird tasting as the salsa. The beef taco was cute and small but the beef had no flavor. My tostada had beans and tons of lettuce.. The small of guacamole I had was actually very tasty. I would never order this again I just didn't care for it and the taste. I could have done with out all the lettuce and had more of the other stuff on it.  My man had Fajitas and he said they weren't as good as Ricardo's or Cabo but he said they were decent. I tried a piece of his flour tortilla and I have to say I should have just ordered a stack of those and some guacamole because the tortillas were good. And the tortillas weren't small either they were a decent size.  The pic I took and posted on here looks way more appetizing then it really was. I tried to like it but I just honestly didn't :(  They had a man singing live music which was a nice touch. and happy hour specials  but during happy hour a margarita is still going to run you $4.50.  I don't see when we would be back here since there are other yummy Mexican places around town and especially with Ricardo's just down the street.",

This was a perfect way to start our meal,  while we were looking over the menu we were served chips, salsa and beans.   We were starving so that went pretty fast.   We then ordered our entrees,  I ordered the camerones al conac and he ordered camorones dionisio.  We were still hungry after the chips and salsa so we ordered chips and guacamole which they prepare tableside.   (You can definitely tell these servers do the tableside guacamole several times a day) it's nice that they ask if you want all the ingrediants and how spicy you would like your guac.  The guacamole was nice and refreshing with our margaritas.   Then our soup came.   The fideo soup was a small cup of tomatoey brothey noodle goodness,  I finished every last bite.  When our entrees came out, we both finished everything off our plates,  shrimp,  tortillas,  rice,  beans and a dallop of guacamole,  everything was good!   I enjoyed everything from the service to the margaritas to the appetizers to the entrees,  by this time we were pretty full so passed in the desserts,  I definitely recommend this place for the service,  atmosphere and food.",

I know they thought I was crazy leaving the strip, but I told them it was well worth the short trip! Two family members are Mexican and took a long time to study the menu. They are both from California and have never seen some of these entrees on a menu except in Mexico!  The complimentary bean dip is good and the tableside, fresh-made guacamole is the best! My niece does not usually eat guacamole and she loved it here! I've had some of the lengua dishes before and they are the best I've had! This trip I had the Biria de Chivo (a type of goat soup). I have not had goat since I was in Greece in the 90's and this was so tasty and tender with excellent spice. My only issue is that I did not have room for more! Oh, and let's not forget the margaritas! They actually make them with tequila...good and strong...wink, wink. Fantastico!  If you want to enjoy REAL Mexican food at a fraction of the price of restaurants on the strip, then this is the place! Great food, great service, great prices and more money for Blackjack!",

It is about a couple miles off of the strip, and is situated in the middle part of a suburban area.   As soon as we got there, it was evident that this was going to be a great restaurant judging by how packed it was. There were nothing but locals here, and the waiters/waitresses were great! They were really funny and accommodating. There was live music playing in the background and I think there must have been at least 4 birthday celebrations while we were there. They make a huge deal about birthdays and even bring out the tambourines.  The food was excellent (I highly recommend the Steak Al Cilantro), the service was great, and the atmosphere was fun.  The prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get. Oh yeah, did I mention they give you fresh made tortillas?   Try this place out for some great Mexican food! You will not be disappointed!",

After reviewing the many positive reviews on Yelp, we knew Bonita Michoacan was a 'must try' place. We were not disappointed. Oh, my, what awesome food and absolutely wonderful service.  We were initially provided with chips and their home made red salsa and also a bowl of refried bean dip. The salsa was well seasoned and the beans were addictive. We ordered a hotter salsa (because that's how we roll) and were brought a green salsa--whew! Fabulous and very hot.  We ordered the Mexican Pizza appetizer with a side of roasted jalapenos and grilled onions. Both were so delicious -- we highly recommend!  I had a combo platter with the pork verde and guacamole burrito -- fabulous. This truly is a must - try restaurant!",

Quick friendly seating, attentive waitstaff, and an eagerness to get everything right.  I once had a dish that wasn't as hot as I wanted and they fell over themselves to please me -- getting it exactly right the second time.  I don't eat onions.  No problema.  I want extra sauce, or sauce on the side, or extra jalapenos.  No problema.  My latest visit, with my good friend Andrei, was typical.  I had a monstrously large Caldo de Pollo (Chicken Soup) as a dinner.  Wonderfully ample white meat chicken -- at least a breast, maybe a breast and a half.  The cilantro was fresh.  The other spices delicious.  My friends garlic chicken was similarly spectacular -- even without the red peppers he's allergic to.  All the chips, salsa, and guac that you could want.  And a price that left money for our main purpose -- playing poker.  I love variety.  And Las Vegas probably has more Mexican restaurants than any city, including Mexico D.F..  Even so, a trip to this city always includes a trip to this restaurant -- so sure am I of getting a high quality, reasonably priced, delicious meal.",

    "text": "Came here tonight for a friends birthday. Being Mexican, I'm hesitant trying other Mexican food places, but I have it a chance for her sake. We were seated with the rest of our group immediately, which is nice. We promptly got cups of water, and once we ordered, we got little cups of fideo soup. It was good, nothing special, tasted straight out of the packets you buy at the store. After, we proceeded to wait about half an hour for our drinks and then about another hour or so for our food. The food wasn't authentic. I understand it was towards the end of the night when we went, but my rice shouldn't have been crunchy. Old rice, beans from a can, flavorless chicken fajitas with more vegetables than anything. I also had a beef tamale that tasted very basic, run of mill, nothing special type, you know? The strawberry margarita was the best thing I had all night. I paid about $30, without the gratuity that they tacked on. The atmosphere is pretty alright, but the food is crap and definitely nowhere near authentic. Go if you want, I won't be returning.",

I also really liked the complimentary chips, bean dip and salsa. I will totally be making a return.",

Had a regular and mango margarita. Margarita craving fixed.   Got the guac as an app. A must. They mash it up table side, so you pick the ingredients. No onions for me. I had the chicken taco, tosdada,and enchilada combo joint. Wow! My girl had the bean burrito and beef taco combo. Said she liked it (Was her pick to eat here since she said it was the best). Tons of stuff on the menu. All this for $55 and my girl had 2 margarita's too. Definitely good.    The only complaint is that the decor is a little old, but I like the mom and pop hole in the wall type places. I also ate wayyyy too much and it felt like a rock was in my stomach all night.",

A group of friends and I in our travels dropped in due to a free margarita promotion and the party started with our awesome waiter, Richard. Then I - a black guy - took on the Gringo challenge (not spoiling it, go and take it on yourself) and got another free drink! The food was top notch and pardon the misogyny but the ladies are gorgeous too, please respect them as they want to make sure your time there is optimal with pictures and drinks as well.

Other people at my table got their soup.  Second,, I didn't get flour tortillas that was supposed to come with my dinner.  I asked the waiter to bring me the tortillas that I was supposed to get and he still never brought them.  I ordered a lemonade with my meal which they brought but they refilled the glass with water.  I probably will try the place again but won't go out of my way to go there.",

Right away, you'll notice the salsa and bean dip are great. Next, you'll notice the appetizer soup is flavorful. Then, you will certainly enjoy your entree, almost all of which are memorable and tasty. What's more, if you get the tableside guacamole, you won't be disappointed.  As a vegan, I'll say you can't beat the veggie fajitas. Probably the best veggie fajitas I've ever had or heard of anywhere, which are an interesting and delicious assortment of vegetables, served up with homemade tortilas, flour or corn (you can't go wrong either way).  For out of towners, this place is located conveniently about 5-10 minutes west of the Strip and, seeing how it is miles ahead of any Mexican restaurant at any casino, it is worth the short trip.",

Place is very large and can seat a lot of people. There were some people having dinner here but it wasn't too crowded. The inside decor sort of reminded me of a red lobster lol. One thing that's cool about the decor is there are picture decorations on top of the tables and with matching chairs at each table. My server was \"Lorenzo\" I think. Service was very good and fast and the waiter were funny and entertaining. There was an old man providing live Latin music in both English and Spanish. While I normally don't like live music with my dinner, the artist was very good (he gets 5 stars). They give chips and salsa at the start. Their menu is very large and they have pictures for a lot of items which I assume are the more popular ones. I got the steak cilantro which came with rice, beans, salad, and guacamole, and tortillas. The plate was huge probably should be shared by 2 people. Definitely a must try at this restaurant. I got a fried ice cream for dessert but I don't think the ice cream is actually fried. It tasted like vanilla ice cream with a corn flake cereal coating. The vanilla ice cream was delicious but I wanted more of a crispy shell. Overall, I was very happy I decided to try this place out. Definitely come here if you're craving Mexican food. The portions are generous, the food is delicious, and at a decent price.",

We've had a huge array of their food. We love the carnitas. Everything from seafood to chicken to steak is yum yum. Pricing: Totally reasonable! Whether it's a date night, celebration, or just dinner with friends, it's totally affordable.",

Which was delicious by the way. We started with appetizers. Sopitos.... chicken on top of gorditas with cheese, sour cream and guacamole. Then they served us with a small cup of soup before our main entree, which we were not expecting. Then onto our entree... chicken mole poblano for me.....DELICIOUS! Made the old traditional way. My hubby had the beef chimichanga which was deep fried and topped with sour cream. Both plates were so tasty and of course huge portions. Needless to say we will be back!",

The service was ok our waiter was kinda slow. I will say it was busy and a Saturday so that may have play in that but their was this other guy who was a delight as he was fast and would check on all the tables I can honestly say he might have been the one that saved the experience with the service because we hardly saw our waiter. I do recommend this place must go I say. I'm Mexican and can I just say how hard it is to find a decent Mexican restaurant and this was more that exceeded our expectations. Wish I had a picture of our food. We got the Parrillada it can with jumbo shrimp, carne asada (not the best), chicken (chicken is not always the best but may I say this chicken was amazing), chorizo, and on the side tortillas, guacamole, cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, also they bring another hot dish but with melted cheese!!! SO so good!",

I ordered a tilapia dish to do something different from the usual burrito or combo plate, and was very impressed. Whole fish, flaky moist meat, crispy skin and a flavorful sauce. It didn't feel at all heavy for a fried item. Came with a healthy portion of rice and beans, as well as french fries? Don't understand that part but even the fries were delicious. Very reasonable price ($13) for seafood and the portion size. Everyone else at the table seemed to thoroughly enjoy their selections as well.  I would definitely go back, even without a groupon.",

Others in my party had the chicken burrito and the chicken sopas -- both of which were reportedly great!   Service is super speedy -- they are quick and that includes taking your plate as you shove the last bite in your mouth and bringing you the check while people in your party are still finishing up too!  That's better than waiting for the check in my opinion though!",

Festive colors adorn the outside of the building, and inside there were a lot of Mexican decorations and murals. Very loud and very crowded with lots of Spanish speaking folks, so I was hoping that meant the food is good--and si, it was! Traditional Mexican dishes and drinks abound, and our server Jonathan was most friendly and patient with our numerous questions about the definition of some words on the menu and the food. I decided on the Carnitas Michoacan, which is pork marinated in oranges and spices and listed as \"the best carnitas in all of Mexico\", and I gotta agree! I really enjoyed the flavor and tenderness of the meat and all of the accompaniments--awesome! The portions were quite large, so most of our party did not finish their meals, but I totally wolfed mine down--lol! I also had a jalapeno cilantro margarita to go with my meal--woohoo, spicy and refreshing! We will be sure to visit again when we're in Vegas!",

First thing is first, the building is not the prettiest of places but i guess it fits the overall feel of the place, you walk in and 2 young ladies dressed in old Mexican dress great you and get you seated, the waiter then came by to see us and offer us drinks.. Let me stop and say that the waiter was extremely friendly and on top of every aspect of our meal. We ordered a Margarita and waters with the Table side Guacamole for an appetizer. this was probably the best guacamole i gave ever had. The meal also comes with not only your entree but you get sopa de fideo with every combo plus beans and rice, My grandma used to make sopa de fideo before she passed and it tasted just like her.  memories!!!    Okay so now that my review has turned into one long run on sentence I will just finish by saying the meals are huge, tasty and fairly priced, I definitely recommend this place if you like Mexican food and great service.",

    "text": "It was between here and Amigos Tacos, I decided to try this place because the reviews were pretty good. The parking was wide open, we were seated immediately and as I was excitedly anticipating, we got our chips - salsa - and beans. The chips were good, fresh. The salsa was very good for me but my BF prefers salsa with a little kick. The beans... well... they were OK, a little salty, but add salsa to the beans and a wonderful treat.   The menu is HUGE! It took me a while to go through everything and make a decision, I finally decided on the 2 taco combo (beef tacos) and he got the beef enchilada with green sauce combo. While snacking on the chips they brought out a soup.. I wasn't expecting soup, I still don't know what kind of soup it was but it was OK. About 2 minutes after the soup came, our meal came... The food looked good, plates were hot, that's always a good sign.   Now the meal... I took a bite of my taco and it was... a taco. The beef was lacking flavor, it was almost like they didn't season it while cooking, every Mexican restaurant I have been to has always used a combo of onions and other veggies/herbs to season their meat.. it just seemed.. blah. The rice was good, a little on the salty side as well and I usually put salt on everything, I like salt, but it was too salty for even me. my BF and I swapped plates to try each others dishes and his was very good. His beef was good, and it was the same type but since his food was covered lightly with enchilada sauce... i think it helped it out. I used some of his sour cream and the salsa and fixed up my taco.. not amazing but it was good.   All in all, I am happy we got to try it and I would come here again but I would definitely order something different. I will give Amigos Tacos a try next time and hope that their menu isn't as costly as it was here... over 5$ for guacamole..? Not worth it. But the main reason I will come back was the service, everyone was very friendly, our server paid attention to our table and once our drinks were half empty they had fresh ones on the table...",

The drinks were really good.  The reason I gave a 2 star is due to the service. We went on a rainy day, no wait at all. Our waitress VIOLET/VIOLETA pissed me off. She kept forgetting stuff and was overly cocky when she was providing shitty service. It started to leak on our table and ON US! She grabbed a pitcher and put it on the table to catch the leak, THATS FUCKING GROSS! We pointed out the leaks and she ducked out of the way worried about her helmet hair. Offer to move your guest! But no.. she kinda just forgot about us. I was with a large party celebrating a birthday so I didn't want to put her on the spot, although there was plenty of open tables and pretty slow she still managed to give us crappy service. One of our guests asked her if she was going to discount or comp anything since she had us sit under a leak she said, \"oh yeah sure, I gave you guys double discount\" (sarcastically) and walked away. No discount, no comp $2 soda, NOTHING!  I wasn't going to review this place but the service she gave really nice customers was messed up.",

Not friendly, no eye contact, they don't smile and seemed annoyed being asked for normal requests. We politely asked for more chips and for our drinks to be filled. They brought more chips but didn't bring more salsa or beans for the chips?    They forgot about our fideo soup and asked us if we ever got it and we told them we never did. They ended up bringing the fideo soup out with our meal.  It became uncomfortable asking for service from waiters or waitresses that simply don't want to be there or help you.

Anyways we order chilaquiles, one with red sauce and the other with green sauce with eggs.   It was okay.  Two kids plate,  one had a long hair in the rice. Yuk as my daughter commented.  They comp one of the kids meal and gave her a plate of new rice.  Julio did an excellent job, but the women Griselda (i think that is how you spell her name) was rude. She didn't acknowledge when we ask for things and her body language came across very negative.  What a disappointment since it was our first and probably will be our last time here.   Thanks for an unforgettable start to mother's day.  Glad we still have the entire day to make more memories.",

The food was nothing spectacular. Tasted like pretty much every other Mexican restaurant I've been to.  We ordered fried ice cream and bananas for dessert and to light them on fire they poured a full shot of tequila over it. All we could taste was tequila it made it pretty much inedible.   Decent food but nothing I would recommend.",

Then this is THE place for you, even if you can't pronounce the restaurant's name!  The menu includes all the dishes you'd expect at an American restaurant: burritos, tacos, fajitas et cetera et cetera, blah blah blah. But the enormous menu, literally pages long, includes many dishes you've probably never heard of, unless you happen to have spent a lot of time in Mexico.  Your meal starts out with complimentary chips, refried beans and very VERY spicy salsa. It was a bit much, even for me, but our server very happily and quickly replaced it with a slightly tamer version. The chips are made in-house, as are the tortillas, a nice touch that makes a big difference.  We ordered from the lunch menu, which is available from 11:00 to 3:00. It contains a plethora of items from the dinner menu at different price ranges, and doesn't include some of the extras that the dinner menu provides, like the bowl of chicken noodle soup that comes with the pricier dinner menu items.  If there's shrimp on the menu, you KNOW that's what I'll have. I've had the Camarones Borrachos (drunken shrimp), made with tequila and simply delicious, but not available on the lunch menu (I could have ordered from the dinner menu, but couldn't justify that much $$ for lunch), so I ordered the Camarones Saradeados, large shrimp cooked perfectly in a sauce that I'd never heard of. It's made from roasted peppers, undisclosed spices and a touch of mayonnaise, and they could bottle this stuff and make a fortune selling it! It was in the pricier category, but worth every peso and then some! My husband, whose palate is more conventional, ordered chicken fajitas, which came to table beautifully charred and sizzling. Both orders included beans, rice and house-made guacamole, the fajitas came with those yummy house-made tortillas. We had margaritas with lunch, labeled small but actually ample.  The restaurant itself is clean, well located, and with ample parking. The service is friendly and prompt, and the prices are reasonable. The voluminous menu includes Mexican delicacies like beef tongue, and they offer menudo on the weekends for those of you who may have partied a leeeeeetle too hard on the Strip the night before. It's a local place that, unfortunately for them, is unknown to tourists. If you're here from out of town misbehaving though, this is one off-Strip place that's definitely worth the short taxi ride - it's just minutes from the Strip. Do NOT miss this jewel!",

    "text": "A hidden gem in Las Vegas.  Service excellent.  Food excellent.  Prices very good.  We were served (gratis) chips and salsa AND refried beans.  I can't remember the last time refried bean were given as a free dish.  AND IT WAS SOME OF THE BEST REFRIED BEANS I EVER HAD.  The salsa was good, but I would have preferred it hotter.  We were hungry from a day hiking so we also ordered a guacamole  appetizer.  The guac was prepared table side to our taste, also excellent.  I ordered a coca-cola steak ala Mama Cielo, surprisingly it wasn't sweet at all just incredible juicy.  My adventurous choice paid off.  The service was exceptional.  The server came by, without asking and refilled my drink whenever it was empty (which was often - did I mention 100 degree weather in Las Vegas and hiking).  They also had a musician singing and playing Mexican love songs, surprisingly at the correct volume.  If I lived in Las Vegas, this would be my number 1 Mexican restaurant.",

Food took a while but worth the wait. During dinner 4 or 5 tables were celebrating birthdays sombreros singing ,when we were given the check there was no problem getting the attention of the server. No happy birthday wishes at our table! We always tip well maybe they thought the attention wasn't warranted. Very disappointed in the service. Yes I tipped the bus person.",

    "text": "Truly awful.  If I had not eaten here, I would not have believed it was possible to mess up Mexican food this badly.  By comparison, Taco Bell gets at least two Michelin stars.  Ambiance - A cut or two below Denny's, with Mexican colors.  The best I can say is that I didn't actually see any cockroaches.  There was some noise, which I assume was intended as music, but which sounded more like drunk UNLV students celebrating a basketball victory.  Service - Quick and disinterested.  In fact, quick is an understatement.  The food appeared within less than a minute, and was obviously pre-cooked and sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen.  Food - Awful, awful, and more awful.  The tortilla chips were not fresh.  The guacamole had so much lime juice that it was nearly inedible (and I LOVE guacamole).  The soup tasted like equal parts dishwater and vinegar, with a thimbleful of ramen noodles thrown in.  My beef burrito had chunks of beef (God, I HOPE it was beef) that appeared to be boiled soup meat, although the tortilla was fresh.  Even the rice and beans tasted acidic.  The portions were small (no Woody Allen jokes here, please), and the prices (by Mexican restaurant standards) were no bargain.  Don't get me wrong - $8 for the guacamole and $10.50 for each Margarita is not ridiculous in and of itself, but by the time the check came I was thinking they should have paid me to eat here.",

The mole poblano got good reviews at the table and some shrimp and cheese dish was big stars. The salsa had a nice kick.  The waiters were great.. Very attentive, and we were celebrating so they came and sang happy birthday (comic relief as maybe they sing that no matter the occasion as wasn't a birthday and they knew that lol) they put candles in the cupcakes they let us bring in and they offered to dance with the kids to the live music.  They let you watch the tortillas being made and overall a positive fun experience....other places I would go depending on what wanted but if the group wanted to go there I wouldn't protest",

We were greeted as soon as we walked in and seated right away. Our server came right out with chips salsa and beans to dip. After looking at the menu for a few minutes our server took our order and the food came right out. Everything everyone ordered looked and tasted great! We told our server it was one of our friends BDay and the whole restaurant came out and sang 2 songs to her! One in English and one in Spanish lol its was soo cool! They even gave her chooros topped with whipped cream lol we had a great time here and id recommend everyone who is looking for good food and great service to come here. You wont regret it!",

    "text": "Well....out of all the Michoacan family of restaurants, I would rank this my #3 choice, with Viva being #1 and Lindo being #2.  There's a couple of reasons for this -  1.) Viva gives you complimentary fideo soup when requested. If it doesn't come with an entree, Bonito charges you $2.50 for it. It's good soup but not worth paying $2.50 when it costs probably $.25/cup to make.  2.) The customer service is off par from the rest. I experienced a rude, short tempered server today at lunch. When I advised my meal came out wrong, he refuted \"well this is the way you told me you wanted it!\". Well, actually that's not the way I told you and I wouldn't be telling you it was wrong if you just listened the first time. My last visit, when I asked the question \"what is fundido dip?\" I was treated like I was stupid for not knowing. It was off putting. 3.) The busser was kind but she was bad at refilling drinks. My one pet peeve is drink refills. Don't keep me hanging.... 4.) The chips and bean dip that come out are bland. Do they use different chips & dip than the other Michoacan resturants? I'm not certain but they don't taste as good here.   There are good things about the resturant as well -   1.) They have an extensive Mexican themed menu with many options for even the pickest of eaters. My favorites are the beef chimichangas and the beef flour flautas. Their spanish rice is decent and their refried beans are good & consistent. I tried my friends carne asada steak today and it was juicy and yummy. Their homemade flour tortillas are delish! 2.) They run resonably priced lunch specials. For two of us, we escaped at around $20.00...not bad for a sit down lunch.  3.) It seemed as though before our tushs hit the seats that there were chips and dip on the table. We were immediately asked what we would like to drink. Very speedy in this regard. 4.) Pleasant hostess staff, large restaurant seating areas and a full service bar.",

    "text": "Have driven past this place for years and finally decided to give it a try. They are advertised as being \"authentic\" mexican food - so when I asked if they had Horchata they said yes, and when I asked if it was homemade they said NO. So much for being authentic. Their salsa has a weird taste to it, and is the worst salsa I've ever had. The chips we received were broken into tiny pieces (as if we had the bottom of the barrel). We saw other tables get their chips piled high and in large pieces. The waiter, Saul, seemed nice at first but I then realized he gave ALL his attention to the hispanic diners, we are white. I felt discriminated against. I ordered the Sopes and they were flavorless. Saul NEVER came to the table to ask how everything was - isn't this one of the main responsibilities of a server? I saw some older mexican woman walking around with a scowl on her face (probably somebody's illegal mother) and I politely asked her if we can have more chips and bean dip....she stared at me for a minute without saying a word. I repeated my request and in very broken English she says \"more??\", as if that was unheard of. Chips are always complimentary and refills are always given. When we left I had to ask for a to go box. Saw the mean old lady again since Saul didn't care to check on us and I had to talk with my hand showing this woman the size of a box I needed. this place needs to give ALL their customers the same respect and attention, no matter what race the people are. Train your workers to speak English since you are in America!! Never going back. Horrible experience from start to finish! Roberto's Taco Shop is more authentic than this place!",

Viva Michoacan and Lindo Michoacan  have such better food an atmosphere, I've learned my lesson to take the extra time and gas and get some good food.  Our waiter was friendly, and full of energy, he made the experience better.  The free tortilla chips were dark and over fried, also tasteless. The bean dip and salsa were okay, just seemed not as hot (spicy). The fideo soup was watery with about 20 noodles in it, I mean, it is so cheap to make fideo and this is what I get? I got a Soft Beef Taco and a Crunchy Chicken Taco, there was so much lettuce and shreded cheddar cheese on top I had to dig my way to my tacos. Both were edible and had a good amount of meat but didn't have much taste even after I drenched them in salsa. The crunchy taco was a little greasy. I actually thought they'd be more like street tacos since that's what I'm served at the sister restaurants. My husband got the Carne Asada Burrito, but he had them add cheese and mole sauce which they gladly did, it was okay, but was still missing something...especially some heat (spice).  I won't be going back, especially since there are so many better mexican restaurants.",

They bring you a fresh fideo soup for the whole table and it is warm and delicious. The Micheladas are so good and big! They have all these different types of drinks with fun names! The food is very delicious and flavorful, I ordered the carne asada, so juicy and full of flavor. I asked for the Carne Asada medium done and it was exactly how I wanted it. Everyone at the table was very satisfied and happy we came across this restaurant the service was great, food was definitely authentic, I will be coming back whenever I'm in town.   Also they take these cute pictures of your whole table that you can purchase afterwards!",

Paid about $13-$15 for a plate of 2 chicken enchiladas and rice. Others in my group hated what they ordered as well, my cousin ordered the enchiladas Michoacan and he said the steak meat inside tasted like rubber... all of our meat was tough, the enchilada sauce was more like a dried on paste, yuck. And again, I keep reiterating it because for some reason everything was just so dry! The Fideo soup was very good. I will give them credit where it's due, and the soup was truly good. In all honesty, You know it's bad when the chips and salsa were your favorite part of the meal. Will never return here :-(",

It really wouldnt have been that big of a deal had the food at least been good but everything was terrible and lukewarm. We go out to eat all the time and my gf used to own a burrito shop in cali and we both left saying how we havent had food that bad in a longggg time. Go to Robertos or Don tortaco or really anywhere else if you're looking for at least decent (not even great) mexican food lol.",

We only discovered it because we went to the bar for drinks and there was a small sticker that mentioned it. The points/punches are done via an app so even proving our previous visits, they can't add any. I have the app now and I will return but I think they should tell people about the loyalty program.",

You get bean dip and fideo soup with your meal it was very good! The service was great also. I'd also highly recommend the shrimp ceviche! So fresh and flavorful! I had the Camarones Dionisia..... basically Shrimp in a Chile Verde sauce with cheese melted in the oven with Rice and beans. Also really good!

I guess he was trying to tell me it was time to leave so because of that I have to give them a bad review on their service and feeling rushed I didn't get my dessert or another beer. I only left a 10% tip which I am usually a 25% or better tipper. He LOST OUT! I guess I should've known when I wanted to sit at the bar and was told to sit somewhere else that was my first clue that today was not going to be there day and they would not be on point on anything. Just wanted a quiet place to eat a meal and have a beer and enjoy it and relax on a Friday afternoon before it got too late. Not like I was sitting there or not ordering anything or spending any money but they just did not want anymore $$ I guess. Then while I had to go check myself out the girls in the front around the register gossiping about someone else that works there and that you can't tell them anything as they blow everything out of proportion don't want to hear the drama of a restaurant that I go to again just looking for a nice place to eat a nice dinner early and have a few beers and relax on a Friday afternoon now I know this is not the place to go.",

It seemed most of the entrees came with the delicious tomato fideo soup, beans, rice, and tortillas. They even have a glass booth where you can see the cute guy making the tortillas.   The margaritas were the best I've ever had. I had the cucumber one, my friend had the jalepeno one. They both came with a chili lime salt rim which was soo good. I'd be happy with just the comp chips which also come with salsa and refried beans.  I can't remember the name but I had the pork dish that's marinated over night in orange juice. It was pretty good. My friend had the Carne asada and the steak was so tender. My other friend had the deep fried snapper which was ok but nothing special.",

All of my experiences here have been during lunch time so I really can't tell you much about dinner. I'm sure it's the same, busier, and minus their lunch specials.  You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  My favorites include their carne asada plate and steak fajitas.  Their plates are huge and they hook up more than just the rice & beans.  Sometimes I'll dine here in the middle of dieting and have always found something \"clean\" enough to eat.  They'll even substitute some of the rice & beans for more steak.  Besides Vegetarians and Vegans, who doesn't want more steak?  It's not surprising that a lot of Yelpers rave about the service here.  The hostess and servers are all over customer service.  They treat you good here and most importantly, they'll keep your bowl of chips full.",

Ive been working in the restaurant business since 2016, and I know this is probably going to be stupid to some of you but when someone orders a beverage either you bring the straw to the table so they can put it in themselves or if the waiter/waitress wants to put the straw in for the customer then leave half the paper on... I don't know if you touched my straw with your dirty hands so that already grossed me out.   I'm not personally a big fan of Mexican food but I had family that wanted to go there so I love the Carne Asada Enchiladas anywhere I go and I thought I would try it here. It was gross... the carne asada had a weird taste to it, there red sauce tastes like generic spaghetti sauce, it looked burnt, there's usually a lot of cheese! My Aunt got the cheese enchilada and there was NO cheese at all inside the tortilla it was just all tortilla she always got the red sauce. When we told our waiter \"Isreal\" he kept nagging and nagging for us to get something else so I finally agreed and got the taquitos.   They're always so busy here and I don't get how... I've had a lot better Mexican food than this.",

The paintings on the wall are astounding and even the tables and chairs go with the overall theme of the restaurant.   I've ordered to go from here several times, I always end up getting Timo's Grandeto Burrito on the A La Carte menu (11.99) and it's HUGE! It could feed me for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!  On top of that, their green habenero sauce is amazing. I did stop in once to dine in on a Sunday night, they had live music (which was wonderful, might I add) and the server was amazing! When we first walked in however, the hostess did not even acknowledge us but she was with another customer so I let that slide and hope that next time that doesn't happen.   Overall, this place is amazing. If you're craving some great Mexican food with a beautiful atmosphere this is the place!!",

We asked politely if they could change the tv channel. And that didn't even happen. They don't accommodate the guest/customers. And the waiter was pretty rude, as we told him that we just wanted to get the check and leave. Pay for our drinks , as we know everything cost money lol.",

The food is pretty good or i wouldn't go back. The 3 star deduction is because of the service. Javier was our waiter, but he started taking the appetizers off the table before we were done. I told him we were not done with it and he put the plates back on the table like he was annoyed. I dropped $79.00 on lunch today and he never even said thank you or nothing. I get it, they're busy. But if you're busting your ass for tips, you should make your guests feel welcomed and not like they're inconveniencing you. I will probably go back, but i will not be sitting in Javier's section.",

I know this is a very popular spot in town. For this reason we have tried to make reservations before going to the restaurant. Several times we have been told that they do not take reservations when calling ahead just to find out that they did take reservation and by the time we get there, there is a huge waiting list ( over an hour wait time).  When asking the staff how come they didn't took my reservation when calling earlier all they had to say was that at the time they were already full on reservations. Being  booked up is very different from not taking reservations at all.   Even when waiting (yes the food is worth the wait) the staff does not communicate at all how close you are to be seated, they never seem to know what's going on and give you attitude if you hold them accountable for their previous statements.   Like mentioned before the food is great but the staff could use some major improvement.",

There are several Lindo Michoacan Resturant and I believe this one is the original location...but I can be wrong. Located on Decatur in between Twain and Flamingo in a big corner lot by itself. Cool out door patio and cozy interior with low ceilings and different aesthetically compared to it's other big location in Summerlin and Henderson but the food definitely makes up for it in big ways.  I came with a party literally of 14 for a late company Christmas dinner in January and Violeta handle us with complete ease. She was not only helpful but she was so pleasant, swift and personably. I really enjoyed her, her smile and friendly service made it for a great experience. She went around the table with individual attention with and balance us and getting her job done Kirk a pro. The whole staff was amazing especially when we had the entire crew singing happy birthday to one of our guys. It was so fun complete with a mariachi band, a ginormous sombrero and a tequila shot poured into your mouth and your head shaken by the person who does so. It takes me back to my trip to Cancun; so much fun.   We had happy hour bucket of Coronas (they were baby ones) and some of us ordered margaritas which there was some very interesting flavors that I really wanted to try but I stuck to my tequila on the rocks and again Violeta did not disappoint when asked for her recommendation. I'm not sure how everyone's food was but the whole table had nothing but good things to say about what they got to eat. I got to try my neighbors carnitas and it was BOMB. So tender and full of flavor and not dried and tough like pork at other places can be. I gave him a taste of my Cilantro steak which I ordered Moo mooing as Violeta would say and he liked it a lot as well. The steak was rare and the green cilantro sauce on top was really good. The guacamole table side was so good but I missed the show because I showed up late.   All in all a wonderful experience and when the food is good out of the ball park is what they hit!",

Managed to get there for Happy Hour and my girlfriend had the large Cadillac Margarita, and even I liked it, and did not take much to get my girl friend drunk. Also had the  Steak al Cognac (New York steak cooked to taste, sauteed in cognac, mixed with mushrooms, onions, secret spices, a little sour cream and a touch of cognac) 19.99. It was a really great deal, and the sauce was superb. Would definitely recommend this place for their steaks. Forget the steak houses which will charge you a lot more for a steak which is not as good. If you have kids they should love the ambience, and great for adults also. The Sopaipillas were only $3.49 and the Churros were only $3.24 and they were both great.",

The complementary chips, salsa and bean dip are excellent, we always end up getting more because of how quickly they disappear. Rarely do we have to ask for more chips, salsa or anything for that matter since service is always very attentive...   I tend to stick to 'standard' dishes when I eat here... they have great tacos, excellent fideo soup, wonderful enchiladas and the strawberry margaritas are made with real fruit, yum! They make their guacamole table-side here, you can request it as mild or as spicy as you prefer.  Prices are reasonable for the large portions you get...   This isn't your on the strip, \"fine dining\", spending $50 a plate, fancy dancy type restaurant but it's still well worth a stop even for a special occasion like a birthday... The employees come out singing, with musical instruments and a big sombrero for the special person to wear. I think you get a complimentary dessert as well... It's embarrassing if it's your birthday, hilarious if you are with the birthday boy/girl and entertaining if you just happen to be there when it happens.",

The sopa de fideo wasn't bad either but I love my mom's better :) the service was awesome. Our waiter was super courteous and came frequently to refill our drinks. The place is very nicely decorated with authentic Mexican decor and the Spanish music (Vicente Fernandez) playing in the background just added more charm and authenticity to this good Mexican restaurant.

They make the to taste right at the table.  Drinks are also good. As an added attraction there is a lady making tortillas right in the front. Not the easiest place to find but worth the search.",

Our server, Richard, was totally awesome and boosted this from a 4 star to a 5 star review. He was super friendly, helpful, attentive and made some bad-ass guacamole! The food was delicious and very authentic according to my latin boyfriend. The homemade tortillas were sooo good, the steak & chicken fajitas very tasty also. We had a great time and will definitely be back for more.",

The soup!!!! Great Drinks! Amazing food Best seafood dishes (as my partner claims, I hate seafood) Home made tortillas Chips and Salsa!!!!!  At least 50% of the customers are Mexican and come in groups. They do it right here.....It's worth getting off the strip for if your visiting, and the money you save eating away from the strip pays for your cab ride.  What are you waiting for?",

Carnitas are stiff and smell like old feet, bland chicken tacos, bland enchiladas. Only positives were the shrimp which were decent at best and the homemade tortillas but what good is a tortilla if there's nothing tasty to put in it.   If you're from la or sf skip and save your Mexican for cali. If you're from Vegas go anywhere else. There's no way it can be worse than this.",

She passed the empty sweetener bag test with flying colors!  First. my dinner came with fideo soup.  It was very good with less of a tomato taste than I'm used to getting.  There was more of a chicken stock flavor.  For the main course, I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo, two cheese enchiladas heated in a red mole sauce with a chicken breast, refried beans, rice, and some lettuce shreds and a dollop of sour cream.  The mole tasted a bit sweet at first but then I got the undertones of the other spices and the richness of the mole came out.  The chicken breast was good.  It was seasoned in any manner so I gave it a good shower of Tapatio.  For dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  I guess fried ice cream is just something that comes out of the freezer.  I don't think anyone \"breads\" and fries the ice cream in real time anymore.  I was very pleased with my visit.  I was of two minds about where I was seated.  Two men were having a loud discussion (argument?) about politics in Spanish and the one had enough tecate to not know how loudly he was talking.  However, I could have been sitting in another part of the restaurant where there was a crying baby.  I think it was better where I was.    This was an enjoyable dinner!",

The staff are friendly. The place is clean. The location, super easy to find. Good parking spots.   Firstly, the chips & salsa they serve when you first sit down are delicious. They also serve BEAN DIP! We always get the guacamole as well & it is made table side! Be careful not to eat too much & stuff yourself before you even order, like I always do.   The menu is so big, it always takes me a while to decide. They have a combination menu for people like me who can't decide on what to get. Last time I got the beef taco & cheese enchilada combination, which is served with rice and beans.   They also have a great desert menu! I forgot what the name was, but we ordered the Fried ice cream with bananas around it. It was delicious! Also, their margaritas are exceptionally good.   Definitely going here any time I want good Mexican food in Las Vegas.",

I could actually make a meal out of these alone, but I paced myself.  Unlike my last review I was able to get my favorite Raspberry Iced Tea, and it was delicious.  Mom had a Chicken Chimichanga, our daughter had a Steak Burrito, and I ordered a Chopped Beef Burrito.  All of them came with the usual rice and beans.  We ordered a side of Guacamole and to our surprise, our server Lorenzo brought out all of the ingredients including the fresh avocados and began to prepare it right there at our table.  He seasoned it just to our liking and wow, delicious.  Mom and I spooned the fresh guacamole on our burritos, mmm, a nice added spice to an already delicious burrito.  Lorenzo was a great server, very attentive to our needs, and of course, our drinks never went dry.  Overall, Bonito Michoacan is an excellent restaurant and we will certainly be back.",

We were seated right next to the music so I couldn't even hear the person next to me. The flavor of the food was was off, chicken was chewy, orders were wrong, and the kids meal was not eatable. The only plus to my dinner was the margarita I ordered. Maybe the restaurant was having an off day... but it made me not want to go back ever.",

Their fideo soup is amazing and great for hangovers. Their lunch specials is a great portion with reasonable prices.  The shrimp cocktail had no flavor what so ever and I also ordered the bacon wrap shrimp plate here and was disappointed because the shrimp was under cooked with no seasoning. Everything else is great",

Their guacamole is delicious, the beans were so good, tacos were fried perfectly and not greasy. My husband had the chile rellenos and enchilada and loved them. My son had the fideo and quesadillas, he said his dinner was \"the best\" :D Our favorite was the sopa de fideo. This is the first restaurant I have been to that offered it in their menu and it tasted totally homemade and was incredibly delicious!! Also the service was awesome, probably the best we've had in a long time. Waiters were friendly, our drinks and chips/dip were never empty, and they made sure to check in with us pretty often. Highly recommend this place! Will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas!!!",
