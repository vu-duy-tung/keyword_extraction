Like the Tucson restaurant I enjoyed the open kitchen concept but if you're looking for a place to have a quiet conversation this is not it. That being said the food is excellent We started off with the grilled artichoke Which was smothered in parmesan and served with an aioli. Was disappointed in our muscles they were overcooked and dry. Moving on to the mains the bolognese is outstanding And would highly recommend it. The chicken strozzapreth Was creamy and the chicken tender and moist I ordered the squid ink Mafaldin and would certainly order it again. The wait staff was knowledgeable and had a good understanding of the menu and helped our over all experience be positive. Will definitely return.",

We were impressed with how similar everything was to the food we once ate in Italy. Highly recommend Chelsea as a waiter, she was attentive and kept our drinks full (which is always a struggle for us) all the while she was fun to interact with. If you're in the area and love Italian food, this place is a MUST Try the chef's board and the bolognese.(:",

We started with the daily pizza and cheese board which included a special $20 deal for bottle of wine and cheese board. Waiter informed us that the happy hour Rose was not available but they had red or white. We stated we preferred Rose. He explained they have one that's not the happy hour, but he'd ask a manager if he could give us $10 off or a discount since they couldn't accommodate us with their happy hour offer. He came back and said they might have one more bottle of the happy hour. But then returned with the other Rose stating they were out of their happy hour Rose. I figured we were getting the discount he mentioned. When the bill came he said his shift was over and introduced us to a new waiter.  When I reviewed the bill and noticed full price wine, I was a little surprised. I didn't want to ask and delay his shift ending and my husband gets embarrassed when I ask about prices. Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about this place. We really enjoy it. However, I'm just really surprised that a fine establishment wouldn't offer a discount or accommodate the guests a bit if they are out of the wine on the happy hour. That's all. Thanks for the good service.",

This used to be our birthday celebration spot, but no more. We had a reservation and still had to wait a long time for our table. I never got my Minestrone soup that I asked for. My chicken parm was cold, and 15 minutes after I ask for a to go container, she sets it down and immediately ignores me to talk to the old couple next to us. The manager talked to them too. Must be big shots. Asking for anything brought nothing, but attitude. We still tipped her well, but it will be the last dollar this place sees from any of us. They are too big for their britches. It's a big deal to ask for water. No thanks. No more.",

The pizza & spaghetti & meatballs were ordered and both were over salted. Unfortunately it was a packed house and our server seemed to have too many tables so we couldn't get her attention in time.  My food however was very good. Short rib pasta. Rich tasting beef, as if it was braised for days. The date burrata was good, oddly the burrata lacked flavor, almost bland. But the dates made up for it.  Would try going back again. A franchise, so check out the other cities as well.",

We were seated outside but with the heaters the temperature was terrific. The atmosphere of this place is great. You could come here for a casual dinner, an after work drink, or on a date.   But. We waited an extraordinary amount of time for a pretty basic meal on a night that wasn't exceptionally busy. The manager was very polite, came over and apologized and offered us another appetizer. We were enjoying ourselves and declined as the food was expected shortly. When the food came it looked great. However. My salmon was undercooked. The center could have been served as sushi. Again the waiter and then manager were both apologetic and offered a replacement meal, etc but at this point I am put off for the evening and will eat when we get home.   When the bill came, all they had done was remove the meal I didn't eat. After the wait and the inconvenience this is grossly unacceptable.  I was excited for the potential of this place but we definitely won't be returning.",

    "text": "I had a fantastic time the first time I went on Valentine's Day. The waiter checking up on us, even the manager stopped by to see how everything was. I decided I was going to have my birthday dinner here a couple weeks later. I bragged to my friends about this place and they were all excited. We arrived with a group of 9 and they had our table ready about 10 minutes after the reservation which is normal. The waiter took our drink order and took 30 minutes to bring it back out. After we had to remind him of drinks, we had to ask if it was okay to order and he said oh yeah. We started off with appetizers and he brought that out 15 min after which was fine. He did not take our order still for the entrees. We had to waive him down and ask him if it was okay to order food finally after we had finished our appetizers and our drinks. He never asked us for more drinks or if everything was okay. We had to share waters because they were never refilled. Our order came out and he never checked up on us. My scallops were SO SALTY. I thought maybe it was just me but I had the others taste them and the same thing. The waiter never came back and checked on us so that I could tell him. We had to waive him down for our bill. We asked if he could split my bill amongst 3 people and he said this would not be an issue. He brought back my check and every single person was charged something different. How is this possible!?!? He did $22 on one bill, $19 on another and $12 on the last one!?!? We tried to wave him down to see what happened and he never came back so we just bit the check and left. Terrible experience for my birthday and even more embarrassing since I bragged to all my friends about how great this place was. If he can't handle a table of 9 on his own maybe management should have sent someone to help? Sad to say I will not be back. They get 2 stars because of the first experience. Otherwise it would have been a 1.",

Another excellent meal, with outstanding service.   They told us there was now a North, here in Las Vegas.   We went there this past Tuesday. What a disappointment!  The people were just going through the motions of service. While running by us, they asked how we were doing, without listening for a response.   Plus we both ordered pasta dishes. They were terrible. I would rather go to Olive Garden.  Plus, with how bad the food was, it was pretty expensive. I would not mind the cost at all, if the service and food were anywhere near the quality of their Tucson branch.   I would strongly suggest going to a different restaurant for Italian food!",

The food was nothing you want to say, \"I have to come back again\", unfortunately...especially for the price, I expected more. I ordered Bolognese, Daily Special Pizza, and Calamari. Bolognese - just the usual Bolognese and was not wowed by the sauce. Calamari was good - different which I liked (tossed w lemon vinaigrette with arugula). Daily pizza was sausage and broccolini with white sauce - again nothing special. Felt like I can find other Italian restaurants that has their \"house special\" sauce or better service. It is a pretty restaurant though. Sorry - I really tried to like this place like other reviewers..",

He knew the menu and all of the specials. The ambience was laid back and casual. The decor was innovative and fresh. I had their Strozzeli, which was a pasta dish with spinach, chicken, mushrooms (omitted) and a white Parmesan sauce. My girlfriend had the roasted chicken with corn. Both dishes were superb. The portions were perfect (not too little and not too much). The restaurant location was good right between Charleston/Rampart. There was plenty of parking. I think the layout of the restaurant quite new and refreshing. The entrance was completely open with outside seating, that could be viewed from the inside and out. I'd highly recommend checking this restaurant out!",

We were all excited. Parking was packed and from far away you could hear the noise from inside!!! The restaurant was full from entrance, Covered and heated patio, bar area and restaurant. the covered patio has a very nice fire place, love the decorative azulejos that reminded me Portugal the  restaurant is very modern, trendy. Even I loved the decor... if you like a quiet Romantic night ... North Italian is not the right place ... it's loud loud :( We got our table quickly. I could barely hear the hostess, not sure if she even care LOL Our waitress was polite but not very sharp on her service :( It's pricy and I surely expect an excellent service what we did not received. Had to ask twice for water refill, we ordered couple appetizers and she missed to bring our bruschetta prosciutto. We enjoyed it at the same time as our meal. We ordered a round of aperitif Champagne, Apricot Lemonatta (didn't taste the apricot) Sicilian margarita. Cocktails were great. White truffle garlic bread (amazing made of fresh bread), Buratta excellent, refreshing, colorful just delicious and prosciutto bruschetta with grilled asparagus. We ordered the Strozzapreti with pine nuts, spinach, mushroom and chicken. It was delightful but next time I will order it with no chicken or have them serve it on the side. The chicken killed the dish in my opinion. The bolognese with tagliatelle pasta, I tried and like the creamy bolognese not too tomato tomato. Perfect amount of ground beef d carrot. Buratta tortellini... mushroom is my peche mignon :) it was maybe 8 tortellinis in my bowl with some sliced mushrooms and couple leaves of spinach. The dish was okay. The Bolognese was our favorite! We finished our dinner with an expresso served like in Europe :) Ask for sugar before your waitress leaves because she might not come back lol I think we were the last to leave and what a pleasant time we had when half of the restaurant left!   experience ... so so  If you like A good Italian, i recommend ROMA deli on Spring Mountain and Jones. It's not fancy but the gastronomy is closer to Italian Grand Ma cooking ... If you want fancy go To North Italia",

It's busy but from the people at the bar it's ok.... make it amazing and give decent portions and offer bread! Let the manager perform magic! He appears extremely customer centered and amazing! Listen to his requests!",

If that's your thing great, but to welcome me to a classy restaurant, sorry no! Second the staff was not accommodating at all. Barely checked on us and barely knew the menu. The food was bland and nothing special. Since this is northern Italian food I expect it to be some what different than southern Italian food which tends to be more flavorful and robust! North Italia reminds me of a place for millennials to hang out with and try to be cool. There are so many new Italian places in the area that I would never have a reason to come back here. Pricing wasn't bad, portions were ok but bland Italian food is an oxymoron!",

First, I started out with a dirty chai drink which was exactly what I needed in my life. It had espresso, almond milk, and chai over ice and it's definitely worth getting if you are in the mood for a coffee beverage. For lunch, my mom and I split arancini, calamari, and the vegetable salad. The arancini is basically a fried mushroom risotto ball and it is DELICIOUS! I would go back just for these. The other items were so tasty as well. The pizza and pasta also looked so good, but i just wasn't in the mood for all of that during lunch. Everything is fresh and you can definitely tell. My waiter was Winston and he was so friendly and helpful with the menu. I know I will be coming back to this restaurant all of the time. North Italia is the type of restaurant that Summerlin needed.",

We had the Margarita Pizza and the calamari which was wonderful. The Pizza a crisp and tasty. The calamari was different from what we are used to but I have to say it was light and refreshing. We then ordered two different pasta dishes, mine was the short rib,and it melted in your mouth, the pasta was cooked perfect and the light horseradish cream was a perfect bite when put all together. The other pasta was grilled chicken with mushrooms, spinach, pine nut, with a light cream type sauce, it was light and fresh and the combination of it all was perfect. For dessert we got the Italian donuts on top of a lemon sauce they were so light you could eat them all and not realize it.  Our waiter Oscar was attentive and explained everything to you. He gave some great recommendations on what we might like and as you can read above he was right on point. If you are looking for a great Italian place this is it! A must try! We are so glad we went and looking forward to returning there soon.",

Accompanied by nothing.  No bread, no salad, no vegetables.    The place has been open 6 weeks and the newbee local customers pack the place.  Will North Italia sustain a customer base?  Doubtful.  We enjoyed the food.  It was very good -- not exceptional.  A cast of twenty in the kitchen produced half our entrees after waiting 20 minutes.  The balanced arrived 27 minutes after ordering.  The service by M was defined by our 10% tip:  inattentive, slow to respond to a request, forgetful.    Not sure if a \"manager\" was around.  Not one person asked if we were enjoying our dinner.    And not sure if I will go back considering Olive Garden, Carraba's, Marc's Trattoria and others offer a similar if not better value and experience.",

I ordered the chicken parmigiana, it was the best I ever had. My husband is Italian and is extremely critical of Italian food at restaurants, he agreed it was the best we ever had. He had the bolognese pasta and asked for a side of sausage, which was not on the menu.  The side came late, but both were excellent.  They comp'd the sausage.  Coffee and the salted caramel budino were excellent as well.  The waitress did her best to make up for the initial tardiness and in the end we were very pleased and will go back.    We went back for dinner and I had the same chicken parm it was so good.  Hubs had the rosemary chicken, which was delicious.  The cranberry marscopone was to die for.  In spite of the excellent food , they still need to pick up the service level.  We were done with the appetizer by the time we got our cocktails.  Btw Hub's manhattan was excellent.  The coffee was old and cold...should have been tossed.  The refill was perfect.  Both women's restroom stalls were out of tp!",

I heard my neighbor table tell the same waiter that she was upset for her wait time and how he ignored her his response was \"oh darn, I've just been so busy with other tables.\" Finally cherry on top of this excellent service is us asking him for clean plates and he brings us 3 plates when we were a party of 5.

Thankfully, we were served right away because we opted to be seated outside. It was windy and cold, but thank god they had covers that made prevented the draft from entering.   The ambiance was romantic with many guests dining in with significant others. But this was also enjoyed by friends and family as the room was filled with muffled chats from everyone.   Our server was overly friendly as she helped us order our food and checked on us pretty frequently. They really cared that your beverage is filled to the rim so they often came back to refill our drinks when necessary. That was quite impressive for me.   We ordered the Chicken Pesto, Bolognese, and White Truffle Garlic Bread.   Chicken Pesto: I thought the pasta was not cooked thoroughly which made me enjoy the chicken instead. But it was delicious overall. I've always thought pesto didn't taste much so I was happy to learn that they have a different style of pesto that had hints of flavor with this plate. It wasn't too salty and you can taste the hints of garlic with it. Delicious.   Bolognese: Loved the cheese and the meat sauce that went with it. It was simple but heightened in another way as I enjoyed every bite of this meal. Would I order it again? Certainly.   Garlic Bread: I've heard a lot of good things about this plate, but I wasn't too impressed by it. I understand it's made with truffle but that wasn't enough to give it that \"wow\" factor for me. I also thought the side of cheese was a little weird as I couldn't figure out if it was indeed cheese or butter.   Also, serving the garlic bread was delayed as they gave it to the other table next to us. To our surprise, they apologized for the mishap and made a fresh batch, free of charge.",

We popped in after an afternoon golf session and enjoyed the chefs board 5/5 which included a plethora of delicious options including: prosciutto di parma, artisan cheese, marinated eggplant, roasted peppers, castelvetrano olives, marcona almonds and some apricot marinade. There were also some small pieces of bread with a little oil that go well with the plate. One great combination is a piece of bread, the apricot marinade and a marcona almond. Mmmm can't wait to come back.   After our first round of drinks we ordered a couple more Sangrias and tried the house specialty bolognese 5/5! The house made noodles were delicious and were served with plenty of sauce. Lastly, we tried the grilled cauliflower which was served with fried egg on top, cauliflower, baby asparagus, toasted breadcrumbs and a delicious pancetta cream.  Only regret is that we didn't save room for dessert :(, gives us something to look forward to our next visit.  The service was great 5/5. We sat at the bar and were catered to the whole time.

    "text": "We had the mushroom pizza and the Bolognese with fettuccini style pasta, both were very tasty and enjoyable. It was a take out order that turned into a \"lets eat at this empty table at the bar since we are already have drinks\" type of deal. Speaking of the bar: they needed one extra person back there for a bar that size and it being within the 6-8pm drinking hours for Vegas.   The ambiance was lively and they had a bit of a wait for a table inside so id suggest making reservations on their website if youre coming any day around 6-8pm.   Join there ebite club for $10 off a $20 purchase. Id go back considering their service,  quality and price point.  Hopefully one opens closer to the Strip considering Town Square doesnt have a southern Italian restaurant and lets be honest Brio is a bit tired.",

    "text": "This Italian style eatery is located inside the rampart commons shopping center right next to Pottery Barn. This petite corner strip mall is lined up with affluent boutiques along with a couple dining options like Honey Salt and PF Changs.  We enjoyed the fresh, modern vibe and the outdoor covered patio looked like a fabulous place to dine when the weather cooperates. Indoors, they have open windows lining the back wall giving us the perfect view inside the kitchen at all of the bustling chef action. The service was very friendly from start to finish. But unfortunatly, most of the food we tasted was lacking flavor and love.   I wouldn't come here with high expectations for anything in particular. I also feel that the cuisine fits with New American/Italian fusion at best.  Their price point didn't match the way the plates were served; I was not thrilled with the presentation of the food. Value is hard to find here, especially when you have a lot of local, non-chain, Italian restaurants to choose from.  If I had to recommend something, try the arancini mushroom risotto balls and make sure to save room for the tiramisu, this spot adds clusters of crunch balls to the top which gives it an addictive texture.

Rita was our server, and she was absolutely lovely. Attentive, prompt, and very sweet, everything you could want in a server. The main courses took a little while to come out, which was fine because it was obviously very busy, but they gave us complimentary dessert anyways! The food was something else... chicken parm was gloriously indulgent. Perfectly cooked chicken, the crust was just right, the tomato sauce was tangy and delicious and the rigatoni noodles with white sauce were a wonderful compliment. The pistachio olive oil cake was amazing! Real pistachio peices added a nice crunch and the tang of the strawberries complimented the density of the olive oil cake very nicely. We will be back!!",

The calamari appetizer has a different spin than most with a light tempura batter and a lemon glaze that gives it more zip than your usual plain breaded calamari app.  Was a big fan of it.  Comes on a bed of arugula for some extra greens.  I love me some arugula.   We also split the prosciutto Pizza which was I thought was really good, but nothing to rave about...BUT my girlfriend thought it was the best pizza she had ever had in her life.  She's a big fig fan and a lover of prosciutto.  The goat cheese always makes everything good.    The missus got the chicken pesto and despite my waiter telling me that my order of short rib radiatori was his favorite by far, I have to say that the chicken pesto was on par.  It was really good.  The Sauce us heavy leaving you feeling full and satisfied...and guilty.   My short rib radiatori was just like the chicken pesto.  Excellent.  Very filling and satisfying.  A heavy dish for sure.    Desserts were both really good.  Tiramisu (hard for tiramisu to be bad, no?) and a hazelnut torta I think it was.    A great new Italian addition to summerlin.  We'll be back for sure.",

I ordered the Tuscan kale salad which was light but flavorful and had great texture to keep it interesting. My group ordered the meatballs, arancini, breakfast wrap & egg sandwich - all was pretty delicious apparently.   Unfortunately, our drink order was lost so we ended up getting our food before our drinks came out. Our server immediately apologized and rushed to get our drinks out and even comp'd the first round. The manager (I'm assuming) also came by our table, apologized and again assured us our drinks would be on the house due to the inconvenience. After the initial shortfall in the service, they more than made it up to us which was really appreciated and actually saved the trip. Even though the food was delicious, service can really make or break me wanting to come back (especially with all the other great brunch spots around town). Kudos to the manager in acknowledging the mishap and making our dining experience great after that. I've already recommended to my brunch friends and will be back soon for dinner or another brunch outing.",

The first time I had the pasta bolognese, which they make with their homemade noodles...perfection!  The second time I ordered their burger...and again, it was perfect.  The only problem, is the parking lot is so small and there are all those new restaurants that opened up in the same location, so at times, there is nowhere to park.  We were going to go have brunch here last Sunday, and couldn't because the parking lot was full, and there were so many cars driving around waiting for a place to park.  Anyway, not that it's their fault...just mentioning that.",

It took them about an hour or so (peak evening) to seat us.  They have an assortment of pastas and pizzas. The margarherita pie fresh from the oven, the squid ink pasta has a spicy kick with a nice portion of calimari + shrimp.  There was a mixup of one of our friend's dishes ans had to be sent back. The response time was prompt and understandable given how packed it is. Seems that the workers met the challenge with success",

    "text": "Our first visit to North Italia was on Father's Day and it was busy! Wow! We had reservations for 6:15 and our table was ready on time.  There were so many people there and it was absolutely filled with families enjoying their dinners.  Our server took our drink order quickly and appetizers, heirloom tomatoes and cucumbers and grilled artichokes were delicious.  No bread though.  They did take a minute and the manager came by too apologize.    We were with my husband's parents and together managed to order the same thing, Bolognese for the ladies and chicken parmigiana for the gentlemen.  The waiter suggested ricotta for the bolognese and said he'd bring a little out for us to try.  I ordered a side of meatballs as well for my husband to try.    It was taking a bit of time and the manager again came and apologized for the wait.  The food came out shortly thereafter sans meatballs but they were brought out quickly when we asked for them.  Three smallish meatballs.  They were really good though.  The bolognese was very good and needed nothing.  It's cooked with sausage as well so if you're not used to that, it might bother but I thought it was very good.  The ricotta addition gave it a lasagna component.  The chicken parmigiana was amazing! The chicken coating was nice and crispy and the chicken moist and tasty.  The pasta combined with the chicken was the perfect bite.    We really enjoyed ourselves and were happy with everything we ordered.  We just wish there was some sort of bread to sop up the remaining sauce from the bolognese.",

The crust was a little soft, even though I asked for it well done, but the toppings and flavor were top notch.  The salads are definitely the star for me though. Came here for lunch with the wife one day and was not super hungry, so didn't bother with a full meal. Salad sounded good, so I had a caesar with grilled salmon added. Oh boy, this was delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly, the salad was crisp and fresh. My only complaint is that they were a little short on dressing. I've had this salad on three visits now, and unfortunately they're a little inconsistent with serving size. Twice was good and the most recent time I felt like I got a \"lunch portion\" even though I was billed the full price and didn't ask for a lunch-size portion. Salmon was still the proper size though! And still delicious.  I'm glad this place is so close to me. I don't eat out often for lunch, but this is one of my go-to spots now.",

    "text": "To say I was disappointed with my meal and service quality at North Italia is a vast understatement. This past Saturday a friend and myself decided to call in an order and take it to go since her husband was still at home and it's about 30-35 minutes away, we just happened to be over that way.   We order on the phone and they repeat it back to me and everything sounds great, they say it'll be 25 minutes and we head over to pick it up. Once we get there they confirm our order again and give us the receipt to sign and all seems good. We ordered two different pasta dishes, the scallops, and the bread appetizer. We leave and get back to the house, again, 30-35 minutes away and the appetizer and two pastas are on top with the scallops on the bottom. Everyone's food looks ok, then I get to the scallops. I asked for no butternut squash and to sub for asparagus, which the receipt said again that it was subbed. Upon opening the container, the risotto part of the dish was missing entirely from our order, so right there half the meal is missing. They still put the butternut squash in as well, and the Brussels sprouts weren't actually Brussels sprouts, just the ends that when cooking you usually discard because they're too fibrous to chew through (I included a picture of the Brussels sprout ends, which were the only thing included).   So, basically I got to pay for a full entree to only get 3 scallops and a few asparagus and nothing else to eat. I called them to see if they could potentially put me on a list or something to have the entree remade at a later time, because again, I'm 30+ minutes away and driving back would be ridiculous. I didn't want a refund and I wouldn't even have written this review if something like that was done but they just apologized and asked if I could drive back to get the missing component of my meal.   Based on their reviews and people saying everything was good I was excited to try this place and upset that my experience wasn't the same. Just prepare to be disappointed if you order to go.   **UPDATE: The manager messaged me wanting to make it right and I tried to reply but the email he gave me wasn't valid and he never replied to my message so I guess my review stands since I won't be giving it a second chance due to the flaky communication",

There is indoor and outdoor seating with a bar both inside and outside. The only downsides I could find were the long wait time and the short close time. the wait, on average, is about 20-30 minutes. Not too bad when considering the great service and food. The restaurant closes at 9 pm which is kind of a bummer but eating early is worth it!",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. I went recently with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary and was presented with dissatisfaction. My lovely girlfriend ordered a chicken pesto, chicken on the side (she is vegetarian and wanted to give me the chicken) and I ordered the simple salad with salmon. The waitress was quick to take our order; however, the dishes took quite a bit, which is understandable considering how busy they were on a Saturday night. About 25 mins later, we received our food  and we both dived in. My girlfriend began eating and then said, \"I don't know what I ate, but I hope it was cheese.\" A few bites later she asks me to try it and I told her it was chicken. She was extremely upset considering the pasta was $18 and it took very long for the food to be delivered. I, on the other hand, enjoyed my salad with salmon. I was tempted to call the waitress and complain since my girlfriend is vegetarian and there was chicken in her meal. It's understandable that the kitchen was overwhelmed with the amount of orders coming in; however, it is utterly unacceptable to have something in your food that you specifically asked for on the side. I had high expectations for such a highly rated and expensive restaurant.",

    "text": "I would love to give this place 5 stars but I will explain why I can't at the end of this review. I first tried this place in Austin, TX. I had never had fresh in house made pasta. It is truly life changing!!! Ok, well not life changing but definitely changed my ability to have pasta any other way. It even has convinced me to buy a fresh pasta maker and get my pasta making on! When I found out it was going to open locally in Las Vegas in December I made it a point to go the day after it opened, 12/13/17.  We went for a friends birthday. I made reservations and made sure to tell the hostess. When we entered the restaurant they asked who's birthday it was and said happy birthday to my friend. Figured we were good to go with some kind of dessert at the end. Dinner was fantastic. We were all impressed, even my friends father who said \"he is not a pasta fan\". My only reason for deducting a star is that the birthday somehow got lost in the transfer from hostess to server. She did not acknowledge it at all. Those little things mean something and are a huge miss when you make it a point to take someone out on their birthday, especially when you've raved about it. Maybe it was overlooked because I didn't bring in any obnoxious balloons or gift bags. It took me a few months to get time to write this review and in reading some reviews it seems the majority that aren't perfect are coming back more on staff and customer service than the food. It's sad because it really beats out places like Nora's that does not do fresh pasta but bad service will deter anyone even from the best food. Hope they get that together! Other than that, recommend!",

Then it was on to prosciutto and fig pizza and filet of beef.  Both were really outstanding.  Dessert was an almond and mascarpone tart.",

The inside of the restaurant is open and lively. The vibe would be great for a brunch with friends or a date night with your love. In addition to a large indoor dining room they have a large outdoor patio too.   Since I was dining with two foodie friends we dined family style and were able to try quite a few items this way. Our waitress informed us that everything is made in house and this was evident in the flavor of everything we enjoyed.   Arancini- mushrooms added a nice touch, the risotto was perfectly cooked, and the red sauce had the perfect flavor Margherita Pizza- loved the flavor and texture of the crust with the fresh ingredients, would definitely order this again Strozzapreti- the homemade pasta was delicious and perfectly prepared, all of the ingredients worked well together, and the flavor of the parmesan cream was delicious Chicken Parmesan- a large chicken cutlet with more delicious red sauce and a great tasting parmesan rigatoni on the side, loved this dish and that it came with both red and parmesan sauce on the plate Lemon Donuts- so much yum, the texture was light and airy with a little vanilla cream inside and delicious lemon sauce to set off the flavor of the donut Almond & Mascarpone Tart- the dessert of my dreams, creamy and the perfect amount of almond flavor with delicious cranberries and oranges to round out the flavor  I'm already dreaming of my next visit!",

Highlights are any of the pizzas ($10 during happy hour!), the strozzapreti pasta, any dish with short rib, the filet with crispy potato and burrata with grilled bread.  I love the open atmosphere, the large outdoor patio which is perfect for when my little chihuahua joins me!

I loved the decor, and that there is an option to sit inside or out with a covered patio and heat lamps when it's chilly. We opted to sit inside on a brisk December night, and I slightly regret it due to the noise level. The acoustics in there aren't the greatest and everyone's conversation just bounces off of the brick walls.   Our server was less than delighted to be there, and acted like we were a waste of her time, but we hardly had any interaction with her so it wasn't that big of a deal.   The grilled cauliflower with a sunny side up egg was really good as a starter, and we both ordered pastas for dinner. I had the mushroom tortellini which was REALLY heavy, I'm talking like-- your calories for the entire day rich, but definitely worth it with the butternut squash and sprouts that accompany inside. I'm not a huge pasta person so I didn't care for my date's bolognese but he loved it.   We ordered the salted caramel bundino for dessert and it was 100% worth it for the finale of our dinner. I wouldn't order the merlot for dinner it was pretty bad palate wise, but for $10 you can't really complain. Aside from the noise and service, I'll most certainly be back to try other things on the menu!!",

While I usually visit for HH, the menu is full of great options from apps to desserts- their sea salt caramel bundino is a must-order for me, and their pasta portions are large and shareable. So far, I have yet to try the pizzas but they have a featured daily special each day with seasonal produce. I also hear rave reviews about their truffle bread. Location is gorgeous, opt for the patio if tables are available. Staff have been really great about accommodating tweaks to orders due to dietary restrictions, which is really appreciated.

Not too oily though which is usually my issues with pesto sauces.   Spaghetti & Meatballs - Best I've had, honestly! The spaghetti was a thicker size which I love and the sauce had a sweeter taste (but not too sweet!) The tomatoes were so fresh and sauce was light.

The Manager was incredible, I didn't get her name but she was a beautiful expectant mother, who made sure our party was taken care of and seated as soon as could be. She brought over a few appetizers on the house due our table not being available due to nothing under their control. (A few young gals were sitting there texting long after their table was cleared and bill paid). We had reservations but we sure didn't mind drinking the great wine while waiting.  Our server was incredible, Kaye made sure all 7 of us had anything we needed and when one of the pizzas came out wrong she immediately brought us another and then gave us another comped appetizer. I must have interacted with about 5 people that worked there and each one of them was so helpful, kind and prompt. I stood at the bar to pay the check before my friends could and the ladies at the bar were swamped yet they both asked if they could do anything to help me! :) I said, \"Oh, I'm being taken care of but thank you so much for just asking!\"  This was a Thursday night and the restaurant was packed but we never waited for anything we needed.   I had to write a review because having an entire restaurant staff with these great of attitudes and customer service needs to be recognized. I can't thank Kaye and the other managers for everything they did for me and my friends.  Thank you all for making my b-day celebration so incredible and delish! (Wine and bread was incredible)   Also, this was my first time here and we will hold all future fun events and gatherings here from now on.",

    "text": "LOVE this place! I'm so excited to write this review because I'm so happy there is an amazing hip Italian place in Vegas. We came last night around 6 for dinner, and it was super lively inside. They have a beautiful outdoor patio seating that takes up nearly half the restaurant, and the whole restaurant itself is open air. I would describe this place as elegant and rustic.   We got the Garlic Truffle Bread w/Ricotta Appetizer and omg this was so good. The bread is well coated in olive oil, retained the crunchiness and softness of the french loaf, and was bursting in flavor. The homemade ricotta cheese with it was a really nice touch and added a coolness to the bread.   For our main course, we got the Squid Ink Madaldine. I honestly wasn't wowed by this dish for the fact that the pasta itself was too al dente for my liking and the pasta flavor was overpowered by the mint leaves. The spicy tomato sauce itself was really delicious, but I think it needed more of it.   We also got the Funghi Pizza, and WOW this pizza is legitimately so delicious I kept commenting throughout dinner how yummy this pizza was. The crust is really nice, but the star of the dish were the perfectly cooked roasted mushrooms in the olive oil and mozzarella. It really tasted as though truffle oil was used, and I'm a huge truffle fan. So pretty much, you need to get this pizza.   For Dessert, we got the Tiramisu. It was so fresh and yummy, and actually comes in a pretty large portion (enough for 2). I really liked the crunchiness of the chocolate balls on top, adding some nice texture.   The service here was also top notch. I was greeted by the GM and checked on multiple times throughout dinner. I'm in love with North Italia.",

And the pistachio olive oil cake was out of this world",

The food was trendy good and the service was excellent. The only drawback was the extremely snooty/rude blonde female bartender. This place has so much going for it I'm sure they should be able to find someone a LOT more pleasant hence the 4 stars instead of 5. And one final note; their website states that weekend brunch is from 10 to 4 however the rude bartender abruptly told us they didn't open until 11 and to sit on the bench and wait.",

I had their breakfast option of veggie scramble with toast and potatoes! Their roasted potatoes are to die for. They look like small little hush puppies. Their French toast dish was wonderful too. Everything was well seasoned and good portions. Not overly abundant on portions which I prefer. My gf had their bolognese signature dish and it was really flavorful and the pasta was cooked al dente. The kids menu had nice options and tasted great. We had the crispy chicken with fries. It was plenty for the 3Yo. Their only item I was not too overly excited about was their salted caramel gelato. It was ok.",

I had a table waiting for me. I asked about a wine and the waitress said she never had it and offered a taste of it and holy cow...that took 20 minutes and then another 20 to get the bottle and another 30 for the food. She kept blaming a back up at the bar...which was seriously empty so i would hate to see what a weekend night that's busy would be like.   Outside of the slow and undesirable service...the food was top notch. This restaurant would make it on food alone and it might just be so good that it would compensate for the miserable service.   The waitress asked if we needed boxes and obviously sees we have a pizza and realized after she brings tiny boxes that....yeah pizza...doesn't quite go in a tiny box. I'm not sure what kind of experience she has in restaurant....but she really needs some training.   I think the front of the house needs work to really nail this. If this restaurant flops, it's because of the front of the house. The food is impeccable. We had some amazing food. A little disappointed that they were out of meatballs though...but every dish was amazing.",

The first thought that comes to mind with this place is definitely the appetizers, which have been so good that I have contemplated not ordering an entree (just a fleeting thought, of course).

We had the Chefs board and the truffle garlic bread to start. Both were good. The truffle garlic bread was the star of the night! I would recommend this appetizer for sure.  Dinner for me was the \"House specialty\" Bolognese. Not impressed at all.... sorry... Chef Marc's Bolognese is FAR superior!!! I love pasta and didn't finish my entree...

Our server was attentive and funny and definitely checked up on us unlike my last experience. We ordered the daily special for both the pizza and soup. Both dishes were so hearty and delicious. We ordered the Potato Spinach pizza and seasonal butternut squash soup. It was such a perfect combo for this cooler weather we are finally having. We sat outside and the ambience was perfect: Warm pizza, hot soup, chilly weather and great conversation :) The ingredients were fresh as per usual. Again, I left not feeling overstuffed and yucky. Highly recommend to at least give it a try since it looks like management is making an effort to improve their service.",

The lunch menu had a lot to choose from. One of my friends has a few dietary issues and they were very accommodating. Our server explained the menu and was very helpful in ordering. Our food came our exactly as we requested it.   They have gluten free crust for the pizza, one of my friends choose this and it looked amazing- she said it tasted great! I had the roasted vegetable salad which was super yummy and very filling, my other friend had a green salad with salmon.  Our server was awesome, super fun and very attentive. I will for sure be going back :))",

Our table shared the chef's board which was amazing. Great starter. And in fact, my favorite dish today. We each ordered something different to have a taste of everything.   The squid ink mafaldine was delicious. Wish it was real squid ink sauce but handmade pasta will do too. The sauce was flavorful, slightly spicy, and more water than saucy.  The Bolognese has had great reviews on here and was recommended by friends. Though it was tasty, I thought it would be better. Maybe all the hype just got to me. Don't get me wrong, the dish was great. But I want to say I've tried better!  The strozzapreti was a pleasant surprise. I totally wasn't going to order it, but my friend did. The truffle flavor was perfect. Just enough salty and savory to do the trick.   The Today's Omelette was also yummy. The crispy potatoes were a hit! Along with the truffle bread. I didn't have too much of this dish but my husband enjoyed it.   And of course, all the pastas were perfectly cooked.   There's so much I want to come back to try. Though brunch ended up pretty expensive, round 1 here turned out great! Definitely coming back.",

Do not expect anything if you visit later at night like pass 9:30. 1-2 servers running around between the patio and inside while you have 3 bartenders.

    "text": "Seriously one of the best venues on the West side! Was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews regarding the slow/bad service, especially since we were going on a Saturday night,  but we took a chance and are so glad we did!   5-star food, service, ambiance and plentiful parking to boot. Our server, Keith was friendly, fun and efficient. The whole team worked together to take care of all of the guests (not just their own tables)  and made our dining experience (as well as the tables around us) a fabulous one.    The food ... what can we say .. DELICIOUS!! Large portions, very reasonably priced. Everything we tasted (Calamari, Chicken Pesto, Salted Caramel Budino) was great and we will definitely be back .. a lot!",

We ordered the bruschetta with tomato off of the happy hour menu. The house made ricotta and tomato jam were awesome. We ordered another after we ate the first.  My wife ordered the chicken pasta strozzapreti . The pasta Was house made and very flavorful. The pasta had mushrooms and pine nuts in it. I had the short ribs with polenta. That dish was out of this world. We finished with the salted caramel Budino. The portion sizes were perfect, our server was awesome. We will be back very soon.",

    "text": "Omg please stop!! This place is a train wreck. From the moment we arrived we were told Five minute wait which turned out to be a 20 minute wait. Then we were seated at a table and we proceeded to order a glass of wine. The glass of wine had a object in the glass which looked like a critter but we were told it was sediment. We're also asked if that made us uncomfortable that they would give us another glass instead. Then the calamari came that we ordered and it was smothered in a bed of arugula salad to hide the fact that there were only a few pieces of calamari . We ordered a Caesar salad since we were told this place is like a French restaurant which uses only the freshest ingredients in their salad dressings and their fresh pasta (repeated each time a new customer arrived #annoying) when the salad arrived  we had just started eating it when our pastas was delivered. No one seemed to care as the wait staff seemed to be very unorganized and ill trained. As we started to eat the pasta we realized that both of our dishes which were separate dishes I order the squid ink pasta which came with the smallest over cooked shrimp (reallly) and my husband ordered the chicken pasta dish with the cream sauce. Both dishes had a Marie Callender feel to it nothing felt homemade and there was absolutely no flavor to it!!! Remember when you go to this restaurant that there is no bread served at the table and there is absolutely no ambience to the place. I had not touched my pasta dish but I was asked if I needed a box. They immediately sent over a small McDonald's burger Styrofoam boxes and we were to put our own leftovers in our boxes and walk away sans a bag. Having lived in Vegas for over 25 years this is probably the worst place we've ever been to. If you want some really good authentic Italian food go to Marks Tratoria which is not a food chain it is a local place with real fresh pasta and no one ever says is like a French restaurant. PS overpriced food that is served Luke warm.",

    "text": "My wife had been wanting to try this place so we went for an early Mother's Day dinner with our young daughter.  We made a reservation and were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  The hostess was very nice and gave us a couple recommendations as we were being seated.  The place is a little loud but nothing new for Vegas restaurants and the decor is pretty cool.  We ordered our appetizer and drinks first and took a little time deciding on the main course.  After we ordered our main course it seemed like everything went into warp speed.  Our appetizer came out about 30 seconds before our main courses which we did not appreciate.  Our waitress would disappear for long stretches at a time.  I was never asked if I wanted another beer or if my wife wanted another drink and our waters were refilled once at the at the beginning of the meal and they went empty after that.  The next time the waitress came by she started picking up plates that still had food on them that we were still eating and we had to tell her to stop and put them back.  Talk about feeling rushed to get us out of there on a night where we just wanted to relax and enjoy a little family time.  The unfortunate thing is that we did enjoy the food, I had spaghetti and meatballs, the wife had pesto pasta and my daughter had a kids pizza, but the poor service and the feeling of being rushed put a damper on the night.  Its pretty bad when you feel like the server could care less about your dining experience at their restaurant and just wanted to turn the table.  As I said earlier we did like the food but it will be a while before we go back again if we do, too many other places to go with much much better service and dining experience.  It is very unfortunate because we did like the food and the atmosphere.",

The hostess was super friendly, the ambiance was nice-not stuffy. The outdoor patio looked super inviting and cozy. We opted to sit inside because it was windy and chilly. Our server (I wish I remembered her name) came straight over and took our drink orders. She was friendly and gave us several suggestions throughout our meal. I wanted to try both pizza and pasta, so My firiend and I ordered a pizza to share to start and each ordered our own pasta dish. We chose the Pig pizza-pepperoni, sausage and soppressata. It came out quickly and was hot and delicious! The crust was perfect and the sauce just right. The pepperoni had some heat to it. It was perfect. My friend even said that it was the best pizza he'd ever had. Next, we decided to order some calamari. It came on a bed of arugula with a lemony vinaigrette on top. It was perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and tender inside. Yum! We ordered our pasta (even though at this time we were getting stuffed!).  I ordered their specialty the Bolognese and my friend ordered the Strozzapretti pasta. They were both outstanding. We decided that we needed to try the dessert, so we both had a couple bites of our pastas and decided to box the leftovers. Our sweet waitress suggested the Budino for dessert (a salted caramel pudding like dessert). Wow! It was amazing. I was tempted to lick the jar but held back. Lol! All in all, it was an excellent meal and we both agreed that we would be coming back soon!",

    "text": "I went there Saturday night with my wife and 3 granddaughters for the first time.  Very disappointing !!!  After placing our orders I noticed that the waitress made no attempt to bring any bread to the table.  I finally asked our server if bread was available and she said yes and brought some over.  5 pieces of bread for the 5 of us.  Gee thanks.  After we finished our bread she came over and removed the bread plates and \"NEVER\" OFFERED TO ASK IF WE WANTED MORE BREAD\".  THIS IS AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT, RIGHT? Bread at an Italian restaurant is part of the eating experience.  I can only imagine that she was following some restaurant protocol where bread is not offered unless asked for and then give as little as possible in order to keep costs down.  But wait it gets better.  When our meals arrived my granddaughters portions of their kids meals were BIGGER than my wife's and my dinner portions.  My wife's $25.00 order of scallops consisted of 3 half-dollar size scallops,  3 tiny pieces of squash that could fit on a spoon, and maybe a half cup of risotto.  My Bolognese pasta dinner, the restaurant's signature dish, more closely resembled a side of pasta you might get somewhere else.  We were done eating before our granddaughters.  The funny part about the whole meal is that on the menu there is a section called \"small plates\".  Since my \"main course\" was so small I can only imagine that the small plates must come with a magnifying glass.  There is a restaurant a few doors down from this one called \"Honey Salt\" WHERE YOU CAN GET A MUCH BETTER EXPERIENCE AND THEY BRING AS MUCH BREAD AS YOU WANT... WITHOUT ASKING !!!",

    "text": "We (2 of us) went on a Friday night and it was packed. It was a 30 minutes wait, which isn't terrible so we stayed. Usually when we wait we go and grab a drink but after standing at the bar for what seemed like an uncomfortable amount of time with no one acknowledging us we gave up and went to wait outside. We asked a few of the hostesses if there was a way someone was able to get us a drink while we wait and she said our only option was to wait at the bar. We had already tried that with no luck. There was quite a few empty tables so I wasn't sure why there was a wait. After the drink situation I wanted to leave but I knew my boyfriend had wanted to come here for awhile so we stayed. I noticed that a lot of people that came after us got seated before us. I was getting pretty upset but I thought maybe it was due to them having reservations. I was going to get up and ask but then we were seated. Obviously so far my experience wasn't the best but the reason I still gave it 4 stars is because I thought the service, once we sat down was so great! The entire staff works so well together! I've never been to a restaurant where everyone helps each other out the way that they did. Everyone was very nice. Our server was Laura (that's what the bill said so I hope that's correct) and she was great! Always up-selling (which worked!) and she did her job so well. Never got overwhelmed with it being so busy so definitely give some props to her! The restaurant itself is really pretty, trendy. Food was good. Overall, I would come back and I would recommend to friends but if you can, definitely make a reservation or go on a weekday.",

She was taking a carry-out order from a lady standing in front of me, then she answered the phone and promptly asked them to hold, and then explained that they would be on hold for approximately five minutes as she was \"busy\". A group of ladies entered and approached her to say they had reservations, and she asked them to wait so she could assist me since I was next in line. I noticed the hostess area was consistently packed with people \"waiting\" to be seated, throughout my lunch. Clearly, backup is needed! The food and drinks were all tasty: Milano Mule cocktail, Acqua Pana Water, a non-alcoholic  cocktail, an espresso, kale soup, caesar salad, calamari, and tiramisu dessert. Unfortunately, a hair was found in the caesar halfway through lunch. The waitress apologized and offered a new caesar salad, which we declined. Then the manager/supervisor on-duty came to our table to apologize and again offer a new salad. Which we politely accepted the apology and declined the replacement salad. I suspect most people decline a replacement due to the feeling of nausea caused by finding a hair in the meal. Overall, there seems to be some kinks that need to be worked out. Please insist on hairnets during all food-prep activity. Hygiene is imperative.",

We had the hamburger which was cooked to perfection but not liking the taste.  May have been the tomato jam.  Asked for the potatoes for my side and they mistakenly brought a green salad. Took a while to get the exchange but let me tell you they were good. Smashed pieces of potato cooked to a slight crisp, salty and with fresh Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The bacon and egg pizza was different but not something I wouldn't crave to come back for.  Second trip the Italian farm salad was oh so good. Pieces of greens, meat and goodies cut to just the right sizes and the dressing was fantastic.  It was a rainy day and I was looking for something comforting so we ordered the meatball sandwich. Didn't hit the spot. Got those scrumptious potatoes again. The Margherita pizza was kind of plain. You would think with a simple pizza you would have tomato on this pizza. Sauce just didn't do it.  Even to try the happy hour looking a bit limited.",

Not even a \"how are you, I'll be right with you\".  10 more mins go by, both bartender and barback continue to walk by us, serving others and making drink tickets. I had to interrupt him and ask for 2 draft beers. It seemed to be a bother to him. After we had sat there for 20 minutes.  I had to ask someone to order, I had to ask for each beer while they continuously provided horrible service, even had to ask for my tab, a togo box.   Ordered a pig pizza to start, waited 15 mins then ordered 2 pasta dishes. It all came out at the same t  Not one single time were we asked did we need anything, how was the food, etc. And we're right in front of you. Me and a friend, $100 tab with the worst service I've had in Vegas. Won't be back.   The food was good, service was horrible.   Update: Food was great, great atmosphere. Not too busy for 5pm Friday.

Their bolognese was very True to what we had in Italy. Another must try is the short rib radiatori. I've never had a white creamy pasta with fresh horseradish on it! Completely new, crazy, amazing flavor! It was a long wait for the food and drinks, but the place was crazy busy and the food definitely made up for the waiting.",

I had the squid ink pasta, it comes with Calamari and shrimp. I checked the pictures of that dish on yelp before I ordered, and everything looked the way I wanted it. The flavor was delicious but the portion I thought was little plus the shrimp doesn't suit the recipe, since they used the smallest size shrimp. That shrimp could be bait for fish! I was really disappointed when I saw the shrimp, and I compared my dish with the pics on yelp, it doesn't look the same. I was really excited about the restaurant.l, but I will not go back.

    "text": "Excellent!  I was a little nervous walking up to this place. We were starving. It was jam packed. And, I was sure we would have a crazy long wait. I was wrong. We were greeted and seated right away.  The restaurant was clean & bright with a bit of that industrial feel. Our server, Tyler, came over right away and took our drink order. We weren't given any kind or bread or anything. I don't know if it was a fluke or if this is something they just don't do. Our drinks took a bit of time to arrive. Not long enough that we were getting upset, but long enough to notice it. I felt like this wasn't because the service was lacking, but more a result of how busy they were.  We had planned to order pizza, but other menu items had us at hello so we opted for 2 entrees. My husband ordered the Bolognese ($18) and subbed  Rigatoni. I opted for the Red Wine Braised Short Ribs ($26). Both were excellent! The Short ribs we flavorful & tender. Served with Marscarpone Polenta, Swiss Chard, Carrots, & Fingerling Potatoes. The accompaniments were as delicious as the ribs themselves. I'm not a huge polenta fan, but this dish made me want to lick my plate!  For dessert, we had the Bombolini ($7) which are served with a vanilla anglais & lemon curd.  Again, not a dish I would normally gravitate to, but it was calling to me and I'm glad it did. These little donuts were light and lovely. The perfect happy ending to our meal.  I'm already planning my next visit to North Italia! I am excited to try some of their pizzas, especially the Prosciutto w/ fig & goat cheese and the Bacon & Egg w/ roasted potato, garlic confit, & rosemary. I'm, also, looking forward to the Zucca Chips & the Arancini.  North Italia has a great vibe. The food is excellent & service is laid back and friendly. They are in a great location, and clearly the word is out! My biggest complaint about this place is that it is WAY across town for me so I can't go nearly as often as I would like.",

We did not make reservation but the wait was not long at all for how packed they were. Our waitress was awesome! So friendly and informative, the whole wait staff was very attentive, drinks were constantly re-filled, food came out quick, dirty plates were promptly picked up, no complaints regarding service at all.   We started out with a few appetizers cuz friends were hangry! Grilled artichoke was good, dipping sauce was bomb! Garlic and truffle bread...need I say more? Must try. Grilled cauliflower was average, I didn't think it was worth $12, it was very sour and didn't have much flavor other than that.   Now the pastas...so so good! I got strozzapreti and even though my stomach was full my mouth wanted more! I never had pasta shaped like that also so it was a fun little surprise, the flavor was awesome, so cheesy but not overwhelming, great pasta dish! My friends got tortelloni and bolognese and both were delicious!   For dessert we got cheesecake, tiramisu and donuts and oh my lord! All were very good but the tiramisu was my favorite! It was one of the best tiramisu i have had in a long time!  Definitely recommend this place for date night or casual hang out. Nice vibe, lovely open kitchen concept, modern decor, and delicious food!",

No time to look over the cocktail menu, the waitress just stood there looking at me. Iced tea came to mind so she could just leave! Iced tea came, but no sugar or anything.  I asked for recommendations for small plates, but she was all over the place with her suggestions. I went with my original order of burrata and squid ink pasta.  I was observing the male waiter who was attending a couple in front of me as I waiting for my food. His service was on point! Straws for beverages, water to start off, bread and butter, etc...when I compared that waiter to mine, she should have been a runner.    The food was great, the service was off.",

    "text": "Cute place for Italian food. Quality food without the hefty price tag. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Order the mussels, crispy calamari, arancini  balls, pepperoni pizza, bolognese, squid ink pasta. Mussels were a nice light broth. I asked for Squid ink pasta not to be spicy and it was very delicious, not too heavy on the cream sauce either. The crispy calamari seem to be fried in old oil as it came out a tad dark. The pizza was very greasy. Half of my crust was trenched in the grease which I wasn't pleased with ......I would recommend this place and will come back and try other food on the menu.",

The food was good but nothing was spectacular. Their calamari was to bready but the addition of the arugula was nice. We also ordered the zucchini chips and truffle garlic bread which were both good as well.   For my entree I tried the squid ink pasta which was tasty but not the flavor that I was looking for. It was Spicy which I like, but it overpowered any of the seafood flavor that I was looking for. My husband had the chicken parm which he liked. It came with Alfredo rigatoni which was a little different from the usual red sauce pasta that it usually comes with. The portions are bigger than Ithey look like in the pictures. Definitely enough to fill the belly. Oh and they have local beers on tap which I thought was a nice touch.   Would probably come back for a nice friends dinner.",

    "text": "North Italia is a locals Summerlin spot for solid Italian food and a hefty number of \"adult beverages\", to include imaginative twists on the same, such as a \"white sangria,\" which is not even on the menu--you have to ask for it. You're welcome.  But we came strictly for the food. Sunday night family dinner. The offerings are good. The dishes range from the elegant, a Branzino with white pearl onions and broccolini to the more casual, a mushroom ('funghi') pizza. There are meatballs for an appetizer, as well as calamari, and salads. Even though the menu is not especially large (a welcome change), you should be able to find something you enjoy on the menu, whether vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, or good old-fashioned carnivore.  We thought the salad was very good. I have forgotten the name, unfortunately, but it did have pine nuts if that is any help. (And I might have a photo of it). It veered a teeny tiny bit into the \"overdressed,\" category, but that's quite alright. It's like someone wearing a sundress to a backyard barbecue. ~~ Perhaps it might have been a little better to have just come in jeans, but you're not going to kick someone out for that, and besides the effort is appreciated.  The other dishes didn't wow us. The meatballs in the appetizer were fine, but a little bit underseasoned and a tiny bit dry. The sauce they were in was splendid, though. Chunky and rich, fully ripened tomatoes, that seemed almost homemade. A little salt did it right up!  The pasta bolognese was bland, sadly.  The meat was imperceptible. The fish was cooked fine, but could have used more acid (in the form of lemon or whatever). Branzino is not an oily fish but with the olive oil added to the dish (which was fine), it needs something to break it up.   The desserts were 50-50: Tiramisu and the Gelato/Sorbetto were ECCELENTE! The tiramisu came with these little chocolate bead balls (that taste a little like Kit-Kats) that really add to the traditional dessert.  The Salted Caramel Budino and the Hazelnut Torta were just cosi-cosi, in our opinion.  The former was too sticky and sweet, and the latter was too dry and sweet. (And the little chocolate beads were not enough to save it).  All of the desserts come in a very unattractive wanna-be Mason Jar, that's not a Mason jar...in a wide jar/cup reminiscent of a plastic cup you might get at a cheap cocktail party or a frat party.  Our tiramisu had some paper receipt underneath it and then a saucer.  Very weird.    Speaking of which...  We found a piece of gum wrapped in plastic and sticking out of the bouquet when we sat down. We noticed it immediately, but didn't say anything. We of course expected someone to remove it, but nah, that didn't happen. Eventually, we pointed it out to one of the servers (we seemed to have a couple, in addition to our main one, a very nice young woman), and she cleared it away. But can we say, \"Gross?\" And a little inattentive to detail on their part. A clean table is a must. So a little more attention to details would go a long way.  On a positive note, the decor is hip, modern, and unimpeachable.  The idea of an indoor-outdoor kitchen is smart and worth a visit in itself.  I hear they have a good Happy Hour. Might return to try some of the plates again then.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here on the recommendation of a friend who knows eating out very well. I had never heard of North Italia before but they have 13 locations, three of which are in Southern California....oops. Anyhoo, North Italia is located in an extremely busy strip mall off of Rampart. The interior is very cool. The bar separates the inside & outside and you can see into the kitchen through the glass. One thing I have to warn you about is that it gets extremely loud inside the restaurant. Like, by far the loudest restaurant I've ever been in. If you take someone here on a date, you might take this into consideration beforehand.  We started our meal with the prosciutto bruschetta and it was phenomenal. The grilled asparagus they put on it makes for something different but very good. For the main, I went with old dependable. The chicken parmesan. And boy, it's a lot of food. You get two good size cutlets and a side of parmesan rigatoni. Everything was perfectly cooked and the combination of the intense flavor of the chicken with the more easy going rigatoni was just right. Like fire and ice.   Service was very good. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about both the menu and the drink menu as my friend put her through the paces regarding their wines. Beer selection is also great. Lots of local and non-local craft goodies for your palate. Also, be aware there will be a wait on peak days. I went on a Thursday evening and there was a line outside the door. If you're looking for a place to eat with friends with tasty food and a pretty fun atmosphere, North Italia is a great choice. Whether I'm in Vegas or in So Cal, it's an option I won't say no to.",

It was absolutely amazing... we were seriously impressed with the quality of food. I wish my love and I would have taken our servers recommendation for the chicken parmesan because it was so tender and delicious! We order the bolognese it was good but I've had better. The chicken parmesan was something else... I haven't had one that good. It's a must try and all the appetizers we ordered were all so good! The ambiance was really nice! The patio is beautiful and the interior is quaint with large Edison bulbs around the restaurant. Another cool feature is the open kitchen watching all of the cooks in action. It gives you a sense of relief when you can see the cooks through the windows handling your food with care. Not that I'm ever worried, but it's kind of a cool feature. If you enjoy Italian food this is a no brainer go check out North Italia.",

My friend recommended this place for happy hour, which was from 3pm- 6pm, and our server recommended some delicious appetizers to start right when we got seated.   When we moved on to dinner, I had ordered the burger and my friends ordered two different kinds of pizza; margarita and I think the arugula pizza. We all shared, and everything was sooo good! We were so stuffed by the appetizers that we had a lot of dinner left over. And let me tell you... every bit of that left over was not going to be a waste!   The server was so nice, and if I only remembered her name I would give her a big shout out. All in all, I really enjoyed this place, and this was a really good place to catch up with friends.",

We were given menus and ordered a couple of things.   The bruschetta was just ok, the chef's board was really skimpy with just a tiny amount of proscuitto and cheese on it.  The cauliflower was good, but the egg was way overcooked on top (rubbery and could barely cut it).  We were surprised when we got the bill that the items were not priced as happy hour - $18 for the chef's board was ridiculous for the amount of food on it!  Apparently, you have to order specifically stating the happy hour bruschetta and chef's board?!?  Would they have been smaller yet for a reduced price?  There are much better happy hours in town, so I suggest you skip this one.",

They were more than happy to explain the menu and the different drinks/wine they had.  Everything in the restaurant is fresh and made from scratch daily. The bolognese was my favorite!

The mains; branzino, short ribs, squid ink pasta, chicken parm, chicken pasta and short rib pasta were also excellent.  Desserts rounded out the great meal.

The two bar tenders who are married are also my two favorite people in the world.  They have amazing red sangria AKA it actually tastes like wine and isn't overly sweet. I say just get a pitcher instead of a glass because YOLO.  I am a bruschetta hoe and I really liked their more savory version with prosciutto and asparagus. It was a very satisfying bite of food.  The pasta dish featuring pesto was also delicious. I love the strong basil taste. It wasn't overly oily and was very fresh tasting. You can tell by how vibrantly green it was that it's made fresh.   The bolognese sauce was just amazing. The pasta was just perfect. This pasta you can tell was made fresh. There's a time and place for fresh versus dried pasta and I just thought this was perfect. It wasn't overly cheesy. The cheese just helped the salt but main that deep meaty flavor of the bolognese was just one of the best pasta dishes I've had. No crazy extra things just a slow cooked well developed meat sauce.   I've had the affogato and the hazelnut dessert and they were both excellent ends to the meal.  Price was very fair for the food quality and my I can't make this at home factor lol  The space is open, bright, modern, and spacious. They don't have everyone crowded next to each other which I love. The bar seating is also great.   I always consider if I'd return to a place when deciding what I rate it and this place is a solid five. North is definitely in my top three favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas.",

It makes for an awkward intimate conversation.   I had their \"BOLOGNESE (HOUSE SPECIALTY)\" dish. It was fairly blah. For what they label a \"house specialty\" dish, I expected a bit more flavor.  My leftovers did heat up nicely the next day. And I even liked it more reheated. Maybe it was rushed in the kitchen and didn't have enough time to settle? I'm not a chef, so I have no clue. But it did taste better the next day.  Now I will tell you their Seasonal Vegetable salad was amazing. Started the meal with that and was so eager to try my main dish. But it fell flat. Maybe I had too high of expectations after the great salad?  Overall, I give this place a B---it's above average mostly for the lively space (although don't expect an intimate conversation).   I'd give it a second shot.",

No bottomless mimosa specials, but all bottles are 50% off so you can get a bottle of Prosecco for $22 and ask for a carafe of orange juice for a few bucks. Service was great even with our group of 12 people!",

Their unique and amazing food is amazing and the employees are so nice to me there. Did I mention a good price range? For places that are usually located in nicer areas with good food and atmosphere, the price is not too shabby (not too cheap but not rooftop high prices). I have to say there is nothing that I dislike here.  Here are a few of my favorite so far:   Appetizers:  Proscuitto bruschetta  Crispy Calamari   Pastas:  Squid ink mafaldine  strozzapreti  roasted mushroom tortellini",

What we ordered...  Chef's Board: For someone who doesn't eat much meat and dairy, I was still able to pick off this board. The Marcona almonds, roasted peppers and marinated eggplant were delicious. My boyfriend loved all the meats.  Squid Ink Mafaldine: I enjoy spicy food but the spiciness of the Calabrian chili sauce was too overpowering, and I couldn't taste any of the other flavors.   Service...  The kitchen was busy and the food was taking longer to come out - not a problem, considering how busy it was. Plus, the manager and our waitress came by several times to check on our table and inform us on the status of our orders.   Other...  Words of advice: Make reservations in advance, especially on the weekends. This place was jam packed on a Friday evening. Also, be prepared for a noisy atmosphere and the possibility of having to yell over all the noise if you're dining with others.",

My husband had the roasted chicken and it was a little on the dry side but full of flavor and our son had the a pasta with meat bolognese and didn't even see him take the first bite when he was done with it. The best part for me was the prosciutto bruschetta appetizer and the Italian donuts Meyer lemon curd. Last the margarita pizza was a hit. Service was excellent. Nothing bad to say.

I kept it simple, less carbs the better! Lol I know it's carb heaven, but a girls gotta do, what a girls gotta do.   I ordered the Cesar salad and the appetizer meatballs, last time they were really good so i figured I would just grab the same thing! They do give you free bread as well.   Meatballs were delicious and the fresh bread as well. I was a little disappointed in the Cesar dressing though, I do not remember it having such a fishy taste. Last time it had bit more of a garlicky taste, which was fabulous. I didn't get to indulge into it the way I had envisioned. Maybe it was just me, or maybe this is how they make it, which isn't to my liking, but I swear last time I was just perfect.   Still I do think I'll be back again, for another date night, or even girls night! I'll have to try the pizzas next!",

But let me explain  Food: 5 stars We have tried several dishes and all have been full of flavor.. leaving you wanting to come back  Atmosphere: 5 Stars I mean who doesn't like covered outdoor dining options in Vegas?! This is a nice patio that flows thru the bar.. a few TVs for live sports at the bar and plenty of heaters for the winter  Service: 1 star The hostess seem to be more concerned doing their side work (making menus) than taking care of a paying customer. We were quoted 10 minutes for a patio table (the patio was empty).. meanwhile the hostess just made menus. This wait was all because someone needed to \"make up\" the table (salt, flowers, ect)  Our server was absent, and really inattentive to our dining experience. Lastly, the staff decided to retract the patio screens at 20 minutes before they closed.. ignoring that we were still eating! Guess we didn't want to finish the meal and have dessert in the ice cold..  We really love this place and hope our next experience is better",

What started out as a good neighborhood italian eatery and bar has turned into a poorly managed mediocre restaurant with close to NO service at all.  The pizza was similar to a frozen pizza from the grocery store and I looked at the frowns on my friends' faces as they ate the pasta and salads they were served.  I'm sorry, but this place is going to be gone in no time...bye.",

Our group of 8 ordered several appetizers, calamari on a bed of arugula was lightly battered and lemony delicious, meatballs, zucchini chips and grilled cauliflower. Each was so delicious and tasty! The dinner was even better from the homemade pasta dishes, salmon, short ribs and the pea soup was amazing.   The service was fantastic.  Our server was friendly, attentive and offered suggestions of favorites which is always nice when trying to decide.  As expected for a newly opened place it was packed and yet the service did not suffer for it. We liked the atmosphere and watching the open kitchen through a big window was fun to see.   Although we were full we saw desserts being served to our neighbors and had to order. The tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had! And the Bombolini (Meyer lemon curd donuts!) were light and fluffy and delicious.   We can't wait to go back for Happy Hour on the patio to order the Chef's Board.",

Beautiful interiors, excellent food (roasted cauliflower, Pepperoni and corn pizza sprinkled w arugula was fantastic and authentic to northern Italy). Service was just just middle of the road as our waiter felt new, inexperienced by that did not stop us from enjoying a wonderfully delicious lunch and tipping well. We struck it up to restaurant being new. Wine list prices were some of the Best I have seen in Las Vegas for both bottles and by the glass selection and pricing.  Highly recommend.",

We told the hostess we would sit at the bar since the restaurant was about 20% capacity and why not enjoy the view. We somehow confused the high tops next to the bar. We sat there...and sat, and sat. It's not that nobody saw us because just about every server made eye contact with us INCLUDING the hostess. Apparently, if the staff purposely ignored us we would get up and ask for the table. Instead, we got up and told the hostess we were leaving. We walked a few feet away to Honey Salt and got the service we were looking for.",

We had couple cocktails and 2 bottles of red wine, they were great. Good quality both drinks and food and also the service! All staff were super friendly and very fun to talk to. We met a male bartender named Polloh(sorry if i spell it wrong) but yeah he was awesome, took a good care of us and had a sexy italian accent lol we loved it here.

As you walk in there is a huge outdoor patio that is heated during the winter with a lakeside backdrop. The place inside is huge! Our waiter was awesome and explained everything that was a favorite on the menu. I love truffle so we ordered the truffle garlic bread with fresh ricotta cheese served in a skillet! It was flavorful and a good size, along with it we got a tomato bisque. We ordered for the entree Chicken Pesto pasta and tortellini pasta! They were both great dishes but the only con was their portions are so small! I wish they had bigger portions especially because the food is so flavorful. For dessert we opted for the hazelnut Torta, it had rich chocolate flavor and to soften the taste the hazelnut makes it the perfect flavor combo. We will be back to try other dishes.  5/21/18 UPDATE STILL amazing, we were able to try happy hour and they have the best around town, everything is priced great and the happy hour menu is delicious! What I love about this place is that their pasta is made fresh and handmade here at the restaurant.",

I expect their quality as exclusive to much smaller joints, so definitely give North Italia a try if you're craving Italian! The service was also great, with genuinely kind and attentive staff. Loved the funghi pie and even recommend the basic, but well-done and nostalgic spaghetti and meatballs. Zucca chips are a must have starter too. Will be back!",

Our server seemed very friendly and was upbeat with a smile. We all ordered appetizers and main courses everything seemed to be fine. Place was very busy. Then it went all down hill.   1st the server had forgotten to bring the drinks we had ordered. While trying to get his attention numerous times he would just past on by. After flagging him down. Wed ask if he'd put in an order. He initiated \"you never told me\".   2nd They had dropped the wrong food at our table and we were asked are you sure then frowned at for being sure it wasn't our item.   3rd Dirty glasses were never picked up or asked to be refreshed. It just sat there. Until we asked for them to be removed. I had asked for a refill on my drink and he had forgotten that too.   4th He cleared our table and asked if we'd like to see a dessert menu. I wasn't able to order another coffee before he disappeared again.   This is what tops it all before we could order dessert he drops the bill!  He never asked if we wanted another coffee or order dessert.   He never seemed to check in as often or wouldn't stay at the table long enough to put in any other orders. While we watched him walk constantly around the restaurant not doing anything. It took another server to recognize we were not happy.   We gave him the benefit of the doubt he was probably having an off day. But seriously? We are never to return. We were offered a gift card to return but left it on the table. It could've been handled differently. He could've just brought us dessert.",

We ordered the calamari - and it came tossed with arugula. I don't think we read it in the menu, but maybe I didn't pay attention to it. My son ordered it, and they staff were kind enough to remake it without the arugula. We should have just canceled it. Without the marinara sauce or some sauce, it's just that - deep friend breaded squid. We wouldn't order this again.  I had the veggie salad and the grilled branzino. The branzino was $27 and it was good, but not $27 good. I'd get it again but not at that price. I think I'd go to Nora's and get a whole one instead.   The veggie salad - I read it had faro, but it seems it also had quinoa. It was mushy with the avocado and the grains. The only vegetable besides the lettuce was small pieces of cauliflower. I definitely would not order this again. I don't know... maybe we ordered all the wrong things.   We ate it, but we left going, what's the hype? On the people side, they were super friendly attentive. I think if you're in the area, and you want to have a relaxing meal in a nice setting, and you want to try something other than Claim Jumper, PF Changs, and Chili's, this is a nicer atmosphere with a feel of more stylized food.",

The place was cold and drafty inside. You can choose to stare at two televisions or a wall loaded with boat propellers hanging on it. The ambiance was not worth the price of admission. There are just way too many dining options in this part of town to settle for these prices. We headed over to a more reasonably priced Giordanos Pizzeria instead.",

Very quickly our drink order was taken and we had regular tea which was very tasty (like the best part of the meal in my opinion).  We also opted for an appetizer of a grilled artichoke for $13 - which was 3 half artichokes grilled.  Tasty, but nothing you wouldn't get down at the claim jumper across the street for much less.  They also brought out bread which was cold out of the fridge with some butter.  For dinner, I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs were pretty good but the pasta sauce is among the least spectacular I have had in a long time.  I don't want to say this, but the dish actually reminded me of Chef Boyardee spaghetti.  I feel kind of guilty for writing that, but unfortunately, it's True.  Having said that, my wife had Burrata Tortelloni and it was good for her - she liked the spicy sauce.  Finally, the portions were very small for the price.  2 Teas - Great 1 App - Good but not wow'd 2 Pasta Entree's - One not good, One Good (so, mediocre)  with Tip $70  Although there were a few good things, this is a \"one and done\" place for us.",

    "text": "Went to north Italia with a group of friends Saturday night. We made a reservation and when we arrived, the place was pretty packed at 9pm. The decor is super sleek and cute inside. We were seated shortly after ordering drinks at the bar. Service was pretty good. Since I think this is a new location, they are still training staff.   Our party of 8 almost ordered most of the menu. For appetizers we got the arancini balls and calamari. I liked that the calamari came with arugula because it made it lighter but that dish was a miss for the table. They were expecting just calamari and more of it. The calamari was crispy but it didn't come with any dipping sauces. My friends said the arancini balls were just ok.   I ordered the funghi pizza. I love mushrooms and this pizza was very very good. It had great flavor and they were pretty generous with the mushrooms. The only complaints were that the crust is too big and thick, and the pizza was on the greasy side.   I also got to try some of the chicken pesto. It's very flavorful. The short rib pasta was good but the meat was a little stringy. I did enjoy the Parmesan cream sauce though.  The diver scallops came on a bed of risotto with butternut squash. The scallops were very juicy and big. It could have had a crispier sear to it. The risotto was good but overall the dish is on the sweet side.   The atmosphere is great and the food is satisfying so I'll come back again!",

We ended up arriving right as happy hour was ending and we were lucky enough to find a spot at the bar. The bar atmosphere is amazing, as the bar opens to the outside which gives you a great opportunity to enjoy the patio vibe. The place has a beautiful ambiance!  I started with a cocktail, and ordered the Julietta which is ginger infused vodka, vanilla, st. germain, lime and prosecco. This was such a fun cocktail and very tasty. I highly recommend it!  For food we started with the Chef's Board which includes prosciutto, artisan cheese, marinated eggplant, roasted peppers, olives and almonds. This was a great starter and shareable item. The bread that came with the Chef's Board was a little to crispy, and could do without it being soooo toasted. When then shared a Margherita Pizza, the basil was fresh and there was a good amount of mozzarella.... so you can never go wrong there, came out hot and delicious.   I was a bit disappointed when I went to order a glass of wine and they seemed to be out of every options that I asked for. I was wanting red and all they could offer was white, so I ended up getting the last 2 ounces of a pinot.   Overall the food and atmosphere are wonderful! I know that the restaurant is still new and I can hope that the attentiveness of the service will improve. The staff were all very friendly and kind, but lacking attentiveness, and would forget drink orders all together. Although each time they were very apologetic, it was a bit exhausting. (and when we tried to sympathize by saying this must be a really busy night they responded with no, this is actually slower than normal for a Friday)",

From the open kitchen where you can have a personal look at your pasta being hand made, to the great service from the entire staff, to the desserts that make me never want to diet ever in life, this place has it all covered.  Between my visits, I've tried quite a few dishes. The bolognese blew me away, truly one of the best I've ever tasted. The salty crust on the salmon was very unique and flavorful. And the salted Carmel budino is my new favorite sweet snack! I'd also suggest ending your meal with an Italian coffee.  This place is good for date night, family dinner, a ladies outing, or even a solo dinner and glass of wine. In the nicer months, they offer outdoor seating.  As much as I love Honey Salt in the same lot, I'm worried this place may have just taken the spotlight when it comes to semi-fine dining.",

    "text": "Oh... how I wanted to like this place. Maybe we got unlucky and came on Bad day? But how bad of a day could it of been when all bottles of wine were half off? I genuinely was excited to try it. It's location is convenient, the ambiance is cute, the patio is awesome, and the kitchen is behind glass so you can see everything that is happening. I'm giving two stars because I'm being generous... and will try it again and hopefully update with a stellar review... but for now all I can leave you with is this...   The service lacked in every which horrible way possible. It took over 10 minutes before anyone even noticed we were there. It wasn't our server, it was a manager. I got over it. We got some waters and ordered a bottle of wine. And spaghetti for the little guy because he was starving. He said he was going to bring out some bread while we looked at the menu... it didn't come. Our server came over and said he was also going to bring out the wine we ordered and before he could walk away, the manager had the bottle opened and poured. It was confusing because I didn't know which one was our server at first. We asked for the bread five minutes later again::: they said it would be right out. I informed the server when he came back (still with no bread) that I was vegan and wanted to try something with no dairy or animal product. He made some suggestions and we settled on the heirloom tomato and burrata. I didn't get to try the food because when it finally came out... it came out full of cheese:( I sent it back... we still didn't have bread on the table and I was over it. We finished our bottle of wine and management came over to apologize. They seemed sincere... I didn't want to get the server in trouble (probably a bad day)... we said we would be back... and we will... hopefully with a better updated review.i",

    "text": "I've been to North Italia a few times and have always spoken highly of the restaurant and posted on my social media to recommend the restaurant (even my profile pic is from there lol). I work at a hotel on the strip and am constantly talking to my colleagues about it because they love the restaurant as well!  However, after my most recent visit, I am unsure if I will go back.  My friend made reservations for 5:45pm on 2/2 (Saturday).  I ordered the same thing I always order for myself: a glass of red, the truffle bread, chicken pesto, and the affogato.  This time, my friend and I decided to try the mussels.    I did not eat anything else after and went home since our dinner ended around 7:20pm. When I got home that night, I could not stop vomiting and using the restroom.  I was told I had food poisoning from the doctor's the very next day. I figured the mussels were what got us because it probably wasn't cleaned thoroughly.  Please keep in mind I don't have any allergies to anything.   North Italia is always packed at night so I understand if the kitchen gets hectic but I don't agree with rushing out items when they are not fully prepped.   I am unsure if I will visit again at the moment since I am still recovering.  2/6 Update: Tim (manager) contacted me at around 8:35am to follow-up with how I was and that alone took me by surprise. He then offered to send me a gift card to my address which he didn't have to at all. I truly appreciate the guest service.  3/2 Update: Gift card received!",

The ambiance is awesome with a farmhouse feel to it: bronze salt & pepper shakers, wood top tables, comfy cushy chairs, even the uniforms are a farm feel but it works!  I immediately asked the server for vegan options and even though they don't offer a separate menu for those items, he was able to point out my options with making some adjustments to them. For my meal I had the   Tuscan Kale Salad (remove the cheese and parmesan vinaigrette dressing) and he replaced it with another dressing and it came with grapes and apples. It was awesome!!   Special of the day Vegetable pizza (hold the cheese) came with broccolini, crispy eggplant, mushrooms, roasted red peppers on a gluten free crust and it was AMAZING!! It was a decent portion, 6 good size slices and I ate every single one loving every bite   The bf ordered the tomato soup of the day and the scallops. He loved every moment and our meal was complimented by a glass of the Riesling, pinot grigio and a makers old fashion.  The service there was awesome from being greeted at the door to our server and food runners. Everyone was so friendly and if something wasn't right, they would do their best to accompany the request. Nick was our server and even though was very busy, never left us hanging for service.   Definitely check out this place and also in the same shopping center they're opening up a sister location called the Flower Child which looks to be a farm to table concept. Can't wait!",

    "text": "My first visit to the newest Italian hot spot in Summerlin was as good as it gets... \"I'll be back\" -Terminator (T-800 model)  Service: We sat at the bar on the side that's outside the indoor dining area.  The weather covers were down because of the recent rain and the outdoor heaters were on to keep it cozy.  Our bartender/server was fantastic! I wish I would have gotten his name.  Food came out promptly out of the kitchen during a very busy happy hour.  We ordered more food after happy hour, during the dinner rush and the service didn't falter.    Happy Hour Menu: The Chef's Board had Meat, cheese, veggies, bread, nuts, etc was pretty to look at and very tasty.  The Margherita pizza had a thick crust on the edge and the cheese was great.  Sangria was mixed proportionately well of wine and juice, I would drink again, and again.  Menu Menu: The Braised Meatballs order came out with 6 and loaded with red sauce, good times.  The mushroom risotto and scarmoza cheese in the Arancini balls was great.  Deep fried perfectly and the red sauce complimented it well.  The Spaghetti and meatballs pasta was well made and this classic dish is an easy \"go to\" here.  The high quality ingredients and the preparation were key to the tasty dishes I tried at North Italia.  Ambiance:  Wooden ceilings and floors, white walls adorned with some simple decorations, and contemporary bulb lighting make for a clean minimalist dining area inside.  Outside, there's a boardwalk mural and plenty of seating when the weather is nice.  The attractive rectangular bar serves both the inside and outside area of the restaurant and is stocked with premium liquor.  I believe North Italia has been opened for just a month now? I am pretty impressed with how well they're operating in such a short period of time especially during that dinner rush I saw.  I'm going to suggest reservations would be the smart thing to do here. The menu is extensive with so many dishes to try and is now a go to restaurant for me when I'm feeling Italian.  I'm looking forward to their brunch and another dinner experience in the near future.  But that's another yelp tale...enjoy! =)",

We had to remind her to bring my husband his beer after waiting for more than 20 minutes. My boy finished his entree before our small plates arrived. We finalized our bill before our dessert finally made it on our table.  Staffing isn't an issue with this restaurant. There were many waitresses and waiters walking around.  However, only a few were efficient and paid attention to their guests.  Everything seemed to be moving in slow motion.",

    "text": "Overall, solid Italian restaurant. I spent about 3 years overseas in Italia (North Italia, north of Venice) so I first opted for the Friulano wine--pleasantly good wine. The selection of wine was awesome too and most were from Italia.  We then got the Chef's board, and it was amazing; this was about as traditional Italia as you can get. For dinner, I got the grilled Branzino and my wife got \"the Pig\" pizza. Overall, my fish was 4/5.. the setup was good but the fish was charred just a tad too long that left a slight burnt taste which impacted overall flavor and left it dry. For the price, I would've definitely got something else next time--My wife's pizza was supremely amazing--again, comparable to what you'd actually get in Italia.   Finally, my only real critique was that our waitress was not present most of the night for us; either she was assigned too many tables or was inefficient/new at handling the workload. Delayed refills and getting our food out in a timely manner.   Overall though, nothing major and I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try a new and authentic Italian restaurant.",

    "text": "Food was incredible and the only thing that saved this from being a 2-star review because service was downright terrible. Our server clearly didn't want to be there and didn't want us there either. Asking for the restaurant week menu (twice, actually, because the first time she said \"yes\" then just stood there, and when she came back she tried to take our order and we had to ask for the menu again) was obviously some kind of sin. It was uncomfortable, and this is coming from a table of four hospitality professionals who all know the deal.  Anyway, food was fab. From the awesome toasty truffle garlic bread with creamy ricotta to the delightfully bitter radicchio Caesar to tortellini and chicken parm perfectly executed, everything was YUM! Even dessert - I'm a tiramisu freak but even their delish version paled next to the amazing salted caramel budino. Oh, and the charred cauliflower app?? Amaaaaaazing.  I hope we just had a new server because it would be sad to see this place go down because of service issues. Didn't seem to be anybody in charge or at least no once seemed to notice perpetually empty water glasses, food dropped with no silverware, dirty plates sitting and sitting. Everyone was more interested in their side work than our experience, but I bet I'll still be back for the grub.  Btw - we sat inside but I loved the look of the patio. A def must-try year-round - they've got a two-sided fireplace for when Vegas stops burning like the seventh level of hell.",

Tiramisu, bundino, and hazelnut torta.   On top of all the amazing food, our service was absolutely fantastic. Even comped the birthday dessert. Hands down best meal experience I've had in ages.

The service was excellent. However, I was surprised to see this place only have two dollar signs on yelp when my lunch for two people; this is two entrees with waters, no fancy drinks or appetizers, was $40 for lunch! You have to request the bread but it does have a complimentary bread which honestly wasn't the best. I got the chicken parm and was disappointed with the rubbery feel and seasoning on it. It also came with a pasta that wasn't at all impressive. I ended up take a few bites of pasta and chicken in hopes that it would taste better but it didn't. I didn't even bother taking it home because my boyfriend didn't want it either. Definitely not worth the $40. I will go elsewhere next time I want Italian.",

    "text": "Ambiance: North italia is located in summerlin las vegas, which is one of the suburbs in Las Vegas. Rampart and charleston is the cross street, the location is situated in dining/social restaurant district since it is dotted with great restaurants and Bars, the food has to be good to compete in the area. The restaurant has a bar and dining area and is ideal for meeting up, and socializing. The decor is modern rustic, the music was a bit loud.   Food: The food had great flavors!  I ordered the braised beef pasta and my wife had the kale salad, the kids had the chicken fingers. My braised beef pasta the meat was tender  and the fresh pasta had bite to it definitely Al Dente, it was not soft. My pasta was great, I actually used the idea at home. The kale salad had the ingredients roasted, and pine nuts. Did not expect  the kale to taste good because it is kale. I was suprised that it was flavorful. The chicken fingers of my kids had some twist and it came out good flavor wise. Over all the food was good.     Service: The staff that served us, missed some request which is totally understandable because of the amount of diners that they are serving is big we had to be on the wait list for 45 min before we got seated. Again please be patient  because the amount of people that dines in north italia is huge, because its new. Sevice should improve overtime.   Overall: It's good food and would like to try the other entrees offerred by North Italia, the service should improve overtime. North  Italia is good for socializing since they have a bar to hang out, the food can be a great topic for conversation since its combinations that I did not expect to taste great but it did. Even copied the  braised beef pasta at home. I would to come back to North Italia in a few months to try other entrees. Definitely a must try if you are in the summerlin area.",

    "text": "We'd been wanting to try North for a while and finally managed to get there. We went early, around five,  thinking it would be empty and we're surprised at the number of people who'd had the same idea. You can tell once this place gets really hopping it would be way noisier than it already was, not exactly a plus for me.   I was in the mood for a cocktail and tried two from their craft menu that were recommended by our server. Both were a little more complex, and sweeter than I usually like, I'm kind of a purist. Next time I'll probably stick with what I know.    We started with the grilled artichoke and garlic bread. I do love a good artichoke, and this one surely was. The aioli was not the best I'd ever had, could have used maybe some dill, or other herb. The garlic bread was otherworldly, and you damn well better love garlic because it is seriously loaded with it. The bread was light as air and the ricotta was amazing. I finished with the arugula salad, which I also loved. The hubs had the bolognese pasta. It was good, not as good as mine, but still worth having.   Another visit to check out other offerings is definitely in order.",

The radiatori pasta with short Ribs was creamy and delicious! We fell in love with the place and plan to return for happy hour block of antipasto and bottle of wine for $20!",

The wait staff is friendly and on top of things.   1) Italian Grinder: this was sooo good. The side salad that came with it was perfectly dressed.   2) The Pig Pizza: love the crust! It's nice and crispy. The pig was a lil salty and greasy for me but still a delicious pizza. Would definitely try one of their other pizzas next time.  3) Meatball sub: didn't order this but saw one delivered to another table. Must try this next time and get the crispy potatoes!!",

We had the hazelnut torta, because it was so good the last time I was there and I wanted my husband to try it. It was just as good as the first time. I will definitely be going back.

Our server greeted us and took everyone's drink order but mine. As she was walking away I tried to order my wine but she kept walking. She checked back several times for us to place our order but we were chatting and not ready. We ordered mussels, burrata and a house salad. The burrata arrived with bread for my gluten free husband and had to be redone. The house salad and mussels were great  Unfortunately as we were having our second bites of the apps our entrees arrived. My pet peeve. The runner had a deer in a headlight look when I pointed out that we were still eating our salads. The server came over and I asked why our entrees arrived 5 minutes after our appetizers. She gave a blah blah about how she waited to put in our entrees till after our appetizers were served and can't help that they came out quickly.  Really? A restaurant should be able to manage the timing of the food. Well they said they would redo ours. Don't think so. My (med rare) salmon was like a board when it arrived. The broccolini topping was shriveled into nothing. 20 minutes under the heat lamp would do that.",

Whoever our server was didn't come by to say hi and introduce themselves or bring water or at least just acknowledge us that we were their table. My party of 2 had time to go through the whole menu, look on Yelp, for pictures to help us decide. We decided to walk out as we were both hungry and no one made any effort to acknowledge us so we didn't know how much longer we would just be sitting around waiting for some service. First time I've walked out of a restaurant. As I was walking out, up, a female employee asked if I was leaving. I said yes, I'm over it. So disappointing. Took my business to Brio down the street where we were seated right away, our server came by to introduce himself while he gave us time to look over drinks and the menu. That's how it should have been. I've been meaning to try your place for so long. I've heard and seen so many wonderful reviews about your restaurant. Sadly, I'll probably still give it another try. That's how much I wanted to eat here. I hope next time is better.",

Obviously they took too many reservations and / or sat too many people without reservations on what is probably one of the busiest dinner celebrations of the year.   This is my first visit to this establishment and will most likely be my last. It's really unprofessional for a restaurant to have no respect for their patron's time.  I'm left with virtually no options but to wait or just go home since every other restaurant out there will be just as busy tonight if not more. Shame on you North Italia!",

My husband ordered the chicken parm and it was delicious.  Lighter than the chicken parms I've tasted in the past but with plenty of flavor.  The grilled artichokes were yummy and came with a lemon aioli sauce.  I also tried the cauliflower which had light bread crumbs.  The atmosphere is sort of a farm-to-table feel.    Love this place!",

Mussels were good, salads are fresh and unique. The bar is too small for the crowd which is annoying but also adds to the cool vibe so I would not trade the standing room only for the feeling of a crowd on a Saturday night. Love it.",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and designed. They have an open kitchen so you can see your food being made which is awesome! The staff is also very patient and friendly. We came here for lunch and the place was pretty much dead. But, the next day we stopped by for dinner and the place was PACKED!  Seems like everyone must love the food! Personally, the food was amazing and fresh! All their pasta is homemade which is a major plus! We had ordered a cappuccino, chefs board, zucchini chips, italian farm salad, chicken parmesan, chicken pesto pasta, and Bombolini. We were externally pleased with everything we had ordered! My favorite was the the Italian farm salad, pesto pasta, and the bombolini. I highly recommend this restaurant and I can't wait to dine at North Italia again!",

She explained everything thoroughly and went to great lengths to make sure we understood what the restaurant was about.   For lunch I had the burrata tortelloni. I was impressed by the balance of richness and acidity the sauce and burrata had that complimented each other. My fiance had the strozzapretti. His dish was creamy but no so much that it was overwhelming. We also shared the grilled cauliflower which was light and flavorful. We could taste the char from whatever device it was cooked on and it was delectable. The raspberrycello was shared between us as an after lunch drink and it was the perfect mix of sweet and fruity.   Overall, 10/10 would recommend.",

I would define the food as chic Italian comfort food. Right now I am all about the: --Prosciutto Bruschetta because it wasn't overtly salty, bread was super soft, and I liked the asparagus which was pretty non traditional for me.   --Bolognese because the meet sauce and perfect al dente pasta is big for me.  --Baked French toast is my heaven because it's a little different with it being softer and I love berries. I didn't even need the syrup.   On a side comment I was convinced to get the artichoke cause it's seasonal. I thought I've dined many a fine places but never had to eat it off the leaf. Ask! Especially if it's your first time so you enjoy it!   1000% will be back when on this side of town for another round of cheat day...",

    "text": "I hate that I have to give North Italia 2 stars-- I wanted to love this place and give it 5. But it was just not a good experience. We went on Sunday and sat on the patio which is very nice.   Our waiter was very nice and told us all of his \"favorites\" which I found to be really funny because they were all the most expensive things on the menu. I felt like he had never tried anything but was just looking to bump up the bill. He even did this for the wine.  So we ordered the wine which was very good and the Chef's Plate for an appetizer. The Chef's Plate was just okay-- it only had a few pieces of pecorino and a tiny bowl of Italian cream cheese. Usually these have a few more options.   The BF ordered the Bolognese and I ordered the Branzino with a side of white bean ragu.  While we were having our wine and \"cream cheese\" the table next to us was having all kinds of problems with their food. Their salad was totally screwed up (all the main ingredients were left out) and when their pizza came it was also wrong. I had a bad feeling about our order while listening to this.  Our food came out before we had even finished the Chef's Plate. My Branzino was cold and totally flavorless. It also smelled very fishy. The BF even made a comment that the fish smell was very strong. It was not edible. The white bean ragu on the side was also luke warm and the beans were barely cooked. They were so crunchy. Also not edible. The BF said his was just okay.  Our waiter did not come back to check on us until the BF had almost finished his food. He would have liked to have had some Parm on his pasta but oh well. So the waiter took my food and asked if I wanted something else. Too late, the BF was done and I did not want to make him sit and wait. I def. would have liked something else, I was starving.  The manager apologized and took it off my bill. I am hoping they were just having a bad night. It's just not a good atmosphere when you are waiting for your meal and the table next to you is having all sorts of issues. I would like to try North Italia again, hopefully it will be better.",

The short rib radiatori was phenomenal (and I'm not just saying that) - everyone at my table had to try it and loved it. There is a garlic bread for the table with burrata cheese (I believe?) (I'm forgetting what it's called) that is also to die for. They also have a super delicious kale salad if you're looking for something lighter. I think this restaurant is perfect for all sorts of occasions; casual, special occasion, drinks and small bites - you can really do it all here and in style ;)",

We walked right up and not soon after we were seated right next to the kitchen.  My son had fun watching them prepare food.  I ordered a glass of red sangria & it was delish.  First we ordered the white truffle garlic bread.  It was so good especially with the ricotta spread.  When the food arrived the portions looked small but not after you dig in, it's actually a lot.  I ordered the house specialty- Bolognese & I can see why people love it because it was the best I've ever had.  The pasta is so fresh because it's made there.  My hubby & son had the spaghetti & meatballs & they loved every bite.  Our waitress was really good & made sure to come by constantly to check up on us.

    "text": "YUP.  North Italia is fancy-ish Italian food that manages to not be pretentious. I'd call it reasonably upscale. (Did I just create a new restaurant category? You're welcome world.)  Their cocktails are on point - and the bartenders are willing to modify them a bit if you're not into sugar (that's right, we keto all day and night). Same with the food, actually - don't want those starchy carbs? No problem, they'll sub in some broccolini right quick.  Everything we've had here has been solid. I won't get into specific dishes, you can chat up your server, but I've been impressed with all the food we've ordered and shared.  The only downside is that the most recent time we came here, the services was...definitely lacking. Our server went MIA for a solid 15 minutes while we were sitting waiting for the bill to come. (Hey, maybe they're trying to emulate Italy, where you have to seriously flag someone down to get the check.) Aside from that one snafu, all is well with North Italia.   It's a great place for a Sunday evening dinner with friends - not quite the ridiculousness of a Sunday Funday, but like...ok we have work tomorrow so we can't get too crazy, but I'm definitely still taking an Uber home.",

    "text": "So I am a little late to the party, but glad I waited for everyone else to check this place out first. What a great new addition to the neighborhood and a fantastic locals spot.   The Birthday Club met up to celebrate again and this was the chosen restaurant. We arrived and scored a nice table towards the back of the large and open dining space. Our server was Keith and he was ready to take our drink order as soon as we sat down. Thanks to Ania K, we enjoyed a pitcher of Sangria. So refreshing and easy to drink on this beautiful Saturday evening.   We decided to have a small appetizer and selected the mushroom risotto arancini. So tasty the red sauce was, just extraordinary. Keith let us know that all the sauces are made in house (Score!). My friends ordered the Strozzapreti pasta and the Chicken Pesto pasta. I specifically ordered the Diver Scallops served on a bed of sweet corn risotto, asparagus, crispy shallots and pancetta gremolata. I had heard that this was really tasty and I was in the mood for scallops!  This place is busy and has a choice of patio seating or indoor seating. It is loud and this is what you would expect from an Italian restaurant. The restaurant is open air but the air conditioning was working fine! I really liked the hustling going on from the staff making sure that everyone had what they needed in terms of food and drink. I sensed a strong team environment which was great to witness.  Our entrees arrived pretty quickly after we ordered and we all chowed down. My entree was so flavorful and the scallops were so juicy! The sweet corn risotto was a nice compliment to the scallops. My only negative comment is that they only gave me four scallops, very little asparagus but a whole lot of risotto. For the price, I would have expected at least six scallops. I still enjoyed my dinner but I have to confess that I was still kinda hungry when I left. My friend loved her dish the Strozzapreti which  featured chicken, roasted mushrooms, spinach, toasted pine nut and parmesan cheese. My other friend did not enjoy her dish as much which was the Chicken Pesto. She expressed it had too much pesto in the sauce for her liking. All the while we were still enjoying the amazing Sangria!  We topped dinner off with dessert of course! I had some yummy chocolate/sea salt caramel gelato and my friends enjoyed the Salted Caramel Budino. The desserts were a winner for all.   I was so glad we sat indoors as a huge dust storm hit right around the time we were enjoying dessert. We just sat back and watched everyone come inside from the patio as dust was everywhere outside.  Will I return? Most definitely! I need to try their HH and experience more of their dishes! Glad you are here North Italia, we have needed a comfortable, hip Italian spot in this part of town for a while!",

We absolutely adored our server, Gosia! She was attentive, fast, and full of personality. Although it was a full house, she personally made sure that we thoroughly enjoyed our time there and our waters were always full! I'm thankful she asked if it was our first time dining there because everything on the menu sounded amazing but she shared her knowledge with us and served as the ideal guide during our experience! We ordered the chef's board (charcuterie board) as an appetizer as it was discounted thanks to the happy hour! I had the burrata tortelloni and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan. The cheese inside of my tortellini and the sauce was out of this world. While the chicken parmesan is something you can find anywhere, North Italia's variation of this dish is the best we've ever had! I like that they served it with a side of pasta in a white, creamy sauce so you get the best of both worlds! The complimentary bread served at this restaurant is top notch as well. Our server recommended a couple of desserts, I was blown away by the tiramisu and salted caramel budino. Considering the extraordinary service and food, we will definitely return as much as possible to try the rest of the menu! I'm already planning what to try next! My boyfriend and I were very impressed!!",

They told us we would probably be seated at 8:30 because they were behind because people were not getting up fast enough to accommodate for the reservations coming in. We specifically picked 7:45 because we did not want to get home too late because we had to wake up early the next day.  Basically, we are disappointed with the service we got because the only option that they offered us for the inconvenience is that we could cancel our reservation. They were apologetic, but never took responsibility for the fact that they clearly overbooked their restaurant knowing how busy it would get.   Sadly, we really wanted to try this restaurant but we will not be coming here again due to the unwillingness to right the inconvenience that was created for us. They wanted us to cancel our reservation on Valentine's Day as the only solution! Thankfully Honey Salt was able to get us in pretty quickly and they were also very busy, so we ended up calling and canceling at North Italia without an offer of anything to compensate for the overbooking.",

The service was good and the servers were kind and on point with refilling our beverages. We didn't wait long for our food. The food were flavorful and different from other Italian restaurants I've been to. The prices were decent and definitely priced accurately for the service, atmosphere, and food. But the main reason I finally decided to give a review on this place is their truffle bread as a starter! I strongly recommend them. It was a bit too oily but oh my goodness they were absolutely delicious! I couldn't get enough of this tasty dish with so much flavor,  I am still raving about it until now. I also am a \"sweet-tooth connoisseur\" (jkay, I love sweets) so their desserts were very delicious. I definitely would visit again!   [Side note: TIP YOUR SERVERS! It's common courtesy. When we receive good service and experience, we like to tip our servers more than 20%]",

I've been here about 6 or 7 times and always have the same issues but somehow always have a change of heart to give it another try. Nope, probably not coming back again.   Today's experience:  Arrived at 3:10  Three employees walked by with \"someone will be with you in a minute\" 25 minutes later, it's 3:35 I get a drink order It's now 4:05 and I get someone to finally see us (table of two) and ask if we are ready. YES WE HAVE BEEN READY FOR OVER HALF AN HOUR  I don't know if the service just sucked for us because we are younger or because the employees simply don't care. It's frustrating when your starving and this is the service industry where you get no actual service. Two stars for the food but three missing for the crappy service. The bad outweigh the good here.   Hope this helped someone. If you're starving, don't come here because you'll probably pass out before you get to order.",

It was all delicious. The last salad and the chefs board were the stand outs.   We had also ordered 2 desserts.

    "text": "Fortunately, I wasn't real hungry when we had dinner here on April 16th with some friends. This is not, in my opinion, anything approaching what you would consider as an \"Upscale\" eatery, but one more \"strip mall chain/franchised restaurant\".  But, you wouldn't think that was the case based on the food, I was served, nor the bill presented.   While the menu describes what sounds like a typical dinner entre accompanied by some starch and vegetables (check out their menu), what you get (in a \"bowl\", not on a plate), is skimpy, at best. The food itself was quite good actually, I had the DIVER SCALLOPS which were delicious, but cooked on a grill so hot they were crusted, and a little tough.    I ended up having to order bread in order to get 40-50 Carbohydrates, a necessity.  When I indicated to the waitress that I needed to order some bread for the Carbs, she \"up sold\" me the WHITE TRUFFLE GARLIC BREAD at $13.50, versus GRILLED BREAD & GOOD OLIVE OIL at $5 (she didn't even offer this choice).   As it turned out, while I probably wouldn't have spent $13.50 for \"Bread\", I have to say that the White Truffle Garlic Bread was delicious and I probably ate too much of it.    If you've got cash to burn, the food is OK, but if you're hungry, plan on ordering lots of extras.  As for the alcohol, I can't comment on cocktails, but you can buy lots of bottles of good wine for less than they get for a glass of their House wines.    As for the pricing, we love Italian food and dine often at several Non-Franchise/Chain Italian restaurants in the Phoenix, AZ region.  All of these restaurants are equal to, or exceed the quality of the dining area/restaurant, the food, and the ambiance, but none even approach the cost of dining at North Italia.  I know the restaurant business is a tough one, and we'll just have to wait and see if this one survives.  Will we return??  TBD!  UPDATE (4/27/19): Tim Stealing, General Manager of this North Italia location (I presume), reached out as reflected in his comments posted below.  This speaks well as to North Italia's view on customer relations, and how customers view their experience dining here.  I will withhold my decision on returning here until another time, considering Tim's comments, and the likelihood that I would pass along any Gift Card to the friends we dined with here (while we visit friends here often, we are not local to this area), and wait to see what their experience is.  In response to Tim's reaching out, I have updated this Review, and included additional observations, along with correcting a little grammar.",

    "text": "My hubby and I stumbled upon this place one Sunday afternoon.  We decided to stop in for a light lunch.    The inside of this place is beautiful.  It is very open, and there is a spacious patio as well.  The kitchen is in a glass room, which is pretty cool.  Service was extremely bland when we came in.  Our server pretty much lacked a personality.  The food was also pretty bland.  We ordered the calamari appetizer.  It was served with greens, which was an interesting twist on a calamari appetizer.  However there was no sauce, which was odd.  So we asked for a side of lemon aioli.  The calamari itself was chewy, not very good.  I ordered the the bacon and egg pizza, which came with asparagus, potatoes, garlic confit, and rosemary.  The rosemary was overpowering which pretty much ruined the dish.  My husband just ordered their daily soup, which was a chicken vegetable soup.  This was the best thing we had.    Maybe we ordered the wrong things.. Who knows! But I see no reason to return.",

As we checked in we where told it would be a 45 min wait for our table. This is a poor way of handling customers and reservations. At this point we either stay and wait or take a gamble of finding any other place on Valentines Night for Dinner.  So far not off to a great start at a customer here. Only explanation is people are sitting longer. I think that sitting tables and collecting money is more of a priority then doing the honorable thing by honoring people's already made reservations. I can understand 15 min but 45 is inexcusable.",

Somehow the kitchen seems to have gotten confused with the crispy calamari. When we used to get it the arugula would be dressed but of course not the calamari and so the calamari would remain crispy. These last two times they have poured the dressing over everything and the result is very soggy calamari. The other items we ordered were also not great, but because the crispy calamari was always our favorite that was the most disappointing.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here since they opened and was able to visit, twice, within 2 weeks. The first visit was for dinner with a group of 5 and the second visit was for Sunday brunch. It seems like no matter what time of day, North Italia is always packed.  I love the open seating area and how the bar area opens to the patio. Bathrooms are well lit and clean. Tons of seating on the patio with heaters. The host never wrote down our name but was able to remember who was next and sat us within a reasonable amount of time... although they could have given us a quote. The host just said we'll seat you soon.   I wasn't offered bread my first visit but the second visit, the server did offer. It comes with butter and a side of olive oil and balsamic. What I did not like was that there weren't any plates given for us to eat the bread on. Not a big deal since we just dug right in.   The common theme here seems to be a long wait for food.... no matter how big or small your group or what you order. The most recent visit, my bf and I ordered a short rib hash and short rib pasta. It took 40 minutes for the food to come out and our server apologized multiple times. When the food came out... it was very disappointing.  4/5 short rib hash ($14) if I can remember correctly, it had a few pieces of arugula, some red peppers, 3 pieces of short rib & was seasoned very well. A little on the spicy side. The bf thought it had some chorizo in it but it didn't. The grilled bread that came with the dish was burnt so I didn't try eating it but it looked good (minus being burnt). It had grated Parmesan on top. The short rib was super soft and complimented the mashed potatoes well. The hash wasn't like a traditional hash browns, the potatoes were probably boiled, mashed a bit and then fried.   2/5: short rib pasta ($20)- my bf ordered this and we should have ordered an appetizer and a salad along with it. Not sure if they give out smaller portions during lunch vs dinner or what but it was comparable to a kids portion of pasta at other restaurants. He had 5 pieces of short rib in his pasta which I thought was a decent amount. It was garnished with arugula and shaved Parmesan. I wish our server had told us that the portion size of this dish is on the small side. Their pastas are made fresh daily so it's good! A bit chewy but not over cooked. And the sauce reminded me of an Alfredo sauce but not too creamy.  The first time I came here, my friend ordered the squid ink pasta. He's not allergic to tomatoes but had a strong dislike for it... he had one bite and decided to not eat it because it came with a tomato/wine sauce (per our server). We set it aside and our server did not offer to bring another menu or switch out his dish until after everyone was done eating! I however, did like the squid ink pasta. I love their pastas here even though serving size could be worked on.   Another friend ordered their scallops and I thought the serving size was spot on, but it was too salty for the table to enjoy.   North Italia is a good date spot, and has a really good happy hour. Pizza OR cheese board AND a bottle of wine for only $20?! Count me in for the happy hour but if I had to pay full price for their dishes... I think I'll pass.",

For appetizers, it's hit and miss on whether the one you choose will be available. I've tried and failed twice to get the artichoke appetizer and I really want to try it.  We have tried the zuca chips, which are yummy but the portion is probably enough for 3-4 people. Also their truffle garlic bread is AH-MAZ-ING! You must try it at least once! My husband had some mussels or clams and enjoyed them. You can also get a basket of bread but it's never just brought out, you have to ask.  We both tried the spaghetti and it was delicious and I felt the like portion was perfect when having appetizers too.  The desserts were ok. Nothing terribly special, the wine was good, but my husband wasn't overly excited with the beer selection. He did try an interesting coffee beer though.  Overall, great atmosphere, wonderful staff and delicious food! Worth the visit.",

I always judge how good a pizza is by if i want to eat the crust at the end... well i did, so good sign! Our amazing server entered the wrong item so the chef asked him to go ahead and bring it to us which was this awesome display of deliciousness in the pic. We then ordered the burrata cheese appetizer. I've had burrata at other places before and I will sadly have to say this wasn't my favorite. I can not place my finger on what it was that didn't work well for me with the dish, but it lacked something. We ended our meal with the Carmel dessert. It was amazing!! We literally should have ordered our own. To top it off, I love the venue super trendy and well lit. Good vibe and our server knocked it out of the park! Yes i know... i should have gotten his name.",

The space is open and fresh. It was bustling with activity inside and so I would not recommend the inside seating if  need a quiet place to discuss business or are looking for a quiet romantic dinner.  HOWEVER, they do have outdoor seating and that would probably be perfect.    My husband and I shared the Chicken Parmesan and the meatball appetizer which comes with the most delicious bread and sauce.  The chicken Parmesan was the best we have ever had. The pasta that they serve with it is creamy and delicious. This is our new favorite place for Italian and we can't wait to go back!  Thank you for opening in Summerlin!",

The food and wine were excellent.  Sadly, all of this was soured by an inattentive, unhelpful manager.  To begin with, when I asked Crystal to fix our wobbly table, she disappeared for over 10 minutes. We then fixed the table ourselves after the Prosecco was poured to prevent sloshing drinks. When she finally appeared, she was snippety with us for fixing the table. I had purchased e-gift certificates online and called ahead to confirm I could use them via my smart phone. I had been assured this would not be a problem, so I took screen shots of them. Sadly, Crystal was responsible for processing the certificates for our server and added to the awful experience by taking forever while we waited. Frankly we missed a big part of our Cirque show because of Crystal's slow service. Even worse, Crystal must have inaccurately processed one of the certificates claiming it didn't work. When I insisted she try again, it worked fine. Further, when another certificate only showed the barcode with its number cropped, she refused to process it. Crystal stated they weren't a retail store with a bar code reader. I understand if the certificates were cumbersome for her, however, she just had such an awful attitude about it and toward me that is my biggest issue. She was neither helpful nor friendly about it. Such an awful experience I actually cursed at her at the end which I never do. On a positive note, when I tipped our server in cash while leaving, she was pleasant and apologetic.",

We shared the Prosciutto Brucheta appetizer it was so delicious. My husband had the Baked French toast and I had their Egg Sandwich accompanied by a glass of Bellini, It was super yummy. This is the perfect place for a girls day out. Thank you to Jacqueline for the great service. You made our first time here a good great one.",

    "text": "The food here is absolutely amazing !!!   Had the squid ink pasta where the pasta dough is mixed with squid ink and cooked in a spicy, tomato base sauce!   The fig prosciutto pizza was my favorite !!! The mix of sweetness from the sauce and figs makes a perfect combination with the goat cheese on top!   Also had the calamari for an appetizer and it was very crunchy and tasty with that zesty flavor!   For desserts the hazelnut torta with salted caramel gelato on top, very very delicious and most of all the Salted caramel budino was to die for !!!  For alcoholic beverages , I tried the julietta (floral light refreshing cocktail ) matched well with the mussels appetizer according to the friend i dined with , the sangria was really tasty and just the right amount of sweetness, apricot cocktail  was refreshing too , and most of all the Apple bourbon cocktail was my favorite !! Very soothing and warms the insides really good and the flavor was just cinnamon and Apple and barely taste the bourbon but will feel it later .   The service was great and the servers were attentive ! Overall I will come back and dine here again !!!",

NOT COOL   Strike 2 - its my gf birthday and we would of loved a nice romantic dinner with great Italian wine upon arrival to the table the server approached us rushed and almost scared lol. (I remember my first day) given we are easy so we gave em time after almost 20min for even ordering wine the server had no Italian wine knowledge and recomened a domestic wine I forgot what it was but for 80$ I would of rather has something exotic  Strike 3 - our food was cold at this point we were just over it for being a chain restaurant  they sure choked and we almost did too with the chewy Calamari then how is a pizza even cold dont you cook it 1st ? So confused!  Chicken parm was soggy like it was sitting in sauce really disappointed for this place Will post pictures soon!!!!!  I'll have to try the new Italian place at redrock.",

But... it was fabulous  I'm going to go back on Sunday to try their Home made pasta and 1/2 price wine bottle. We told the mgr  About our excellent service and we said he was going to buy our server dinner tonight! I love that recognition.",

    "text": "We dined here for my mother's birthday and we are completely disappointed by this restaurant in so many ways. We were a party of 10 and ordered appetizers which took 40 mins to come out. It was very slow service for a Thursday night then we waited another 30 mins for 2 meals to be brought out. During all of the waiting our waiter nor the manager came to apologize for the wait and let us know the food would be out shortly. Then they brought out two meals. By the time two more meals were brought out the first two people were done eating. It's no fun to go out to eat and to wait over an hour for food and then have to watch one person eat Bc they don't want to wait any longer. Not to mention the last two meals brought out were the salads. Still no apology for the slow service. We brought our own cake and the server brought out small plates once we already ate the cake then came back later and said my manager would like to give you some complimentary desserts.... we just ate cake ... no thank you. Still no apology. Brought out the bill no apology and took off one little appetizer for the horrible service. Not to mention we had some other waitress who brought us food and was so snotty and rude about the slow service. Anyways ended the night and never once saw or heard from the manager. How the manager handles situations like these speaks volumes of the restaurant. Needless to say we won't be going back. Over priced Italian food with terrible service.",

Our first visit was a total joy and we'll be returning soon.   Started out with the Chef's board...a delightful assortment of cheese, meat, veggies, bread and more and a great way to begin the meal. The short rib radiatori deserves its highly reviewed reputation...really good, and the burrata tortellini is equally delicious.   Decor is modern and open but the large crowd made it a little on the loud side. Service was friendly and prompt considering that it was very busy.   Prices are fair considering the quality of the food and uniqueness of the menu.   As I've told a number of people...you gotta try this place.",

    "text": "This was my second time dining at North Italia.  The first time was the week they opened (Dec 2017) and the service was very slow, but my friend & I decided to give it a second chance in hopes that the slow service back then was due to how new they were.  Well, lets just say the service is still slow (entrees were served 1 hour after we were seated) and our server lacked basic customer service.    He was very friendly; however, I ordered the potato, sausage & kale soup as an appetizer (their featured item he told me about), but he brought me tomato soup. While he had the soup in front of me, he explains that the featured items he mentioned were incorrect.  I felt that I was not given a choice to decline the soup (I was really looking forward to the soup I ordered) as he had it in front of me while telling me what happened (keep in mind we were still charged for his mistake).  The food was okay.  Nothing to really rave about.  Usually, a spoon would be served with spaghetti and meatballs; however, we only had forks & knives.  When our server bought us the bill, he placed it right in front of me assuming that I was paying.  I know this review is mainly about an individual's customer service; however, this is when management needs to train better on proper dining etiquette when hiring young servers.  After giving them a second chance, unfortunately, we will not be returning based on the lack of training and low food quality.",

    "text": "The service staff seemed overwhelmed on a Wednesday evening, so I'd be hesitant to come back on a weekend night. I was with a party of 14 and the service was a little lacking, we really should have had two waiters instead of one. The food and drinks came at different rates making some of us  wonder if our orders were forgotten. I had to remind the server twice about my wine. I guess they don't do bread service? Strange for an Italian restaurant, especially a busy one, where people have a long wait even with reservations. Dessert wasn't offered or mentioned before the checks were arrived, perhaps they were in a hurry to turn the table. And one last thing, they pour wine from little wine carafes into your wine glass which is inefficient for their volume and yet they don't offer freshly grated Parmesan for your pasta at the table. If asked, they will drop off two plastic cups; one of granulated Parmesan and one of dried chili flakes like a common pizza joint. I'm not sure they have their priorities straight and it seems incongruous to their prices and semi high-end menu offerings. All of us at the table were a little surprised by that. But this is a chain restaurant so many things won't really be authentic anyway, I suppose.  Their star specialty, the bolognese pasta was very good. The fresh pasta makes a difference. Everything else I tasted was a little on the salty and oily side. Not sure I'll be back soon, maybe later when/if they've ironed out their service weaknesses.",

I was disappointed when the carafe came, but it tasted so amazing even without fresh fruit that I would say order it anyway if you are a sangria lover. We ordered a second carafe for good measure. Regarding the food: Our table ordered many different dishes family style: pasta bolognese, kale salad, Caesar salad, roasted cauliflower, truffle garlic bread... all phenomenal. Tiramisu has crunchy chocolate bits on top - a nice variation on the texture. Love this place. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "With 2 kids under 2, it is a rare event that my husband and I get to go on a date anymore, so when the grandparents offered to babysit so we could go on an early Valentines outing, I knew I wanted to pick somewhere special, without having to drive to the strip.  I could not believe how many reviews this place had after only being opened a short while, and all very good reviews!  Well let me tell you it was either the fact that a break form stay at home motherhood would have made a McDonalds date night a 5 star experience, or this place truly is amazing, and deserves all of these rave reviews! :-) It was quite busy for arriving at 4:30 and by the time we left at 6 there was already people waiting outside for a table. We started with the truffle garlic bread. I thought, how can garlic bread be any different than from any other italian place?, but oh it oh it can be! This was wonderful! For my main meal I had the short rib pasta which was pretty much perfection, and my husband had the pig pizza and the chicken parm. which he said he really liked. I tried the pasta that came with the chicken and it was great! For dessert we had the hazelnut tart. It was good, but the toffee pieces that came with it were heavenly... I would have preferred a bowl full of that! :-)  The only tiny negative was I had ordered a decaf coffee that I wanted with my dessert. Our dessert came and halfway through they asked if I still wanted it since they were making it fresh, and at that point I did not want it anymore. Really no big deal at all. The service was great, prices pretty decent, and you can tell the waiters really enjoy the food and sharing it with us. This will be our new date not spot (If we ever get to go on one again :-)) Definitely glad we tried it!",

    "text": "North has a lot going for it.  The food is fresh and interesting.  They are willing to customize ingredients and accommodate differing tastes.  We started with a Chef's Board which had a nice selection of nibbles.  The Calamari was tasty and crisp, but more of a beer batter than what you see in most Italian places.  The rice balls were crisp on the outside and pretty good inside, although they could of used a bit more flavor.  Pasta generally are decent sized and overall nice ingredients put together well.  Chick Parm was tender inside and crisp out.  It was served with a pasta with a white cheese sauce.  The cocktail list and wine list were more than adequate.  The problem is service.  Its just very raw.  Our bread came out without any plates.  We ordered drinks when we sat down.  They didn't come out till our starters were almost done, even though we ordered those well after the drinks. The staff was appologetic, but it still required us to raise this three times before they showed up. Our mains came out and even though we were at a table of four with room on each side the runner insisted on passing food over two of us instead of walking around the table.  Server, who was very nice, confused out credit card with another table so paying was delayed. Its not that I expect white glove service at a casual neighborhood place, but I do expect efficiency and basic understanding of things like how to serve food at the table.  I view this place as a strong four star place that get pulled down to 3/4 based on front of house.",

I was celebrating an advancement in my job field and chose this restaurant as the place to enjoy this exciting time and I feel it was a mistake. I asked for a soda before my meal came and they tried to bring it to me 30min later once I got dessert menus. I decided we didn't want dessert here and left. The food was OK and was enjoyable but everything else killed it for me. Even paying the bill once the check was brought took around 30+min. I really feel the problem was my party size again, as I looked around I noticed the owner or manager walking to every table that was 4+ in party size but not us. And they ensured the larger tables were accommodated which makes sense of course but return business is crucial, and I don't see myself returning at this point.",

Table was a little small though. With 4 people and multiple plates it was a balancing act to keep drinks from spilling off.  Agreed it was a little slow. The entire pace of the place was slow. Not painfully just moved at a slower pace. We were never neglected for attention though. So we were starving by the time our food came out (we were never offered bread for the table).

    "text": "This place is really good, authentic, and overall delicious. Make a reservation.  For appetizers, we started with a chef's board, which was REALLY good. There was actually a lot of food, and after asking for some extra bread, we cleaned it up (family of 5, 3 teenage boys). We got an arugula and fennel salad, which was very good and had a nice lemon flavor. We also ordered the crispy calamari, which was the BEST calamari I've ever tried. Absolutely fantastic. We added on some mushroom tortellini, which was good and tasted very fresh. Definitely 5-star appetizers.  For entree, we ordered 1 bolognese, a fungi pizza, shortrib, strozzapreti, and a squid ink pasta. The bolognese was good- traditional and hearty. The squid ink pasta was not too good. It was weirdly spicy (but not excessively so) but really did not have much flavor. Don't get it. The strozzapreti was AWESOME- so flavorful and delicious. The shortrib was excellent. It was deliciously soft and flavored well with red wine, and the polenta it came with was sooooo good. Also got a fungi pizza, which was a lot. 5-Star entrees if you know what to order- just avoid the squid ink. Entrees are good sized- not like most good restaurants. They give medium-large portions.  4 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts was a bit much, again for family of 5 which 3 teenage boys.   For dessert, we ordered a tiramisu, affogato, and bordini. The tiramisu was good, but the bordini was AMAZING. Absolutely FABULOUS. Among the best desserts I've had and will ever have- like a salted caramel milkshake that's super creamy in a single AMAZING bite that's just so elevated. The affogato was ok. Solely the bordini was so good it was worth it.  awesome 5-Star meal, definitely will come back for happy hour. Awesome service, expensive (but reasonably so) prices, good portions, 10 minutes wait time, and DELICIOUS meal.",

I've been to many restaurants on opening week/weekend and so much was lacking here and I was so excited to try this place.   We got there and had reservations and were seated immediately. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful so no complaints there. We ordered an appetizer that came out very quickly and tasted great (garlic should have been in much smaller pieces). It then took another 45 minutes to get our food. Our kids were unmanageable by the time our food got to the table and by that point it was hard to enjoy much.  We were brought bread about 30 minutes into the wait because the food was taking so much longer than anticipated. The food was mediocre. The potato and spinach daily special pizza was WAY too spicy and had barely any potatoes. The fig and goat cheese pizza with prosciutto was good, but way too many figs and not enough goat cheese, leaving the pizza just way too sweet. Super chewy and doughy spots on the pizzas, leaving other spots charred and too crispy to eat.   I can completely understand opening weekend can be rough, but we weren't even offered a gesture of kindness for having to sit and wait forever and it even took the same 45 minutes to bring the kid's food out. Just unacceptable to me for a restaurant that's not necessarily cheap. Most places would offer an appetizer comp or maybe a dessert comp even for the wait and frustration, but nothing.   I think we might go back and try it again, but it would have been nice to see management walking around to tables having to wait for extended amounts of time explaining the slow food situation etc. If we go again, it'll be sans kids just in case the wait is always this bad for food.  Long story not so short, the food is probably normally much better when things aren't so fast and furious in the kitchen and the waitress was very nice, but was just really hoping for a better experience.",

Both of these restaurants (which I think are owned by the same company) have great attention to detail to the service and the food entree's. I have been to both over 10 times, and the best part is their consistency to deliver! They have not let us down yet - I just hope they keep it up!   The ingredients are fresh, the portions are perfect, and the service is warm and not overbearing! Love it!",

Very crisp and slightly sweet served on a bed of arugula - interesting.  The pizzas and pastas are also spot on. Service is friendly and accommodating. The bar is relaxing and comfortable. Even the restrooms are attractive and super clean.  But if you are in a hurry, pick another place. The kitchen just can't seem to keep pace with the orders. The last time we were there, it took 15 minutes for the appetizer and 20 minutes after the appetizer was finished for our main course. If they can overcome that one problem, this would be a five star restaurant",

First of all I am stoked to see Flower Child is finally coming to Vegas in the same shopping center, but that's a review for another time! This area is undergoing a huge facelift, and North Italia is one of the new tenants. We were greeted with a warm welcome and the decor and atmosphere are very modern and relaxed. It feels super hipster but not pretentious. You can see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen through windows, and the kitchen is just as nice as the rest of the restaurant.  We started with the garlic truffle bread. It was heavenly! We ate about half of it (it was a generous portion) and I took the rest home to my husband, who devoured it. Mom got the chicken pesto and I got the spaghetti and meatballs. Mine was good. You can tell the noodles are fresh made. But that chicken pesto was out of this world! It is VERY green and looked a little off putting at first glance but it's tasty. There was a very generous amount of chicken-seriously it was a whole breast. The pine nuts and capers added a nice crunch. The service was good and we we'll definitely be back!",

I asked him this is it for $15 a bottle and you charge $21 a glass ? I get sarcasm and \"don't you know restaurants mark up bottles\" I  eat dinner out four days a week it's not my first time out . Well he charged me for the higher priced wine$21  and gave me $16 as I see on your menu now that I am home and still pissed off. It's only $10 but the attitude ruined my nice night out with friends.                            Management contacted me and sent a $25 gift card . I returned and had great service and a great Meal",

    "text": "Not coming back.  Food was 3 stars and there was no service.  We were greeted and seated immediately by the hostess.  At first glance, the decor was simple, open, and soft lighting seems inviting and welcoming, but it stops there.  Don't get me wrong, there are a ton of staff and no one was particularly idle.  The failure on the service comes from a lack of training and perhaps the way the teams were structured.  From the time we were sat with a menu, it took 11mins for the server to come by and identify himself, as he was already walking away with his head turned to say \"I'll be right with you okkkkaayyy?\"  Another 4 minutes go by, he comes back to ask us if we wanted to order drinks, still no water in hand or on the table.  We asked for water and was about to order when he turned to leave so we actually had to stop him from running away to get the orders in and to not course it.  Now there are tables being set all around us that are assigned to various servers and our server got additional table at this point.  Everyone else did not seem to have to wait long to be greeted, get drinks, or have their orders taken.  We know this because the table that got sat 20mins after us in his section got their drinks and food first.  Not only that, our server never brought us bread until when my entree arrived and my husband asked if we needed to place an order for a bread basket.  You read that right.  My lone plate of pasta arrived first, ahead of the complimentary bread and our other plates, which were the arancini and a pizza.  When one requests to not course a meal, it is assumed to be brought out together, not one at a time.  By the time my husband's pizza and arancini arrived, my pasta dish was lukewarm.  Our bread with the olive oil and vinegar arrived last.  Server dropped it off and ran off without giving us bread plates.  We had to flag down someone else to get it.  Our water were never refilled.  We were almost through the meal when the server came by to ask \"how are things going?\" rather than when the food was delivered to see if we required condiments or if the food were to our liking.  I guess it's impossible when plates were spaced so far apart so that it was like we were eating separate meals.  About the food and flavors: - Arancini was delicious and comes in 3's on a cast iron plate, except the dish was not even hot when we got it.  It was filled with once melted but now has resolidified cheese - special of the day eggplant pizza was overly salty and the skin of the eggplant made it so when you took a bite, the entire topping came off with it and was messy to eat by hand.  You should fork and knife every bite - Squid Ink mafaldine was tomato and basil forward with a lot of heat to the spice.  While it's a unique dish, it was not great tasting and the portion was small for $20. The sauce to pasta ratio was good, but the amount of seafood was meager.  The 4 small shrimps and squid strips were not cooked in the sauce so it came out very bland  While I was still eating, the server started cleaning up my plate while I was mid bite to ask if we wanted dessert.  My husband had to stop the server and ask him to put the plate down because I was still eating.  My meal would have been no different if we ordered at a self serving kiosk and got our own water, utensils, and napkin with a number on an extension stand.  It was a ridiculous experience and a waste of time and money!  For the many Italian and Italian American options available in Summerlin (e.g. Trattoria Reggiano, Honey Salt, Masso Osteria, Spedini), I'm going to tell everyone to pass on North Italia.",

Very good sauce and spicy, which I love, but the pasta was pretty under cooked and the fish portions were minimal at best. No bread. No amenities. I also had the soup. It was okay, a little salty but it has salami in it so somewhat expected. What was disappointing was the fairly heavy layer of oil or grease on top of the soup. So, ehh. Sorry!  I gave them the three stars largely due to the sauce but truly underwhelmed otherwise.",

It definitely has a more a contemporary feel but with home-y feeling. I was there for Sunday brunch so it was packed.   I ordered their breakfast wrap and my girls and I shared a pitcher of their red sangria. The breakfast wrap was so good! I literally inhaled it the moment I took my first bite of it. It had Italian sausage, mushrooms, smoked mozzarella, scrambled eggs, and roasted pepper. It came with this cream sauce on the side. I'm not entirely sure what it was but it complemented the wrap really well. It was so nicely made, it wasn't messy or greasy, and it was filling. The perfect amount of flavor and I was impressed that their was a good amount of sausage and mushrooms. Other breakfast wraps or burritos I've had in the past consisted mostly of scrambled eggs and not much of anything else. So this had a good ratio of everything. The sangria was nice and refreshing and between 4 girls, we were able to have 2 glasses each out of the pitcher. The pitcher is $28 which I feel is a deal instead of each girl getting bottomless mimosas.   The service was great and timely! Our service was very accommodating and sweet. I will definitely be back to try their other menu items!",

My husband and I came for dinner and sat at the bar last night, and after this experience, I don't know how this restaurant stays in business with horrible service. Our server was great and apologized, however, we waited over 1 hour for our food. The manager said it took this long because they were waiting for us to finish our first course (zucca chips and a small Caesar for my husband, I had nothing). This is not a first course, and I never have had this type of issue eating at fine dining restaurants. Admitting you put an H on my receipt because you were waiting for us to finish the \"first course\" and that the food never got put in is unacceptable. People make mistakes and I appreciate the server trying to make up for it and apologizing. But the manager, trying to justify that we were hungry, and then only comping the salad and zucca chips, that's a slap in the face. I didn't wait for the chips or the salad, I waited over an hour for a pizza and chicken parm. Bad management at its finest, especially when the server says, I wanted to comp your drink too, the chips and salad just isn't enough. That's not how you treat customers, let alone regulars.   Updated review on 6/10/19 - a huge thank you to the manager Cole who resolved our complaints, he is a wonderful manager and made our most recent North Italia dining experience very special. Thank you for everything, and we will be back.",

    "text": "Nice place. I've gone to the North Italia in Irvine, CA, and it's pretty much the same feel, ambiance, service, etc. The food is consistently good. There is outside dining for cooler days in Las Vegas. The pasta dishes are my favorite, but my companions really enjoyed their pizza selection as well. No complaints about our waitress, but we waited nearly 15 minutes for someone to 'clean up' and outdoor table for us to be seated, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. One of our party members followed up after a 10 minute wait and was told that there is only one hostess available to prep the table. It's a little concerning that during a slow part of a late lunch hour there is still such a delay in busing. But other than that, it was an enjoyable experience.",

Definitely make a reservation is your best bet, since they seem to be busy all the time. I went on a Monday night around 7pm and it was filled!   I went with my friend for her birthday and we started off with a glass of wine. I ordered the house Pinot Grigio, the 2nd one on the wine list- which was sweeter, they say. They brought out bread, which how could you say no?! I wish it was hot when they delivered it. But, the oil and vinegar just made it all better.   I then shared the Mediterranean mussels and margherita pizza, which was the perfect amount. The mussels were ok, it was definitely better towards the middle of the pot since the sauce was stirred and simmered on to the mussels. As for the margherita pizza, AMAZING! Perfect amount of cheese and a basil leaf to balance it out.   And last but not least, the salted caramel bundino for dessert, talk about never wanting it to end. It was soooo good!   Definitely must go back, would love to check out happy hour next time!",

The dinner was very good but it was our friend's birthday and it took 17 minutes to get the birthday girl her dessert even though we told the waitress from the outset.

Also it wasn't as creamy like many pastas, which was nice. This time, I had the funghi pizza as well as the bruschetta for happy hour. Prices are on the higher end but no regrets!

We where seated at a small table, for us, that's usually a bad choice because we tend to order a lot of food and a small table doesn't have enough room for all of our food! But, being Valentine's Day, they needed to maximize space! We understand!  We ordered the Tuscan kale salad-crispy pancetta, charred grape, apple, pistachio, breadcrumb, parmesan vinaigrette ale; the chef's board-prosciutto di parma, artisan cheese, marinated eggplant, roasted pepper, castelvetrano olive, marcona almond; and the arancini-crispy mushroom risotto stuffed with scamorza cheese & served with red sauce. All where excellent! Highly recommend all three!   For main entree, we had the chicken Parmesan- crushed tomato, aged provolone, mozzarella, parmesan rigatoni. Large portion, crispy breaded chicken, large portion of pasta! And the diver scallops-parmesan risotto, roasted butternut squash, brussels leaf, crispy shallot, pancetta. They where cooked perfectly!   To finish off a great meal and to celebrate Valentine's Day, we got almond & mascarpone tart- cranberry orange compote, basil, saba very creamy and we had specialty dessert, chocolate cream, hazelnut with toffee bits, caramel sauce. Both where so creamy good!  Good meal, excellent service, great ambiance, a recommended experience!",

The decor was modern yet inviting to for the dining patrons.    Since I was visiting with two foodies, we were able to experience a little bit of everything.  To start we shared the Arancini.  The three crispy fried balls consisted of mushroom risotto stuffed with scamorza cheese.  Outstanding.  The fresh red sauce is house made and definitely stands out.    For our entrees we shared the chicken parmesan, stozzapreti & Margherita pizza.  Again all of their sauces are house made.  It makes every dish uniquely fantastic.  The Margherita pizza was baked to perfection.  Their crust is also house made fresh.  The chicken parmesan is a very large portion.  The parmesan rigatoni accompanies the chicken for a great combination.  This gives you a little white sauce and red sauce on one plate.  I absolutely loved the Strozzapreti.  The twisted pasta is tossed in a delightful parmesan cream sauce and combined with chicken, roasted mushrooms, spinach and toasted pine nuts.  I could not get enough of this dish.   Even with all of that great food in my stomach, we powered through for some tasty treats.  We ordered the lemon donuts as well as the Almond & Mascarpone tart.  The 3 donuts were warm little bites of heaven.  The lemon sauce also has some dabs of vanilla. The tart was the absolute winner.  The unique dessert is plated with cranberry orange compote, basil and saba.  It's so creamy with the punch of the almond crust.    I would recommend North Italia every day of the week!",

For appetizers I have tried the white truffle garlic break which is super filling/heavy but super yummy nonetheless. If I'm not in the mood for something super heavy I get the calamari which is a must!!! I always get the chicken Parmesan for my entree, which also happens to be their house special, and I like how the pasta comes out al dente naturally. For drinks, I usually get the jumpstart which is a chocolate-y coffee drink. Service is always good! I would come here for a cute dinner with friends because of the casual yet tasteful atmosphere/decor or a date night.",

They have a nice covered outdoor patio with a full bar separating the inside seating. Modern and yet warm, there's ample seating and the menu has something for everyone.  Have eaten at the North Italia in Santa Monica and enjoying our lunch at that location, my daughter and I decided to give this location a try.  We were promptly seated and menus given. Our waitress came over and took drink orders and my daughter put in an order for bruschetta (they have two variations, she got the traditional one of tomato and basil). We then ordered,  I selected the chicken farm greens salad and my daughter chose the chicken parm.  My salad was fantastic (field greens, tomatoes, toasted pine nuts, grilled chicken, gorgonzola crumbles). My daughter liked the chicken parm, but the accompanying pasta was far too over salted and buttery. She ate two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  Service is wonderful, attentive and friendly. Decor is attractive and is good for all types of social engagements.",

It is ALWAYS busy. I hate lines or having to wait long so I never bothered to dine here until a few weeks ago. I decided to make reservations and just take a chance on not having to wait so long when arriving. I really think it was meant to be because we were seated immediately after checking in with the hostess and our orders were taken not too long after given the menu. Service here is quick and the food is good. We sat out in the patio and I was quite surprised that it felt much cooler outside than it did inside the restaurant. The misting system they have is great for the Vegas heat. I will rate the food & service here a total of 3.5 stars. I'm glad I got to try this place out. The location is convenient for me when I do my retail therapy next door and get hungry. I wouldnt mind dining here again if it isn't a long wait. But if not i'll just pass and come back another time.",

We got white truffle garlic bread, zucc chips, bolognese and chicken Parmesan. (Yes we were hungry lol)   We didn't even ask Gerardo to split our main meals and he did it automatically. It was great. He even had a little surprise for us at the end just from listening to what we were considering for dessert!   We already knew North Italia had delicious food but Gerardo elevated the whole experience even more! Thank you Gerardo!!",

They offer both indoor and outdoor seating. Due to the chilly weather, we chose to dine inside.  The decor is nice, and the staff were extremely friendly. My main issue was the size of our table. We were only a party of two, and we were seated along the left wall. The table was so tiny, and also I felt we were too close to the tables on either side of us. Next, since we were so close to our neighbors --- I found myself super conscious of what I was saying because I didn't want strangers hearing my entire conversation!   After getting over my small table and close seating arrangements, I took in the menu. They offer many items for a variety of tastes which was nice. I decided to go with a sandwich, while Suki ordered a hearty seafood pasta. Both of our orders were prepared brilliantly, and I definitely couldn't finish my meal due to the size of it.  Our waitress was extremely efficient and pleasant. I liked the fact that she had filled my drink before I even asked for another one!  Overall, I liked North Italia and I would return. However, next time I would request to sit either at a larger table or in area with a bit more personal space. Solid lunch though!",

I've sat inside each time and recommend making a reservation because they are always busy!  We always start with the Chef Board.  I have an eggplant allergy and they always accommodate me and change the board to ensure no eggplant.    I've tried the Squid Ink Pasta but be warned it has a kick to it.  Definitely worth it if you can handle the spice.  I've had the Bolognese which was good but my favorite is their pasta with Chicken and veggies with a white sauce!  I love that all of their pasta is made in house.  We usually get the garlic bread with our meal which is SO DELISH!  For dessert they have the Affogato!  YUMMMM!!!  Who doesn't love Espresso and Ice Cream!  Their most popular dessert is probably the Salted Caramel Bambino!  It's very heavy but nice to try a few bites!  Their Lemoncello is the perfect way to end your experience!  As long as you're willing to spend the money, they have everything you could need to make the perfect meal.",

I like that the chef's board is more than just cheese...all kinds of goodies. I also love their salads...I've had them several times and they're always good.   The cocktail menu is great and the sangria is always yummy.   Now for today... First time I've come here for brunch. I ordered breakfast and my friend ordered a pizza. My food was ok. I was starving so I ate it. That said, it was super greasy...like dripping. The potatoes are also not breakfast potatoes. They're more like fried blobs of mashed potatoes without a lot of flavor.   My friend said her pizza wasn't good - the sauce tasted canned and the cheese was gloopy.  The waiter took her pizza off the bill because she barely ate any of it.   Anyways, I'll probably come back because I've had good experiences here before, but brunch was a let down.",

I haven't had one thing there that I haven't liked between the chef's board, zucca chips (that melt in your mouth), heirloom tomato and burrata (must for an appetizer), the pig pizza, short rib radiatori, and the bolognese (house specialty). They use such fresh ingredients and the pasta is made from scratch. The only downside is that we usually experience slow service.",

    "text": "It was tempting to just stay in Henderson and not drive 45 minutes across town on a Friday evening. BUT, we had to try this place and I'll never pass up a good Italian restaurant.   I'm so glad we made the journey! There's a nice toasty fireplace out front and outdoor seating with heaters. We opted to sit indoors as much as I would have enjoyed the heat. It's very open and spacious inside and the kitchen can be seen through a huge glass window.   There was so many good things to choose from in the menu but we ended up ordering the meatballs, white truffle garlic bread, arancini, and a margherita pizza. Also, a kids cheese pizza for the kiddo. The initial wait was a little long but I was starving so it could have just been me. All the small plates came out first. I thoroughly enjoyed it all. I had never had arancini before but you can bet it's my new favorite. The sauce on that and the meatballs was so amazing. We were using the bread to scoop up ever last bit of it. The pizza was perfect as well and very seasoned. The crust was just right.   For dessert we had the chocolate hazelnut torta and a scoop of chocolate and hazelnut gelato. It really liked the torta but the gelato wasn't as sweet as I'm used to. Still good, nonetheless!   The bathroom handles are labeled hot and cold which made my daughter happy, the small things in life.   I will for sure venture to dine here again. But the need one in Henderson!",

The arugula and calamari blended flavor with a little bit of lemon juice gives it a nice sweet, sour, deep fried aroma.  Then the fish and our pasta short ribs followed.  The fish skin was crispy.  And the ribs was tender, and flavorful.   The pasta was also cooked perfectly.    Really nothing to complain about.  I did order the salted caramel dessert which was really too salty for me so I'd pass on that but my wife liked it.",

I do like our dessert choice Tiramisu - perfect texture and just the right amount of flavors. Next time we'll come back to try dinner menu. Eyeing on the risotto and perhaps different dessert choice!

We started off with meatballs and calamari and I finished with a bolognese, my wife had the Strozzapreti. Let me tell you all the dishes were excellent, some of the best we've had in our 45 years of dining- and we have been to Italy! Our waitress Gosia was delightful very knowledgeable about wine and extremely helpful. I highly recommend going to North Italia!!!",

From start to finish, every single bite was excellent. Squid ink pasta, \"The Pig\" pizza, short rib pasta, and the salmon were our choices. Short rib pasta with the white cream sauce was particularly good. Couldn't get enough!  After the main course, we had the tiramisu and hazelnut torta, paired with a \"Jump Start\" coffee. Again, Gerardo's recommendations were top notch!  Ambience is great. Love the decor - transitional modern with rustic, yet elegant, features consistently throughout. Service was exceptional as well.  Definitely coming back!!",

It's located in the little shopping area off the corner of Rampart and Charleston. You'll see a Pottery Barn and Honey Salt. The exterior of this place is super cute - Instagram worthy, if you ask me. They have an outdoor patio with a huge fireplace. I'm sure it looks gorgeous at night.   My friend and I went early on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty packed, but we were seated right away. We had requested to sit outdoors and I'm glad we did. It was slightly windy, but it didn't take away from the experience. Our sever (I wish I remembered her name) was the sweetest. She gave us a rundown of the menu and even recommended her favorite items. One of options we chose was the Chef's Board. The part that stuck out the most was when the cheese was being described. The male server who gave it to us described it as \"The rebellious cousin of Parmesan cheese.\"  All in all, this place was amazing. My friend and I have already planned to return and order strictly pizza this time.",

We both work in the restaurant industry and have patience and understanding when it comes to restaurants being busy during lunch hours.

The meatballs were delicious too! The sauce was perfect!   I loved the salad I had which was the farm salad and had Italian lunch meats and was perfectly dressed.  The colleagues I was doing with both got the chicken Parm and they loved it. The pasta it came with had some type of truffle oil and smelled delicious.   The service was fantastic also!",

So my recommendation would be to go at lunchtime when it's not so crazy!!!",

Not the case with this restaurant at all. 5 stars for being unique across the board. Can't wait to go back. The first time we had a server that was awesome but I can't remember his name! Brought my wife back a second time and we had Emily. Outstanding service. Attentive, kind, upbeat. This staff makes sure you have a great time. Bravo",

    "text": "Nice restaurant with a cool patio and fireplace, and reasonably good service. They didn't bring out any bread with our drinks which we thought was weird.  The chicken parm was good, crispy, and comes with rigatoni alfredo. The spaghetti with meatballs was also very good, nice thick pasta, good meatballs,  probably could have used a little more sauce. The players could have come out with higher temperature,  they were not really hot.   The kids cheese pizza was great but you're going to pay $10 and higher for kids meals with drinks FYI. I would give them 3.5 star rating if it was possible on Yelp , but not a 4.0 since they didn't offer bread and bc they charge full price $3.50 for a kids drink. It was pretty good but not amazing. For comparison, Carrabba's has great beer prices on happy hour, low price kids meals, and their soups are amazing, easy to rate them higher from a family perspective.",

We were roasting at our table in the middle of the patio.   Our server was pleasant and helpful. We chose a modified gluten free veggie appetizer which came pretty quickly. Our pizza took another 40 minutes- they did alert us about a delay but it had already been over 30 minutes.   At this point I was not feeling well so we left pretty quickly. Needless to say I was glutened - so if you too have celiac please reconsider eating here.",

We got a bottle of prosecco for $18!! What a deal. This will be my new fav Sunday dinner place. We started with their signature truffle ricotta bread which was delicious, however a bit pricy for $11.  They even have a kids menu with all of the kids favorites. My kids tried the Alfredo pasta with grilled chicken which was delicious. My husband tried the strozzapreti, interesting name, our server told us that means \"strangle the priest\"  It was pasta with Parmesan cream sauce, chicken, pine nuts and mushrooms. He loved it. I tried the burrata tortellini served in a light mushroom sauce. I thought it was just ok. I don't think I want to repeat that.  For dessert we had their tiramisu which was absolutely delicious. Loved the little chocolate balls on top, added a nice crunch.  One thing I didn't like was that there is no bread on the house, you don't expect that from an Italian restaurant. The only bread option is the $11 truffle bread.   Updated : Gave a second try... 5 Star all the way!! All credit goes to our fantastic server Cynthia. Took care of every single detail throughout our dinner. Was so kind to my kids. Food was fantastic, tried Aranchini this time, perfectly crisp on the outside, soft gooey mushroom risotto on the inside, red sauce complemented the dish very well. Also, they serve bread now!! That was my disappointment at first visit, so happy to see fresh bread and butter.",

One of my favorite things is the inside/outside concept that allows you to feel the fresh air while sitting inside on hotter temp nights. Last week we both tried new cocktails including the Ginger Blossom Margarita and Apricot Limonata, they did not disappoint!  My Favorites from the menu are: Spaghetti and meatballs  Truffle Garlic Bread \"The Pig\" Pizza (with extra spicy sauce!)  Already looking forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "I'm only giving a two-star because I've eaten here before and for the most part, this restaurant used to been consistent. Not that the food is anything to write home about but, for the most part, the atmosphere is wonderful and the outdoor patio is very comfortable (until today). I took a friend to eat here. She just moved back to Vegas and wanted me to suggest good places for lunch. We sat down on the patio and waited quite a while before anyone approached us. It's wasn't that busy at the time. Our waiter was pleasant enough and we ordered the Heirloom Tomato & Burrata, the Grilled Artichoke and the Crispy Calamari. The Tomato and Burrata was delicious. We each took a bite of the calamari and both looked at each other and kinda wanted to spit it out. It was fishy, cold, oily and way too much breading on it. Not good. We wanted to tell the waiter about it, but never saw him again until toward the end of our meal. Then we tried the grilled artichoke. It was not cooked enough, full of oil and very hard to eat. We ended up picking the leaves off and just ate the heart.   In the mean time, a bee came flying by the table and my friend, who is deathly allergic to bees, got a bit panicky because she didn't have her epipen with her. As both of us watched where this bee was heading, it landed in our tomato & burrata and got stuck in the burrata. I put my napkin over the plate and tried to call someone to remove the plate. About 10 minutes later we finally saw a busboy and asked him to remove the plate as there was a bee underneath the napkin (still alive). We told him that we didn't get to finish this dish and would he please find our waiter. He walked away with the plate and stopped by the bar about 10 ft. from us and took off the napkin and let the poor bee live. However, this bee decided that he wasn't finished with us and flew back and landed on the table, where I was brave enough to smash my napkin on it. We still haven't seen our waiter and at this point we were just ready to get the heck out of there.   Finally, the waiter came to our table and asked how was everything. He was obviously clueless as we didn't even touch our calamari and the artichokes were a huge pile of uneaten leaves sitting on our 4\" plates, we both just looked at each other, shook our heads and asked for the check. I didn't want to make a scene as that is not my style. I probably should have, but actually, that moment when we got our check, another bee buzzed around us.   Sorry North Italia, I will never be going back to your restaurant. Also, might I suggest that you remove all the foliage in the patio area that attracts bees. It's very sad when a half decent restaurant just gets bad. I hope for your sake that your managers read these reviews and actually do something about it.",

The outdoor area had mist fan and shades which made it more comfortable on the hot days.  We went on a super hot day and decided to sit indoor.  Very welcoming and laid back ambiance dining area.    Food: We had zucca chips, white truffle garlic bread, black Mediterranean mussels, Italian meatballs and squid ink mafaldine.    Zucca chips was a little bit on the oily side, but the seasoning was on point, and my toddler and I could not stop eating them.    The white truffle garlic bread was served in a cast iron pan, toasted with a generous amount of butter , shaved mozzarella cheese and homemade ricotta.  It was more on the rich and heavy side.  I was amazed how they turned toasts into a dish.     Italian meatballs was yummy and had all the traditional flavors, 3 huge meatballs laid on top of a bed of creamy polenta.  Squid ink mafaldine had it's unique flavor, probably from the fennal and calabrian chili.    Our least favorite dish was the mussels, they were very small and skinny, and half of them the shells were not opened.    Service: Leonard was our server.  He was extremely helpful.  Ask for him!   Definitely going back and I cant wait to take my friends there next time.  I heard they have good happy hours too I cant wait to try it!",

    "text": "Went to my first choice always to find a good Italian restaurant near my hotel. Yelpers got it right once again! I ordered what many Yelpers liked- the strozzapretti. I thought the translation of \" strangle the priest\" an odd name for a dish and I still don't get it?! But it was delicious with a light cream sauce, a bit of spinach and hearty sliced mushrooms and chicken. If you like Alfredo, this is superior to this and you will like this. My 14 yo son loved it!   Both of these pasta dishes came out in heaping bowls which I liked. We had enough to take back to the hotel for another meal even so a good amount.  The Bolognese is their specialty dish. With hearty tagatelle noodles and lots of Parmesan cheese mixed in I believe, which made it too salty. I think leaving the cheese out and grate it freshly over this dish to your preference would have been better and would not have made it so salty. My son thought this dish was salty as well.  The appetizer of crispy calamari was a different kind and not very crispy but more breaded very lightly and then grilled with a light lemony vinaigrette. This was different than your normal expected fried calamari but it was very good in its own right and served over a platter of arugula which is an acquired taste for some, but I love arugula so good for me! My son loved this dish as well. They don't have a side dipping sauce with this, but you can ask for a marinara sauce on the side if you want.   Oh, we soooo wanted to try the desserts that Yelpers recommended, but we were just too full! Darn!  From the charming entrance of a patio cafe setting, with misting sprays which felt so good during the 106 degree heat, with a fireplace outside and a beautiful ocean and dock mural- aesthetics hits all the bells and whistles! Loved that you can see the kitchen with the saying on the wall( look at my pictures), the wooden slat ceilings, big balls of gold lighting- just a fresh, modern, chic and hip place to meet with friends.  Then the staff...from the host who was just as stylish and very nice to our waiter Carl who was extremely busy but always found time to check if we were doing okay! He was awesome and all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. We appreciated them even more, knowing they were so busy. Thank you! Loved the VIBE of this place!",

The server seemed nice enough to me just not trained at all as it took 10-15 for water.  We ordered the burrata, artichokes which we not cooked enough at all and over oiled. The presentation was nice the food was not edible. We also ordered the calamari which was oily and super breaded (adding arugula doesn't disguise low quality)The burrata looked really nice but unfortunately we got dive bombed by a bee. We hadn't even gotten to really eat our plate because of the bees.  Our server took our bee plate away and never even asked if he could make us a new one. We left hungry and thirsty. Worst meal I've ever had in Vegas.",

    "text": "Nice neighborhood restaurant ... food was good but did not blow me away like I was hoping and expecting. A group of 4 ladies and we like to sample each other's choices. Apps: calamari, strangely unique with a thicker than usual coating which was good if you ate it immediately. Arancini, eh it was just ok but would not order again. Zucca chips ... very good selection but sliced a bit too thin to eat gracefully. Bread with olive oil ... $8 ?? Hmmmm was expecting more for 4 slices of bread.   Drinks were kinda overpriced. This is not the strip so stop charging strip prices. Glass of wine with an 8 ounce pour was reasonably priced at $18.   Moving onto the entrees. I chose a simple meatballs and spaghetti option. Pasta was good, meatballs were just good and the sauce was just good .. nothing about this dish was mind blowing. Was hoping it was a wow but it wasn't. One friend had the scallops with risotto and another chicken Parmesan.   Dessert was the best course ... with a scoop of lemon sorbet leading the pack. Tiramisu was very good as well as the Italian donuts. I had a latte and my friend had a cappuccino...both were served lukewarm.   All dishes were good but not one of us had the omg wow factor we were hoping for. Will I be back ?? Hmmm .. the jury is out.",

    "text": "Food was okay, service was okay, whole experience here was just okay for me.   I came here with my 2 cousins for my birthday dinner and the food was pretty pricey for what it is and how it tastes in my opinion. We ordered the arancini ($11), bolognese ($20), braised short rib ($31), and margherita pizza ($18).   Arancini - the middle was kind of cold when I broke into it and ate it (and we ate it right when it came to the table too)... the flavor was alright and the texture was alright as well. The tomato sauce that was under the arancini wasn't anything to write home about.   Bolognese - tasted like chef boyardee ravioli, but the pasta noodles itself were really good and had a nice bite to it.   Braised short rib - for the price and portion of this short rib, I expected it to melt in my mouth. Unfortunately, it was a dry and was pretty mediocre compared to all of the other braised short ribs I've had. The polenta under it was delicious though.   Margherita pizza - the mozzarella was rubbery, marinara didn't have much taste to it, and the bottom of the pizza was BURNT. Extremely disappointed in this margherita pizza as it is so simple, yet they ruined it.   I got to choose a dessert for my birthday on the house, which was very nice of them. I got the hazelnut torta, and although decent, I definitely would not have paid $ for it.   ALSO, when we left there was a HUGE cockroach coming out from behind our booth. Which was disgusting, but I definitely understood because it was hot out and the waitress told us pest control comes every 3 months. BUT, STILL WOW GLAD WE SAW THE COCKROACH AFTER WE LEFT",

    "text": "This was a first for me at the North Italia and it was a great experience. A little more attention to a couple small details and it would've been perfect.   The night started with our good friends booking through Opentable. We walked in about 15 min early and were seated right away on a busy Friday night. It was a little unfortunate but the candle on our table was not lit (small detail) nor did it ever get lit the rest of the meal. Not a big deal but literally everyone else's was lit. We were promptly greeted with the menus and drink orders were taken. The waitress did not tell us about the soup of the day, the pizza of the day or any specials. Fortunately I saw it written on the board on the way in and nobody else seemed interested anyway.   Drinks showed up promptly and shortly after the appetizers came in. The appetizers we got for the table included the calamari - perfectly battered and fried - the batter had a tiny bit of sweetness which was quite nice, the grilled cauliflower - topped with a nice runny egg was also quite nice, and also the white truffle garlic bread - amazing. We are off to a good start!  The main courses seemed to take a little long to come out and the waitress was nowhere to be found, nor did she ever come and give us any update. When the main courses finally did come out - they did not come out at the same time, which was very unfortunate. Our friend's steak was getting cold while the rest of us were waiting.   Diver scallops were seasoned perfectly and had a beautiful sear. The short rib radiatori was very tender and flavorful and while the pasta was also beautifully cooked, the portion size seemed a little bit small for the price.   After we finished the entrees, dessert menus were handed out - unfortunately the waitress did not take the time to explain or recommend anything so I found myself googling on my phone what a budino and a torta was. The desserts we ordered were all visually appealing and quite rich/sweet - I'd suggest getting a black coffee to go with the tiramisu or the budino if you get any of those.  All in all a wonderful meal in a great atmosphere but a little more care and attention to detail from the waitress would've just made it perfect. For an upscale casual dining atmosphere I would definitely come back - but I'd probably do a little more of my own research on what to order before I come.",

Friendly, professional and efficient.  We each had the soup of the day which was tomato bisque, it was delicious, so creamy and good, with croutons and cheese, fabulous.  I had my favorite Burrata salad, which is toasted bread, lots of Burrata, and a variety of heirloom tomatoes and arugula, I love it. My friend had the Italian Grinder sandwich, with a side salad, she loved them both. We were stuffed, no room for dessert. Start to finish, everything was wonderful.  Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Some friends were in town from Calgary and we decided to try North Italia for something new.  I made a reservation and we were seated at the time reserved.  Since it was a pleasant early evening, we opted for the patio which made for a great dining experience--and the heaters were on.  First, we ordered their Chef's Board--happy hour priced at $10.  The menu says it's \"meat, cheese & some other goodies.\"  I forgot to take a photo of the board we dived in so quickly.  The prosciutto was good, there was enough cheese to each have some, and the almonds were a nice addition.  It was a very good starter.  We thought we were ordering the regular Chef's board--we didn't look at the Happy Hour menu.  I wonder if there would have been more prosciutto with the regular menu our server automatically got us the Happy Hour board although we were ordering from the main menu.  After that start, we looked at the menus we had kept for round 2.  We ordered their pizza they call The Pig.  Toppings are spicy pepperoni, soppressata, and Italian sausage.  This gave us time to space out our meal and spend more time catching up on news.  It was 6 months since I last saw them.  The pig is good.  The crust was thin and the pizza was the bendable kind.   Fold it in half to eat rather than losing toppings sliding off.  We didn't get dessert.  I reapply would recommend the patio.  It was so pleasant!",

My friend also ordered the pizza and didn't like hers either. We ended up just eating a bunch of bread and olive oil. The bread was good. I can say that. I also tried one of the soups. It was $8 for a small bowl and wasn't very good. It should have cost about $4 I think for the amount I got.

The host was wonderful and even when we requested specific seating after he had given us a 30-40 minute wait, he got us those seats in less than 10 minutes. Another server was super sweet and trying to help us out as well!  Food was delicious! We started with the meatballs, then shared family style the arancini, prosciutto bruschetta, and the strozzapreti (?).   My only negative would be that service was a little slow. With that being said, a manager was great for coming around with refills, answering questions, and helping his staff. I am in the industry and understand how tough it can be when it's a crazy busy night, especially on a day that isn't usually very busy. I have to praise for the teamwork, food, and how friendly the staff was. We can't wait to go back and try all the things!",

It took an inordinate amount of time to arrive at our table (20+ minutes). We were not even halfway through our appetizer when our entrees were unceremoniously slapped down on our table. We were not even asked if there was anything we needed. The server that delivered the food disappeared as quickly as she appeared. The Bolognese was very dry with little to no meat. In hindsight I should have sent it back. Once our entrees were served our server was like a ghost until it was time to pay. I felt like I was putting the server out when I asked her for some Parmesan cheese for our pastas. When the cheese was delivered we were only given enough cheese for one serving of pasta so we asked for Parmesan cheese for the the other bowl of pasta. I won't be returning. For $115 dinner I felt like the service was definitely lacking and the food was subpar. Wolfgang Puck at Downtown Summerlin is far superior with much better service, a nicer atmosphere and excellent food. Super disappointed, maybe I just went on an off night?",

The truffle bread was very cheesy and decadent, without overdoing it on the truffles, which some restaurants seem to have a hard time with. My entree was the squid ink pasta, which I got because I wanted to see what squid ink tasted like. It, surprisingly, had earthy notes instead of a sea flavor. There was also squid in the pasta, gave it a good combination of flavors. Make sure to get dessert, as the donuts are light and delicious.",

We arrived at 5pm and the outdoor space was well occupied so we opted for the bar inside since we only wanted a drink. We were seated and presented with menus by the bartender. That was the last we saw of her. Another bartender arrived to work as another closed out at the register and left. The new arrival served guests  who arrived after we did, but after some time it became apparent that we had been overlooked. We left, unnoticed. We are 70 something ladies and it would be easy to plead age discrimination. But I don't think that's what happened here. Better training and communication for staff is what is needed at this establishment.",

Our server was Bonnie and she legitimately was the nicest and most attentive server we've ever had at any restaurant. My girlfriend and I had the Italian grinder and the meatball sandwich, respectively, and both were amazing. All the food was very fresh and it showed. We will definitely be back here again and I'd recommend anyone thinking of coming to do so.",

To be honest mainly thanks to Nick, our waiter, he made sure we were taken very good care of, he was very attentive and made amazing suggestions. He was very professional yet funny and easy going. The food was beyond amazing, everything we tried exceeded our expectations. He helped us with wine recommendations as well and of course loved that!  Price wise, I feel it was very reasonable . I highly recommend this place and can't wait to be back there again soon.",

The parmesan pasta side with the chicken was not an afterthought, but very tasty. I look forward to going back again for dinner.",

I'm so glad I actually tried this place because everything I got was incredibly tasty. From the margarita pizza to the tortellini, I also ordered the arugula & roasted fennel salad and the heirloom tomato and burrata which were both so light yet so pleasing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a new Italian restaurant, you won't be disappointed as far as how the food tastes!",

Came here with my husband for Sunday brunch, I was not feeling to good as I was recovering from a massive hangover so I needed food ASAP.  As appetizers we ordered the seasonal soup which had potato, sausage and kale soup and we also ordered the prosciutto bruschetta.  The soup was so good and comforting and the bruschetta was on point too.  For my entree I decided to order the Bolognese and my husband had the Squid Ink Mafaldine.  My bolognese very good and the pasta was cooked perfectly (BTW this pasta cured my hangover).  My husband's pasta was really good too, the flavors were really unique and tasty.  For dessert we had the hazelnut torta, very good as well.  Can't wait to go back and try some pizza and other pasta dishes.",

My dining companion ordered the Caesar salad while I had the onion soup.  Both were exceptional. Strozzapreti was the special that my friend ordered.  He loved the meal so much that he decided he was going to make it upon his return to Boise.  I took him to a Cost Plus World Market to make sure that he returned home with the correct pasta. I ordered the chicken rosemary.  Everything was fresh, well-seasoned, served at the right temperature, and prompt.  The restaurant was pretty well-packed and there were many patrons who had opted to dine al fresco. Our waiter was familiar with the dishes, how they were prepared, and what most people enjoyed.  He was engaging and present when his services was requested. While it is not on the Strip or anywhere near downtown Las Vegas, I would strongly recommend this restaurant as a good value for your dollar as well as an excellent source of genuine Northern Italian fare.",

We were seated as soon as we arrived my wife had a view of the restaurant and I was able to observe the kitchen staff prepare our meal.    Joe was our waiter and he was most helpful with suggestions on what to eat, we shared a caesar salad, my wife ordered the mushroom pizza with smoked mozzarella and I ordered the pig pizza.  The food came all at once and it was outstanding.  We even tried one of the desserts a bombolini which was one of the best things I have ever tasted.

The best recipes I swear! Every single pasta I've had is just mind blowing how great and packed of wonderful flavors put into one plate are. Never ever disappoints at all . It's always packed full and very busy but the wait is so worth it. It's not just because it's new that I love it , its really mainly how freshly things are made here you can tell just in the taste. The place inside is just decorated beautifully and the tables are not crammed by one another. Great staff everyone's very nice and friendly from the second you step in and just full of smiles. Thank you for the great food north!",

Great food.. pasta freshly made. You can see behind the counter how it's  made. squind ink malfadine was too die for.. . Strozzapetti was delish too.  For app we had arancini and calamari.  Different take on calamari seems like it has balsamic reduction but it was lemon vinaigrette  which is good. Arancini .. gotta say had better.. lack mozzarella.. one I'm  used to My friends had pizzas.. they were good too..burrata appetizer was awesome!  For dessert.. the tart and hazelnut torta are my fave.  Tiramisu is different  but good. Bombolini with lemon sauce.. i dont care for..but that's  just me .. too tart... will come back and try their other dishes",

I knew they didn't offer happy hour on Friday's but loved the food before so thought it was still a good choice for Fri afternoon.  The atmosphere is great!  The bar area is fun and inviting- not all crammed in like some places.   Our server Rita was amazing!  Always there at the perfect time.  I ordered a bottle of an Oregon Pinot that sounded interesting and it was amazing!  Rita was very knowledgeable about the wine and told us to save some for desert because she knew the perfect pairing.   she did not disappoint and brought us a delectable piece of mascarpone cheesecake on the house!  What a treat and perfect with the Ribbon Ridge Oregon Pinot!! We were not disappointed with our appetizers.  Grilled artichokes are stupendous although I think they could put a little more effort into the dipping sauce.  Plain mayo?  How about some aioli please!  We also had meatballs that were absolutely delicious and if your a bread lover you must have the Truffle bread it's sinfully scrumptious!!    I'm holding back on the fifth star due to the size of the cocktail glasses.  2 friends joined us and had cocktails served in oversize shot glasses.  Really??  Come on North Italia!!  The prices warrant a real glass please!!  Overall a lovely place; thank you Rita for your excellent service!!",

But honestly four hostesses at the front of the house and a manager(?) having to identify a guest as either a reservation or walk-in put me off from the start....so the walk-ins must be placed in a different area (?) then being placed between a husband and wife couple who had two unattended children legitimately jumping and screaming for the first half of my meal and a party of 4.5 if you include the baby carrier that was placed in the seat where I had been sitting ...before getting up to go to the bathroom..it is those little lapses that cause me to choose somewhere else. Be consistent and respectful of all of your guests.   I would give them 4.5 stars for the food and the energy of the venue. The presentation is solid, the food is good and the service is attentive.   I am sure I will return.",

On my first visit the food was good but the service was slow and disorganized.  Last night our meal was great and our server, Jenn was outstanding. She totally redeemed this restaurant for me. Without having to ask she brought us samples of wine, made sure our water glasses were full and took time to describe menu items to a tee. She also told us about what sounds like an amazing brunch and weekday happy hours. Before leaving, she brought us a brunch menu and info on happy hour to take with us. We had a wonderful dining experience because of her friendly attentiveness. Try the calamari appetizer and the house made pasta dishes. The gelato was great!",

We had the garlic truffle bread (delish!) to start and had ordered the chicken Parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs but when they brought our dishes out it was the Bolognese instead of spaghetti and meatballs so we sent it back to get the correct food but after about 10 or 15 minutes we realized maybe they had forgotten about the spaghetti and meatballs so we just told them don't worry about and cancelled it since we ended up being really full from the truffle bread and chicken parm(which was also SO GOOD) . We are easy going people so we didn't throw a fit(what's the point, life is too short and you can't trust people who yell at waiters anyway) the manager was wonderful and gave us a dessert on the house, which after learning the salted caramel one wasn't available(lol of course) he told us to try the hazelnut dessert which was heavenly.   The inside is really pretty and modern. The floors are slippery so be careful if you're trying to wear cute heals ya may fall.   Go eat here it's delicious!",

I had family in town and we decided to dine \"family style\" to get more flavors on the table as recommended by our friendly and informative server,  Giana. She gave us an awesome tour of the menu and we proceeded with her recommendations. Arugula salad, cauliflower, chefs meats and cheese, and all beef meatballs- so good! We decided to share a few pitchers of delicious sangria ! For the main course we had seafood pasta-spicy, bolonesse-meaty, branzino-light and flakey, and short rib- tender! I must say all equally delicious. Perfect amount for our fam. We couldn't resist dessert. We said send out the best 3! Donuts, tart, & hazelnut cake. We were curious about Italian after dinner drinks and she sent 2 out, hard to pronounce never mind spelling but, what an experience! All staff was personable, even the manager stopped by our table!

    "text": "Went here for lunch. Sat at the outdoor portion of the bar. I ordered the rosemary and lime cocktail, the Bella Fiore cocktail and the squid ink pasta. The drinks were crafted perfectly. Great balance, great flavors. There was some kind of delay with my pasta, but both the bartender and the manager apologized to me multiple times. I wasn't in any kind of rush, so it was no bother to me. I took a star off for the pricing - kind of expensive for lunch, though they only have a dinner menu. Definitely will come back, and bring friends and family. Love the environment and the greatly crafted food",

It come with 6 meatballs and two garlic breads.  Very fresh and homemade.  For or entree I had roasted chicken with veggies. It was cooked to perfection. Super juicy and not dry at all.  My girlfriend had the roasted salmon which it had a base of white beans very different and unique that I never tried before. It pair extremely well with the salmon.  We hate it that we didn't have room for dessert or fr she pasta that they made in house. So I'm dying to go back to try more dishes.",

I don't know what heavens opened up to send this sweet angel down to the group I was with, but thank you. Gosia not only struts her way around the place like a graceful presence wearing a smile and greeting everyone she comes in contact with, but her honest recommendations about the food and drinks created one of the best meals I've ever had. Gosia seemed genuinely happy to be there serving us. She didn't rush the big group with their orders and questions. If I could clone a Gosia to bring with me to other restaurants, I would gladly do so. Gosia, wherever you are, thank you and can we be friends?",

Warm, casual vibe ... huge alfresco deck... inside/outside bar area... display kitchen in the back... great overall dining room that simmers with energy.   The food was really good!  The fried calamari was excellent. The batter is a lighter tempura type and not deeply breaded... delicious. Had the short rib with pasta in a parmesan cream sauce... a bit rich and indulgent... but very good.  Almond mascarpone tart for desert was the perfect burst of freshness after the richness of the pasta.   Servers and hosts were friendly and helpful... couldn't be happier.    Can't wait for warmer weather to enjoy the alfresco dining!  Best west side dinner in a long while.",

    "text": "Soooo glad I decided to try this place out! My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed our entire experience here with the decor, ambiance, food & service.   We ordered a little bit of everything, since it was our first time here. For drinks we got the margarita & sangria. Both had blood orange in them and were delicious. For appetizers we got the calamari & white truffle garlic bread. The calamari was good. I really enjoyed the arugula and lemon with it. The bread with the truffle butter was absolutely incredible. Probably my favorite item there.   For our entrees we ordered The Pig pizza, which had a great airy crust and the spicy pepperoni had the perfect amount of heat & flavor. For a thin crust pizza is was fantastic because the crust never got soggy, like most. We also had the burrata tortelloni, which was really good. I loved the creaminess of the filling. I just wish there was a thicker sauce with it. The sauce was watery, so it was hard to have it with the pasta. It was more like a soup afterwards. Lastly for entrees, we got the chicken Parmesan and it did not disappoint. It was thin and crispy, without being greasy or dry. The pasta with it was fresh and light.   Next up was dessert. We ordered the affogato, which was my favorite. The espresso was smooth and the vanilla ice cream was the perfect amount of sweetness to it. On top of the ice cream were crunchy pieces of what seemed like crushed up chocolate espresso beans. Whatever they were, it was an amazing taste & texture to the affogato. Last for the night were the little donuts with this lemon custard sauce on bottom. I want to say they were called bombinos or bombilinis...something along those lines. They were warm, doughy & delicious. I could eat the lemon custard all by itself. It was amazing!   The thing I loved most was the service here! Our server was Jazmine and she was lovely. Super friendly. She recommended items and gave her honest opinion when we asked about certain options. She checked up on us consistently without being on top of us during our dining experience. Due to the incredible food and even more incredible service from Jazmine, my husband & I will definitely be back and we've already told friends they have to check it out!",

They still asked if we wanted more drinks during the extra time it took to bring out our food. Food wasn't as good as it usually is. We ordered the bolognese which was overpowered by the amount of lemon zest they put on it. I've had some long wait times here before but this time was exceptionally long. If they don't have the staff to keep up with customers than they might want to think about not opening the patio area.  This was previously a 2 star review but after the restaurant reached out to me I had a great interaction with them and their restaurant and changed my review accordingly. I understand even the best restaurants have bad days but overall I have enjoyed this place and would recommend it.",

We ordered and had asked for everything to come out all at once but one thing that never came out was our pizza. The server had to constantly check on it and eventually told us that the chefs didn't make it right the first time so they had to redo it. We couldn't wait on the pizza or else the other food would get cold. We waited 30 minute total for the fresh pizza. I think they never even made it because we sat right next to the kitchen and never saw the first one come out \"wrong\". Honestly, the pizza should've been comped but it never was and that was the real bummer. The restaurant messed up and they didn't do anything about it. Food was good otherwise but I hope to have a different server and experience when I come back again.",

The menu is not extremely extensive but is varied enough that I would order something different each time I return. We were a group of 9 so I did have the luxury of tasting many items. They were all very good, the pizzas, pasta, and salmon. The above sensational service provided to us by Gianna is what motivated me to write this. She made us feel as though we were the only table she was servicing. Whether it was a suggestion on what  and how to order for a group, to making certain our drinks were topped off, to making sure there were always enough appetizer plates for us. This was all done with a pleasant smile. She made a special occasion that much more joyous for us all. Thank you North and thank you Gianna!!!",

Four of us stopped in for lunch and it was delicious. The Italian Grinder sandwich is large enough to split but don't do it! You will want the whole sandwich for yourself. It does come with either a small salad or potatoes- both delicious. Two of us shared the cheese board that had two cheeses olives, peppers, and spreads for the toasted French bread slices. One person ordered the Caesar salad. All very tasty and fresh.  This restaurant is known for the meatball sandwich so on the second visit (only two of us) we ordered that and the grinder sandwich. Unfortunately we were informed by the server that the meatballs were not ready. Apparently the very particular chef discarded the first batch of meatballs because they were not up to his standard. Wow, that is impressive and it underscores the attention to quality and fresh ingredients! We were impressed that the manager came by to explain. We ate our Grinder sandwich and took a meatball to go since it was ready by the time we finished our meal. My husband enjoyed the meatball sandwich and declared it delicious.  We ordered ice tea and our glasses were refilled frequently.  We sat inside on the first trip and outside on the second trip. The patio is lovely, comfortable and cool. This restaurant is a welcome addition to Summerlin and we will return soon.",

Solid happy hour menu as well. They are lacking the friendly and timely staff for a restaurant like this that I hope improves over time as it is relatively new spot.  The patio is a good size and covered for those rainy Vegas nights.",

The truffle garlic bread was highly recommend by friends so we were very anxious to try. Was swimming in grease. Not my favorite. The chefs board was good; however, was lacking on the amount of cheese we have grown to expect from chefs boards. The pizza was amazing!! It was topped with figs, goat cheese, and arugula and was something I'd order again. My husband didn't really enjoy it on the other hand. Overall, it's pretty good. Dessert wasn't great. We would skip it next time. Would return for happy hour and the beautiful outside seating.",

The only complaint I have is that several times I have gone to the bar to grab a glass of wine before getting sat and the bartenders arent very attentive. I had to wait 15 minutes (real time, not an exageration) for the bartender to even acknowledge that we had even sat down directly infront of her ... Closing our tab was the same time frame.

We felt as though we were guests in her home. She recommended the short rib radiatori and it was phenomenal. I was going to order a San Peligrino but was persuaded to opt for the red sangria, which was a perfect drink the gloomy weather we had. She was a delight and the food was fantastic. Thank you!",

That being said, with only an hour to spare (including travel time) I come prepared with my exact order. The only reason I am giving North Italia a 4 star and not a 5 star is because I really wanted to try their Burrata appetizer (I'm OBSESSED with burrata) only to be told it was sold out. :( So sad...especially since it was just after 12pm. And because my mind was already made, I struggled to decide on my new order. I ended up getting the strozzapreti pasta which was very flavorful and came with lots of chicken, mushrooms, toasted pine nuts (it could have used a tiny bit more spinach for this veggie loving girl). A side note to anyone reading this though..the leftovers do not heat up very well, try to finish it at the restaurant. Now all that being said....the staff was WONDERFUL. Absolutely spectacular. So very tentative and I actually didn't feel like I was dining along. When you go, ask the bartender to tell you his scarecrow joke...hilarious. I may have already posted it on Facebook. A big bravo to all of you...I'll be back, hopefully for some buratta (and that truffle garlic bread).",

The Chefs Board was great and had a variety of different items so there were many variations I could try with the bread, which I loved! The Bacon and Egg pizza was good as well. It felt like it was missing something so we threw on some crushed red pepper for a kick and it was amazing. I remember loving the Pig pizza in Cali, so I knew I'd like it here, and it didn't disappoint. Lots of meat in each bite which made it really flavorful.  I knocked off one star because it took awhile to get water refills, and our server asked my friend and I if we wanted dessert while we were in the middle of eating. Literally still had a few slices left so it made us feel rushed.  Everything else was awesome though, and I will definitely be back for dinner to try everything else on the menu!",

    "text": "I had such high hopes. A Friday night, starting at the outside bar then moving indoors.  We had to flag down someone at the bar after a full 15 minutes of zero eye contact. While waiting for a table that was to take 10 minutes, the host also avoided us until we stepped up to ask for an update. The bartender that did eventually help us knew her stuff, and is a big part of us sticking around. Great info and great recommendation. Over 40 minutes later, and staying because of the great bartender, we finally sat down.  The area is great and the layout is fun - love the huge patio! - but overall it was... meh. Our main server (we seemed to have a server and a million runners) was personable and *seemed* knowledgeable at first, but there were too many corrections to the information she was giving us on wines and dishes that it became a problem. Asking for help from others during long periods of her absence garnered a lot of \"someone will be right with you\".  Again, most staff were personable but for being sloooow, and the atmosphere was as expected (in the best way). The food was fine, but unremarkable based on the pricing and serving for this area.   We felt there were quite a few - we THINK - unintentional bait-and-switch moments with specials/features and wines. Sell us on something... but then so much was out or changed or not as advertised.   I want to try again because it's close by/convenient and I love the space, but after the actual experience I'm reticent to try again.",

    "text": "Our second time dining here... First time was excellent and went back searching for that great experience once more. But it didn't quite work out.  We had reservations, however when we arrived, our table wasn't available so we sat at the bar. After 30 minutes we checked back with the hostess and they claimed they 'looked everywhere' but also said 'I forgot you were at the bar.'  No biggie since we weren't in a hurry, but definitely something in the servics the restaurant can improve upon.   And then dinner... I mentioned to our server that I couldn't have cheese, and I ordered the Strozzapreti prepared the exact same way as in my first visit where they replaced the parmesan cream with a delicious olive oil and garlic sauce. To our group's surprise, it came out with the creamiest, cheesiest, parmesan cream. My husband asked our waitress to confirm it had no cheese and she said it may taste cheesy but had no cheese. Seriously?   We both tasted it..and fortunately I was able to swap dishes with my husband since we both agreed I couldn't have this dish -super cheesy, the aged parmesan was definetly present.  Sad to see that our experience was tainted and our favorite spot with great ambiance,  has fallen off our list because of a non-caring staff member that didn't even offer to prepare a new dish. Sad all around.  Even if the food is great, if they aren't able to cater to customer's needs, then it's a place we can't go to.",

Let me tell you my face/checks and hair were so HOT from the lamps that I was over heating. During my stay, the fans were turned off twice with their blazing heat lamps were on. I asked a male server who was so nice to please put the fans back on, because it was so hot. After a couple of mins the fans were turned off again. I didn't get a chance to cool off yet from the 1st time of the fans being on. I was dying from the heat to where I was feeling nauseous. The girl manager didn't even care and said you can sit inside the restaurant. I asked what's the use of sitting outside when it's suppose to be cooler outside. I told the manager I would just leave to please give me a plastic cup for my ice tea, because it's so hot with the lamps outside without the fans on that I was feeling sick. You would think that 60 degrees it would be cooler and breezy. Nope!They didn't care...maybe the person that was complaining about the fans sitting outside should have gone inside the restaurant. I wasn't even dressed in winter clothes. I had thin sweat pants on with a tank top & light weight sweater. I took off my sweater which of course didn't help. Definitely would not go back!",

While the waiter was very nice I believe they had something going on with the kitchen. It look over an hour for our food to come out and when it finally did my pizza was cold. Additionally all of our food for the table didn't come out together. It took another 10 minutes for 2 people in our party of 7 to receive their meals. I asked to speak to the manager who was nice and apologetic. We then ordered dessert which you would think would have come out faster after complaining but that took about 30 minutes. We arrived at 6:30 and didn't leave until 9:30. I'm all about having a nice dinning experience but 3 hours was a bit ridiculous! I hope that North can turn around their service so they will last. We also had dinner there 3 days before and while the service wasn't as bad as last night we did have to send food back for being cold and it did take a long time to get our food. Good luck  North there are a lot of dinning options in Vegas I hope you can fix your issues quickly before you alienate your Summerlin customers.",

Service was terribble for the low volume of customers in the restaurant.  Had to wait an unreasonably long time for our food.  I ordered ice tea with my meal and because the glass is small, I had to repeatedly ask for refills and no straw or sugar provided. Ordered calamari and it was petrified.  We were offered bread the first time we tried the restaurant and never offered bread this time and a server told us it is because it is up to the descretion of the server. There were just two of us and the total bill was over $70 for lunch. Fortunately, there are many other options for good italian food here in Summerlin (Pasta Idea) that is less pricey.

Desserts were to die for. Share one at least.  Thank you Jennifer, our attentive server. Special personality and graciousness about her.

If I was craving a great Italian meal this would not be the first place to come to mind. However, if a group of friends wanted to drink, socialize and share a few plates we would come here. Meatballs, pizza, salad and pasta dish is usually what we order and just share around the table.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  Really solid new casual Italian restaurant in Summerlin.  Good happy hour, patio perfect for nice days or brunch, and solid wine by the glass list.  You can even get a few more ounces at a discounted price for most pours.  Although the beer list could use some help as there's only about a dozen total bottle/draft.  Menu is new Italian with tons of small plates and appetizers, pizzas for $14, and pastas around $20.  Everything seems sharable from the portion size to the tapas pricing.  The fig pizza, with some added prosciutto, was fantastic.  Tons of meat and thicker crust than your typical craft pizza.  Prosciutto is super thin and perfect compliment to the crust.  The cauliflower appetizer was fine with a few asparagus and an egg, but nothing more than a small opener to a delicious pizza entree.  The restaurant interior is really modern and the bar area is huge.  I would 100% be back for brunch, Happy Hour, or another dinner.  Local option that's perfect for a night out without breaking the bank.",

After being seated it took 15 minutes for someone who wasn't even our server to realize no one had greeted us at our table (it wasn't even busy).  Our server finally came and we ordered the truffle bread, the house specialty bolognese, and the short rib riadatori. The truffle bread was delicious, but the bolognese was all pasta noodles and tiny specs of meat, which I think is a rip off considering it costs $18 for the dish. The short rib riadatori had a strong lemonish sour zest to it that just seemed odd for a pasta sauce and we found it pretty hard to enjoy. I also asked for Parmesan cheese, and our server brought us a little cup of the crumbled Parmesan cheese, it wasn't freshly grated which is strange for being an Italian restaurant.   I'm not sure if it's because we had a late reservation, but the staff was being pretty loud and hanging out 2 tables down from us counting money and doing their closing duties. It just seemed a bit unprofessional to be doing those things so close to their guests while they are trying to enjoy dinner in my opinion.   I'm sad to say my experience here was disappointing to say the least.",

Great small plate and app options. I like that the menu has some traditional Italian  dishes and some updated more modern and equally delicious options. Pasta dishes are also amazing and the portions are the perfect size not too big not too small .You can tell the ingredients are fresh and clean. The staff is super friendly. Only complaint is the parking in that shopping center stinks.",

We started with the vegetable salad, an order of the cauliflower, both were very tasty, great texture and very fresh. I had the Branzino and its some of the best I've had in a long time. Others had the Scallops and the Risotto and the Bolognese. the service and the atmosphere were great. I will return and try their pizza, it looked really good",

We were greeted with a Smile as usual by all of the staff that were near the entrance. We opted for the Calamari app which turned out super as it was beer battered on top of a well seasoned arugula. Then we had some Zucca chips which was a Zuccini sliced wafer thin like a potato chip and cooked and seasoned with perfection. Our main meal after the Italian Bread with Oil & Balsamic was a Chicken base with roasted mushrooms spinach & toasted Pine Nut & a parmesan cream sauce. OMG it probably our Favorite since this is the 2nd or 3rd time we have had it. The restaurant has a vast menu of wine and of coarse all the alcohol  that normally a complete bar has. Janae was a very good server as they  have some of the Best there. Tim as always was a very cordial host. Thanks North Italia for making our last nite out for 2018 Perfect.",

We had a birthday dinner with the family, a table of 9. We had the kids with us as well and the waiter seemed to be very annoyed by them. They are good kids and behaved very well, and this is a family restaurant after all. She was very snobby and condescending. a good example was her eye roll and how shocked she was, when we were surprised by her question of \"what level of cooking would you like the salmon\"? when we asked what that means (it's not a steak or a burger) she rolled her eyes and sighed.  I think management should look into the actual service as it seems to be the only week link in the reviews. Food is amazing, and the restaurant itself is beautiful.",

Its always be so hot and each bite is so flavorful. The chefs plate is to die for.  I truly feel these negative comments on here are to make this restaurant look not only bad,  but to make them seem very unprofessional, and the complaints aren't genuine. I'm sure the team hears about these comments because I know my place of employment does and it can be hard listening to negative comments that customers feel they need express. Even when a situation is solved and your meals are gratis. The chefs even go out of there way to prepare special request for items that aren't even on the menu.   This restaurant is outstanding and I recommend it to all my friends and family. The prices are great especially since everything is made from scratch. Some servers are better than others but they still provide great service. Thank you North Italia for always making each visit beyond exceptional and exceeding expectations, you guys and gals rock!!",

Some of the pastas not in love with but will continue to try more menu items.  Bread with Ricotta was good.  Staff nice.  Good lemonade and tea.  Updated 1/15 - went yesterday for brunch and ordered the short rib hash and the breakfast burrito.  We have decided that after a handful of trips to North Italia we are over unimpressed with the showing of items we have tried and will take a rest from trying more items.  I would say the food is average quality and meant to please a crowd.",

The vibe is welcoming and the fresh made daily  pasta & pizza dough is delicious!  Our overall service was pretty consistent considering their recent grand opening!  FOOD Crisp Calamari $13 Highly recommended golden brown calamari paired with arugula and lemon of course. Great portion size for the price. Tortellini $17 This vegetarian friendly main dish was smaller than I anticipated but filling.  Daily Pizza (Potato Spinach) $14 SURPRISINGLY SPICY and our server failed to mention it before ordering. Thankfully I'm about that spice life! My first potato pizza and I enjoyed it.  Dirty Almond Chai $5.00 This latte was refreshing & filthy at the same time and I enjoyed every sip!

It's located in a strip mall but the place was big with tables inside and out.  After we were seated, our eyes were drawn to the soup of the day:  butternut squash!  Our all-time favorite so we each naturally had to order a bowl.  Our appetizer was the Burrata which was a decadent date pistachio cheesy concoction.  We devoured that in no time.  The soup was creamy comfort food at it's best.  My entree was the chicken pesto and the hubby got the house special bolognese.  I must confess that after the appetizer and soup, I was 3/4 full so I picked at my entree...certain I would have enjoyed it more if I had room in my stomach.  Hubby happily finished his bolognese.

My girls and I wanted to meet in the middle since we were coming from different areas, Southwest and North side. North Italia was the spot, nicely situated in Boca Park. We sat in the outdoor patio, which was nice since they had the warmers. I love how open and spacious the restaurant is. Decor was beautiful. This would be a great place to have big groups, lots of seatings available.   We shared the Prosciutto Pizza with gluten free crust (extra $2.50), Chicken Parmesan, and Spaghetti and Meatballs (substituted with Rotini pasta). Wow. Everything was amazing. I love how the fig and goat cheese complimented each other in the prosciutto pizza. The crust was neither stiff as a cardboard or too doughy. The chicken parm had all the right amounts of melted cheeses. The Pasta and meatballs was a good traditional taste, it did have a little spice to it that I liked. Oh, and for dessert...the Hazelnut Torta. It's  Salted caramel gelato on top a warm brownie with toffee pieces and Nutella cream. Need I say more?",

The cocktails are refreshing and made well too. We got the charcuterie board - highly recommend this! Our waiter told us everything that was on it because we were so in love with all of the different items. I took my parents here and I will say it's the nicest meal I have had in a long time, and the experience itself will make me return soon.

Not a fan (apparently I am basically the only one).   For my entree I got the chicken parm.  The chicken itself was  good quality white meat chicken but the flavors didn't do anything for me.  Plus I found it to be extremely salty.   Portion was pretty big and the pasta it came with was okay.  The wife went for the divers scallops.  She enjoyed it. I tried it and didn't.    For dessert was the tiramisu.  I'd say it was like 90% marscapone and about 10% lady fingers at most.   When the waitress came around and asked how it was, she could tell we weren't feeling it.    Everyone else loves this place and it was packed so maybe you take this review with a grain of salt.  Maybe I have stupid taste buds???  The waitress was very attentive and always had my soda refilled fast.  Which is appreciated.   Restaurant is clean and stylish.   The couple next to us was a little close and loud for comfort.   But like they say \"it is what it is\".  We won't be back most likely.   Food... meh to me.  But service was good.",

All the staff were friendly and engaging. My waiter was prompt and attentive. The menu has drinks on one side and their is plenty to choose from. As a solo diner and driving myself I only had water to drink. I ordered the bolognese which on the menu said it was a house specialty.   The food was really good. The meat sauce was hearty with the ratio of pasta. However, and this is the ding, the overall portion left me still hungry. Knowing what the price was for my pasta. I feel that I should be full when I'm done eating.   $21.56 pasta plus tip. You can't throw in a small salad or a piece of tasty bread?",

    "text": "To be honest I am shocked that I am just now writing a review because I have been coming here every week since they opened (which means it's a great place)! This just a guaranteed go-to place if you want an amazing meal. Their salads, the simple salad (pictured) and seasonal vegetable are my favorite, but they are all really excellent. Their salmon is also really well done- I usually add it to a salad. My other go to dish is their meatballs. DELISH. Such a solid restaurant. I have never been here and been disappointed with my food (EXCEPT FOR THE RARE CHANCE THEY RUN OUT OF SOMETHING- which does happen)! Another MUST is their iced unsweetened green tea. Not sure how they make it, but it out does anyyyy other that I have ever had- I could live off of it. The wait staff is not that great which is why I have put 4 stars. There are a select few that are good, but the rest are rushing and not present whatsoever when talking to you or taking your order- as if you're unsure if they're paying attention to what you're saying, which can be frustrating. It's just hit or miss, often times a bit worse when it's packed (which is often). The atmosphere, both indoor and outdoor, is amazing, clean, and well done! Love love this place & always look forward to returning.",

Our family has become somewhat of pizza snobs over the last few years taking trips to Italy and NYC. So getting run of the mill pizza really isn't our thing anymore...with that being said we were all so glad we came across this place. The atmosphere is top notch and the food is the same. The thin crust pizza done in super hot ovens is on point and when it comes out it is still bubbling...careful you can burn your mouth. Not sure about some of the other not so positive reviews, but I would look right over those and see this place for what it is....  We ended up sharing a few dishes among friends and family... we shared the prosciutto and fig pizza, spicy salami and arugula pizza, bacon and egg pizza, margherita pizza, meatballs, crispy zucchini slices and calamari. Everything was spectacular and despite all the choices my favorite was and always be a really good margherita pizza. I know simple and plain but this pie was amazing. Everyone loved the  items and it was great sharing.  If you are in Vegas and don't travel a short ways off the strip you are truly missing out....",

It was an all around great experience and our server, Jennifer was excellent.      We ordered the seasonal vegetable salad and it was the exact right amount to split between three adults, this salad was unique (a salad we won't forget). The restaurant manager stopped by to ask us how we were doing we said, \"good\". Then, we also ordered the grilled artichoke as an appetizer and this is the only part of our meal that fell short in anyway the artichoke had no \"meat\" on it so there was nothing there to eat, but our server was very nice about it when we told her and didn't make us feel awkward for pointing it out.     My husband ordered a margarita pizza, I ordered the salmon, and my friend ordered the scallops, while our children both got the spaghetti. Everything we ordered was very good! The sauce for the children's spaghetti had a strong garlic taste and oregano which my son was happy about but my friend's daughter found to be \"spicy\" so just as a warning to some parents maybe order the sauce on the side if you have a picky eater. As for all of the adults we where completely impressed with our meals, everything was cooked perfectly with a wonderful presentation and flavor combinations that worked well together!       A little later the manager came by again and I heard her ask about the artichoke we had sent back saying, \"You didn't like the artichoke?\" My friend and I both answered at the same time, \"we liked the flavor just there was no meat on it.\" She then said, \"But I came by earlier and you guys were happy?\" It was weird the way she said this almost like accusing us of something and she had a look on her face that was very off putting I didn't know how to react we just told her everything else is very good and we where going to order dessert. We decided to brush it off because we where enjoying everything else so much and our server was great. But the manager was slightly disrespectful towards us, everyone noticed. I am not going to change my review for this because that's how much we enjoyed our meal we're willing to over look it, but a customer should be able to send something back if needed, without being made to feel awkward or a manager seeming to imply we where lying.       My friend ordered a cocktail that she liked a lot, and my husband a beer, then we all ordered desserts and everyone was impressed with the desserts as well. We'll hopefully be back soon and I'll share more pictures.",

Luckily the place is large and they are utilizing their outdoor seating with a covered patio and heaters. Inside is more fun as you can smell the aromas coming from the kitchen.   For cocktails we got the Milano mule, it was tasty, unexpected it was served in a glass instead of a coppercup. The other cocktail we got was the Apple bourbon sour. It was very refreshing and tasted just like an apple cinnamon. It was smart how they didn't give a straw so you get the aroma of cinnamon.   The prosciutto fig goat cheese pizza had very tender prosciutto, and was generally piled on. The goat cheese and fig added a nice sweet and savory fruity flavor with the arugula giving a good crunch. The crust was a little much, but it worked great as a delivery system for the goodies.   The bolognese pasta was so delicious. The pasta was tender and the sauce beefy and tomatoey. I told my friend it tastes like pasta that if I had my own italian  grandma at home. A definite comfort food after a long week at work.   The squid ink pasta was delicious. Perfect al dente and a little heat to warm you up inside. The seafood in the dish was just an add on. I could have just eaten the past by itself. It would also taste great with squid ink pasta and the bolognese sauce, would be perfect too.  Service was spot on at our visit. Water cups did not stay low for very long and we were checked on by our waitress multiple times.",

We didn't make a reservation and the place was packed, but we only ended up waiting about 30 mins. This place has a beautiful ambiance like somewhere on the Strip without actually being on the Strip. It's located right across the street from Boca Park near Honey Salt.  For food we started with the Arancini. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and stuffed with goodness. The sauce is really what made this one a winner though, super rich and delicious taste. (4/5) As an entree I had the vegetarian friendly Burrata Tortellini. The broth, omg, SO good! I ate every single piece of this dish and loved all of it. (5/5) My boo had the chicken parmesan which he said was phenomenal. I was able to try some of his pasta on the side which was super tasty. I would get the penne just on its own as an entree if I could. We then topped the meal off with some tiramisu (5/5). I loved the crunchy bites on the top and the flavors were very good.   I really cannot get enough of this place. They make all of their pastas and dough in house and it shows in the tastes. I will be back here again soon I'm sure and recommend it to others as well.",

One of our other friends had a huge bowl of mussels that tasted delightful. Another had N.I.'s Sangria that was very tasty.  A couple of us had happy hour wine that really hit the spot.

On Friday night my partner & I arrived @ 4:45 & had a booth on the patio, against the wall next to the outside, while we enjoyed a breeze.  My partner, a playwright who's never without a pipe in his breast pocket & a notebook, was instantly called to task by the woman next to us:  \"Your pipe is giving me a headache & it stinks.\"  Very quickly our server returned to reprimand him by saying \"We have a no smoking policy & I can smell your pipe.\"  We almost in unison told him he didn't even have his pipe lit outside so how could this woman be so irritated by this pipe containing no tobacco?  [In fact, my partner is known for being a very polite smoker, even when in a casino.]    So, there was our server, another employee & a manager descending on us, all to accuse my partner of smelling like live smoke.  He became angry, of course being incredulous that now 3 employees have come to the aid of the woman next to us.  Our server told us he got 3 calls about the smoking & then the manager appeared to say they received 2 more calls about the smoking, & at the same time said  \"I'll have the girl bring you the check & you can go on your merry little way & smoke wherever you want!\"  The public embarrassment in a very busy patio was slanderous & malicious; in fact, we've never experienced anything like this.  And still... cannot forget the hideous night at North Italia.  Let this lesson be our guide.",

    "text": "Happy Hour: Monday - Thursday 3PM-6PM.  Scientific research and data analysis tells us that writing Yelp reviews is getting pricier and pricier.  In fact, the most commonly reviewed places every year are restaurants.  So with that, an expert foodie like myself and others who have at least 10 reviews and 10 pictures posted, would suggest taking advantage of Happy Hours around town!    Welcome North Italia's Happy Hour!  I love you for your $20 Bottle & Board [(italics) choose one: pizza, bruschetta, or chef's board & (bold) a bottle of the red or white].  BUT I've been here about about 4 times now, the first visit Carrot Top was there, second visit was with the parentals, third and fourth being Happy Hour.    The one dish I always order is the truffle garlic bread (it's not a Happy Menu item); it's so damn good.  Just know it's enough for 4 people.  The homemade ricotta cheese that accompanies the garlic bread just slays this dish.  It was a subtle drop but let me say again that this $20 happy hour item comes with a bottle of house white or red wine!  Enjoy.",

It was fairly empty when we got there, it was an early dinner/late lunch around 5 when we got there, so the menu I believe was the lunch one.  For starters, we got The Truffle Italian Bread, which is, legit, a mountain of bread with a dabble of cheese on top, and it's soaked in Olive Oil and Hot. Bringing the term \"breaking bread\" to the max.  Next we all got Ceasars, and we are big Ceasar mavens, everybody loved theirs. It's hard to impress New Yorkers with Italian Food, and this spot really nailed it.  I had the Mushroom Tortellini Pasta, which is buried in sauce, the way it should be, and was super filling and flavorful. Topped off with some wine was the best italian meal I've had in Vegas.  Highly Recommend for your Italian Dinner Out!!",

The bread alone took almost 30 minutes to come out. It was just 4 small slices of bread with olive oil and cheese on top, not sure why in the world it took that long.   Our food took another 20 minutes or so. It was really the longest I've ever waited for a meal. I was hoping the wait was worth it, sadly it was not. My spaghetti and meatballs was just ok. The meatballs not bad, my problem is the noodles. Way undercooked, it was rushed. I wasn't even gonna bother to tell my waiter, because I couldn't stand waiting any longer for a new dish. Just not worth it. Price point is off for me. $18 for a spaghetti and meatballs?? I expected something sort of amazing.   We will not be returning. But it seems to be popular and has many positive reviews. Try it out for yourself, maybe it was just me?",

The lettuce was brown & pink & the dressing was the consistency of coffee creamer. I will give kudos for the croutons though. Otherwise, that salad was worth $4. The actual pasta in the bolognese was good, but sort of all stuck together in a clump. The lemon donuts were probably the best part. Honestly, for my italian cravings, I'll stick to Nora's or Maggiano's.",

Love the interior... love the vibe.... love the volume of music (yes that makes a difference, especially when I'm screaming to have a decent conversation). Either choosing to sit inside with simple and clean decor offering intimate open seating, or outside cozy by the fire you win. My mother appreciated the high backs on the chairs and now wants to purchase them for her home. It's a great date spot for dinner since the ambience can be very romantic.   Food Not too pricey, but quality Italian food and a great wine list!  The meatballs and Zucca chips are appetizer favorites! Calamari is fried to perfect and served with fresh arugula. Must try! But the winner is its breakfast egg sandwich (served before lunch) with fried potatoes.  Just don't order anything else, very filling and good size portions!",

I ordered the Julietta, which was a sweet and refreshing martini. My friend ordered the cucumber martini. The presentation on both were nice and they were crafted very well.   We ordered the following appetizers:  Roasted cauliflower-served in a hot skillet. Was crispy and had really good flavor. The fried egg was a nice compliment to the roasted veggies.   Meatballs-served in a hot skillet with a side of garlic bread. Good flavor and a good table share plate.   Caesar salad-fresh and flavorful   White truffle garlic bread-good plate to share for the table. One of our favorites. Crispy and soft bread topped with fresh ricotta cheese.   We each ordered an entree and they were all really good. Nice size portions and good flavor. We had some leftovers.   Chicken Parmesan-crispy and flavorful. Served with a side of pasta with cream sauce.   Chicken pesto pasta-another favorite. Pasta tossed with pesto sauce and topped with grilled chicken and pine nuts. Really tasty.   Squid ink pasta-flavorful and had a bit of a spicy kick   Short rib pasta-sliced short rib on cream pasta served with arugula. Short rib was tasty and tender.   Scallops-served medium which was perfect. Really good flavor and texture.   All in all we really liked this restaurant. The food and service were great. Good place for date night or groups.

    "text": "The restaurant seemed a little sparsely decorated, but it still felt comfortable. Not much of an Italian theme though. The have what looked like a very nice patio outside as well. The service we had was excellent and the food was extremely good.  My spaghetti bolognese was basic yet very unique and was some of the best I have ever had in a restaurant.   While we will definitely go back at some point in time, I was shocked at how small the portion of spaghetti bolognese was. It was essentially they exact size that a nutritionist will tell you to eat and not a hearty size you would expect from a restaurant. I honestly think it should have literally been twice as much pasta, especially considering they charge prices in line with what you pay on the Las Vegas Strip.  I was also disappointed there was no bread with dinner.   All in all, highly recommend North Italia, just be warned it is on the pricier side for a suburban restaurant.",

    "text": "Let's start with the good: - Calamari was delicious. I'm a big fan of arugula and I loved how much arugula there was. The grilled lemon on the side was a nice touch. - Bolognese (!!!) pasta was perfectly al dente and sauce was top-notch. Portion size was a little small considering a plate was $19, but whatever. - Diver Scallops were a hit as well. The portion size was also very underwhelming...maybe 3/4 of a cup of risotto + 3 scallops. However, very delicious. The risotto by itself is salty, but when you take a bite of everything together, it's a perfect bite. - Bombolini dessert...YUM. I loved the lemon curd + vanilla mascarpone combination with the fluffy, piping hot doughnuts. I could eat 20 of those EASILY.  Now on to the not-so-good: the service. Stay tuned because this is going to be a doozy. Our server was one of those people who just oozes that \"I hate my job\" vibe. This doesn't bother me if I'm at a McDonald's drive thru at 2 am, but if I'm at a relatively nice restaurant, I expect at least a certain level of fake enthusiasm. After our appetizers, our entrees came out in batches...the timing was really off. 4 people in our party ordered the bolognese, but we waited a good 10 min after the first bolognese was served to us to get the last bolognese. During this time, no one said anything to us until our server came up 5 mins after everyone else's entrees were up and asked us, \"They already told you guys that food is coming up in a few minutes right?\" First of all, who's \"they\"? And second, shouldn't he have been the one to communicate with us if there was a delay?   Our server also made a few condescending remarks to our party which were probably meant to be funny. For example, he told one of our friends who ordered a dessert for themselves, \"yeah you should definitely share that dessert...haha just kidding.\" Adding a just kidding to the end of an insult doesn't make it less insulting. It was really awkward. It was a friend's birthday, and on Yelp, we saw that North gives a complimentary salted caramel budino for birthdays. We let our server know about the birthday. When it came time to order dessert, our server asked our friend if he was sure he didn't want anything...but then brought out a scoop of gelato with a candle on it. That was fine, but the server rang that gelato up on our bill. We didn't even want it or ask for it - when we asked why we got charged, he said he \"could take it off\" as if he was doing us a favor. Other weird things happened throughout the night like I was taking a sip of water and before I could even put the glass back down on the table, someone took it out of my hand to refill it. After everything, our server still gave us a hard time about the uncorking fee. We had called beforehand and the hostess had confirmed with us that we could bring 2 bottles of our own and we would get charged $20 for a party of 4. Since we were a party of 10, she said we could bring 4 bottles and get charged $40. We confirmed this TWICE. Our server rang up $20 per bottle which was twice the amount we were expecting. When we talked to him about it, he said he doesn't talk to the hostess and doesn't know what goes on in the front (like what??? Bro, you ARE in the front). Only after getting management involved was our original price of $40 for 4 bottles was honored. The server then gave us a stern warning saying \"next time, you can only do 2 bottles for $20\" and \"we can't have a free-for-all.\" Like chill out dude, we're literally costing the restaurant nothing by bringing our own wine and we are paying for you to take 5 min to figure out how to uncork a wine bottle tableside lmao.  Overall, the food was great, but the server was just bad and completely un-apologetic, blaming everything on everyone else. I would come back because of the food, but if I got that server again, I would definitely ask for someone else.",

As you can see from the pictures we got an array of dishes. Everything was delish, but my favorites were: Squid ink mafaldine- tangy with a kick of spice. Daily pizza- packed with flavor. Affogatto- great way the end a meal, with a shot of espresso and ice cream. It also had chocolate coffee beans. We had leftovers and I was excited to have it the following day.

There was 6 of us and we ordered almost half the menu (some pictured, some not pictured) and I'm not kidding when I say each dish was delectable, delightful, and overall delicious...aka everything was orgasmic.   We ordered Italian meatballs, Chef's board, Crispy calamari, Arancini, Black Mediterranean mussels, Daily pizza (for the life of me I can't spell or remember the name but it had sausage, white sauce, broccolini, and garlic), Short rib radiatori, Roasted salmon, Italian farm salad, Squid ink mafaldine, and Strozzapreti. I highly recommend all of them. Just get them all! Haha.   For dessert we got hazelnut torta, affogato, and chocolate gelato. Again, just get them all! You won't regret any of them. The hazelnut torta was topped with salted caramel gelato and a piece of hazelnut toffee. I want to know if they sell the toffee in bulk because that was the most delicious piece of toffee I ever had.   Our server was TC (I hope I spelled it correctly). She was awesome! She reminds me of Bernadette from Big Bang Theory - sweet and knowledgeable...and she kinda looks like her too :)   Dress code is casual. Happy hour is Mon-Thurs from 4-6pm I believe.   I will definitely be back! I have my eye on the tiramisu next.",

She got very defensive immediately and said  \"do you want to speak to the manager\"....we stated that it wasn't a matter of manager....but a principal rule that if there is a reservation then they shall hold tables, right? We have it the benefit of the doubt and waited until 6.45pm when they sat us. The service was mediocre at best....the Black Mediterranean Mussels were OUTSTANDING! (appetizer). By the way, got the mussels 30 minutes later after being seated. We ordered seabass and scallops over risotto as main course. Again, mediocre at best. Seabass was very fatty and the garnishments were cold! No appetizing, but pricey so we eat it. The scallops over risotto were decent, but borderline salty....we served our main course another 30 minutes after the appetizer. Therefore, were did not complain about entrees since just wanted to finish the dinner. Would not recommend this place unless you order salads or pizzas,perhaps, that it looked like pretty much every one else on the floor was ordering.",

    "text": "After hearing about North Italia from several different people, I finally decided to give it a shot. My family and I managed to grab one of the last few remaining reservations on a Saturday night. Walking into the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the staff and asked for our reservation details. Looking around the restaurant, the decor and ambiance is upscale with a fresh, modern look. For an Italian place, it's actually very refreshing to see these modern finishes as opposed to the classic Italian designs.   Our server was around to start with drink orders promptly and began to explain their food philosophy and house specials (they have a soup and pizza special every day). We started with some house bread as an app which was served with a plate of olive oil with balsamic already added. The house bread was well baked with the crunchy crust and soft inside as its supposed to be! Our server stopped by to take our order and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu (she knew the portion size of meat offerings in the dishes)! I placed an order for the Bolognese which is a house special while the family decided on the Chicken Parm and Strozzapreti. Speaking for the Bolognese, I have to say it was incredibly delicious and it would not be a stretch to say possibly the best in town! The tagliatelle pasta was fresh while the meat sauce was perfectly mixed all topped off with a right (at least, I think so) amount of cheese. In regards to the other dishes, from what I heard, they were well made, fresh, and delicious as well. Despite being full from the main courses, we convinced ourselves to place an order for two different desserts: a hazelnut torta and a tiramisu. Due to a small mishap, we also happened to get the strawberry tart for free! I decided to dig on the tiramisu and the torta. The chocolate mousse balls that topped the tiramisu really just set apart the dish from everything else and was exceptionally well balanced in terms of sweetness.",

Walking up they have a large open air patio with a fireplace and overhead fans and heaters.   We ate here with some friends on opening night and the place was busy yet organized.  As a carb-lovin vegetarian I really liked the White Truffle Garlic Bread with house made ricotta but also the Burrata with winter squash was beautifully plated with lots of toasted hazelnuts.   The Burrata Tortelloni was surprisingly light and served with a roasted mushroom, swiss chard, and porcini broth. Our waiter highly recommended this saying it's his favorite pasta on the menu, and I have to agree it was very good.",

Service = hit or miss depending on how busy they are (I would give service a 3-star)  Price = reasonable with larger portions and the quality is great  Happy hour? = Excellent! You get a steal with this place and it's offered Monday thru Thursday from 3-6 pm   Highly recommend reservations especially on weekends and Friday's. I use OpenTable to get the points!   There are indoor and outdoor seating. Each time I come here, it's at night so I prefer to sit outside on the patio because inside it's too loud. The bar has a great selection of wines, beers, and well drinks.   I will definitely come back here again. However, I won't be back when it's busy because the service becomes sub-par when they are too busy.   My favorite things to order are:   The garlic bread: crispy bread loaded with garlic and cheese! Nom nom nom  Short rib pasta: huge portion so it's a great dish to share  Any of the pizzas: North Italia knows how to make amazing, fluffy dough topped with quality ingredients for all their pizza's. Comes with about 8 slices so it's a great dish to share as well.  Tiramisu: YUMMM. Comes with little chocolate wafer balls so you get a nice crunch.   Overall, 4-stars.   Happy Dining,  JT",

In the crowded west side food scene, North Italia is making waves from the beginning.  The food is great, nice selection of salads, flatbreads, pastas and mains. I'm more than happy with all my selections. Tonight I pigged out, simple salad, pasta bolognese, chicken parm, also tried farm salad and chicken noodle soup. All delicious.  Ambiance was bustling. Nice indoor/outdoor thing going with bar in between. Not a sports bar vibe but was able to catch some March Madness and Hockey by reserving a high top near bar. Go Knights.  The service was friendly but not really attentive. They forgot to replace my silverware after taking it on my second and third courses. I waited 5-6 minutes for a fork with nobody around.  Still a good value and do appreciate the server recommending the third cheapest cab which was a great value. Nice touch. Decent wine list.  I will be back. Yum yum",

We ordered the margherita pizza and heirloom tomato appetizers, they were incredible. The pizza had great texture and the sauce was tangy with just a hint of sweet. The heirloom tomatoes were super sweet with the perfect amount of dressing, the cheese they use melts in your mouth like butter, is super fresh and cold. Moving on to the entrees, we ordered cheese tortellini, spaghetti and meatballs, and i ordered the house special bolognese. We all tasted and shared, they were all excellent and i was extremely happy with my choice and would order it again. But the star was the cheese tortellini. This dish is incredible, the cheese inside was so delicate and the pasta was perfectly al dente. It had many layers and diamension to the flavor.

    "text": "I have had mostly wonderful experiences at North Italia. We tried it as soon as it opened, and were blown away by the awesome food, drinks, and service. My husband ordered the filet, and I ordered the short ribs on our first visit. We were both in heaven-- he says it's now his go-to steak in Vegas! (Also, pretty affordable for a filet at $38.) The flavors are great, the portions are perfect, and you really get your money's worth in my opinion on a normal day. I highly recommend the Arancini appetizer as well. Yum!   The one time our experience was less than perfect was on Valentine's Day. They had a pre-fixe menu at $55 per person, offering an appetizer, a main (5 featured entrees from their normal menu) and a dessert. Not bad, especially for the area. However, I ordered scallops and risotto which seemed under cooked. Service was really slow, as well. They also ran out of the desserts so we settled for gelato. I didn't feel like this particular special event was worth it.   Overall, on a normal day of service, I love North Italia but I don't think I would return for one of their pre-fixe events. I could also chalk it up to growing pains, as they only just opened and it was probably their first time doing something like that.",

    "text": "Meh... I was dying to try this place after discovering it on yelp. The pictures were so captivating, I just had to try it. Sadly 3 Stars is a bit of a stretch for our experience at North. The food was lacking and the service was just awful. The waitress disappeared for long periods of time which led to our food being cold and us ultimately passing on desert strictly because of her poor service skills.   Back to the food. After weeks of salivating over those fantastic images I still couldn't decide what I wanted, so needless to say, we over-ordered. See the results below.  Started with the calamari, white truffle garlic bread and the specialty pizza of the day.   Fried calamari arrived on a bed of greens. The taste was very good, however it was cold. I think had the calamari been hot and greens cold this dish could have been elevated to the next level.   Meatball pizza was just \"eh\".  We really only got it for research purposes, and I can honestly say, while it's not bad, it's not the reason to go here.   Garlic bread was prepared very well. Soft inside and crispy outside.   The Bolognese (house specialty) as well came out cold which was disappointing on a brisk winter day. A steaming hot bowl of pasta was just what was in order, I unfortunately had to settle for a lukewarm one. The pasta was good, the sauce was good...   Chicken Parm was moist and not too fried or anything. Not great, not bad.  Overall, this was a disappointingly adequate meal. I am willing to give it another shot and hope for a hot meal and good service. Just not sure I'm in any rush to return.",

We ordered quite a selection because we had our 2 adult kids and wanted to taste everything & give them left overs for work . The pastas  were bland & needed salt .    Our first pizza ( spinach and fig ) was beautiful  , but the second was so burnt and thin it didn't even look like it came from the same restaurant!  One person  at  our table had the chicken Parmesan and it was good but the pasta was cold and bland. The pesto was weak ,& our roasted cauliflower was so burnt that it was inedible . The Burrata appetizer was really artistic & great fusion of flavors . (That alone is enough for a light meal ). The doughnut type dessert on lemon was super sugary (crystals not dissolved in the dough ) & tasted like stale grease was used to fry it in .  Our waiter Amos was darling and attentive , so that saved the night . But for the price we paid for dinner ... frustrating to say the least ! I don't usually complain about restaurants , BUT WOW !  Perhaps drinking numbs the palate , because the drinking crowd seemed happy ;) to be fair , I wanted to give 2&1/2 to 3 stars ..",

    "text": "*****REVIEW UPDATE:  GREAT EXPERIENCE!****  Below was a review from a dining experience at NoRTH Italia.  They really do care about these reviews because the GM Cole contacted me via email and we spoke personally.  He listened to my concerns and said, \"Your feedback is how we improve.  We need this!  I'm so sorry it happened and we'd like to show you how we really treat our guests!\"   Cole invited us back and we had an GREAT EXPERIENCE!  The service and food were totally on point!  The scallops were done to perfection! Every person staff person was terrific.  They made the birthday celebration a special evening from beginning to end.   Their attention to detail and professionalism was evident ~ flowed smoothly on a very busy Saturday night.    Cole and his team totally turned a bad situation around. So many other businesses may not bother acknowledging a poor review. At NoRTH Italia, they welcomed the opportunity to fix a problem(s) and create a long term customer.  Although they are new in town, they certainly understand HOW customer service is done. CONGRATULATIONS and THANK YOU!!  Looking forward to our next NoRTH Italia dining experience!  ****************************************************************************************** Horrible Experience  We've been here several times and the service is inconsistent to say the least.   Today, was way beyond inconsistent!   They had seated two huge parties one of 35 and the other of 20. They offered to seat us outside on the patio with a heater that took about 15 minutes to light.  Our server never showed up while other tables around us were being waited on.  After going to the host, one showed up and she was very nice and did her best.  We had our food checked on - it didn't show up either.  Other parties seated long after us were eating.  Finally, my french toast arrived along with our other meals.  Mine was awful ~ barely grilled on one side.    The manager did come over to our table (once because the server told him, another time because we flagged him down).  Their response both times was \"let me check with the kitchen and see what's going on.\"  Even after he saw my uncooked meal, his concern was bringing it back to the kitchen so \"they could see it.\"  How about asking if you could make me something else?   NOTE TO NORTH ITALIA STAFF:  GUESTS ARE HERE TO ENJOY A MEAL AND HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE.  WE ARE NOT HERE TO WORK OUT YOUR OPERATIONAL ISSUES!  Things can and do happened.  As long time residents of LV we've had our share of good and bad restaurants.  It's ALL about how you recover and fix the experience.  In my opinion, and that of another tables seated near us having similar issues today, this place has a couple of issues: 1) The front-end staff (host, managers) are young and inexperienced for this type of an establishment.  They're trying to give off an upbeat, hip vibe which is great.  HOWEVER, that needs to be done with an experienced, professional staff.   As another guest table said, \"they need more grey hair running this place; They're kids.\"  2)  Again, from an experience standpoint, who would book two large parties at the same time, without adding staff?  This place isn't that big!  People can have large parties,  but how about staggering the timing?  How about adding staff? How about a private room like other restaurants in town?  The situation today sacrificed a ton of customer service due to poor planning on their part.  We get that you are new and want the exposure and business.  Our experience today (and another during the holidays)  clearly speaks to North Italia needing work in several areas.  They may be busy now, but if this continues, their guest won't continue putting up with inconsistent and bad experiences. Their are simply too many other choices in town.",

We waited ten minutes after we were sat to be greeted by our waiter. Who took our drink order, only brought one water (four people) and forgot the other three drinks (2 beers and a red sangria), which weren't served till our entrees came out after being reminded twice. My appetizer of soup came out less than one minute before my entree of spaghetti, which was almost cleared away immediately. 8 had to stop the waiter and tell him, \"I just got this\". Every other table around us got bread to snack on. We didn't. I asked for bread three times and was only brought it after our meal. The check then took another 15 mins. What was troubling is that it wasn't busy at all. There were numerous empty tables on the patio.",

Our waitress was very attentive gave us excellent service throughout the evening, especially with our large and at times demanding party. The buratta and chefs board appetizers were perfectly sized to share. Both the Caesar and seasonal vegetable salads were wonderfully fresh and just the right size. Everyone liked their entrees, but especially the bolognese, chicken pesto, and prosciutto pizza. The bolognese paired well with the valpolicella ripasso on the reserve wine list. We will definitely be back!",

I told them between 15-20 people and they refused to give us a reservation unless we could come after 3pm. Seriously? That doesn't work since we meet at 1pm each week at a new restaurant to review the food. I even offered to split up into 3-4 tables for their convenience. No go said the restaurant. OK. So decided to chance it at the door. So we all came and finally they said we could eat on the patio with the heaters turned on. That worked except it was 50 mile an hour winds and about 49 degrees that day.  The food was OK. I got ill on my portion of spaghetti and meatballs and the calamari was not good. Not sure if they spit in my food or not. Others had the ink pasta, Bolognese pasta, salads, pizza, calamari, sandwiches, etc. Very mixed impressions from our group. The waiter we had was very good but so rushed. Not sure how many other tables he was trying to take care of but he was pleasant and tried very hard. I would recommend only if you are coming with 2-3 people and then I would watch what I ordered.",

The first thing I thought was weird was that my reservation was for 6:45 and at 6:40 they called and asked if I was still coming, even after I confirmed via their text service earlier that day. The party was only 5 on the reservation so it wasn't like they were confirming a massive party. Next, we ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress spilled it on my mom. Not only did my mom have to ask for napkins after she was spilled on, the waitress didn't comp the bottle or at the very least didn't get us a new bottle when she was the one who spilled it. Next, she brought us the wine but the other two people who ordered beers didn't get their beers for 40 minutes, until the food came. Very strange and poor service. The waitress was training someone the entire time. I understand that everyone needs to be trained but maybe they should have someone train that knows more of what they are doing. I give 2 stars because the FOOD was AMAZING. We ordered 5 entrees and 4 appetizers. All to die for. I would only recommend this place if you can get a good server.",

So instead we decide to have a drink at the bar, but we are not bar people so we sat and a bartender came to us and greeted us very politely. It wasnt my first time so i knew what drinks we liked to order, but my girfriend decide to have a glass of wine instead, and the best experience in a restaurant are with wine, we were recomended some pasta dishes and what kind of wine goes well with the food, the bartender Paulo explained  every single pasta dish to us and what wine we should have so with the aracini and meatballs as appetizers, then the salmon cooked medium was just fantistic, my girfriend had the pesto pasta which is my favorite pasta, it was so well cooked and the pasta is al dente, btw they made their own pasta, of course a bottle of red wine,  Then desserts the buddino is like caramel puddin omg amazing and also the torta i couldnt belive it how much we ate.  Any ways we ate at the bar for the first time and just because the incredible service of this bartender from now we are gonna be regulars and of course sit at the bar.  Thank you North for this amazing experience and like Paolo told us last night \"let me give a tour for the culinary adventure of Italy\"  Food 10 stars, service 10 stars.",

The bar can get a little backed up, (totally understandable for a busy spot during peak hours) but other than that the service is outstanding.",

They have patio seating which is nice but it was so loud you are basically screaming at each other and your waiter.  I ordered the antipasto salad with grilled chicken and my son ordered spaghetti with meatballs. The food came out and the portions are small. I get they are lunch size but dang my son only got 1 tiny meatball. The salad I got was bland, barely any dressing on it so all you could taste was the mixed greens lettuce.   I'm sorry but for 3 people for lunch $100, for not great food is ridiculous. I will not be coming back here.",

It seems like this is a new restaurant and you feel it every day there, Maybe it's a first restaurant for that owner. It takes them long time to come and serve you, They don't know to answer questions like which of the sauces contain chicken or beef broth , Everybody say something different. It takes long time for food to come. Really dissap  I did contact in private message 5 days ago - No answer, no comment .",

This rating is based off our second try....a great dinner!  The restaurant has awesome indoor and outdoor spaces. It has super trendy decor and is cozy all at the same time.   We did not have reservations, so we had a 40 minute wait on a Friday night. We found seats at the bar and ordered drinks. I ordered a beer and my wife ordered a speciality cocktail. Both were served quickly.  Once seated, we were greeted by our server. She was very friendly and went over all the specials. We ordered the mussels to start with extra bread. The mussels were HUGE and the broth was really flavorful. The extra bread was needed.   For our mains, we ordered the bolognese and chicken parm. The chicken parm was good, but the pasta side that came with, was better. Really comforting. The bolognese was incredible. Something we will absolutely order again.   We ordered the affogatto for dessert. The gelato was creamy and sweet. The chocolate shavings were great with the hot espresso.  The meal was really good. We are looking forward to returning for another great meal.",

The hostess sat us right away, and was very nice. She even had a recommendation when asked about the food.  However, we sat there for 10 to 15 minutes while waiting for a glass of water or any server to even pay attention to us.  Server was nice enough, but poorly trained. Didn't know to get water right away. When the food came (pizza and arancini) I had to flag down a server (5 minutes of waving at workers - not exagerrating) just to get a plate. My wife wanted some bread with her pasta. I noticed that all the other tables had bread, so I asked my server how much a plate of bread cost. He responded it was free and asked if we wanted some.   The food was decent, but nothing special. I ordered the eggplant pizza (special) and arancini.  Wife got seafood maladine (pasta). Pizza tasted okay, but all of tthe toppings came off every slice in the first small bite, which means I mostly ate crunchy bread with tomato sauce residue.  The arancini was awesome.  The arancini was awesome.  (I wrote this twice on purpose. Pay attention.)  Wife's pasta with squid ink was mostly tasteless.  I put my nose into the dish and couldn't even smell any seafood.    We thought about dessert, but the entire meal felt like a failed first date, where nothing is really wrong, but it's not right either.  You just don't feel any chemistry. We decided to  quit while we weren't completely regretful. We left.   In summary: Get the arancini appetizer!!! Then leave.",

I've been there twice and both times had a very specially prepared meal. For brunch I ordered the French Toast.  It was THE BEST and came with an asst. of berries. Others ordered short ribs with eggs, and equally great menu  choices., including homemade pastas.  For lunch I ordered mussels and a glass of Pinot Grigio. They brought over  2 tastings for me to choose from. The wine came in a small carafe and the manager poured  a few times.  The prices are so reasonable yet you are treated as though you are ordering a $150 meal. The manager (Brian Lee) could not have been more attentive both times. The decor is clean and lovely. The tables are spaced apart. Give yourself a treat !!!!!!!!!",

I finally got up to let the hostess know we had not been helped. Our server Tyler came over and apologized and quickly took care of us. The manager cane over and apologized as well as sent over 3 apps. The zucca chips were mind blowing, great truffle bread and a huge charcuterie board. Our main courses were amazing ( we had the short rib entree and the bologenais). The service that we got after our initial issue was fabulous and they truly made it right. We will definitely be back to check out their happy hour and enjoy another dinner sometime soon. Only reason for 4 stars was the wait time once we were seated.

He takes care of us as if we are family and recommend nice dishes that we always love. My favorite entree is the squid ink mafaldine that consist of pasta made with black squid ink and seafood. Just delicious ! Today for a change I had the calamari with arugula and I was once again not disappointed at all. Thank you Amos for the nice recommendation. Will be back again soon !",

The calamari was tender and interesting in a lemon vinaigrette. Our waiter Leonard was cheerful and provided excellent customer service.",

Food is exceptional (I recommend the short rib radiatori), drinks are fantastic (apple bourbon sour) & the service was even better. Tacey and Palo at the bar were the best part of our experience, as incredible as the food and drinks were, and cannot wait to come back.",

It was busy and a little backed up but regardless, they made sure we got the best experience and it's all thanks to their manager Gabriel. He game in to check on us multiple times and I just am out of words. LOVED it, will definitely come back again.",

I'd first like to say I'm an occasional customer at this restaurant and it's a little disappointing that when I get there that the options were limited to a three course menu. That's not a bad idea but don't take away your ENTIRE menu! It's not what we came for. That's a little ridiculous you know? To top it all off all I hear is this guy in the kitchen yelling screaming and cursing the entire night and it's on Valentine's Day! Nobody wants to hear that and it was very off putting. The only reason why I didn't put one star is because I do like this place and the food was good.",
