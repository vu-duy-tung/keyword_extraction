I am Korean and I've had a lot of great bibimbap so I decided to try their version of bibimbap.  It was delicious!!  It was definitely different from traditional Korean bibimbap but the taste was excellent in a different way.  My husband tried their Wellington beef burger and he said it was very filling and satisfying.  This place is a must try!",

Received crazy delicious but not sure what they are \"chips and salsa.\" The salsa is super fresh and the chips are like home made spicy-ish triangular shaped. Sooo good! Went traditional with the BAM breakfast - pancakes, potatoes, bacon, and egg. Pancakes are fluffy and crispy golden brown. Huge offering of potatoes and eggs. Bacon is perfectly cooked! We'd highly recommend Served. They serve breakfast/brunch and lunch all day!",

I also enjoy the cinnamon chips with the pudding dip they give to you.

What a nice little brunch spot! we went on a Sunday morning around 10am and was seated immediately - not having to wait is always an added plus! We both had a Mimosa and enjoyed the breakfast items we ordered. The ambiance is pleasant and the overall dining experience was made better as we were greeted by surprise and \"SERVED\" by a friend of ours that I didn't know recently started working there. If you ever come to eat at Served, look for a fine young woman with sleeves tattoos on her left arm and a big beautiful smile - that's our friend Jean and she'll take good care of you!",

The wait on food was horrendous.   We got the berry French toast.  It was super delicious, but just DRENCHED in that berry syrup, which made it soggy from the get-go.  The Ono wings were my fave.  They had good flavors, just wish there were more sauce on them or on the side (waitress was too busy, so we couldn't ask for more sauce).  The burger with the mushrooms... do not get it. They were the greasiest burger ever.  My fiance and I wanted to split the burger, I see what the chef was trying to do, he wanted to do us a favor and split it for us in the kitchen, but he didn't have to add more oil or grease or whatever it was then put it back on the grill insides down.  So when that happened, it dried out the meat and made everything else inedible.   And they didn't have bottled water... the girl told me, \"our water is filtered though.\"  Ok, thanks... I'd hope so.",

The Green Eggs and Spam was delicious.  A green Thai butter made the eggs green and it was served with a garlic vinegar that I wanted to pour over everything.  The Tocilog (Filipino breakfast) was service with tocino (sweet grilled cured pork).  It was porky fatty, tasty goodness served with garlic fried rice and eggs.

    "text": "This was BAD!  I took my son for brunch one day. We started off with the tempura fried cheese appetizer followed by soft shell crab Benedict for me and shirt rib Benedict for my son. We each had a glass of fresh watermelon juice. The fried cheese took forever to come out of the kitchen. In that time we drank our watermelon juice. It was pricy but good. It was a warm day so I ordered another along with water. I kid you not we asked the server at least 5 times over a period of 15 mins about our drinks. Our appetizer finally came out and still no drinks after asking again. Then the entrees arrived and finally we were given our drinks. Thank goodness we had a drink to wash down the food. It was t very good at all. The short rib Benedict was a big messy slop of a plate. There were so many mushrooms on it that you couldn't distinguish the mushrooms from the meat. Everyone knows that mushrooms hold a lot of water. Apparently everyone except this chef. The entire plate was soaked. The dish was completely inedible.  My sons soft shell crab Benny looked good. One bite and we both spit it out. The crab was not fresh. It had a very fishy taste and did not smell right. The waiter never returned to check on us to even see how it was. At this point we were just done and pushed our plates away. The chef began making rounds and arrived at our table. He clearly saw we did not touch our food. He asked if something was wrong to which I told him the food just wasn't good. He looked at me almost with an offended look and said what's not good about it. We weren't even going to say anything and just chalk it up to trying some new food at a new restaurant. However the chefs demeanor compelled me to tell him what a sloppy mess my item was. I then told him he needed to check his crab before someone gets sick because it was bad. He never offered to redo the food or offer something in its place. He said well I'm sorry you feel that way and walked away. The worst part was getting stuck with a bill of almost $70 for brunch and walking out of there still hungry. We will NEVER be back.",

    "text": "Our first visit was for brunch and turned out to be a disaster. Should have trusted our instincts upon first entering this small restaurant in Memorial Day. There was a sense of disarray that made us think that the place wasn't prepared for a Monday holiday. But it wasn't crowded, so we decided to stay the course. There was a group of 9 people seated just before us. So we quickly made our decision and ordered so that we wouldn't have to wait for a large table to be served. Our waiter was attentive and and took our order well before the large group. Forty minutes passed, and our waiter returned to confess that our order got misplaced and that he just escalated our order. He assured us our order was now a top kitchen priority. We weren't in a hurry so decided to wait. Another 15-20 minutes passed and the chef emerged from the kitchen with a two plate order. Unfortunately it was not our order, but that if another party of two that was seated well after us. At this point, we were turned off to the whole experience and decided to leave. Not sure if this was simply an anomaly or not, but with the plethora of other brunch and breakfast choices in Henderson, we doubt that it worth another attempt at this place. Another negative worth noting is that Served currently has only a \"B\" rating from the County Health Department. As a final note, we commend our waiter for at least being forthright and letting us know about the problem. Unfortunately the kitchen didn't seem to share his interest in our experience.",

Chef stopped by to ensure we loved our food, nice touch. And yes, we loved it!! Well it's 2 years later & we're so happy that Served has not only survived, but it's even better if that's possible. Service is outstanding, food is a welcome breath of fresh air. I love that they're now open for dinner & the menu has expanded. I can't say enough good things about Served, from the quality of their food, to the preparation, presentation, taste & unique menu. Although my husband's tastes are fairly simple, he truly enjoys their food.  We will return before going back to Chicago!!",

The loaded potato nuggets were insane, and they even topped them with an amazing cheese sauce (it seriously was so good!) I got the BiBimBap which was so good, just the right amount of spice and a perfectly cooked egg! My husband got the Lomo. Which was also incredible and cooked to perfection.

Bright sunny minimal decor location with friendly hostess/server there to greet you.  Sit down, order the Mango Ice Tea (husband and daughter thought it was great) and peruse the creative, inspired menu.  I chose the BLAT and was SO happy I did.  Lots of savory sweet bacon, fresh veges and grilled to perfection. Sweet potato fries that were light and a little crunchy accompanied.  Food was served hot and quickly.   Matt the owner/chef came out to say hello and thank us for our business.  We told him we would be back to try other tempting items on the menu. Highly recommend Served!!",

    "text": "So once again, thank you yelp for showing all the amazing food photos of a place and making me \"have\" to go there... oh and for already knowing what I want to order before I even step foot inside. The hubs and I  (Ok, ... I) tried this place out on a Saturday and I was excited to try the long silong based solely on yelp photos and reviews. The space was really small, though tidy, and there were only 2 other tables occupied. I have to agree with some of the reviews on service, was a quite a wait for drinks, especially when there was no one there. Our server was friendly, though, and have recommendations when asked, so  we ordered and waited. And waited. And waited. When we figured that surely the food would arrive any minute we received chips with paprika and salsa. Hubs loved them, unfortunately they were way too spicy for me. When our food finally arrived, he had three barbacoa Benedict, it was beautiful and the portions were huge. Unfortunately for me the garlic rice was way, way, way too garlicky for my taste (and I have always believed there is no such thing as too much garlic!). The sausage was AMAZING though. It came with a side of vinegar and the other server I pulled aside (couldn't find ours, in fact she never checked on us at all) when I asked what it was for said she drowns her sausage in it, and what a great tip, wad delicious.  All in all it was a nice place, but I had to leave 3 stars because of the lack of attention by service (ours at least), and the fact that I could only eat 1/2 of my meal. I couldn't even say anything about the rice because the first time we saw our server after ordering was after my husband had already finished, there was no point. I will probably give this place another try and will ammend my review if it changes, and I hope it does because this spot has potential and I love small businesses.",

I mentioned to him that the food was spot on, and expressed surprise about the portion size and super reasonable pricing.  His response was that he wanted his patrons to feel like they got great food and an even better deal.  With the variety and quality of the overall menu I see this place as a can't miss for the next time i come out that way.  Give this place a chance if you have an appetite for something different...

The waitress was nice and gave us 2 chips & salsas. Not sure what they put on their chips, but they were yummy and fresh! I ordered the Korean galbi flank steak tacos, which came with rice and beans. The tacos were delicious, the meat was well marinated and the kimchi slaw added the perfect touch! The rice that it came with was a bit crunchy for my liking, but had a good spicy kick to it.  My boyfriend ordered the miso pork belly burger. It was huge! The pork belly was an added touch to an already good burger.  This is defiantly a place I would visit again!",

The green eggs and spam was a party for my palate. Salty, spicy, sweet, sour--a perfect balance of flavors. I think about this dish CONSTANTLY. The soft shell crab eggs benedict was also excellent. The miso hollandaise was a surprisingly subtle sauce. I appreciated that it was different from the standard hollandaise but wished it had a more distinctive miso flavor.   Service was fine, except our server was unclear on gluten free items on the menu (we had a gluten allergy in our group). I was surprised to see the chef/owner making rounds to check on each table-- it definitely elevated our dining experience.    While we were there, a couple walked in and the hostess asked if they wanted \"the same table as yesterday.\" If only I hadn't discovered this place on my last morning in Las Vegas, because I too would have dined here multiple days!

The GR&S matched the namesake served over a garlic rice with a side of delicious ginger slaw and a vinegar sauce.  The garlic rice was simple tasty, very good. Wasn't sure what to do with the vinegar. Only issue was the eggs were unevenly cooked and not to they way I ordered them.  I ordered over medium and one came out over hard and one over easy. The KFC was topped with amazing Kim Chi and served with a side of crispy seasoned potatoes and skin that were very good.  I would recommend this restaurant to any self proclaimed foody or anyone looking to try food off the normal beaten path.",

Thank you.  Best part however was the uniquely expressive fusion of traditional breakfast favorites with Asian influence. Great selection of food types, all familiar, but with something a little extra. Perfect balance of flavor.  It was like seeing a beloved family member after they returned from a long visit overseas, but they have returned with exciting new secrets.",

Location is a little awkward but that means you can get a parking spot easily. Don't miss this gem. I wish they would open one in my town Scottsdale.if I could rate 10 stars for food then I would.",

It is a very small hole in the wall place with probably about 12 tables. We got seated fast however, sat at the table for over 15-20 minutes before someone came over to get us drinks. Workers just kept passing the table and seemed they had no idea what was going on. After we got our drinks we were told a server will be by to take our food order. Add on another 15 minutes before someone came back. The menu has very interesting options. The food was the best part of our experience. The food was delicious and very tasty. The presentation also was appealing to the eyes. Overall the customer service was horrible. Not once did they offer a water refill. A server never checked in on us.  This place has potential if they can get the team on board.",

One order was the tripple decker turkey sandwich, i figured what can go wrong with a turkey sandwich? I have never seen a turkey sandwich made out of a canned turrkey meat. The other one was a fish taco. The fish was taken from a frozen breaded fish and fried. The fried rice wad soooo oily with no taste at all. NTC",

We finally discovered that Served offers a military/veteran's discount of 50% their meal!  Wow - amazing!  So, we show up for a family meal (with 4 veterans/military, 2 other adults and 2 children) and our served says that since there are so many of us we are simply going to get a 20% discount for the table - talk about a bait and switch...not a happy customer...  However, we really loved their food so after a few months we felt like it was time to give them another chance... So that was today for our family of four.  We showed up and were told it would be about a 25 minute wait - not bad and worth it.  After about 45 minutes we are told the next table is ours - longer wait then expected but still time to give them another shot... So we walk in to be seated when the next table opens up, we were then informed that people with a reservation just showed up so now that table is theirs, but the NEXT one will be ours...SERIOUSLY!!!!  We just wasted almost of an hour of our day for no food!  Suffice to say - we left so as not to waste any more time in our day.  We will definitely NEVER be returning now.  This is not how any business should operate!",

We ordered the Longsilog, Crispy Baked Berry French Toast, the Huevos Rancheros, the Softshell Crab Benedict, mimosas and coffee. Every dish was absolute perfection, and the mimosas were very light and bubbly. There were 2 Filipinos and a Mexican in the group and we were all very happy!! The one thing I was unhappy about was the decaf coffee. My decaf tasted bitter, so much that I asked for another cup. Unfortunately, it was still bitter, so I couldn't enjoy a cup of decaf. I tasted my friend's regular cup of coffee and hers was not bitter, so it must be in the decaf coffee they chose. Please fix the decaf blend, because then it would have been the best breakfast ever!! However, even with the coffee flop, I honestly can't wait to come here again! If you're deciding between Kitchen Table and Served, definitely choose Served- you will not be disappointed!",

I even had leftovers the portion was generous. My dining mate had pineapple fried rice which was loaded with raisins and nuts and she loved it, too. Service was friendly and helpful since it was our first visit. Cassandra was energetic and handled several customers without missing a beat.

Came here with a colleague with for lunch during a business trip to Vegas and me being me had to Yelp the best restaurants for lunch before picking a spot. Served came up top so we went with that.   Upon entering the restaurant it was shocking. Place was absolutely deserted, literally no one. Shocked we still decided to sit down and give the spot a try. A very nice hostess came over and took out order and dropped off some spiced chips and salsa. From the chips and salsa both my colleague and I both knew this was going to be a special lunch. We both couldn't stop eating the chips they were that delicious.   For entree my colleague ordered their club (against my advise) with sweet potato fries and I went with their BBQ Bacon Burger with potato wedges. His club was good but nothing special but my Burger my god was that delicious. Perfectly cooked, quality bacon, and on a solid bun.   Overall, this has easily beat Midtown Eats in Reno for me (since they removed the Bison Burger off their menu) for my favorite burger. Delicious. Will be back!!",

    "text": "My meal at Served was a wonderful experience, and I would return in a heartbeat!   I ordered the Korean Cheese Steak because the kimchi and Korean marinade seemed like it would make a wonderful combination- and it did. They do not skimp on the grilled onions, meat, or cheese sauce, come hungry! My side was the macaroni salad made just how I like it- light on the mayonnaise, and the only sweetness came from the fresh and crunchy chopped carrots and celery. I was very impressed. On the side I had a refreshing Mango Iced Tea. It felt like I was eating a Korean-American barbecue meal.   Our server was kind and helpful. We met the chef/owner Matt, who was the same way.   My family and I were lucky to stumble across this gem of a restaurant. The menu is varied and unique- it featured a selection of Asian Fusion I had not seen before. In truth, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but given the chance, the food and staff will impress you. I look forward to coming back and continuing to support Matt's business!",

    "text": "Gonna try out a new tl;dr thing today.  PROS:  (+) solid treatment of proteins overall (+) French toast is god tier (+) delicious happy hour items (some of which seem to be lifted directly from regular menu and heavily discounted) [HH: 2-6pm daily]  CONS:  (-) inconsistent service on my two visits (-) inconsistent potatoes (-) some issues with \"charring\"  =======  Served is the most recent arrival of a breakfast/lunch renaissance in Henderson, with three local-centric restaurants offering food that's a step up from diners. Daunted somewhat by the variety of reportedly delicious dishes, I finally found a nice opportunity for a lunchtime meal with a trio of diners, including a friend visiting town and her colleague. I also made a follow-up solo visit during happy hour.  The menu looks pricey compared to the other \"brenaissance\" spots, but all of the entrees in our group meal fell in the $11-$20 range, which accounts for most of the breakfast/lunch menu here. These dishes are big enough to share, and we ended up with copious amounts of leftovers.  But first, we had to wait. It took over 35 minutes for us to get the order, and the kitchen gave no recompense or explanation. They brought out cinnamon sugar chips with a Nutella dip, but even that took 20 minutes and seems to be a free snack for all diners according to other reviews. I truly hope that this was an isolated incident.  When we finally received our food, our server announced the wrong order as the benedict. I barely caught it before first bites. I later learned that our server was brand-new, but that's still no excuse for that or for her relative inattention throughout the meal.  Baked Berry French Toast ($16): I was almost ready to forgive everything after the first bite. The bread-pudding-as-French-toast was awesome. The juicy berries, crunchy sliced almonds, sweet bourbon glaze, and even the rich whipped cream were all perfect complements. I could've devoured the whole thing without flavor fatigue and been satisfied for breakfast.  Roast Pork Belly Benedict ($15): all the pork was tender enough and pretty tasty. The julienne chilis brought heat in some bites. The poached eggs were a little overdone, with at most half of the yolk staying in glorious golden liquid form. Unfortunately, half of the potato hash was overdone if not \"charred.\" The seasoning was fine, but there has to be consistency/evenness in the cooking. Also, I just realized that we'd intended to order the \"Crispy\" Pork Belly Benedict, so that's another newbie server issue. Nobody else noticed, so I guess it's not-much harm, not-much foul?  Lomo Saltado ($18): ...not much consistency between plates either. The potatoes on this dish were actually a little undersalted. The dish was good otherwise, with the beef containing the salt, the plantains providing the expected sweet and tender accompaniment, and both tomatoes and red onions turning out properly cooked.  =======  Eyeing the 2-6pm daily happy hour menu, which prominently features tacos ($3 each, 6 options), sliders, ($5 each, 7 options), and the loaded nuggets appetizer ($5 a plate, 2 options), I came back a couple of days later to give them another shot. I got an experienced server who walked me through several of his favorite menu items. I went for a varied, big order, and I stopwatched the arrival of the tacos at about 15 minutes post-order; the sliders and nuggets followed within 10 minutes after that.  Each taco comes on two semi-crispy 4-inch tortillas, and none which I ordered were spicy. The Birria was a delicious marinated beef taco that tastes like something traditionally Mexican. The Fish isn't the fluffiest, but it's crispy and goes well with the provided lime wedge. The Shrimp Tempura was easily my favorite, with plump shrimp popping in my mouth with every bite. Its mother would be so proud.  I went for the sliders corresponding to the priciest burgers, the Umami and the Wellington. They're maybe 3 inches in diameter at best, and they come skewered. The only notable missing ingredient compared to the full-size version is eggs, but they were both still delicious, albeit a little salty. The Umami had a nice monkfish liver and I loved the yuzu aioli, but the nori was too clunky and hard to bite through. Shredded nori would've been better. As for the Wellington, I loved the cheese and crispy potato strings, and aside from one or two burnt mushroom bits, I can see why this is my server's favorite burger.  Finally, I eyed the Longanisa Nuggets and realized that I had to get a to-go box. The plate is massive. The egg was also omitted here, but it was pretty good and very filling. I loved the cheese, salsa, avocado, and sweet sausage. The potatoes were more consistent this time, but they're not excellent still.  Served turned out to be a pretty good place when considering the best parts of two visits. I'll definitely return for HH and I'll probably give more of their regular menu a try, including their on-again dinner.",

The burger was 12 oz and there had to have been 6 oz of beautiful pork belly sitting atop it.  The white rice was not really good. The garlic taste was owed powering. Didn't care because I knew I wouldn't finish the burger anyway. Everyone that dined there thought it was terrific. Make sure you try anyone of their burgers. Huge hits out of the park.",

From the hostess, to our waitress, to the chef, EVERYTHING was amazing. I was there with family and friends for a bachelorette party. Saturday, we originally planned to go to another restaurant in the same shopping center but it was closed. Boo. Never have I ever been so happy for a restaurant to be closed because we stumbled upon SERVED.  It was so good that we ended up going again on Sunday! Our waitress, Cassandra I believe, was a gem. She was super attentive yet not OVER bearing. Her service was perfect; it felt genuine. Not \"I want to make sure I get a good tip, so I'll be nice & cool\". She was great. And then Chef Matt came to our table to check on us. We obviously praised him. I got the Bam Slam. DROOL. First off, I only eat chocolate chip pancakes but I had a good feeling about their blueberry pancakes so I got it. It did not disappoint! I got the same thing both days. The mimosa's were SO GOOD. The peach & guava were divine.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I am for sure making my way back there! Hopefully Chef Matt brings his talents to NYC because I need this in my life. Keep being amazing Staff at Served!!!",

We had to ask 3 times for mayo for her sandwich. I took off another star because they have daily specials listed on the website. Tuesday Is listed as buy one get one free sandwiches. I asked before ordering and the waiter babbled something about being shorthanded and not honoring the specials I gave it a week and it's still on their website. That indicates that they are sloppy running their website or are deliberately deceptive.",

    "text": "This is a small, yet very chic restaurant. The decor is simple, but I liked it. Decor wise, I would suggest a 3rd curtain covering the opening near the back, it'll hide the boxes and other things patrons might not want to see. The restaurant is in a office park like location and is in the back off of horizon ridge  6 of us came in today for brunch, due to the small size of the restaurant we waited a few minutes for parties to leave so 2 tables could be put together. It looks like you can also make reservations.   It started to get quite busy after we were seated, which led to a long wait to get drink orders in, then a long wait to get the food order in. The servers were doing their best to handle the crowd, but they just couldn't keep up. We ordered the food and then waited a very long time while munching on cinnamon chips with chocolate nutella dip - tasty but definitely not good for you!  Our party ordered the French toast (We wanted this as a appetizer, but it didn't work out that way) it was dense, crunchy, sweet, and pretty good. There were 8 thick pieces (about a 4th of a piece of white bread, but maybe 2.5 slices thick), covered in syrup, berries, and completely melted whipped cream.   3 of us ordered corned beef hash bread pudding Benedict's  (2 of us got them, mine was given away to a different table), one pork belly Benedict, 2 of their version of grand slams. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, but thought the bread pudding on the hash was overcooked. I was able to try a bite, I loved the hash part. All people ordering Benedict's thought the poached eggs were overcooked.   The grand slam people liked their very crispy bacon (some may say overcooked) and pancakes. Since I never received my food I polished off the French toast instead. The waitress apologized profusely for the oversight, she had the chef cook me up an order and I asked for it in a to go container - it'll make a nice dinner. She comped my meal and gave the table a 10% discount because half the table received their food about 10-15 minutes before the other half. It was a nice gesture, especially since the meals range from about 12 - 25 per plate.   I appreciated the waitress very much, she was swamped so I don't blame her for the food incident or the fact that some drink glasses didn't get refilled. This is when you look at management and wonder why they can't staff properly for Sunday brunch when a good majority of people go out.   I think this can be a good place, the chef might want to undercook a bit as I feel plates may be waiting under heat lamps, and they definitely go onto hot plates which continues to cook things. The waitress says weekdays are less busy, so if you're interested try at that time.   Service 4/5 - they are busy and I could tell trying their best to keep up.  Food 3/5 - beautiful presentation, just a bit overcooked which can give an off flavor, bread pudding was not well received   Average 3.5 - but I'll give them a 4 for effort.",

The last time I brunched here, the complimentary appetizer while we waited for our entrees was cinnamon pita chips with a banana Nutella dip. Oh man! It was an extremely tasty combo.

This place is a little local spot which made the prices a little unexpected.  - Soft Shell Crab Benedict $20 ... there was such a small amount of crab that I could not understand the $20 for basically an eggs benedict with no meat. The sliced potatoes were the best part of that dish.  - Apple Pie Tempura Pancakes $12. The portion size was large and it came with tempura fried slices of green apples. The pancakes themselves were good but the sauce from the green apples was pretty sour. We ate about a third because we were hungry but didn't take the left overs.  - Fried Chicken and Cornbread French Toast $12. It's possible the menu said how many pieces of chicken and french toast but it was under entree so expected and entree. What came out was three regular to small size chicken wings and three fast food sized French toast sticks. This should not be served as a meal but rather as an appetizer... maybe. I was the only person that ate from this plate and was sick to my stomach most of the day after the meal.   - Watermelon juice was the juice of the day and we left two cups of it untouched because, well, it just wasn't good. I think we paid $13 for a small and a large juice.  The chef did come out after our meal and ask how everything was... I didn't say anything about the food to him because I knew there would be nothing else on the menu I would want to try and I was not feeling well by that point. Spending $75 on a meal (after the drinks and tip) and feeling slightly nauseous and still hungry after, will leave anyone writing a mediocre review.  I chalk this place up as \"not for us\" and keep it moving.",

The staff is nice and I really liked how the chef came out and talked to some of the customers. To me, that means a lot for a chef to come out of the Kitchen.   The pricing ranges from $9 to about $25. The food is amazing here. I ordered the burger with pork belly on top with potatoes and it was ONO! I had to cut it in half or it was too big for me to eat. The beef patty was very juicy and tender and everything just went well together.

Never got those. However, I give it so many stars because the food was AWESOME. Perhaps a little overpriced ($25 for a Benedict is a little much, even if it is short rib). That being said, I'm always willing to pay more for food if it's good, and it was. I went back and forth between giving it 3 or 4 stars because the service really was not good.

Fifth, I ended up in the bathroom. Sadly to say, try another place for exquisite food. I hate to do bad reviews on small businesses....However, something has to change read and pay attention to the YELP reviews.

The restaurant is quaint and rather small which is totally fine as it seems more inviting this way.  I happened to go on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all which rocked.  The service was great and waitress was very attentive and kind.  She told us a bit about the place and the chef and how he makes just about everything from scratch which was pretty awesome to hear. Now to the food.  It rocked!  I got the miso pork burger which I assumed to be a burger made of pork but it turns out the miso pork came on top of the burger which made it stand about 66 inches or so tall.  Literally every bite oozed juice, that's how well it was made.  It was outstanding and the mac salad on the side was quite refreshing and a good accompaniment.  The rest of my group got the tempura shrimp po'boy, the banh mi, and the berry french toast, all of which, according to them, were fantastic as well.    I don't know if it's because it wasn't that busy or because this is just how he is but the chef came over and welcomed us after our meal and thanked us for eating there, asked us how we enjoyed it, and if we needed anything else which was an extremely kind gesture.  I am definitely going back here and want to try everything on the menu!",

We tried the ono chicken wing lunch plate (wings were cooked perfectly and had a light crunch, the rice had a tasty sweet soy(ish) sauce drizzled on it, and the mac salad was tasty and didn't have a heavy mayo presence), the shrimp tempura tacos (tasty \"yum yum\" sauce, shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly), and the bam slam breakfast (awesome bacon).  Service was really friendly and attentive. The chef/owner even stopped by our table to make sure that we were happy.  We'll definitely be back to try other items - they have a really diverse menu. So glad we tried it!",

I had the tempura apple pancakes and it had a perfect balance of tartness to sweetness, plus the crunchy tempura texture with the softness of the cooked apples and pancakes.... Literally my mouth is watering just thinking about it again.   All of their menu options sound delicious and my sister's mushroom Benedict was also amazing. It is definitely pricier than most of the brunch spots I've been to but at least you leave with your tummy happy and your palette surprised and satisfied. Definitely recommend",

At first sight the menu looks quite random, and because I didn't even look at the menu or photos before coming in I had no idea what to expect.   It is a 3.5 stars spot for brunch, but  I gave them 4 stars and that is why:  * Service- professional, quick, to the point and very helpful. The hostess and waitress both were friendly and smiley just at the right amount. At one pitch not the chef/owner (not sure what was his position) came to check up on me- that was definitely a cool thing.   * Food- it was good! Not the best Salmon Eggs Benedict, but still pretty tasty.  The crispy potatoes were amazing!   * Presentation- The dish looked beautiful! The use very unique plates and presentation looks beautiful. One thing I didn't like as much were the petals. I Just don't think there is a need for that.   * Yelp Coupon- that was a nice surprise to get 15% off just to check in. I didn't even realize that after I already checked in.   Couple of things that I DIDN'T appreciate:  * Ambient- definitely lacking something and I would even say boring.   * Odor- unfortunately I must say that the place had a funky smell when you walk inside. Luckily for me I don't care much, and usually I'll get used to it pretty fast but there was definitely a funky smell that I didn't appreciate when I walked in.   * Price- I think it's a little bit overpriced. But I guess you have to pay for that presentation!",

Chef Matt came by and hubby needed some extra rice for his meal (you know how us Filipinos are)...other than that, we let him know everything was delicious.

The good things- place had a simple and clean look to it and we were seated and attended to quickly.  Cassandra was our server and she was very pleasant and did everything a server should do.  The not so good- we ordered the Pupusas breakfast and the tempura shrimp tacos. First the Pupusa dish.. not sure why it's called that. i get that maybe they are going for some sort of fusion but that was something else. they were basically flavorless  fried cheese balls not really sure what the batter was made of but didn't taste like corn. The only thing on the plate  that was decent was the slaw AKA curtido and the plantains.. the meat was mediocre a little dried out.  The shrimp tacos... the beans were good. as far as the rest of the plate, complete disappointment. Red and green food coloring??? The shrimp were far too over battered and were way too greasy. Too much yum yum sauce didn't add any yum to the grease. And for the worst thing of all the reheated stale grease soaked gummy food colored green rice with a hint of I think was jalapeno flavor. Any chef should be embarrassed to serve. I spit it out. I'm not sure how this place has so many great reviews maybe we both ordered the wrong thing or maybe they had a lot of left overs from the week they were hoping to reheat and get rid of or all these reviews were made by people who mostly eat fast food and just don't know any better. But this was not a $50 lunch.  They may be \" high quality ingredients\" but if you serve them reheated, days old, or prepare incorrectly they can no longer be considered high quality and over priced. We are not demanding-our-money-back kind of people so we paid and left. We will definitely not return.",

The beans were cold when served.  So, I told the waitress that it was cold.  She apologized and sometime later I received a ramekin with warm beans.  As for the taste, the rice and beans were mediocre while the tacos were somewhat flavorful.  I felt that the restaurant was very stingy in the portions of food that I ordered.

    "text": "Service: 5/5 Pros: Servers are prompt and food is delivered as it comes out of kitchen rather than stay under hot lamp awaiting other orders. Head chef comes out after all food is delivered to make sure food is to your liking. Cons: We had times where food was not cooked to liking (for example: eggs were ordered over easy but was overcooked as yolk was no longer runny. Head chef promptly makes new one).   Food: 5/5 Pros: Big portions, food seasoned well.  Huge variety of choices on menu. Menu changes depending on season and popularity. You can ask for former dishes not on menu on future dinings.   Inside/Decor: 4.5/5 Pros: Great lighting with many large windows allowing to see outside. Decor plain, yet simple and elegant. Cons: Place is small so it can only seat a small amount of guests. Reservations are available for larger parties. One bathroom for men and women. Bathroom clean, but needs renovation as a couple times being there toilet does not flush well.",

    "text": "The restaurant is able to make tasty Asian-American fusion foods. We were looking for a brunch place and found this on a whim. This is a tiny restaurant that has a homey feel to it.   Upon sitting, they give you \"tortilla chips\" dusted with cinnamon sugar with a Nutella dip. This may sound sweet, but it is not that sweet and the Nutella was whipped and very light. I had the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict. It was topped with a Thai Chili Hollandaise sauce that was slightly too spicy for my liking, but it was smooth and creamy and paired perfectly with the marinated roasted pork. There was a little too much fat on the pork belly that was not rendered enough, but the overall flavors of the pork was delicious. It paired perfectly with the sauce, where the sauce accentuated the natural flavors of the roasted pork. This was served on a bed of toasted sourdough crostini, where it soaked up the flavors of the pork and the sauce. There was not too much bread, which was good as it did not overpower the pork  My boyfriend got the Longsilog, which is a traditional Filipino breakfast of fried garlic rice, eggs, and longanisa, which is a Filipino breakfast sausage. They make their own longanisa and it was cooked to perfection, with a crispy outer shell, giving it that classic \"popping\" sound when the casing breaks. The sausage itself was slightly sweet and salty, though not overpoweringly sweet. It was accompanied with their own seasoned vinegar, which is a classic pairing with this type of sausage. The vinegar was not as strong as expected, which was great because a lot of times a strong vinegar can mask the flavors of the longanisa. In this case, the longanisa was the star and paired well with the garlic fried rice and eggs.",

(Instead of older famous chefs mailing it in). Chef Matt Meyer  is taking the best from various food cultures and putting his own spin on things. Kinda like Bruce Lee did with martial arts.  Your meal starts with house made chips and salsa. Real good. From there feel free to explore the ever changing menu and discover your own favs!   If your a fan of eggs benny then you'll love the hollandaise sauce. Fusian? Try east meets west meets south.

It was slow when we came in since they just opened but regardless the service was great. They started us off with cinnamon chips with banana nut Nutella dip. They also have bottomless mimosas!! Now my boyfriend is very picky and hate trying new places but he really liked his burger (even though it was 9am) the meat was juicy and on top of that had bulgogi which by the way was very flavorful.

When we walked in we were immediately greeted and seated promptly. Very clean workplace and friendly workers.   We didn't know what to order because the menu was so big and so many selections available. So we asked the server, Carlo for his suggestions and he gave us his favorite from each section of the menu. And I'm glad we went with his recommendations! He knew what he was taking about. The food expected expectations. We ordered the Crispy Banana Nutella French Toast and it was sooooo good! Must try! We also order the Prime Rib Benedict. I love Benedict's so this one was gonna have to WOW me.. and it did just that. Lastly, my girlfriend ordered the Miso Pork Belly Burger.. which was a huge portion btw!!! It came with Loaded Truffle Parmesan Potatoes (Loaded Park Nuggets) as they call them. Ridiculously good!!!  Overall, we'd come back.. the chef behind the menu is obviously talented. The staff is friendly and attentive. Thank you Carlo for this experience!!!",

Both were pretty good but the only thing is that the tocino meat was hard to cut. However their eggs were perfectly cooked the way I like it (over medium) and their garlic fried rice was delicious.  The banana foster pancake was scrumptious and I like it that it also had the side Turon or banana fritter. Service was pretty good and the bathroom was clean. This is a small restaurant located in a small business area. Overall, we had a good experience dining here and will definitely return.",

They give you cinnamon chips to start.  Had the huevos rancheros and the tempura pancakes.  We even got to try the berry french toast!  Out of everything the French Toast was the best but everything tasted good.  It is on the pricey side but the portion side is generous. Will have to stop by for lunch sometime to try that menu!",

I do remember that Debbie's selection, the scotch egg was unique and tasty.  We also got the fresh juice of the day.  I don't remember what it is, but I do remember that it was bland.  Will I give this place another try?  Have not yet decide...",

Came here for late breakfast. The waitress (blond lady) was very nice and cheerful. She suggested me to get roasted pork belly benedict. Korean boiled eggs caught my eye so I decided to try that also. She said Dr. Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he's here and it's delicious. My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa.   Roasted pork belly benidict... Delicious! Poached eggs were perfectly made. Roasted pork belly was exactly like \"Char siu\" you would get in some Ramen shop. Very fatty and melt in your mouths. I was expecting to get muffin type bread but the bread was like french baguette toasted very hard. I couldn't cut with the knife so I had to pick it up with my fingers and ate it.   Korean boiled eggs... When I saw \"Korean eggs\" on the menu, I thought of \"Korean sauna eggs\" which you would get in Korean spas (they roast eggs in hot sauna for hours) but completely different thing came out. It was exactly like \"Nitamago\" or \"Ajitama\" you would get in any nicer Ramen shop. Perfectly done sweet soy sauce flavored Nitamago. I loved it!  It was nice for the chef to come out and talk to every customer that was there. He was a very nice person. He explained me how to make perfect Nitamago (well, Korean boiled eggs) with vinegar and stuff. I don't know if he's a owner chef or head chef but I hope this place gets a lot of business!!",

    "text": "I took my Mom to breakfast at this hot new business yesterday morning and we had absolutely no regrets. It is located up off of Horizon Ridge Parkway in a nice new strip mall. It was pretty easy to find with ample parking.   The restaurant itself is a small intimate setting. The tables are simple and modern and each table has a small succulent plant as the centerpiece. We arrived around 9:30am and there weren't too many people so it was very comfortable. We were greeted by our lovely hostess/server who promptly sat us at a table by a window and provided drinks instantly. The menu is very diverse offering meals from Mexico to the Phillipines. I chose the Huevos Rancheros and Mom chose the Bam Slam.   When the breakfast arrived, it was hot and looked delicious. The Huevos Rancheros was served with three corn tortillas that were fried and sitting on a platter of Peruvian beans. Three eggs topped the tortillas and queso crema was the icing on this mountain of goodness. Along the sides of the dish was a layer of sweet, green salsa and then there was an inner layer of hot red salsa on the eggs and potatoes. The dish produced so many different flavors and textures. The Peruvian beans were a unique change for this dish as I have usually only had it with refried beans. The Bam Slam was huge and can easily feed two people. Eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast and Mom was very full by the time she was done. What I enjoyed most about this meal was the fact that Chef Matt came out and asked us how we liked our meals. He was very friendly and I appreciate when the chef wants to know your opinion. It tells me that he genuinely cares about the food he is creating and serving.   There were so many interesting and tasty looking dishes on the menu to sample which gives me every reason to return in order to taste more breakfasts dishes and then lunch. They aren't open yet for dinner but they are planning on it in the future. By the time we were finished, the restaurant was getting busy which I believe was attributed to the flavorful food being cooked.  I suggest that when you are out in Green Valley, you stop by to be SERVED at this quaint little gem!",

The initial thoughts were a very cozy, mom & pop spot with great decorum.  We were greeted by Cassandra as we walked in the door and took in the ambiance.  We ordered the Turkey Burger (add bacon) the crispy tacos, sweet potato fries, a Wailua Wheat and a Mimosa.  The drinks arrived promptly and the food shortly thereafter.  The turkey burger was immense!  The added bacon is a must have for anyone, and the side of crispy potato nuggets were amazing.  My Crispy tacos had just the right amount of sauce and slaw.  As for the sweet potato fries, huge portion, and absolutely delectable.  The Beer and Mimosas were spot on and Cassandra was ready for us when we needed more.  I'm extremely happy with our choice of brunch spots today.  Be advised, we came in on a Monday and were seated immediately.  I've heard weekends can get VERY busy, so be prepared!  All in all I'd have to give this place a 5/5.  Absolutely fantastic!",

    "text": "Served is a real Henderson gem.  I've been here twice now and both visits have featured food that was fabulous.  Both times I had the Ono Wings with rice because that dish is just delicious.  I am not really a wing woman, but I just love the seasoning they use, maybe soy?  I recommend this dish for yourself or to share if you're feeling generous.  My second visit was with the boyfriend for breakfast and I had the Longsilog (Filipino) breakfast, which was just like eating at my parents' house.  This dish features longanisa, garlic fried rice, and fried eggs, all of which are  regular features in Filipino households, or at least they are in ours, my aunts' and uncles', and cousins' kitchens.  Longanisa is a Filipino sausage that's on the sweeter side and is usually eaten with rice. Heck, most Filipino food is eaten with rice.  Although Served is not a Filipino restaurant per se, there is definitely a Filipino influence due to one of the chefs being married to a Filipina: he's a smart man.  I really loved this breakfast and of course I'm probably biased since it just brought back all the warm memories of home and Mom and Lola's cooking.    The staff here is very welcoming and attentive and the overall experiences I've had here just make me want to return again and again.  Next on my list to try are the longanisa tacos, the Mac and Cheese of the Day, and the Miso Pork Belly Burger.",

    "text": "This place was pretty ballin but pricy in my opinion. I went during brunch and it was kind of empty and secluded (not sure if that's always the case).  Service: We got served right away (probably because we were the only ones XD) The lady who served us was very nice and gave some great suggestions. She also filled our water frequently (very important to me!)  Food: I got the Asian BLAT which has pork belly. This sandwich was bomb! I could have eating it without the pork belly and it will still be bomb. Whatever dressing they used was delicious. The pork belly was really nicely marinated but fatty (I love it but if you don't like a giant junk of fat, maybe not). The problem for me was the pork belly was so big that I couldn't actually eat it in the sandwich. I took it out of the sandwich and cut it up and ate it in between sandwich bites. It came with potatoes which was good but I didn't really care for it. My friend got the green egg and spam with garlic rice. I didn't try it but the garlic rice smelled delicious!  Price: A bit on the pricy end in my opinion. I think 12 for my sandwich was decent especially because of the big pork belly. Spam and eggs are cheap so I couldn't justify paying 11 for green eggs and spam even with garlic fried rice.   Ambiance: We went during a quiet time so the place was pretty empty. Inside looks really nice so this is a great place to go for a nicer meal with friends or on a date in my opinion (especially if you like trying more fusion style food).",

The menu is very unique and it all looked really good. Local owned business. The owner came out to check on us. The food was cooked very well if you like medium rare burgers and salmon. Flavors were so good. Good happy hour. Much more like a restaurant you would find in CA or on the strip.",

Just kidding, but I ate the entire Benedict (apparently it's their smallest Benedict plate). Anyway those cinnamon chips to start were great! I asked the server what's the best item on the menu and she recommended this order. I can't usually say no to soft shell crab, so of course I went for it! The dish was divine for my Saturday brunch and the potatoes on the side were the perfect amount of crispy for my tastes. They also have quite a bit of spice, which I loved! The server, May, was such a nice person and the chef/owner Matt was genuinely kind. He stopped by my table to have a conversation and get to know me a bit. It's the little things and friendly environment like this that make me want to come back!",

And with no reservations?  Well, I was in this situation last Saturday.  Thankfully, Served bailed me out and provided a wonderful brunch to this motley crew.  Even without reservations, the staff snuck us in and seated us pretty quickly.  While the majority of my party ordered regular \"American\" breakfast food, I could not pass up the longsilog, which came with 3 crispy-cooked links of Filipino sausage, pickled papaya, and garlic fried rice topped with 3 fried eggs, just like Mom used to make (if you grew up in a Filipino household).    My brother-in-law did get the soft shell crab benedict, which he \"crushed,\" leaving the plate clean.  Other offerings at the table included some huge omelets and a few orders of blueberry pancakes.  By the end of the meal, all of our plates were empty, but our bellies were full",

    "text": "Now that I've been here three times I need to update my review to reflect how much I love this restaurant. Each time I return I find that improvements have been made to a place that is already so great.   The menu offers a great variety of options. On the weekends they offer both lunch and breakfast options. Breakfast options not only include dishes like benedicts and French toast, but also Filipino breakfast items. The lunch menu is extensive as well and includes burgers, salads, tacos, and more Filipino dishes. It would take awhile to work your way through all of the menu options. The chef also seems to experiment with new dishes often which further adds to the nice variety of menu items.  Every food item I've had here, lunch or breakfast, has been delicious. Most recently I ordered the Short Rib Benedict. Every last bite of this was delicious. The short rib was tender with a delicious flavor in every bite. The sourdough bread instead of the traditional English muffin was a step up from the usual. The bread was buttery and the poached egg was perfectly prepared. The hollandaise sauce was tasty. The breakfast potatoes on the side were crispy and nicely seasoned. My husband had the Teriyaki Burger which was out of this world and paired with also out of this world Crispy Potato Nuggets on the side.  The service is always friendly and welcoming. Our waitress on our recent visit was great, checking on us frequently and providing friendly service. During two of my visits the chef came out and talked to all of the tables to make sure everyone was happy with their food. I love when a chef/owner cares enough to come out and talk to their customers.",

The location is kinda weird almost hidden if I hadn't book marked on Yelp I would never just happen to find this place on my own.     The inside is very simply decorated and the shades were drawn down which perhaps made it even more simple. Perhaps some sunshine and change of color on the walls would do wonders!     With that said I did not give a damn about the atmosphere because the food was awesome!!! My boys 2 an 11 yrs shared a side of bacon and the burger with tater potatoes. The bacon was delicious thick slices and had some sort of glaze on it that had my 2 year old fighting for the bacon! The burger was juicy  and delicious and they obsessed with the potatoes tater thingys! My husband ordered the Filipino breakfast with longaniza and fried rice and I order the cheese pupusa's topped with beef and an over easy egg both were Nom Nom Good!     This was not your ordinary multicultural menu these were some fancy and delightfully unexpected dishes and we will be coming back for more!",

    "text": "My husband and I have been dying to try this place. So recently, we went on a Friday afternoon around noon. There were only a few tables sat. Very quiet. I wish I could rate the restaurant higher,  but for me, I feel like the reviews hyped it up and it definitely didn't hit the mark with me. I could be bias because I'm Filipino and have eaten at tons of Filipino restaurants. I expected more from this fusion.  The chips they gave to munch on were yummy. They had no Filipino drinks, which I thought was strange since they have a few takes on Filipino dishes. They only had like apple juice or oj. Why not offer Calamansi or melon or coconut?!?   Anyways, my husband ordered the langonisa burger which he gave 4 stars. It came with mac salad which I felt was bland and lacked any real flavor. He compared it to like a Hawaiian salad, and he even thought that Albertsons mac was better.  I ordered the pupusas with some kind of meat and cheese and honestly didn't taste like anything. The plantains were the best thing on the plate, fried and sweet. But when I sent it back for not tasting at all, they took it haha.  So then they apologized and asked me what else I would like. I tried the tocino take they had. It's not like your normal tocino. The \"tocino\" flavor was on fried pork belly, which consists of mostly just fat. It may have tastes better if it was crunchy. But it was literally all fat. I couldn't eat it either. The garlic rice was no good either. (Better at baby stacks or any Filipino buffet).  It just lacked any real taste. I also thought it was weird that the waitress didn't ask how the food was after the second plate was considering the first one was horrible. She prob thinks I'm a complainer lol but I just tell it like it tastes.  I won't return. But my husband might with some of his friends who've never had Filipino food lol. Price seems like it is at any other restaurant in the area, average of like 15 bucks a plate.",

But I have to say, this place was disappointing. I'm always willing to pay higher prices for exceptional food. This food was average at best. Nothing different than an average breakfast chain.  Overpriced for underwhelming food.  I ordered over easy eggs, and they came way over cooked. I was then up-sold a side item, which he ended up forgetting to give me. But he said, \"you won't get anything like this French toast anywhere\" wow! I was excited to try this French Toast winner. I'll just say, sigh, disappointing.  The service was confusing. With the high price point, you would expect good classy service, but this guy was, how should I say it, tacky, rude. Made the poor little girl at our table so uncomfortable with his \"just kidding jokes\". Made constant silly jokes, forgot a part of my meal, and when I asked about it, he made me feel like I was wrong. I basically had to argue to get this French toast, that he convinced me to try. This server blew it. When you pay $25-$30 for breakfast per person, your server should be attentive and kind.  Our table left paying over $65 for an average breakfast and decided we will not be returning.",

    "text": "I usually take at least 5 minutes to decide what I want off a menu, however at Served, it took me 15 minutes and I was still hemming and hawing when the waiter came. The menu is filled with the most interesting, mixed plates and it's hard to decide what sounds really appetizing and what sounds a little too weird of a combo. The restaurant is very small and has what looks like leftover carpeting from a previous tenant. First walking in, I was a little worried that I had chose the wrong place and that the Yelp reviews were all a lie, but DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU AWAY.  Corned beef bread pudding benedict: Oh. my gosh. The texture of this plate was perfect. Corned beef is usually too salty for me, but the one at Served didn't have me downing waters. I wasn't too sure what part was bread pudding and what part was benedict, but the combo worked.  Pork belly benedict: Separately, the benedict and the pork belly were not the best I've had, but the combo made it good. It was all a little dry, but after popping the egg, it was fine.  Blueberry Pancakes: We ordered something \"normal,\" just in case the \"cultural favorites- redefined\" dishes didn't work out. The pancakes were definitely some of the best I've had. Huge stack for a much lower price than other entrees on the menu!  The serve breakfast and lunch all day. The presentation of the food is adorable and the waiters were very friendly. It's the perfect place to come with a date, a SMALL group of friends or even maybe your hip mom. It's too small for large groups and their eclectic menu may be too much for grandma and grandpa, if their idea of breakfast is 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon and hash browns.  It almost hurts me to write this review. As much as I want Served to succeed, I also want it to stay secret and hidden. The restaurant is so small, I'm worried that coming in on a weekend would be impossible with a bigger following.",

We saw two tables being neglected while we were waiting for our table.   After we sat at the table, we waited about 10 minutes. One server took the table who sat after ours first. She didn't acknowledge that she would be with us shortly or anything like that, even after I made eye contact with her.   There's obviously a lack of communication with the hostess and the servers of which tables to take orders first.   At that point, our food was going to take too long to get so we left. Very disappointed because I really wanted to try their food.",

If you are in the area it's a definitely go try, be careful though this place only has about 10 tables so space is very limited. But high recommendation to go try some breakfast food. The chef who is the owner came to the table and couldn't have been a nicer person too. And prices are very reasonable",

From your typical breakfast sandwiches to some tasty Salvadorian and Filipino dishes, which I was not expecting.   Being Filipino ourselves, my mom and I decided to order the Longsilog, which is a traditional Filipino breakfast sausage dish. The sausage(longanisa) was delicious and meaty. It also had a slight charring on the outside, like it was cooked over a grill. Not typically how it's served, but tasty nonetheless. The longanisa was served with three eggs, garlic rice, garlic vinegar, and a side of atchara(pickled papaya). I feel the dish could have used more rice, but that could be just because I liked the rice so much. We also ordered a side of Kim Chee, it was pretty mild.   And I can't recommend their cucumber juice enough!  Light and refreshing, it reminded me of honeydew. Perfect end to my meal.   Overall, great place. Service was quick and attentive from both the servers and chefs. I look forward to dining here again.",

They bring out complimentary cinnamon sugar chips with a Nutella dip that is amazing! I had a custom 4 item omelette with the most amazing maple bacon in it. It was a huge portion with a side of potatoes. One friend had the crispy baked berry French toast, which was delicious and had homemade whipped cream on top. The other friend had the breakfast sandwich, which was also delicious and had that same maple bacon on it. It's a worthwhile trip just for the bacon! Don't miss this place!",

I ordered the pork belly Benedict that came with some fantastic Asian spices and a sweet chili sauce. It was honestly the best pork belly I can remember.

    "text": "A perfect example of Vegas' neighborhood eatery.  Small, welcoming, friendly, serving food with attitude.  What do Korean, Filipino, Peruvian and down home American food have in common?  NOTHING.  Except that they are all on the same menu at Served.   Not to fear, non-American dishes are not 100 percent authentic but represent well.  They are all boldly flavored with no regard if they pair with one another or not.  With their large portions, there is very little chance you'll be ordering two mains at the same time.  Note:  Breakfast review (the full starters and lunch specials menu is also available).  The comp, crispy cinnamon dusted flour tortilla chips are crack in a basket and a great way to whet the palate.  As a starter, the loaded truffle parm nuggets with roasted wild mushrooms is solid and actually as advertised.  Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside Yukon gold wedges, and a plethora of meaty, well seasoned wild mushrooms dressed with real truffle oil and a load of parm.  A handful of vegetal micro greens adds freshness.  Good eats.  For mains, it's all about the bennies.  All showcase a well made hollandaise with just the right touch of tarragon vinegar and beautiful, soft poached eggs with perfectly fluffy whites.  The base differs to best suit the dish.  All just work once the egg yolk is burst and mixed with everything.  For example, the \"Turf Side\" with sliced filet, aggressively seasoned, EVOO coated, roasted mushrooms, on grilled sourdough; burst the yolks, mix it up, the flavors blend beautifully.  The same is True for the \"Korean Spicy Pork\".  Juicy, spicy, slightly sweet, well marinated pieces of grilled pork atop crisp shrimp rice balls.  Again, burst the yolk for creamy richness that reduces the spice and blends it well with the seafood.  Micro greens garnish all dishes not only making them look good but to add freshness.    Tip:  Wednesday is Industry Day.  Check with the servers for rotating specials.  Limited list of libations including a bottomless mimosa (orange or guava) option.  Vegas style start to the day done right.",

    "text": "Came for Brunch to celebrate a birthday and had horrible service. Although we got seated right away, the remainder of the our experience was shitty. We waited a long time for our food, at least 45 minutes after ordering.   First off, we never got our Cinnamon Chips and our server forgot my beverage order which was only a mango iced tea. There was three of us dining and we ordered a Filipino breakfast and two orders of braised beef short ribs Benedict. The Filipino Breakfast was served 15 minutes before the Benedict's. (Courses should be \"Served\" in a timely fashion in which all guests at the same table should be served the same course at the same time). Keep in mind that the restaurant was NOT BUSY but somehow, Several People came in after us and they got served before us. Still don't understand why our food took so long as they never provided an explanation. As we got our meals, I noticed that the serving PORTIONS ARE SMALL and was OVERPRICED.  I never got my toast that was supposed to come with my meal and the short ribs on the Benny were mostly fat and grease, barely any meat.   After we finished eating, Matt (the Chef), did his table touches and ask us how everything us. We simply responded \"alright\" with disappointed looks on our faces. The chef asked what was wrong and we responded that the short ribs were way too fatty.  Matt responded sarcastically and said, \"have you had short ribs before?\" I was so annoyed with his \"smart-ass\" question and didn't expect that from the chef who runs the joint. So unprofessional. For your information Matt, Yes we have had short ribs many times before at other restaurants and have had better quality than the crap that you served!  After getting the bill, they only comped one beer for a merely $6 for the shitty service we had.   Overall, our experience was horrible. Service was slow, portions were small, meals are overpriced and the chef is a True Asshole. They should really think about changing their restaurant name as \"the SERVED\" doesn't suit them at all. The restaurant is located in a random office location and trying to be a classy restaurant. So Lame!! I don't understand how there are so many good reviews. Unfortunately, yelp requires that I rate at least one star when it should be No Stars. I would never recommend this restaurant.",

Skip the booze if you come here. - We didn't get complimentary snacks before our meals like everyone else.  Overall, I'll likely be back again for the curry. Good stuff.",

One for our drinks and order. After that she disappeared and came back when she realized our waters were empty. We were waiting for awhile for more water.  But other than that, the food was amazing. I'm Filipino and I'm not a big fan of Filipino food. But what I liked about this place was the mixture. The chef mixed it up and tasted pretty darn good. You usually get served Filipino food with a bunch of oil and looking at it makes you sick. However, this one didn't! Best part, the chef comes out to check on the you and your food. Never have I been to a spot where the chef comes out and checks up on the people he or she makes food for. I thought it was really cool. I wanted to see what inspired him to incorporate Filipino food with his dishes.   Other than that, I'll be back next time to try their Ono Chickens!",

This is our first time here and I have to say....hands down....the best breakfast we have ever had.   Matt's omelette (healthier option) and the corned beef hash Benny (not so healthy). My wife and I shared... splitting each in half. OMG!!!!  So freaking good!!!!! Those potatoes though. This man from Ireland was a happy boy on Patty's day.   Service was also super great.

    "text": "This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Henderson.   First off --- kudos to Chef Matt for his delicious recipes and his creative spin on different foods that he blends together from different cultures. I'm Filipino, and I appreciate that he can make some of my favorite Filipino breakfasts. When you go there, the Benedict's are the must try first.   When I went for brunch, I had the Korean Spicy Pork Bulgogi Benedict and the Tempura Bacon Pancakes. Both were crazy good! The pancakes were way too heavy that I couldn't finish them. Wasn't the Chef's fault. It was just my stomach reaching its max. But I had absolutely no regrets. My buddy had the Portobello Mushroom Benny. That looked good too.   When some friends came in to visit, I took them here for dinner. The pastas were incredible. I had the Beef stroganoff. My friends ordered some other pasta dishes that were the chef special for that night. Both were good. The beef stroganoff is a must try!   The Servers are all very friendly and helpful. I've only lived in Henderson for less than a year and I feel like a True local when I come here. I can eat, have a beer with friends, and connect with Chef Matt and his Staff. I look forward to coming back and trying something new on the menu.",

Well, as luck would have it, The Kitchen Table had an hour wait and I was HANGRY. We began searching Yelp, looking for something close. Served popped up, less than a quarter of a mile away. We went there instead and boy, am I glad we did!  We were sat immediately and waited on by Mark. He was attentive and informative throughout our entire visit. He told us all about the mimosas, the complimentary cinnamon sugar chips & nutella dip and a little about himself also.  With the company of my best friend, my guava mimosa and the sweet, sugary chips and dip, I was on cloud 9 - it couldn't have gotten better! But it did. The food came out promptly and cooked to order! I had the green eggs & spam...OMG! Best brunch dish EVER!  Overall, 150% satisfied with my A+++ experience. I am so glad I missed out on The Kitchen Table.",

I've been wanting to try this restaurant for months now and I was not disappointed.  Our server was super nice and energetic.  My daughter and I ordered tocilog and longsilog, definitely a cultural dish on one of the islands in Southeast Asia. The tocino meat tasted homemade, lightly sweet, seasoned perfectly but the meat was cut too thick. It was hard to chew.  I was expecting a thinner slice of meat.  I got a bite of the longaniza (sausage), it was lean and tasted fresh, seasoned just right. The server stated that they cure their meats and make sausages from scratch. They do taste fresh and homemade. The dish came with this amazing garlicky pan fried rice, pickled papaya (only a spoonful, hoping for a decent size), 3 sunny side up fried eggs. They even have the exotic blend of white vinegar for dipping the meat. Our other  guests ordered the Seoul Benny Benedict and it looked yummy, anything with Korean grilled short ribs is heavenly! the Huevos Rancheros breakfast looked like a hot mess (lol) on the plate with so many components on top of each other but  it tasted equally delicious accdg to my friend. I wish I had a bite to kinda' give you more of how the flavors came together.  The Benedict's menu is a must. It's definitely a fusion of flavors and this restaurant offers an eclectic menu that keeps you wanting to go back for more and try some interesting  dishes.  A great place for breakfast!   This is a minimalist, casual dining joint. The chef comes out and takes his time to greet all his diners...impressive!",

Pork Belly Benedict was perfectly seasoned and super tender topped with a poached egg and that sauce!!  Shredded Beef Barbacoa Benedict... holy sh**. It was good.  It was stupid good!  Everyone was so nice from the time we walked in till we left.  The chef came out of the kitchen and walked around to each table asking how everything was and I really appreciated that.  Nice gesture!  Madeline our server was so nice.  Gave us the perfect amount of service.. not too much and not too little.  Our entire experience here was excellent.

Our large group was greeted by a waiter who came to the end of our male dominated table and announced the bottomless mimosas that they offer on the weekends. Then, he turns and looks at me and says, \"unfortunately this lady can't participate. But, she can sit back and observe you gentlemen enjoy.\" I have no idea why he said this?! I wasn't planning on ordering one, but was appalled at this comment. We have a large party half of which are 13 year old boys. Is he assuming that since I'm \"the mom\" I have to take care of everyone? I was also holding my four month old baby when he said this. So, new moms can't enjoy mimosas? And, how dId he even know it was my baby or my kids? I just feel like a lot of very sexist assumptions were made very quickly. This guy was out of line.   The food was actually great!  Interesting combinations of flavor and huge portions. The chef even took the time to come out to check on our food, which meant a lot since they were super busy. If not for the asshole server, who should be fired, this would definitely get five stars.",

This place feels like you're walking into somebody's living room .. which is not a bad thing because the staff makes you feel so welcomed the moment you walk in. They were all very nice and inviting . You could tell they had a lot of regulars. I had a coffee, my girl wanted a cappuccino but they don't have a machine for that ... at first that was a little annoying but the guava juice they brought more than made up for it. They also brought out house made chips with salsa , meant to help you pass time but it wasn't much wait to be honest, we took more time trying to figure out what to eat than them taking time making it ! Everything looks good on that menu!!  We finally decided on the Wellington burger and the short rib Benedict , maaaan that was amazing !! The mix of flavors and tastes were out of this world ! And to top it all of , Chef Matt Meyers came out himself to check if our food was to our liking, and even chatted with us about the mushrooms and different flavors he uses !!  Hats down to this place !  We'll come back again and again and we'll tell Everybody about !  Our contribution again to small business Saturday !",

I went in a group of three. As an appetizer, we got an order of the Lumpia Fillipino Eggrolls...Very tasty and served with a sweet chili sauce and vinegar mixture. Entrees--I ordered the pupusa...It was a perfect portion and was beautiful. A cheese pupusa with a nice helping of braised beef and a perfectly poached egg. Another ordered the kabocha curry--large portion but DELICIOUS. The crunchy, battered and fried kabocha squash paired nicely with the creamy curry sauce and rice. YUM. Lastly, the avocado pancakes were ordered. My two acquaintances really liked them...they tasted \"homemade\" (thank goodness right?! ha) and were very fluffy. However, I was unimpressed...seemed too standard. I was expecting something much more out of the box when the menu says \"Avocado pancakes\".  This is a great restaurant in an unfortunate location. Needs more foot traffic and more successful businesses around it.",

    "text": "Simply extraordinary.  The home made chips and salsa to start our breakfast sounded strange but were incredibly good .  My spicy pork belly eggs benedict was served on a black rock as a plate and were a sight to behold ! Even better was how good they tasted ! My daughter had the apple tempura pancakes.  I can honestly say that they were the the best sweet thing I've ever had as a breakfast.  Totally flavorful and balanced.   The service was incredible with the chef himself coming out to check on our meals.  Coffees and waters never ran out . This place is on my \"must come back\" list when I get back to Vegas.  If you live anywhere near and haven't had the pleasure,  stop whatever you are doing and get down there !!!!",

    "text": "Okay I'm sorry but I'm a foodie with a lot of knowledge and experience of what good food is. There are so many folks today cheering on establishments food and service; just because they feel the need to better their \"juice\" within the restaurant and the community. I'm calling bullshit on those that know nothing of good food, and call the crap they serve in this place \"Amazeballs\". First and foremost... the prices! I mean talk about taking advantage of MacDonald Ranch citizens lol . Let's set our menu prices so high that nobody's gonna escape with a nominal bill for breakfast or lunch. When a restaurant asks for $15 to $17 for eggs and $25 for a burger, someone like myself is coming round the corner to \"Check Yourself For You!\"; especially with average to sub par food at best. Philly cheese steak sandwich was floppy, messy crappy flour'y fake cheese sauce, about $1 dollar worth of 3 slices of beef and completely falling short or both taste and chunks onto the plate and the floor. Do not order this... you've been warned. It lacked and flavor and was bread heavy. Sweet potatoe fries were cold and disgusting, with some kind of loose breading that made them taste like they were breaded in sand. The burgers were nothing spectacular and the eggs Benny dishes at the table were convoluted sloppy concoctions of watery messes. I've officially had it up to my eyeballs with temporary POP-UP restaurants, that think throwing bunch of Asian Fusion shit together; is going to make people bow down and cry over this food. In fact I'm sure there are more folks lying to the staff about how wonderful the food is; when in fact those same people are saving face until they can get the hell out of here ASAP minus their $$$.   I give this place a few months of survival. I'm truly sorry for writing such an abysmal review, but either patrons have zero clue what good food actually is; or they are trying this one time, leaving ripped off and ending up right here on Yelp. Asian Fusion went out with TexMex. BTW may I have my $100. bucks for breakfast back lol? PS. Would the health department of Henderson please review the cloth shower curtains hanging in the entry, separating the kitchen from the dining room. How gross and unsanitary of an idea this was. Can you not afford a kitchen door with the thousands of dollars per day you guys are on the take. for lol?",

Chef Matt brought us the Crispy Baked Berry French Toast,  Soft Shell Crab Benedict and Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict, which were all amazing.  I have never been a fan of egg Benedict because of the hollandaise sauce and Chef Matt changed my mind. The hollandaise sauce was perfect on top of the perfectly cooked egg. The portions were just right and the presentation was beautiful.  I can appreciate a business that truly cares about their customers. We will be coming back to try the other culinary delights on the menu.",

One improvement I would like: cappuccinos please. I enjoy a cappuccino with breakfast and brunch.  Second visit, about 4 months later: the food has noticeably changed from our memories. Bigger portions and greasier, heavier food. Not sure if the cooking staff turned over or what but we felt the quality had diminished and we likely won't be going back a third time.",

I opted for the Pork Belly Benedict and I was not disappointed.  The pork belly was very tender and not too fatty.  A very thick cut, about an inch I would say.  It's over a sour dough instead of an English muffin which was a great choice.  The hollandaise was not thick and not runny.  The house potatoes was amazing and had a little kick.  My mom ordered the homemade longsilog and it was perfect! They even added atchara (pickled papaya)and vinegar which is unusual at most American places. The service was great! Cassandra was always refilling our water and always so pleasant to talk to.  The chef came around to check on us and offered to get us anything else.  Something rare now a days.",

    "text": "I was disappointed. It was our first visit and we were excited because we like supporting local eateries. Plus I heard good reviews.  Our party of four arrived shortly after they opened for breakfast. We were one of three tables. The server was nice and promptly took our order. He forgot my drink, but no worries.  We got our cinnamon rolls right away and were off to a good start. Delicious. Then we waited. And waited. And waited for our meal.   I could see the panic showing on the server's face as he kept looking at our table to see if the food had been delivered. It had not. Yet instead of coming by and honestly explaining there had been an issue with getting the food to the table timely (maybe it hadn't been entered, maybe the kitchen was behind), he avoided our table like the plague. No check in, no coffee refill, nothing. It wasn't until we finally lost our patience that I asked another server what was going on. She apologetically checked. She came back to say 5 more minutes. This is after watching other tables who were sat after us receive their meals.  Then the meals came out at different times. My daughter ordered the kids French toast, and while the description on the menu just says \"mini French toast\" I am certain she got the adult version...with berries, almonds, etc. I asked this other server if this was the kid version and she said yes. OK fine.  Hers came first, then my son's, then my husband's and she said enjoy and walked off. It wasn't until I flagged her down did I ask about mine. Looking surprised, she went back to check. Eventually our original server brought mine with a very lack luster \"sorry.\"  The food was good. Not amazing but not bad. In asking for the check, we did receive a 10% Yelp discount, although I never mentioned Yelp. The other server was again apologetic but by then it was too late.  I worked as a server and a bartender for years in a restaurant, also opening five restaurants for that company and managing one overseas. The FIRST thing we told servers was to be honest with guests and to do damage control when mistakes were made. At the very least, the original server, upon noticing we hadn't received our meal, should have come to the table, apologized for the mistake and offered something to tide us over or at least show he was working on it. I used to teach my staff that a gesture like that goes A LONG WAY in saving a customer. Or the manager could have come by. Or the bill could have been comped (not what I was looking for).  But nothing was done until I got upset and flagged someone, anyone down to complain. Which again, was too late at that point.  I wish them well but don't plan to return. I hope this can be used as a learning experience for the staff. We all make mistakes. But it's how mistakes get handled that makes a difference.",

Next, we looked at the pics, and suddenly...ooohs, whoas filled the car. The restaurant is in an unassuming spot in a strip mall, but this food doesn't belong in a strip mall...the Crispy Baked Berry French Toast is a specialty of the house and the work put into it shows..its edges were crispy and the berry syrup was good not overly sweet as one might be afraid of. The Soft Shell Crab Benedict..mmm mmm and easily a group favorite. The Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict was another favorite..the Corned Beef was definitely, or at least tasted, like it was made in house..now if you're Filipino, the Tocino Chef Matt serves up with Tocilog is worth trying..a good unique flavor that will never be confused with Orientex or other mass produced Tocino. Chef, great food! Next time I'm in town i would definitely go back. Please let me know if and when you move to another location in late spring..",

Brunch arrived and everything was great. Fast forward waiting another 15 mins for the check. This would've been alright if it was large restaurant. But with only 12-4 top tables and 4 servers that is unacceptable. Again awesome food but service is in slow motion.",

    "text": "Brunch is my favorite thing to do on the weekends. We came here based on yelp reviews eventhough when I looked it up the photos on yelp did not look that spectacular for me to be excited about visiting,at least in my own visual perspective.   For a Sunday this place is empty. Okay it could be some factors but for a Sunday it's a bit odd for it to be just us (1 table) This is my first time to be \"the only table\" to be served, so I guess I expect to be served well, granted we are the only table. I can't complain about the service since it's only us.  It'll be weird if I have to wait 30 mins for a dish. We tried the grilled pork belly benedict and french toast. For the Pork Belly Benedict, it was just alright nothing that would want me to come back & try it again. The meat and fat ratio is more towards the pork fat and the potatoes are extremely dry, bland and cold. As for the French Toast I like the crunchiness but nothing epic. The presentation looks different from other yelp photos. I guess it depends on what fruit toppings they have available. I wasn't asked for any choices, they just came out with blueberries. Overall the food is just okay, like I said nothing that would want me to come back.  This is my first Sunday Brunch that I felt I didn't enjoy my whole brunch experience at all. I think the food is a bit over priced too. I don't mind spending my hard earned cash for good food but I also expect  a total good experience in trying out your restaurant. I really hope SERVE could thrive in the brunch scene.  The potential is there but just not today.",

Not overly complicated with a bunch of random stuff on it. Medium rare the way it should be. Swiss cheese, wild mushrooms and above all sunny side egg.

    "text": "SOOOO GOOD!!  So its a VERY small restaurant in an office complex but dont let that fool you! The food at this hidden gem was DELICIOUS! I ordered the pork belly benedict and was not disappointed. Really good size portion. The thick cut and perfectly cooked slice of pork belly had just the right amount of heat from the Thai chili hollandaise sauce. And to make the experience that much better, the chef himself came out to check with us and the other guests.. its a really small gesture but it was a really nice touch that you dont get much anymore.  The only negative i have was the size of the venue itself. There isnt much of an area to wait for seating. And it was a bit warm inside.   All that aside, i thought it was a GREAT spot! Definitely gonna come back to try the other menu items and cant wait to check it out when they start serving dinner next month.",

The food was great, the service was great, and the prices were good.   To be honest, we went to your restaurant before and it had a sewer smell. We thought perhaps it was a one time issue. This was not the case...same smell. Plus the prices were high for what you get.   I would much rather go to kitchen table next door. Even with a 10% discount I would not go back. Even with a free meal I would not go. You asked me to be honest...so here it is. Good luck.",

She was very nice and tried her best to keep up with the busy place.  We ordered: Tocilog (Filipino breakfast) 3 eggs, sweet cured pork, garlic friend rice, atchara (pickled papaya) & *Portobello Benedict Marinated grilled portabella mushroom, roasted peppers, spinach, green onion, hollandaise, sourdough crostini w/breakfast potato. Both dishes were amazing!  Only downside was, they need more help (maybe a bus person) and it was very loud.  It's a small place, so the voices carry.  I couldn't hear my husband very well and I got the impression everyone else was the same way.  It seemed like everyone was talking loud to drown out the other person.  I will definitely be back, but not with a big party.",

A hamburger from heaven cooked and seasoned perfectly. 12 Oz Patty with lettuce tomato onion pickles AND Cheddar cheese was my choice OMG mind blowing sweet potato fries.If you like M's burger you will LOVE THESE. My wife would not try another dish she was enraptured with their crispy French toast. I watched the attentive staff go from table to table to check on needs always responding to requests with NOT A PROBLEM. To top it off chef matt comes out to ensure he hit the mark.Let me tell you he hits the BULLSEYE.",

First impression when I walked in was the smell..over powered with pinesol! I had to hold my nose. The hostess/waitress was really nice and upbeat but she didnt know the menu...she kept looking at our menu to write things down and everything we asked about she had to go back to ask the kitchen. Ordered a beer had to ask 3 times for it and when she brought it over it was wrong. My water had a few things floating in it. My knife was dirty. She came by to refill water and only refilled 1 glass and walked away while the other 2 were close to empty. Our appetizer came out after our main course. I had to get out of there. Next time I'll order to go!",

I really hope they make it because it's Great.  :)  The Menu Breakfast and Lunch only... open 9-5.  Breakfast is served ALL DAY.  WooHoo!  I'm a breakfast person so I love this.  Although, for my first trip I didn't have breakfast... next time. Their menu isn't HUGE but they have a lot to choose from!   I'm loving the fact that there is a Filipino sausage on the menu used in a breakfast dish as well as in tacos!  Yes.... tacos!  Oh Yea! They have almost everything... from full sized \"entrees\" to sandwiches to salads to tacos to a baked mac n cheese \"of the day\".  So much to choose from.  Everything on the menu sounds D-lish! The influence is American Comfort foods with a Flair of Asian in some dishes. The prices are VERY reasonable for the quality of food and the size of the portions.    The Food My mom has been several times and she has loved EVERYTHING she's ordered to date.   Today... we shared the Longanisa Tacos and the Asian BLAT.   The tacos were piled high with sausage and an Asian slaw.  The crisp and slight vinegar from the slaw perfectly complemented the sweet savory Filipino sausage.  You get 3 of them in an order and while they look like street taco sized... they are filled to overflowing with yumminess! The Asian BLAT had the most succulent pork belly I've tasted... MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. The avocado, arugula and tomatoes on the sandwich were fresh and all these flavors just melded so nicely that I could have kept eating if there was more.  It comes with a small side... I opted for the mac salad which is not your ordinary mayonnaise-drenched mac salad. Oh no... I don't know what the dressing was but it was not heavy and it was not salty.    The Service Friendly, quick, on top of it! Jamie the hostess/server was friendly and quick to get our ice tea, and quickly refilled them (I was thirsty) several times.  They were never empty.  I love this!  She also didn't rush us nor did she hover while we were trying to decide what to get.  It was like she just knew when to come over.  The chef (Matt) also came out to say Hi.  And since my mom is something of a regular now, he chatted with her about a couple dishes and stuff.  It was so nice!  I'm excited to go back to try their Baked Berry French Toast and their Portabello Bennie for breakfast and I really want to try their Bi Bim Bap as well as the Pork Belly Bahn Mi and all of the tacos.  :)  They do Take-Out so call ahead and swing by to pick up lunch or dinner.  I know I will.  :)",

I've had my share of good food, but this place is amazing Cultural favorites, redefined indeed!   The complementary cinnamon chips were already good so we were excited with our food.   My husband ordered Huervos Rancheros, portion was huge and this is coming from a big guy who can eat. Sometimes you have to choose between quantity or quality, this has both!   I ordered the Roasted Pork Belly Eggs Benedict, and I must say I will never look at pork belly the same way ever again! It's melt in your mouth goodness!  Both meals no longer needed hot sauce or any type of seasoning/flavoring because it's already made with flavors that are just waiting to burst in your mouth.  The chef came out to ask how the food was, and this is an added bonus for us! I couldn't wait to post a review, I just had to do it while eating! HIGHLY recommend it, and please keep them busy so they will stay open.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FServedlv.com&s=14e340365666f148cb50293143398b4db8acdcccb443f175ec3736f1af5d5117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Servedlv.com</a>",

    "text": "Service: 3/5 Food: 4.5/5  I actually enjoyed the food quality at Served. It also helps that the restaurant is a new and upcoming brunch place a few minutes from my house! Tucked away in a business office plaza, Served has two large banners that identifies the building from the outside. The inside decor wasn't too attractive and was a bit too dark.   Upon entering, we had to wait a few minutes before the \"only waitress\" finished helping the other guests to get seated for a party of 5. The reason why I gave service 3/5 was because:  1) there was one waitress for 10 tables  2) the poor lady was overwhelmed and had a queue of service requests from all the patrons  We had to wait awhile before we even ordered our food. It was even more frustrating that a table or two got their food before us when we clearly got there first. Again, I totally don't blame her. The restaurant just needs to staff more waiters and waitresses at this place. She forgot things there and here, but I couldn't blame her. We got our free chips about 15 minutes after being seated. 10 tables to 1 waitress is insane.  As for the food --- oh boy! I loved it! I ordered the Bi Bim Ba. It was mhmmmm good! The meat was a slight tougher for my liking, but it was deliciously grilled and seasoned. I'm interested in trying the Miso Belly Sandwich next. My table shared the Baked Berry French Toast and it was sooo good! I highly reccomend this as a dessert to finish off any meal.  Overall, I'd reccomend giving this place another shot to see if the service gets better. For brunch, I highly reccomend coming here.",

    "text": "Reviewing this comparatively new restaurant pains me because I want to favor owner/chef restaurants that feature innovative menus, but our experience was truly underwhelming.  I initially decided against dining here after reviewing the menu and discovering prices were relatively high, but changed my mind after reading many stellar reviews.    I had no problem locating the restaurant in the business park, but on arrival it looked to be closed at 10AM on Tuesday morning.  There is no parking immediately in front so we trudged over and tested the door which was open.  Our charming waitress said the blinds remain closed in the morning because of the heat generated from the sun.  The restaurant is very ordinary with minimal attention given to aesthetics.  In a less than surprising decision, my wife ordered the baked berry French toast (sliced bread pudding, seasonal berries, sliced almond, powdered sugar and a barbecue glaze). I initially ordered the corned beef bread pudding Benedict, but was told the kitchen was out of corned beef so my second choice was the roasted pork belly Benedict served with breakfast potatoes.  Both entrees suffered from overcooking including my eggs, sourdough crostini and potatoes. Her French toast was cut into small squares that were totally dried up even after adding syrup.   The absence of any other customers during our entire visit may suggest others have come to the conclusion that the elevated menu prices are not justified by the quality of the food.",

I often wondered what really differentiated them from getting breakfast at Denny's or IHOP. For most of them, the menu is fairly routine and the food is ok but nothing to write home about. None of that is True for Served. This is a fairly small restaurant ( maybe 20 tables) hidden off of Horizon Ridge Parkway. You really have to know that it's there because it is not visible from the street and could easily just drive by. At Served, the menu is anything but routine. The breakfast menu is loaded with items that you cannot get any place else and you certainly cannot make it yourself at home unless you are a Gourmet Chef. As soon as you order, they bring a basket homemade chips that are coated with cinnamon and sugar. In addition there is a side of a Nutella dipping sauce. Wow is that good. Very tempted to just eat the chips and Nutella and skip the meal. Needless to say I didn't do that. I ordered the Matt's omelet. It looks like the size of a 4 egg omelette but it is egg whites only. It is loaded with turkey, bacon (lots and lots of bacon), spinach, yellow peppers and topped with avocado. It comes with a side of potato nuggets and toast. Has to be the best omelet I've ever eaten. My buddy ordered the triple-decker club sandwich. He ordered it with a side of sweet potato fries. He loved the sandwich. But I thought the presentation was what was really spectacular. Our server, Hunter, did an outstanding job despite the fact that he's only been on the job 3 days. The restaurant manager, Jamie, came by several times to make sure everything was going well and to give us a little history of the restaurant. This is why people go out for breakfast. Outstanding service and food that you could not prepare for yourself at home. I definitely will be back very soon.",

Really wanted to try one of each, but will instead look forward to a return soon. Lunch menus looks equally amazing, and dinner will be a return visit very soon. This is one restaurant worth seeking out from anywhere in the Vegas Valley.",

    "text": "First of all, I've eaten here now twice.  The first time I had a unique concoction of Korean/ Mexican breakfast that appeared to be unique item on the menu. It had Barbacoa and some other Asian food mixed with it? It was delivered to the table in a massive serving that could feed a family of 4. After 2 bites, I was done. The quality of ingredients was poor and I honestly felt like just seeing the food of poor quality and enormous proportion was gross. Oddly my entire family at the table somehow found their food edible. I wanted to send my food back but everything else on the menu was going to take a while to prepare and was unlikely to be any better. I ended up eating alone a few hours later. $20 down the drain and a waste of an afternoon. You would think I would never eat here again, but this morning all I wanted was a nice brunch. We went to Craft kitchen and they had a 45 minute wait... we went to kitchen table and they had a 1 hour wait.... my wife said we should give Served a second chance, so I reluctantly agreed as I was so hungry and it was conveniently easy to get a table here. On a side note, I feel like no matter how poor the food quality of ingredients is here, they will have a built in audience of hungry customers that have no patience to wait to eat at Kitchen Table where you're usually waiting 1 hour to get in on the weekends.   For my now 2nd shot attempt, I decided to eat an omelette to play it safe instead of the weird cuisine that has no business being mixed together.  The serving size yet again was disgustingly large and the food had zero taste and quality. Cardboard toast and bland ingredients. Maybe if I was hungover drunk it would've been edible but the ingredients of Denny's are better than this place. The chef came out to ask my opinion of the food as did every server in the restaurant which was a nice gesture, but I was too polite in front of my wife to tell them I was going to go home to make myself try to vomit instead of digest the food. It made me start thinking trying to make light of the let down scenario, \"what would Larry David do,\" if this was on a episode of curb your enthusiasm. Honestly, I've been to 32 countries in the world, have loved a wide variety of international cuisines, I generally love Spanish and Asian foods but not mixed together,   and pretty simple to appease, but for some reason just the thought of the food here makes me want to slap myself for ever coming.    I am as befuddled about this as you probably are reading this review since there are so many other good reviews (which was why I even tried this new place), so maybe it's just me and this place don't mix. All I can say is if they offered better ingredients like a real farm to table restaurant, and offered a menu variety that doesn't JUST randomly mix Asian and Spanish cuisines, they would also have a line out the door such as Craft or Kitchen Table ( the few phenomenal brunch restaurants in Henderson).  This place could maybe have potential someday but they need to rethink the menu and who their food supplier is.  An interior designer would serve them well too.",

    "text": "Quite pleased with another small business eatery located not too far from my home. Served was the choice for eating out with my workout pals one day to celebrate a birthday. Having never been to Served I was at first a tad apprehension when we arrived at noonish and it was almost completely dead minus a table of customers finishing their meals.  Our table of thirteen was seated at the back of the smallish place, and natural wooden chairs and tables, large windows with light set the relaxed mood.  Menus given, there is a breakfast side and a lunch side, as well as beer and wine. Mimosas all around minus myself who got a cold IPA from Kona Brewery started the soiree. A platter of French toasts bites and a couple bowls of homemade chips, cinnamon sugar with Nutella and cheesy spicy chips and salsa. Delish. Food ordered varied from breakfast to lunch, but everyone commented that it was excellent and I have to agree.  Bill for 3-4 bottles of champagne, appetizers, twelve plates of food and my one beer, $250 minus tip.  Service was friendly and attentive, and when we left the place had filled up a lot.  Would return.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Crispy Baked Berry French Toast, Parfait Pancakes, Apple Pie Tempura Pancakes, Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict, Corned Beef Hash Taco, Shrimp Tempura Taco, Longanisa Taco, Wellington Burger, Kabocha Curry, Asian BLAT.  Previously quite fond of Kitchen Table during Antonio Nunez tenure, the website now basically a wasteland and infrequent tweets of new plates from Javier nowhere near as exciting as the items created over a year ago, it was largely a matter of the similar location and aged reports that the menu was \"all over the place\" that prevented a visit to Served from Chef Matthew Meyer until Saturday morning.  Operating under the idea of \"Cultural Favorites Redefined,\" and featuring the skills of a Cordon Bleu trained Chef and owner of Matteo's Gourmet Food Catering and Personal Chef Services, Served is hidden in a small mall directly adjacent to the one containing its aforementioned competition and with a long, narrow dining space with humble decor plus medium-level rock music the space itself is clean and pleasant, a few paintings placed for color with textured white surfaces, Roman blinds and comfortable wood chairs accommodating perhaps fifty persons.  Told that the Chef's menu had recently turned a corner, the vast array of influences and techniques admittedly a source of worry on any menu if the strength of the kitchen is in question, it was with a brief e-mail sent to Matthew that the Chef agreed to size-down several plates into a make-shift Breakfast Tasting Menu at a fixed cost, all but one of the ten dishes tasted setting a high standard for the genre.  Featuring only one waitress on this particular day, no other patrons yet present at 7:30am but several tables sitting down around eight with two large parties slated to arrive around ten o'clock, it was with a glass of water poured as music played that Chef Meyer presented the first dish, Served's frequently Instagramed 'Crispy Baked Berry French Toast' that sees housemade Bread first baked, then soaked in custard and then Deep Fried with a golden exterior that crackles and gives way to semi-solid sweetness nicely paired to reduced Berries and sliced Almonds plus gentle hint of Bourbon.  Continuing sweet with two styles of Pancakes, the texture perhaps a bit compromised by the size as they did not look as fluffy as the Buttermilk rounds displayed online, Matt's new Parfait Pancakes were largely a combination of two menu items including a side dish made from Greek Yogurt and Honey Granola plus Berries while the \"Apple Pie Tempura\" style was far more impressive, the combination of skin-on diced Apples sauteed in Butter and battered slices a great one-two punch of texture amidst Brown Sugar, Cinnamon and Walnuts that likened a Praline in flavor.  Informed that full-sized portions are substantially larger than what was being served, the Marble Rye Bread Pudding base of \"Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict\" quoted at a pound itself, those who enjoy the flavor of the Cured St. Patrick's Day classic will be happy to know that Served's is both moist and robustly flavored, whether beneath a ladle of housemade Hollandaise alongside crave-worthy Breakfast Potatoes or atop double Tortillas as one of the menu's many styles of Street Tacos.  At first remorseful that a full order of French Toast had not been requested, but quickly realizing that the number of 'small' plates was still going to be quite a bit of food, two more Tacos were served next with both the overloaded Shrimp Tempura and Filipino Sausage even more impressive than the Beef, the former nicely balanced by acid and umami from slaw and sauce, respectively, while the latter trended a bit more sweet thanks to the Sugar Cane and Papaya.  Impressed enough by the Beans and Rice that 2 out of 3 servings were consumed, it was by way of a specially made Slider Bun that one of Meyer's Burgers was plated in a portion that was still quite substantial, the Medium-Rare Angus with a smooth grind topped with woody Mushrooms, Swiss plus the characteristic sapor of Duck Liver and a lightly cooked Egg every bit as rich as the ingredients would dictate, and in its full-sized portion undoubtedly more than a full meal for most.  Rounding out the morning with two more plates, a small corner of the Asian BLAT speaking volumes about the sourcing at Served as each Organic ingredient rang through, those looking for a touch of heat - or a completely Vegetarian selection - would be well advised to take a look at the lightly battered Kabocha Curry that features the sweet Gourd complimented by Bell Peppers and Spinach atop Rice with just a hint of Garlic in a vibrant and creamy Red Curry Sauce.  ****1/2 - Making its way in a city of Public Relations Firms and 'Spin' on the back of little more than the Chef's skills and the quality of his ingredients Served is held back only by its location and the what the local market dictates.",

I really enjoy unique food fusions so that's why I decided on trying this place out as my first bite to eat, but I decided to get the Crispy Baked Berry French Toast. (The menu states, \"variations of a cinnamon apple available upon request,\" but I was told they actually don't do that anymore so I went ahead and ordered it as is). Although I am not a huge fan of berries in general, I actually found the balance to work out well and enjoyed every bite.   The host was kind, the waitress was very attentive, and the chief did a great job with the food and making sure we were happy.   The restaurant inside is somewhat limited seating so I could see it being rather crowded on weekends. It's a somewhat upscale place, but I noticed baby/toddler chairs stacked in the corner so they are kid friendly. Depending on how crowded they are would probably determine if I would bring my toddler though due to it's size and overall feel of the restaurant. I will most definitely be returning though.",

I knew it wasn't gonna be like the traditional cuisine and was still impressed. Two cheese pupusas are served and I noticed one was green and the other red, this is because they mix the Maza with ingredients. Green is mixed with jalapeno and cilantro sauce; Red is mixed with ancho chile sauce. Can't wait to come back for the Korean BBQ and beef stroganoff.

    "text": "I'm SO glad I finally got to get SERVED last weekend cuz my hubby was in town visiting!!!   This spot has been on my Bookmark's list for dayyyyssssss, but just never got the chance to hit it up, until last Saturday!   First of all, I totally judged this book by its cover (with nooooointention to do so), it's just that it's located in a secluded shopping center that doesn't seem like it would have a restaurant centrally located, but once you're inside the restaurant it's super cute, clean and cozy with about 12 tables inside.   We were pleasantly greeted with smiling faces and were seated right away. The menu?! Wow, the menu is surprisingly plentiful with many choices from traditional, Asian fusion, new specialties and much, much more; needless to say the options are endless! Because I wanted one of everything we trusted our server Cassandra who provided us with great recommendations...   For drinks my husband opted for the Watermelon Lemonade (yep, you read that loud and clear; water-melon-lemon-ade!) but made it a mimosa, so she added champs to it. This was theeeee best mimosa I've ever had, so f/cking refreshing and light; super easy to drink!   For an appe to share, we ordered the *Heirloom Vegetable Lumpia. Oh my, these babies were a great twist from the original lumpias I'm used to from family parties. These Lumpia consist of strictly fresh veggies, filled with zucchini, corn, tomatoes, onions and more! The real surprise was the dipping sauce that had this ginger/garlic/soy sauce/Thai pepper kick which brought in all flavors from each Lumpia bite. This dish surprised me with all its flavors! Order this is delicious.   For foods, we opted to SHARE the Barbacoa Burger in 12 oz and added avocado to the side. Please, please peep my photo, although it does not do justice- this buyer is HUGE- so big that my husband and I shared a half between the both us and we were full. The beef patty is da' real VIP here! The patty is a mix of beef brisket, rib eye, prime rib - you name it, all the best pieces of beef grounded in a delicious patty! Atop that patty you have juicy Barbacoa spread on top like it's jelly, OMG SO gooooood! Yes, this burger will cost you a whopping $25, but trust me it's so worth it!   This review isn't 5 Stars for nothin'! I also loved how the head chef came out to great ya and make sure we were happy with the foods. I can't wait to go back for my seconds, thirds, fourths...you get the idea!   Come by and get SERVED!",

The portabello benedict was perfect and light, it has a thick layer of raw spinach that gives it a nice crunch. The bread on the BLT was crunchy and putting candied bacon on the sandwich was genius. The standard breakfast also comes with everything you need. We met the chef and he was a very nice guy, and we were also pleasantly surprised with the bill.

I had the corned beef benny and it's the best I've had yet! The corned beef was seasoned just right and cooked to a crisp around the edges. The hollandaise was also on point. I also tried the pork belly benny and huevos rancheros, both flavorful and delicious. When my dining companions and I finally came up for air, we were able grumble a few comments about how it was the best breakfast we've had in a while. We then parted ways for a deep food coma slumber.",

The establishment itself is on the smaller side and it was pretty packed when I came on the weekend, so be prepared to wait a little if you come at a busy time.   The wait is definitely worth it, since the food here is packed with flavor, and the service is super quick. I got the Korean Spicy Pork Bulgogi Benny, and it was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. The bulgogi was equally sweet and spicy and succulent and was topped on a mochi- like rice patty. I highly recommend it. My partner got the omelet, and loved it also. I loved the complimentary chips with salsa (the crisps was very well seasoned).   I enjoyed everything here except for the the Kimchi Galbi Fries because they were overly sweet. The fries themselves were sweet (sweet potato fries), and they were topped with a saccharin white sauce and a kimchi sauce. I felt like I was eating sauce with a side of fries. This dish could work for others, just not for me.   Served is a a millennial and foodie friendly joint that has unique fusion comfort food sure to please any taste. I'm looking forward to coming back here to try more.",

The service was great! Our waitress was attentive and kind. The owner of the restaurant spent some time with each table, that's always appreciated!   They were debuting a new menu during our visit so we were able to try new items. The duck Benedict was delicious and had such a unique display. Definitely worth the money! You can't go wrong with the candied bacon and corn bread french toast. I would return to this place again! I cant wait to try out their dinner menu.   A few other notes: there is plenty of parking. The place is small, we didn't have to wait for a table but we were the first ones there Sunday morning. The place did fill up with people so call ahead and reserve a table if you can. Prices are moderately priced compared to the amount of food you get.",

I also, really appreciated that the chef took the time to walk the floor and talk with us for a few minutes about the food.

Next time I'll try to take more pictures honestly I ate most everything before I realized I should take a picture of this amazing food.  I had the egg Benedict with pork belly what a great combination, the pork belly he just melted in my mouth.  My wife had the blackened salmon tacos which was amazing she saved me one.

They stop seating at 2:30p so I recommend arriving early to get a benedict because the hollandaise sauce is made fresh daily, which is a rare find. We came close to closing on New Year's Day so there was only one other table, but our service was outstanding. The server never made us feel rushed and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  Starting the meal, you have the option of sweet chips (which tastes like Cinnamon Toast Crunch) that comes with Nutella or savory chips which comes with a mango salsa. We ordered kimchi galbi fries as an appetizer. The portions are huge and we could've gotten away without ordering anything else, but we're so happy we got the entrees we did. My husband's breakfast sandwich was filling and when asked about his review, all he could do was say, \"mmmm\" while smacking his lips between bites. I had the tamales and they were phenomenal paired with the mango salsa. There was so much food we had plenty for leftovers, which we devoured the next day.  The chef/owner came out and spoke to us, which was very kind. The menu is an eclectic fusion and everything just works. We asked the chef where he got the inspiration, and he said, \"It's everything I like to eat\" and we certainly agree!",

    "text": "After reading great reviews, my friend and I decided to eat Saturday brunch.  Perhaps it was because we highly anticipated the friendly customer service and unforgettable food that others on Yelp described, we were so deeply disappointed.  It was hard to find though we have lived in the area over 15 years.  Tucked away in a multiple strip mall, the signage and exterior are minimal and the interior was bland.  The long narrow room with beige walls reminded me of a place you go to get blood tests.    There was only one other customer  who left after looking at the menu. The waitress, Amanda was very nice and helped us understand the menu.  She said it was the last day for that menu, it was being completely changed the next day.  This should have warned us, but we laughingly asked for items that were going to be carried over to the new menu thinking we would get the best.  WRONG.   We ordered The Wellington burger and pork belly Bernaise.  Despite the lack of customers it took a long time for the food to get to the table.  My friends burger was medium, not medium rare, and the sweet potatoe fries were dried out and over salted. I did not taste the Bernaise on my eggs, because the pork belly pieces (laying on the side of a hot stone which served as a plate) were shriveled and not even hot to the touch. And the tater tots were burned. Amanda apologized and took it away. Since we had not been served at the same time, I had a bite of my friends burger and decided to order one as a replacement. Amanda came back to the table to tell us the fryer was broken now and Fries were not available. She then said the chef would make us a complimentary dessert.  When I bit into the burger it was very well done, though I ordered medium rare. I couldn't eat it either.  At this point the Chef came to the table and dropped a creme brulee plate on the table saying \"here is the dessert YOU requested\".  We had not! Small blueberries and 1/2 of a strawberry was on one section of the top and the rest covered in whipped cream.* He immediately began telling us we should not have complained, that even though he didn't eat this kind of food.  ( He said he ate \"clean\"), customers raved about the dishes we ordered.  He was clearly angry and not interested in hearing our opinions.  In fact, he said it was our opinion not the general consensus.  After 5 minutes of bickering, he left and Amanda brought us the bill minus the cost of my burger.  We left a 40% tip for the waitress but regretted the gesture because the chef would get the wrong idea.  So, this is the reason for this review. We want to spare anyone else that is looking to have a meal were their tastes are of concern...and frankly where the chef is proud enough to eat the food he cooks. Overcooks!  *After Chef left,  we found why...the top was not carmelized..it was black (burnt) and disguised by the fruit and whipped cream.  Shame on him!",

One of my family members got the, rather small, flank steak tacos that were supposedly served with chips however no chips were served. Another member of my family ordered the huevos rancheros which when brought out was cold and had soggy tortillas. Now the meal that I ordered was the chicken and waffles which was a rather bland and unsatisfying meal.           When complaining about the poor quality of the food the chef promptly came out to apologize. However when complaining about the chicken and waffles I ordered he explained to me that \"everyone likes it\" and \" that it is brined beforehand\". This condescending behavior from the restaurant staff should not be tolerated and I implore anyone reading this to again...  STAY AWAY!!!!!",

It was more than I'd normally spend on breakfast but i ended up taking half home so It sort of worked out.  I'd prefer an option for a smaller portion at a smaller price. I'm not a light eater but the bread pudding was just too dense! The only thing keeping this place from being a five star review is the price point and the out of the way location. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again!",

I ordered the Peruvian Lomo Saltavo and it has an intricate combination of flavors. Each perfectly cooked, not too burned or over salted which most places don't give much attention to detail. There was only one exception and it was a little too overdone on the garlic for my taste. Overall I believe this is our new breakfast/brunch place!",

The tacos come with a serving of rice and white beans which was tasty. I would visit this restaurant to try their food!",

We tried the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict. There wasn't much pork on it, and the pork that was on it had lots of fat. It was served with potatoes, which were kind of cold.  We also tried the Bi Bim Ba. Nothing to write home about. The rice was hard and crunchy. So much so, that we asked the waitress if we could hair have fresh rice. We know that fried rice is usually made with old rice, but it made it almost inedible.   There was nothing that made me want to come back. A little overpriced, and the food wasn't all that great. And since portions are small, you kind of leave feeling hungry.   I am glad I tried it out though, because I like to try small businesses.",

Breakfast, lunch and dinner covered! From Korean, to Filipino, to Latin, to American - seriously what more can you ask for!  I decided to try the following : *Ono Wings & Rice - about 6 meaty wings on top of white rice, drizzled with really light teriyaki-like sauce and scallions! Also comes with Mac Salad. Simple yet comforting! I would do without the Mac Salad since I felt like the lack of flavor/taste! Other than that def a safe, must try dish! *Pupusas - about two in one order, comes with plantain, cheese, braised beef, topped with slaw, red sauce, sunny side up egg and queso fresca! Not the traditional pupusa I've had in the past but still pretty tasty! Shredded braised beef completes the doughy pupusa and love the added egg on top too!  BIG portions, so great for sharing!  You get seasoned chips and salsa, similar to the bread and butter concept, while waiting for food!  Chef Matt, I noticed, comes to every table to make sure everyone is pleased and doing well. I think when a chef/owner shows that little gesture it makes the place just extra bit more special, shows pride and care!   Definitely want to come back to try the other items on the menu!",

My first time back I had seen another patron with the baked berry French toast so I wanted it....badly. I tried to get it on Memorial Day but they were closed, so a week later I snuck away from work to devour this sweet and sexy meal. It did not disappoint. This might be the best french toast I've ever eaten in my life!! The toast itself had a crunchy outside with a soft middle, baked strawberries and blueberries all over it, lots of sliced almonds..and topped with a frangelico syrup. OMG! I will order this again and again and again.   2nd trip back I brought a friend. He had a special Peruvian dish not on the menu whose name I'll never remember, and I had the Pork Belly Miso burger. Chef Matt explained that he liked this Peruvian dish so he tried to emulate it, and it came out great. See photos. I snuck a couple bites from my friend and it was delish! My Pork Belly Miso burger was HUGE and cooked to perfection. The pork belly taste was a little hidden by the beef flavor (I love the marinated pork belly here) and it was juicy and a bit messy to eat. I could only down 1/2 the burger along with the side of sweet potato fries. I loved the flavors.  I'll be back because I love this place and the menu has so many things I enjoy eating. Its going to be hard to try them all because of that baked berry French Toast though....I might be in love.",

I mean, there aren't too many places in Vegas that have an excellent brunch service and Henderson is lucky enough to get two spots in the same parking lot. \"Served\" is in a low key part of Henderson, hidden from the main street in a space that looks like an old office for a medical practitioner, so needless to say this location could use some design love, but it definitely didn't take anything away from the food.   The food, OMG. The food. I went the Miso Pork Belly Burger and that came with seasoned fried potato wedges. This was tough to eat just based pure size, but all of that jaw work totally paid off in full! The Pork Belly was so tender and melted with each bite, sometimes pork belly can be overly salted or chewy and that was not the case here. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium with just a hint of pink in the middle and still super juicy! The potato wedges were crispy outside and soft on the inside definitely fresh cut, seasoned and lightly fired.   Every table comes with a housemaid chips and salsa, which was very fresh and a great snacking option to get the pallet ready for action. The service was super attentive and very fast; chef even came out at one point and asked about the meal. Great hospitality and service seems to becoming the way of the buffalo in this town, but the force is strong here at Served.",

I was happy to get a chance to speak with him about his food.  The staff are very welcoming and friendly. We were fortunate to have such an attentive waitress in Jamie.  She was great in helping us in our food selections.    The tables are SERVED with a basket of house made chips and salsa.  I fell in love.  The chips have an amazing seasoning that are great on their own.  The salsa is so fresh.  Very light and refreshing. This girl would be happy with a meal of his chips.    But I couldn't stop there.  A friend and I shared a few entrees - the Asian BLAT Sandwich & the Blackened Salmon Tacos.  Both unique and tasty!  The sandwich is set apart with the flavorful pork belly and miso vinaigrette arugula.  I chose it to be SERVED with sweet potato fries.  They seem to have a light tempura coating which I loved.  Again... Unique and tasty.    The blackened salmon tacos are built with a vinegar slaw.  Very light, very flavorful! The salmon is fresh.  The mango salsa tops it off perfectly.    I really don't know if my meal could have gone better.  SERVED is a True asset to this city.",

The pictures seemed promising but unfortunately, the food did not taste as good as it looked in the photos.  Pupusa: Beef pupusa served with fried bananas, cabbage slaw and egg. Nice flavor and texture profiles. Savory beef, sweet bananas, and tangy slaw. 4/5  Beef Kalbi Taco: Extremely salty. I couldn't taste anything else. 1/5  Crispy Pork Belly Taco: I was excited to try this. The flavor was alright. Slightly salty and tangy. However, the pork was not crispy at all. 2/5  Miso Pork Belly Burger: Thick slices of pork belly on a yummy burger. This burger is nice and thick...so, open wide! 4/5  Pork Belly Banh Mi: Served with potatoes. The taste was quite forgettable though. 3/5  Service was great. It's just that the food wasn't as great as what people have been saying.",

    "text": "Delicious, eclectic gourmet cuisine. That's what Served is all about! You want a dish with pork belly, kalbi, or longanisa, it's here.  Fried chicken? They've got it. Burgers?? Chef Matt Meyer has got it covered too.   And it's no ordinary meal either. Chef amps it up!! Like Ono Wings...marinated, seasoned well and crisp skin, so ono! He also can modify, and takes special request if time permits. When I was sick, he offered to make me soup. How awesome is he?  Never fails when someone in our party orders the Miso Pork Belly Burger, heads turn.  Not only is it visually mouthwatering, it comes through with the quality beef used and the pork belly made to perfection...every time.    I was in there couple weeks ago when Chef Matt said he was planning on making a Scotch Egg, BUT ..with a Filipino twist to it by using Longanisa instead of sausage. So this past weekend chef made one for me and bestie. Wow!!! I applaud the execution first of all. With the bread crumbs golden brown and the combo of the longanisa, hard boiled egg, paired with Thai Basil rice. Sensational!---Makes great yolk porn pix too apparently. I put that sucker on blast on IG that weekend.  That's why lately you've been seeing foodie'ographers ordering and taking pix of it...lol  Even it's a small restaurant, it's good for groups. Been here multiple times and they easily accommodated our impromptu Framily gathering, crying babies, toddlers and all. The tables are not cramped in. Staff and service have been fantastic. When the chef is not busy in the back, he is out in front meeting and greeting his customers.  You'll find Served in the complex across from Macdonald Ranch subdivision. It's tucked in the back left corner opposite of Kitchen Table restaurant. Cool how Chef Antonio offered his help and welcomed Served into the neighborhood as well! Love how our community supports local business! So see you soon at Served!...but make sure you save a Scotch Egg for me!",

    "text": "Served is a clean, well maintained, cute little restaurant on Horizon Ridge. Our waitress was very friendly and very patient with me as I took forever to pick something out of their very creative menu. Everything looked so delicious. Sadly due to dietary reasons I picked the happy hour ono wings which was $5  (our waitress said it comes with 3-4 wings,we only got 3 per order).  My wife ordered shrimp tempura taco for $3 and the Miso pork belly slider for $5. Both were on the happy hour menu. For the kids we ordered the kids fish sticks and the kids cheeseburger. Both come with a side and a drink, we chose sweet potato fries.    My wife liked the tempura taco and would order it again when she goes back. She also liked the miso pork belly slider but said she would try something different next time.   The ono wings were ok. I was disappointed when they came out to see that they were covered in a sauce. The menu didn't say they came with sauce. I peeled off the skin to remove as much of the sauce as I could. They tasted good and I'm sure there are people that like it better than I do. The first batch of wings that I ordered came out as a mixture of wings and legs. The wings were cooked good but the legs were a little raw inside. It didn't bother me as I have a cast iron stomach so I ate them. I ordered another order of wings and asked for no sauce. They came out and looked good but when I picked up a wing I noticed that there was some sauce on the cabbage bed that the wing was sitting on. So I tasted it and sure enough there was sauce on it. I asked the waitress what kind of oil do they use to cook the wings in thinking that maybe they used some special oil. She said that they used canola oil. The wings in this order was cooked to perfection.   The kids meals were good. The cheeseburger had good flavor and the fish was tasty. The sweet potato fries were cut nice and thin and seemed coated in flour with some seasoning before cooking. The natural flavor of the sweet potato fries shines through and they were delicious.   Despite the issues we had with the wings we are excited to go back and try the other items on the menu that look so amazing.",

Usually Benedict's i always end up hungry after this but was so filling i barley finished it. Then we got the cinnamon chips with the dip and that was yummy as well. For appetizers we got the lumpia and trust me i am pretty picky with my lumpia being Filipino and that was a really good egg roll haha. Thank you manny for an amazing first experience!",

On recommendations, came in for brunch...ordering sweet and salty asked for the chorizo hash and the berry french toast...waitress comes back in a few with the news \"out of chorizo\"..ok, move on to the prime rib hash with cheese on the well scrambled eggs. Food comes out...no cheese...no flavor to the hash, and the french toast is hard as a rock. Doesn't cut with a knife on half the dish...cracks when you hit it. Also...no flavor. Chef comes out...how is everything? Advise no cheese on my eggs as ordered. Before we can go on to address issues with all food, he goes back to bring more eggs...which are runny as hell. Proceeds to argue with us about our impression of the food. Sorry dude...admit you had an off morning and go on with life. Don't berate us in front of your other customers and use \"feeding your family\" as an excuse to treat your customers like crap. Who, by the way, are the ones that make it possible to feed your family! Paid for the coffee (which was also crap) and tipped the waitress. Telling everyone we meet to save your time, money and taste buds, and stay away from Served. Go where the owner recommends...Kitchen Table...guess we'll go there now since we're still hungry.",

    "text": "Hello Matthew,  You are correct, when you came by our table we did tell you things were fine. If you would have checked with your staff you would have been informed that I did complain to the server that the bacon tempura was not good prior to you coming to our table. I would have thought that he would have informed you as the place wasn't to busy. We did hear him tell the kitchen staff about it. Plus if you had looked at our plates when you came to the table, I would have thought the pile of batter on the plate would have been a clue? If you didn't see it then you surly saw it when it was cleared from the table. I didn't fell it necessary to complain twice, your staff should have informed you, that is just my opinion on that. The other thing was the server did ask about a replacement, I declined. I also paid the bill in full without any compensation for an un happy customer.  As for you being a small busy, I am trying to do my part for you. Our first meal there was great! This is an opportunity for you to hear from your customers and maybe take a look at things that need to be tweaked or changed.  I wish you well. This is what Yelp is for to inform and hopefully help.",

It's Asian fusion with a very hipster flare, serving many of their dishes on slate with decorative edible flowers, presentation is their strong suit here. The restaurant itself is small but reasonable since it's a modern breakfast/brunch joint. Service was great, the waitress gave us good recommendations, water was filled quickly, and we were given complimentary chips/salsa as a starter. As for food, I got the soft shell crab benedict and my friend got  the corned beef hash...both were delicious! My benedict was somewhat deconstructed (purposefully) and because of that, it looked beautiful. The only complaint that I have for this place is that it is a little bit pricey (most dishes are $12-20), but if I am ever in Henderson again, I would love to come here again to try the other delicious dishes.",

Location is in a business park with limited signage, somewhat hard to find even if you're looking for it because it's just an unexpected area. Menu has something for everybody, from Korean to Hawaiian to tacos and burgers.   CHIPS & SALSA: Loved the salsa, chips had a light spicy seasoning on them that added flavor. I would consider adding on the guac on another visit.  TACOS: Our table ordered the tempura fried shrimp and the fish (tilapia) tacos, both were solid. Trio of tacos is packed with protein, liked that they didn't skimp like other places. The sauce on the fish tacos had a nice kick to it. ASADA SALAD: Definitely get this with a side of salsa, I liked that more than the creamy vinaigrette dressing. Meat could have been cut a little smaller for easier eating, but had good flavor. I like that the salads include beans for extra protein.  Decor is a little limited, but the cute plants on the tables are nice. The dark carpet and curtained-off cooking areas almost give this spot a banquet hall feel. Staff were very friendly and polite. Menu is fresh and seems to be going for a fairly healthy slant, which I appreciated. They offer all-day breakfast, would try those dishes on another visit.",

Even my potatoes were amazing! The menu has expensive items AND affordable items. Of course my wife got an expensive item. But, my Roasted Pork Belly Benny was inexpensive but was still every bit just as good as my wife's dish. I absolutely love the food. With the variety of prices available, I will definitely be back to sample more. I am so intrigued by what I still have not tried. Thank you Served! Until we eat again.",

While we were eating, a dominos pizza delivery guy delivered pizza to them, and they all sat at the front and ate it  kind of unprofessional for how pricey the restaurant was, also a little  considering we were the only customers in the restaurant. We asked for the Soft Shell Crab Benedict, and our server told us they were out of it (of course). She opted to substitute it for king crab instead, and we agreed. Well, we were not told that would be a $17 surcharge ON TOP of the originally high price. So, this soggy disaster cost me a whopping $32. The food was not good.. I left disappointed and upset about how much I paid. Considered only putting 1 Star but due to the kindness of the server decided to make it 2.  Edited my review to 1 star because of the response. I have worked in many restaurants in my time and it is never ok for everyone to sit and eat a pizza in front of customers--especially with how outrageously expensive the food is. Don't make excuses--DO BETTER!",

Shortly after seating us, she sat down with another woman that was eating. It didn't seem that it was a friend, but perhaps a food critic? Either way, we were ignored most of our time there. Drink refills were slow to non-existent. Aside from my initial glass of water, I was only offered a refill AFTER I had finished my meal. We also saw tables handled by the male server sit down and get chips with dipping sauces before ordering. We were never offered any (our first visit months ago did). The woman she sat with that was eating had her complete attention, we had almost none.    I just wish the gentleman serving the other two tables had attended to us. If our waitress needed to spend so much time with the lone woman diner, she shouldn't have taken on any other duties.    The food was good. But I'll never go back. Spending $100 for lunch, I just expect better service.",

Clearly this is one of those places that has yet to be truly discovered and I am happy about that. Came with a friend and first thing set on our table was some complimentary cinnamon tortilla chips with nutella dip. Super good and anything free is a bonus :)  I ordered the Croissant French Toast and my friend ordered the Baked Berry French Toast w/ cultured berries and port reduction.   The Croissant French Toast was DELICIOUS! Great taste and presentation. Loved the crunch of the honey bunches of oats crust and the banana nutella dip was the perfect compliment to the dish. It wasn't as sweet as it sounded so that was definitely a welcomed surprise.  The Baked Berry French Toast was also very good. I will say though, since they combine all of the breads into this french toast, it doesn't really look too appetizing. The bread looks black and its served on a black plate so it looks kind of \"meh\" but again, great flavor.   Overall, great meal. Taking one star away for the presentation of the Baked Berry French Toast and the fact that it was a little confusing to get into the building.",

    "text": "Maybe it's a one of but I don't understand all of the 5 star reviews for this place.  Most of them seem credible too which is why, even though my first instinct was to leave, I decided to stay and try the food anyway.  Always trust your instincts.    Walking in the shaded door was a relief because although it looked nondescript from the outside, the inside of the restaurant is bright, clean and nicely decorated, even if some of the chairs are a little worse for wear.    Our server sat us and he was super nice (hence the 2 and not a 1).  However, this was where the problems started.  First, we were the only customers.  Second, they were out of many menu items.  Watermelon and guava juice, anything short rib, anything prime rib and anything salmon.  Ok.  It's a Monday maybe they got hit hard this weekend...  Third, we didn't opt for the gratis cinnamon chips with banana Nutella but we should have as we waited quite some time for our food.   Fourth, and most important, the food sucked.  My Korean spicy pork benny came to me cold. It was beyond salty and mostly fat and not meat.  I expect for around $15 that I'm getting quality meat and garnish.  Not so.  My poor mother got the corn beef hash.  She asked me to try the potatoes.  They're sour.  At first I think maybe it's their seasoning.  It's not.  They are old.  I tell her to stop eating.  $40 for us to have 4 eggs between us.  No, I didn't complain. It's not in my nature.  I am a chef and sometimes I feel people do that to get free food.  We just paid our bill and left our full plates.  It would have been nice if the server asked us why we didn't finish or if we were happy but I know he's not a mind reader.  Fair warning to anyone who wants to give this place a try, if it feels wrong don't feel bad, just leave.  There's a nice place across the parking lot.",

    "text": "Served is a gem. It has the deliciousness and quality of an on the strip restaurant without all of the traffic and parking fees.   I have been to Served twice and I'm going to be honest, the first time I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it. I enjoyed the food but the prices were a little steep and the servers weren't the friendliest. Just not a good Sunday brunch vibe. I recently came for a second visit when I had family in town and decided that this would be a perfect place for a group that might want a choice between Asian and American cuisine. This time our server was so down to earth and chill and even the chef/owner came by the table to say hi. What a difference it makes to give a restaurant a second chance!   Let's move on to the food, shall we.  KBBQ plate-- Slices of marinated beef on plate of rice and kimchi. You can also have the same KBBQ as a benedict. Either way it is well worth the price. Delicious!  Berry French Toast-- Slices of bread baked with berries. Nothing too over the top but it was a perfect entree for someone who wanted something to satisfy that sweet tooth without it being drenched in syrup.   Prime Rib Hash and Eggs-- Now this one is the winner! Just a perfect plate right here. Prime rib is cooked just right and it just an amazing savory dish. I can't even describe it, you're just going to have to order this baby on your own.   Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi-- Can you ever go wrong with pork belly? I had my doubts but Served pulled through with a delicious sammy that was moist and fulfilling without losing he authenticity of a traditional bahn mi.   Oh, want to know a secret? Two words-- Longanisa nuggets. SO BOMB. This is a secret menu dish that will blow your mind. Trust. This is an item from their old food truck (Just Rollin') days. Nuggets (aka fries) with all the cheese and longanisa piled on top.   Also I enjoy their diverse menu that spotlights Salvadorian pupusas, Filipino breakfasts, and Korean BBQ! Their complimentary baskets of cinnamon chips with nutella or tortilla chips and salsa were a classy touch.   Would I come back again? Yes. Is it cheap? No. A burger can run you about $25 bucks. However, do know that the quality is there and you can rest assured that your taste buds are in for a real treat. Is it healthy? No. But isn't that what cheat days are for?   Come to Served!

The stroganoff surprised me because it looked artistic- not like the usual heap of stroganoff I am used to. The shredded rib meat and homemade noodles really make a difference in taste and texture. The green eggs tasted familiar and it turns out that the chef adds a Southeast Asia flair to them, with Thai chilis and fish sauce and some other ingredients; we loved it! This place seems to do simple soul food with variations that are both pleasantly surprising (taste) and charming in their presentation. The Krudel featured strawberries and raspberries and we ate it all. Oh, and coffee and service is good too :)",

Crispy goodness on the outside and perfect seasoning!  Overall, I would definitely come back because I can tell the food is really good here and the service was on point! We just so happened to pick the wrong dishes for our tastes but even still we enjoyed it!",

    "text": "I could not be any happier with this place.  What a gem.  Elevated fusions done right!  You can tell that the chef put his heart into his food and gets his cultural fusions right... PERIOD.  I appreciate the fine details in chef's cooking and it shows in both execution and flavor.  The decor of the place is rather plain, and from the outside, you can't really tell its a restaurant, however, service and food were both excellent!  The unlikely pairings of a spicy pork (korean) cheesesteak was spectacular.  With bits of kimchee, daikon, peppers, cheese, served with the side of barbecue-dusted potatoes... so good!  The Kimchee Kalbi Fries was also excellent.  With the gochujang, mayo, daikon, kimchee on sweet potato fries, it was rich, yet balanced and so hard to put down.  Ono wings were...ONO (good tasting)!  Good crispy texture, and a wonderful homemade teriyaki sauce.  With regards to the teriyaki sauce, you can tell the chef put a lot of time and thought into it.  I would say its on the same level as teriyaki sauce from Japan... seriously.  Upon request, the chef even made my son a spam musubi with the awesome teriyaki sauce!  I really appreciate a place where the chef comes out to check on his patrons, that doesn't happen that often in this day and age.  The other half to that is I appreciate when you don't have to lie or be cordial and say the food was good.  The food was actually really good!  The food is a bit on pricier side of things, however, I felt it was totally worth it.  If you appreciate the care and details that go into cooking look no further.  I left this place happy, and I felt like that food critic at the end of the movie, \"Ratatouille\" except I met the chef and he wasn't a rat.  Can't wait to try this place again!",

You're greeted as soon as you walk in.  Felt as though owners and chef were eager to feed you, make you smile, and get you opinion on their food offerings.  Which were amazing!  Best thing we had on this trip!  Thank you YELP.  My bacon pancakes were amazing.  No syrup or butter needed.  And as crazy as it sounds bacon tempura was so so good!  Hubby loved his hash Benny and said it was the best he's had!  But that didn't stop him from cowering down in one of my tempura bacons...  I was very impressed and though we we weren't able to come back for dinner, the next time we're in Vegas we absolutely will be here for breakfast and dinner. Their menu has a good amount of dishes without being overwhelming.  It was hard to decide what to eat.  More than happy with what we chose, and excited to try other items on their menu.  It's less than 15 minutes from the strip.  If you want great food while in Vegas - get to Served!",

I say hidden little gem because it is slightly out of the way for me, but definitely worth the drive. I would definitely be eating here once a week if they were any closer! I have tried many different Benedicts, Huevos Rancheros, the Pupusas Breakfast, Corned Beef Hash, Chiliquiles, Longsilog, and many others. With the vast amount of dishes to choose from, I still haven't come close to trying all of the culinary creations that I want to. At this point, it's still a work in progress! The Huevos Rancheros is the best in Vegas and is a must try dish for sure. Thank you Chef Matt and staff for all of the wonderful experiences! I look forward to the future endeavors that this establishment will have to offer. Here's to wishing, please come to the Southwest area!",

Their menu primarily features Asian fusion breakfast and lunch cuisine, which was a bit unexpected in this neck of the woods. The one knock about this spot is their menu prices are overpriced for what they offer. I'm talking about $20-30 for Benedicts, which are Strip prices for a way off-the-Strip location. But, other than that, the food was great.  For breakfast, we shared the pork lumpia ($9) and I got the longsilog ($13) and Wendy N. got the Korean spicy pork bulgogi Benedict ($14). The food was great, and I loved the lumpia, which tasted slightly different than typical lumpia. My Filipino breakfast was just how I liked it, three longanisa links with plenty of garlic fried rice, 3 sunny side up eggs with garlic & vinegar sauce. The downside? Again, the price, which could've been had for more or less the same flavor and portion size at Grill City for $4. The Benedict was good and we loved that they used rice cakes instead of English muffins.  The best part of this meal? The complimentary house-made sweet and spicy tortilla chips. Holy crap, these are addicting. Believe me when I say these are good enough for me to return for.",

My only regret is that we don't life in Vegas or we this would be a favorite hangout for sure.   Bottomless guava mimosas, a bulgogi Benedict for myself, Barbacoa beef for the hubby. Both spectacular! I would have loved a little spicier version of the bulgogi but I really love it hot and know that's not for everyone.  It was still super flavorful and a delight.   The chef came by several times to say hello and our waitress was awesome, the perfect combination of refilling and being there for our needs but not too often where we felt rushed at this popular eatery. Kitchen Table is in the same complex but this is the real hidden gem of a place to eat. It was fantastic!!",

Wife ordered the breakfast croissant while I ordered the French Toast with cinnamon apples instead of the berry selection (paid $4.00 more but wanted to have some apples)!  While we were waiting out came cinnamon chips with banana mixed with Nutella.  So tasty!  When our order came out, wow, so much food.  Wife raved about her sandwich.  She appreciated that the bacon was not in long strips (made it easier for her toward).  She said the potatoes that can with the sandwich was perfectly seasoned.  My French Toast was bread pudding made into French Toast with Tempura apple slices, cooked cinnamon apple compote, crunches and whipped cream.  The portions were huge.  Wife & I took home half of our meals.  Will go again to try other things on their menu.  Starting August 1st server said they will be open for dinner.  So many things on the menu to try.",

The place looked closed so I got out of the car to try the door; very glad I did as they were open. (Maybe invest in a \"We're Open\" sign?). There was a 10 minute wait as they were full but once we were seated our waitress immediately set us up with our drinks and explained the different menu items to us - different being the key word here.  There were several Eggs Benedict - I chose Pork Belly Eggs Benedict  and was deliciously surprised, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the French bread base was beautifully crisped and seasoned - along with a few Filipino breakfast items and an egg dish with green Thai chili.  There was also Huevos Rancheros with langonisa - whatever that is - that I'll try next time.  My sister had the Bam Slam consisting of two perfectly cooked eggs over easy, fluffy pancakes, crispy yet soft on the inside potato nuggets, and house bacon.  The bacon was overly sweet for our taste; they coat it with brown sugar and pepper, might like the option of regular bacon...  My only complaints relate to their selection of tea: my sister ordered hot tea and all they had were herb or green teas, no Earl Grey, Breakfast or any sort of black tea and they only offer Mango flavored ice tea; I was almost able to disguise the taste with lots of lemon.  Expand the tea selection, offer plain bacon (or less brown sugar) and you'll have a customer for life!",

    "text": "So we live in the neighborhood and finally decided to try this place.  We came at about 10:30 on a Thursday, so the place was not very busy.  The decor is simple and rather cheap.  The prices on the menu seemed rather high for a breakfast/lunch place.  Our expectations, at that point, were not very high.  What a surprise!!!!  The food was the best we had in the neighborhood and we have other places that are fairly good.  What's more, the portion sizes were large.  I had the pork belly bahn mi and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  It had a good amount of pork belly and quick pickled vegetables that were still crunchy the way I like them.  My wife had the bread pudding and she couldn't stop raving about it.  The balance of flavors was clearly superior.  It was large enough for 2 or 3 meals.  Now you have to understand that I rarely rate food places high because I am an amateur chef.  My wife has not liked ANY restaurant since we moved here last year and she is very difficult to please.  She loved it.  The chef came out and we spoke to him.  There are several items on the menu I'd like to try.  I prefer out-of-the box creations especially with an ethnic touch and there is a lot for me to try.  They have a large burger menu and their burgers are made with ground short rib meat.  That's one I have to try.  They do have a limited staff so I would imagine service will be slow if there are a lot of customers.  Everything is made on the spot so it is extremely fresh.  That will take some time so don't come here if you are in a rush or have small children who aren't patient.  Also, if ambiance is your thing, try elsewhere.  But if you come to a restaurant for the food, this is one of the best places you can try.",

The pupusas was awesome, I'd definitely recommend it. It all goes to show, a good chef beats everything else.",

Having eaten breakfast at Parker House, Boston (Parker House rolls); Lou Mitchell's, Chicago; Jazz Brunch at Stein-Erickson Lodge in Park City, Utah; and a few truly wonderful breakfast, Served is a MUST. Everything is scratch/house made. First bite of the corned beef, I knew it wasn't commercial. Matthew, the owner/evil genius, came out to say hello after we raved to our waitress... I asked if the beef was indeed house made and he, somewhat surprised \"average customer\", was happy to tell me all about it. Eggs were perfectly poached, scratch made taters, lovely house hollandaise (with just a tick of cayenne), and the \"marble rye bread pudding\" is really hard to describe, but savory and sensational. Extreme portions. Only thing Louise and I casually mentioned in the car to one another, as we headed back to the highway, was that the carpeted floor was kinda \"shot\". Not stinky, just past its \"best before date\". We both ALSO noticed that management was poring over flooring catalogs with floor installers while we leaving!!! So, no fault there... I have to give them 100/100. Also VERY good and very strong coffee. NEVER met a restauranteur as proud of his place and so attentive to his fare and his clientele. Trying to figure out our next Vegas trip.",

Our dozen children enjoyed their meals consisting of hash and eggs, sweet potato fried and burgers. Our adults enjoyed the variety benedicts (roasted and crispy pork belly), sandwiches, tempura, kalbi and did I mention the pork belly? Oh, and the Bloody Mary's....uniquely mouth watering.

Brought my 6 and 12 year old sons for pancakes and they did not disappoint.  The server works the entire room of 8-10 tables and she was efficient, friendly and helpful. The menu has the specialized breakfast fare with some fine twists. If you're looking for straight down the middle breakfast this isn't it. Glazed bacon, interesting (and tasty) potatoes, thick cut corned beef hash... this is breakfast with a posh side. I go 4 stars because I get the sense they are trying a bit too hard to be upscale. It's okay to ha e some standard items for the kids. Hot chocolate, apple juice and regular bacon is a good start. I'll be back but probably with some business clients. When it comes to the kids I will look elsewhere only because of the menu choices.",

I had the roasted pork belly tacos that were absolutely phenomenal. I also tried the mac salad which was great yet a tad bit on the dry side but everything else greatly made up for that. The chef came around and asked how our meal was and listed the ingredients in our dishes since we loved the diverse tastes. A little bummed I couldn't have a Bloody Mary with my meal but the mimosa made up for it. Waitress was terrific and anticipated all of our needs well! Definitely will be returning!",

I went in for brunch and the entire experience was very mediocre. First, the ambiance is very odd. It's in a business park and the space feels like it was meant for a commercial business. Also it felt as though they didn't have air conditioning so it felt like a sauna the entire time we were there.   The food, which is always the most important part, was not very good. I ordered the Filipino breakfast, which is one of their most popular dishes. The eggs were fine, but the garlic fried rice was so hard it was inedible. I know you're supposed to use leftover rice, but it was so hard it seemed undercooked.   I probably wouldn't recommend this place. Just go to kitchen table which is in the same complex.",

You can tell the chef has carefully hand selected each menu item and each dish displays his creative genius.  From a Korean BBQ Plate to a Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi to Longanisa Tacos, there is sure to be something on the menu for everyone.  The only downside is trying to decide what to try.  Here's my advice, bring a bunch of people so everyone can sample different things. My buddy and I ordered the Miso Pork Belly Burger and the Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi Sandwich.  Both were delicious and very flavorful.  I enjoyed my sandwich so much so that I decided to order the Shrimp Tempura Po'Boy Sandwich to go.  Again, amazing flavors.  I am so happy that this hidden gem has opened up close to my home.  I can say without a doubt  that this will be my new go-to breakfast/lunch spot.  Do yourself a favor and get served at Served!",

It's located in a really low key plaza and the place itself is very clean. The server was very friendly. Hubby ordered pork belly benedict. I got the tocino, which was made in house, and egg plate. We ordered my son a burger with sweet potato fries. Pork belly benedict was average, I felt like a lot of the appeal of this place has to do with how they plate their food but in my honest opinion I feel like it was doing too much. The tocino was good, but I felt like it was so fatty I wasn't left with much desirable meat to be eaten. My 14 month olds kids meal was probably the best dish on our table. The burger was wonderfully made and the shoe string sweet potato fries were delicious. I feel like it was overpriced and the quality of food did not justify the prices. We were told that they do a happy house with tapa style dishes that we want to come back for. Until then, three stars. Glad I tried it but probably won't come back unless it's for trying happy hour.",

We were greeted immediately upon entering, although the hostess/waitress looked at us a little weird, I am not sure if she was busy or what, but I got the feeling she assumed we were two little kids coming in to eat ( I look very young for my age and I took my little brother with me), she stared at us for a little while before asking if we wanted a table. The place is larger than other places around the same area (such as Kitchen Table), good for large parties too. Water was brought out immediately, drinks were not listed on the menu and we were not asked if we wanted something else besides the water, the lady who sat us came back and asked if we were ready to order. The waitress was pretty friendly but it seems that they were under-staffed so she did not really pay attention to us. Pretty much took our order, delivered our food then gave us our check. Our water was not re-filled either.   The chefs did come to each table and asked if everything tasted good which was a nice touch.   I got the Soft Shell Crab Benedict which was pretty good. The biscuits were soft on the inside and grilled crispy on the outside, so buttery and fluffy. The hollandaise was not too creamy, the crab was pretty big and very crispy. The breakfast potatoes were cold when served, overall pretty good dish.   My brother got the Pork Belly Miso Burger with Mac Salad and this was also pretty good. The patty was thick and cooked medium, the pork belly was a BIG flap of pork belly, not thinly sliced... a very big and thick burger.   Pretty good food, would probably come back to try other items if I am around, hopefully they are fully staffed next time. The place was also on the warmer side, it felt a little stuffy, good thing it is nice outside, I think the place will be pretty hot and stuffy during the summer.",

The chef owner and his crew always comes up with awesome new food ideas, and the waiters are very passionate about food and flavors as well. It's a small comfortable little restaurant that has room for at least two big parties (8-10 people). Troy is such an excellent server and is clearly a lover of flavors. I've been coming here every so often for a while. I showed up for the thanksgiving special. Thanksgiving you have to reserve ahead of time and it's 30 per person for the turkey only option + all you can eat sides + dessert. Everything was delicious as always, Turkey was moist, candied yams hit a high sweet note with what tasted like vanilla extract, cranberry sauce had some amazing citrus notes, the veggies were awesome, the chunky mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent. There were some drawbacks, the cornbread+stuffing mix was a bit dry and under seasoned, and the guy who cut our pie slices at the end cut them super small and wonky. But overall everything was wonderful.",

I don't know why but it reminds me of some nice restaurants in the Philippines, could be the decorations but soon as I walked in, that's what I felt haha. Anyways, the staff is very kind! They are also big on customer service. Everyone made sure my family was satisfied at all times. It was really appreciated because there were a lot of us and it is a small restaurant so I could see how serving us would be hard or take time, but the servers were still very attentive.  The food was delicious! Though I had pain in my teeth (from personal problems), I could still taste the flavors of the food. My sister and I got the shrimp tempura sandwich and pork belly burger and shared it.  When it comes to tempura, you don't want it to feel heavy since its fried and you can tell if it's been cooked in old oil. This tempura was nice and light! Super yummy! With the bread and sauce on top, it was definitely something new and satisfying.  The burger was just super meaty and delicious. A good burger alone is one thing, but pork belly too?! YUM! Also, I'm usually a fan of regular fries but the sweet potato fries here are so tasty I'd probably pick them as the side everytime.  Anyways, I will definitely be back to try something new!",

    "text": "What a great lil breakfast/lunch spot in Henderson! The space is not big, but it's really clean and inviting. Quite a few people were already there. Families, couples, and small groups were dining. Upscale casual would be the decor. We were greeted and seated right away and were given cinnamon sugar chips with I think cocoa-cream dipping sauce on the side. It reminded me of cinnamon toast crunch. Unexpected and yum! I ordered the KFC - Korean Fried Chicken sandwich with potato nuggets for the side. I did ask for the Kim chi, relish, and anything that would have been on the sandwich on the side because I wasn't sure what to expect. The chicken is really tasty and really crispy. I added the kim chi, relish back into the sandwich and it marinated and slightly softened the crispy chicken which was much tastier than my original thought of having everything on the side. The potato nuggets were well seasoned and not salty. Actually everything I had was just perfectly seasoned and the presentation was well executed.The Spare Rib sandwiches was really impressive along with the sweet potato fries. Quality and freshness is definitely the cornerstone for the chef. At the end, I was really full and so happy I came to check this place out. I'm glad to know there's such a special spot like this place for breakfast and lunch. Prices are moderate, but the selection and quality is well worth it. I didn't get a chance to catch the server's name, but she was friendly and attentive. Also, there business card says they do catering so I will keep this place in mind for special events. Overall, great quality food, friendly service, and a chef that can really cook. This place is legit! Will definitely be coming back.",

Once the food arrived it was okay. My husband's bacon was barely cooked though, rendering it inedible. Save yourself the time and go to Kitchen Table at the other end of the parking lot.

However, the wait was too long for how hungry we were, so when we looked for other options we discovered there was another brunch spot in the same parking lot: Served. So we figured we would give it a try. It's difficult to even know where to begin to review our excellent experience. The service was stellar, the menu was unique and offered something for everyone, and they offer complementary cinnamon chips and Nutella dip to start you off! Delicious. The food was spectacular, inspired, and presented beautifully. I was given the wrong order by mistake and the speed with which the mistake was remedied was unreal. I ordered the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict and it most definitely lived up to the hype. The prices are a tad higher than what I would normally go for, but it was definitely worth it. 10/10 would go back again, as I now have TWO favorite brunch spots!",

All awesome, all with very fresh ingredients, never too much sauce or garnish. Memorable food.  Even the pre-meal snacks were house made and awesome.  A real treat.  Support this place!

We got seated right away as we walked in. The server was really friendly and answered all of the questions about the food that we were confused about. Then we put in our orders. I'm not sure if the restaurant was short staffed today but the food came out longer than we expected. It probably took about 30-40 mins for our food. One of the reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me. The server was working by herself and she was doing a very good job. Maybe they were short staff in the front too because I noticed the staff in the back started coming up to the front and help her. Great job to the team work there. I would most likely coming back but there should another server in the front to help the poor girl out because it was busy morning! Food was delicious! I will come back again to update my review!",

I had Green Eggs and Spam for $15, not bad at all price wise. The eggs were scrambled with green thai butter, garlic fried rice and spam.....ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! My husband had pancakes with tempura bacon, he liked the bacon but said it was a little much. It was like a pancake fried with a piece of bacon in it. He said pancakes were great. My father in law had the Triple Decker Turkey Club. He said he loved it. The turkey is real turkey, not deli meat and it's huge.

My father ordered the carne asada tacos, my husband ordered the Wellington burger, my mother ordered the shrimp tacos and I had the Korean BBQ plate. Everything was DELICIOUS!!!!! My husbands hamburger patty was so moist and juicy and was by far the tables favorite. We saw that pupusas were on the menu as well and being Salvadorian we were immediately intrigued. The chef kindly brought out a pupusa for the table to share. What a great twist on a pupusa it was was soooo good!! Def will be back when we are in town. Highly recommend this place!",

First impression walking in was this place is smaller than I would have expected. The server sat us and was very friendly. My friend and I shared the pork belly benedict and the  shrimp tempura tacos. Both were amazing, but my favorite was the tacos. The shrimp was nice and plump and the sauce was just amazing. I was actually sad that I only had 1 and a half because we shared.The presentation and color of the food just screamed, \"eat me!\". I also had coffee, which was so smooth. Yum!   The owner came by and checked on us to see if everything was going well. I did not realize he was the owner at first and I didn't catch his name, but he was very respectable and was really genuine about making sure we had a good experience.   Served seems to be picking up by word of mouth because driving by I would not have noticed it. Maybe they are planning for all the doctors to come in from the nearby offices? This place needs to be in the district! I hope this place picks up and can get a bigger, better location. I will be back!",

The corn beef was lean and lite tasting, potatoes cooked perfectly with farm fresh eggs. I tried the Filipino sausage, garlic fried rice and it was solid tasting too. Servings are generous here and the owner/ chef came out to see how we enjoyed our meal. Service from our waitress was cordial.  If your into breakfast like myself, you'll heart dining at served.",

Another nice thing is that the chef comes out to your table to see how you doing and to discuss your meal and dining experience. To me that is a wonderful thing.

    "text": "LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE! HOW DARE DOES ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES CALL MY GROUP OF FRIENDS AND I GHETTO?! ( screenshots) I'm not one to post a 1 Star review. Let me start by saying that the chef was very hands on and the food was great but the waitress was very disconnected. Not fully invested in our table, kept apologizing for her mistakes. We let it slide because we understand people make mistakes. We get it. Now here is where it went south, our waitress accidentally charged my friends card an extra $80.00 from another customers tab (which takes about 24hrs to be refunded)on top of her own bill. This was the last straw. We understand that people make mistakes that wasn't our issue. Our issue was the way it was handled. No type of consideration for my friends inconvenience. They were very nonchalant about the whole thing kept saying it will be refunded in 24 hrs. Okay? That's not the problem, the problem is that the $80 dollars is still pending in her account for 24 hrs. What about scheduled payments that she had already or other plans for the rest of her day? Eventually they gave her a compensation for her meal after we insisted for some type of discount for her troubles.  The moment that one of us share our experience here on Yelp (that's what yelp is for), one of the employees named MANNY decided to take it upon himself to call us GHETTO?! And question our livelihood. Apparently according to him because we prayed before our meal we should not share our  negative experience on here \"IT'S NOT THE CHRISTIAN WAY\" what does that have to do with anything?! The fact that you called us out of our name and called us hypocrites is beyond me. How dare you treat paying customers this way? We decided to use our hard earned money to eat here and this is what happens just because we asked for some type of compensation for our troubles?? I've never been disrespected like this in my life!! Now, I don't want to make this a race issue but I am going to ask if 3 of my friends weren't black would we still be called ghetto? Or would we be called complicated customers? Unfortunately, you lost 4 customers who truly enjoyed your mimosas and food.  I'm in no way bashing the business I believe In supporting small business before I give my service to a big food chain restaurant, but this is unacceptable! Please coach your employees to treat others with respect (in the workplace and outside of the workplace) especially those who CHOOSE to spend their hard earned money to support your business.",

I can't wait to come back and I might just be a regular!   It's in a business park, the building in middle, on the corner, not near the street. Lots of parking and easy to find. Interior and bathroom is clean and trendy.   Server Shawn and Chef Matt was very attentive and quick. Matt has a great attention to detail and really makes his food with the utmost quality. They made sure I was doing well, and food was to my liking. I also appreciated the small detail of a warm towel it wipe my hands.   I highly recommend all the Happy Hour (7 days a week, 2-6PM) items I got: $3 Shrimp Tempura Taco $5 Umami Slider  $5 Ono wings   I also asked the chef for an egg and he made me a delicious Ramen egg. I got the mango iced tea, and thought it was okay at first with one packet of sugar, but surprisingly complemented and balanced my meal very well. My meal had so many savory and unique flavors, which I love, that the drink was a nice way to calm it down.   The creme brulee flavor of the day was an orange cream and summed up my meal perfectly. Not to sweet, just right! The fresh oranges on top was a nice touch. It is a good size to share and since I was so full I couldn't finish it myself.   I wish I had a bigger tummy to try everything on the menu, but that will have to wait for my next visit. Instead, I got some food to go for my lunch tomorrow!   I love the fusion flavors of this resturant and it looks like there is something for everyone. I highly recommend this resturant and happy hour if you're eating alone or with a group.

    "text": "We saw this place on yelp and thought we'd give it a try. Unfortunately, yelp also lead us to believe it was all day breakfast but that's not the case (breakfast ends at 2pm). That was no problem, however!   We tried the loaded potato nuggets (Which were only 5$ since it was happy hour.), the bimbimbap, the french onion soup, and the shrimp tempura tacos! All the food was absolutely delicious. The galbi in the bimbimbap was amazing and the shrimp tempura was nice and crispy.  I think the bacon in the potato nuggets was candied since it was slightly sweet, which I loved since it added a little something different.   Since it was dinner, they gave bread with a green chile ,poblano butter spread. That was amazing.   Service was good, our waitress was really sweet. Definitely need to come back to try breakfast, soon!",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp we found Served and stopped in for breakfast. Served is located at Horizon Ridge/Valle Verde in the back of the office complex. We arrived just after 9:00 and were the only two there until just before we left. The menu at Served is multi cultural with Filipino, Spanish and Asian influences. After seeing pictures of the berry french toast I had to order it! The food did not come out until about 9:35, almost 30 minutes after we ordered. It was far too long a wait for being the only two in the restaurant.   Chef/owner Matt brought the food out and apologized for the wait. The berry french toast was nicely presented with berries, sliced almonds and whipped cream. As Matt explained, the french toast starts off as a bread pudding which makes it so delicious.   He also uses several different types of bread which mixes up the flavors and textures. The side of potatoes we ordered were also fantastic. Nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The food was 5 stars. Matt came back to see how we liked it and explained his cooking style and made sure we were happy with the food. I will definitely be returning soon to try out his lunch items.",

They have a bread pudding corn beef hash dish that sounds very interesting also.  All the food looks good.  They also have some Filipino favorites as well if you are into that.  There is something for everyone.  The staff is friendly and eager to please, the chef has come to our table every time we have been there...a very nice touch.

Heavy as in energy-wise. The energy in this place is really, really low. It did not give us a good dining experience. I truly wanted to give this place a great review but i just could not. I will give credit when credit is due & based on my history of reviews, I will also fairly give a negative review when it's due.  Our server Cassandra was an exception. She was sweet, nice, & patient with this patron especially after I told her that it's our first time in their establishment.  There were two people, Jaimie and Phil who approached our table, well, Jamie just kind of talked to us in passing, & each of them explained why it was so slow. We were the only people who were there at the time (see video) & there were two older couple who was there when arrived. They said it was because of the \"It's a beautiful life\" event that may be causing the slow turns and that the young people who frequent their establishment are all still asleep with hang overs, either way, we did not care why they were slow. It just felt like there was so much explanation being made to justify why we were the only patrons there. IT REALLY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. Not to mention just how eerily quiet it was in there. Talking in low voices seemed like the whole place could hear our conversation.  The food, however, was good. We ordered and shared the Pork belly benedict and the crispy blueberry french toast and the flavors of these dishes were good. But sometimes good food coupled by a negative familiarity do not make for a stellar experience.  I TRULY HOPE THAT THEY WILL ONLY IMPROVE AND GET BUSIER BECAUSE \"SERVE\" HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL.",

    "text": "Matthew & I arrived at Served after a somewhat rough morning. Being a 23 year old female, I just can't help my mood swings but somehow I can always be pacified with a nice breakfast & an absurd amount of coffee.   Make sure you have Google Maps up & running when you set out on your breakfast journey because this place is a little tucked away. Located behind a doctors office in a somewhat empty center, we wondered whether anyone would be home when we got there. Don't let its remote location turn you off though. Once inside, we were greated warmly and seated in a quaint spot by the window. The decor is simple, yet elegant and modern and the service was timely and efficient.   The menu itself was unique to say the least. My craving for breakfast food drew us in, but we quickly switched our focus to lunch when the menu revealed that all their items have an Asian twist to them.   I ordered Papusas and Matthew ordered the Corn Beef Hash. The food was beautifully prepared and the ingredients were fresh, but we came to grub on some good food and unfortunately the meal was better on the eyes then in the tummy.   As pretty as it looked, both meals were rather bland and lacked any sort of distinct flavor. The beef on my papusa was slightly overcooked & therefore a bit dry and its accompanying coleslaw lacked the spice & flavor that typically gives this dish its wow factor.   Matthew's hash was good but not great. The hash itself consisted of a rye bread concoction (or so it tasted) as the hash, and a minimal amount of beef. As a real CBH lover, he was hungry enough to eat it all, but not thrilled enough to come back.   I'd say this place is worth a visit depending on what you look for in a restaurant. If good service & presentation is high up on your list of requirements, check it out. If you're a food connoisseur with a perfect palate, a different breakfast joint might better suit your fancy.",

The chef/owner Matthew Meyer, was humble and gracious enough to take the time and personally check on the entrees and how our experience was. This is a man that takes his work and passion seriously, which, in a city overwhelmed with service options makes all the difference. Sorry for the half-eaten entrees, the food smelled too good to wait. If you're coming for brunch, you NEED to request Troi, he's the only one in this town that understands the True meaning of bottomless mimosas, and made a perfect suggestion for my and my girlfriend's plates as this was our first in a series of return visits.",

Took a look at the menu and found that served Filipino food, which is great since my family is Filipino! The food isn't your traditional Filipino (the way it's served), portions are very large and the dishes are posh. If you're not into Filipino food they also have several traditional breakfast options.   This place was the perfect \"gourmet\" breakfast place to take my mom to for her birthday. All my guests enjoyed the food and service. Our server, Manny was very accommodating and funny! Price was lower than I expected considering I had nine guests.  I will definitely be back again!!!",

Then I don't know if it's the grease they cooked the potatoes in, or the over use of salt.. but yuck! I spit out the potatoes.   Spam & Eggs, eh. It's spam. I like spam, but the dish.. is it worth the amount they're charging it for? No. Again, it's Spam. The Thai butter is a nice touch on the eggs though.   The Chicken wings? Nice taste. Again, worth the price? Probably not. $7 maximum, easily at a local Hawaiian or Korean spot.   Biggest disappointment would probably be the soft shell crab tempura. I heard such great things, and was let down. Would I visit again? Maybe. Maybe not. Wasn't exciting. Inflated pricing that was just \"Eh\" food. Couldn't justify it.",

The potato appetizer was amazing. It was very flavorful and were impressed. When we got our entrees one order was wrong the gave us the spicy pork and the crab not the ribeye.

The bacon had a smokey, maple glazed flavor that was out of this world!!! Everything we ate had such an incredible flavor...will definitely spread the word to family who lives here, and come back when we visit. WOW!!!",

When she returned with water in to-go cups, she took our orders (by memory, didn't right anything down). Our food came out shortly after and sure enough somethings were not right. My eggs were more over-medium then they were over-hard, which is what I asked for... I didn't get the side of avocado I asked for and our drinks never came, NEVER CAME... the food isn't all that great but i guess its tolerable if your hungry... do yourself a favor, stay home and have breakfast.",

    "text": "I rarely leave 1 star especially for a restaurant...ESPECIALLY FOR A NEW LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT!!  However this is exceptional. We entered Served after seeing Kitchen Table had a 45 minute wait. No problem. It's Sunday brunch. Everything's busy. We walk in and it is very small and quaint.  There is a family of 5 waiting at the host stand ( not talking to anyone) and we are behind them. After waiting several minutes with no acknowledgement I walked around the family and walked up to the hostess. She looked at me briefly then turned and began talking to the family. So I went back to the back of the family. After several more minutes the blonde hostess/server ( which by the way is always a great idea) walked by us and said \"it'll be a few minutes\". That is our first sort of interaction.  Okay still no problem. It's busy I understand. Now she walks by again and says \"a few more minutes is it just two\". I said yes she walked away. At this time the family is sat and we are alone up front. Then a few minutes later a couple walks in behind us. I watch as minutes go by and no one acknowledges them either. Finally I hear the man say let's go somewhere else. And they leave ( not a great way to lose business in a competitive industry with a heavy hitter in the same parking lot. It would seem to me that you probably can't afford to lose customers.). Anyways we finally get seated. The waitress (same as blonde hostess) says \" just water?\"  I reply \" yes , and\" she walked away before I could speak. We were ready to order. Waiting a while we looked at the menu and had decided. ( we grabbed our own menus, were not offered). So i was ready to catch her on the water flyby/drop off. Well no chance. She dropped and ran. ( this place has maybe 12 tables with 4 servers and a busser guy). Well we waited and waited.  I made eye contact with many people and the chef/ I believe owner.  Nothing. After about 12 minutes waiting we left. Hungry.... disappointed. Won't be back. Thanks. Great work. Still looking forward to Kitchen Table.",

The last time I went I had the Fried Chicken and Cornbread French Toast. Both were good separate but they were hard to eat together. The chicken was hard to cut with a knife, the easiest way to eat it was by hand so getting it with the cornbread was more work than I was willing to put in. I eventually just ate them separate which was still good but not what I expected. I probably wouldn't order it again.  BUT the items I have loved have been the Crispy Baked Berry French Toast, its the perfect level of sweetness. The Short Rib Benedict is great and The Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict which I know sounds so strange but its SO good! It's definitely my favorite item on the menu, I highly recommend it. I've also had the Apple Pie Tempura pancakes, it was too sweet for me but my sister (who loves sweets) loved it!",

    "text": "Served ? More like waited forever to get served.   This place has great food. I compliment the chef 100% ..   Sadly the service is what gives this place such a low rating, from me at least. Our Server, tall gentleman, had no personality. He wouldn't smile nor did he greet us upon arrival. I'm very observant of my surroundings when I go anywhere, and one thing I did notice was how unfriendly he was towards our table. I noticed him greet everyone else and laugh with certain customers, but he obviously didn't seem to want to extend the same courtesy towards us. Aside from the lack of customer service, our glasses of water, were just that. Glasses of empty water decorating the table. They were rarely filled. Mind you the restaurant was not packed, mayber one or two tables besides ours. At one point my friend asked for a refill and they only refilled the cup half way. Laughable.   Food took forever, waited about 1.5hrs .. At this point more customers had arrived and were fed and on their way long after we arrived, but way before we received our meals ( 4 tables total - I kept track ) .. but we forgive the chef, because like I said, the food was pretty good and he graciously came out to greet and ensure we had received all our entrees and to ask if everything was okay with our meals.   I've worked in the customer service industry .. food/hotel/retail .. for years and I pride myself in ensuring that whomever I am assisting in that moment, that when they leave me, they've left satisfied. ( I've dealt with pain in the ass idiot customers ) but even I've always kept my game face on. And we were far from the closest pain in the ass anything.   I've never left a table without showing my gratitude. Sadly this time I did.   But once more, food was very tasty. The chef knows his stuff (try the tacos, langosina burger and the ono wings) .. and hey maybe our server might like your table, who knows, but for now and probably ever (because I won't be bringing my business back to this establishment) my rating sticks.",

Served sits behind some other businesses off Horizon Ridge so you may not see it from the road. They offer ordinary breakfast items and some items that your not going to find anywhere else. I had the crispy pork belly tacos. they were savory and sweet with the sugar cane vinegar slaw and pickled papaya. Pork wasn't very crispy but still  full of flavor. Served with a side of beans and Thai fried rice.  the other dish I had was the Bi Bim Ba. marinated flank steak, different vegetables that have a kimchee taste with a poached egg and rice topped with hot sauce. A dish I was uncertain about was glad it was something I ordered. Meat was very tender and melted in your mouth and the hot sauce/kimchee combination was perfect with the poached egg on top.  With so many options this is a place that will keep you coming back to try their different creations.",

Everything we ate was delicious and with generous portions. Peruvian lomo saltado got high ratings from a native Peruvian. Corned beef bread pudding benedict was all around favorite dish. Poached eggs were cooked perfectly. Definitely going back next time we are in town.",

Their restaurant has a cute classy family style to it, it's very welcoming, and the waiters and chef are all so friendly.  For drinks, their Mango Melon Juice is fresh made in house daily and is absolutely refreshing. I get it every time I go here.  For breakfast, their Portobello Eggs Benedict or Pork Belly Benedict is so delicious. I don't personally like eggs benedict, but I actually really love theirs.  For lunch, their Ono Chicken Wings was very delicious with a twist to Hawaiian sweet and tasty flavors. The Pork Belly Banh Mi is a fusion to Vietnamese sandwiches and had meat that was very moist. On the lighter side, the Spinach Salad is very simple yet one of my favorites. The Miso Pork Belly Burger is one of their signature dishes and it does not disappoint. As you bite into it, you can see all the juicies bursting out from the burger and it is served with crispy potato nuggets.  Complimentary chips (with a secret seasoning) and salsa are served.  Love the food here, love the service, love the atmosphere, only wish this place opened for dinner!",

And he brought out a nice sample of the BBQ Eel with quail egg on a tiny toast of bread. Perfect combination as well. I'm looking forward to coming back to try more amazing dishes. Great food.

Yesterday, 01.10.19, my choice for lunch was to finally try this place as it is so close to my work.  The service was awesome - very attentive and concerned for us having a great meal experience.  The food was amazingly delicious - I had their breakfast plate and their potatoes are just dreamy.  However, as I was finishing my food a rude woman showed up and was being overly dramatic from the get-go.  She brought in food and demanded a refund - who pays for something, takes it home, and then returns the next day demanding a refund??  I just read the other reviews and it appears that Kahee H, Cindy B, and Chloe E all are complaining about a poor experience on 01.09.19 that they/their friend experienced.  Whichever of the three it was that came back decided to throw the food against a table/wall as she walked out and I spoke out saying \"Real Classy, lady!\".  I have a 15 month-old and a 6 year-old, and my goal in life is to raise them to be better than that.  No one should feel entitled to throw a tantrum like that and it is absolutely embarrassing that any human being would act that way.  Shame on you and shame on your parents for not teaching you better.  THE FOOD AND THE SERVICE ARE DEFINITELY DELICIOUS AND WONDERFUL.  I will continue to come here and refer my family and friends!",

Th Burger itself is a little on the small side, (compared to the classic cheeseburger) but it was honestly perfect for my appetite. The meat was juicy and the burger was stacked high with a knife to hold everything in place.   We also tried a crispy fish taco and the shrimp tempura taco. Both were big in flavor, but I have to say the crispy fish was the favorite.   The Misses ended up getting th classic cheeseburger and let me tell you, it was HUGE! (;P) Paired with the flavorful, crispy potato nuggets and the perfect amount of cheese, this burger was bomb.   We would definitely come back to try everything on the menus.

They bring chips and salsa to the table and both items were outstanding. Fresh homemade salsa and if I had to guess the chips were probably made there also. I ordered the corned beef hash with egg. The waitress told me they quit serving that item at 2 p.m. however she would ask the chef if he would make it. So glad he said yes! Possibly the best corned beef hash I've ever had. My friend had the Miso Burger that came with sweet potato fries. Well, I couldn't help myself I ate all those sweet potato fries. Seasoned perfectly!! I am so keeping my fingers crossed that this tiny restaurant makes it here in Green Valley because the food was simply marvelous.",

I don't know about you guys but that definitely throws me off and puts a bad taste in my mouth before the food even gets there. He didn't make any comments about the menu, didn't ask if we've been in before, didn't take our drink order (another server did), didn't make any suggestions. All he said when we were ready was \"what can I get you?\" Blah.  Anyway, the dishes we got were beautifully plated and delicious! We got the Peruvian lomo saltado and the green eggs and spam. We shared an order or the sweet potato fries. I appreciate the fact that my dish came with a side of vinegar as a dipping sauce lol. I couldn't finish my food but everything was so good. The sweet potato fries were in a tempura batter or something, but they probably made it to my top 5 fries lol. The prices are definitely a little high but I'm guessing it's because the quality of food. I definitely want to come back to give the other items a try.",

The waitresses were very nice, fast, and attentive with great recommendations. To top it off Chef Matt stopped by our table to see how everything was which to me shows they care much about their business to personally check on their customers for feedback.  Cinnamon sugar chips with banana Nutella dip - very good. It was like a fresh made Cinnamon Toast Crunch but way better   Longsilog - Good. Could use a touch of salt for my taste but the pickles on the side went well with it   Soft Shell Crab Eggs Benedict - Amazeballs! Everything was perfectly seasoned. Loved it. Next time I would ask for a little more hollandaise to maybe dip my crab in and mix with my yolk  Side of Green Eggs - Yum! Eggs with a green Thai butter was delicious. Had is nice little kick to it",

I recommend anything pork belly but you can't go wrong with a sandwich or burger.  I came on a weekday and breakfast options were still offered, so I'm not positive what changes for weekend/brunch offerings, but I'm intrigued and would definitely come back to test it out.  I had the I had the Asian BLTA with pork belly and an egg.  Huge sandwich on Texas toast.  Honestly, impossible to eat, but forking and knifing it didn't take away from any of the flavor.  Sriracha it up and you're good to go.  I asked for spicy and it had no heat whatsoever, but it was still perfectly cooked and crispy.  Sweet potato fries were a little salty/underwhelming, but I do like a sandwich that comes with a side complimentary so I can't complain on that.  At Served you receive a full meal so expect to pay about $15 per person at least.  You will be full and content and surprised by the uniqueness and the beautiful presentation of the food.  You will feel taken care of by the staff.  As a restaurant, I also really like the cheap alcohol Happy Hour menu beginning at 2:00pm and the free Wi-Fi.  Give Served a chance for sure if you ever venture to this part of Henderson.",

I have to say I wasn't expecting too much since the place is pretty hidden from street view and relatively small and seriously empty when we got there. But it BLEW ME AWAY!!   Now I forgot our server's name since time passed; but phenomenal service. He was so down to earth, great with giving us suggestions. And totally understandable of our two little ones. He brought out kids cups, extra plates and napkins without us even asking. He even brought my two year old fresh home made cinnamon chips with some bomb Nutella whip sauce to go with it. My kid went crazy over it! My inner kid secretly did too. Haha.   Loaded Potato Nuggets- bomb appetizer. The potato nuggets were nice toasty fried oozing with the toppings. The bacon bits added a nice touch. I recommend sharing between more than two people because I was getting full just from this. It's pretty fried and heavy.  BiBimBop- huge serving and so much galbi! So tender; so delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about it. And the use of colored carrots - nice touch Miso pork belly burger - I can't say much about this, but my husband couldn't stop raving about his burger to me. But his tempura sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious.   I'm going to have to come back and try their brunch and the rest of the menu. The food is pretty pricey, but definitely worth it. If you are ever in the area, there are tons of parking. It looks like a small cafe, but man does the food pack a punch full of flavor.",

The only reason why I didn't rate this a 5 Star was because it took kind of long for the waitress to get us our drinks and take down our order. However, once our order was placed the service was quick! We started off with the loaded truffle Parmesan nuggets which were amazing! It came with a sunny side egg on top and was very tasty! My husband ordered the soft shell crab Benedict (which was the reason why he wanted to try this place out), I got the pork belly Benedict, our son got bacon and eggs and our daughter got the spam and rice. Everything was amazing! The potatoes that come that came with the Benedicts were perfectly seasoned and super yummy! I also got the bottomless mimosas! The guava was my fave!!",

This guy said he would return my wife's and mine hard earned money we gave him only to tell us months later he's only giving us a partial. He didn't even tell us when he first said he'd refund our money that it's only be a partial. Complete snake who's business is begging for every penny.  He's a complete liar and scam artist.  If Matt is doing business in Las Vegas as a caterer he is doing it illegally because his license is expired and when we asked him to pay it up to date he said no. So for him to say he did everything he could to accommodate us is a complete lie. We did everything we could to keep him as our caterer but our venue didnt allow Henderson licensed businesses. OH! And when we told him where, he didn't have the courtesy to say \"hey guys, I'm not licensed there\". To hell with this guy and his bad business ways. I hope his place goes under.",

Troi, our server, truly wanted us to have a positive and fun brunch experience. He cracked jokes and was incredibly attentive - not too much though. Believe me, if you want to do bottomless mimosas here, make sure Troi is your server... trust me.  Free starter of cinnamon/sugar chips and banana/Nutella spread. Creamy! The chips were too addicting, had to push them away. Had to save room for my monstrous brunch!  Here's what we ordered: Green Eggs and Spam, Tocilog, and Barbacoa Benedict. The garlic fried rice was super garlicky with the Spam breakfast. It wasn't as garlicky with the other two; different batch? Eggs and Spam breakfast slightly salty - it's Spam - and the rice portion could've been bigger. Overall everything was four-star.  They understand how to really cook eggs - by the way, eggs that are dry and have no \"run\" to them are over-cooked. Not an opinion, culinary fact!  The pickled papaya ticked the sweet/sour box, the braised barbacoa melted in the mouth, the green Filipino butter on the eggs was a treat, and the poached egg was buttery perfection. I will return to served!",

Bummed out we started looking on yelp for another close by restaurant or brunch, and found served. The hostess was very friendly and seated us right away, we had my toddler and baby with us too so I was i was a little worried we would be squished since the restaurant is a little on the small side but we were seated comfortably.   I ordered the roasted pork belly bahm mi($13) delicious and very spicy. It came with potatoes.10/10  My mom ordered the huevos rancheros, they had a different take on it but they were still really good 9/10. And my sister ordered the crispy berry french toast, I tried it and it was a little too sweet for me but my sister loved it so 10/10'for her. After having the delicious food at served I would say it was a sign that kitchen table was closed.",

    "text": "Served is one of my favorite spots for breakfast and brunch. I would actually be here a lot more if it wasn't located in the boondocks (i.e. Henderson, NV).  Chef Matt is the best and don't be surprised if he leaves the kitchen to check up on you.  He's a really nice man, very generous, and passionate about his customers.  The service from his staff is just as good too.  The menu consist of an American style breakfast with an Islander twist to it.    My Favorites: -The Breakfast Sandwich ($10) - One of the best breakfast egg sandwiches that I have ever had. -The Ono Wings and Rice ($10) -Longsilog (Filipino Breakfast / $10) - 3 eggs, longanisa, & garlic fried rice.   -The BAM Breakfast ($11) - 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 3 eggs, toast, & potatoes.   -Asada Steak & Eggs -The Miso Pork Belly Burger -Chicken Breast ($5) - Not on the menu, but he'll serve it if you ask for it.   Servings are huge and expect to get a lot for your money. Almost everything on the menu is $10 or less.  Nothing is more than $15. Chef Matt has talent, he's very humble, and I recommend Served if you're ever in the area for breakfast/brunch.   Wish List:  Bring back some of the dinner options.  Chef Matt attempted to open for dinner a couple of months ago.  He served dishes ranging from salmon to steak. I had the opportunity to try most of his dinner entrees and all were on point.  The filet mignon with foie gras is amazing and the price was less than $40.  It's just too bad that he ended up squashing dinner.  Filet mignon for brunch?  Sold!!!  2017 Yelp Review #20",

When we got through the door, the waitress greeted us and walked us to our table. This restaurant is smaller and it holds about 48 people. But the way it is set up, it doesn't feel crowded which is nice. Chef Matt also came around to each table to check on how everything is tasting.   The food is kind of like American Asian fusion. They have Asian dishes like filipino longanisa, garlic rice, pork belly, etc. For the American dishes they have pancakes, eggs Benedict, bacon, burgers, etc.   $19: i ordered the miso pork belly burger with sweet potato fries. The burger is huge! You have to open your mouth wide to take a bite. The burger comes out medium rare. The pork belly melts in your mouth and the sweet potato fries are really good.  $13: My little brother got the green eggs and spam. The spams are thick pieces. You can taste the garlic in the rice, without it being to overbearing. $18: My boyfriend ordered the Korean BBQ plate. It was ok. The plate was small compare to the price we paid. The prices are a little bit pricey. The burger was the best thing we ordered out of the three.",

Yelped a couple spots we wanted to check out for brunch and I am SO GLAD THAT WE MADE A STOP HERE AT SERVED. It wasn't packed when we arrived so we got seated right away. Our servers were exceptional. So friendly, so quick, and so personable.   The establishment is small, hip, and very clean. Lots of parking and in a very nice neighborhood. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely be back there to try out the rest of the menu items.   For this trip, I got the longanisa breakfast. Let me tell you... my belly was SO HAPPY. Something so simple, but was so delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend got the miso burger and he loved it. I look at the picture I took and I'm salivating over the thought of their food. You can be adventurous or a little more on the traditional side. Whatever floats your boat.   All-in-all, it was definitely a great experience. No reason for me to give anything less than 5 stars. Excellent job, Served!   Enjoy!",

This particular occasion we dined upon the special that was a prime rib sloppy joe sandwich with horse radish macaroni salad on the sandwich itself.  The truffle Parmesan potatoes on the side were glorious!   This place is truly spectacular and has a great welcoming vibe the minute you walk in.

We were in town visiting from Northern Cali and found this gem tucked away and I can passionately say, the food was not short of AMAZING!! The food we had was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. You first start off with complimentary chips and salsa but it's not just your typical chips and salsa. The chips were uniquely seasoned which only enhanced when you added their wonderful salsa to it. It was soooo good that I could just eat it on its own and walk out satisfied with a huge smile on my face.   On to the main course, my dish was the Turf and Side Benedict which had filet mignon, mushrooms spinach atop 2 slices of sourdough and can't forget the bearnaise sauce. The hubby had a pork belly Benedict which was equally delish! It was accompanied with some potatoes that were cooked with perfection. The whole meal was exquisite with every bite.   A lot of credit to Matt, the chef, who came out to greet his guests and get feedback on his dishes. Something you rarely see and only see at high end restaurants. It shows his concern and passion for the work of art that he creates and brings to your table. Thanks Matt for a wonderful brunch.   There were a lot of mouth watering dishes on their menu that we look forward to trying in the near future. Highly recommend this place to everyone that's in the area. Don't pass off this place cause you will be missing a lot!",

You can also find breakfast basics if you're so inclined to share your breakfast table with basic people who like French toast and things. I have tried the Huevos Rancheros and the Salmon Curry. I HIGHLY suggest the salmon curry. The edges are charred slightly, the rice is delicious and the curry is flavorful but not spicy. This dish is hearty, and has cute little vegetables along the plate. The chef always comes out to ask how your meal is-which is just lovely. They also have fresh squeezed juices. They might even have little secret fruit trees in the back. Not sure. Either way, if you're in the Hendertucky area, check this place out! The only downfall on this place is it's lack of comfort and aesthetic.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying Served has a lot of potential! The delicious food was overshadowed by the subpar service. With a name like \"Served\" you would think they would be stellar in that area. My wife's omelette with home fried potatoes on the side was a 10/10 Unfortunately my Benedict didn't come out for over 10 minutes after her dish.  The home fries had onions and I think bacon mixed in them. They were nice and crispy. My Beef Birria Benedict was outstanding!  To make up for the delay on my entree, the Chef/ Owner gave me a cremation brulee, which was a kind gesture.  I would love to see this restaurant be successful!  Note to the owner: you have the food part down! Now create an atmosphere and level of service to go with it! More upbeat interaction with your guest from all of the staff. The servers should be asking questions and making suggestions on what to order.",

I will say that maybe this was a fluke because all the other dishes coming out looked delicious. Waitress said that this was how the dish was supposes to be and unwilling to admit an obvious failure of a dish. When you have no hollandaise sauce and you have to scoop your eggs out of flavorless soup with a fork, I dont know how you get away with calling that a $17 benedict.",

So I came here around noon on a Saturday, although I'm a little disappointed I didn't get some cinnamon chips because they look tasty. Okay moving on..  So I have the huevos rancheros, but it was made with longanisa. Anyone not familiar will longanisa, it's a sweet sausage that's usually red and served for breakfast. It added a different taste and I'm a fan! Served definitely adds a twist to all of their food.   That being said, some of their breakfast plates seem kind of basic for the prices so I would probably opt for one of their more interesting plates.  The service was very attentive. Our server always kept our water glasses filled. She was very friendly. I'm definitely a fan and will be back to try more items!",

Their curry is also delicious, just spicy enough to feel it, however 25 dollars for the chicken substitution is egregious. A chicken panang curry at even the best Thai restaurants maxes out at 15 dollars, and it's not like they gave us a double portion. I hope the owner takes a look at this and fixes the pricing. Otherwise a delicious place with really nice and friendly service. Im surprised they're not more of a hit in the Vegas area.",

We've eaten close to this establishment before and knew of it from driving by, and also from the Yelp reviews.   We arrived today (Saturday) around 1030'sh. It's a small restaurant, but there were seats immediately available, as opposed to our usual restaurant where we have a 30-minute to hour wait.   We were greeted with warm smiles and our waiter was nice and friendly. So far so good.  The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from. We ordered mimosas and water to start. After speaking with our waiter about what he recommends, we opted for the Barbacoa Benedict and Huevos Ranchero. We waited approximately 10-minutes for our meal.   The plates came out with food looking outstanding. Beautiful and appealing to the eye. Large portions too. Then...we took our first bite....HOLY SH$T. I would've slapped my momma the food was balls to the wall legit, delicious. The Barbacoa Benedict is out of this world. Hands down the best Benedict's I've ever had in my life. Blown. Away. The Huevos Ranchero were ri-effing-diculous. Amaze.   You know that feeling where you're torn between being pissed off because it took so long to find a gem of a restaurant, but it's so f#cking good that you're also ecstatic?!?! Yep. That was today at Served.  The chef and owner also came out while we were eating to check on everyone. Super cool guy who definitely knows his food.  Go here. Eat here. Unbelievably delicious. Going back tomorrow. Cheers!",

My girlfriend and I live anywhere but close to here and we make the trip happily nearly every time we are in Vegas. The chef walks the dining room every twenty minutes or so and seems to check in with every table and actually seems to care whether we like the food! Also have to say Troy our server was great and truly we never saw the bottom of the mimosa's because he's a champ.  We've only been twice so we haven't sampled much of the menu yet, but everything has been amazing and I really don't think you can go wrong. They seem to have pretty much the same menu except they change the style of the items.  Will say food is good and service is great wouldn't have gone out of the way to write a review of Troy wasn't as good as he was",

    "text": "Served is quickly becoming one of my favorite brunch/breakfast places in Vegas. I was almost surprised that they weren't as busy when I called ahead on a Sunday morning. Even so, I can see Served becoming ever more popular based on food alone, and if this place isn't on your list of go-to's for brunch, it should be.  The waiters/waitresses are so inviting and friendly that you feel like you're part of a community of sorts. The chef came out and introduced himself to every table, and I think it's the small things like this that make you want to come back and bring all your friends.  After you order and are just waiting for the food, you get some complimentary snacks. You know how Mexican restaurants give you chips and salsa or how an Italian restaurant gives you bread and olive oil? Well Served goes one step further and gives you cinnamon sugar chips and a Nutella dip. The dip itself is pretty light and gives you just enough of that chocolate hazelnut flavor without feeling like you're dipping the entire thing in a jar of Nutella.   We got the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict and the BAM Slam with blueberry pancakes. The BAM Slam was perfect. The breakfast potatoes aren't your average deep fried/dry potatoes. They have a crisp exterior and a soft, warm interior. They definitely have a heft to them. If you're not careful (like me), you'll eat all the potatoes first, get full, and realize that you still haven't tried the rest of your food. First world problem, I know. The bacon is thick cut and has a little sweetness to it. The pancakes were fluffy and cooked well. The roasted pork belly benedict was really well prepared as well. All the flavors balanced very well.  Overall, the food is incredibly well prepared, the service is amazing, and you most likely won't be disappointed when you come here.",

    "text": "HIDDEN GEM worthy of multiple foodgasms.  I live in the northwest but had an errand near 215 & Easter so pulled my bookmarks and this was close so I stopped in.  It's tucked in the back of a small business center but not terribly hard to find.  Seating area is small but not tiny. Wait staff was friendly, helpful but didn't hover.  They serve breakfast and lunch.  I arrived at 11:30AM perused the menu only to find so many things I would love... but I stuck with what I went there to try.. Pork Belly Benedict.  Egg was perfectly cooked (amazing how many places can't poach an egg correctly!), sauce was flavorful, topped with microgreens, a little something spicy (jalepeno?) and all that on top of a few thick slices of pork belly on sourdough bread.  The flavors were spot on perfect.  Even the side of potatoes were perfectly crisp and hot.  It was so good I ordered the pork belly hogie to go with the intent of giving it to my neighbor.  Ssssh!  It never made it there.  The combination of pork with the pickled veggies was a perfect way to cut the fat... sort of like how Carolina pulled pork uses the apple cider vinegar.  Soft roll, some kind of sauce, a little heat but not much, pork belly, crunchy pickled veggies... once again the perfect combination of flavor.  The only thing I can say wasn't spot on isn't even worth deducting a star.  It's probably just a matter of personal preference.  I found the meatier part of the pork belly a little dry.  I think it's probably braise/roast vs some sort of BBQ or perhaps frozen vs fresh... but with everything perfectly seasoned and a great combinations of flavor, it's fairly minor.  The chef/owner came out to check.  Seemed nice, genuine and interested.  I had just finished eating and was basking the the afterglow of a foodgasm so I didn't really talk as much as I normally would.  The bottom line is I would drive the 25 miles again tomorrow to eat there again... and I might!  it's clear the chef has a great palate or at least compatible with mine!",

    "text": "I've eaten three times at Served, an Asian fusion restaurant, and each time it's clear that this is the food of a gifted, creative chef who clearly invests his love of cooking in his food.    I've had the short rib chili cheese burger, the truffle mushroom burger, and the miso pork belly burger. Each one was fantastic, my only quibble was that the short rib was a tad dry, and my palate is too domesticated for wild mushrooms, but nevertheless I inhaled both burgers rapidly.   The miso burger is sheer perfection, the substantial handmade patty and the marinated pork belly are a sumptuous combination. I've had pork belly burgers where the pork distracts from the beef, but this burger is a harmonious guilty pleasure.   The service was at a high level, it was quick, considerate, and responsive. My coffee and water were quickly refilled. Simply a great meal.",

So I read that this place can get pretty crowded( it does, some people came today but ended up leaving because of the wait time) so I went ahead and placed a table reservation , luckily when we got there a table was ready for us so yay!  Our server was great, he knew a lot about what they actually serve. I got Matt's Omelette and let me tell you this, it was everything I look for in an omelette ! The flavor hit the spot definitely ! And I also tried their blueberry pancake, and that thing was packed with blueberries, good fluffy pancake and not too sweet. Overall this place is a great breakfast/brunch spot , one thing I can suggest though, is we need more \"SMILES\" in this place :)",

Garlic rice was just enough garlic, and the longanisa was juicy.   3. Service by Jaime was great. Just attentive and proper.   What can be improved:  1. Tocino was fatty, bit much for ethnic palette, so Western palette might get intimidated. But flavor was good over all.   2. Plating of corned beef hash. While tasty needs some TLC. BUT still tasty.   3. Restroom needs attention.   4. Ambience. It's clean, but maybe some color.  I'm just being picky.   --------------  Always for the chef trying to push, you can tell he's concerned and wants to be great. Great place overall and would come back. Don't hesitate, try it!",

    "text": "My family and I decided to leave the comfort of our neighborhood and trek 30 minutes to celebrate my mother's birthday at this tucked away gem.   First thing to note is that they recently started serving dinner which was beyond amazing. The food is fresh, flavorful and extremely thoughtful. We were a party of 8 and each of us ordered something different. The steak was well prepared including the burger. My uncle had the enchiladas which he literally devoured in 5 minutes. My dad ordered the tacos with kimchi rice which he said was fresh and nicely spiced. My mother had the shrimp pasta which not only looked stunning but was cooked perfectly.   Now for my dish, I ordered the Kabocha curry with rice and spring veggies. I was stingy and only allowed my mom to have a piece since after all... she's the birthday girl. The curry is fragrant and works well with the tempura fried squash and rice. I also ordered a side of kimchi which I ate on its own.   The service down to the desert and attention to detail really made tonight special. The chef and his staff are exceptionally kind and rounded out our experience. We discussed visiting again for Served's famed brunches.   If I were to describe the cuisine I'd say it's refined, culturally influenced and very thought out. There are menu options for a spectrum of foodies.   Thank you to the chef and his team (I forgot the name of the young lady who ran the door - she's so sweet!!) My mom really enjoyed her birthday!",

I forgot his name but he was so awesome, he was the host , the busser, the server, he was so sweet and just a lovely person. He made my birthday even better. I tried the portobello Benedict and that had to have been the best tasting mushroom I have ever had in my life. It was roasted to perfection as were the other vegetables. It takes a lot to impress someone with some simple veggies but chef did that and more.  My other half had the bacon tempura pancakes and he loved them. The visual for both of these dishes was splendorous. We have been talking about getting takeout from there for a while , but the dine in experience was worth it. The chef came over and greeted the guests , which was icing on the cake.  They officially have a repeat customer  Shout out to the gentleman doing it all and the chef!!",

We ordered the soft shell benedict, french toast, and a bunch of goody stuff and all is exceptional. This is my new go to place evrytime i get here in vegas.

Now I wish I had those 5 months back just so i could have eaten at Served more often. I say this with four dinners under my belt all of which have exceeded expectations. When you are first greeted by the menu it might be intimidating for someone who hasn't enjoyed asian influenced food before, but every dish I have had from the entree section has been the perfect blend of cultures. If you haven't had it yet just try the Pupusa. It is a perfect blend of well seasoned meat, cheese and thick corn tortillas. The other dish I would say not to pass up is appetizer chicken wings. There are enough to be an entire meal with great flavor to accompany.   Most importantly is that on multiple visits chef Matt has come to check on his work which simply adds a wonderful touch to a restaurant that he undoubtedly cares greatly about.  I would recommend Served to anyone who wants great food and great service from a neighborhood location. Don't forget that they can also do take out or delivery!",

We ended up getting kimchi galbi fries as our appetizer.. huge portion!

I ordered the Peruvian lomo Saltado which was pieces of beef, caramelized onions, cherry tomatoes and plantains and topped with 2 sunny side eggs. Delicious stuff!

    "text": "The restaurant is tucked away and unless you were actively looking for it, you wouldn't even notice. I visited with a friend and her kids and they already had a table ready for us as we walked in the door (the server had seen us getting out of the car).  To start our meal, we were served Cinnamon Chips with a Banana Nutella Dip to start and whoa, this was beyond delicious. The chips were light and crispy (there were other seasonings as well, however, I can't remember what they were) and the dip was fantastic. I believe this is served during breakfast/brunch only?  At the urging of another patron, my friend ordered their coffee and it was very tasty! I had found out where they get their coffee, but of course, I can't remember and I don't know where I had seen or heard it. Either way, I've seen people raving about the coffee in multiple reviews, so the coffee is a must.  I like the uniqueness of the menu and the play on classics; that's my favorite type of dishes. So, obviously, there was so much I wanted to try! Even though we were there during breakfast, they still offered their lunch menu (so awesome).  Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict ($17): Fresh marble rye bread pudding, corned beef hash, poached eggs, and hollandaise. I was the most excited about this plate because it bascially combines my favorite foods into ONE MEGA DISH. The bread pudding was a really cool because it was made to be more savory and the rye gave it a nice distinctive flavor. The corned beef hash was very tasty and had a nice crust. The \"benedict\" of poached eggs and hollandaise rounded out this neat combination. The eggs were inconsistently cooked; one was a decent poach whereas the other one was way overdone (no runny yolk). Anyway, this dish was absolutely delicious and something I'd order again! Side note: I just realized the menu says it's served with breakfast potato, but I didn't get anything.  LongSiLog ($13): Filipino breakfast; three eggs, Longanisa (sausage), garlic fried rice, Atchara (pickled papaya), and vinegar sauce. A traditional Filipino breakfast with its own mash-up of a name; Longanisa, Sinangag (fried rice) and Pritong Itlog (fried egg). Though I have experience with longanisa and garlic fried rice, the combination of ingredients and flavors was new to me. The overall flavor profile I got was \"vinegar-y\" and almost sour because of the pickling and sauce. I didn't really love it, but it is a good dish and I'm sure if you grew up with LongSiLog, this is a welcomed comfort meal.",

    "text": "I am a big fan of local small restaurants because we have so few memorable ones in Vegas. Served feels like a small restaurant it's easy to get behind. The chef comes out and asks how the meal was, the service is efficient and friendly and the location is where people live. Not on the strip or downtown. All pluses to me. The food goes bold. In my book that's a big plus. Even if it isn't a perfect result more restaurants need to get more creative. Too many in Vegas go for the boring, easy route.   Having said all that, I felt the vibe of the restaurant as a bit lacking. Maybe if they had a bar with a tv or a brighter decor it would help. It does feel a bit dark in there. But that's a minor criticism.   Coffee is tasty and I tried the soft shell crab Benedict. I think the execution on it was excellent. It has flavor and a good crisp crab. I really enjoyed the Benedict muffin. Tasted fluffy and freshly made. I didn't love the potatoes. A bit mushy. Next time I think I'll ask if they can make them crispier and then those would be perfect. I didn't love the crab Benedict. It was a bit heavy for me. But that could a personal taste, not an indictment of the dish. I want to comeback and try a simpler dish next time. I'm hoping they have turkey sausage or something healthy I can get next time. That's the only way I could come here regularly. Definitely worth checking out!",

My favorite thing to order is the Barbacoa Benedict and the tacos are also awesome, surfside taco is a favorite as well. We would come a lot more often for dinner if it was open a little later but breakfast and lunch are really great! It's a very different style of food and flavor, and hard to describe as there isn't another type of food I can really compare it to, but it never disappoints. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat. Portions are really good size too.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner with some friends and I was surprised that they recently started serving dinner since they usually just do breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I guess I got lucky that time lol. It was kinda empty when I went, but at least that meant we were able to order quickly.  I ordered the salmon togarashi which was pretty good in terms of taste and visual aesthetics. The skin was crispy (very important for me) and the fish was cooked very well. If i had one thing about the dish that was iffy, it would be the hollandaise sauce. Keep in mind that I generally don't like creamy, saucy things, so I am biased. The sauce just felt kind of out of place for the dish and I think it would have been better if they used a different sauce (but I guess they were trying to incorporate some brunch aspect to the dish). I also think this is the first dish I ever had with flower petals (unless it was something else lol). The veggies and mashed potato thing were delicious! I wish they gave me more, but this is a more classy, upscale place so I definitely understand the smaller portion. My friends ordered the salmon curry dish (their only complaint was that it was a little too spicy, but I didn't try it) and the miso pork belly burger (which looked delicious and it was pretty huge).  The overall experience was decent, but I wasn't really blown away. I might consider going here to check out their other items for brunch or something.",

    "text": "I saw this restaurant featured on a local news program and since it was in the neighborhood decided to check it out. First it is difficult to find. It is located in the center of a medical office building center not visible from the street. The GPS said we had arrived so I pulled into the complex and there it was. Parking was adequate but the owner should work with the complex management to get a handicap parking space or two closer to his restaurant. The closest handicap parking spot was in front of a Chiropractor's office quite a distance away. Once inside I found it to be smaller than I expected. Maybe it could sit 30 people max. I did not understand the decor. I suppose it was supposed to be cozy. As for the food choices I have been based in both the Philippines and Hawaii and have traveled all over Asia so was familiar with the menu items although the Chef had his own style dishes. We started off the juice of the day and coffee. I must say this was one of the best coffees I have ever had. I asked our server, Linda, what kind of coffee they served and she said all she knew it was strong. I expected her to say she would ask but she didn't. We ordered our brunch items starting with the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict for me and the wife had the Filipino breakfast. There was a long wait for the food to come. After 15 minutes or so Linda brought some chips and salsa to hold us over while I had my second cup of the excellent coffee. Finally the meals came. The Filipino breakfast was just right with the eggs whites crispy right along the edge the way they are supposed to be. You don't see that detail at most other Filipino restaurants. The Longanisa (Filipino sausage) was just right for me, not too garlic strong as some Filipinos like it. Notably missing were the traditional tomato slices normally served with the typical Filipino Breakfast plate. I like to mix the tomato slices with the garlic fried rice. I found the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict somewhat lacking. They were a little skimpy on the pork belly and it was not crispy along the edges as I expected. Rather just a little mushy. As someone mentioned in another review the bread was hard. If you like this type of dish I would highly recommend the Kailua Pig Benedict at Babystacks. In fact I would recommend Babystacks way over Served for menu selections (many more selections) and taste for this type of food selections. Lastly we ordered the Berry Baked French Toast for a sort of desert and to take home for later after tasting. It was stated on the T.V. review takes two days to prepare this dish. It is made from bread pudding cut into squares and fried as French toast. To me it was a big disappointment. It was served on a long plate as small squares. But as you removed what was supposed to be slices of French toast they fell apart and what you got on your plate was a pile of bread pudding with berries. Again, Babystacks far exceeds Served for this type of dish. I would maybe return to try other menu selections but for now prefer Babystacks for more selections at a lower cost. Another overlooked spot for Filipino-Hawaiian dishes is Thelma's Filipino Foods in Henderson. More of a point-point fast food place but excellent authentic Filipino-Hawaiian dishes.",

Although we came at noon on a Sunday, the place was dead.  I can see why.  The servers were very helpful and the service from them was good.  Like the other yelpers posted, the owner/chef walks around to ask if the food is good or if we need anything else.  I replied, \"Actually, yes.  The eggs Benedict does not have much hollandaise sauce.  May I have a little more?\"  He said yes, disappeared in the kitchen, and never came out.  After 20 minutes, we finished and left.  Why bother asking if you're not gonna do it?  I ordered the soft shell crab benny. The crab was not seasoned and lost in a lot of batter. The hollandaise amounted to a little drip.  I could honestly not taste it. That's why I asked for more.  However, the eggs were poached perfectly.  Anyway, next time I'm in the mood for brunch, I'd rather go to Kitchen Table down the block, which has similar food and more flavor.",

    "text": "TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. I find it ironic that the name of the restaurant is \"Served\" when that is anything but what we got. I will start by saying that I was hesitant about going originally because I thought the prices were rather expensive for a local breakfast/lunch restaurant. However, based on the good reviews, we decided to try it.   First thing to note upon walking in is that the decor and ambiance was a complete eye sore. The host seated us almost right away which then turned out to be our server as well. Drinks were ordered and served quickly. After a few minutes of reviewing the menu, we did have a question about the half portions. While asking about the half portions, the server began answering the question and then walked away while in the middle of explaining because he saw people coming in who needed to be seated.   After a few more minutes, we placed our order. About 15 minutes passed and we began wondering when our food was going to come out. The server approached our table and asked what it was that we had ordered. This was a little concerning after we had placed our order 15 minutes prior. We reminded him of our order and continued to wait for our food. Another 15 minutes passed and no update on our food or what was going on. There were a total of 5 tables seated in the entire restaurant. A couple that came in 15 minutes after we arrived already had their food being served. Tired of waiting and with no explanation of what was going on or attention to our table considering the low volume of customers at the time, we decided to walk out. I work in the service industry and I can say that this was extremely poor customer service and organization.  If you are going to have high end food prices, at the very least, the guest is to be provided with their correct order in a timely manner with exceptional customer service to justify the prices. We received none of the above and decided to walk. No desire to return.",

    "text": "I had brunch with some girlfriends on Sunday. We had waitress that was young, seems to be new at her job and was kind of all over the place. We didn't have silverware from the beginning; had to ask the chef and he brought it to us. She served us all room temperature water w/no ice. When we were closing out our bills, she originally came to by friend and was telling her about the mistake she made on my card. After telling her it's my card, she explained to me she charged my debit card $35 for my bill and $80 from a different table. She was very apologetic for the mistake she made and let me she cancelled it. I wanted to know how long it would take for the cancel because now I don't have the funds available I need. For me in that moment, I couldn't fathom how she was nonchalant she about the $80.00. As if, its not almost $100 charge pending in my account and I now don't have the funds available for my appointment soon after. The manager came over explaining again like its not an issue and it would will be available because it was cancelled. After, I pleaded my case. He gave me $50.00 cash (not $80.00 as he said in the reply to my friends post) for my troubles. If we, didn't say anything they wouldn't have done anything. My friend wrote a comment on yelp regarding her/our experience at this restaurant and in returned we were called \"ghetto\" and picking on a new business. This is so offensive to all of us because we are all beautiful, proud, minority woman of god. We are all educated, hard working citizens with careers. But, automatically stereotyped because we're minority woman. Jokes on him because we came with money to spend and tips to give for good service. But, due to the lack of 5 * service, management skills and training- we are now \"ghetto\". All in all, the food, mimosa's were amazing and the chef/owner was awesome. However, the manager  Manny and the young waitress need more training on how to deal with paying customers. I would also recommend bring cash because you'll be the \"ghetto\" customer that is picking on a new business because their not seasoned in the line of work their in. I came from The Kenwood Inn & Spa-  5* resort/restaurant/spa in Sonoma Country, CA (wine country baby) . I know about top notch customer service and that is the Chef. Unfortunately, he cant run a business by himself. Note to Chef- get a new manager for upfront he's bad for business and replying to these reviews.",

Thank goodness they knew to sit us in the back so the kids could continue to be little monsters while we ate in peace. I enjoyed the space of the restaurant and how the tables were situated. The length of the place created a consistent flow of air from entrance to exit that even being a bit warm, the fans kept everyone cool. Every meal that landed on our table was cooked to utter perfection. Both for the eyes and our mouths. First visit I ordered the green eggs and spam, with the the caption \"thai butter\" reeling me in. The thai spice added to the egg was beyond words. Matched with the garlic rice it was orgasmic. Just about everyone at the table ordered some form of pancake and their plates made my own mouth water. Second visit we went for burgers and fish tacos, both of which were complete perfection. Not sure I've tasted a better burger than my roomate's but theirs just oozed mouthwatering taste. Going to try getting through the menu--wish us luck!",

I had a BLT with avocado.  I didn't count but there must have been 8-10 pieces of bacon and the heirloom tomato was amazing.  My wife had salmon tacos which were just terrific.  We had chicken wings as an appetizer.  They were with a somewhat asian flavor and without a doubt the best I've ever tasted.  (Of course, this is my reaction to most of what I've been served, at served).",

It's in the middle of a plaza and the sign isn't flashy, so it can easily be passed on for Kitchen Table which is on the other side of the plaza and a popular place for brunch foods. It looks like they serve a variation of breakfast foods with some Filipino influences and some Japanese and Korean flavors added too, so it's like an Asian American breakfast type of place. When I went the carpets were really dingy, but based on recent pictures, it seems like they've re-floored the place so it should be much nicer now.  I got the corned beef hash and the miso pork belly burger. Expect to get a box to go because the portions are massive and the foods are so heavy, you'll want to save it for a 2nd round. The pork belly was fatty and flavorful, I had a great time chewing into it and eating my burger piece by piece. The hash is really tasty, and tastes like your standard, salty hash, but I mixed it in with my burger and it was really fun to eat.  The service staff is nice and there was no wait when I came in to eat. If you're into breakfast places, this is a good restaurant to start.",

We ordered app called pork lumpia (was good), and i got the pork belly, and she had chicken Adobe. There was only one other couple in the restaurant. My potato was cold, and seemed liked it was the end of the bag (yes i know it's chopped \"fresh\" potato) but, my point is it looked like it was sitting out in a bowl for a while and all they did was reheat it. I enjoyed my food and i said \"nothing was wrong\" because i was hungry. My girlfriend food she barely touched it she had like 2 bites. Our server came by and asked if we wanted a box i said no thank you she didn't like it at all, she said it was weird... next thing you know she brings our check and still charges us for the Adobe. I write on the check and say \"please still charge me but if somebody didn't touch it and i said it was weird why charge them\"... the server came to the chef,   Chef took it off. Then NEXT THING chef asked the OTHER couple hows the food, he never came to our table to ask us, what was wrong, is there anything he can do to change our experience??....i ended up tipping her good because i do appreciate the little things, i should've never because she seemed so upset about my note.",

Tasted fresh and the seasoning is great. Would be happy with just a basket of those...or bowl...or huge container lol. I ordered the pupusa. Oh wow! I've never had one before and these were amazing. Topped with braised beef, slaw and over easy eggs. It was delicious. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito. Huge burrito, only ate half. His only critic was the contents weren't mixed so some bites were just egg and tortilla. Otherwise he enjoyed it. We also got a side order of crispy potatoe nuggets based on the pics on here. So worth it. They're like breakfast potatoes/home fries but way better. They are crispy and delicious. Not overly cooked but a nice crunch on the outside and the inside is still soft. Definitely order those.   The chef/ owner even came out and asked how the food was. We didn't realize it when he came out he was the owner too. Hope this place does great bc the food is really great and the prices aren't bad.  Good luck Served!",

    "text": "I came into Served having no expectations or desires beyond a hot plate of calories to burn after a long drive up from LA. Instead, I found delicious, gourmet quality food at a decent price. There is a normal wait for the food to be cooked, so if you're used to microwaved stuff you may get antsy, but it's quick in relative terms. The servers are very nice, down to earth people, and my waitress Jamie always made sure my glass was full and I had everything I needed.   I went from having a terrible day and an equally terrible headache to feeling content and relaxed, the bahn mi I ordered was perfect, succulent and crispy pickled vegetables balanced with the juicy, incredibly tender pork belly. The only thing I would change is adding a bit more cilantro, but I'm the kind of person who really likes cilantro.   If that wasn't enough, the chef and owner Matt came out to ask me how I liked it, and he was very friendly. But what impressed me even more was his 4-5 year old son holding the door for me on the way out, even while taking a box outside for his dad. Clearly Matt knows how to raise children as well as he cooks, and the overall experience at Served shows his dedication to making a great dining experience. I'm glad I just moved in next door and I'll probably be eating here every day now!",

Went with 3 friends yesterday to celebrate a friends birthday and were very surprised how yummy it was...all 4 of us really enjoyed our meals.  They have vegetarian and non vegetarian food. Check their hours...I don't believe they are open for dinner...yet. Will absolutely go again.",

The pancakes were good, the potatoes tasted like they were reheated and the egg had a very strange case to them the chef was kind a messed to remake them for us however they still tasted weird we couldn't eat them. The bacon was good it was cut in some type of brown sugar",

The berry French toast was incredible along with huevos rancheros - the green salsa was amazing! The personal touch is what put this place above all others! Ordered my dish w/out beans and the chef brought me some on the side, personally, suggesting I try a bite. He wasn't pushy, just passionate about his dish! He was right...they were great! Also had the papusa on suggestion and that was a dish of incredible flavor and different from anything else I've ever had. This place is a must try!  Ask for Joe the server!",

Granted, I only ordered a breakfast item which was the longsilog, it still very much reminded me of a traditional homemade meal in a more gourmet presentation. Thank you for a delightful meal and service!",

It was also nice to see the chef come out to see if you're enjoying the food. Some nitpicks: the food was warm and I always like it served hot. Also, it was a bit pricey for what I got. However, I may try them again since there were several things I would like to try.",

    "text": "We we found Served on Yelp while we were visiting Las Vegas for the weekend. It was about 6 miles from our hotel, but worth every bit of the drive. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile and the staff was extremely friendly. Then we started with the food.  They brought toasted  bread with a pesto spread that was delicious.  From there it got even better... The pork belly burger was amazing!!!!  The best burger I've ever eaten.  We also had the pork belly fried rice and the Wellington burger.  Every bite put a smile on our faces (and we can be tough critics).  The meal was so incredible we had to have their desert which was a berry bread pudding.  We would highly recommend this restaurant and the staff that they have working here.  The Chef came out to greet us and ask how our meal was, which is unusual these days.   Wish this restaurant was in San Diego as we loved the entire experience and will definitely come back again.   Go visit... you will not be disappointed!",

What we didn't know, is that our meal would be gourmet presentations and a collection of fresh flavors that just melted in your mouth. The Apple pie pancakes could fill 3 adults, the berry French toast was amazing covered in and around with enough healthy naturally sweet berries to give a weeks worth of antioxidants. The staff were professional polite and genuinely wonderful.",
