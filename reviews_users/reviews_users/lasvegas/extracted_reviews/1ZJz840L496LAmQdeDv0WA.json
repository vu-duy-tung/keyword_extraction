I got my usual order, a carnitas burrito. I like carnitas above all things because it is juicy and flavorful. This carnitas was the opposite of that. It was chunks of meat (at least they didn't cheap out and skimp?) that had no flavor. None whatsoever. How is this possible? I don't know. I ate about half, then just ended up taking the meat out as I went to make it somewhat palatable. I finally went inside to look for some hot sauce and there was nothing out...no salsa, no sauce, nothing. So I had to ask the cashier for some and I think she gave me 2 of those small cups. This wouldn't have been a problem except it was the only thing giving the burrito any flavor and I went through the 2 little cups in about 2 bites. At least that was spicy, to drown out the flavorlessness of the rest of the burrito.  My sister also had a weird dish with no flavor. I can't remember what it was and I doubt she could either.  There are other places to eat literally across the courtyard from here. Don't waste your time on this mediocrity.",

It reminded me of the Mexican food they have in Tucson, AZ. Which is a huge compliment cause Tucson is almost in Mexico location wise.   I got the vegetable torta and it was AWESOME. It's not what you typical led expect because the bread wasn't fried and was more like a pocket they put all the fixings inside, but it was so so good! The tacos, guac, chips, salsa... You name it, it was great.  The place is small and definitely a hole in the wall, but thats what I look for when I'm trying to spot good street food. Take a chance on this place, it's fantastic.",

The dish also comes with chips and fresh salsa on the side. The food was good, the only problem is that you dont always get a table as they have a very limited patio space. The menu was also a bit overwhelming and hard to read.  Overall, a very good place to eat Mexican food without breaking your bank.",

Bonus!  - They make a lot of their items from scratch, including their guacamole and re-fried beans. Yummy!  - Location. I get to eat in peace while I watch my boys play in the tree house. Yes, both kids, my toddler and my boyfriend.  - They bring the food to you. I'm sure we've sat at a very far table to see an eye on my son. But they spotted the order number stick thingamabob every time...and fast!  So Pinches has my vote. Their food is what I look forward to when we decide on visiting the park.

I saw some lady with an elote so I came here, and waited almost 20mins in the line.  The price is 3.95, which to me is a little steep. The corn itself seems steamed, and I'm used to the grilled or boiled. It was prepared with your traditional fixings.. I think... mayo, cheese, and chile. To me the taste was super bland and for the price it was not worth it at all.   It may be because I'm used to the legit eloteros, they slather it with high cholesterol! I mean, butter, mayo, queso, and some tajin. This place fell hella short... the 2 stars is again based off the corn.  Customer service is just ok, the guy gave me crap about the part of Mexico I'm from and I wanted to show him what we do to people who run their lip in my area :)  I may come back to try their other offerings... or I can just go to my kitchen and make it myself, but it will actually be delicious.",

Got my kids the enchiladas, which come in 3 (so small too!!! more like size of rolled tacos) we were all still starving at the end! the portion sizes are so skimpy and not even worth how much they charge. Our total for a carne asada burrito, the enchilada meal, and 2 soft drinks came out to $30 almost $31!!!!! That's f'n ridiculous!!!!!!!! Definitely not coming back here! You can find REAL Mexican food elsewhere that's cheaper and taste 10x better! Sorry  Save your money! Not worth it! Only gave 2 stars just to be nice",

We are staying at the Golden Nugget and it was only about a 10 minute walk down Fremont Street to the location which is inside a very nice area called the Downtown Container Park.  This location houses cute boutiques, novelty shops and dining.  Let's continue with the Good.  The food.  It is a walk in and order go find a seat kinda place.  We walked in both I and my girlfriend ordered the 3 taco plate with rice and beans.  We each got the two chicken and one carne asada tacos.  Both of our meals were very tasty and as I mentioned came with rice, beans and chips.  The chicken was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The carne asada was delicious with minimal grissle like other places have.  My date is very picky about Spanish rice, but she loved there's.  Me, I am picky about my Frijoles and these were the perfect blend and seasoned well.  The chips were very good, thick, hot and crunchy.  Price.  Wow!  Was only $9.50 per plate.  Great bargain especially for Vegas over priced food.  Would go back again and again.  The Bad.  When I was done I hungered for more......don't want to be a piggy.  The Ugly.  Nothing ugly about this place and location.  The atmosphere was very family friendly with music playing and entertainment all around.",

The Pastor tacos were ok but I've had better at hole in the wall taco shops around Vegas.  Didn't get to try the Carnitas tacos since we only ordered one and my +1 ate it before I could try.  I like the huge menu they had inside.  I wouldn't mind trying the other items on their menu, they also have a \"Gringo\" menu for those who like Ground Beef in their tacos etc...they will bring out the food to your table which is nicer than having to wait around for your name/# to be called.",

Also i think we over paid. Combination plate was $9.95 + .50 more for asada. My husband had a asada burrito and also just ok ($10.45)  Horchata drink was good. $3.00. Will not be coming back.",

I had to knock off one star for inadequate serving sizes (way too small) & another star taken off for stale tortilla chips.  The chips tasted a day late & a dollar short.

    "text": "I'm not sure if I'm easily pleased when it comes to Mexican food, or if this place is really that good... I'm going to say that it really is that good for the three main reasons that makes any restaurant good:  1) The food - it's not good, it's GREAT. I've only been here twice and both times I had a burrito instead of tacos. I had one of the pork and the asada (beef). It was very more-ish! In my opinion, the perfect size for a burrito so you're not left with a heavy brick in your belly and carb crash shortly after. It comes with a side of chips and salsa with just the right amount of kick.  2) The service was friendly and fast. The first time I was there, it was for a late lunch and the food was out in about 5 minutes. The second time I was there, it was during peak lunch time and there was a line that quickly moved, the food arrived at our table between 5-10 minutes. Both times, the people behind the counters were friendly, approachable and gave good guidance in what to order.  3) The atmosphere was relaxed and it was the perfect outdoor lunch during a warm winter day. There's seating inside and outside, I sat outside on the patio where there were ample tables, chairs and heaters. With the warm (not hot) winter sun kissing my skin and my burritos, I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. I will say that the inside seating was a little sparse, due to the size of the stores in the Container Park, but I believe they made good use of the space that they had.  I'll be eating my way through their menu in the coming months... or maybe weeks... ok, honestly, it'll probably be days :)",

I had the al pastor burrito, I wish I could say more but it just wasn't exceptional or enough for me to remember in detail how to describe it. It was smaller than what was expected for the $10+ I paid for the burrito and a drink, it came with a couple and by that I mean maybe 5 or 7 chips on the side. The habanero salsa had a good kick and flavor, that may have been the best part and that they had fresh brewed ice tea. Maybe I should just expect to pay that much since it is in the \"new\" area of downtown? Maybe I am just spoiled and expect authentic mexican food at a reasonable price... either way it just did nothing for me.",

For $10.50, I got the taco combo with 3 tacos of my choosing and a small side of rice, beans, and a handful of chips. To be frank, the tacos are tasted very similar. I got the El Pastor, Pollo, and Carnitas. The pollo was a little too bland.  Don't get me wrong, it hit this East Coaster's spot, and eating outside in the sun was right on, but I wasn't blown away. Maybe I should have gotten a beer with my lunch!",

Pinches Tacos was my second food choice at the Container Park after Cheffini's POS system crapped out. Pinches Tacos is located right next door to the aforementioned hot dog place, and they offer an array of basic mexican foods like tacos, burritos, and other standard Mexican food menu items. I went with the Adobada Tacos and an order of Flautas to share wth the table. The Adobada was pretty good, great seasoning with a light crunch, plus the addition of pineapple added that sweet factor that's common with marinated pork. The Flautas were ok, but I mostly tasted the fried tortillas and the guac that covered them. The table liked them, but I would have preferred more filling.   The wait to order food and the wait to get it was brutal, it was at least a ten-minute wait to order and another ten plus to get it delivered, not sure if that's the norm, but it wasn't the best.   As for the menu using the words \"Fakeixcan,\" \"Pinche Gringo Menu,\" and the \"Estiffy\" taco is super corny, but I'm sure the soccer moms who rage here love it.",

Staff was friendly, but food did take a very long time and I saw other people being served that came after me with big orders.  They really should move to a bigger space. The  drink machine right behind the cash register is very cramped.",

We tried the Al Pastor (Slow broiled marinated pork), Asada (Grilled Angus beef), Carnitas (Citrus scented pork), Adobada (Grilled chili marinated pork), and Pollo (chicken).  The tortillas were smaller than your typical taco shells, you can tell they are homemade. The Carnitas were our favorite, the other meats were just so-so. The Adobada only came with 3 chunks of pork. Tacos all come with cilantro and onions unless otherwise specified.  The taco plates sounded like a good deal with three tacos of your choice (seafoods are extra), rice and beans, with a side of chips. The chips turned out to be a few tortilla chips on top of the beans, the rice and beans each filled their own tiny sectional of the divided paper plate.   We also ordered the chips with salsa and guac. The salsa was made with fresh tomatoes, onions, and cilantro, but had an odd sweet taste. The guacamole was delicious, and had that chunky avocado texture that I typically crave in a good guac.  It was $21.51 with tip, so decent eats for the price. The staff was very friendly, and they offered indoor and outdoor seating.  It's not that it was bad, it's just that we've had better tasting tacos at home.",

But I'm rarely on this side of town when the sun's coming up, so the b-fast menu wasn't available when I stopped by.  Opted for a couple of different menu items with different meats- the sopes were  little underwhelming, but the tacos were large and meaty for the price. I appreciated that they had lengua available, despite it not being listed with the other meats on the menu. Maybe it's only around as a trial, as the texture was wonderfully soft and tender but the flavor just wasn't that great. The carnitas were a little better, but again, not great. Food was comfortingly homestyle though.  I dig the location, the art on the walls, and the table cards. I've heard good things about this place but I guess I didn't order well. I'll have to come for breakfast next time.",

I had a shrimp burrito with spicy shrimp and coleslaw in the burrito.  It was wrapped together in a homemade tortilla that, I swear but could be wrong, was lightly grilled to seal it up.  On my plate was homemade salsa. When I say homemade I am meaning sometime today maybe even fifteen minutes ago homemade.  The salsa was so fresh I though the tomatoes would get up and dance.  I scooped up that succulent salsa with homemade chips.    I had a bite of a chicken mole burrito.  It was so rich and creamy!  The savory taste wafted up from the fresh tortilla.  I don't really like mole but I was loving this.   This is worth every penny and every second you must wait to stare down at the piping hot masterpiece in front of you.  Get in your car now!  Go now!  Take everyone you know with you.   There is no way you can beat this Mexican food.  Thanks Pinches for a wonderful experience!",

The menu is quite extensive, boasting a number of tacos, breakfast items, combo plates, sopes, burritos, tortas, taquitos, flautas, enchiladas, soups and sides. There's also a beverage menu that includes cocktails and agua frescas.  We came by one evening, though it was close to closing time so we decided to come back another day so that we wouldn't impose ourselves on the staff who were likely ready to go home by then.  When we returned two days later, we were excited, as we'd seen all the offerings on the menu. My husband decided to order two fish tacos and one nopal taco. I opted for one fish, one nopal, and one pollo mole. Our order came quickly and looked absolutely delicious.  The reviews here about the fish tacos are not wrong; they were incredibly delicious! Topped with slaw and a slightly spicy red salsa, the taco is flavorful. (In fact, the fish tacos alone sway this from being a 1 star review!) The nopal tacos came topped with cotija cheese, but the filling was cold which I did not expect. The pollo mole taco came topped with a red salsa and cotija cheese. While pretty flavorful, there was something slightly off about the taste.  Then, within 6 hours of eating here, I experienced some of the worst food poisoning I'd had in years. The only thing my husband and I could pinpoint, that we'd eaten different from one another all day, was the pollo mole taco. I was very disappointed, as Pinches was one of the places I'd looked forward to visiting even before we arrived in Las Vegas!",

The tacos are amazing and they make everything when you place your order.  The taquitos are equally as good.  The guacamole is some of the best I have ever had.  If you are able to head there for breakfast DO IT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.  Have the chilaquiles, I don't even have words for how good it is.",

    "text": "Probably a little on the low end on the scoring here but it's the first taco spot I had after going to Cabo and I didn't find it that great since I was craving that authentic Mexican. I had the pinches combo with a carne Asada, al pastor, and a carnitas taco. Carne Asada was hands down the best, carnitas were a little dry and al pastor was lacking flavor. It came with beans, chips and rice and the chips were the best part of this meal and one of the best chips I've had in a while. Followed it up with elotes and while I'm not a huge fan of corn, I would give it a thumbs up for corn lovers to chow down on coz it's pretty decked out with some lemon juice, mayo and chilli powder! I washed it all down with a horchata and that was really good too so overall decent spot and price is ok for being at the container park.",

Only reason not giving 5 stars is the counter ordering always seems a little disorganized and they seem to always make you wait even when it's not crowded and though there are like 6 people behind the counter.",

I really like to go at night because the container park becomes 21+ which means that there are no children running around, also there are only 2 indoor tables, so make sure you go on a pretty day since they have plenty of patio seating.  This place has my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas. The favors are pretty authentic, the staff is super friendly, the prices are very reasonable and of course, the food is amazeballs.  If you go for breakfast, try the Chilaquiles. If you go for lunch, anything will do. I've had their enchiladas, flautas, tacos, etc. Everything is always great.  You can't really leave the place without trying their blood orange margaritas, let me warn you though, THEY WILL MESS YOU UP! I am not kidding, those are not weak at all!  Some others of my faves are: Horchata, Elotes, Churros",

They have a combo platter served with your choice of three tacos with rice and beans and a few tortilla chips for $9.50. Dish is slightly more for asada. You can chose from several meats like AL pastor, pollo, fish, asada, and even veggie. Meat portions inside the tacos are very filling. Surprising from these little corn tortillas.  My favorite flavor from my meat choices was the pollo mole. Had a nice sweet spicy taste that I really enjoyed.

However,  the seating outside  was more spacious and allowed me to take in the atmosphere of the Container Park. They give you a table placard to take with you when you order and dine outside. It makes it easy for them to bring you your order.  The food was delicious and and prepared quickly . I had the Carne Asade Fries.  The portion was huge and the fries we're perfect.  My friends tried tacos which we're packed and looked delicious. The margaritas pack a punch.  They definitely  sneak up on you! The price on the food for the portion sizes was fair.

The music added to the Mexican atmosphere, if that's what they were aiming for. The inside of the restaurant is very cramped, so it's good that there is outdoor seating.  Service: Not bad! The menu is huge, size-wise and variety-wise. The servers were nice to me as I ordered my food. They handed me a stand with a picture of a calavera, which I thought was pretty neat. Having this meant I knew that they would come give me my food and wouldn't have to pick it up in the cramped indoors.  Food: Authentic and enjoyable Upon getting my food, it was hot, hot, hot! The foil wrapping my burrito conducted the heat from the beans really well, and upon biting into the burrito I got, the food was steaming! The beans actually tasted like authentic, made with lard and proper seasoning. My burrito was hot and delicious, although waiting for it to cool would not have hurt. The chips and pico de gallo were fresh and tasted adequate.  Overall: Indeed Real Mexican food made by Real Mexicans Worth a visit for some good Mexican food. The food is tasty, the service is timely, and the location is awesome.",

Also the lady taking our order was so nice. I love the loteria theme they have super cool!",

With it being $5.75 for this I expected a lot more than what was given and this impacted my experience a lot. I would not recommend ordering this because it is not worth it.   The al pastor was ok, but I like taco y taco better but that's just my preference. Try it, you may like it!   The Mexican corn on the cob was awesome! I would recommend ordering this. Very tasty and yummy.",

There are several tables inside next to the kitchen and more seating on a deck outside as well. It's a great spot to enjoy tacos on a nice day.   The street tacos were so good. I was in love at first bite with my carnitas taco. The tortilla was freshly made and definitely not a packaged product. On top of the tender carnitas there was plenty of pico, cilantro, and onion. We also enjoyed taquitos that were served with plenty of delicious guacamole. They won my heart with the street taco, but the rest of the group was won over with the taquitos.   For Container Park I thought their pricing was very reasonable. The tacos are only $2/$3 a piece which I thought was inexpensive.",

He wasn't necessarily impressed with the dish. Since I'm not that adventurous I'll take his word on the tongue. The food had a decent heat but not as much as I usually like.

First time I had:  -Pinches Combo which consist of  3 street tacos with our choice of meats (I choose Carne Asada).  Served with Rice, Pinto beans, and some chips -Cheese Enchiladas -Mexican Corn  The second time:  -Tostadas -Mexican Corn -Side of Rice  The tostadas are so fresh, and the crunch of the corn tortilla was legit!  So yummy, and they were not stingy with the carne asada.. The corn, well it is just mouthwatering, and I crave it all day!!!  Perfect flavors.  Sometimes Mexican corn can be too much, but they get it right every time...  Overall, my experience there has always been awesome!  Prices could be a little cheaper, but you can't put a price on authenticity..  The workers make it feel like your walking into their home kitchen.    I love that it's in container park as it's an amazing place to be.  Last night, I felt like I was somewhere else, almost like a mini Pike Place in Seattle or Pier 39 in San Francisco (without the water of course) .  Its a perfect combination of Urban meets Art Gallery...",

Also, the meal came with a side of very few tortilla chips and enough salsa for two chips (no exaggeration).",

I think he was a rep, hell maybe even  a manager at the LA location. my husband who is full blown Mexican struck up a conversation with him and he told us how this place differs from others in the area. One reason being the \"Not Nacho's\" I asked why they are called that and he said \"well, what do people think of when they think of nacho's?\" A little dumb founded I paused for a while and he said \" chips with processed cheese on top\" I realize this place is also a chain in LA with plenty of Mexicans so what makes him think that's what people think Nacho's are? I know I don't think that and I'm white. So what \"people\" is he referring to? Get a life bro, your tacos suck compared to REAL tacos at Tacos El Gordo!!!!",

    "text": "A Friday afternoon lunch by myself away from work landed me at Pinches.  I had heard and read the upheaval regarding the name of this establishment and needed to stop by at least once to see it in person. It is in the Container Park, which was nice enough, but considering I was on a lunch break and I just wanted to eat I was pleased to see there was not much of a line outside PInches (which, by the way - does not have its actual NAME on the restaurant).  The place is cramped, to put it lightly. However, the menu board is bright with neon colors chalked on. Select from tacos (of course), burritos, and even Mexican breakfast items. I will be back for you chilaquiles.  You walk up the line and finally get to the cash register and are unceremoniously cramped against people attempting to get to the ONLY soda fountain in the entire place. The place is just entirely too small. But, I ordered an al pastor burrito, with no cilantro, and a small drink, made my way out of the cluster-F of people and sat at one of the two tables they have to the side inside the restaurant.   Al pastor burrito - comes with meat, beans, salsa, and rice. Meat was not super tasty the way al pastor should be. I was disappointed. Taco y Taco has better al pastor by a long shot. However, burrito was nicely done, ingredients dispersed. You get what you get - and guess what? This place is in a touristy destination, it's a tiny place, and you can't see the meat they're using rotating beautifully, being sliced before your eyes. So - there ya go.   It is not bad, nor is it great. There are plenty of places around town you can get AMAZING food like this (and probably for less). I would suggest one of the many places on Charleston Blvd.  Anyway, I'll probably be back during another of my lunch breaks for the chilaquiles. If those are any good, the review may change.",

The most tender carne asada, and moist carnitas.  All the chips/tortillas/sopes are made fresh by hand, which you just can't beat. When you think about the quality of the food, the price is right on point. The fact that they serve elote is unique and has to be one of the best \"snacks\" in Container Park!! Yum. Yum. Yum.  The service is excellent, and it is very likely they will remember you upon return. Real Mexican food from real Mexicans, right here in beautified (in process) Downtown Las Vegas.",

We love Mexican food so we were pretty stoked on it.  I got the carnitas taco combo plate.  I was not happy with it at all.  I love the simplicity of street tacos, but that means the meat needs to be seasoned properly!  The pork was so bland!  And they don't give you enough salsa to make it taste better.  The corn tortillas were soaking wet so I couldn't even pick them up and eat them like a taco.  I looked like a real gringa using a fork.  The beans were also extremely under seasoned.  I'll probably just go to the BBQ place next door if I'm ever over there again.  Sorry!",

Even used the word Sir, that says a lot about who's getting your food. Good job!  The burrito was a lot fresher and lighter tasting than most Mexican restaurants. The chicken was lightly marinated, moist and tender. The tortilla was also soft and moist with no dry ends.\"Rare\"  If you're into spicy heat, ask for the hottest salsa they have. It's kind of like an extra hot version of Ranchero salsa.  I've read reviews that complain about portion to price ratio. True the portions are not traditional American Plate crowding portions. But they are pretty close to the portion sizes of other Mexican places in the freemont area. And in my opinion this food is a lot fresher and close to home made taste than the rest.  Will be eating here again in the very near future.",

That one included chimichangas, tacos that had lettuce, sour cream, etc.  I had elotes, two tacos, and some chips and salsa. The chips that they used were delicious! You can tell their tortillas are homemade. The tortillas for my tacos were also homemade, delicious, and held up really well to the taco meat. I ordered the al pastor and Adobada. The Adobada wasn't very flavorful--I felt that it needed some type of sauce. The al pastor was delicious! Loved the flavors.  The elotes were, of course, to die for. A must try!",

Beware if you ask for hot salsa on the tacos though as hot is really HOT in Mexico. We are used to very spicy mexican, thai and indian food but we where sweating after eating this salsa and had to flush it down with a couple fo extra beers. Yeah i know its a hard life........ha he.

Pinches delivered although they will yell Gringo Tacos at the top of their lungs when you order them. I find no shame it that, I'll eat those tacos with pride. It was a low carb cheat day and I wanted some hot crispy tortillas to fill the void.  My 5 year old liked their basic quesadilla and my husband stole my chicken taquitos after he polished off the carne asada tacos that I had ordered for him.

Didn't have much time so I called ahead and placed an order for the Al Pastor Burrito. I arrived at Pinches Tacos 30-40 minutes later to find out my order was never made. Very disappointing. My food was ready about 10 minutes later. The burrito was decent sized, and came with a side order of tortilla chips. I think the situation warranted a free beer, but I was too hungry to complain. The burrito was pretty good! Definitely gets the job done while you're visiting the park. Prices are average, and the menu had a big selection. However, if you're looking for the best burritos in town, I highly recommend Cardenas.",

The place was just so small , only 2 tables at the corner and almost no space between each other  , literally each others back    2. We order a quesadilla ! Blend ! I know it's a quesadilla but there's places that you can always taste a good quesadilla , this was not the place.  We also had carne asada fries , the fries were kinda good maybe 3 starts out of 5 for the fries -you can totally taste \"fake  \" the one that comes in a bag  My mother in law order tacos de papa (flautas with potato and cheese)  again , blend ! Then order a side of chips and salsa ( not for free) almost $6 dollars for old chips and salsa that ain't even salsa - more like pico de gallo( onion, cilantro, tomatoe in lemon  and juice ) and last but not least street Mexican  on the cob (mayo,butter, and chile en polvo( chile powder) this was the best thing I had from all the food we had . All that almost $50.00     Glad didn't try the tacos because the person I from of us seem like they didn't like their tacos either , as far as I am concerned I don't think I will come back here at pinches tacos - I think food truck food tastes way  better than this place",

Cons: 1) bad smell inside like the grey water was backing up or they had standing water with grease mixed in somewhere. 2) prices are too expensive ($40 for 6 tacos, 2 waters, 1 beer is too much - even though \"this is Vegas\"). 3) Food was just \"ok\". Even though the tortillas were made fresh, they lacked flavor. The meat quality was average. 4) The food took about 15 minutes even though we were the only customers. This seems a little long for a place that may have very high traffic at times. Overall, not the best option in the area for mexican food and probably won't return to this site. Employees were nice and were just doing their job, so this review is no reflection on them!",

I also had a michelada for no other reason than very few restaurants offer it. It was nice and refreshing on a hot night.  I can't recommend the chorizo dip enough. It's rich, creamy and the ultimate comfort food.  Delicious food is served here.",

My sister would sum up the review with a simple, \"Yummy.\" However, we're not talking men we're discussing food. I am not a good food critic, but these tacos were finger licking good. I also had the blood orange margarita; at first I thought the guy at the counter stiffened me, nah, I can't get off my chair tasty these are. Shsssss don't tell my therapist. F me crazy, I am so glad I came back and gave these guys another try.   Honest, it's not the tequila talking come and give them a try. Down town is not just a great song it's a great place to spend a few hours. Las Vegas rules!",

We were hungry, we came thirsty for some dos X cocktails, and we did not get let down.   We brought a big crew with us and gave warning a few days before. When we arrived, on the roof of Pinches, they'd put a table together to seat all 13 of us.   I stood at the front of the line and got each member of the group to tell the cashier their order; she was patient, friendly and a lot of fun. Same with the chefs; whilst I waited for people to decide what food they wanted to order (we all got the three combination taco plate, some couldn't decide what mix of tacos they wanted), I joked around with them in Spanish - they were good sports and were really focused in delivering for us.  End result? 13 happy out of towners who got served in the best way possible. Food comas all round. I highly recommend the Chilaquiles!!!",

When I walked in, I was not greeted. I continued to the menu and looked to see pricing. I then walked to the register and stood for five minutes while employees ate food by the grill and did not once ask if they could help, if i needed something, or to take my order. So, shortly after I walked out. I was the only customer in the store. Apparently the food is good here, though. One star for bad customer service skills.",

This was our first stop at Container Park, and as soon as my uncle parked the SUV he was running off to Pinches.    Quote from my uncle: \"I LOOOOOOOVE the corn, it's sooo GOOD! You have to try it. It's my favorite at the Container!\" This is all he talks about when talking about Container Park. He loves your corn!   I've had the elote corn in a cup from the Vegas outdoor swap meet and I definitely agree, Pinches' elote is sooo good!   They have an extensive menu and I've been following them on Instagram, and I have to say I wish I saved my appetite for this place! We had lunch right before this, and I was too full to eat anything. I managed to eat the whole cob of corn and a drink a cup of beer. Oh! and I got to sip their horchata with cinnamon, it was so good! Better than what I've had at other Mexican restaurants.   Service was 5 star excellente. The women helping us each time we went back for beer were amazing.   I'll definitely be back for the horchata and to try the rest of their menu!",

We finally went in and tried a burrito and a couple of taco's with rice & beans.  We've eaten at plenty of VERY good Mexican places in our lives and in comparison this place is on our bottom list. The reasons are the burrito was half filled with rice and over priced. We ordered a carne asada burrito, not a rice burrito with a little bit of meat. The refried beans were very good but the rice was barely okay. So we've decided this place is on our \"pass\" list of places to eat in Vegas. We're still on a search to finding a GOOD Mexican place in Vegas. PS...Customer service was good.",

    "text": "First of all, when we were ordering our food there was a lot of unclarity and confusion. My friend ordered the gringo tacos with shredded chicken which she always gets at the other locations, but she said they couldn't do that. Fine. Then I asked her what the vegan options were and she said I could do a vegetable burrito which states that it comes with vegetables. She asked me if I wanted rice and beans but I guess she apparently thought I meant I just wanted rice and beans.... because when I got my burrito after half an hour it was just rice and beans.. I asked her about the vegetables and she looked dumbfounded and didn't explain anything lol. We were also waiting for a long time and saw other tables, who ordered after us getting their food first. We had 4 orders at the table and they all got brought at different times. We understand that they were busy but it shouldn't be an excuse to lag on customer service. The worst part is that the food wasn't even worth the wait. My bean and rice burrito felt like a 5 year old put it together: soggy and shapeless and cold.  My friend did however like her tacos and said they were warm. The salsa was weird though! I am quite confused by how busy this joint was.",

The atmosphere reminded me of a taqueria in TJ but if you're looking for legit tacos, I recommend going to Tacos Y Gordos or Tacos Y Tacos.  Bottom line, for the price, Theres better alternatives. The horchata though was pretty good and refreshing.",

I got Carnitas, Al Pastor, and Fish Tacos.  Of the 3, I'd probably only get the al pastor ones again. The other two were good, but I can do without them next time.  They've got a bunch of other stuff on their menu so check them out but this is a sweet deal! And around this time, it's nice to sit out there in the day with the sun shining on you.

They all have \"edgy\" names, which if you know some Spanish slang, might make you a little uncomfortable ordering in front of your kids.  Prices are decent, rice, beans and chips are really good.  Like every other place in the container park, there's basically zero seating inside. Great to sit on the patio if the weather is good, not so great in December/January.  I'm boosting to 4 stars because I like the container park (gentrification complete!).",

The steak was seasoned and grilled to perfection. I found myself talking about them the next day and every time I think of Container Park.  I also LOVE the \"Mexican Corn\". The corn was HUGE and served with cream, cheese, lime and chili. I've only had corn like this served out of a shopping cart on the streets of Las Vegas and Los Angeles. I remember hoping the corn guy would come around so I could have some. This was ten times better than the shopping cart corn (and that was pretty good too). In fact people walking by kept asking where I got the corn.  My boyfriend had the lengua torta and loved it. He gets lengua all of the time for tacos and said this was really good.

When we came here I got steak tacos, and I can honestly say that they are the best tacos I have ever eaten. Even though I live 35 minutes away from Container Park,, I do not mind making the trip when i'm craving some authentic Mexican food. When you walk in you can feel very overwhelmed by the line of people and the chalkboard menu, fear not my friends, they have a smaller printed menu that is easier to navigate.  The only thing that I can complain about here is that Container Park closes to the 21 and under crowed at 9:00pm, which is a total bummer, its not Pinches fault, but it sucks when you're craving some steak tacos and you cant get them. Keep it up Pinches!",

They came with crema gucamole and pico I only got one bite but the filling was delicious. We spent almost $25 for two menu items, one fountain drink and a bottle of water, a little pricey but definitely worth it.

They have a huge menu and the majority of my family got burritos, either al pastor or pollo and my sister got the vegetarian tacos. The burritos are BOMB! I will be going back to container park just for the burrito. I've eaten a ton of burritos over the years as they are my favorite but this is by far the best burrito I have ever had! Definitely worth it....you won't regret it!",

Has a bite of one of his carne asada tacos and wanted more. So we ordered a carne asada burrito. Great combination of ingredients, and the tortillas taste amazing.  Only disappointment was when I ordered potato and cheese taquitos, they poured salsa all over the top, when I asked for guacamole instead. So they were nice enough to remake them (I also tipped them extra for remaking them), but then all I got was potato taquitos with no cheese, no sour cream, OR guacamole. So I had two potato taquitos with a container of salsa. Really annoying that they got it even more wrong the second time. I was really nice about the mistake too, and thought I'd made myself pretty clear in what I wanted.",

This restaurant makes americanized Mexican food for tourists, that do not know the difference.  First lets start with the quality of he meats they use, poor grade! Then lets discuss their red chili sauce tastes like it comes straight from a can. The fish tacos, are below average, they lack spice and flavor, The white sauce was bland, and they don't put salsa on their fish tacos, if they did add Pico De Gallo, it was bland.  Overall, bland tacos.  The chicken enchiladas are more cheese enchiladas, it had so much cheese, I had to remove the excessive amounts, just to make it palatable.  What you are getting here is bland, americanized food, called Mexican food.  An irrefutable truth, the food is BLAND.  False ratings by people that don't know what Mexican food should taste like!!!!  FYI, there is no BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN VEGAS, and for those of you that are easily impressed with the name, PINCHES tacos, wake up and smell the kibble!  The only thing that was Pinche about this restaurant, was me for going in this place.",

    "text": "Came here one night looking for a late night dinner, and was glad to find that they stay open late. At night, the Container Park transforms into an adult playground: 21+ only, and the bars and restaurants stay open. Adults play in the playground -- the tree house, the slide, some games, and the praying mantis comes alive. We came on a Monday, so it was quiet. They don't actually have many tables inside, and it's not really that comfortable sitting inside, but I do like their outdoor seating! It seemed like they were cleaning even though they were still open for another hour, so that was odd...However, they were very accommodating in taking our order and friendly, despite the fact that the person taking our order had to maneuver around someone else mopping.  Food is solid, but not mind-blowingly good. Fun spot to grab a bit, especially at night when the mantis is alive. We got an order of chips and salsa to start and elote (Mexican street corn). I also got a fish and an al pastor taco. OH, and we also got their blood orange margarita. And that's when things started to get fuzzy...The blood orange margarita is super tasty, but also super strong!?  My friend LOVED their salsa and actually went back to ask for more. And came back with a big bowl. I preferred their al pastor taco to the fish. From what I remember, the al pastor was decent, but not really rave-worthy. Something about the fish taco slaw was off...maybe they put too much cabbage or didn't chop up the cabbage finely enough, or was missing crema? The elote was great! I love elote, so I'm not sure how you'd mess it up in my book. I love that they have it here! And it's served on a stick, so you can eat it right off the cob without getting your hands too messy.",

My True test at any 'traditional' Mexican food restaurant is the carne asada tacos. That's what I ordered, and was very much unimpressed. The beef did not smell fresh. Evidently my nose and taste buds were right as my stomach bothered me all day after. It was very gamy tasting, enough to where their verde salsa couldn't cover it up.  I'll save my next trip for Tacos El Gordo. Fresh, inexpensive, and authentic.",

Last night we took my in-laws to the container park because I had heard from friends about how cool all the restaurants and bars are.  We were surprised to find out there are only a handful to choose from, so we picked Pinches, and I of course bit the bullet and decided to give it a try.  Mom ordered the enchiladas with beans and rice. The tortilla was on-point and the chicken was moist and flavorful, but the red sauce is too sweet.  Dad ordered a burrito with lengua. It came with guac, cilantro, salsa, onions, beans, and rice inside.  Everyone really liked it. He also ordered a chicken taco, which was also delicious.  Sean ordered a carnitas torta with onions, guac, Mexican creme, cilantro, and beans inside. It was good- the bread was almost like a flat bread.  I ordered the asada \"not nachos\", which had cheese, guac, beans, green salsa (everyone else's orders came with red), home-made chips, and sour cream (I asked for no onions, so there weren't any).  It was f***ing delicious! I'm craving it even now as I write this review at 9 am and I'm not even hung over!!! The steak was honestly the shining star; it was so flavorful and not overly chewy or hard. Also it was kinda refreshing- everything was fresh and went well together like a flavor explosion in your mouth.  My nachos were definitely the table favorite.  I think we'll be back soon!!!",

The sandwich itself is pretty stuffed consisting of a fried fillet, their coleslaw, and beans. Each bite has a harmonious combination of hot and cool as well as tender and a slight crunch full of flavor. I personally know the owner and he and his staff are very flexible when it comes to customizing or substituting orders. They make you feel like family not because of the cool dia de los muertos and loteria decor everywhere, but because of their warm and friendly interactions.   Rating wise I would give this place a 5 star rating, but the only reason why I'm not is for their spacing in this particular location. It's extremely compact and limited. Everything else is outside and since it's Vegas, you're either being blasted with scorching heatwaves or cold air.",

We always look  for yelp reviews looking for the best and we go no matter price or distance, (we live on SW).  They are located inside container park, and that's maybe why when u enter there's space just for 2 tables inside, and about 5 tables out and a few more on a second level.   When we enter nobody greet, just silence, we didn't even know if we were supposed to sit or make the order on the cashier first, there's no sign. We order about 14 tacos for 3 adults and 1 kid, 2 cokes , 2 corn on the cob and chips with salsa for about 65 dollars...   Taste was bad, and my son who was hungry didn't even finish them cause the taste..!, neither the little one,  I decide to take the rest of the tacos on a to go container, on the way home the car start to smell so bad because of the meat I had to stop and put them on the trash. Gross..  Overall super overpriced, bad service and bad food.",

I have never heard of such a wait time for tacos! As someone who's visited many taco places in Illinois/Chicago area and Atlanta, I know for a fact that the best taco places have quick service (its basically like...street food in Mexico y'know) and great quality food! after 1.5 hours of waiting, the pollo tacos we got were cold, and I HATE cold beans (they only gave us about half a scoop). Asking for water took another 15 minutes because the line was so long and the poor cashier was being bombarded.   Almost took the food back to have it reheated but didn't want to wait any longer T_T. Arrived at 8:00pm for what we thought was going to be a quick dinner before the main event (El Cortez and Fremont Street Experience), but it was almost 10PM before we even left the plaza...wait time was longer than Gordon Ramsey Restaurants on the strip, and their portion sizes were so tiny that I wasn't even full off of a full taco dinner ($10+). Darn it, Reddit. Disappoint.",

They bring your order out to you if you're sitting outside which you most likely will as the seating inside is limited.  They do get the food out in a timely manner which I appreciate.  Food: The 3 taco plates comes to you served on a 3 section styrofoam plate along with rice, beans and some tortilla chips.  The tacos were made with fresh ingredients but unfortunately tasted very bland and lacked flavor.  The beans and rice quality was something you can purchase at your local grocery store.  I think they can do better.  The blood orange margarita was decent and and served in a plastic cup out of a soft drink machine dispenser.  I thought they got my drink order wrong and I was served an orange soda, but all was well.  Value: The 3 Taco plate was about $10 and the Blood Orange Margarita was $8.  I understand there's a premium for the location but the quality of food is lacking even for the premium location.    I like sitting outside in Container Park on a nice days with the crew and would love nothing more than to enjoy that time with good Mexican food.  I'm going to give them another chance because the staff is great and I'll hit up the nachos or burritos next time.  Update coming sooner versus later as I love Container Park and the Downtown area.",

    "text": "I came in to Pinches Tacos mainly for a taste of the Mexican style streen corn. But I didn't feel right ordering just corn so I got a taco al pastor too.   Long story short, the prices are high and service takes too long.  Short story long, yes, the food here is kind of pricey. $3+ for a small taco. Almost $3 for an ear of corn. And yes, it took a long time to get just a taco and ear of corn. The staff seem to prepare multiple orders before carrying them out to the customers who, in most cases, eat outside. It was getting gusty outside while I waited so I moved inside.  My food came out very shortly after I moved myself inside the restaurant. The al pastor taco came with a goodly amount of pork, a fair bit of onion and cilantro and a healthy laddle of salsa. It was dripping grease and juice. It was a good representation of one of my favorite types of tacos but it was not my favorite version. The house made tortilla was a nice touch though.   The corn was good as Mexican style street corn tends to be. The crisp kernels of sweet corn took nicely to the crema, cheese and chili. I enjoyed it thoroughly though, again, it was not my favorite version of the dish.   For me, the food is fresh and service is friendly. I appreciate both. But the price you pay and the time you wait is disproportionate to what you receive. Another case of a place to check out if you are in the area but not to make a destination of.",

If you're in the mood for a great marg and an even greater taco, this is the place to go. I recommend the al pastor and the blood orange margarita, but honestly, if you're on the hunt for the jammy jam, anything here with any drink, go for it. If you don't like this place, you probably think Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food and we can't be friends. Anyways, all said and done: go for it. You won't regret it.",

After waiting 20 minutes (with 20+ more to go), I went in, cancelled my order and asked for a refund. The cashier then tried to lie and steal his tip back after I paid in cash and left the change as a tip in good faith.   Long version:  The total was $6 and some change. I have never had an issue here, so I paid $8 in cash and told the cashier to keep the change as a tip in good faith. Little did I know, the guy failed to disclose that it was a 45+ minute wait. A group of 3 guys that were already waiting before us went in to ask how long it would be for theirs, my son and I had been waiting for 20 minutes ourselves, and the guys reported that it would be another 15 at least for theirs.   What the heck!!! I went in and spoke to the cashier, who immediately copped an attitude and refused to acknowledge that he should have communicated to customers about the excessive wait times. I canceled my order and asked for a refund.  He complied and gave me the money for the tacos but THEN he tried to lie and tell me he gave me the change back so he could keep the tip!!! THAT is what really set me off and prompted me to write this review.   I refuse to support a business that has straight up dishonest and sketchy employees.",

I usually opt for the carne asada fries or Nachos which are loaded with everything but the kitchen sink. The prices are a lil steep but .. well in the area it doesn't break the bank. Service can range from fast paced to slow as a snail. Also when it's crowded also determines the time factor. Upon my last visit it was past 8PM so the waiting time was pretty short.",

On to the Pinches Tacos, well I am from Ohio where tacos are on the high end $2.5 to $3 at most. Pinches tacos has a special platter of 3 tacos rice and beans. If you are money conscious I recommend you get that. The place is eco friendly and definitely worth the visit. It is yummy and the rice is to die for! The rice omg! Perfect Mexican rice! Go there, get the platter, enjoy the experience! We didn't come back mostly because of the price range. We found other food joints around the strip that gave us more for our buck, we are foodies like that lol.",

Take them for the obligatory walk down Freemont St, then stroll over to Pinches for your reward! Delicious, amazing tacos!  I always get the taco plate. 3 tacos of your choice, rice and beans. And although I am definitely a gringo, but one my favorite is the lengua tacos (if you don't know, maybe you should not ask.) But the fish tacos are amazing, as are the rest. I have never been disappointed here!  Last time I was there, had a bite of the Torta (a mexican sandwich) - It was awesome too!   If you are a local or even visitor and in the Old Downtown/Freemont area. Do yourself a favor and go check out Pinches in the Container Park. You will not be disappointed! YUM!",

Their slogan is \"Real Mexican Food made by Real Mexicans\" after all. We came post-dinner rush & right before a crowd of tourist hipsters & ordered the pinches asada fries (best name ever) to share & it was perfection. Perfect size for two, not too greasy, and just the right amount of sour cream, cheese & guac. The fries were crispy and the asada, while it wasn't the best asada ever (which in my biased opinion is always in San Diego), is pretty good. We finished the whole thing in 10 minutes while watching the praying mantis breathe actual fire, & the Container Park atmosphere definitely adds to the modern Vegas (in downtown Vegas) vibe. Pinches, we'll be back for ya.",

I couldn't tell the difference between the shrimp and the fish there was so much breading on them. They also charge you .50 cents each taco for \"upgrading\" to seafood. Elote was pretty good, not the best I've had,  little heavy on the mayo. Horchata was good.  For $35 for two people to have street tacos and a fountain drinks, it was a tad overpriced, in my opinion.

    "text": "When I show up to a typical Mexican food joint, if I see carnitas in the menu, you've already got my attention.   But Pinches' has an unfair advantage: they serve beer. Another unfair advantage is that Pinches is located inside Container Park(an awesome atmosphere with live music usually playing 90% of the time), but one of the big reasons I give this place a five stars, is their serving system seems to be nearly perfect. This is my third visit, the first time being given a wrong order, but a mere SECONDS later, the correct food was on our table(nothing worse than being hungry and seeing someone else's food) and we were chowing down.  I like my burrito made a certain way and they served it up exactly how I like it with no guff. Great food. Great atmosphere. Beer. How can you go wrong?   With Taco y Taco and Roberto's in town, it's nice to try excellent burritos and fish tacos with great flavor. This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Las Vegas",

Food was decent, but a few days later when the charge hit my credit card I found that they gave themselves a $25 tip on a $27 check. OK, I understand they were busy and someone probably just mis-entered it... no big deal. However, after trying unsuccessfully for 2 months to get it corrected I'm done with this place.  Tried repeatedly to get in touch with the local manager. Finally did after about 6 tries. He took my info and said he would correct it, but never did. After that, any time I've called (no matter what time of day) the manager isn't there. Tried to contact their offices in CA directly and via social media, but no response there either. Just poor customer service all around.  Adios, Pinches.",

I had never been to the container park so I had to look at the menu from outside the shop to make sure it was the right place.   My phone was dead almost a second after I walked in, so I had to stay in place while I waited for Maria to show up. There are only a few tables, but that's okay. At first I was a bit startled because of the flame shooting praying mantis outside literally shakes the building!   I ordered a lengua taco and a sope de pollo. Instead I got charged for two sopes and no lengua taco. They gave me two sopes and I asked when my taco was coming. When I realized the discrepancy, I told them that it was okay, but they still gave me the taco on the house, which was nice.   Maria got a burrito and I believe she really liked it. I also gave her my second sope and she loved it.   I want to go back to try a few more items before I up the stars because I currently feel that Tacos El Gordo has them beat. The service is great but the food is just okay to me.",

Creamy, flavorful, piping hot and just delicious. Their taco combos come with 3 full size tacos on homemade corn tortillas and meats grilled to order. We topped it off with the blood orange margaritas and be warned...they are strong, but totally refreshing after a long morning in the Vegas sun. You for sure get your moneys worth.  In my party of 6 we got just about every taco on the menu. Their menu will accommodate any dietary restriction you have - gluten free, dairy free, vegetarian etc. You will not regret a giant plate of freshly grilled meats, tortillas, and a whole lotta love.",

Apparently my only option was to order the \"small\" queso. In the moment, I just went with it and agreed. But ended up paying almost twice the price and had way more chips (the queso came with its own chips) than I ever needed or even wanted.

Free refills on the soda   The only downfall was the wait. For our family of four, it took almost 25 minutes to get our food.   I had the chicken tacos. My son had a burrito and my husband had steak tacos. We were all very pleased and full.",

Ordered two carne asada ($3.95 each) with everything on it (that should include salsa, onions and cilantro) while my boyfriend ordered two al pastor tacos ($3.30 each), also requested everything to be on it.  When the tacos were delivered, it was plain....just meat. So I kindly asked the lady who brought the tacos to us if we can have some onions & cilantro. There must have been a language barrier because we waited for about 5-7 minutes and I never saw her come back. So I went in and asked for onions and cilantro. The two ladies spoke to each other and one only came back with onions. Alright...better than nothing I guess.  But I definitely would NOT come out of my way for Pinches Tacos. You're better off with Tacos El Gordo or there's a taco truck close by. These tacos are flavorless AND at almost $4.00 each....thank you, next!",

It wasn't overwhelming with cinnamon nor sugar like many horchata drinks that I have tasted before.  Rather, the mixture was just right! Unfortunately, the drinks only came in one size, which if I had the option I'd get a bigger cup. It was that good!   The beans and rice were delicious, along with the fresh chips. They were what my younger cousins said, \"bomb\"! Haha   The area is really small and can become over-crowded, however the area that they are located compensated for that.  They are located at Container Park, therefore they have a lot of open tables outside. What's best is that there is a park area for the kids that they can enjoy if you are not finished with your meal.   Overall, I enjoyed my meal. I had the three taco combo, this included three tacos, rice, and beans. The carne was tender, not chewy nor stiff. The taco itself was great it was burnt on the edges and it wasn't soft either. It had just enough crunch and softness to it.",

We, group of 3, ordered 3 chicken tacos, asada fries, Chilaquiles, and two aquafresca drinks. I had the tacos, and I'd like to say, I would put them up in at least the top 4 in flavor of chicken tacos I think I've ever had. They were moist, topped perfectly with cilantro, onion, and red sauce. But they were flavored SO well. I don't know if the chicken was marinated or what went on there but JEEZ they were AWESOME! And they're served in a homemade tortilla shell, which was cooked perfectly. The asada fries were awesome too, and my wife was really impressed with the guac that was served with it. Our friend from California ordered the Chilaquiles and said they were done perfectly. It wasn't busy when we went, so we sat outside and people watched. The Fresca drinks were delicious, too. All in all, the food was way above average, and I will definitely return and would definitely recommend to others.",

Went there today and ordered 2 margaritas to enjoy while waiting for friends to order food. We noticed that the rims wasn't salted and immediately walked back to have it salted. The server refused us and said I didn't ask for salt.... seriously??? Then we asked if he was serious, we thought he was joking. He refused again and said he was too busy. There was only 2 guys waiting for their food. We handed back the margaritas and got the money back on my card.... he kept the tip.  It would have taken less then a minute to pour our watered down margaritas into a salted rim plastic cup. Wowwww",

    "text": "Man I really wanted to like this place but it was a total miss. Firstly I'm from California so yes I'm spoiled by AMAZING Mexican food just about anywhere.   I'll start with the positives:  I ordered a 3 taco combo plate with, 2 carne asada tacos and 1 grilled chicken. Rice and beans.   The tortillas were the highlight of the meal honestly. The meat quality was also appreciated.   Now onto the misses...  1.) the salsa had no flavor all I could taste were onions and lime no roasted tomatillo flavor or spice.   2.) the carne asada was incredibly salty I only ate 1 taco.   3.) the chicken taco was topped with red \"salsa\" which was basically just crush tomatoes. Again no flavor or spice. The chicken itself was mildly seasoned but bland none the less.   4.) the beans and rice came out cold and both flavorless.    Overall I wouldn't come back. My boyfriend ordered nachos and even he said they weren't good...kinna hard to screw up nachos. Indoor seating is sparse so be ready to sit outside.",

It's a blue or train car on the left as you walk in. We walked container park in 3 laps before we almost gave up. I don't know why it was hard to fine but we indeed struggled just using gps. The menu is pretty basic, gives you food truck vibes. The pastor taco was good though, just not run tell that amazing. We came here mainly for some super strong margaritas we heard about and it didn't disappoint. My coworkers claimed they could barely finish one and I knew these lightweights were exaggerated. Being an experienced margarita expert, you can definitely finish one...but the one is like a double. Sooooooo I could barely finish 2 and for $8 that's pretty darn good. Definitely enough to make this my first margarita stop on Fremont.",

And I am shamed I still do not have the recipe down 100% LOL. It's located in container Park so it goes without saying the location is very tiny. But if there's a line it is worth the wait.

The staff here were total \"pinches\" my 3 year old autistic son got the look when he spilled his Jamaica. And when I asked the waitress for a refill--she told me to go inside and pay. Listen, I've spilled drinks at fast food places and they've offered to refill. Accidents happen right!? Their sign mentioned \"owned by real Mexicans\" but when my real Mexican mother asked a woman a question in Spanish( yes this is America I get it) she acted like she didn't understand and responded in broken English. Aside from below average customer experience the food was cold and not acceptable for consumption. Since when are quesadillas served cold? All the plates were cold and the presentation could have been better assembled by the 1 year old in our party. The container park is catered to families and this establishment better think twice of they want to increase revenue. Turning the stick eye on helpless children is less than favorable for their reputation. If you have kids or like good Mexican food this pinche restaurant is not for you! Save your time and money.",

My husband and I visited Pinche's tacos to see what the hype was all about. We weren't expecting authentic Mexican cuisine,  just good taco shop food.  We waited in line to order for 20mins, waited for our food to be brought to us for another 20 mins! I had the tortilla soup and corn, both were good enough to order again next time.  The mole burrito was missing mole flavor, but I do give credit that they are large burritos that they are selling. All of the food had a very Indian food like taste to it. Rather weird IMO. We did go on a Saturday night,  but that shouldn't be the issue,  I think they need more staff,  1 to possibly wipe down the tables inside, our table was filthy.  Because there are only a few dining options in Downtown LV, I would go again if friends wanted to check out it. But I think I rather eat at Cardenas Market for more of an authentic flavor.",

My friends had burritos, enchiladas, and a torta sandwich, all were a great size for the cost. They have Dos Equis on draft, as well as margaritas.  Yes the place is small....it's in the \"container park\".  The concept is to have smaller spaces with cheaper rent to promote local business. For sure it's not GAP, Claire's, or Taco Bell. I love the atmosphere, feels like you're not really in Vegas. My only worry are the metal seats outdoors when it's 100+ degrees out. Other than that, I'll definitely be back to hang out here.",

I understand that it was crazy, but we were given our drinks and then had to stand there waiting for the bill on more than one occasion. They need to add another register at the bar if they can't keep up with customer demand at that point. There was one particular man who helped me out more than once and I wish I had gotten his name, but he was in a white Pinches t-shirt and a blue hat. He was very sincere with his checking in on customers and he helped me out very promptly. I live in far North Las Vegas, but I'm thinking of driving over to Pinches for more of those tacos.",

They came with queso fresco too, which I love and is such a deal maker kind of topping for me. I also got their Watermelon Juice which was just a lovely as the nachos.  The second time I came to Pinches Tacos, I got their Elote, which tastes just as good as the elote you get from the neighborhood carts! I tried the Blood Orange Margarita, but ended up just trading it for a Watermelon Juice because the margarita was much too strong for me at that time.  Anyway, go to Pinches Tacos! They have real Mexican food that you will love!",

The best deal is their combination plate of 3 tacos that comes with rice and beans so you'll definitely be full! Coupled with watermelon juice and it will quench your thirst on a hot summer day in Vegas! Just hitting this place up is worth your trip to Container Park (in which the restaurant is made up of a freight container). The staff is very friendly and had us say enchilada before taking our picture... funny guy!  Cons: Nothing off the top of my head. The price, quality, quantity, service, and atmosphere was good!  Overall: For some authentic Mexican food goodness, you got to eat here!",

Not only they serve tacos, they offer others choice like burritos, sopes, tortas, enchiladas, taquitos and breakfast during the weekend before 2 p.m.   Wasn't too hungry so I ordered two tacos: 1 Adobada (California chili marinated pork) & 1 asada (grilled grass-fed beef). The tacos were tasty, the asada tacos was one of the best asada tacos I had in a long time and the pork were in chunks which I really enjoy. The prices are higher than the average taco spot but they  use high quality meat and fresh vegetables. Next time I will definitely try something than tacos because everything on the menu sounds delicious.",

    "text": "Coming for my first time to Downtown Container Park, my sister was taking me out for a fun day together, shopping and eating. We walked into Pinches Tacos, and I noticed how many people were out on the patios happily eating and watching their kids play on the playground. As far as I could see, Pinches Tacos was the food of choice amongst the people eating, so we decided to start here.   ATMOSPHERE Walking in, the decor is interesting: pink walls with dancing skeletons. It wasn't creepy, but it was more of a culture-happy vibe. It made me a bit excited to try what was on their menu.   SERVICE The lady behind the counter was helpful, very knowledgable about the menu and very laidback, in a good way. She let my sister and I try the blood orange margarita, and while we were doing so, the owner Javier came in a greeted his workers in a friendly manner. Then he jumped into our conversation out of the blue, which actually took us by surprise, but he was actually pretty fun! We took shots ON THE HOUSE from (and with) Javier. Definitely a great experience xD  FOOD:  SHRIMP TACO WITH COLESLAW, the shrimp is plump and juicy, with good seasoning. The coleslaw however is okay. Nothing to write home about, but I would order this again for the shrimp. At $3.15 it is a bit pricey, but service made it taste better.  MEXICAN CORN ON THE COB, with everything, it was delicious. Lots of cheese,  crema and seasonings. With hot sauce, it was just the way I had it on a beach in Cali. Yes, again this was probably a little pricey to, but it refreshing and with the free shot, it was worth the few bucks!   BLOOD ORANGE MARGARITA, fruity, just the right amount of ice and the margarita mix is strong but delicious  Overall, I had a fun and welcoming experience. It was my favorite part of my first experience of Downtown Container Park!",

It's sort of an eclectic type of mall that has great eateries, notably Pinches Tacos. I ordered the combo taco plate, with chicken and shrimp... and corn. You rarely find street tacos with good meat. I've found a place. And, the corn was so good. Im writing a review of my second experience...

Tacos were like $2.50+ each but total Cost was 33+. Should have ate at Perch or the BBQ place. The tacos were okay, nothing to shout about even if it was made by real Mexicans, as their signs proudly  proclaimed \"Mexican food by real Mexicans\". Cashier did not offer a receipt n I didn't want to hold up people behind us.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this please out, reading reviews on Yelp about how good it is and so on. So my husband and I decided to go try this place out. I love that it's in the Container Park vicinity, kids can play, music, shopping, etc... Anyway, my husband and I ordered the Al Pastor burrito with everything, my daughter wanted carne asada fries, my other kid wanted taquitos (2 in a plate no rice or beans), we also ordered a side of rice, 3 fountain drinks and 2 Blood Orange Margaritas.... Grand total $76.00 and change!! I was like whaaaaat?! But we're like whatever it must be that good and probably lots of food! Because being Mexican our portions are big! They gave us our number and were seated. They brought our food pretty quick, a plus. But to our surprise the burritos were super small and I'm saying this because other regular taco stands or restaurants the burritos are pretty big, the taquitos for my daughter were itty bitty! And the asada fries were blah! As we started eating I ask my husband if he had any meat in his burrito and was like \"NO\", so we just pretty much had a rice, bean and guacamole burrito with like a sliver of meat! Ugh!! So freaking disappointing!!! The blood orange margaritas weren't all that either! Tasted like the ready made margarita bottle you get from Costco ... We were soooo disappointed in this place. I'm sorry but it didn't feel like \"Real Mexican food by Real Mexicans\" I can't say it fell short because it just fell. And for the price, I'll just stick to the taco truck. The decor in the place was nice though",

They gave us a wrong order first off and then the food we were waiting on they never brought it out because it was passed 8:30 and since we had children with us they wanted us to leave since children aren't permitted there after 8:30 without an adult... About 30 minutes passed and I went to ask them about my food and they said they were not going to serve us because of the children!!! They were not even going to attempt in letting us know to get our money back... They were going to keep our money and just let us leave... It was ridiculous and disgusting customer service... They should put a sign... NO KIDS ALLOWED if it's that big of a problem instead of just taking people's money!",

As a vegetarian, there wasn't much for me at any of the meaty buffets Vegas is known for. So to my delight I found some fantastic Mexican food for really cheap here! The tortillas are all homemade, and all the vegetarian options were DELICIOUS (Which is not always easy to find). The must have item would definitely be the Mexican corn. Also would recommend the chilequiles and huevos rancheros.",

    "text": "My pinche  review... When I saw this place (container park) I just had to stop and check it out. It kinda looked like a kids Quest for adults. I walked around checking all those unique stores and places to eat and decided to go into the pinches tacos container and order some food. Not my first time in a container but it is the first ordering tacos inside one. Last time I was in one of those containers there was definitely no tacos or beer for that matter and my \"first\" class travel companions weren't as nice as the people inside this one, but that's another story and what happened in that container stayed in that container, this is Vegas and this review is about pinches tacos....... The menu. I didn't get to read it all, actually I wasn't really going to try it is a huge blackboard with like a thousand items written all over it. the combo plate for 8.95 any three tacos caught my eyes and I ordered the asada tacos but came up to 10.45 because they charge .50 extra per taco for the asada or seafood. ( asada tacos are made with grilled angus beef.) Most of the seating is outside but they did manage to include some seating inside and if you're lucky you may find an empty table inside and enjoy your tacos in full container experience, specially if it's freezing outside.  Tacos were good...very good. I need to go back and try other items, I took a to go menu and been planning my next visit. Tacos de pollo mole and camaron Fritos sounds very appetizing as many other items on the extensive menu. Service was good, you place your order, you're given a number (a Mexican lottery card in this case) and your food is delivered to your table by a smiling employee that makes sure your experience at pinches tacos is an excellent one.  If you like good tasting tacos made with quality fresh ingredients and a clean environment, pinches tacos is the place to go. If cheap quantity and greasy food is your thing,.... well Roberto, this is not for you, but you'll be Gordo in no time.  #greatfood! #greatservice #gordo=fat",

    "text": "Firstly, let me say that I support the business name and theme.  It's got a great vibe to it for a small shop and it isn't afraid to have a little bit of personality.    It's tucked into Container Park near Downtown East Fremont, and I do mean tucked - it's almost hidden in a back corner.  I didn't see a title outside, which is probably thanks to its personality-filled name.  I can dig it.  The service was spot on, friendly and fast.  Everyone on staff delivered full smiles and plenty of help to this gringo as needed.  I ordered the taco combo - three tacos of any choice and rice and beans.  Asada.  Al pastor.  And lenga.  Both the carne asada and the pastor were great, simple with a nice flavor and satisfying.  The lenga was a bit of a disappointment, but it was late in the evening and they did say they were running low.  So I'll cut it a bit of a break.  Overall though, for a quick taco spot in downtown, I think it accomplishes what its after.  And hey, it's all in the name.",

However, I don't recommend walking all the way to Container Park 5 min before they close at 11pm. We had to sit in the park waiting for our takeout, with all the security guards hovering around us waiting for us to leave. Our food was finally ready at quarter after 11, and security quickly ushered us out onto the empty street. Walking back a few blocks to the more populated area of Fremont street was a bit creepy. Where was everyone? Weird. Next question was, where are we going to eat our takeout? We ended up sitting at a bunch of slot machines in the divey Fremont Street Casino while scarfing down our Pinches Tacos. Not the classiest atmosphere, but so worth it. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

The pico de gallo salsa I got with my meal tasted old & sour, only took 1 bite. My $10 carne asada burrito had mostly beans & rice. The avocado slices in it were brown & stringy. The prices are higher than a regular taco shop - understandable given the location. However, they need to step it up & make it worth it if they want locals to keep going. I was not happy when I saw the way the fridge was organized: marinating meat in bags on a shelf above salsa containers. About 3 tables inside only so it's a small place with mostly outdoor seating. Service was so so. No smiling or happiness. Just there.",

The only thing I wasn't  really a fan of was the tortilla as soon as I picked it up it ripped and the edges were a bit hard. A bit pricy too! Almost $4 for each taco!  Friendly staff can't leave them out the girls were nice! Overall the place/food was good I would come back though.",

I also got the corn on crack from the waiters suggestion as well as the watermelon beverage. The corn on crack was drowning in fake butter,  cheese and chile powder. ... No one at my table would touch it because it smelt and looked gross.  The burritos looked good and folks at my table were satisfied which is why I gave 3 stars. I loved the watermelon beverage! This place has a great name, located in a great park, decent service and ok food.",

    "text": "Craving for Mexican food and ready for a late lunch, my boyfriend and I walked over there from Freemont Street after reading the reviews... And for us it was a hit!  I went for a combo plate with 3 tacos, rice, beans and chips and my BF went for the burrito with lengua. We also took a plate of chips, salsa and guacamole.  The plate with salsa and guacamole was very good, both dips were so fresh, not overwhelmed with spices so you could actually taste the flavor of the avocados and of the salsa. The chips were great too! I got the al pastor, carnitas and pollo mole tacos. Neither of them disappoint. The meats tasted great and well prepared. Personally I actually prefer when the tacos are coming with just one tortilla, you are full less quickly. The sides were both very good too, particularly the beans.  Regarding, the burrito. My boyfriend said the meat was excellent and with a great taste of lengua. It is not over packed with rice. And the cilantro finish to give a fresh taste.   Now the service... The all crew was very friendly. When we entered, we looked at the board to decide what to get and the waitress just told us to take our time and go at the cashier when we were ready, it was nice. For once we didn't feel rushed into making a decision. After getting our food, both the cook and the waitress came to check if everything was ok and seemed very pleased when we told them we greatly appreciated the food.  Finally, regarding the quantity-price. The portion size are good for us (both European). We were both full at the end of our meal and felt that the price were quite good for the quantity and quality of the food you get.",

If you look on the board it can look super overwhelming but they were patient and super friendly especially to my mom who is always hesitant to try different things.  I got the Al Pastor and Elote, mom got the Huevos Ranche tacos.  The quality for everything was great and it is made to order so be patient.  Just a wonderful experience and it was so close to our hotel (10mins walking from Fremont).  Can't wait to come back.",

I picked off the huge bits of cilantro cause I hate it but even with that and the pico on it, it was enough to make me go \"oh my god\" out loud.

Now, typically we would understand if the restaurant employees got cranky because hey, they were cleaning up and getting ready to go home. But to our surprise, we got the COMPLETE opposite of that in terms of service.  We were first timers and had heard so much about this place so we were pleased to find the cashier taking the time to talk to us about some of their popular menu items. We also noticed that there were other diners who were talking to the people in the taco line complimenting everything they just ate which only raised our expectations even more.  In the end, we went with the carne asada and the al pastor tacos. I was able to try both and they were good. The portions of the meat and of the salsa were not bad but the tortilla definitely topped it for me!   I didn't have to worry about it ripping because it had a good hold of everything inside, always a plus in my book!  Overall, the food was not bad. The service and the downtown atmosphere will keep you coming back!",

The guac and chips were really good, the guacamole was fresh and the texture was just right. The friends we were with got taqitos and fish tacos, which they commented were very good, as well.  Service was friendly and accommodating, the place was clean and organized. They find you seated outside and bring you the food.  Bill for us was $25 and change.

The fries were sooo good. The portion size was very generous. For me the fries were a little too crispy but I didn't care too much because everything else on the plate with it was too good!  The corn on the cob was yummy. I've never tried corn with all those toppings but the flavors worked perfectly. I'll be getting it again the next time I come in!  The margaritas were really strong. But I liked it. So no complaints there :). They were fairly filling despite the fact that the cup looks like it isn't holding much!

Jamaica was the only thing that had a good taste and it was a fountain type drink.   The signs entering this place say \"real Mexican food\", these need to come down.

It doesn't sound like the healthiest thing in the world but It is a favorite of mine that isn't sold at a lot of Mexican restaurants. Whenever a place carries this dish I automatically add an extra star...(if it is good.) The Elote is wonderful here!.   I ordered the beef flautas as my main entree . These were also delicious! They were a good size and it was filling.   They have a nice patio for dining but we were lucky enough to find seats inside. The reason I say that is because there isn't a lot of  tables inside so I felt lucky to get one. It's a nice place to grab a bite to eat and people watch.",

    "text": "This was a great start to a night of drunken debauchery in Downtown LV. More info on that... never.  Everything here is pricey, and this is coming from the guy who was upset when Taco y Taco raised their prices at their original location from $2.00 to $2.15. It's $2.60 here at the entry level, unless you decide to try the cactus taco (I didn't). I just went ahead and did the $8.95 combination plate for three tacos (chose al pastor, adobada, and lengua) with rice and beans. I'm not quite sure if the chips were part of the deal or if we actually did get them separately for our entire group.  The food is pretty decent. I really did like the rice and beans, especially the beans. I thought the tacos were each okay, maybe the lengua being the best of the bunch. The al pastor did not come with pineapple, which was disappointing. It was also curious that there was only one tortilla per taco, not two as all the truly good places seem to use. They do offer beer, which is about par for the course downtown.  In a Container Park context, this place is most likely a solid choice. But in the Vegas taco scene, it really isn't worth making the centerpiece of your visit.",

    "text": "Oof. Much like Natalie Imbruglia in '97, I'm torn. This taqueria is a solid 3.5 for me, but considering it was a beautiful day outside and there was a live bass player doing his thing, I'll round up.    Why a 3.5? Price. Size. Taste (1/2 star off).   Picked up the three taco combo ($9 w/ sides of rice, beans and chips), but it's nowhere close to enough food if you eat like a normal human. I'm not asking for Hash House style meals here, but these 'cos are tiny. Mentioning this so you get an extra side or some of that corn, bc you WILL be heading back on line for a few more tacos if you're hungry and only get the special. I suggest going down burrito road if you're looking to fill up. Any who, so yea, I spent $31 on five tacos, 2 beers and an order of chips and guac. Bleh.   Of the 5 tacos eaten, my favorites were the adobada and al pastor. Each were paired with the perfect amount of toppings and the meat was moist and flavorful. A fun 4 bites for each of those tacos. Least fave? The asada. A bit boring for me here.   Looking for the best tacos in Vegas? They're not here. Looking for a good taco downtown? It's here and you might enjoy some live music while you dine.  Side note: a friend mentioned that the pollo mole was the best mole he's ever had.  Sider note: he's from Philly, so he probably hasn't had much mole sauce Sidest note: whomever calls the container park a 'hipster' area is a dolt... it's a total yuppie zone.",

    "text": "To be fair, I like the look of Pinches Tacos, but I only had one thing there to eat - Mexican Corn on the Cob.  Perhaps a more in depth review would give me the chance to add another star.  As one of only a handful of places to eat in the Downtown Container Park, Pinches had a shorter line.  But I wasn't particularly going for entrees here since we had some other food already from another eatery.  I did really want to check Pinches out though.  I ended up getting one of the biggest staples you can find on a Mexican menu besides rice, beans, and tortillas.  Corn on the cob!  The Mexican Corn on the Cob from Pinches Tacos was actually not bad, although I prefer mine grilled.  This one looked like it was just boiled or steamed.  It did have the requisite Mexican cream, cheese, and chili powder on it though.  A very good helping of it.  The corn on the cob was a good size as well, enough for two people to munch off of.  Overall taste was good, the sweet corn blended well with the hit of cream and the salty cheese.  The kick from the chili powder was most welcome.  I would definitely have this again the next time I come back to Pinches Tacos.  The thing that took 1/2 star from this review should be no surprise...the price.  Wow, $3.95 plus tax for one corn on the cob?  Seems really high priced for me.  I mean, you can go down to your local Mexican market around town and get the same corn on the cob (in some cases better) for like $2!  There's this Mexican guy I pass by nearly everyday from work who rolls around his little food cart and sells corn on the cob for $2 and his looks just as good as the one from Pinches Tacos.  I must say, the raise in prices must mean the rent at Downtown Container Park can't be cheap.    Hopefully when I feel like braving the parking and the crowds at this park again I'll be able to stop by Pinches Tacos for another taste.",

The last time I was there, the staff was very rude and argumentative with me about my food order and drink wishes. I ordered my usual meal which comes with salsa and guacamole. They forget the guacamole, which is my favorite part, and I didn't realize until I was already home. My boyfriend also asked for their hottest salsa which they left out as well.   Another issue we ran into is that we ordered a fountain drink and all the sodas in the machine were flat. We mentioned that to the lady who took our order and she said she had to ask the manager what to do, who is also the cook. He came out from behind the counter and took a cup to try the soda. He then proceeded to argue with my boyfriend that the soda wasn't flat until we decided to leave.",

If that's how lunch rush is on a Sunday I would hate to see it on a Saturday but good for them!   Came in and had the following:  Tacos (Asada, Al Pastor) -  tacos were not my pick because I normally get lingua, cabeza, tripas, so not my first choice but I enjoyed it. I appreciated the hand made tortillas. Fluffy and not hard. Just the right amount of salsa that they put on for you. I'm picky since I would rather control the amount myself but still good. The onions weren't over powering.  Michelada -  perfect amount of Tajin and hot sauce. Not too spicy, but not weak either.   Elotes - nothing memorable. Just your corn, mayo, cheese, and spices. But still yummy to eat. Corn was surprisingly sweet.  Torta - this was actually done pretty good. The bread they chose and the size complimented the amount of meat they put in it. Normally you'll get a soggy bread with very little meat and way too much filler but not this one.   All in all, I would come back again. Nothing that makes it stand out for me to go all the way to DTLV from Henderson but if I was in the area I'll definitely give them a try. I'm just very partial to Taco y Taco that's all",

There was so much to choose from, so for our first visit I decided to stick with tacos and some flautas which are corn tortillas rolled with meat inside. I loved the guacamole and how it was full of flavor and not onions! I definitely want to come back to try the tortas which are Mexican sandwiches and I also want to try some more from the gringo menu which made me chuckle.   The staff was very friendly at pinches tacos. I came back to get my husband some food to go and the owners and employees all remembered me and were open to my crazy little jokes and laugh and smiled the whole time.",

There were about 5 tables, but two of them were in front of the kitchen, and along the wall where people would stand to place their order. One of the tables off to the side was rather large, and could fit about 8 people. Luckily, there were a lot of tables outside, and one with an umbrella opened up while we were waiting.   I ordered the taco al pastor, while my husband got one as well and a taco carnitas. With a drink, the total came to just over $11. The fountain drinks are rather expensive at $2.75.   When the tacos arrived, I think that we were both a bit surprised at their size. They were about 4-inches in diameter. They looked really good though, and came with a lime wedge. We dug in, and the flavor was really good. Nice chunks of seasoned meat, with fresh cilantro, salsa and onions. The tortillas were also very flavorful.  It was fun sitting outside and watching everything that was happening around us.  I don't eat very much, but next time I would need to order 2 tacos, and my husband would get at least 3. Might try a burrito next time.",

Beyond this somewhat unusual variety, they've got the basic bases covered: asada, adobada, al pastor, pollo, etc. There's also a mole taco, and a nopal variety. Get adventurous with your taste buds here, because all the ingredients seem very fresh and the preparation is keen. Other than said tacos, I will say you should try the asada fries because they are ridiculous. Think Mexican poutine.  Interior space is nothing special. Pick your tacos, get a place holder, find a place to sit (outside, probably) and they'll deliver. They don't have any brand hot sauce (so no Tapatio) but their house made is good enough.  They offer Micheladas and beer, as well as Mexican sodas, so find a cool spot and enjoy them tacos while watching the container park go by.",

Meaning a small scoop of rice and your meat on the plate.  No garnishes, side nibblings were fried tortia chips.  It was good though.     My second visit the food was not satisfying. The carne asada was all meat flavored.  It was not seasoned or marinaded enough.  Again, the rice was a scoop.  Not enough cheese or sour cream and quacamole on the plate which I had to order as an add on.  The salsa was watery and basically made like tabasco sauce style.  The side fried tortia chips wete a headcount of 5.  My Kiddos' dishes were put together like a school cafeteria lunch - no heart in it.  Their fries were barely salted with small over cooked broken fries.  Our food was served at our table but we had to ask for ketchup, for more hot sause salsa, and napkins.  I won't be coming back to this restaurant.",

We had a selection of other tacos. All nice but pretty standard. Pollo was a stand out one and the Carne Asada Fries were pretty bad ass but mainly because of their fresh guac. The best guacamole  hands down.   We got the fish taco on the side just to try and it ended up being the nicest thing we ate. So many flavours. I am in my happy place.",

Secondly, the prices are pretty low for Las Vegas.  Thirdly, the pinto bean sopes are some of the BEST I've ever had. I love sopes. Love them. The texture of the Pinches sopes was perfect, not soggy and not rock hard like at many places (even in Mexico). I took one bite of my boyfriend's and had to go back in and order a whole one just for myself.  The nopal taco is pretty good too, but five stars for the sopes! When they're so good, why would you even want to order anything else?",

If you want to play it safe like I did, chose the Pollo, Al Pastor, and Asada tacos. They were excellent, and their habanero hot sauce was very spicy, but the heat does not linger.    Ambiance is very settle and relaxing. Prices are fair for the amount you get, and I would say that you wont regret spending your time and money at this place.

And when I asked for some \"real hot sauce\" they responded with \"We're Mexicans, of course we have something spicy enough for you!\" It all sounds great right? Big menu, little bit of everything from authentic to Gringo. But overall, I was majorly let down when it came to the food.  Pricing, decent. Service, stellar. Food, bland, average and needs work. I dined here with my boyfriend, and his kids who are 16 and 17. We got a variety of things from chicken tacos, al pastor tacos, carne asada torta, cheese enchiladas, and some chips and salsa.  First off, chips and salsa were good and so was the side of super hot sauce. The taste lingered for hours, and I would buy it alone if I could. (wait can I?)  Anyway, the chicken tacos were eh. The al pastor tacos can't compare to any of the tacos on the Q's taco challenge ventures. The carne meat was good, but the torta was a bit spongy. My enchiladas looked like they were about to take the cake, but again, eh. BLAND with no flavor. Stuffed full of cheese, with the potential to be bomb, and just ended up being a disappointment.  I felt bad because everyone there was so kind and on their game. But I literally wanted to hit a drive thru on the way home.  Maybe I eat too much Mexican food straight from LA, or maybe I am picky. Probably a bit of both, but either way- takes more than average tacos to impress me.",

Really nothing other than dry meat wrapped in a tortilla. Fail.   The salad was even more disappointing. There wasn't much lettuce, mostly cabbage and the portion was so tiny!!

    "text": "Such a great night getting to know the new Container Park!  I was very happy with the entire evening and wanted to end it on an even better note with some food from one of the new joints.  We decided on Pinches Taco.  One, because the name was awesome and two, I heard the food was great!  It's in the north east corner of the Container park.  Just like all the stores in the park, it's a small joint, however, offers a lot of seating and tables right outside.  When I visited the location, it was pretty heavily staffed.  I didn't have to wait in line at all and trust me, there were a lot of people, being the grand opening weekend.  The staff was super friendly, everyone greeted me and other customers.  Service was remarkably fast!  Might have had something to do with opening weekend :) Awesome!  There was a lot going on in the menu, so I just settled on Pinche Combination plate for $8.95.  You can choose Any 3 tacos from the menu, and it also comes with rice, beans and chips.  I decided on the three most popular things:  Beef (Asada), fish and shredded pork.  Oddly enough, the pork wasn't really the star.  That taco was served with red salsa and chopped onions.  The asada was perfectly seasoned and flavorful, chopped onions, chopped cilantro and green salsa.  The fish (unknown) was THE BEST one for me.  Battered and perfectly seasoned, served with a cabbage slaw and red salsa.  The most amazing fish taco!  Man, those fish tacos alone, are worth the return trip.  I just can't stop thinking about it. I work downtown and think this place is super convenient.  I can't WAIT to get back.  Thanks for sticking around, Pinches Tacos!",

I enjoyed outside seating because its on the ground level of container park and I like to see all the activity going on in the park while im eating. The price point is excellent. By the way, they had to remove the \"pinches\" in the sign outside. Im not sure why, I thought it added humor to the place",

    "text": "Second stop on mini food tour of the Container Park.  We shared a combo plate of three tacos with chips and rice and beans.  For the tacos, we picked the al pastor, asada, and carnitas.  All three were good, but too drippy/runny to be great.  (Warning: Be prepared to make a big mess!)  The highlight was the horchata which was the cinnamon-iest I've ever tasted, and I mean that in a good way.  However, a word of advice.  As those of you may have tried the silly cinnamon challenge will know, cinnamon does not dissolve in water.  That means that all the tiny particles of ground cinnamon sink to the bottom pretty quickly.  Just be aware of that, and give it a good stir pretty often with your straw to avoid a sip of cinnamon sludge.",

And why do they put orange grease (and it is grease, not chili powder) on their corn???  What a shame to all real Mexicans who know real Mexican food!

The line was pretty long, but considering the length of it, they kept it moving really fast. The staff is all very friendly and they have a really good variety on the menu. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to be brought out to us, and they'll even bring it upstairs, which is nice.   I ordered the chicken tacos which come with onions, cilantro, and salsa. They were really, really good. It tasted very fresh and flavorful. The rice and beans were also good. My friend ordered fish tacos and those also looked really good.  My only major gripe is that the drinks are pretty expensive, bottled or fountain. The fountain drinks only come in one size and it's pretty small. It's somewhere around the size of a solo cup, maybe slightly bigger.  Otherwise it's a great place. Definitely check it out!",

Order came out wrong, but my husband was hungry so he didn't say anything. The older man that served our food rudely insisted that's what he ordered.... It wasn't. Anyways, he then goes to scoop up the metal stands with table numbers(a few at the table), knocks them over, and they ALL fall onto my husband plate. Like food all over the table. Big mess. Gross metal signs in the food. Our entire table was kinda surprised that he proceeded to scoop them up off my husbands food, say \"I meant to do that\", and then walk off. Um, ok. Luckily it wasn't my plate cuz I definitely wouldnt have wanted to eat that. Anyways, lost future business from us, plus our friends that saw the incident were majorly turned off. Shocked that this is a family owned business. You think they'd realize how important customer service is. Anyways, there's way better places to eat at the container park. I recommend the Perch( super customer service and great food!) and highly recommend avoiding this place.",
