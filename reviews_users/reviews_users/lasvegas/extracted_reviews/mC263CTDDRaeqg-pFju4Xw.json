I was very disappointed because my son and I were very hungry and I even drove there to pick it up.  The worker there must not take pride in making pizza. If I see a burnt pizza I would not box it up and pass it up as food.   Are there any good pizza in town?",

Highly recommend the chicken wings and also if you check in through yelp app you get a free order of garlic bites which were also really good. Have been here multiple times and is always our go to spot for pizza/wings, definitely worth trying out and im sure it will become your go to spot as well!

The server who helped us, I believe his name was Harry, was very kind and accommodating. He reminded us that we had the option to get free garlic Parmesan knots by checking in on yelp, which were delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered the 16 inch pizza special that comes along with 12 wings and fries. The pizza had great crust, great sauce, great cheese and toppings. The medium wings we ordered were crispy and very saucy. I left the establishment feeling satisfied and I can't wait to come back again!",

The first time I ordered (carry out), I ordered a cheese and meatball pizza, but the pizza seemed to rather be topped with ground beef instead. Now the second time I ordered, the older delivery driver had such a bad attitude to the point where I wanted to tell him to take his pizza back and get off my property. My bill was $26 and change, however, I only had two $20 bills. I asked if he had change, which he did and that was great! He gave me a $10 and two $5's, which naturally adds up to $20. So in turn, I gave him my $20. Then, I proceeded to give him a $20 and two $5's, adding up to my bill plus a tip. The driver then FREAKED out. He was so enraged and told me that I needed to give him $40 and then he would give me $13 back. That was the conclusion we ended up getting to because I just couldn't argue or explain the situation to him anymore. The whole time we were communicating, his voice was raised. I was at the door with him for about 10 minutes and it was a very uncomfortable experience for not only myself, my dog, but the children that were also inside.",

They sell pizza by the slice and I'll just say that you won't be disappointed in their pizza as well. The pricing is really good, especially for the quality of food here. I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu! I highly recommended this place.",

Not only is the pizza great but the customer service they put into it makes it even better. I get the 2 slices and a drink special for $6 and with the amount of food you get it's a steal. Great place and I will be a regular customer.",

I ordered pizza with pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, & ricotta cheese and also wings with garlic parmesan flavor. I normally like my pizza crispy and crunchy but I think maybe the grease might of made it soggy. I even attempted to throw it in the oven to get a little crunchy but it didn't really work. The wings were good but lacked a little garlic flavor. The bottom on my foil was also covered in grease. Everything was just super greasy! They were generous with the toppings and I think I will give this place a try again. Maybe it won't be as greasy if we dined in instead of ordering delivery.",

He went to help us setting up extra table to accommodate everyone, then came back with the menu for us to peruse and decide. It's a worry free, no pressure environment. Once you're ready you just have to go to the counter to make your order.  As I started this review, we had the brother's special pizza, medium calzone, and garlic balls. Everything is delicious!

There were other places that we tried and claimed to be \"NY style\". Some were almost and some were way off. First of all, the crust should have the dry look not shiny and it shouldn't have a thick crust. About 1 inch away from the sauce and cheese. The bottom of the pizza should also have that dry flour charred look as well. Like a crusty rustic bread and not oily. It should have 1/4 inch thickness, crispy, and pliable enough to make that fold. Their sauce is slightly thick with a hint of sweetness and not acidic. This pizzeria has it!  We're so happy and will order here regularly.",

Fortunately for us, it's over 20 miles from our house so we won't be tempted to come here every day.   The staff was attentive, helpful, and friendly. We are greeted upon entering. He asked us if it was our first time and when we replied yes, he told us about the free garlic balls when you check in on yelp. So after checking in we took a seat and looked over the menu and the many specials. We settled on pizza, fingers, a 2 liter and added fries.   The garlic balls were so good we couldn't stop eating them. Then out came our chicken fingers and fries. The chicken was perfect and the ranch was amazing! I'm a ranch snob of sorts and this was one of the best I've had in the city. The barbecue sauce and medium buffalo sauce were good too.   Our pizza came out shortly after that and it was good. It's not the best pizza we've had (Di Fara's in Brooklyn is the best), but for Vegas it's good. The amount of food you get for the price is a steal! We had leftovers for the next day. When we are on this side of town again, we'll be stopping in again.",

They came out to our table several times to make sure that we were satisfied with the food and that we didn't need anything else . We ordered the $15.99 special which consists of a 16in 1topping pizza as well as 12 wings . We received free garlic knots for checking in with yelp once we arrived . my son doesn't drink soda so he was given a free bottle of water. I can't stress enough how absolutely incredible our service was but the food was even better. Much better than I expected . We'll be long time customers for sure. I already spread the word  . Great food and great service",

They do everything right from cooking wings(ridiculously good wings here) well done automatically to toasting the roll for your philly (off tha chain) They also got here in about half the time that they said it was gonna be. We've ordered from them 3 times and all 3 times were seriously amazing. Good work guys we'll be back",

Not only was I waiting there for 30 mins but when I finally asked if there was crushed pepper and parmesan in there they said yes. 1 pack of each in each box (2 boxes). Am I a joke lol whatever man.",

    "text": "It was ok. Honestly, there really isn't much difference between pizza places so what it really comes down to is the little things. Maybe I'm being overly critical but I can't help but be bothered about the sauces. I made an online order. Each sauce is small price but there's still a price. So, I get there a little early and do my yelp check-in and find that they offer free garlic knots with your first yelp check-in. Cool but I can't believe someone actually pays for them. Great that they offer something free but it's literally pizza crust with clarified butter on them. That's it. Kind of like eating a box full of crust which maybe someone else likes but crust is one of my least favorite parts of eating pizza. So, that's why I ordered sauces that cost extra. I was a little early and my order wasn't ready yet. No problem. But, 3 others came in with orders they called in. All 3 of them asked for sauce. I don't think they paid for sauce. They all asked for ranch and the cashier gave them all this giant tub of ranch. I actually PAID for ranch and I get a little rinky dink cup that was barely enough. Really not a huge deal but it did kind of bother me and so then the problems with the pizza stood out. Two things I noticed right away. First, the pizza seemed undercooked...like a lot. It was still a little doughy. Also, I got a basil topping. The basil was WHOLE LEAVES. The flavor of basil is only released when its cut so there was no basil flavor. Also, it's a cheap type of basil. I could have gotten a different topping but was really hoping to get that good savory flavor. Nope plus it was undercooked. I'll pass. Just little things that didn't seem worth the 20 bucks for a small personal size pizza.",

The guy at the cashier asked how many people I was feeding (three) and recommended their specials. They have a Large 1-topping (18 inch) pizza and 20 wings for $27.99. And if you check-in (first timers), they give you their popular garlic knots for FREE! Let me say that the portion was very giving, not just a sampler; picture soft warm knotted bread bathed in a pool of garlic and butter. And the wings were pretty good as well. Good plump chicken wing size. You can mix up the flavors (no limit). We selected four flavors: Garlic Parmesan, Lemon Pepper, Medium Spice, and Teriyaki. I'd recommend the Garlic Parmesan and buffalo. We've been back twice and they have not disappointed.",

Brother's pizza had no issues figuring out how to get to my house, so any time I call them I don't have to re-explain how to get to my house which makes things convenient. #2 the food is great.

Let me tell you, they have definitely perfected their #LemonGarlic flavored wings! Extra crispy and extra meaty.   They brought out some #Medium flavored wings also. The medium is always the test for me. If you can make good medium wings, I will take it that you know wings. These didn't disappoint either. Crispy and extra saucey, I enjoyed each bite.  But wait there's more.. They have a full menu that will blow your mind.  Think of an Italian meal, they got it! Click the link to check out all the info including menu items, hours of operation and location.  I also tried their loaded Stromboli and their Zeppolis which were both amazing.  Will definitely come back soon to try their other wing flavors. If anyone wants to meet me for wings, I'll accept the invite.  These were great!  **Shout out to @food_dude_702 for the invite and Harry for taking care of me on my visit.   #AntonioIsFly #Wings #ChickenWings #Fit #Fitness #FollowMe #LasVegas #Home #Foodie #WingFest #Travel #BrothersPizzaLV",

Our order included an 18' 2 topping pizza that included 15 wings,  8 chicken fingers, and a 2 liter of Coke. The chicken wings & fingers were crispy and were coated generously with buffalo sauce and to top it off they served it with homemade ranch. The pizza was crispy crust and had great flavor. We checked in on Yelp and also received FREE garlic knots. YUM! The food was EXCELLENT and the customer service was AWESOME. This is our NEW FAVORITE dinner spot!",

I told the cashier that I would buy something if they allow me to use it. But not only did they say I didn't need to buy anything but they offered me a free bottle of water and he knew that I was not dining in. So right off the bat I had a good experience after my daughters class was over I decided to take her to eat. We  found out that the food was as excellent as the service. Not only was it absolutely delicious but a medium pepperoni pizza was just under 10 bucks which is extremely affordable.  I definitely recommend if you're in the area to stop by or you want to have a pizza night",

Their ranch is very good as well. I would say their wings are pretty much on par with Wing Stop which I really like and it's a much closer option than any wing stop.  The pizza on the other hand was one of the worst I've had. Really floppy and in a way soggy in the middle. The crust was pretty good but the interior of the pizza was not good at all. Flavor of the ingredients was average and I couldn't taste the sauce much. We ordered a half pepperoni and jalapeno and the other half some kind of Supreme. I was hoping it would be good cold but it was still the same texture. I'll definitely get their wings anytime I have a craving but I wouldn't recommend the pizza based on what we had.  The garlic knots are really good too and for 3 bucks it's a steal.",

My wife wanted me to find a pizza place for one meal on this Vegas trip, and this is what I came up with.  We were not disappointed.   When we arrived they asked if we had been there before.  Then they asked how we heard of them.  When I told them I found them on Yelp, they reminded me of the free order of Garlic Bites for checking in.  Great Deal!  They were very good.  We ordered a pick your own 4 item 14\" Pizza and 12 Honey BBQ Boneless Wings with some Ranch Dressing.  On the Pizza we had white sauce, chicken, bacon, garlic, and pineapple.  It was very good, crust and all.  The Boneless Wings were very tender and tasty.  We just ate at Buffalo Wild Wings a day earlier and I preferred the Wings at Brothers over BWW.  My wife absolutely loved the Ranch dressing that they use.  When we ordered water to drink, they gave us each a bottle on the house. The two employees were very nice and helpful.  The only thing negative that I can say is that one of the employees is a New England Patriots fan.  Go EAGLES!!!!!",

If you're looking for movie night pizza or munchies pizza OMG this pizza is definitely fitting the bill!! I cannot wait to go back and although it was sooo much pizza once it's all gone you wish it wasn't!! It is greasy but that's how i like it because it's cheesy and has just the perfect amount of meat on it! So well worth it and now you got a fan in us!!! Thank you for everything!!",

This gem popped up as the new and hot spot in the area. Nothing but amazing 5-Star reviews and delicious looking pictures, so we had no choice but to try it and it definitely didn't disappoint.   We ordered their special that included a 18\" 1-topping pizza and 20 wings for $25.99. We also ordered fries for $1.99 and we received an order of garlic bites for free with our Yelp check-in.   The pizza was delicious. Crispy and cheesy. Just like an amazing New York pizza. For the wings we got mild and garlic parm. It was perfectly cooked. Big and crunchy. The mild sauce was tasty and the garlic parm was amazing. The garlic flavor was on point! The fries was crispy and cooked to perfection. For $1.99, you got more than your money's worth. It came in a big container. The garlic bites was also delicious. Crunchy bottom, soft bread and tasty flavor. Such a perfect pair to their marinara sauce. The marinara sauce was very flavorful. Just the right amount of spices. Oh, they're ranch is homemade and delicious!   Totally pleased with this place. From the phone encounter, in person pick up experience and food, they deserve every star possible. Such a friendly and amazing family ran restaurant. Keep it up Brother's Pizza and thank you for coming to the Southwest! My family and I will definitely be back!",

Will definitely be ordering those again. We ordered a half cheese pizza with amazing flavors and a half Brothers Special Pizza for our first time, and both didn't disappoint. The pizza was thin crust, but just enough dough around the edges. Their prices were pretty reasonable too. Would definitely order from here again!",

In my experience, the website did not provide updates for delivery time, rather it just stayed on \"confirmed\".   Ordered a 14\" pizza, plain wings (well done) with medium on the side, and garlic balls.   Garlic balls were good and for the price, hard to beat. I ordered marinara sauce with the garlic balls, but got ranch instead. Wings were not quite as crispy as I thought well done would be. I ordered sauce on the side to make sure they were not soggy by the time they were delivered. Medium sauce was very good and would highly recommend. The pizza, to be honest, didn't wow me. It was very doughy, and lacked flavor. I had to throw it in the oven at home to get the crust to get a slight crisp, otherwise it would have been the same consistency as Costco pizza.    Not sure I'll order from here again.",

They even offered to carry it to my car for me.   Their prices are great and their food is very good.   I will be trying some of their other menu items in the future.    It appears to be a  family operated establishment and they really do strive to offer great food, service while being friendly in their efforts to make your meal and visit satisfactory.    Give them a try!",

Although it was discounted they did not skip out on the quality. We also got an order of garlic balls which were so delicious I will be thinking about them for days. And they were FREE with check in! The marinara that came with them was second to none. The last thing we ordered was some chicken wings. Lemon garlic and spicy honey bbq to be exact. The wings were some of the best wings I have had from ANYWHERE in a long time. They flavor them so outstandingly! The spicy honey BBQ was the better choice for me- so savory they were! they had just the right kick but also gave that sweetness with the honey BBQ. The lemon garlic was a bit greasy for me. You couldn't really taste the lemon, or garlic.",

This is a good spot to hit after the club, for a mid night snack, or just because. The cashier was extremely helpful and friendly. The best part about it all was that our pizzas came out so fast and hot!! If your looking for some great pizza and at a good price, you need to give this one a try!!

Definitely one of the best pizzas we'd ever had.   \"Special\" was free garlic balls if you checked in on Yelp. This is where I felt they could have done better. The balls were fully cooked and could not absorb the garlic sauce. The sauce with marinara sauce were used with the pizza slice crusts. Yumm!  Free bottles of water!

You get to even choose your pasta on that dish.  My wife had the Spaghetti Meatballs.  We both have lunch for tomorrow!  Very friendly staff.  We dined in and were checked on to make sure we had everything we needed. One of the things we liked the most was that they provided a chilled grated cheese shaker on our table for use throughout our dinner.  I didn't need it on the Marsala, but my wife enjoyed it on her Spaghetti! Another True local LV gem!  And so close to home. We will be back soon!",

Brothers Pizza has another Vegas location but this one is on Rainbow, close to my hood. Very convenient for those who live in the Enterprise area of Vegas.  The menu is impressive and there is so much to choose from. For those who want lunch there are great lunch specials for just under $7, I figured I would venture getting in on that lunch action soon. Everyone in Brothers are super friendly and very helpful.   We ordered the Gyro pizza with cilantro, wings and the garlic balls that came with Yelp Check-In. So check in and get your free balls! Everything was great and they made even better leftovers. The pizza is NY style and the ingredients are quality. The gyro pizza was fantastic, not heavy on the gyro and the fresh cilantro added made the pizza impressive. The  Wings were crisp and the sauces were tasty. The sauces are made in house so that is one reason they are extra good. We ordered the garlic parmesan that had butter welling at the bottom, I dipped my crust in it! We also ordered the mild with a side off hot sauce because my daughter likes them mild. All good! As for the garlic balls with the free check in, they have to be the best free food item on Yelp in Vegas. You get a lot of them and they are soft, hot and full of garlic, butter and parmesan.  What a great addition to Rainbow Blvd and the Enterprise area. Welcome my Brothers!",

We were hungry after a long day and decided we wanted pizza and wings. This place looked delicious and so we drove over and were shocked at all the amazing specials they were running. We were able to get way too much food for 3 people for around 30$, including garlic knots, pizza, wings and drinks.   They make their own sauce here and use a very premium cheese and it comes through in both the quality of the pizza and the taste. I am not a crust person and ate every last bite of my crust on the ginormous slices of pizza they provide. An 18 in was enough to feed all of us, though they do offer both 24inch and 30in pizzas as well.   The best deals though are the lunch specials. Go by and check them out for yourself. You won't be disappointed!",

We were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming kindness of the restaurant owner, whom made certain we were informed about the menu.  Out front on a sandwich board they advertised a special of two slices of pizza with a drink and we added a side garden salad that was enormous and enough for two. When the two slices each of our pepperoni and black olive topped pizza arrived to our table it was huge slices-enough to feed four people--very generous indeed! I had enough to take to work to enjoy for lunch and share with a co-worker.  They are very reasonable, friendly and helpful. The restaurant is clean and quaint, a nice neighborhood place for a family or couple to enjoy. They offer take-out and delivery as well.  This is an awesome place to come to enjoy some appetizing Italian food so bring your appetite and enjoy!",

Customer service: 5/5 Quality: 5/5 Cleanliness: 4/5   Definitely recommend checking them out!! It's a must if you're in the southwest area.",

He carefully asked if this was the first time we came here and explained the disk when we had any question. The food was great, my family even thought this place's pizza is even better than any other franchise such as pizza hut or dominos. The pizza base is not hard or dry but very very soft yet crispy on the edge. The wings are the BLAST honestly, my brothers finished 12 in just minutes. The only issue so far was the spaghetti was a little bit tasteless, maybe because my taste prefers saltier food but you can always add little extra salt to fix it:) the price is totally a steal for the exceptional service and quality. love it!",

With that said,  I moved to the SW part of town and my favorite pizza place in town (Naked City) has a shop closeby.  I have a soft spot in my heart for them because I'm from Buffalo/ They're from Buffalo.  But they've been inconsistant and their service ain't always great.  Enter Brother's Pizza.  I decided to try them out as a recommendation from the Slice App.  They are now in the running for my favorite pizza place in Vegas.  I love their pizza.  It's an extremely solid traditional pizza with a thinner crust but not NYC style necessa-celery.  And still unique in it's own right.  My go-to pizza from Brother's is the 4-topping deal with Pepperoni, Sausage, Jalapeno, and Sun Dried Tomatoes.  OMFG.  And they offer their pizzaa in like 6 or 7 different sizes.  They may be slightly pricier than the local chain pizza spotz but that price difference goes a LONG way.  The quality of their ingredients is great.  It's just a solid, rich, delicious slice of pizza.  And I believe this is a one off - family owned spot. So buy their pizzas now because they're fantastic and you're supporting a small mom n pop shop.  P.S.  this review is based solely on their pizza.  I have not tried anything else there or dined in at their shop.",

The bottom line is that the pizza tasted very good and had great toppings. It was also huge and this will be the first place i will call every time I need pizza for a party with more than 10 people. I don't love that the pizza isn't cut into wedge shaped slices but I guess I don't know how they would do that with pizzas this large without having each slice be about the same overall size as a medium pizza at a regular pizza restaurant. The other menu items are great and the service was friendly and helpful. This is definitely above average pizza",

Their interior decorations is nothing to speak of but their food keeps their business going.   Like what i mentioned, I'm a non-pizza lover. I don't look for it and I don't crave for it. But when my family does, expect us to order delivery from Brother's. We just like pizza that doesn't taste like franchise pizza. It's like the home cooked version of the pizza places in town. Does that make sense?   The good thing too about these types of restaurants is of there's an error to your order, expect them to go above and beyond to make it right. Our most recent one was the first time they made a mistake with the size of the pizza. So by the time they realized it, they made 2 pizzas for us.   I highly recommend any of their pizzas, you can always do half and half. Our kids love the cheesy bread. And I always order their lasagna.   One suggestion.. maybe find a local place that can make real good cheesecake. I don't know if they make their own but when i ordered their strawberry cheesecake it was slightly frozen and the strawberry was not the chunky version but more of a swirl on the cheesecake.",

You can even get these deals ordering online so you can pull in, grab and go, and eat back at work, and there are options for everyone with pizza, salad, hot and cold sandwiches, wings, and tenders, all with a drink. I cannot stress enough how good the pricing is here.  So far, I've tried the eggplant parm lunch special- sandwich is hefty, clocking in at what seems like an entire pound, covered with melted cheese and served with a mountain of fries. This was easily two lunches for me and I didn't even finish the fries. Came back for a slice and wing special, which was nearly  a quarter of a pizza. Also didn't finish this but will definitely be back for more wings and a specialty pie- heads up, they're BOGO half off weekdays 2-5PM. I don't live or work nearby but I will be back.",

They have lots of great selections and combo deals as well. I ended up ordering an 18inch vegetarian pizza and a 32inch meat lovers pizza. I was quoted a wait time for 25 minutes. Not bad!   Upon arriving to pick up, I see lots of great deals posted on the windows. So I'll definitely be ordering again on one of those days.  The staff was super welcoming and friendly and everything was ready to go as I arrived.  I even checked in and got some free garlic knots to give to my employees.   On the wall it shows the pan sizes which is an awesome way of knowing if you have enough or not enough.  The 32inch pizza was huge! Lol and everyone enjoyed it.  I definitely enjoyed the vegetable pizza with ranch.   Garlic knots were good. And I also added a cheesecake for myself.   The owner helped me and took the pizzas out to my car since my order would be a handful. Definitely very thoughtful and friendly!  Will be back to get more pizzas for my staff!  Thank you!",

Their crust is seasoned so well, you can tell it's made from quality flour and seasonings. Thank you guys for keeping us fed and happy, keep up the good work!

I got a $6.99 lunch special with a personal pepperoni pizza and a fountain drink before headin' over to UNLV, and boy was it delicious! I came back today to get another one because this pizza is so damn good! The new management is great and I can tell they care about what they do!",

Good thing Brothers Pizza is open late nights 9am-1am (til 3am on weekends) For their pizzas they range from 10\" to 30\". You can even order each half a different style which is what we did.  We did half 5 cheese and the other half verde pizza. Both were delish. I enjoyed the verde pizza better because it had mostly veggies on it. Their wings were just ok. They have tons of fast food options such as wings, fingers, soups, ribs, stromboli, calzones, salads, burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, and desserts. Amazing service from Harry, he upgraded the size our pizza, thank you! Don't forget to check in to receive your free garlic balls.",

They have the best buffalo wings and Pizza was pretty good that you won't be disappointed. The Garlic balls- OMG! We are so hooked! It's buttery, soft and delicious paired with marinara sauce.

The cashier asked me if I wanted to add toppings so I chose black olives and pepperoni and he didn't charge me extra which was nice. He also asked if I wanted my pizza to be crispy (yes) and if I wanted ranch (heck yes). I read that they make their own ranch so of course I had to try it. There is a fee for the ranch FYI. It's $1 for a pretty decent size container (see pics). The ranch is bomb! I highly recommend getting it. I could seriously drink it if I wasn't concerned about my health. Food is fast to arrive and omg are the slices huge! I was only able to eat 1 slice. The pizza was cooked perfectly, the crust was crispy like how I requested. I do compare my pizzas to the ones from NYC and while these didn't hit quite the spot to ones from NYC, I would still come back. I also ordered a side of fries and they were delicious. I like the fries that have those crispy nuggets on the outside which is exactly what these are. Come check them out!",

The wings are always great, I especially like their Greek salad and the Pesto pasta is incredible.  It is said that you should always find one fault to make a review more realistic, but truthfully I can't think of a one.",

Incredible pizza, huge jumbo slices. So large we both had leftovers.   The staff was very attentive and friendly. I was told to check in to receive a delicious order of the garlic knots.  The sauce on the side was also delicious.   Seeing the wings in person will definitely bring me back. This is some of the best pizza I've had in while.",

The wings are big and really good. They aren't breaded so they are great for low carb eaters. I think my favorite thing there, though, is their fries and homemade ranch dressing.  I could make a meal out of just those! (and I have). The guys there are always friendly and aim to please. They recently updated the inside a bit. It's a small place not offering luxury seating, but it's comfortable and friendly. Their lunch specials are a great deal. They offer a huge variety and most are $6.95 or less. Everything is always freshly cooked. They do a great job! I recommend Brothers to everyone I know.",

    "text": "We're a family that LOVES eating chicken wings and fingers. After doing a little shopping tonight, we decided to grab some wings for dinner, however my wife was craving chicken fingers instead. You know how you Yelp in hopes that you'll discover some fantastic new place? Well that's kinda what happened, except I don't think this place is quite new. Matter of fact, these guys are old school and I mean old school when it comes to the Vegas pizza business. Don't be mistaken, this isn't your ordinary neighborhood pizza joint. When we first pulled up in front of this place we sat in the car for about 10mins. What got us here was the 5star on Yelp, however from the parking lot looking-in it just looked like a pizza joint.   From the moment we walked in their phone was ringing off the hook. People were coming in to pick up orders. As busy as they were, they still greeted us and sat us at the table. Then they brought us cups for the fountain machine without paying a dime yet. Wow.   Now for the food. The True test was the chicken fingers and let me tell you.... excellent!!!! These fingers were all meat and it tasted like fresh chicken. Not sure if they make it themselves or what but again their fingers have to be in my book the top 3 best chicken fingers place in Vegas. On top of great fingers, the wings were just as meaty and perfectly cooked. I can keep going about how great this place was but try it yourself. I would be VERY surprised to hear anything much different then what I've mentioned here. Enjoy!",

We dined in and ordered their special, which was a large pizza and wings for $15, we added a side of fries and only wanted water (which he gave us bottled water at no extra charge!) and also got free garlic bread bites for checking in. It all totaled to less than $20!  The pizza was cheesy and satisfying, wings were juicy and tasty, the fries were cooked perfectly to a nice crisp, and garlic bites were light and chewy. Their ranch and marinara dipping sauces are homemade and sooo delicious. The ranch had a nice garlicky and fresh taste unlike the bottled kind and the marinara had that rich, slow cooked, flavorful taste to it. Our server was not only kind and gave great service, but also so welcoming and grateful to have us there. I love these small neighborhood businesses that take pride in their work and food. Thank you! I'll be back for that marinara sauce with a side of pasta  Everything was great!",

The total bill was $39.48 which includes a delivery charge of $2.50, tax of $3.01, and a tip of 10% (you can choose how much to give the driver from10% to  25%). I aways choose %10, and then give the driver cash, because I am a server also, and cash is king. I am sad to say this was the worst delivery driver I have ever had. Would rather do this review on Grub Hub, as they should know this person basically THREW the food at me and started to walk away before I had a chance to give him the cash. Not sure who he was, as he left so fast, but a picture of the check in included.",

Most places a pizza with that many toppings will cost you a good sum per topping, but here it was like $16. Good size pie ready in 15 minutes and very good although it could have been cooked a wee bit more. The real test in my opinion is how leftover slices taste when eaten cold and I must say it was equally good the next day. Nice crust and fresh  ingredients.  Super friendly service that makes you feel welcome too. A++++++",

    "text": "I just want to say that this place exceeded my expectations to the point where I felt obligated to make my first yelp review. At first glance, this place didn't stand out in my eyes. It seemed like a typical pizza joint with some decent stuff. Then I take a peak at that 5 star rating and it got me curious. What makes this place stand out? So a friend and I had to check it out. We go in and the first thing we get is one of the warmest, most genuine welcomes I've had at an eating establishment. Some of the friendliest and easygoing people without being too overbearing or fake. The cashier then gives us recommendations for 4 slices of pizza, 12 pieces of wings, fries, and a free order of garlic knots when we checked in. The total came out to around $24, so about $12 each for a friend and I. The amount of food was enough for 2 meals for each of us. The quality of everything was amazing. Just go try it out. To put it simply this place has great value, great quality, and great service.",

We didn't feel rushed as we didn't know what we wanted. There were 2 people who had helped us, a younger guy who put in our order for the free garlic balls and an older gentleman who took our order. We were taking it to go, the daily special of pizza wings and a soda for 20 dollars but he recommended the takeout special with just pizza and wings for 15.99 which was actually all we wanted. He gave us a free water as we waited as well. The customer service was amazing and the food was just as good. I even recommended to my friend and she went the same night and loved it just as much. This is our new pizza spot and I'm excited to try all their other menu items.",

They had a nice crisp to them and were not dry whatsoever. Their wings are much better than BWW wings, so if you like wings, come here. The ranch was made in house and you can taste of what seemed to be a hint of garlic. Fries were not disappointing as well. They had a deal to throw in a pizza which was also well worth it. Dough had a soft but crisp crust while the bottom was crispy thin but not like a flatbread. Overall the food is well worth my business, I'll be telling people in the area to definitely try this place out. As well for anybody reading this, go, simply go lol  Service was also very good, I think one of these brothers was taking my order and bringing out the food.",

The workers were VERY attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed! My group checked in and got the garlic balls, we ordered some wings of various flavors (medium, hot BBQ, garlic parmesan, and lemon garlic), and two 18-inch pizzas (Super Mario and Hula Hula).  Well let me start by saying the pizza was huge! I think we were hungrier than we thought because we had so many leftovers (which was great for a late snack LOL). I loved the combination of meats on the Mario Pizza that made it so flavorful. The Hula Hula was also very tasty but I hope that no one can mess up a good Hawaiian style pizza! I thought all of the wings were worth trying but the Hot BBQ was a little too much for me. Not only am I a wimp with spicy foods, but I felt that the flavor was a little compromised. After all was said and done, I realized there was a lot of garlic on everything we ate so my breath was a little bad LOL but I would definitely go back here. I really liked the vibe of the restaurant a lot.",

Be warned if you call to place an order they do have a carry-out special they don't tell you about when you call but you can ask. I would recommend checking your food before leaving the restaurant since I have often had an item left out. The pizza is good, not always worth the hassle.",

Let's just say we were extremely happy with the food. We ordered the #1 special: 1 topping pizza, 12 wings and a 2 liter soda. We also checked in on Yelp and received at order of garlic balls. The food was excellent. The pizza was cheesy and the crust was nice and crunchy. The garlic Parmesan wings was delicious. And the garlics balls were addictive. We will guarantee go back for more.",

Lol I've honestly only had the cheese pizza because I share with my picky toddler, but it's soooo delicious, I can only imagine what a pizza with all the works would taste like.  I've ordered their hot wings with extra sauce and *drool*... never been disappointed. Their ranch is also so creamy and delicious, not like many other places that have watered down ranch \"dressing\", yuck!  I should also mention that I've ordered through DoorDash and my wings have been scorching hot upon arrival.  5/5",

This spontaneous family dinner in this hole in the wall pizza shop has been a far greater experience than those fancy establishments we've wasted our time and appetite in. I am beyond ecstatic to know that this place is right in our neighborhood. Too bad it took us this long to find it but just overall happy that we did. Thank you! We will be back.   Forgot to add, we had the daily special of 16inch 1-topping pizza and 20 chicken wings, chicken parmesan sandwich w/ seasoned fries AND FREE garlic knots when you check in Yelp. The food was outstanding and though we were a party of 3 hungry and ready to eat, I would say it was good for 6people. Trust and believe  your money and appetite will not go to waste!!!!",

It ended up being the same old bland pizza we've found everywhere else is Vegas.  We each ate one piece (of a 16\" to boot!) and threw the rest away.  The only really great pizza we have found in Vegas is at the Chicago Brewing Company in the Four Queens.  Sure wish they'd open up some other locations (we only get down there about 6x a year).",

Not only was the staff friendly over the phone, but in person as well. Ordered the 20pcs chicken wings with fries and the Super Mario with sausage added. Plus the garlic balls. I liked how the garlic balls were bite sized and not too soggy. Check in on Yelp if it is your first time! The fries were still crispy and good by the time I got home despite the steam. The Super Mario was similar to a Supreme pizza and the crust was crispy and cooked just right. The only thing about the pizza was the feta cheese made the it a little dry, maybe adding more of the pizza sauce would've helped. The wings were good, half mild and half garlic Parmesan. Tossed evenly. Overall, I would come back and possibly try some of their other menu items and toppings.",

We ordered a delivery order from door dash, the delivery was fine with time and all but once we opened the food omg! So the wings were cold and had very little sauce on them, they were supposed to be medium heat and had no heat at all probably from the lack of sauce on them. Then we tried the super Mario pizza.....yikes! It was so greasy! Also we thought it was weird to have feta cheese on a pizza and we were so excited to try it out,  when we saw the few select crumbles scattered over a 16\" pizza we were not impressed, why even put it on. The pizza was also not hot when we received it either. All we ordered was a medium pizza and 12 wings and it was $40+ so not worth the price. If I could.... I would ask for our $$ back. I believe you get what you pay for and am totally fine paying a high price for something if it is worth it, this place is NOT worth it! Don't think we will be ordering from here again unfortunately",
