A Box Combo, add an extra side of their famous sauce, and a large sweet tea that is some of the best sweet tea I've found beyond what I make myself...and you've got a surefire lunch or fast dinner that always satisfies. Add in always friendly customer service and you can't go wrong by stopping here.",

    "text": "It would never occur to me to order chicken fingers under any circumstance, but my wife practically lives on them.  So, a couple of years ago, we discovered Raising Cane's, and we do not EVER leave Vegas without stopping at the one near the Las Vegas Outlet Mall a couple of miles south of Mandalay Bay.  They basically serve chicken fingers and a chicken sandwhich with sides such as crinkle-cut fries, cole-slaw (better than KFC), and their Texas Toast for which I would make the drive to Vegas anytime.  The dipping sauce is what, for me, makes it great.  It is some kind of spicy cajun concoction.  The chicken fingers literally fall apart in your hands they are so tender.  Anyone want to become rich instantly?? Open one of these bad boy's in Orange County!",

    "text": "I guess as far as Raising Cane's goes, I'm in the minority looking at all the 5-star reviews this place has been receiving.  For the unfamiliar, this is a fast food joint that specializes in one thing, and only one thing - chicken fingers. That's about all there is to this place. All they have are chicken fingers, fries, bread, their signature Cane's sauce (and basic sauces like ketchup), and drinks. Nothing else. There is ONE KIND of chicken finger, so if you're expecting a place like Buffalo Wild Wings where you can go in and get your chicken cooked in one of 15-or-so types of sauce, go back to sleep. Variety is the spice of life, and Raising Cane's doesn't have it.  The staff here are always friendly and have a positive attitude, however I find it annoying the way they ask for your name if you're dining in (this is so they can call you up when your order is ready.) Can't they just give a number like other fast food restaurants?   And then comes the biggest blow of all - the food isn't that good. These chicken fingers are so oily inside that the outer breading practically hangs off of them. I have heard of people from the office I used to work at getting sick here, and after having tried these fingers, it isn't hard to see why. The fries are nothing worth writing home about, and I think they could easily have come out of a frozen Ore-Ida box. The so-called special Cane's Sauce is just fry sauce with a few extra spices thrown in (and it isn't special and unique in any way when you consider that the Chicken Now place in the nearby Outlet Mall has practically the exact same sauce.)   For your chicken needs, go elsewhere. This place has a limited menu, lackluster food, and nothing that really makes it stand out. Nearly any other fast food restaurant has better chicken products and more menu selections.",

I've come to learn some people taste buds are way different or haven't been around too much to explore different restaurants out there in the world. There are much better fried chicken chain-restaurants out there  which is much more fulfilling and worth while. Positive thing I can say, it's a nice clean building and was kind of empty when I went in.",

This location does seem to get busier than the Flamingo location since it's in the outlet mall shopping center. Not your typical chicken fingers as they are fresh and not overly battered. Batter often flakes off since it is light and just enough. Fries are thinner crinkle cut and crispy. Service is normally excellent, though did have a bit of a wait when I ordered a jug of sweet tea once, but that was a rare exception. Always friendly employees. And if you like sweet tea, they have one of the best.",

That's bible! My daughter, started working for this same store and she was an employee for a year until she just left to venture on into her future as a full time student in MD.  She loved working for Raising Canes, it also helped that she worked with the best crew ever, from the crew member's up to the managers who worked just as hard...this place is family oriented inside and outside, from the warm welcome of \"welcome to Raising Canes where the Chicken is kick'n and the sauce is boss!\" or as my daughter and one of her crew member's say (they made this one up of course) \"my chicken be lick'n, my chicken be kick'n, my chicken is off the chain, and whenever I'm think'n 'bout my chicken, I'm think'n 'bout at raising Cane's!!\"  by employee Alexis A. and Amber S. & manger Joseph ! Woohoo Raising Canes in the house! (This Franchise out of Nevada is the best to work for ever ) great experience for my daughter 2nd job ( because she had two and was going to school, you go girl!) I do hope they open a store in southern California; I sure would work for them in AZ to California since Cali's where I'm from... Hey Jason if you all (marketing Team) are reading this (Alexis A. mom / #1 store crew den mother wants to work on the crew out in the field !!!)  *** If you haven't tried it yet, you have to try the honey mustard sauce...

It looked so good in the pictures, but they are deceiving! The taste of their chicken fingers were so blah that I've had better.  I love chicken fingers and I know that they're suppose to be crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. These were not crisp or juicy.  The price for the combos are a-ok as to why I didn't deduct even more stars. Their sauce that you dip the chicken fingers in is really tasty, that's probably what made me tolerate the chicken fingers more. The coleslaw was pretty good and the fries are good.  The bread it comes with is delish!  The sweet ice tea is sooo refreshing especially with the weather they have in LV. It's unlimited drinks if you dine in.  Would I come back here?

I mean, wow, we were so hungry, so we ordered:  Cainiac Combo: 6 chicken fingers, cole slaw, 2 special sauce, french fries, texas toast and a large drink (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/raising-canes-las-vegas-3#FjvP2zipmRzAiCj7LdHOFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rais...</a>)  Kid's Meal: 2 chicken fingers, french fries, 1 special sauce and an apple juice box.  The guys who work here are super friendly and definitely work hard!  As soon as you find a seat, they make sure your table is wiped down.  A few minutes later, someone will walk around with food and call your name out.    French Fries - They tasted like the Ore Ida-cut fries from the frozen bag.  It was cold, soggy and some fries were frozen.  After 4 pieces of french fries, I was done.  Chicken Fingers - They were actually juicy and seasoned well, but that sauce was nasty.  I wasn't sure how a lot of people could like this sauce because it just tasted like mayo, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and some garlic powder. It really had a heavy mayo taste and it actually turned me off.  When I walked up to the guy and asked him for BBQ sauce, he said they didn't have any but had Louisiana hot sauce.  So, I mixed hot sauce and ketchup and dipped my chicken fingers and it was definitely better than the weird sauce they gave us.   Cole Slaw - Oh this was gross and had a weird taste.  I think it was loaded with MSG or something because I got thirsty all of a sudden.  I hope they can get KFC's recipe for cole slaw!   Texas Toast - Holsum's Texas Toast from your neighborhood grocery store can be found here at Raising Cane's!   Nothing really special about their toast here, except it's soft and buttery. I've had better garlic toast at my local diner.   Overall, the service is awesome and the workers are super friendly.  It has a family-friendly vibe and it's a perfect place for soccer moms to take the kids here after the game.  After all, the food is cheap and so is the quality.",

I also love their soft drinks! not a lot of food places serve crushed ice, but this place sure does, and I LOVE THAT!   I ordered their 6 pc. chicken. the sauce was good, the bread was not all that! the middle of the bread needed more garlic sauce or something!!

This is literally the first place I eat at every time I come to Vegas, which is around 3 times a year. Their chicken strips/tenders are so perfectly flavored and fried. It's always moist and unlike any chicken nugget/fillet/strip I've ever had ANYWHERE.   Service has always been great...I'm sure not everyone loves to work here or probably has something better to do. But you can't tell by their face and service unlike many fast food places.  Their sweet tea is not overly sweet unlike Christ-Fil-A which is a bit too sweet for me.",

It was probably one of the worst chicken strips I've ever had. Fries were just whatever too. Also we used the drive thru and specifically asked for no Texas toast on any of our orders and to replace it with other sides. We confirmed this at the window, and of course we all got double Texas toast. Pretty ridiculous. Also they don't have ranch or bbq sauce so you're forced to eat the chicken with their house sauce or ketchup. Basically if you like chicken strips...don't go here.",

But, I was soooooreely disappointed. Okay, exaggerating a little, but the main star - the chicken tenders - was the most disappointing part of the box! We got the box that comes with 4 tenders, Texas toast, slaw, and crinkle cut fries. And, of course, their special sauce. The toast was good 'cause it was salty and buttery (fat) and the slaw was fine. I also enjoyed their sauce, and really would not have eaten the chicken without it. The chicken, though, was DRY and the fries were soggy. Not to mention the drive thru was pretty slow at midnight! Only 1 or 2 cars in front of us and it took about 15 minutes to order and get our food.",

This concept of a small amount of menu items dominated by chicken was experienced by this Yelper many moons ago in Tallahassee during my days as a student at The Florida State University.  Guthrie's was the name I believe.    Pun intended:  I didn't experience a religious revival of my soul after eating here.    The 3 finger combo (pic included) should be appropriately changed to the middle finger combo.  3 chicken fingers, fries, buttered toast (more butter is needed), and a 22 ounce soft drink for $7.    The chicken was nothing to write home about.  The word Ore-Ida crossed my mind when devouring the fries.     I can write more about my meal here, but why take up more of Yelp's space...........",

Bf and I were faced with a dilemma: eat two buffets in one day or get a snack and then close out the night with a buffet. Me? I was down for the former, but he wanted to save room for Green Valley Ranch's Feast Buffet, so we chose to get a snack instead. We hit the location near the outlets, because that was closest to Henderson. It was 2 pm on a Friday and the booths were all full, but the tables in the middle were open.  They basically have chicken finger combos that come with Ore Ida-cut fries, 2/3/4/6-pieces, a piece of buttered-and toasted-to-perfection Texas toast, a 21-ounce drink (self-serve), a small container of coleslaw and a small container of mystery dipping sauce (looks like a combo of Thousand Island dressing with Ranch). The bf and I shared a #1, which was a 4-piece, it was about $7 and it was the perfect snack before a buffet three hours later. We added another soda for $1.59, and I like that they don't try to gouge you on the drinks just because the combos seem really affordable to me.  The chicken was crispy and moist, and it wasn't overpowered with batter. There was a generous portion of fries and they were fried to just the right touch of golden goodness. The slaw was tasty, as was the dipping sauce. Sweet tea is always too sweet for me, so I usually do about 1/2 sweet and 1/2 unsweetened for that perfect combo. I love that they used crushed ice and they serve Coke, not Pepsi. The place is clean, service is really friendly. Great place to grab a snack if you can't decide on what to eat and don't want to pay luxury casino prices.",

Extra sauce costs more which isn't cool.  Coleslaw wasn't very tasty.  Would go back for chicken and Texas toast for sure",

I was hesitant at first because of the concept...just chicken strips..but boy was I pleasantly surprised!   First of all, the atmosphere was great! Lots of movie posters on the walls and plenty of pictures of Cane. The staff was lively and the place was packed for lunch. We ordered the standard offering of chicken strips, fries & Texas toast.   The strips were marinated and very tasty even without the sauce. It is the sauce that puts this place over the top. I will definitely try to make a return trip next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "A fast food review... GOOD FAST FOOD.  I honestly try to stay clear of places with drive thrus, but you can't pass up regional fast food that doesn't exist in your neck of the woods.  This chain only serves \"chicken fingers\" and its mainly based out of the south. The two closest to the west coast are both located in Vegas. They boast of the \"fresh, never frozen\" deal, and you can totally tell.  The chicken strips really taste homemade, the white meat is juicy and the chicken is dipped in batter by hand. They cook them to order so the strips come out fresh, hot, and crispy, seriously like they were made in someone's kitchen. The menu is limited (they focus on the chicken fingers) and meals come with crinkle fries, texas toast, and their signature dipping sauce.",

But thank you Yelp for this as I have been to vegas numerous times, but never knew about this place. Who doesn't love chicken fingers, but many places will sell the already made and processed ones, but this place is legit.  The fries are great, coleslaw is delicious,  and the chicken fingers just melt in your mouth.  Try it for lunch or as a snack....I got the \"the box\". They also have their own sauce and its a combination of thousand island and something delicious.",

It was very vibrantly decorated and very well lit. We went there straight from the airport so it was a good place to wake up and get a bite to eat.  We each ordered the 3 piece meal which was brought out pretty quickly. The chicken was fantastic. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The dipping sauce was really good. Gave a good twist on standard chicken. Came with some decent crinkle fries and fantastic texas toast. My favorite part of the meal was the sweet tea. I dont usually even like sweet tea but I Loved it at Canes.  A new go to whenever in vegas.",

    "text": "UPDATE 12/15/16: The management contacted me following my previous bad review. They apologized profusely multiple times and invited us to come back and try again and we accepted. We dined in a few weeks ago on a Saturday for lunch before a movie. While we didn't get to try out the drive-through service, the dine-in was fantastic. The employees were all very friendly, the food was fresh and hot, and the inside was clean and decorated quite nicely (if a bit eccentric). We will definitely be coming back as the management has successfully convinced me our previous issue was a one-time fluke.    PREVIOUS REVIEW: I'm new to Las Vegas and I'm a UNLV student. The school gets Raising Cane's catering for nearly every event and it's always delicious. When I found out there was one near my new apartment, I was excited to try it.   The first day, I stopped by at about 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon. I went through the drive through and it took nearly 10 minutes for my food to come out. When it did, it wasn't very warm either. I chalked it up to a bad day and didn't say anything.   Tonight, my boyfriend went to get take out for dinner. Once again, it took forever for our food to come out and since there was such a line behind him, my boyfriend didn't check the order before he left the restaurant. We ordered a combo and asked that instead of fries we get a second slice of toast, instead, we got double fries and no toast, even though the receipt had our order written out correctly. Also, I ordered a 3 piece chicken strips and instead, I got closer to 2 1/2. The third strip was basically a glorified chicken nugget. I really should have taken a picture.   Overall, I would definitely recommend Raising Cane's for their food and catering but this particular location has issues, especially with to-go and take out. I'd go to another location or check out any of the other restaurants in the mall nearby.",

The True taste test is to try them without the sauce, not at all tasty.  ADD the sauce and they instantly become better! The other negative is that while they are served hot, they are not crispy like they should be. The fries were really salty and the Texas toast buttery and ok.  The service was good and the location clean, the only warning is go with the 3 or 4 piece fingers, anything more than that is too much.  We came, we tried and can move on.....",

I was really looking forward to trying this place out after all the hype.   Walking inside there were tons of people and the line was fairly long but it being right by the outlets could be why it was crowded, just saying lol. The menu wasn't very big, it was quite limited. I expected more variety and more side dishes. I ordered a 3 strip combo which came with fries, bread and special sauce. The chicken was good don't get me wrong but it just didn't blow me away like I thought it would. The strips had a crispy crust which is always a plus, the fries were mediocre nothing special. The special sauce looked like thousand island dressing kind of but it sure didn't taste like it, can't explain the taste but it was a bit peppery but very good. Now the bread was my favorite part of the meal, it looked like it was a grilled hot dog bun of some sort. It was buttery and had a hint of garlic, it was so good!  Overall the food was good, prices were ok and service was good but I feel as though it wasn't the best chicken strips I've ever had. I would go back but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

It is hit and miss as to when they change the oil so the taste of the food is not always the same so just be aware if you come across a place with older oil being used, your food will taste different then if you catch a place with fresh oil.

I like not working around the bone for my food, plus there's often leftover meat on those bones. The toast was delicious too! I ate more than my fair share of toast. We ordered a Pan of Crinkle-Cut Fries, which is essentially five orders of fries. Those complemented the rest of the meal so well! We chose a great place for dinner and I suggest anyone else interested in trying it out, does. Definitely making this a priority when I come back to Las Vegas.",

The dipping sauce is their own special recipe. It is tasty with the chicken and the fries. They also have the cutest ketchup packets! The combos I ordered came with soft and fluffy garlic toast, fries, and coleslaw. The fries were not greasy and the coleslaw was crunchy and fresh. I got half sweet tea and regular tea. My husband got the lemonade. Both tasted good and not too sweet. This is a great fast food place for chicken strips in the area.",

So first off the chickens fingers are very good, large, tasty and moist.  That's about where it ends, the texas toast was somewhat soggy, the coleslaw lacks much flavor and the frys were not crispy at all.  The frys either need to spend another minute in the fryer or maybe they're turning orders so fast the oil isn't getting to temperature.  As to the lemonade there must be a lemon shortage you could barely taste any lemon in it.  The cane sauce is good.  Not a place we'll go back too, unless we just bought the chicken fingers.",

Coleslaw tasted fresh and not overbearingly heavy on the mayo.

When I think chicken fingers/tenders, I imagine an overly breaded piece of nothing that is dry and stale.  Not here.  Not at all.  This was nicely breaded and the chicken was amazing.  Who said tenders/fingers are for kids?!  The best part was the sauce.  Most of their meals comes with one or two, but I ordered an extra for 30 cents or something.  I guess the other best part was the freshly brewed sweetened tea.  Brings me back to when I used to live in the South and where sweetened tea is their specialty.",

    "text": "01 Jun 2014, 12:00p  Was looking for something quick to eat, but didn't want to go to any of the fast food chains we have here in LA.  I decided to check out Raising Cane's since it got good Yelp reviews.  Not having paid much attention, I realized after I entered that it's a chicken strips place.  Not really knowing what was best, I decided to order their most popular meal:  The Box Combo  I wasn't quite sure what Cane's Sauce was so I was game and decided to try it.  Had to get Sweet Tea with my combo and a little taste of the South that I like to indulge in when I can.  My order was to go and I dove right in after returning to my hotel.  The chicken strips were a little different than what I would expect from a fast food place, even a diner-like restaurant such as Denny's.  I could immediately tell these were white-meat pieces of chicken.  The batter wasn't anything special, but I appreciate the fact that they don't use formed chicken.  The fries were crinkle-cut which is also different from any other fast food place I've tried.  The Texas toast was probably the best part of the combo.  It was very soft inside and just slightly toasted enough to create a \"skin\".  The cole slaw was pretty good, too.  Needless to say, I pretty much devoured the entire meal as I was fairly hungry.  The sweet tea was just sweet enough, but not overly so.  I would make a trip back to try some of the other combos, but as with most other fast food, I would probably choose a healthier place like Subway first.  The staff was incredibly friendly, though!",

Chicken Tenders - Very tasty, tender and the right size. Juicy and piping hot.  2.  Fries - Great when hot, however if you order to go and bring them home, they need to be properly warmed up.  3.  Sizing - They have all sorts of sizes for the appetite and the prices are reasonable.  Several times I have ordered a tray of the tenders and the fries. I usually go for the 25 piece tenders and find them just not enough...  Clean and Easy toilets, great parking, and fantastic service.   GK says, for fast food, this is a great place to go.",

They also have a kid's meal.   Service are super friendly. Love this place!",

After emailing the company, they reviewed the video and confirmed that our food was substandard. Hopefully we'll love it this time around!  I will NEVER eat here again. For the amount of money we paid, I wish I had taken all the food back and got a refund. I guess my only complaint is the chicken... Which was the whole reason we went!!! We got 3 meals and every single one had dried up, old chicken tenders. This was our first time, this can't possiby be what all the reviews rave about!!! I'm not exaggerating when I say I would not be surprised if these were from the day before. And this was on a Friay night in Vegas!!! Beyond disappointed",

    "text": "I lived in the Deep South for years, where fried chicken and fries are treated as high gourmet. My Alabama hometown of just under 30,000 residents had SEVEN different fried chicken joints, and that didn't include restaurants that also had chicken on their menu. There were 2 of Southern-style chicken finger places--Guthrie's (which has been around for over 20 years) & Zaxby's, another chain down South. Raising Cane's fits that mold.  Southern style fingers are reknown for their crispiness as well as flavor. While the fingers I had at Cane's were thunderously crunchy and volcanically hot (temperature, not spicy), the flavor was not really there compared to the Cane's franchise I had in Augusta, Georgia. I didn't experience the down south flave I craved. Luckily, their sauce was on point. The sauce is a standard at these places--a mayo/ketchup blend with differing doses of black pepper, garlic powder, and worcester. Cane's sauce tasted like home.  Bottom line: Raising Cane's is a chain that tastes like what Southern Style chicken fingers should taste like. A \"Box\" (another recurring combo throughout the South) consists of 4 fingers, fries, cole slaw, 1 sauce, a regular drink and texas toast. I always order an extra sauce (1 ain't enough) and a sweet tea to complete the meal. The toast is to wipe up any excess sauce. Food is cheap (less than $8 for a combo) and service is fast. Make sure to eat it immediately, while the chicken is still hot enough to burn yer mouth. The coleslaw is used to cool down yer wounds.",

I gave my card to pay and when he gave it back, he asked if he could ride in my Benz & asked if I had a boyfriend. Hahaha. I laughed! Then he was talking talk-story with me for a bit while I waited for the car before me to drive away. He was like, \"So how's your day going...Miss Beautiful?\" Then more talk-story again. The car before me was pulling off, so he ended our conversation by saying, \"well if you want, you can hit me up next time, okay?\" And winked at me. LOL!!!  This location NEVER ever messes up my order, which is a big BONUS! They also never take long for me to wait. I think the most I waited was 4 minutes, which is nothing, because that's super quick! I always get my food really fast! Plus, the food is always fresh!!!! Like it's still hot and just cooked, which I love!!!!",

As a frequent visitor of many canes locations, I've often come across workers who seem to only worry about getting food out, whether the order is correct or not. Never having been to this particular store, I did not have high expectations for service, and am only drawn back to canes at all for the food. Luckily, I met the most fantastic employee who was more than helpful, extremely attentive, lively, and one of the best workers I've met in the food service industry. Be sure to look out for Nicole Benavente, she is the hero of this story. Despite the many unruly customers ahead of me, and a hectic atmosphere, I took notice of her kind and friendly attitude throughout the whole line. After servicing many crazy customers, I kept expecting her to be burnt out and just shuffle me through as many employees would, but she remained energetic and made me happy to be there. Normally I prefer to tell managers directly about their employee's great service, but I feel this young lady deserves a public post about how incredible she was. If you see this, thank you, Nicole, you're a great kid and I hope you get more of the recognition you deserve.",

If you're a fan of Chick Fil A you won't be disappointed.  Can't wait for these guys to open a restaurant in Los Angeles.",

The toasted bread is delicious and goes well with chicken and is a nice change from a heavy biscuit.  We are not crinkle fry fans but we have to say they were tasty.  The sauce is super yummy and compliments the chicken.  The lemonade is amazing!!  Tastes like my grandma's.  I wish the had one in the San Francisco Bay Area.  This beats out Chick fil A hands down.",

    "text": "Raising Cane's is a fast-food restaurant chain known for its chicken fingers, and it has some of the best darn chicken fingers that I have ever tried!  Do yourself a favor and order 'The Box Combo' or 'The 3 Finger Combo'. The perfect box comes with Texas toast, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries, Cane's sauce and premium chicken tenderloins. The Texas toast is \"a thick-sliced sesame seeded bun brushed with real butter and garlic salt, grilled on a flat top\". The Cane's Sauce is flavorful and is de-freaking-licious; \"it is tangy with a little bit of spice\". You can dip your chicken tenders, fries or toast into this  sauce for added flavor.  Since there are no locations near my home, I try to stop by Raising Cane's during my trips to Vegas. Granted, these chicken finger boxes won't fill you up like those Vegas buffets, but they are perfect for lunch or to snack on in-between meals. Also, thanks to this location's drive-thru option, Raising Cane's is a definitely a quick and easy choice for food!",

But this was WAY better. Their special sauce, which seems like mayo + ketchup + pepper, doesnt taste like much on its own, but with the chicken, omg Im drooling just thinking about it. The chicken is nicely breaded without being too thick or greasy, the krinkle cut fries arent greasy either and have a nice crunch, the toast is thick and fluffy and nicely flavored without being greasy either. You might be able to tell Im surprised by the lack of grease.   Other than the food, the place was a little messy, but it was pretty busy and they seemed short staffed. But totally willing to overlook that with their awesome food! Cant wait to go back the next time Im in Vegas!",

There's something that keeps drawing me back to Cane's. Maybe it's the sauce. Maybe it's the super-moist chicken. It's probably not the always-friendly and borderline overly-enthusiastic employees, but they're certainly a nice bonus.  Once I dip the chicken (and the fries, and the toast) into the Cane's sauce, any complaints of sogginess go out the window and all I want is more sauce. The fresh-squeezed lemonade and reasonable prices ($6.29 for three fingers, fries, toast, and a drink) are also appreciated.  Even though nothing really stands out as mind-blowingly good, I find myself addicted to this little fast food chain.",

It was my first time having Raising Cane's, and walking in reminded me for some reason a very clean and upscale Hardee's restaurant; maybe it's just me. The prices are pretty much the same when comparing the chicken strips to KFC's or even Popeye's Chicken. I do like the soda machine as it has the crunch ice that I like. We ordered 2 Caniac combos which came with 6 strips per combo, fries and toast in one, cole slaw and 2 toast in another. Down side is that they charge you for extra sauce. I can't truly rate the food though as we had it to go and brought it to our hotel. By the time we checked in and settled down, the food was so soggy. Only reason why I ate it was because I was really hungry. The chicken and the sauce had flavor, which really is all I can say for this review. I'll be visiting the location near me in Cali and actually eat it there and rate the food then.",

So that was our first stop when we got to town.  Abby and I split a Caniac combo. It came w/one drink, six strips, fries and two pieces of texas toast. The fries were fine, the toast was really good, and the chicken strips were AMAZING! Who needs the rest. It's like going out for hot wings - all you need are the strips. And they serve them w/this weird sauce that no one can explain. Jimmy couldn't tell me what it was, but much more telling, the women at the counter - including the manager - could tell me either. But it was quite good. Abby and I both liked it. I can't tell you what it is.  But what I can say is GO TO RAISING CANE'S! You won't regret it. I promise. And it's not like patronizing a chain because it's local - it only has a couple of locations. Oops! I just found it it is a chain. Sorry. But it's an exception. Like Texas Roadhouse and Carrabba's. So go. Now. I don't care what time it is.  Are you still waiting?  Am I just wasting my breath here?  Seriously, I don't need to hear myself talk ...

A friend of mine was raving about this place b4 our last trip so we had to make a point of trying it. On May 3rd on our way to the freeway to head back to L.A we stopped and BOY WE'RE WE GLAD WE DID. These were the best chicken fingers we have EVER had, so juicy and the fingers weren't just all crispy batter.The batter is thin so u just get this deliciously juicy tender. This place is so simple, they do 1 thing chicken fingers, just 2 sides, 2 sauces & Texas toast, huge chix strip sand comes with 3 strips. But it proves if u do 1 thing do it better than anyone else. And they will come, and we did & will continue. Oh the service was wonderful,we went through the drivethru, our receipt says Shelby, he was awesome. I understand we have our first one just opened here in Cali not to far from us, will have to try it out.",

Luckily, it was really close to the ATM stop that we needed to go to before reaching Vegas.   I ended up ordering the caniac combo. It came with 6 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, and a large drink. The chicken fingers were juicy and hot when I received it. I ended up making small chicken sandwiches. Pieces of bread with the chicken and some coleslaw was really tasty together.   Overall, good deal for a fast meal.",

It is a blessing and a curse that this particular location is in the same shopping center as my work. It is amazing to see how much this business has grown. I remember when there were only 2 locations and now there are 7! It is no surprise considering that the food is so good. The menu is so basic, but it packs a little punch. The selection is variable, but a basic combo contains chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, coleslaw, and dipping sauce.   The chicken is always cooked to perfection. (Except for during my last visit when it was overdone, but that was Black Friday and they were busy, so I guess I'll overlook that this time.) There is also a chicken sandwich available. It's just a sandwich with chicken tenders tucked inside.   The crinkle cut fries are a little bland, but a little ketchup can always help that. Their texas toast is freaking amazing! A little crispy around the edges, soft and buttery in the middle. I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, so whenever I order, I always replace my coleslaw with an extra slice of texas toast. And that is the beauty of this place! If you find that you don't like something, you can always replace it with something else!   The Cane's sauce is unlike any other dipping sauce I have ever tried. It kind of looks like thousand island, but the flavor is hard to explain. I have always loved it, but if you're not a fan, they have honey mustard available.   This particular location always has great customer service. I primarily use the drive thru and always chat it up with the cashiers. They are so nice and friendly. Give Cane's a try if you haven't already! They have grown for a reason!",

They apparently specialize in chicken fingers only. We are not fans of chicken fingers but our youngest daughter is. It tasted like real chicken.  It's tender, a little bit dry but flavorful. So, the final vote was a thumbs-up on the flavor. Prices were pretty decent, too.",

I think it was like 9:50pm.  Ugh.  Drove around the shopping area and saw a line full of cars in the drive-thru and was like \"what's that?\"  Never heard of it.  But I told my husband, if there's a line like that and a lobby full of people, it's gotta be good!  We take a chance and go in.  My daughter and I weren't really feeling \"chicken strips\" so we walked across the way to get a smoothie, but first, I asked my husband to order me and our daughter a kid's meals to share (mind you she is 18 and can eat!).  My husband ordered a meal.  We get back to our hotel room and OMG!!!  Those chicken fingers were to die for!  with the special sauce!!!  I was so upset that I got a smoothie and wished I got a meal too.  The closet Raising Cane's to us is Reno... we plan to take a trip to Reno in the near future, just to get some chicken fingers!",

They say the meat is never frozen and I don't know what that means, but the tenders come out nice and ummm tender.  The menu is pretty basic but still can be confusing (I don't know why).  Basically, they sell chicken tenders, fries, coleslaw, this great buttered lightly toasted thick bread.  And that's about it.  Oh yeah, and their own ranch style dipping sauce.  I think its good that they stick to one main thing only.  So, what you can order are combinations of the items above.  Nice hello greeting when you enter.  Friendly staff.  They keep the tables fairly clean when it's busy.  They seem to do great business whenever I'm there.  Two side notes: I hope they start opening these in the LA area.  And the bottled water - the bottled water, I don't know what it is, but it's like super cold and good.  Not like too cold it's close to frozen, but cold.  And good (or did I say that already?).",

    "text": "Texas Toast and Cane's Sauce. Really, that's all you need when you come to Cane's. Something about the buttery, crispy deliciousness of the Texas Toast with the creaminess to the ambiguous Cane's Sauce (similar to a Thousand Island dressing with far more pepper) - it's euphoria in your mouth.  As for the chicken fingers, they are definitely better than what they used to be. When Cane's first came to Vegas, the fingers were dry and the downfall of the place. However, they have most certainly improved - moist and perfectly fried. The fries are decent, just sub-par crinkle fries that I tend to not even order. The slaw is good, but nothing extraordinary.  Then there's the tea - a bit too sweet for my liking, but always consistently good.   But I'm telling you, the toast and the sauce. All you need really. If anything, get the chicken on the side.",

I went there last night ordered a the sandwich combo with no lettuce.  Easy right.  Nope.  Not only did it include lettuce. But they told just to take it off.  The manager was more interested in talking to some girl at the counter and the cashier was totally oblivious to the situation. Needless to say I rather drive to Utah and go to Zaxbys before I visit that place again.",

Never will I do that again.  The chicken is cooked to perfection, juicy, tender, crispy!  The fries are ok, it doesn't wow me, it just goes good with the fingers, but so does the toast! Buttery goodness.  And you gotta get an extra side of cane sauce, I dip everything in it. And the food too.  An then the sweet tea, oh the sweetie, oh the sweat tea, oh the sweaty... Free refills on them by the way.  It is True what they say; the toast is the most, the sauce is boss, chicken is kickin, the napkins whats hapnin, the straws the laws, the fries got size, and so on and so forth.",

I waited a few minutes and noticed that they served about 6 cars in the drive thru before asking where my order was. The guy told me it would be right out, then the next orders that came out were for others that ordered way after I did. I went up there again to see what the problem was, and the female drive thru person with the dirty black sweater, glasses and a headset said my order would be out in 4 seconds. I said yeah right, 4 seconds are up and it came out close to another 4 minutes later. I basically wasted 15 minutes of my life in this hell hole. The food wasn't all that either, more like Raising cr@p to me...",

This is the kind of place for a late night belly filler where you need to ignore your health.  This is likely also a good place for the weekend visitor from LA to stop by on their drive back.  It's just a few short minutes from the strip to the South and has a drive thru.  The chicken fingers are juicy, flavorful, and the \"Cane Sauce\" is uniquely sweet, tangy and practically drinkable.  I was tempted to order more, but one little tub was enough for 3 chicken fingers.  In addition to this, the fries are a bit on the soggy side, but the Texas toast is firm and slightly crunchy.  In fact, this is how I imagine Texas toast should be like.  Considering all the fat and oil in a simple 3-piece meal, I didn't feel it seeping out of my pores like some fast food makes me feel.  It wasn't a pick-me-up or anything, but it didn't put me to sleep right away either.  Worth a visit if you want something quick and yummy.  Still, make sure to go on a jog later and burn all those calories off!",

Very light on the batter and the chicken, not dry, and was not overcooked aka extra crunchy too! The dipping sauce is crack! Its like a mix of thousand island and bbq sauce.. HEAVEN! Texas toast: buttered on both sides and toasted to perfection!  The sweet tea is good by itself. Think of McDonalds but 10 times better! Our friend reccommend to buy the gallon. Which we did! Who would have thought? Buying a gallon worth of sweet tea at the drive thru. Yes, it comes in a gallon size container. Im glad we did cus it lasted the whole weekend!  I would make an effort to come to on of their locations in Vegas. It is worth trying. Plus sweet tea in the Vegas heat..is refreshing!!  Make a location in the Bay Area..please!!!!",

I ordered the 3 tender combo and by the time the food came out I had lost my appetite. I don't want to completely blame the employees as it was obvious sitting there that the WalMart-type customer base was a bunch of slobs that don't clear their tables when there's a line of people waiting for a table. Finally, I have to give some feedback on the food quality. Chicken was decent, fries and sides pretty good. What puzzled me was they only had one sauce - a ketchup mayo blend. Come on, you're a chicken place and should have 4-6 sauces to choose from. I won't be back and do not recommend this place until they can keep the dining experience out of the garbage.",

These are boneless chicken breast strips coated and fried crispy. Served with crinkle cut fries, coleslaw, honey toast and their signature sauce. The place is clean and the staff friendly & attentive. After you place your order you can help yourself to the self serve fountain drinks featuring my favorite sweet tea. When your order is ready they bring it to your table! So the next time you're in Vegas give this place a try!",

I love coming here when I go to Vegas and their chicken tenders are amazing and I should know because if you ask any of my friends what I majorly order at restaurants, it is chicken strips/tenders. Don't believe me? I order it at BJ's, Yardhouse, Red Robin, Cheesecake Factory, and even as an appetizer dish from Denny's, Ihop, and Boiling Crab and there's mooooore lol.   Besides that, if there was a Raising Cane's, I would probably go right now. Food is great, it's a fast food restaurant and the price is decent. Depending on location, it can be packed and the seating being limited. If any case, that would be my only thing about this location. There were lots of people standing up waiting for a seat because it was that popular. I do recommend putting the honey mustard and their special sauce together. I thought that tasted good. I definitely recommend coming here or just at least try it when you're leaving Vegas.",

He let me try a piece and I ended up stealing 2 pieces of his strips and  a bunch of his fries because they were crinkle cut fries! I love crinkle cut fries and I love their sauce!

The fries was pretty good when it was still hot, but did not taste that great once it cooled off.  The roll was grilled with butter and tasted fresh.  The chicken tenders was pretty big and I couldn't even finish it.  I had to take half of it home.   The sweet tea was pretty good.  Not too sweet and I like that the dispenser was self serve.

    "text": "How do they make the chicken here?  I always assumed it was magic because I have never had a bad chicken strip here. The consistency in the chicken is superb. It's always very moist. The menu is basically Chicken strips, more chicken strips, and a chicken strip burger. You won't find variety here unfortunately. The Texas Toast that they have here is also very good and very popular. It's a big, fat, soft, buttered piece of toast they provide with every meal (except the kids meal, and the burger, I believe). The french fries are nothing too special and the coleslaw is decent, although I always tend to substitute it for an extra piece of toast at no extra charge! I believe the sweet tea and lemonade is made in-house and very good. I don't remember the last time I haven't had the sweet tea here.  With this location in particular, you may find it VERY packed if you come at the wrong time. I believe since it's closest to the strip, and a lot of tourists have heard about this place. You might be waiting a while and scouting for a table. They have a drive through, but you might be waiting a bit as well if the line gets pretty long.  Prices are fairly reasonable, ranging from $7-$10 depending on how many chicken strips you want and how big the drink is with the combo.  I would stop and try this if you haven't been to a Canes before. This is a big favorite for locals here in Las Vegas. Everybody that I bring here for their first time ends up being addicted and finds themselves back here sooner than later!",

The food is good, the chicken could use more flavour but that's what the 'secret' sauce is for. 9/10 times the fries are good. Sometimes they aren't salted enough and taste like straight potato. But there are salt packets so it's not big deal. And in my opinion the price is very fair. For a little more than $7 you can get the Box Combo. I'd recommend subbing the coleslaw out (which is decent) for a second texas toast or more fries, extra finger, etc...  They are constantly cleaning the restaurant which I like very much since I am a clean freak, even though my room looks like a pigsty. The tables are usually cleaned within minutes after the previous customer has left, and they are constantly sweeping the floors and wiping the windows. My only gripe is sometimes the booth seats are forgotten and will sometimes have food on them.   It does get very crowded on the weekend, but that is to be expected since it is near the outlet mall and Town Square.",

Hold up....let me circle back for just a moment. Did I tell you home much I love the Cane's sauce? I dip EVERYTHING in it (including my fingers!).

I've been here a couple of times after the first time and my usual order is now the Combo Box (which I share with my husband) - comes with four pieces of chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, texas toast, one Cane's Sauce, and a regular drink priced around $7!  The combination of chicken, slaw, fries, and toast together satisfies me in all ways; the texas toast is by far the best toast I have ever had, really! The outer part of the bread is golden and crispy, but once you pass that outer layer, the middle part of the bread is so soft and just literally melts in your mouth. Love it!",

The side was good and I had the sweet tea which was delicious as well. I'll be back. Great deal and value for the money.",

It had 6 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, 2 Cane's sauce, Texas toast, and large drink.  The service wasn't as fast as expected probably because THE FOOD WAS HOT AND FRESH when it was served (2nd STAR). The drive-thru SERVER WAS REALLY FRIENDLY AND ATTENTIVE (3rd STAR). The chicken fingers were JUICY, TENDER, AND TASTY (4th STAR). Their sauce tasted like bbq sauce but we a tiny different kick to it that makes it uniquely delicious.  COLESLAW AND TOAST AREN'T USUALLY INCLUDED IN A CHICKEN FINGERS/STRIPS MEAL but they do at Cane's (5th STAR).   DEFINITELY A MUST-GO-TO RESTAURANT WHENEVER I VISIT LAS VEGAS!!",

Everyone working their seems to enjoy their job, which to me means they are either paid well or treated well. Which is always something I like to support. My first time there I ordered the 3 strip meal and they have me 4 because they felt they were small strips. I thought it was a nice gester, I didn't even see the strips and they just gave me a 4th one. Them taking care of the customer before the customer can even have an issue is a major plus. The food is amazing and that bread, my gosh it's good. Their special sauce is pretty good as well. Definitely going to take visiters here. Yum",

It has the perfect amount of breading. The texas toast is delicious.  Ask for \"double buttered\" for them to butter both sides. The fries are good.  Not crispy, but not limp either.  Its cooked perfectly. What it really comes down to is the sauce.  Its like thousand island but its got a kick to it.  I usually substitute my slaw for extra sauce when I get the combo so I have plenty for my chicken as well as for my fries.",

You can tell it actually came from a chicken breast! The menu here at Cane's is simple, you want chicken fingers with fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, or as a sandwich? Why complicate things? At least everything on the menu is good even the drinks! I love their sweet tea, and also their fresh squeezed lemonade, made fresh from real lemons everyday, (which by the way is not refillable and cost a few quarters more). Their secret ranch/ketchup/pepper dipping sauce is pretty bomb too, and if you want extra it's .50c more too, but hey am not complaining coz I LOVE their food! Also if you read up on their history it's pretty interesting too. So definitely try this place out if you haven't yet you are definitely missing out.",

So me and my own roommate played with. :)  The decor is oh entertainers of past with vegas flair and a cute pooch for what the name of the restaurant came from. Chicken. Bread and special sauce.  Infact the sauce alone.. Is so good. A little tangy, a little bb-q-ish. A little piece of heaven. So good that when canes comes to the work place everyone jumps on it. Well.. anything is better then employee food. But this is the holy grail. ANd if no chicken is left the sauce will go on anything, including the pb&j that is smashed in. :)",

IF you can find it! at least i know where to go when i dont feel like hunting down the cans. last month at work they were giving away coupons for a free strip meal so i hope more ppl find out about this place. theres the one on charleston and decatur in front of walmart and lowe and thats the closest to me but i dont feel like looking up the address bla bla bla..  $6.13 for the #2 combo.. better than paying that at kfc for a strip meal and not even having a drink.. plus their canes sauce is better than any ranch, honey mustard, or bbq that any place can offer. zesty..creamy.. and oh so yummy..  oh! and if you get the other combos that come with fried and coleslaw you can get a double side of fries or slaw.. or another piece of texas toast..

So, this trip we decided we needed a carb fix and checked out the reviews on Yelp...and decided that this was the place we needed to finally visit.  Well the trip was worth it!  There are basically 4 selections to choose from and they range from a plate with 3 chicken fingers to 6...or a sandwich.  Fries and a drink included for a very reasonable price.  The chicken fingers are like nothing we have tried before...lightly breaded, deep fried, tasty and not greasy at all.  In fact after ordering \"The Box\" (4 chicken fingers, coleslaw, fries and a drink)...I really only needed one napkin.  My wife thought the chicken fingers were great but commented that the crinkle cut fries were more like the frozen fries you buy in a bag at the grocery store.  I have to agree...they were nothing special.  The much raved about dipping sauce was also very good.  A slight zing and mild black pepper taste added to the wonderful flavor of the chicken fingers.  The coleslaw was also tasty.  The restaurant was clean with ample seating...and the staff very friendly.  When we finally headed out the door a friendly staffer said to us, \"Bye and have a great day\".  How often does that happen these days.  The chicken fingers I rate a 5...but the fries lower my overall rating down to a 4.  Great place to go when you need a quick carb fix!  We will be back!",

What to order: If you're petite, go for the 3 Finger Combo and add an extra Texas Toast. The combo comes with 3 chicken fingers, crinkle fries, Texas Toast, Cane sauce and a drink.  For you man-eaters, get the CANIAC: 6 Chicken Fingers, Extra Crinkle fries, Coleslaw, 2 Cane sauces, Texas Toast and a drink.  I don't understand why this place hasn't made it to California. Cane's will give Chick-fil-A a run for its money. Definitely the chicken fingers at Cane's are better, especially with the sauce.",

It sure beats eating that crap at KFC!   Heres the breakdown...  Chicken fingers: thumbs waaaaaaay up.  The chicken was moist and tender.  There was just enough coating and just enough crispy-ness to the outside.  I can eat 10 of them just by myself!! The special dipping sauce makes these fingers unbelievable.   Texas toast: thumbs up!  Crispy and buttery outside.. soft and fluffy on the inside.  You can taste the artery clogging butter on the toast! YUMMM  Sweet tea: mind blowingly good.  So good that we had to grab a jug of the ish to go.  My bf wants to stop by Cane's on our next vegas trip and get jugs of the tea to mix with our booze!  Fries:  good but i've had better.  Verdict?  The chicken is damn tasty.  It may seem pricey but its a lot better than going to the strip and having dinner somewhere.

BUT if you think that's a bad thing then you've never been there. It's simple, good, inexpensive food in Vegas. We loved that it was piping hot, fast and served with a smile. No need to study the menu... Want 2, 3, 4 or 6 pieces? Want coleslaw or not? Thats about all the decisions you need to make. We liked it and will probably have more before leaving Sin City.",

I had always driven past it but chalked it up as another chain.  That's not the case, she said.  It's home to childhood memories of greasy eating and awesome chicken fingers.  She was completely right!  Though I definitely don't need another one, thanks for another grease pit to enjoy!  In-n-Out just might have some competition now.  Once i get off the plane, it's not so simple anymore; do i want chicken fingers or animal style fries?  It's so close to my parents' house that I have yet another option for food once the gambling hunger kicks in after a night at the tables.  The menu is simple: chicken fingers, and more chicken fingers.  I was baffled at how tender they can get the chicken.  I feel like i'm almost eating healthy! (operative word: almost)  The cane's sauce which I was specifically briefed on, was awesome.  What's their secret?  You could dip anything in that sauce, and I did.  The texas toast, fries, and chicken fingers all taste like little pieces of heaven when dipped in said sauce.  THE SAUCE!!!  The only problem?  Too many high schoolers.  Since it's next to a 24-hr smoothie cafe, this place is swimming with teenyboppers up to no good at night.  I felt like I was at the Peach Pit After Dark and Kelly and Donna were sitting next to us.  Or it felt like the Max, where Kelly, Jessie and Lisa were singing I'm So Excited as the group, Hot Sundae.  I could go on and on, but i'll stop myself.",

    "text": "On a recent Vegas trip with my friends, we all got to select an activity that everyone must go to or do.  Mine was to go to Raising Cane's because I like chicken fingers and the last time I had them was over a year ago.    This Raising Cane's is located at the Las Vegas Outlets, so you can only imagine how crowded and busy it can be.  And if you think the one on Flamingo is a better bet, think again, it's just as crowded. We came during the lunch rush, it was also Labor Day too.  They also happened to have an event going on, a race car driver was there and they had a giveaway for a ride in his car.  I shared with my boyfriend, we ordered the Caniac which is 6 chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, fries, and a drink. Just as I remember it, tender and juicy.  As some may have said before, be careful on the first bite, these things are HOT, not spicy but temperature.  I think they cook the chicken to order.  I really like the sauce, it's peppery with the right amount of tangy-ness.  I think that's the whole reason I go!  If you haven't tried the sauce you should, because I didn't at first and didn't like the chicken, but the combo with together it tastes amazing!  The fries are standard, tastes like the Ore-ida brand.  If you like sweet tea, the sweet tea is good, especially with during the hot Vegas weather.  I like that they service the drink with crushed ice, I like it better than the cubes.  Personally, I don't like the toast, I feel it needs something else.  Maybe next time, I'll spend the sauce on it to see how it tastes, maybe that's what it needs.  Enough of this fatass talk...  The service is good, everyone there is so nice.  You get greeted when you enter and when you leave.  I can't wait for my next Vegas trip, because Vegas locations are the closest locations to CA!",

I ordered the Caniac combo which comes with 6 strips. The cole slaw is just ok. Fries are good. Texas toast is buttery and large. But the stars of the show are definitely those hot, crispy strips!  Place was clean and service was very friendly. I ate at a location in Dallas last year with my brother and was equally impressed there as well. Seems like a good franchise.",

    "text": "EVERY TIME I'M IN VEGAS - I'VE GOT TO GO TO RAISING CANE'S!! and the question I leave with...  \"why isn't there one in the bay area?!\"  Brief Summary - Fast Food - Limited Menu, but good at what they do - ONLY Chicken Fingers - get the CANIAC meal - why isn't there one in the bay, dammit?!  OK so first off, I was born and raised on fried chicken. All my Filipino family loves fried chicken. My favorite is Popeye's because that's what we have out here in the Bay. NOW if there was a Raising Cane's in my area, I'd be there!   They ONLY make Chicken Fingers. Which is basically a smaller chicken strip. They're super juicy, fried and crispy. And you dip them in the special CANE sauce. I don't  know what it is about the Cane's sauce, but it's really good. I'm usually a bbq or ranch fan but man give me some Cane's special sauce and I'm good to go.  I like their simply wavy cut looking fries. They're NOT cris-cut frieds but they're pretty simple and I like that they're simple. Not overly salty and not overly crispy.  I love the TEXAS TOAST. My family is a big fan of carbs especially bread and rice. So the texas toast is somewhat similar to Sizzler's garlic cheese toast minus the garlic and cheese. I don't know it's nothing super special but it's tasty.  I usually get the coleslaw too with my meal. I've always loved coleslaw, and I wouldn't rate Cane's coleslaw as the best, I say it's decent and it tastes good. With all the food in my Caniac meal, it's a good contrast to the fried and toasted.  What do I drown it all down with? oh yes, SWEET TEA. I love tea, especially sweet tea. Which is why cane's is so great. It's simple and it's to the point. It doesn't cost an arm and a leg but you get so much food. Caniac is like 8 bucks.  For those picky and people with their noses up *ahem*, expect a simple and tasty meal. If you want a whole bunch of selection go somewhere else. I don't know why people always try to expect a lot out of a simple place like Cane's. They're good at what they do and they stick to it! Why not be good at one thing instead of being mediocre at a whole bunch of things?!  I love Cane's and hope they open one out here in the Bay Area. It would make a killing where I live. I've been to this location and another and I loved this one just a tad bit more. The people were super friendly and it was pretty busy but they keep everything going and get tables cleaned pretty quickly.",

But the meal that we probably enjoyed the most (and was by far the least expensive!) was the quickie breakfast of chicken fingers and crinkle cut fries at 9am at Raising Cane's.  Chicken fingers and fries at 9am in the morning you ask?  HELL YEA!  You know that something was really good when you eat it and 3 hours later while driving down the freeway, you keep on thinking about how good it was!  Why don't we have chicken fingers like these in California?!!",

My cousins had told me that this place was really good, but I wasn't too hyped about it just because I was afraid of disappointment. Nope, this place was so good. The chicken tenders were great in size, not too big and not small. It was crispy and super moist . Yum.Three pieces filled me up with their crispy wavy fries and their super soft Texas toast. Wow. I can't even express how delicious this meal was. Their sauce was the Bomb, and they even had Louisiana hot sauce which made it seem so authentic to me!   The portion was super big, the party of 6 that I came with ordered 3 6 piece chicken tenders with fries and 2 Texas toast. We didn't finish, leaving one piece of chicken tender each and lots of fries.   After being amazed from this place, as I walk out the door the employees all said goodbye. How sweet!    Please bring this to San Jose California!!!!",

And definitely the best I've ever had from a fast food joint. Every strip is fresh and prepared after they're ordered. They're super crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle but the best thing is there is zero grease on these strips. The fries were also nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The toast, slaw and sauce were all amazing too. Oh, and their sweet tea is perfect. Not overly sweet. Perfect.   Prices are dirt cheap and service is fast and friendly.   Majors thanks to Dru \"DirtySmoke <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dirtysmokebbq.com%2F%26%2334&s=9ddc62367c9fa9f1a96075a18e77d74927fea6df6931cf66408aa5da88d06055\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dirtysmokebbq.com/&#34</a>; C. for putting this place on my radar. You're right, Dru, it was amazing.  Check out Raising Cane's for yourself next time you're in Vegas. Trust me, it's worth leaving the strip for.",

Sauce is like a remoulade - tastes like my daughter's sauce she makes mixing ketchup, mayo and garlc powder,paprika and other spices. (sauce great with sweet potato fries btw). Staff friendly.  Just eta: One of our player's cars was broken into and all his luggage, etc taken.

Right by the premium outlets, so it's easy to locate.  We stopped by, nobody was inside, lots of seating, and everything looked clean.  We ordered the 6 piece with crinkle fries, a texas buttered toast, coleslaw and a huge drink all for under $10.00! The chicken was freshly fried (was worried since nobody else was in there)  The chicken strips were nice and hot, huge strips.  Good batter, the sauce had a tang and accompanied the chicken very well.  Fries were nothing special.  The toast, oh my the toast was so good!!  It was soft and buttery, but just enough crunch on the outside!  We should have asked to trade the coleslaw for another piece of toast so I didn't have to share!!  Overall, I see what the hype is about!  A chain that only specializes in Chicken Fingers, that means it's gotta be good to only sell one thing! it's good!  If you're looking for a late night tummy filler for cheap, come here! The combo is good enough to share between 2!  Next time I want to try the lemonade after reading all the reviews.  I opted for sweet tea which was pretty good!",

When I tried to claim my very generous prize  I was told \"you must claim the prize on a future visit\"  I said \"this is my future visit\" as I won the wonderful prize on a previous visit to the establishment. They did not believe me as they had given a soda cup to me before delivering the food and they assumed I was trying to cheat them for an extra chicken finger and was told again that they would not honor the winning coupon. Finally, someone of higher authority did bring a single chicken finger in a box to my table without saying a word. I really did not care about the extra chicken finger it is just the principal of offering a prize and not being willing to give the prize to the prize winner. I read all the fine print on the winning prize coupons and could not find where is says \"you must claim on a future visit\". Fortunatley for me while I was eating my food with my family we did win more food prizes. Unfortunatley for Cane's I will not be returning ever again to claim them and have been in the past a regular customer of their establisment. I assume they just want the tourist business who will not come back on a future visit to claim their prize. This way they can save money by finding a way to not give the contest prizes.",

When first trying Cane's I was a little skeptical of the fact they didn't have anything else on the menu except fingers and fries and the fact they didn't have ranch dipping sauce. However after trying their signature Caniac meal I knew why they only had one thing on the menu, because you wouldn't want to order anything else anyway! The Caniac comes with 6 chicken fingers, french fries, grilled texas toast bread, and Cane's special sauce. The Cane's sauce is hands down the best dipping sauce I have ever had and the Caniac is more than enough to fill me up and I can eat! If you are in Vegas and are having chick-fil-a withdrawals, unfortunately Vegas has yet to embrace the king of chicken, Raising Cane's is a quite capable replacement and you might head home wishing that there was a raising Cane's in your hometown instead!",

I was around the outlets last night waiting for one of my gal pals to get off work, hunger started to strike and I wanted to grub on a budget. I decided to scamper on in to Cane's to see what all the fuss was about. The place was very clean, staff was friendly when i told them i was a first timer, they gave me a rundown of the menu. I ordered the 3 piece meal, which came with 3 strips crinkle fries, texas toast and a drink. The strips were perfect, no nasty greasy crap or uber salty batter. The staff is on top of their game with keeping the place clean, so bonus points for the supervisor. The sauce was pretty damn scrumptious, texas toast was good fries were nice and yummy. Wish they would do a Roscoe's type deal with strips and waffles. I would like to give a shoutout/thank you to my Yelp pal Stephanie E. for the recomendation. :D",

    "text": "I LOVE CHICKEN FINGERS! I could probably eat them every day of the week! But sadly, that dream is not going to be reality anytime soon!  Reading some of my other Vegas Yelp friend's reviews, I bookmarked this place in hopes I could talk Minh into going before we hit up the outlets, which by the way is in the same area as this place!  Don't look for anything fancy here; it's just a good ol' drive thru fast food joint. Except when you walk in ::drum roll:: its clean smelling and clean looking! All the employees are actually happy to be working and even greet you!   Since we were having a late lunch, we decided to share a meal and went with ordering:  The Box Combo: Four Chicken Fingers  Fries  Coleslaw  Cane's Sauce  Texas Toast  Regular Drink  There is plenty of seating inside, we found a booth but wasn't 100% clean. Maybe we sat down too quick. An employee was walking by so I asked him if he would not mind cleaning out table. Instead of the rude yeah okay. He was nice about it and even said sorry that the tabletop was not totally clean.   Our number was called and Minh went to go get our food. When he got back to the table, the box was huge. The smell was inviting and the taste was the best! The chicken tenders were lightly seasoned and juicy! I had a bite of the coleslaw and that was pretty darn good too! Texas toast was out of this world yummi (I paid dearly for it over the next couple of days since I cannot really eat bread anymore) but it was worth it! Light and buttery this toast was thick!  The Cain sauce had an interesting taste; it was a unique and went well with the fries (which were not oily) and the chicken strips!  Raising Cane's was built from a dream one guy had. When others turned him down for loan he didn't give up instead he hustled and built his dream on his own. Todd Graves story is amazing along with his dog who the business is named after!   I'm hoping that they will bring this urber rad fast food joint to sunny California soon, otherwise this will be on my list of must have again before we go shopping!!!",

A table usually opens up every few minutes. Just order at the counter and wait till they call you up!  To be honest the chicken fingers and fries aren't spectacular nothing really taste worthy. But their texas toast is what makes up for it. When that warm crunchy bread hits your lips and you take a bite out of it, you'll just know...that this is not game. I don't know how to describe the flavor but it's just so damn good! I also love love love getting their iced tea! It's always on point and if you have a sweet tooth this is the perfect drink to go with your hot meal ^^.  Pro tip! You can substitute any of the items in your order for another item! I usually exchange the coleslaw for another toast :)  If I could change anything about this place it'd be the prices for their cane sauce. They  charge so much for such a small sauce -__-",

Don't get me wrong, it was decent, but from what I've heard about the place, it didn't match its hype. Tenders were small and flavorless without the dipping sauce and the fries had nothing to them. Had to add salt, and I hate adding salt! Last, when they give you your drink cup, they fill it almost full with ice before you go to the self service station to choose your drink. I'm thinking, OK, the ice isn't at the drink station...but it is! So why are you giving me ice upfront? In hopes that I won't overload on soda? I ended up dumping more than half of it out because I hate a lot of ice in my soda!   Will I come back? Maybe. But I won't go out of my way to eat here. Only if in the area and with someone who was seriously jonesing for it.",

I'm only giving it 3 stars for the following reason... when I was ordering, I asked the waitress to tell me about the secret sauce. I'm picky about my sauces. I prefer ranch and honey mustard so I was just asking her about it. Her response was well it's a secret sauce so I can't tell you what's in it. I didn't ask what's in it. I wanted to know is it spicy, mild, creamy? That pissed me off so I was in a bad mood by the time I got my food. I don't appreciate getting attitude from a 17 year old kid. It was my first time there. I was just asking a question. My food was good, but the girl at the counter ruined the moment for me with her attitude.

Obviously freshly battered and fried which makes a huge difference in the overall quality of the product.  Moist, tender, crispy, and simply seasoned.  The Canes sauce goes heavy on the cracked pepper, which I didn't mind at all.  The fries will crinkle cut fries which I think are fitting to the type of meal that is being served.  The coleslaw was pretty standard and on the sweet side.  The toast well...... I mean who doesn't love a warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside thick piece of white bread with butter slathered on one side? YUM!  OVERALL:  Pretty good place for what it is.  You don't find places that focus on chicken fingers so it's a great alternative for those who aren't so much into the 93457203975209384 burger joints in this country.

I'd take this shop's chicken over KFC any day. Chicken fingers were moist inside and batter was light and crispy, not greasy or dry like other chicken fast food places. For a family of three, we ordered the combo with 6 pieces of chicken and the chicken sandwich to share. Ordering and picking up happened in a reasonable time frame even though the restaurant was pretty busy. If I ever see another Raising Cane's, I'd be willing to check it out!",

The menu is clear and easy to read, and the staff always has a clever way of asking for your order; how fun is that! There's never a long wait even though there looks like there's a line of cars. They're super quick and efficient!   My husband and I share the Caniac Combo. Instead of cole slaw we ask for an extra piece of toast. It comes with enough chicken fingers and fries to fill us up!  We also get a couple extra sides of their signature sauces because it's so good I could eat it on literally anything!",

Did you know you could get double bread instead of fries!",

The chicken fingers are the best, hands down. (My in-laws are big fans of Popeyes, but that chain uses too much breading and there is a lot less flavor to them too; we had it for the Superbowl game, recently). The chicken here is tender, flavorful, and the breading is minimal. We usually get the caniac combo (fries, texas toast, coleslaw) along with two other fingers, to split. Our son is in heaven because this is his favorite meal ever. I love the sauce, it's not ranch, but it's got a really good flavor to it. I really like the coleslaw and I usually don't like the store-bought variety.    Most of the chains are the same: drive-through and counter service (both are busy), busy occupied tables, order at the counter, when your order is ready, your name is called. The drink machine is closeby (also where the napkins, etc. is located). The bathrooms are usually in the back or end of the restaurant. Everyone working here is usually nice. And empty tables are promptly cleaned too. I've never had a bad meal here, pretty dependable.",

And with my friend from Idaho having never been to Cane's and BADLY wanting to try it, you knew we had to send it!  Not too hungry on this particular day, so I kept it simple with the Box Combo instead of the Caniac Combo that I usually get. Quality was what I would expect from a typical Cane's location. Definitely have to get extra Cane's sauce! And I found out you can special order your friends to be extra crispy. Trust me it's worth it, because they have to make your fries extra fresh!  Service is excellent here, no complaints from me. And since there are so many Cane's locations in Vegas, it wasn't too packed. This would NEVER happen in SoCal. To be fair, we did actively avoid the Cane's location that was closest to the Strip. That decision paid off in spades!  Parking is incredible easy here. Thank god for that.  Bottom line, if I were on the Strip and wanted to hit up Cane's, this is the location I'd go to. Zero desire to try the location on Tropicana, I can imagine how much of a mess that location is.",

Chicken is moist, batter crispy, but flavor a little lacking. Generous portions. Not really my choice of food but could be yummy if you are in a rush and needing something quick and easy. Definitely a better choice than Mc Donald's chicken nuggets.. But still fast food. Yum for what it is.",

The meal is simple with the chicken, fries, coleslaw, texas toast, and fancy sauce. I actually like their sweet tea too. I'm not big on sweetened tea. But this is pretty southern authentic ;)",

Going to a place that makes it whole menu revolve around this one item, I was expecting some pretty darn good fingers that had some flavor, spice, kick, something to them.  Fries were pretty mediocre too.  The chicken fingers I got the other night at Jack in the Box were ten times more flavorful than these, not to mention cheaper.",

The sauce for dipping in is tasty but if you don't like sauce (dressing) or the extra calories, your chicken isn't going to be very tasty (no spices involved).  The fries were soggy, the cole slaw was warm, and the \"texas toast\" is just a hot dog bun that's grilled on one side.  Big fail, and very pricey for fast food.  The whole experience gave me a kinda \"drenched in grease\" feeling, not good.  Paula Deen would probably enjoy it though.",

I'm a big fan of chicken fingers however I usually end up really sick after eating them because most of the time chicken fingers are very greasy and have a really bad after taste, so needless to say, it's been pretty long since I've had chicken fingers. Let me just say that I've not burped up any funky tastes after eating here, or burped peroid for that matter. I was very impressed by the fact that the outside was crunchy and the inside was juicy and moist and it was cooked perfectly! The sauce is ok however I don't like mayo based sauces and I like my fingers plain with bbq sauce or louisiana hot sauce. The fries were good but I will say that I have had better fries at other places. The texas toast was a great compliment to the fingers, grilled but soft and not slathed in oil or butter. I didn't eat the cole slaw because well I just don't like cole slaw. LOL. Overall, I think it's a good value for the amount of food you get, the menu is no-fuss, kinda reminds me of In-N-Out Burger with long drive-thru lines, a small menu and friendly workers.",

The chicken fingers and fries are great, but what really makes the experience amazing is the Cane's sauce. It is so good I almost want to dip everything I eat in it for the rest of my life. The sweet tea is consistently amazing, something I appreciate because places like Lucille's and Memphis BBQ struggle to keep their sweet tea consistent.  This place is definitely worth giving a try, and if you're a sauce person, ordering an extra side of Cane's sauce will probably be necessary.",

Mediocre coleslaw and fries comes with The Box Combo as well - but the rest of the food more than makes up for it and you didn't really go to Raising Cane's for their coleslaw and fries did you?.  Cane's sauce is what makes this though. Whatever can be dumped in Cane's sauce, should be.  It is like CRACK.  Got you wanting more and more.  Ask for (2) sauces if you're doing The Box Combo.  Believe me, you will need it.  If you're that hungry, however, order the Carniac, which comes with (6) fingers ((as opposed to just 4 in The Box Combo)) and 2 sauces.  If you dare, also get another piece of Texas Toast.  Really it is that good.  So good I came here twice in my 4 day Vegas trip!",

After leaving Town Square, grandma, Lil sis, and I did some shopping and were trying to figure out what to eat for dinner. Grandma said \"What about Cane's?\" And I said, Hell Yeah. From there, we were driving on South bound Las Vegas Blvd toward the Las Vegas Outlet. As we approached Cane's, the drive thru was long, therefore, we decided we were gonna go in. We ordered a tail gate of 25 pieces of chicken for $23 plus 8 personal sized containers of the Cane's sauce, a pan of fries for $7.59, some individual coleslaws that were a dollar something, and three large lemonades. The total was about $44. The food was once again scrumptious and was washed down by the lemonade. It was um um um good.",

They cater for parties in larger portions all the way up to 100 finger tailgates I believe. You pay roughly $1 a chicken finger and the Texas toast is a epic good side to choose.

The employees show nothing but courtesy welcomes and a good experience.   Food Quality/Quantity: The quality of this food has been more than perfect every time. I have never had any disappointing feelings towards the food quality at this location. Everything comes out hot and ready to eat. The quantity is more than enough.

    "text": "\"Hey! \"Don't listen to a word I say \"Hey! \"The screams all sound the same \"Hey!\"  \"Though the truth may vary \"this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore\"  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  It is a chain and the same food is offered here as everywhere else the company operates. We're not here to discuss the food ...  Although, I must mention that the coleslaw is close to inedible. You may think the truth may vary on this account; however, you will be finding that you are sorely mistaken. Coleslaw's nasty.  What are we here to talk about then if not the food?   -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Service The service at this Raising Cane's is exceptional for a fast food chain. They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out for friendliest service in this category. They have employees cleaning other patrons' messes (more on that later), bringing patrons their food, retrieving patrons' finished trays, et al. They are truly best in show (ahem, pun intended) when it comes to service to customer. Which leads to ...  Customers I have never met a bigger group of obnoxiously loud, rude, messy people. Not in an elementary school cafeteria will one run into such mayhem. They leave enormous messes on tables, under tables, on seats, under seats, et al. They are the loudest day and night, weekday and weekend.   The first time I patronised this location, I imagined it was because teens from a nearby school come here to act like idiots. \"Damn, these kids really need to get the fuck out of here\" is what I thought. It was not the kids.   It is epidemic. It does not matter what time of day I visit. This location consistently has a cockfighting ring aspect to the ambiance in terms of noise and messiness. The employees are running around trying to clean all the preposterous messes left behind; however, it is a losing battle.   This location is a lost cause.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------  I don't expect enough peace and quiet to be able to meditate at any fast food establishment. But, I also don't patronise a restaurant -- fast-food or otherwise -- to acquire a rare headache or feel the urge to stuff tissue in my ears so that the decibel levels can be mitigated.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Pro Tip: Is it necessary to scream at the top of your lungs when your food buddy is sitting right next to you? Shut the fuck up ....  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Rating: Three-stars, \"A-OK.\" (Start throwing some of these yokels out.)  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Postscript. First hand experiences ... first hand experiences ... I have to slip in more first hand experience accounts for the flaggers. I have walked through the front door of this Raising Cane's during business hours. I have ordered from the counter. I have sat down and eaten my food. (Check the check-ins, fool.)",

Their fries are even good and I don't like wavy fries. Oh! And the bread is so good. It is buttery and topped with sesame seeds. This is my go to place for chicken fingers. I have also noticed the staff are always friendly and polite. They welcome you as you walk in the door and always start up a conversation. The three finger box is enough for one person easily and you're only spending about $7.   Note: The hand made lemonade is delicious as well but no refills and is more expensive then a regular fountain drink.",

If you have never been to Raising Canes and you are a human that enjoys things that are fried, you are missing out!!!! Their chicken fingers are like no other with their perfect, slightly heavy breading, which I very much love. The flavor is spot on.  Most people dip their chicken in that addictive sauce, but I dip everything that I have in the sauce. Fries, toast, my fork. It's peppery and so flippin good! I could do shots of that sauce.  I've never had any issues with their service and on the few occasions they left something off, they always bring it right out with no questions.  If you drive by and see 120 cars in the drive thru, just know that it's worth it. Love this place.  Did I mention you can eat a good size meal for under $10? WIN!",

We arrived during the peak lunch hours and the place was packed.

I was really impressed by the good customer service and teamwork I witnessed at this location.   We got our meals quickly and happily ate our chicken fingers while we chatted. I'm still not a huge fan of the food, but I do like the sauce and Texas toast they serve with it.   The manager even came by while we ate to check on us and make sure everything was ok.",

It is to die for. Peppery and creamy goodness.   I ordered the Caniac combo with 20 extra sides of sauces to take home. I know you can order like a 32 oz cup of it but I thought it would be easier in the little 2 oz cups.   It tasted good. Not as good as I remember but maybe my taste buds changed or I was expecting too much?  I used to get random dreams about Canes back home! I had to come! Will definitely be back",

This location was pretty busy since it was near the outlets so it was a struggle to try to find parking, but finally got in, the service was pretty fast. The menu had some pretty good combo deals I went with chicken strips, fries, and toast deal and it was pretty good. The chicken strip was flavorful, the fries weren't too salty, the bread was my favorite part of the meal, yummy! Also the canes sauce really is crack, make sure to put it on everything, yum!  Overall, for a fast food joint, this place isn't too shabby; for a quick tasty bite in Vegas, id be back here for some chicken strips and toast :)   Happy eats, loves! ^_^",

All of the chicken strips are fried but you can get them \"naked\" or without batter. The chicken and fries were good. Crispy on the outside and fifth and moist on the inside. The roll on the sandwich was very thick, too thick in my opinion. The special sauce was also very tasty but very thick. Coleslaw was very tasty but the Texas toast was soggy and too salty. The sweet tea is sweetened with sugar cane and good (also very similar to mcdonalds sweet tea). Good for a quick bite but not something I can eat everyday.",

However, I can't give more than 3 stars.  You would think that a place that specializes only in chicken fingers and boasts that they are never frozen would really blow you away. But Raising Cane's just doesn't do that for me.  The menu is simple, which is great.  I usually get the most popular meal \"The Box,\" which comes with 4 chicken fingers, fries, cole slaw, texas toast and their special dipping sauce (which is the best part of the meal, IMO).  I like my chicken fingers to have a crisp coating, and these just fall short.  They were almost soggy, and I just wasn't impressed (I've eaten here before and I don't remember having any complaints, so maybe their quality has just gone down over the last couple years).  The fries are nothing spectacular.  They are crinkle cut, and I think I've had better from Ore-Ida.  I find the cole slaw to be tasteless. Same goes for the texas toast.  Yes, it is toasty, but I just don't think it had a lot of flavor.  The dipping sauce and sweet tea are really the only things that save this meal for me.  If I could bottle that sauce, I would.  Also, the sweet tea is refreshing and delicious.  Although, I figure it's pretty hard to screw up sweet tea.  I also think that they are a bit overpriced.  I was there a couple of days ago and 2 meals cost $16.  That's just crazy!  I will keep them at 3 stars because of the service.",

That Cane's sauce is to die for and I love using it with your chicken, Texas toast, and fries. You can't even beat their prices at all. They give you about four chicken tenders, fries, Texas toast and a drink for about $7. That is a pretty amazing deal to me!",

RC's is a good place for a fast chicken finger meal.  The chicken is tasty and crunchy, the toast is good, and the lemonade is refreshing-not too sweet and no funky aftertaste like Minute Maid.  I like the sauce.  I think they have sweet tea too.  I'd get this for a quick lunch on my lunch break.",

Here's why: -There was a line but it moved quick. -Orders came out speedy quick as well. -Toast-- Yum for bread lovers. The slight sweetness of it really offsets everything else. -Chicken-- Pretty damn good for chicken fingers! Lightly battered, crispy, and moist. Made the fries an \"ehh\" for me. And I love me some fries. Oh and I almost forgot about the coleslaw. Cuz it really didn't need to be there for me. -And it doesn't even burn a hole in your wallet. Definitely a revisit whenever I'm in the area.",

Call me a health snob but I don't like to eat meat I don't recognize, and chicken fingers would rank #1 in this department.  My fiance is much less picky with fast food philosophies, and since Raising Cane's is so well-loved with Yelpers, I was convinced to give it a try, at the potential risk of sinking my teeth into Mystery Meat masqueraded as Chicken Fingers.  Well, the reward for my bravery was quite satisfying.  The chicken fingers tasted clearly to be good-quality chicken meat (more like pulled chicken, not minced chicken), moist, tender and flavorful.  The batter was also among the best, crispy without being too greasy.  The sauce is so delicious that I'd like to make this offer: if any Yelper knows the recipe to this sauce, please private message me for a bid.  I washed down these yummy chicken strips with the best sweet ice tea I've ever had.  I only speculate that it has to be made with real honey for that lingering subtlety of syrupy sweetness.",

But I wouldn't go there again. Yes, the chicken was moist breast meat, but the batter, which should have been crispy, was soggy, crumbly and surprisingly flavorless. The magic sauce that everyone raves about? It was some mayo-like, chipotle concoction that added nothing to the overall strip. Even the fries where nothing to write home about. The Texas toast brought back memories of eating at the Sizzler as a child. It was squishy, buttery and toasted and the best thing I had here. So disappointed.",

The total was 10.01, I gave the cashier a 10.00 dollar bill that I had on my hand ready thinking that it would be enough. She stood there waiting for me to come up with the missing penny, I gave her another 10.00 dollar bill and she gave me my 9.99 change back, I took the four pennies and placed them on the side so the next person that needed a penny could use them.  When I got my chicken I realized there was no dipping sauce so I went back to the counter and asked an employee for some ranch for my chicken, the guy looked at me like I had asked for something no one has ever asked for and said \" we don't have that.\"  can I get some BBQ then? \" we don't have that either. \"  you mean. You're out of everything? \" No. we only carry our special sauce \" ( ok, now that you made me feel stupid for asking for something weird like ranch dressing in a chicken finger place ), can I have some of your special sauce, please? \" sure, that'll be 31 cents\"  by now I'm wishing I would've stopped at a 7/11 and got a freaking hot dog, but luckily I had change thanks to employee number one. I handed him 35 Cents that he then handed to employee # 1 (cashier), she was busy taking someone else order so she sat the money on the side and took the four cents that I had previously left and gave them to me as change. WTF!  And now that my rant is out of the way, here's my review........  The Chicken is good and BYOD.      ( bring your own dressing)",

And this is for the chicken fingers that I considered pretty decent.  Raising Cane's chicken fingers completely shattered all my preconceived notions of what great chicken fingers were.  So moist and hot, they should come with a disclaimer, as the hot steam escaping from your first bite will surely burn you.  I doubt that one can even find chicken fingers so good in a sit-down restaurant setting.  The dipping sauce that it comes with is ok, akin to a peppery mayonnaise, but left me wishing that I had one of those little travel size Tabasco sauces.  Next time I will get it to-go or bring my own sauce.  All of this for a price that even a college student would consider a bargain.",

Needless to say, my expectations were pretty high.   Well, we ended up going to Raising Cane's on Sunday afternoon, right before our drive back home. Why we decided to do this, I'm not sure, but thinking back...wow, we were stupid! Anyone who has been through 48 hours of Vegas chaos should know that you probably won't be feeling too great by the time you're through. I managed to take a bite or two of everything - yes, the chicken tenders ARE that moist, the toast IS that good, and the sweet tea IS that clean - before I started feeling nauseous. After about 10 minutes, I had to admit defeat; I closed the lid on my \"Box Combo\", laid my head down on it, and waited for my friends to finish.  Sad, sad day.

I love the following: the crinkle fries, since no one has them anymore; the chicken, which is crispy without being bready, moist without being soggy; the coleslaw tastes nothing like the slop at other chicken places; their sauce is to.die.for.; and they use crushed ice in their drinks, which I love, but I'm not sure why.  Tips: you can purchase extra sauce, but it you sauce properly, one cup should do it. If you bring your dog through the drive thru, they'll sometimes give you a dog biscuit.

    "text": "I'm writing my 400th Yelp review on Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers. Not only 400 reviews, but a 5-star one at that? Get outta here. Seriously though, I was sitting on 399 reviews for the longest time, thinking about what type of \"special\" restaurant I could review. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I'm just a simple dude who loves eating cheap, good food.  Listen, I love chicken. I can cook chicken a bazillion different healthy ways at home. But there's one thing I refuse to do at home, and that's deep frying. It's just too messy, too much of a hassle, and I can't stand looking at all that oil. But when I'm going out to eat, it's a completely different story. I search out for anything that's deep fried.  Thanks to Yelp, I had this place bookmarked for the longest time. On the next Vegas trip, we just had to check it out. The menu is pretty simple, as it all depends on how hungry you are for chicken strips. We opted for the \"Caniac\" combo, which comes with 6 chicken strips, fries, dipping sauce, cole slaw, toast, and drink for about $8. What a steal, and it was enough to feed for 2.  The chicken strips were of high quality, not greasy at all, not frozen, and not overly coated with all that breaded nonsense. When I took a bite, it was nothing but juicy, moist, and flavorful chicken. Dipped in their \"special\" sauce, it was even better. The sauce is a bit hard to describe, but there's definitely mayo, ketchup, and various spices like garlic, cayenne, and black pepper.   The crinkle fries were good, not soggy, crisp on the outside, which is all you can ask for. The surprise, for me, was how good the Texas toast and cole slaw were and how well they complimented the chicken fingers. The grilled toast with butter and garlic was tasty, and the cole slaw was cool and refreshing. I couldn't stop eating the stuff.  If I had things my way, I wished there was the option of more spice with everything. Maybe spicy chicken fingers, some hot sauce, or even a nice red squirt bottle of Siracha. For a fast food joint, I'd take these chicken fingers over something from Chick-Fil-A any day of the week. We seriously need one in SoCal. Now.",

Now that I've begun to eat a little healthier I find that i feel really full right after and than lose energy a few hours later.  I enjoy getting the sandwiches and the Cane's sauce is very unique and gives the chicken just a tiny kick.  For whatever odd reason I also think the ice cubes here are cool, well they aren't cubes but almost perfect circles or hail stones for your soft drink.  Raising Cane's gives you a reason to root for the Rebel's as you get a free \"Runnin Rebel\" combo if they win (so expect a lot of canes in the winter, not so many during fall football ;) )",

    "text": "Raisin Cane's... I wish I never had you because ignorance is bliss. BRING ONE TO SOCAL! 5 Stars for doing what you do, really really well.  These tenders have the crust and texture of a crunchy thick juicy piece of fried chicken, but... it's chicken tender? Definitely not like your typical breaded chicken tender.  They only have ketchup for your fries and their secret sauce for the chicken, but their sauce is all you need, I would get extra.  So now you already have a reason to come here... but wait!  DON'T FORGET THE TEXAS TOAST, IT'S UH-MAZING!  I always get extra toast instead of coleslaw. It has the softness and slightly sweet taste of a sesame burger bun but they cut it in 2inch thick fluffy slices and toast it on a griddle with garlicky butter.   ALSO, I normally don't like sweet tea, but there's definitely something special about their's.  Every time I've gone there, I've had excellent service.  This is always a last stop on any Vegas trip for me. No matter how hung over I am or how drained, I will eat it there or get a Caniac box for the ride home with a giant sweet tea. Even after a 4-6 hour drive home, it's delicious.... if it lasts that long.",

First of all, this was by far the best chicken fingers/strips that I have ever tasted.  I had the 3 Finger Meal and it was VERY delicious. It tastes more like fried chicken and that's awesome. One of the best items that comes with the meal is the Texas toast. I loved the buttery flavor and how soft it was. The crust side has sesame seeds. The fries are also great as well, not oily.   The staff is very friendly. It got busy at this location, as the line went out the door at several occasions. Inside was crowded with customers enjoying their food. The restaurant is clean. I could see a worker on several occasions wiping the tables. The worker even wiped down the seats! Something quite rare to see in these days. So yes, very clean.   I thought the prices for the combo meals were affordable.   In summary, this is a great place that specializes only in chicken fingers. Food is affordable, abundant and delicious. Will definitely return here and be on my list of places to frequent.",

One time my boyfriend and I even took a cab from the hotel just to pick up food from here. That's how badly we wanted raising canes. We had the taxi driver go through the drive thru lol.   This place has forever raised my standards for a great chicken tenders. I have even had a dream that Raising Canes had opened a location in San Diego. What a beautiful dream...hoping one day it will become reality. I would easily sacrifice my local Chick Fil A or KFC for a Raising Canes. Writing this review is very painful, with the images of dipping that crispy chicken finger into the secret sauce haunting my mind.  I order the Caniac Box, it comes with 6 pieces, crinkle fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, two sauces, and a drink. Not a fan of coleslaw so substitute for extra toast and yes, the toast is amazing with a butter taste. The fries are average but at Raising Canes, all you need is the chicken, toast, and sauce. Use the sauce for everything, dip the fries and dip the bread. You will have to pay for extra sauce, but totally worth it.  Next time you are driving into Las Vegas, stop by Raising Canes to kick off your Vegas trip. In my opinion, Raising Canes is as much as a staple for Vegas eats such as Earl of Sandwich and Secret Pizza. Driving back home after a wild Vegas stay is depressing and sad, but stopping by Raising Canes on the way home may brighten your mood. Yes, I have done that before (3 Caniac Boxes to go please). Come to SD please!",

    "text": "Well, I'll give this place stars for frying-up-to-order chicken fingers, food came out nice and steaming hot and prices were really cheap!  It was the first time in awhile we've paid under $15 for a complete meal for two! Other than that, food was ehh okay for me.  FYI: So you kind of know where I'm coming from...I really don't eat at any fast food places, some as long since 1998. Only reason why we were here was 1. Mr. B. is a fan of this place and  2. Everything in the proximity of the outlets were all fast food and 3. I'm fasting for Lent and it's was no red meat Friday.  I ordered the smallest combo offered which was 3 chicken fingers, fries and Texas Toast and all I could think was it was super starchy! Lucky Mr. B ordered the larger combo that included coleslaw.  Since he doesn't like coleslaw and I hardly eat bread, I made a trade.  His coleslaw for my Texas Toast! I think it was a good trade! The coleslaw was nice and cold and crunchy..the dressing was a bit runny though.   Since I limit my intake of starches, I skipped eating the fries too.  Not a fan of the crinkle cut type anyway.   Chicken was good though. Good sized and pretty meaty and the batter was perfect golden brown and didn't fall apart when you took a bite.   This place was pretty small  but easily accommodated everyone even though it was pretty busy. Set up: order and pick up your food when it's ready kind of deal. The employees here though brought out the food to the tables when they had time to.  Also one assigned to bus tables so the place was pretty clean. This place is one of the better alternatives for fast food and I would eat here again if I had to.",

    "text": "After seeing all my friends' Instagram posts of these chicken tenders, I had to try it for myself. I have to be completely honest in saying that... THE HYPE WAS REAL.  Chicken tenders were juicy, coleslaw was refreshing,  the special sauce was creamy, tangy, and peppery. Reminded me of 1000 island but with a twist-- pretty tasty. The Texas toast was actually my favorite part of the meal... Buttery goodness!  Verdict: Overall, the entire meal was alright. It was lacking some sort of wow-factor for me. I think something comparable, but possibly even better, would be Chick-fil-A. It's definitely worth trying at least once! But there are other yummy things in Vegas I crave more.",

Service is fast and friendly, chicken strips are always good, place is always clean, no complaints here!  While you're over here make sure to visit the Welcome to Las Vegas sign!",

The second time I asked for a party tray of chicken strips and a few cups of coleslaw and texas toast, and again it would have been easier to order one of their preset menus. Sorry Raising Cane's! I need to read your menu next time.  but seriously though, that FRIED CHICKEN, TEXAS TOAST, and the SAUCE. SO GOOD.",

I absolutely love their freshly squeezed lemonade, and one trick I do to make sure I enjoy every drop of it is ask for no ice because if you don't they will surely serve you ice with a shot of lemonade.  Learn from my experience. Everything else is great.  Also make sure you don't go during lunch time if you want to have the best experience ever.",

Two of us shared the Caniac Combo, which was more than enough food with 6 crunchy chicken strips, crinkle-cut fries, & Texas toast (which is more plain than some reviews will have you believe, unfortunately.) Cane's dipping sauce is like a zesty thousand island dressing, but spiced differently...cajun, perhaps? Under $10 for this meal, which included a yummy, addictive sweet tea.   Would consider paying them a second visit on my way out of town, as Cane's is en route to LAS.",

They truly have a very unique taste in chicken that I have never tasted in any other chicken.  Very delicious,  very unique and exclusive, and very tender and good quality. I always get the Caniac, which is one of their combo meals. If I do recall correctly, it is their most expensive combo meal at $10. You get 6 delicious chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw,  a large drink, a fatty delicious toast(which deserves a review of it's own for how delicious it is), and their secret sauce that goes perfect with everything in the meal. I usually replace the coleslaw with an extra toast and I'm in heaven. I can eat a lot, so for you hungry folks out there, I reccomend the Caniac because I usually get full with one Caniac combo, though I have been known to eat 2, which at that point im completely bloated, but very rarely can I eat more than 1 Caniac. Also, I get fruit punch High C to drink because it goes perfect with this meal, but that is my personal preference.",

It is kinda hard to impress me when it comes to fried chicken. But I have to say this place is as good as everyone says it is. The chicken tenders are superb! Like amazing- like I could eat them everyday kinda amazing.  They are not only super juicy for white meat (cause I usually order dark meat due to the juicy factor-the breast and the white meat tenders are my least favorite) but the crispy factor was on point. It wasn't oily or flavorless. The crunch was memorable along with the taste.   I wasn't too impressed with the fries-kinda so so- tasteless and a little oily. But the canes sauce they serve is a great dippin sauce- seems like a combo of mayo, ketchup and spices.  I ordered the kids meal- 4.19$ for 2 strips, fries and a small drink. Not too bad but def just getting the chicken next time.  Def going to come and eat here again and brining my husband to experience the tastiness of the chicken here!",

I can make better sauce at home. The fries and coleslaw were nothing special either, I was annoyed at this place by the unsupervised children, one little group of kids kept \"squeezing\" by me over and over between me and a support beam I was sitting by. That day the clientele was ghetto as fuck. I would not return, just to be annoyed by misbehaving children alone.",

Aside from the lemonade being fantastic, the Cane's sauce is by far the best condiment I've ever had in my life! I wish they bottled it up and let you buy it. Great food, basic and non-overwhelming menu makes Raising Canes a family favorite. All locations are consistent with each other, so don't worry you're missing out trying one over the other.

Also, the tea is a lil less sweet that the sweet tea at the Auburn Guthrie's which is fine actually.  Nice, clean, open space and friendly staff - definitely will be coming back!",

All these 5 star reviews must be from Californians who are deprived of food that doesn't taste like absolutely nothing. California = the land of no seasoning; I would know, I lived there for 10 years. These reviews can not be trusted. Yeah, I said it.   Their special sauce sorta tastes like paprika, salt, pepper, and mayonnaise? The honey mustard is decent. They charge $.50 for it but the first time I went the guy behind the counter gave me some for free.   The fries are horrid. They're like the Ore-ida frozen crinkle cut fries. The chicken is good but it tastes exactly like what my mom and I  make at home from scratch for pennies. Homemade is ALWAYS better.   I would love it if they served their food in something more biodegradeable; eat-in orders are even served in styrofoam takeout containers that are never gonna break down. :-(   They need to lower their prices, a couple chicken fingers, frozen fries and toast isn't worth like $7+",

Here's my take on the 3 Finger Combo:  - chicken strips: definitely moist / juicy and cooked to order so not sitting under a heat lamp as they advertise. I was expecting a bit more crunch and batter - sauce: great sauce, although not the orgasmic experience a few mention, but indeed have to have it with the chicken fingers - fries: equivalent to Ore-Ida; can't beat the In-n-Out fresh fries: you can tell the difference - texas toast: mine was a less crunch like they took it out 10 seconds sooner than it should  Kids did eat everything on the kids meal so give Canes credit for that.",

I don't know what's in it, but I will eat it on EVERYTHING - chicken, toast, fries.  Oh man oh man.  Parking kind of sucks since it's in a busy area and I have no experience with the drive-thru.  Sweet tea is overly sweet... I usually mix half sweet tea, half regular tea + a packet or two of Splenda.  Meh.  Service can be slow but at least the food is fresh.  Every now and again their chicken just tastes slightly off - I can't pinpoint why, perhaps different quality batches that come in - but the fries and toast are consistently good.  This location is kind of close to where I live, but not close enough to make it convenient.  Also, the boo isn't too fond of it so I don't really go here that often.  If I am ABSOLUTELY craving southern-type chicken and have some extra cash, I may venture this way.  That's a big \"may.\"  Honestly, I'd probably just go to any fast food place that was closer and end up spending less in time / gas / food.",

My friend and I shared the Caniac, which came with six pieces of chicken fingers, fries, cole slaw, texas toast, a drink, and two containers of their special sauce.  I think it only cost about $8 - cheap.  The chicken fingers were pretty good for a fast food chain but what I really enjoyed was the Texas Toast!  It was soft yet sweet.  Delicious.  I also liked their sauce - it tasted like a blend of ketchup, mayonnaise, soy sauce, pepper and sugar.  It wasn't quite as sweet as I had expected (it has a color similar to Thousand Island but it's definitely different) but it went well with the chicken.  Food came out quickly, too, and the crinkle cut fries were nice and crisp.    Great little fast food joint!",

First had it in their home state on Louisiana and was so excited to find that there are locations in Vegas. The service is always great. The sweet tea is a must. And theres nothing wrong with goin a little overboard and gettin a caniac! One recommendation, if your not high on coleslaw, with the box combo, you can change out the coleslaw for another Canes sauce.",

I sat down and they actually asked me how I was doing and if my food was taking long to come out, and the same crew member even checked up on it after that. On top of that I tried getting some ketchup and a worker offered to get it for me. All in all pretty impressed by their customer service considered it's fast food and you're usually on your own once your food comes out.",

I always make it a point to stop here on the way in to Las Vegas and on the way out. I love everything about this place, from the sweet tea to the amazing dipping sauce!  The food is always fresh and comes out piping hot! The prices are great and the 6 piece combo is definitely enough to split between two people (but add an extra thing of Texas Toast because it is just that amazing).    You will not regret eating at this place.",

    "text": "Looking for good food that doesnt break your wallet like everything else in Vegas? Well, this is definitely the place to go.  Discovered this past weekend, I paid $5.99 for 3 chicken fingers, texas toast, fries and a drink.  Don't underestimate this meal, it actually will make you full. Included with the chicken fingers is their famous Cane sauce which reminds me of the spread at In-N-Out. So delicious, you want it in every bite. I even dipped the toast in it. Located on Las Vegas Blvd so if you're coming from California, make sure to stop by this place before you check into your hotel (and when you're heading back too).   Really good, satisfying food. Will definitely go again because it's cheap and worth it! Better than Chick fil A in my opinion. Only because their sauce and bread makes them unique!",

The chicken fingers are just chicken fingers but the sauce, toast and fries are what makes this place amazing.  It is definitely no Chick-fil-A but still a great 2nd place.  They charge for extra sauce and lemonade refills (Chick-fil-A does neither).  Other than that it is a great place to grab some food!",

    "text": "I heard about this place when I was watching a TV show about CEO's who go undercover to do go deeds (no...it wasn't Undercover Boss). The Raising Cane's CEO/creator and his wife went down to Louisiana to see where some of their fortune could help out. I thought that was pretty cool even if it was for publicity. So I thought I would give it a whirl.   My monkeys, mom and myself all rolled in and each ordered a combo (I think I got the box lunch and my mom got the smallest one). Oh Dear Lord! The strips were soft, the fries were crinkle cut and perfectly crispy (just like I like them), the cole slaw wasn't too soupy, the Texas toast melted in my mouth and THE SAUCE. Their sauce should be a 5th food group. I put it on everything (strips, toast, fries, fingers).   Their sweet tea and lemonade are quite tasty as well and very refreshing. Will be a loyal patron of Raising Canes because of their genuinely friendly service, great food and nice place for kids.",

    "text": "First off, I have had better chicken fingers elsewhere. I've had better fries, sweet tea, and everything else this place serves.   However.  Cane's puts it all together and pairs it with this SAUCE that I'm sure is just Thousand Island with some black pepper but It makes everything taste better. But then again that is the major flaw of Canes as well in that It needs this sauce to really cross the threshold of beyond \"average\" because without the sauce, the chicken fingers are quite bland and have very little flavor (tasting somewhat like Church's Chicken) despite being juicy and fresh-cooked to order.  The Texas Toast is what does it for me though. I love that bread and it's perfectly grilled every time! The Fries are average fries, there to look pretty and munch on after you are done with the toast and chicken.  The price is right though and the service is fast. Can't complain too much about this place, and the ambiance of the actual restaurant is good for just sitting and conversations.   And the mascot is a DOG WITH SUNGLASSES so that bumps the star count to 5",

I miss their delicious dipping sauce that comes with the chicken fingers. I miss their Texas Toast. And I definitely miss their sweet tea. I always had to mix their sweet tea with regular tea because it was a tad bit too sweet for my taste buds. But I still miss it!  It's been a while since I've had it last. But I enjoyed it so much that I just had to express my love for it through this review.",
