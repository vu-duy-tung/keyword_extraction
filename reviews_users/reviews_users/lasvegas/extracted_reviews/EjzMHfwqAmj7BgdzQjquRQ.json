    "text": "I had a very solid meal for lunch.  We chose this place as it's conveniently located near the office I work at.  Plenty of room for a big group on a weekday at noon.  Our table ordered a bit of everything and were pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the dishes.  The food looked a little higher end than your typical Mexican restaurant.  The dishes also leaned towards a more healthy alternative rather than the usual beans and rice base of Mexican food.  Personally I had the Chipotle veggie wrap with street corn.  I thought the dish was very good, but could have used a little more spice.  Still, it offered healthy wrap at an affordable business lunch price.  The other standouts at the table appearance-wise were the turkey salad, steak sandwich, and tacos in general.  The salsa and chips are typical and nothing too unique.  The service wasn't the fastest and the dishes came out in groups rather than all together so many of the diners had food for 10 minutes before our last person received their dish (10 people total).  Seemed like they need to get the food preparation and timing down; that will come in time as Bandito did only recently open.  But overall a nice addition to the area.",

When my item showed up, it was barely room temp.  Overall flavor was good but needed a sauce or something to liven it up. They also need some hotter salsa.  The waitress over charged us for the sides even though they were included.  It all ended up being fixed but the lunch turned into an exceptionally long lunch.  The decor is fabulous and very chic.  Very modern and inviting.  Will have to go back after they have been open a bit longer...perhaps for happy hour.",

I only wish there had been a pineapple wedge in it. The queso fondido was soooooo amazing. My favorite thing of the whole meal. We also ordered the fish tacos (not great) and the pastor tacos (pretty good but would be better shredded instead of cubed). For our side we got the corn which was delicious. The only think I would change is that the plates are so tiny! It was hard to eat off.  I LOVED the decor and atmosphere. Staff was excellent. We will return to try more.",

Totally recommend the ceviche which is a mix of shrimp, octopus and a firm white fish and several citrus fruits and passion fruit, great new little twist.  Street style tacos were great tried grilled halibut, carne asada and carnitas all were on point and great tasting.  Definitely try a mixed drink, venture past the Margaritas and try something new.  Both the wife and I tried their house specials and loved them well worth the price.",

    "text": "Bandito Latin Kitchen & Cantina located in the Hughes Center. Frontage on flamingo just between Koval & Paradise. The art work and decor gives a cool vibe ! There's a couple things I might change ! Still a cool looking spot overall.  Being from a family full of Mexican food chefs and restaurant owners from Mexico , we can tend to be a little picky. Had to bring my mom in to give this place a second chance since she didn't care for her first experience.  She ordered the Baja fish tacos the 2nd time around and she was satisfied. Woohoo! Lol.   I ordered the carnitas enchiladas with salsa verde crema Which I did enjoy. They actually prepare the enchiladas and add the protein on top of the enchilada which I thought was different. I actually think I'd prefer it that way now!   There's a few things on the menu I'd like to come back and try but i come here during lunch hours on lunch break . Perhaps on a Tuesday I can come back at happy hour for taco Tuesday as tacos are 50% off.  There are a couple of recommendations id like to make in-regards to the food ingredients/taste etc.   I am not a fan of the salsa. We make salsa at home weekly. I know not everyone likes it the way I do however these salsas not only are way too mild and had no kick at all (I don't mind mild salsa at all) but these salsas were sweet tasting. When I don't finish all of the chips and salsa you know something is off for me. Perhaps offer something with a little more kick or even a little spice?  In addition I noticed the same type of consistency in flavor with the rice and beans. It almost had a sweet taste to them as well. Now that i think about it if i could id just ordered the enchiladas alacart or just minus the rice and beans (I love rice n beans tho!) and keep the 3rd side they do offer like roasted veggies or corn. I did enjoy the complimentary guacamole upon check in. The place wasn't too packed and the service was good. I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt by giving them 4 stars . I think it has good potential . Hopefully I can get back in here and try some cocktails and other dishes!",

I had no idea it would be an awesome unique food experience!  As we walked up a handsome employee opened the door for us, and I was very impressed. I assumed he was a manager, but he turned out to be our waiter. Oh boy, this man was awesome! He put up with so much from our group. One person didn't like their drink because they were unfamiliar with ginger beer, he was super sweet about that and it wasn't a problem. Then they wanted enchiladas but the sauce choices were tough to decide. Our wonderful waiter brought out decent sized cups of every one of the sauces for all of us to try! Well, that sold the enchiladas for me. I loved the one sauce he recommended so much I just went with everything he said he would order and I was not disappointed. Now the only thing that is a bummer, I do not know his name. But I know one person from our group went out of her way to tell the manager that he deserved a raise and that's the truth. He made our visit memorable and went above and beyond. I was happy I got a separate check so that he could be tipped super well.  Thanks! I hope to return someday with the hubby!",

We ordered the guacamole to start (which we got for free for checkin' in)!  We also both got margaritas on the rocks ($9 each).  They were delicious! And strong (that's always a win).  I ordered the brick pressed roasted chicken which was pretty tasty.  It had roasted vegetables, potatoes al pastor, pickled fennel, guajillo, and chicken thyme jus.  My mom had the tacos al pastor, which she also really liked.  This came with manchego cheese, white onion, and pineapple. It also came with corn, beans, and rice.    Our bill for the both of us came out to around $60 - not too bad.  We absolutely loved the decor!! Beautiful restaurant.",

The not so good: the ceviche was bland and the flautas were ok. We had our daughter (who is under 1) with us and she was trying to interact with everyone including all the employees and the bartender made a stupid snide comment about her hair and how she needed a haircut. Not cool, dude. Not cool.   I hope the manager reads this and trains their staff that snide comments need to be kept to themselves and are not needed.",

    "text": "Happy hour just got a whole lot better!   First thing you'll notice about Bandito is how beautiful it is, the art and decor are so nice, you WANT to sit here and eat. Then get ready to hear some nice music, the atmosphere is set.  I've been here a few times, if you go alone I recommend sitting at the bar. They've got some top notch bartending going on!   First things first, the BARBACOA Michelada is the best damn Michelada in Vegas...the spice used to salt the rim and make the chelada are perfect! Not too spicy, but not bland, then some genius decided to put a chunk of barbacoa on top of this. Muchas gracias!   FOOD:   Be bold! Get the pulpo fritto (fried octopus)! Its It's fried calamari, definitely marinated in lime which I love, and not over cooked. I then recommend the sopes, I was pleasantly surprised with veggie sopes and obviously the barbacoa one is killer, not too crazy about the sweet pork, reminds me of Cafe Rios a bit.  Guacamole and queso fundido is average, not that much guacamole or flavor compared to say a Lindo Michoacan or Segundo Sol.  Tacos here are also decent, I'm gonna say the best meat here is the barbacoa because the flavor and tenderness are so perfected.   Customer Service:  The staff here is great, they make sure you have all you need and more. Took my coworkers once and the waitor was friendly and they loved the place because of the service.   Overall I'm glad Bandito is here in Vegas!",

Why even advertise meat on the plate description when your only providing a sample size piece of meat. The taco was drenched in some salsa, and again the meat was non-existent in the taco. The tamale was flavorless, only tasted the salsa it was saturated in. Overall, this place is an overpriced Mexican restaurant for no reason other than it's location. I understand you have higher rent but come on your customers should feel satisfied after spending 15$ on a combination plate. What a disgrace of a combination plate. You should call your combination plate more of a sampler and put some toothpicks on the three small items provided.

We attended Bandito during a media event and decided to use the opportunity to get a good sampling of foods and drinks.  Bandito is a fusion/modern mexican/Latin restaurant in the vein of Border Grill and Mesa Grill.    We started off or I should say we should have started with appetizers but most everything came at once (the soup came five minutes latter).  The Queso Bandito was one of the best I've had, quality cheese well prepared, but at most places, traditional and fusion, it would have  come with tortillas.  The fried octopus was one of the worst dishes I've sampled. The octopus was tough, lukewarm, and bland. The chicken tortilla soup had a strange thick chipotle like broth. The soup like most of dishes we sampled was attractively plated but not satisfying in any way.    The main dishes were not much better, my wife had the habenero shrimp and carne asada and I had the special-barbacoa nachos. The shrimp were well cooked, but the carne asada was tough and chewy. The barbacoa nachos was great looking but very disappointing dish. The chips, cheese, beans, and pico were tasty but barely there. The brisket barbacoa was tough, stringy, and dry and there were mounds of it on the dish. This is the first time I wish a nacho dish came with less meat. The meat reminded me of Cuban ropa vieja, but not nearly as tasty.  Barbacoa in quality traditional and fusion restaurants is braised or slow roasted and grilled-using beef cheeks or ribeye cuts. Barbacoa should be succulent, tasty, and fatty in great naughty way. The Bandito barbacoa was not even close. I had high hopes for Bandito based on the ambiance and attentive service but was greatly disappointed.  On up side the drinks and the queso were excellent so we may be back for happy hour.",

    "text": "Trendy restaurant serving classic Mexican dishes with a twist, but actually delivers on flavor is how I would describe Bandito. I stopped by for dinner and was able to grab a seat before the real dinner rush came it. Right when you walk in, you will see a little luche libre wrestler by the hostess table.   The atmosphere here is industrial chic with a warm bright Latin wall mural by the back. The restaurant is upscale enough for a nice outing, but not too good for a pair of casual jeans and flip flops. It was already busy when I went in the evening, but service was prompt. The watermelon mint agua fresca was refreshing. The cup was not as big as I would have liked it, but that's ok. The cup was rimmed with salt which was a first for me for agua fresca. Still tasty. The steak was very flavorful and the elote was an easy favorite. I think the chef did a good job of just seasoning all of the food without salting everything and using chili peppers and herbs to bring out the flavor of the meat, the rice, and even the guacamole. Be sure to try the churro with the dulce de leche ice cream! It's a great way to wrap up a flavorful meal here. Will be back!",

    "text": "My husband and I recently enjoyed lunch here and we were very impressed with the food, ambiance, and service.   Since it was a hot day we started with a couple of the Agua Frescas and found them to be very refreshing. The Tamale Trio was our shared starter and that was delicious. The complimentary chips were good. We loved both the red and green salsa that were served with the chips.  I went with Carnitas Tacos as my entree and loved the flavors on the tacos. The orange glaze on the meat added a great flavor. The beans and rice on the side were tasty. For my third side I chose Mexican Street Corn and enjoyed that as well. The tacos were loaded with meat, but sides were on the smaller side. I loved the overall portion of the meal and thought it helped me avoid going overboard. My husband had the Turkey Chorizo Torta and loved it.  When dessert time came around we were told that the only dessert was a brownie. My husband is weird and doesn't eat chocolate in the form of brownie or cake so we had to pass. The waitress returned soon after with an amazing cheesecake made with serrano peppers and topped with a strawberry watermelon salsa. There was a nice caramel drizzle on the plate. It's a dessert that the restaurant is testing to possibly add to the menu. I thought it was so nice of them to bring this out since I love my desserts and was sad to have to decline the brownie option. The cheesecake was amazing too! I really hope to see this become part of the regular dessert menu. The cheesecake had an excellent flavor and the peppers inside added a nice heat that wasn't overwhelming. The fruity salsa really balanced the heat and the caramel was delicious.  Our waitress was attentive and everything we ordered was delivered to the table without a long wait. The manager, I believe his name was Julian, checked in on us several times. He wanted to make sure that everything was great with both food and service. They were both great and I really couldn't think of anything to suggest that could improve our experience!  We'll definitely be back and I hope to see the cheesecake on the menu!",

Recently came in with a group to try a bunch of dishes, and I'm looking forward to going back to try a few more.   The chicken flautas were one of my favorite dishes, with a mild dipping sauce and a flavorful filling. The nachos are served as a giant mountain and worth the upcharge to add protein- the asada was nicely soft but I also liked how juicy the carnitas was without sacrificing crispiness! The quesadillas were also a hit at our table, and the ceviche impressed in that what we initially thought were pieces of giant Peruvian corn were actually scallops. I will do some shady shit for nacho cheese, and I was disappointed to find that the queso fundido was thin and lacked flavor. I'm not much of a drinker but I appreciated that the $5 margs were a full glass rather than the smaller pours I've seen elsewhere. They were out of the octopus when we went, so I'll definitely be returning to give that a shot along with the sope sampler.",

The pork atop the tortillas was tough. The classic enchilada sauce tasted primarily of tomato paste. The tortillas were nicely soft and slightly chewy. Inside was just cheese, which sort of made them eat like blintzes.   The charred corn side was smokey, starchy, and properly seasoned.   The beans and rice were just there. They were OK, but didn't pack any interesting flavor profile.   Overall, while the service was excellent, I thought the food was just OK.",

    "text": "Came here last evening to check out the HH (4:30pm to 6:30pm) with some of the local Yelp/Instagram/foodie friends. Thanks Nikki (aka @misohungry_vegas) for taking the initiative to organize this casual get together. I probably would still be in the dark about this new restaurant on E. Flamingo (between Lawry's The Prime Rib and McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks), waiting for Yelp to alert me to this hot new restaurant.  The restaurant's high ceiling, the huge murals, the open kitchen design, centrally-accessible well-stocked bar, lots of exterior floor-to-ceiling glass windows with natural lighting for that natural lighting all food bloggers love, yeah, the decor and interior design of the restaurant are amazing. The restaurant signage out front almost felt too subtle, at least during the day time.  Anyway, yesterday was another scorcher just like the preceding EDC weekend, except it was a few degrees warmer in the open oven we called Summer in Las Vegas. So in spite of having the car AC on full blast, I was quickly wilting away on the drive over and was very appreciative of Bandito's demonstration of the marvels of industrial air conditioning, essential to survival in this present state of daily excessive heat warning.  So once we were inside and greeted warmly by the host, who walked us over to our table, our waitress introduced herself and recommended their Bandito Margarita (just $5 during HH), which we both declined. Sorry, not a drinker. But the ones our friends ordered when they arrived shortly looks great in those colorfully sparkly glasses it was served in. They liked it and all opted for a second round.  As far as our food order, we ordered from their HH special (1/2 off appetizers), and the only item we wanted to try but didn't order was the octopus (86 from the menu for the night since the quality did not meet the chef's standard).  Queso Bandito ($4 HH). Pretty cheesy, but we failed at our attempted cheese porn. When it was dropped off at our table, the cheese was really hot making it way too runny, so it thwarted our effort to contribute to the hashtag meltedcheese, hashtag cheeseporn, hashtag cheesepull communities. But the caramelized part on the edges are extra yummy.  Chicken Flautas was a solid hit ($6 HH). The five of us easily K.O. this fried appetizer, the way Samuel Peter KO Jeremy Williams in the second round of their 2004 NABF title match. Poor Flautas.  My personal favorite is the cheesy Chicken Quesadilla ($6 HH). Every Mexican restaurant serves it, but not many does it the way Bandito's does it. And as a public service announcement for all the food bloggers even thinking about getting that perfect melted cheese porn action for their social media account and their followers viewing pleasure, let me just remind you of that popular and over used phrase \"No pain, no gain.\"  Guacamole ($4). You get a sizable mound of it on a small dish. It was good. I would have loved to be able to order this while mindlessly chipping away at it with the complimentary chips and salsas, while watching the 2017 NBA Finals! #Dubnation!!!  But we ordered a lot of food and some came with guacamole too, so surprisingly the guacamole survived all 10 rounds. There was even a tablespoon worth left on the plate, since everyone was too polite to finish it.  Seafood Ceviche ($6 HH). Beautifully presented with the shrimp, baby scallops, white fish forming a small mound topped with its garnishes. It is a simple and refreshing dish to eat in this heat, but the simple plate of seafood makes for a surprisingly challenging subject to photograph. Just imagine if there is a gallery that have all the photos ever taken throughout the entirety of time of just Bandito's Seafood Ceviche, it would be pretty easy to identify who has either the talent or skill of a photographer, and it would be interesting to see how the really good ones frame and shot their picts. Wow, that was totally random :p  Let's see we also ordered a Nacho ($5 HH), with a Carne Asada add-on (extra $4). There was a mix up and we ended up with a Carnitas one as well. The nachos are huge and definitely meant for sharing. But you certainly can order it all for yourself if that's  your thing, in which case I would definitely get the guacamole plus add on a protein and really make it a meal. Needless to say, we failed to slay the nacho dragons.  The group's HH get together was wallet friendly too. The total bill was only $70, that's including 6 Bandito's Margaritas (HH). Perfect for a cheap Tinder date, which I wouldn't know anything about since I refuse to be forced to sign up witching FB (even a fake one just for all the annoying apps on the FB authentication bandwagon).  I shall end this 4 star review here, since there are plenty of TMI inserted in the review already.  Stay hydrated, don't give the excessive heat a chance to score that KO my friends! And watch out for one another. Hashtag TheEnd",

Despite the fact that our ladies night ran on for hours (longer than intended) and well past happy hour, our server didn't make us feel uncomfortable as if we we were taking up one of his tables. He kept the waters and bottomless chips/salsa coming even after we finished our meals. Overall wonderful experience! Great menu options, they have something for everyone. Will definitely be returning.   Closer towards the evening,the lights dim and more upbeat music plays. Gives the place a lounge feel. Loved it! They have daily specials as well as a happy hour! Perfect for large groups or a solo dinner date.",

We had some of our executives in from Portland and we wanted to take them to dinner and I suggested Bandito since it was close. We were greeted with such warmth from the staff that we knew this was going to be a memorable night. We started the evening with a round of watermelon margaritas (amazing) and some delicious appetizers and their green salsa was the best I ever had. Since I wasn't to familiar with the menu I asked our server (wish I knew here name she was incredible l) what she recommend was their secret menu which I'm not good not to say cuz it's a secret, shhhhh lol.    This place is a must! Kent and partner Dan or Doug or Dennis I can't remember his name but you guys have an amazing place, you'll def be seeing me again.",

Great date spot! I brought my family in however as we all were vacationing together and they have a killer happy hour and it was also taco Tuesday! Best of both worlds! We had queso served with warm tortillas, hand made fresh guacamole, chips n salsas with green and red salsas. My mom is vegan and the chef even personally came out to see if he could accommodate any of her needs! Wow! That is fantastic service. The owner Kent was making rounds and stopped by to ensure everything was fantastic and we were happy to report it was! Our server, Edgar, was amazing. Flawless service, answered all our questions and gave us the right amount of space to just relax and enjoy with family. The service staff was on point with refills for chips/ salsas, my dad's sodas, and our margarita glasses were never empty (as we requested). This goes down as my new favorite restaurant when I stop in Vegas and would highly recommend this restaurant to all! Happy hour is 4:30-6:30 daily. Oh, dessert was outstanding as well. Churros, as simple as they seem, are difficult to get perfect and ours were perfection. Thanks Kent and your excellent staff for the best dinner we had out to eat alll week! Can't wait to come back :)",

    "text": "I came here for Happy Hour on a Tuesday with my friends and was very excited to finally try this spot. I haven't heard much about it but the decor and atmosphere looked great when i walked in. My friends and i ordered margaritas ($5 for HH is a steal.. and they were strong) then we proceeded to look at their food menu. The server told us that all the appetizers were half off during HH (also a great deal being that their prices were a bit high for Mexican food). So...I ordered the fried octopus, ceviche, and chips and salsa. My friends ordered guac, nachos and sopas. *Note: they do not have any taco specials for taco Tuesdays. (Update: So apparently they do have a Taco Tuesday special...however our server didn't mention anything about it. Wish I knew!)  Let's start with my fried octopus... turns out it was NOT octopus. I grabbed a big piece and cut it in half and thought it didn't look like octopus. I took a bite of the half i had cut off and guess what...? it was chicken (texture and flavor of chicken breast, not octopus-if you've eaten octopus before, you'd know that it has a chewy yet tender texture). I had my friend try a piece as well and she also confirmed that it was a piece of chicken. I couldn't believe that this overly fried, almost burnt tasting piece of \"octopus\" was a chicken nugget. For the record, I've had octopus many times in different ways.. grilled, fried, raw, etc. I immediately told my server and without any explanation or reassurance, he apologized and took it away. Now my ceviche was good (it was on the sweeter side because of the mangoes but it was tasty), along with my chips and salsa which was fresh. The server even brought out their habanero salsa which was so delicious(super spicy but flavorful). The guac was average and the nachos were very sad looking (very plain and boring with minimal toppings). The sopas were good but the protein (carnitas & carne Asada) on them were small.   Overall, the margaritas were nice and strong, the habanero salsa was my favorite, and the server was attentive and kind. Besides that, the portions for HH is extremely sad. It just felt very pretentious because you can tell that the portions were definitely \"HH portions\". I'm pretty disappointed at the fact that they served me \"fried octopus\" when in fact they were friend little pieces of chicken. I honestly feel tricked.. I don't know if they ran out of octopus or what but they could've just 86'd the item and save us the trouble. The server was kind enough to take it off my check but a manager never came to the table to apologize or explain/justify the fried faux octopus. I don't think I'd come back to Bandito.. but if it did, I'd only get a margarita and chips/salsa anyways which means i can go to any other Mexican restaurant with better prices and portions.",

The margaritas were small and 15.00 for their version of a Cadillac margarita in a rock glass, seriously? Your not Del Frescos.  This place was over priced and charging you for the decore not the flavor.  Eat at your own risk! The service was also slow, management needs to improve in flavor and service.",

I would just recommend that they improve their achiote rice recipe and their charro beans...they were very bland.",

The food I was very disappointed I would rate it a 3/10  the menu was only a page long not much to chose from and  not what I was expecting at all. Funny thing is the drink menu had more options. My appetizer was the soup it was room temperature (not hot)and too spicy and I order a side of Mexican corn which was really good! My entree was the tacos which wasn't good I think Roberto's taco are way better! Lol I did order a cocktail which was ok. So for the price which is more then a traditional Mexican restaurant was over priced just not worth it!",

Location is just off the strip so you can get away from it all with a simple jaunt down flamingo ... the ambience/decor is a breath of fresh air after being in the contrived casinos. Ok... but now the important part. Food.  I love Austin tacos. Love them. Soooo.... that said... we went with the triple taco plate. Carne asada... Al pastor...and the barbacoa. Next level guys. And we drank the house bandito sauce. Haven't had anything approaching an AUSTIN taco anywhere but Banditos here in  Las Vegas.   As we came in, Kent the owner walked around to show us the spray painted murals and just sat for a moment to talk about his approach to putting all this together. It was refreshing. You can tell this is a team here, Our waitress Jessica is just a great human and you can tell they all care about their restaurant experience they serve up.   Love it when you find a place like this!!  I wonder if I could snag an Airbnb within walking distance for the next conference in Vegas.",

    "text": "Um this meal was fantastic! We went for lunch and albeit a little pricey, I feel like it was entirely worth it ! Used the check in offer to get free chips and guac. The guac was tasty. They also bring two types of salsa to the table once you're seated. A red and a green, both were really good, and I'm not sure which one I liked more. I started with the la pinta marg and it did not disappoint !  Super smooth and not too sweet. My dining companion ordered the steak Torta with potatoes al pastor as her side. Both were DELICIOUS! The potatoes are cooked with pineapple and have an amazing semi spicy sauce on them! With the help of our waitress, I selected the carne asada burrito, fried, and topped with a blood orange habanero sauce as my entree. Street corn off the cob was my choice of side. Again both were fantastic. The burrito was loaded with carne asada, and the sauce had so much depth of flavor! The street corn was insane ! My only complaint was that it was such a small portion, I could've eaten double the portion ! Overall this place is pretty cool. Well decorated. Friendly service. And the food is BOMB.",

    "text": "What an excellent experience in gastro-opulence and patron-focused service. My friends/ colleagues and I are in town for a review course at The Tuscany and had 45 minutes for lunch.  We stumbled upon this delight and were immediately enchanted by the good vibes, music, and decor of this establishment.  The hostess greeted us heartily and seated us outside upon our request, ensuring that our table was clean.  Our waiter greeted us with ice waters and scrumptious chips and salsa.  We basked in the sun and niches through 2 baskets of the chips and dip to which they asked if we would like a third. Only one (out of three) of us rightfully declined.    Our food followed soon after, and, unfortunately, one of our orders was incorrect. We didn't have time to re-order so had it removed from the bill. I can say that my order was a bit wrong, but absolutely delicious. I devoured the burrito with veggies and the mole rojo sauce.  The owner can out to apologize for the wrong order, offering by to remake it on the House. That is superb service. No one was upset or looking for a free meal. I offered half my burrito (using mostly pantomiming because my mouth was always full).  But the team at this restaurant saw to ensuring that our experience in their restaurant be excellent. Can't wait to go here again.",

First, we arrived at 4pm and their happy hour doesn't start till 4:30, so I was surprised when our waitress said she'd give us the happy hour deals anyway-- Score!  I immediately checked in on Yelp and got some free guacamole-- Double Score!  We ordered a beer and a margarita for $5 each, and started off with our guacamole, some queso, chips and salsa.  The queso is big. Very good, but also very large and heavy. I'd recommend only ordering this if you're looking for a gut-buster and have more than 2 people... this will fill you up.  Sopes- We ordered the appetizer sopes, which had 2 beef, 2 carnitas, and 2 veggies. The veggies were just ok, but the carnitas and beef were outstanding.  Tamales- Almost the same, one beef (huge tamales, cut in half), one carnitas and one cheese. My boyfriend loved them. He said they could have used a little more meat and sauce, but they were great. I ate a little bit of each, but I've never really loved tamales, so my opinion isn't nearly as valuable if you're looking for whether or not they're solid.  The Mexican street style corn- An absolute MUST. You're tastebuds will thank you. The corn isn't nearly as heavy as some of the street corn I've had in the past (loaded with mayo). Their corn almost has a creme fraiche style sauce and is creamy, tasty and I'd take it home to mom and marry it.  This place is solid. I'll definitely be coming back again!",

Now, I'm going to get the names of the dishes all messed up...but the plata a la plancha with carnitas was so YUMMY!! I especially enjoyed the roasted veggies that were charred and sizzling from the bottom of the cast iron. Now, I don't really understand the habanero sauce that was on top of the dish, but the meat was cooked perfectly, so who cares. I didn't touch the accompaniments because I'm on a keto diet...so the meat and veggies were a PERFECT dinner for me. I didn't miss the tortillas, rice and beans at all.  My BF had the habanero shrimp and added steak option. SOOO good.   Jose was a server.  Incredibly attentive without being overbearing.  He described all the food in great detail to help us understand all of the fancy Mexican herbs that we had never heard of before.    Definitely will be back...maybe for happy hour on a non-work nite.",

FOOD: The Queso Bandito $8 arrived piping hot and amazingly delicious! Highly recommended starter.  Habanero Shrimp $22 When I read Habanero from the menu I was honestly expecting to exhale fire like a dragon but with some reassurance from our very informative server Natalie the Habanero was actually more savory and not spicy at all. (I was totally pleased) The shrimps are big and plentiful, the veggies were perfect and the tamale was flavorful. Moment of silence for the upscale presentation!!   Great wine selection (Cabernet) $11.00 La Pinata $11.00 perfectly crafted cocktail!!   Serrano Brownie $8.00 was lick the plate clean worthy!  FREE GUAC W/ YELP C/I: Most of it slid right off the \"plate\" and overall wasn't worth the painful wait!   The Fried Fish Tacos $21 Unsatisfactory dish! For such a bold restaurant I was expecting more flavor and regrettably, it was bland. I was uber excited to try the Mexican street corn and it was a total let-down!! Dry, equally bland and gross! The yelp pictures are deceiving or I wasn't lucky enough last night to get a good batch!  SERVICE: The service started sooo slow & literally took 25 minutes for guacamole. I had to remind my server and so did the nearby table before a gentleman finally delivered it. Another gentleman attempted to clear my queso off the table without even asking! Can you believe that? I gave him the evil eye instead of a piece of my mind. As a result he put it back down quickly!! There was plenty left (uncertain how he missed that). Natalie definitely recovered in the service area on behalf of her co-workers; which made my outdoor dining experience decent. Great restaurant concept but some employees lack confidence like it's their first day. Walking in circles and continually asking what we ordered became annoying after a long work day!   $88+ tip  Unsure if I'll return anytime soon and that feeling sucks because they are nearby my office.",

    "text": "Bandito's name says Latin kitchen.  It is not a typical Mexican restaurant.  It seems they break the mold with what they do--and they do it well.  I was brought water and iced tea as I was looking over the menu.  I also showed my server, Jared, my Yelp check in offer of a free small guacamole.  He went off to the kitchen and returned with the guacamole shortly.  It is a bit different than the standard guacamole but it's really good.    I ordered a cup of  chicken tortilla soup and the brick pressed chicken.  Here's where they break the mold again.  The chicken tortilla soup is a tomato based soup with thin strips of chicken breast and topped with tortilla strips.  It is very good.  The skin of the brick pressed chicken is crispy and the dish comes with a variety of vegetables--cauliflower, carrots,  and potatoes and there's a base of chicken thyme jus on which the chicken and vegetables rest.  It's a very light dish and the vegetables are crispy and not cooked to mush.  For dessert, I got the brownie which has a touch of serrano chili.  The round brownie sits atop a round of dulce de leche ice cream and it's topped with whipped cream with a tinge of lime.  This too is very good.  The restaurant is a really pleasant place.  There is patio dining facing Flamingo and now that temperatures are getting cooler, it would be a good place to sit out.  Service was excellent.  My iced tea was always filled, Jared was excellent in explaining questions I had, and it was a very pleasant dinner before the show I had.",

The ambience was very nice and comfortable.  Almost anywhere you sit there are good panoramic views of the area around the restaurant.  This is due to the openness of seating and windows all around, which also allows a great deal of natural light.  We were seated almost immediately (reservations are great) and our server was very attentive.  She made the experience enjoyable and was very willing to guide us through the menu.  Now to the most important part, the food.  We had the carnitas and the carne asada tacos, they were both very good.  The sides were beans, rice and something akin to pico de gallo but with cherry tomatoes.  The beans and rice were passable but not great and the pico was interesting.  We also had drinks (Mojitos) and those were also good.  Overall, we would recommend this restaurant for an enjoyable dinner away from all the crowds of the Vegas strip.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place since they opened. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food so I was eager to see what this place was about.  Went in around 430 or so. It was pretty empty besides a couple of tables. We asked to sit in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour. Hostess wasn't sure if we could have happy hour at the regular tables or just in he bar so we sat in the bar area to be safe.  Our waitress came to us rather quickly. Explained that the happy hour had some drink specials and that the appetizers were half off. We decided to go with a couple house margaritas and the queso fundido.  Margaritas were good. Couldn't really taste the tequila but what do you expect for happy hour. Have it a solid 3/5 for the margarita.  I was excited about the queso. A lot of people spoke highly of it. I guess the big deal is that it comes out still bubbling hot. Other than that it was just ok. After it cooled it was very soupy. Small portion as well. If it wasn't for the happy hour I wouldn't recommend it. I know I know... I'm not cheap but come on, yo can go to places like Lindo Michoacan and get the same for about the same price but a bigger portion... and yes I'm sure you're paying for the quality. But still. Had to give it a 3/5.  Got the cup of tortilla soup. Very disappointed. Flavor was good but there was literally a chunk of what seemed to be previously frozen chicken breast in it. No real ingredients per say. Some tortilla strips on the top and a little cheese but in all honesty the tortilla soup from BJs is a little better. 3/5 also.  Had the elote also. Huge fan of Mexican corn. This was probably my favorite thing here. Corn if off the cob and has that sour mayo taste to it that we all know and love. 5/5 for this for sure.  My friend had a combo that came with the tamale. This wasn't the best I've had and not the worst. Tasted dry and a bit too much mass versus the filling. 2/5 for this one.  I did enjoy the michilada. Pretty tasty and they had the chicharron as garnish. They need to have more options with the chicharron as a the star. Just a salad comes with it. Gave that a 5/5.  Overall it's a fantastic looking spot. Not too far from the strip and it's extremely trendy and clean. But for good Mexican good there's plenty more options.",

When we decided to go for dinner there weren't many people inside which is never a good sign.   Our server was a pro - I'll give him that much. The ambiance is cool, but the food was just \"try too hard.\" Pretentious and snobby. I can make better guacamole in my own kitchen. It was bland and creamy.   I ordered something that our server said is \"our take on fajitas.\" How about we just skip \"your take\" and just serve fajitas like they're supposed to be. Cauliflower just isn't meant to be served in fajitas. Small portions leave you walking away hungry.   The nervous manager that was walking around had a constant look of concern on his face. It's like they know they are trying so hard to be trendy and scared they're missing it. There's a vibe of insecurity within the staff.   I can go to a humble mom and pop place (Restaurant El Rey) a mile away and enjoy way better Mexican food for a fraction of the price.   I'm sure some people will think it's avant-garde but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll let the tourists and conference go-ers from Wisconsin enjoy this place.",

Both my wife and I had enchiladas, which are served as cheese tortillos with the \"filling\" on top. My wife had the carnitas with the \"Red Bandito\" sauce, while I had the al pastor with the \"Habanero Pepper Blood Orange\" sauce. Neither sauce was particularly spicy, but both were flavorful.

    "text": "This location is stunning. The decor is trendy and service was excellent. Amanda was an excellent server. All of the dishes came out beautifully. Sadly, the kitchen sent all of the appetizers out with the meal, except for the soup, which came out later.  Appetizers:  The chips and salsa were fresh and offered amazing flavors. The queso bandito was excellent. It arrived bubbling and was the highlight of the meal. The tortilla soup lacked the typical chicken broth base, leaving you with a chipotle and corn flavor. The octopus was under spiced and over cooked. It was hard and we didn't eat it. The server noticed and removed it from our bill. Drinks: The barbacoa michelada had a nice savory and spicy flavor. The Bandito Margarita was excellent as I love the Cadillac style. The El Guapo was beautiful in presentation, but was super tiny for a $15 drink.  The meal: ( we both ordered the recommended specials) I ordered the habenero shrimp and carne asada was beautiful. The grilled vegetables and tamale were excellent. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and nicely spiced. There was a lot of shells still on them which made them difficult to eat. The carne asada was beautiful but tough. I tried slicing it against the grain into tiny pieces but it was super chewy.  My husband ordered the barbacoa nachos. There was not much cheese or beans which was the most flavorful part of the dish. There was heaps of their version of barbacoa piled high. The barbacoa was more like a Cuban style versus the Mexican traditional flavors. He ended up using the queso dip to dip his chips and left the rest.  We will give them another try for happy hour, sticking to the queso and shrimp. The drinks and service are worth another visit.",

    "text": "Lucky charm strikes again.  Lauren C. made the suggestion of Bandito for dinner.  She has great suggestions!  It was later in the evening on a weekday so it was easy to get seated immediately.  Our waiter, Carlos, was absolutely a gem all night.  He made us feel like VIP's with his service and charm.  His attentiveness was definitely noticed and appreciated.    As per usual Mexican fare, complimentary chips and salsa were brought to the table.   Carlos asked us if we liked spicy salsa and offered to bring out their habanero salsa.   Holy spicy!  But it had a good flavor spicy which we all enjoyed.  My husband and I decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla as well as the Carnitas Enchiladas. The quesadilla was filled to capacity with chicken, charred heirloom tomatoes, caramelized onions and cheese.  The sweet caramelized onions lifted the flavors to greatness.  The dollop of guac and crema sauce gave a nice compliment to the appetizer.    The enchiladas were no slouch.  The tender carnitas rested gently on top of the enchilada that is filled with cheese and your choice of sauce.  It is accompanied with the traditional pico de gallo, guac and crema sauce.  For our enchilada sauce option, we went with the habanero pepper sauce.  This wasn't nearly quite as hot as their habanero salsa but it still had a great kick and flavor.  The normal rice and beans came with it but the dish also comes with an additional choice.  Let's try the Off the Cob Mexican Street Corn!  Yes it was a great choice and would order again and again.  The kitchen was accommodating since my husband has a cilantro aversion.  All of our dishes were cilantro free and he deeply appreciated their awareness.  I'm excited for this unique kitchen and cantina.  Im already looking forward to my next visit!",

The ingredients were of good quality as well.   I recommend the their Sandia margarita. I forgot what beers I had tried but I really enjoyed everything.   As for food I recommend the tamale sampler for appetizer.  The steak enchiladas were not very good..they were too chewy with not enough salsa..I think they just forgot the ghost pepper(or was it habanero?) salsa we requested because we love spice and we didn't get a hint of it. BUT THE STEAK WAS EXCELLENT!",

    "text": "Bandito is a cool little hip Latin flare spot right off the strip. Tuesday nights are taco Tuesdays and so they have a special on their tacos that they serve. This place can get really packed really quickly because the space isn't that big and seating is very close together and reserved. They have great Margaritas especially the Frozen kind, my brother said he he enjoyed his Margarita on the Rocks. They also have some really great non-alcoholic drinks that I suggest you try along with their tableside guacamole. During my visit I ordered the carne asada Taco plate with a side of beans and rice and they're street corn not on the cob I have to say this was the best I've tried while living in Vegas so far.  My carne asada tacos weren't dry in the meat still contain a lot of moisture and flavor. I would absolutely say you should try this place especially on Tuesday nights or Saturday nights if you're in town.",

I ordered the enchiladas with habanero sauce, in place of meat they made them with roasted vegetables. The vegetables included rainbow carrots, purple and white cauliflower - not the typical boring bell peppers and onions.   Great drinks as well! Fresh chips with two types of salsa and you can special order extra spicy salsa made with habanero peppers which has the perfect kick and won't leave your month on fire.   Our server Susan was crazy amazing. Very knowledgeable about the spices, flavors and ingredients that go into the dishes. I've never experienced someone so welcoming at a restaurant.",

The food was fantastic - the guacamole is fresh and creamy, ceviche was perfect and fresh, nachos (with added carne asada) was tasty and huge and just for fun we finished with chicken flautas that were perfectly flaky and full of chicken.   The staff is top notch. We were greeted immediately by the chef who welcomed us from the kitchen as soon as we walked in, the hostess came right over smiled and was cheerful and easy going as we got to decide where we wanted to sit. Our servicer, Colleen was friendly, knowledgeable and super personable; she took super care of us and made our date night super relaxed.   The atmosphere is modern, open, funky and new.

I don't believe the cooks are trained to taste the food before they put dishes out. I thought it was just my dish and then I tried my friends chicken fajitas and the meat was so dry luckily there salsa was decent enough to dip the chicken in so it was bearable to eat. You would find a better meal at a Robertos. Go here if you only want margaritas and chips n salsa. Don't waste you money on anything else.",

We then were promptly sat.  They brought out more water and then chips and salsa,  the salsa is fantastic and you get both a tomatillo and another tomato based and they are great!  I was talking with the waitress and I mentioned I like spicier salsas and she brought me another one that was fantastic.  We also got the guacamole and it was one of the best I have ever had.   We then ordered and I got enchiladas with the fabulous Mole sauce and my sweat heart got the tacos, we both did the barbacoa (SP?) and it was very tasty.  It was a little fatty but that just added to the flavor.   You will not be disappointed at all.  PS. Get the Mexican style corn it is great!",

Our waiter, Carlos was very friendly and great at answering questions and making suggestions. I would recommend either the fish tacos or the al pastor enchiladas. I also enjoyed the tasty watermelon margarita. Only comment for improvement would be the rice, a little too crunchy for my liking. Tuesdays are half off on tacos, a good deal to keep in mind if you're planning your dining for the week.",

Waitress told us that pretty much everything is made from scratch in this kitchen. Including the margaritas (no premix for sure) Probably the best guacamole I've ever had. Meals were all good.  We went with a group of 10 and everyone enjoyed their meals as well And hubby told me to tell you the Bandito Margaritas are awesome.  Oh, and they brought little churros for us for desserts.  We are with too much eagerness for me to remember to take any photos, so please use your imagination.   Imagine delicious appetizers, meals and drinks, followed by yummy little churros.  And while you are at it, imagine we are all beautiful people at the table.",

I ordered the taco plate with Al Pastor and Carne asada with a cheese and jalapeno tamale. The carne asada was savory with a distinct sweet flavor from the pickled onions, the al pastor was similar in taste a savory with a hint of sweet from the pineapple . The beans and rice are similarly run of the mill nothing really stands out, the tamale I was very excited about but was disappointed unfortunately because the masa was very dry and there was little to no cheese or jalapeno, the red suace overwhelmed the flavor of the tamale itself.  My friend ordered the same plate but ordered the \"of the cob Mexican street corn\" aka an elote. This was obviously very good! So in my opinion skip the tamale go for the corn!  For desert we ordered the tres leches cake and omg we saw  stars! it is very good it's not overly sweet just perfect! It is denser than the run of the mill market tees leches and you can see the hints of vanilla bean in the batter within the cake! They topped this with house-made whipped cream which was subtle sweet touch  and strawberries just perfect.",

The staff look as if they're bored and wander around aimlessly which made my group a bit uncomfortable. The food was very lackluster, very bland and honestly not good. When we finally decided to leave one of the servers decided to take her tip from my friends cash and returned her change with no receipt for verification. When the manager was contacted he proceeded to tell my friend that there's nothing he can do. Overall my friends and I understand this is a new restaurant but if you expect for repeat customers or for people to recommend to others they will need to improve in a lot of areas. 0/5 would recommend or return.",

Deliciously fabulous...whilst waiting for friends I enjoyed these in the bar area and moved to  the dining room when my friends arrived...after being kindly escorted to our table, we began a food ordering frenzy! Guacamole, queso, ceviche, habanero shrimp with a jalapeno tamale, flautas...you name it, we ordered it. I think we barely spoke while we ate...everything was DIVINE. My friends also ordered mojitos and micheladas which they raved about...the manager Julian was sure to stop by and chat with us during our meal...what a fine gentleman...we felt so welcomed and looked after...which often times in Vegas, is a lost art in the hospitality industry...we can't say enough good things about this new neighborhood gem! We will most certainly be back often. Thank you Bandito for a wonderful evening out!",

I ordered the carnitas burrito. Carnitas directly translates into \"little meats\", but my burrito was stuffed with pork more akin to stew chunks. In addition, the meat was sorely bland. It was certainly no carnitas.   My burrito was topped with \"blood orange habanero sauce\". It looked a bit more like baby food - pureed butternut squash. The texture and taste was pretty close to pureed butternut squash as well...with a hint of citrus and a tiny bit of heat. I mean, it was tasty - really. It was good, but I envisioned a sweet Citrus sauce with the warming burn that habanero lovingly gives...not ultra-mild squash.   $15 for two street tacos is also a bit of a reach, but that's vegas I guess.   3/5 because the food is just *okay*.",

We enjoyed Sangria with our order of numerous appetizers with happy hour that included taquitos and mini sopas and shared a keto friendly dish made with squash all had lots of color and flavor. All very good will be back to try more entrees.",

It feels like this place is trying to find its identity.  With zero luck.  Their menu is confusing with all the different sauces...and the poor waiters have to spend 10 minutes explaining how the menu works!  Being from San Diego, California, we are used to great Mexican food.  This restaurant doesn't have a chance.  The silver lining?  They make a great margarita, albeit expensive, and their chips and salsa are good.  UPDATE:  We gave this restaurant another shot (since it's right across the street from us) and it was A LOT better than the last time we visited!  I had the chicken flautas which were outstanding and their guacamole is to die for!",

The staff is absolutely disgusting, they drink and eat on the bar, behind it, sit down and watch tv while customers are awaiting service and watching them. They are loud, sneezing on the drink garnishes, not once in the hour I sat and ate my meal did any bartender or server or bus boy wash their hands. NOT ONE. Absolutely disgusting. I work in the food industry and never in my life have I seen such an unsanitary, obnoxious, and disrespectful set of crew. They not only ate the garnishes and then reached in the jar with dirty hands but proceeded to top drinks with dirty strawberries, they were giving dirty looks to any guest who disturbed their \"football game\"; a server even refused to give up his seat for a customer because he was watching the game. Distasteful. Disrespectful. And Disappointed. Never. Again.",

    "text": "I discovered this place from a Facebook advertisement that had caught my attention. We finally made it in a few months later and didn't leave disappointed; but we would had if we didn't have the promotional offer that we came to use. Upon walking in we were immediately greeted and seated. We were asked what we wanted to drink and were given menus. We went to check in on Yelp and saw that in addition to the offer we had, we could also check in to get free chips and guacamole. I remembered seeing the Guacamole on their Yelp before we came and was excited to try it. Unfortunately, the chips and sals were delivered and the guacamole didn't come until after we were almost done with our chips (about ten to fifteen minutes if I had to guess). The guacamole is also deceivingly small as in the photo it looks like a portion large enough for a table of four, this was barely enough for one person. We had emptied out our chips and the server still had not delivered the food we had ordered; granted it takes a long time to cook from scratch but refills of chips, salsa and water should be provided especially because it was a very slow night with only about 4 tables and three servers on staff as well as a manager. When the food was delivered was when the server finally stopped by and asked if we wanted more chips, of course we refused now that our food was here. The food itself was phenomenal. I ordered the stuffed squash and opted to add chicken for an additional $4. I also got a side of Elote (corn and cheese) this was delicious, but no where near worth the $8 they charged for it. Just like the guacamole, it was an underwhelmingly small portion for the price. My BF ordered the fajitas which although tasty, came out in a very small portion and all on separate plates without a plate to use to eat off of once the fajita is made with the tortilla. The server asked how it was right away then didn't come back until long after the food was delivered.   Had we not had a discount; we would have left disappointed. The price point with the discount made the experience welcomed. It's sad that I wouldn't come back here without it considering the lack luster service and small portions for the prices. Don't get e wrong, we eat at high end restaurants frequently, but this isn't one of them; and their price point is double what it should be in my opinion based on the interior, service, location and a few other factors. We will be back when we have the promo, but I suggest they dim the lighting, pay more attention to customers and lower the menu to have the prices make sense for their items. $4 for a side of corn is realistic; $8 for a side of chicken would make more sense.   I'll be back with a coupon for the stuffed acorn squash with chicken; it's something unique and I enjoyed it for the discounted price. I hope they have better customer service next time.",

I guess it is kinda cute and inventive - but we had to look several items up using a translation app to figure out what they were.   Ordered some $18 open tacos and was disappointed. The portion sizes are a little bigger than what you would get from a typical tapas menu. The taste was fine but definitely overpriced for the area. There is a Chipotle in a the connecting parking lot which offers much better value for your Mexican food dollar.   I asked around the table and the most popular dish was the guacamole and chips. That says a lot about the entrees. The waiter did ask how the food was and got several \"it was okay\" type responses.   The wait staff was very friendly and attentive and made sure our dishes were cleared away when empty and brought drink refills regularly. 5 stars for the wait staff.",

I called the number and the answering machine sounds as if they are still an existing/active business. I guess I'll have to sort this issue with my bank since there is no way of getting a hold of this restaurant. Really disappointed.",

I'm always very skeptical of trying New Mexican restaurants especially when it's finer cuisine take on it. My whole life it's just been regular simple Mexican food and I honestly love it that way, which is why I was skeptical. But this place was a very great experience from the amazing margaritas to the delicious food. I wanted more but was too full to keep on eating. Will definitely visit here in my next trip to try different items in their menu. Everything had so much flavor which is what I look for. See you guys soon!",

The chef came out to check on us and ask us how everything was- which  was all amazing.   Great prices for happy hour. Margaritas are $5 and all apps are half off. The food was delicious. And perfect. Best tortilla soup I've ever had.   A great experience all around. Totally want to go back.",

I've made better at home. Chicken flautas were bomb, and gooey from their special in house cheese blend. Red sauce served with them (and on their tamales) is not that great tasting. Cheese enchiladas were good! Carne asada tacos were mediocre. It's almost as if they used real steak as opposed to thinner \"carne asada\" meat (if that makes sense). Guacamole was not worth the cost at all. Also lacked flavor, had to mix it with their salsa verse to get something good going.",

Ashley the server was extremely attentive and helpful with the menu. The food was outstanding as well starting with their homemade salsas. They carnitas plancha came out hot and sizzling and it wasn't just for show. The food was delicious. I rarely order dessert but this seemed like a good opportunity to. I had the tres leeches cake. Huge portion and yummy. Coming from LA and knowing good Mexican food, I can honestly say this is one of the most enjoyable meals I had. Homemade, delicious and satisfying.

Sat at the bar, only had chips, salsa, and guacamole, and it was so good!! I swore I would bring my husband but kinda forgot because we live on the other side of town. Got a Facebook add for buy one get one free entree, so I was ecstatic!! Finally made it over tonight, Thursday, around 6:45pm. They were packed!! Yet, they still sat us without a wait, and let me tell you our waiter was wonderful!! They don't have a huge menu but they have vegetarian options, so color me happy! I got the vegetarian tacos, hubs got the beef enchiladas, and we had chips and salsa. We both loved our food, definitely high quality ingredients, and fresh. The ambiance is awesome, so pretty inside, super clean (including the restroom), and the music is at a perfect volume to where you don't have to yell to have a conversation. As (my) luck would have it, I forgot my phone at home, so I tried to log into my Facebook via hubs phone so I could redeem the coupon, but couldn't remember my password, so I had to have the recovery password sent to my gmail.. gmail wouldn't let me log on thru his phone because it was a \"foreign device\" and the only way to be able to log on so I could change my Facebook password to log on was if it sent a text to my phone for a code (which was at home).. Long story short I was soooo friggin irritated and we just gave up trying and were just gonna pay the normal bill. Our server ended up honoring it for us anyway. I wish I could have remembered his name but he's a younger guy with sort of a long beard.. the service he provided for us was that of a very high end, fine dining establishment. Moral of the story, we will definitely be back and highly recommend this place to anyone! Side note: if you're worried about anyone hacking into your email account, get a gmail account. Their security features are ridiculously strict lol.",

My co-worker and I tried this place for lunch a few days after their soft launch, so we knew going it not to expect 100% on point service. Honestly, the slow service wasn't even that big of an issue. Ultimately I was just not really impressed by the food.   The style was more of 'chef inspired dishes' that failed to wow. The portions were small and the price tag rather large. I had the enchiladas and they were teeny tiny. The sauce options seemed promising, but I wasn't wowed by any of them either. My dish also came with a side of roasted veggies. This happened to be a few slices of bell peppers and two small baby corns. On the bright side, they included chips and salsa at no cost and the chips were quite delicious. They do have a full bar, but we did not partake for this visit.   The space itself is also a little bit on the small side, meaning it's a bit more intimate and not really a great place for a group. We were also informed their 'happy hour' is only for drinks or apps ordered at the bar and two designated high tops. I can't image it being easy to have happy hour here when it's busy on a Thursday or Friday evening.   Merely an average place, but still decent enough Mexican cuisine if you're craving it!",

    "text": "I've been to Las Vegas 5 times and this is among the handful of places I've gone to twice (and the ONLY one I've gone to twice in 24 hours). Their sauces are made in house; we tried the Red Bandito, Creamed Salsa Verde, and Habanero Pepper Blood--highly recommend all (the latter being a little too spicy for me, but perfect for my hubby). We got the chicken tinga enchiladas, from the plancho with white fish, and carne asada tacos--all unreal!! Even the chips and salsa were better than any other Latin restaurant I've been to.   Get the street corn as your side, you won't regret it.   Can't wait to go back to Vegas to eat here again! In the meantime I'm researching how to make my own copycat recipes from this place! Yum!",

Great ambiance & service has also been very good both times.",

The beans and rice were on point and the Mexican street corn was flavorful. The salsas and guacamole were very tasty too!   The staff though! Jose took such good care of us! He was very friendly and even gave one of our girls a dance lesson! Jose stood out but everyone on staff was so nice and attentive. We had to ask for our drinks to be refilled once at the beginning of the night (because we drank them so fast) and didn't have to ask again for the rest of the night.   Thank you so much for the warm welcome!",

Our server was incredibly slow getting our order taken and then placed. The food was ok but nothing really stood out, except the wrong order of tacos that they brought out, or the dessert they brought us before we received our entrees that was supposed to go to another table. It got noticeably worse when other guests were complaining about the 20 minutes it took to get their check. Then we had to ask 2 people to get our check because our server couldnt be found. I really wanted to enjoy this place but I dont think there was anything that would make me want to come back. Great looking resturaunt, decent food, sub par service.",

We had a watermelon margarita and I wanted some spice so I asked the bartender (can't remember her name....super nice girl with a real interest in good service) to throw a little jalapeno in my regular margarita, and it was really good. Guacamole was on point. Very fresh and bright (lots of lime juice! Yum). We shared the carnitas tacos entree which come with rice and beans and a 3rd side. We opted for the jalapeno cheese tamale.

A friend and I wound up here merely because we needed to kill time, and it was close to where we were headed. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Yes, it's small, but I absolutely love the decor and vibe of the place. It was an early Tuesday afternoon (of this week) and we sat at the bar. Unfortunately, I saw no name tag, but our receipt said 'Nicole' was who served us; an African American young lady who was an absolute pleasure. Can't wait to bring my fiance here. The chips were warm and fresh, guac was fresh and served with heirloom tomatoes on top, and both salsas (red and green) were amazing. I cannot WAIT to come back and try more than chips and salsa. As a fellow bartender, I was thoroughly impressed by the drink selection, and the fact they actually have 'mixologists' creating and constructing the drinks. Everything is made fresh.

    "text": "This place epitomizes the very worst of the food industry. It benefits from a good location and nice decor, but things rapidly go downhill from there. A quick glance at the menu items and you immediately know that this is not authentic Mexican but rather a sad attempt at being original and cutting edge but falling miserably short. The drinks were watered down and punchless, the mojito tasted like rancid dishwasher. I mean, come on: \"sparkling wine\" in a mojito? How about fresh mint muddled with premium limes and topped with good quality syrup and soda instead? Barbacoa broth and soggy, deep fried pork rinds (sadly called chicharrones) in a michelada? Who comes up with this stuff? So we tried draft beer. Can't go wrong with that right? Wrong! Negra Modelo was flat and smelled of dish soap. The keg was either way old, the lines dirty, or the CO2 pressure needed some tinkering. Food wasn't much better. Fish tacos were dry and tasteless. Al Pastor was way over salted and greasy. Tortillas were rubbery and cold. Tortilla chips were thick and tasted greasy, almost waxy - probably due to being fried in the lowest quality, lowest cost fats. Frijoles charros were so salty I felt my blood pressure rising with every bite. Overall, the food simply did not taste fresh and vibrant. It had that cut-rate, cooked in the cheapest vegetable oil by poorly trained, uninspired staff kind of feel and texture. I wish I could say something positive but this kind of slop should not be allowed in the food scene in Vegas. Charging people good money for this is borderline criminal. We have way too many outstanding food options in this town to tolerate this kind of stuff.",

    "text": "This review is based solely on the food. Service was 5 stars, but we probably got such great service because we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. I ordered the special Cuban Torta, meat was a bit on the skimpy side and flavor was very lacking. No salt or pepper on tables so we had to ask for it. Portion to price ratio is way off, ordered rice with my Torta and after 3-4 spoon fulls rice was done. To sum up this place I'd say it's best for drinks and appetizers.",

Any time you go into a place for the first time, there is a hesitancy simply because you don't know what attitude you will receive.  From the moment we walked in we were made to feel like friends. We have since been back 5 times with groups of friends.  Treatment was still the same.  Today I looked around and noticed there is hardly a piece of wood to be found.  It its all steel and glass, I mean huge panels of glass.  No matter where you sit you have a view of the outside, including the Strip.  The view has to be beautiful at night.  We are the city of lights, you know.   Every member of the staff is wonderful.  Diane and Nicole at the bar are the best. Julian is such a good manager I doubt anything or anyone could rattle his cage.  The food is killer.  I had a shrimp burrito with corn on the side.  OMG, I literally could live on that. Best guacamole and chips in town.     Friends are coming into town next week and wanted to spend a happy hour with us, since Bandito has one of the best happy hours. That's where we will be.   Of course you can confirm all this on Google, Face Book and Instagram.",

We got seated immediately and we're given our menus but we didn't see our server for nearly 30 minutes before getting our drink order. We also had to get another employee to bring us chips n salsa a because we were sitting there for at minimum 20 minutes before bringing that to us. The food was good no complaints there but we also asked the server to bring the Habanero sauce which he forgot and we didn't see him till the meal was almost over.  I really hate to give this place two stars as the food was ok but without service I don't feel right giving them any more stars. With such poor service, it's definitely not works going back and paying +$25 for food and drinks.  Could be a regular as I work in the Business complex but won't be back",

The quesadillas are the best I've ever had (and I've eaten a million of them in my life).  They mix carmelized onions with a really tasty red sauce.  The conqueso was extraordinary.

    "text": "Back again for an update- 8 months later.  The consistency in staff and detail is refreshing.  The food is still sublime and the Margaritas deserve your attention.  I highly encourage you to bring your friends to Banditos for a feast they won't soon forget.  However, after a few more of these freshly muddled cucumber mojitos I just might- yummmm!  Please disregard all low-star reviews- now I know the truth.  Banditos is not just a pretty building on the corner of Flamingo and Howard Hughes- it is the new standard for Mexican cuisine.  I've been all over the country- So Cal, Austin, Miami, New York, Chicago, you name it- nothing is really close to this quality and attention to detail.  The staff, the food, the music, the ambiance- all are remarkable.  Let me explain...  We opened the door and are immediately greeted in the most gracious of ways- I feel underdressed already.  We are then seated immediately and given a specials menu that is explained in detail. Shortly thereafter, we are introduced to our server- a lovely and knowledgeable lady who is ready with the best recommendations.  The drinks come and they are amazing.  I am not a big drinker, so I choose the \"special\" Agua Fresca and my lady chooses an incredible vodka drink that arrives in a copper pineapple.  Stunning presentation and the fresh fruit hint at what we can expect when the food comes.  Complimentary chips are delivered with two salsas- both amazing.  But, I choose the fresh guacamole dip.  The freshly made chips and the guac are an irresistible combination.  Before the end of the meal I had every drop of the guac.  The meals recommended were delectable.  I had the Sea Bass and she had the carne asada and habanero shrimp plate.  Fresh grilled vegetables adorn both meals and provide a colorful experience.  It all comes together in an explosion of flavor that has you wondering when the last time was that you ever ate any meal this good.  It's been a great great while for this guy- and that was a meat and potatoes plate.  We were constantly checked on by the most well-trained and courteous staff I can remember.  The owner checked in as well.  Our entire experience took less than an hour.  You will not be disappointed with this restaurant.  Put Banditos on your shortlist of restaurants you must visit.",

Little bursts of tastiness in your mouth. All of us had different types of tacos and everyone raved how good their food was. We also had a magician who came to the table and he was like whoa. Our heads are still reeling with the \"how'd he do that?\" We has a great experience and will be returning again soon!",

It's not one of the other million contrived, corporate stucco boxes like 90% of the places off of the strip. The floor to ceiling glass also makes for a nice view of the strip.   Service was great. Tony took excellent care of us. Very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive, but knew when to give us some space to relax. Also made a damn fine margarita!  Food was fresh and flavorful. Flautas are a must. Ordered an array of apps for happy hour. All of which were delicious. Chef even stopped by to check up on everything which was a great touch. That's when you know they genuinely care. Will certainly be back soon and highly recommend for locals and tourists alike.",

Our server was both host and server, and he was on it! He described dishes thoroughly and gave excellent recommendations. Our drinks were always filled and food came out hot. Excellent service! We started off with the octopus, super tender, great flavor, and just lightly fried. Must try! The margaritas were top notch. Strong, and very tasty. We had the house, and watermelon margaritas. The watermelon was by far my favorite. Not to sweet, but with a bang. For $5 you really cant go wrong.  Also the chango wango was delish. It was a tiki drink that was an outstanding pina colada! The tamale trio was superb. Seasoned, moist masa, filled to the brim with various fillings. My fave was the chicken tinga tamales with shredded  chicken and a bomb red sauce. Enchilida plate was great, pretty good size portion. I opted for the fried white fish, and chicken tinga. The protein was served on top. The green sauce put this dish over the top, as well as blood orange sauce. The pastor potatoes were amazing. Delicate potatoes cooked in like an Enchilada sauce, another must try. The steak was a large portion, very juicy and not overcooked. The Mexican corn was a great touch to the dish.  Ok now, the dessert-man oh man! Margarita cheesecake! Creamy cheesecake, topped with a bruleed pineapple, fruit salsa, and little crunchy mint pieces! Amazing layers of flavor and sweetness. Great food and excellent service will have me coming back here soon! Ps. I hope they bring back the avocado margarita so I can try!",

It's a little pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants, but you definitely get what you pay for.    The Watermelon Margarita comes highly recommended.   We started off with Asada Nachos. It was a great shareable portion. We also ordered the green chicken enchiladas, it comes with rice and beans and you get to choose a 3rd side. I picked the jalapeno and cheese tamale. My husband ordered the tacos de asadas, his also came with rice and beans and he chose the Mexican street corn on the side. We were blown away with how phenomenal the food was! It's so hard so find a good Mexican restaurant that has such an authentic taste.   Service was great. Our server was on his \"A\" game. Checked in on us frequently and made sure we were well taken care of.   We can't wait to come back again!",

    "text": "Bandito had a few flaws, but the excellent ambiance, food, and happy hour warrants them four stars.   My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday for happy hour. They seated us at a two person table which was fine, but the restaurant wasn't very busy and the table got pretty full after ordering 3-4 starters, chips, salsa, drinks, and the candle on the table. It took a little while for our server to greet us and she didn't mention happy hour until we did, but after that everything ran smoothly.   The $5 Bandito margaritas are a great price and strong. We got a free guacamole for checking in on Yelp (apparently there's a specific \"Yelp guacamole\". It looks small but tasted great and lasted surprisingly long. For starters we shared the ceviche, sopes sampler, and chicken tinga flautas. All starters are 1/2 off during appetizers so another steal. The sopes and the flautas were amazing, especially the flautas. They're like mini quesadillas wrapped up like egg rolls and stuffed with cheesy chicken. They serve it with a red enchilada sauce and another sauce I couldn't identify but both were really good.   The only dish I didn't care for much was the ceviche. I bit into what felt like glass, and while examining it the host came over and told me it was probably salt and took it away. The did have some big black pieces of salt on the dish, but the pieces I bit into were clear and had black markings on it so I don't know. I didn't want to eat any more of the ceviche just in case but I didn't care for it much to start with. It seemed overly fragrant, almost floral.   Overall Bandito is a solid solid spot for Happy Hour any day of the week. I will most definitely come back despite the few hiccups we experienced because it makes me feel fancy and the food and drinks were delicious.",

    "text": "Bandito is one of the most attractive Latin restaurants in Vegas with a great happy hour. They are A-Ok with me...  Bandito Service:  My first visit was for an early 6 PM dinner, party of 7 please.  I was the first to arrive, and they brought me to the table.  I was brought warm chips and salsa immediately, sweet.  Our server was extremely friendly and was so great with getting our last happy hour drinks and appetizer orders in before 6:30 PM.  Around 7:30 PM, a huge dinner rush came in, and we didn't see our server as much after the entrees were served.  He apologized and mentioned the dinner rush. He was trying his best, but it appears they were short staffed for the Friday dinner rush.  Bandito la comida: The $5 happy hour margaritas were tasty and made well. We hit happy hour and sampled the following appetizers.  Fried Octopus: Great red Bandito sauce and the octopus was cooked well.  The tamales in the Tamale Trio came out dry for us.  This took away the potential for their flavor, but the Jalapeno cheese was my favorite.  The Bandito Sope Sampler also came out dry and was very salty in taste.  I enjoyed the Chicken Quesadilla and the Turkey Chorizo Albondigas was hands down the best appetizer.  I'm definitely ordering the Albondigas again.  I had the Barbarcoa Tacos and they also came out salty and dry.  If I were to guess, the plates were probably left out under a heating lamp or on the counter too long before being served to us resulting in the unusual dryness of the plates.  Bandito Ambiance:  I LOVE the decor of Bandito, absolutely stunning and a lot of fun.  It's an industrial look with Contemporary Latin decor throughout the restaurant.  Numerous light bulbs hang that create this great look and the dios de los muertos mural is gorgeous.  Your social media fans will love your posts here. =)  I think I might have caught the Bandito crew on an off night and they still did A-OK in my book.  They started off strong and kind of faded in the end.  The 1/2 price Happy Hour and beautiful decor will definitely get me back to try more dishes, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for quite a while and after hearing pretty good things from my parents, decided to give it a try.  The menu is surprisingly small I thought but everything on it looked great! My girl and I sat down and were blown away by how creative and beautiful the restaurant is.  I love it honestly and couldn't stop looking around.    Chips and two salsas (red and green) were promptly served as well as a small plate of free guacamole (from checking in on Yelp).  We then ordered a bandito margarita, the sope sampler for appetizer and then the habanero shrimp with carne asada and the chicken tinga flautas (an appetizer but eaten as an entree) for entrees respectively.    Chips and salsas:  Good and the salsas had a different sweetness that I haven't had before.  Seemed out of place but I kept on chowing down. Guacamole:  Not the best I've had but fresh, well presented, and great for it being free. Sope sampler:  Came with two servings of each sope (barbacoa, carnitas, and vegetarian).  Barbacoa was delicious, carnitas was dry but had a good flavor, and the vegetarian was weird and did not belong. Habanero shrimp with carne asada:  The shrimp were very large and came with about five of them.  Very tasty, well cooked, and had a great sauce.  Carne asada (medium rare) was not medium rare, under-seasoned, and chewy.  These were on top of roasted vegetables which did not belong at all. Chicken tinga flautas: Only tried one bite and they seemed just alright to me. Bandito margarita:  Amazing!  Finally a place in town that knows how to make a proper margarita.  I love how they don't add sweet and sour.  That's a sin in the margarita world.  Still though, to add some sweetness, they added some agave nectar.  Pros:  Gorgeous interior, prompt and kind service, and great drinks. Cons:  Food was just average and was a it pricey.  I like that they include vegetarian options and vegetables in general but they didn't work at all.  I've never seen broccoli and cauliflower at any Mexican restaurant and I applaud Bandito for trying something new but it just did not work out.    I feel like if I come back it will be during happy hour, solely for the drinks and maybe try a few of their other offerings since the price will be better.",

Other than a half a dozen patrons, the crowd was not an issue. Service was very helpful, we were greeted and served by Heather. She gave us the specials for that evening and we took her recommendation for the street corn, which we dont regret. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas which were delicious and the shrimp were plentiful and not overcooked. We had the free chips and guacamole for checking in which was awesome. Guacamole was very good and creamy. The salsas were also very good one green which was a bit more tangy and the red was very mild. Chips were fresh and 3xtra crispy and hard to stay away from. Everything was well seasoned and delicious. My wife ordered the fish tacos served both grilled or battered and fried. My wife had the fried version. Nice flaky fish portions which extended beyond the tortillas. She paired it with extra lime and her go to, sour cream. Overall great dining experience. Caramel churros....oh my. Come try them.",

Subpar service, tasteless cold food, and an expensive menu to round up our experience really made this place, at best, mediocre. There's a myriad of Latin and Mexican food offerings scattered all over the strip and this is by far one of the less memorable places.   We started with a $12 plate of guacamole which was should be considered as a side. Bland. And you could tell that they've had problems justifying the price and size because they reinforced the item with \"free\" chips and dip. Secondly, we ordered the chicken fajitas as well as the chicken tinga flautas. The latter of the two were honestly the only memorable part of the meal. When we promptly asked for our check, our server yelled across the restaurant at the bartender for our bill. It was a semi-busy Saturday night but that was completely rude. Altogether, a $50 experience that made me only want to complain about it on Yelp the whole entire time.",

I was there on Tuesday the 23rd. My proof shows the 28th, due to that was the day the bank added the 30.00 TIP I gave your sucky staff for being rude which I regret tremendously.  Read it and weep. Your bartender looks just like that guy below my review, you know the one that argued with me for watering down the cloudy shot I ordered, and your a damn liar, because your BAR TENDERS were not women that day and you definitely weren't closed.

We also had the brick chicken(very delicious) and habanero shrimp(tasty).  The decor is splendid and truly a unique establishment in Las Vegas. There is nothing quite like it in our city.  The prices seemed reasonable and well worth it.  There was also a touring magician Seth Grabel on hand to offer fun magic tricks while you dine.  Highly recommend. Ill be back for those flautas!",

They offered us their \"hot habanero salsa\" in addition but we thought that is was the mildest of the three. Delicious, but mild. Maybe they're still working out the recipe.   We started with the ceviche appetizer! Very fresh and had a perfect dice to the ingredients to pair with their chips. We did add a little lime juice to it to up the tartness.  Hubby got the Carne Asada tacos and loved the fresh tortillas. He got roasted veg on the side and said they were slightly too crispy/fresh still and he would have preferred a little more \"roast\" to them but he ate them all anyway.   I had the Al Paster enchiladas with the Salsa Verde sauce and boy were those good. Lots of flavor in the sauces and I was swiping my rice and everything through my plate to get every drop.   We got two drinks: Change Wango and the El Guapo Margarita with Grand Marnier Caviar. Both were perfectly balanced. Yum! We will be back!  Thank you for having us!",

Interesting, creative, each product was of high quality , and the restaurant had a  great vibe. This was our first meal in Vegas. Wow, so good.",

We stayed for dinner with some friends and the service went down hill real quick.   We checked in on Yelp which they offer a free guacamole which the server refused to accept.  Told us that the free one was a small serving for only one person.  So we ended up buying the $12 guacamole which wasn't much bigger.  Total rip off!! Don't offer the check in if you aren't going to honor it.  The server was rude,  the food was expensive and not good at all.  We also ordered another round of drinks hoping for better but that was a disappointment too.  Definitely wouldn't recommend this place.  Much better options in the area.  Do yourself a favor and take your business somewhere else.",

I definitely will be back the next time I'm in town!!

Not only is the exterior beautifully designed, the interior is truly a sight to see as well. If you're a fan of margaritas, this is the place to be. They have a spectacular Taco Tuesday special that's great for unwinding after a long work day. I can't stop thinking about their Al Pastor tacos- they're that good. I suggest getting the fried Baja Fish; the grilled version is good too. I was also very pleased by their appetizers. The Queso Bandito was phenomenal. Tashalee was our incredible server the night I went, and she took great care of my friend and I. I recommend coming with an empty stomach, you won't regret it!",

The service we received from the server was stellar and I wish I could remember his name.   No pressure and good assistance with making selections.    TIP make sure to check in to get a free order of chips and guacamole.    I got a 3 taco order and it was amazing!! Good portion sizes with sides of rice and beans, it was filling for the price and i crushed it.   My wife got the carne asada salad and if you look at the pictures you can see how amazing the portion sizes are.  With a good sitting location my wife and I really enjoyed our experience ( no kids woo) and Bandito will definitely be a place to go when we makes our semi annual treks to the LV.     This is a  solid 4 stars plus a star for the amazing server ( I'm going to check my receipt for his name he was that good) and plus a star for the decor and experience.     This place is clearly getting attacked with fake reviews(accounts with no friends/reviews yet they write the Old Testament for a negative review), real Yelpers can see right through it.   If you come here expecting an 'authentic' Mexican food experience then that is on you , they never claimed to offer that   Just do your thing Bandito!!!!!!!",

Everything had absolutely no flavor, they charge you $13 for the smallest plate of guacamole I've ever seen in my life, and again NO FLAVOR! A little bit of salt could really go a long way.   We were given two different menus, and when we asked what the difference was the server had no idea and just said that we can order from either one, so when we were ready to order (which took our server about 30 minutes to come and finally take our order because he was too busy joking around with his coworkers behind the bar) he tells us we can't order from one menu because it's the lunch menu.... so we ended up ordering from the \"right\" menu and when we get our food it was just complete and utter disappointment. I believe I saw someone else leave a review and say that if you like authentic Mexican food do not come to this place and I just have to 100% back them up.   The only thing I can say was good about this place was my michilada.. but I've still had better.  It makes sense now why I've been getting Facebook messages almost once a week from this place pretty much begging me to come eat here and waste my money... it's really a shame cuz I wanted to like this place but everything from the food to the service was just awful.",

The food however, I thought was exactly like most Mexican restaurants.   Surely it was what I ordered, but it seemed just like any other taco shop. I went with Carnitas tacos ($18) which comes with three tacos, rice, and beans. Very good, but I'd rather spend half as much for something that tastes just as good and is a block from my house.  That being said, I owe it to Bandito for a second visit, thanks to the host on the way out. I forgot her name, but she sold me on the more unique side of the menu; like the octopus and the habanero shrimp. She even told me my tacos, I could have gotten a combination instead of all three being carnitas!  TL/DR: skip the tacos for something more unusual and come during HH",

I also had a $1 margarita for National Margarita day which was fine for $1, but I would not pay $9 for a regular glass of it (Bandito Margarita).   Would I go back? Yes. It would be a great spot off the strip for me and some friends to try.",

    "text": "So came to Bandito celebrate roommate graduation from UNLV. I was excited because the pictures seen both the food and the interior design looks amazing! The interior definitely lived up to the hype. The art mural as soon as walk in beautiful piece of artwork. I like the open space set up from the open kitchen, bar area is small but fan the way it set up in the middle of the restaurant, and there separate area for private party or large groups. Everything is very upscale and modern.  The food in my opinion never lived up to the pictures or hype. The Sandia Margarita was straight up legit! The most memorable taste of the night. Food went with the Grilled Chicken Tinga tacos. The presentation was solid and looked like legit street tacos. The flavors fell short. The chicken never had distinct flavor, the heirloom tomato is nice compliment, and tortilla fresh. All together nothing exciting or wow factor for me. The refried beans and rice. Plain Jane nothing exciting. Since more upscale the portion size are small.   The service was absolutely five stars. It was pretty big party think over 10 of us. She did amazing job! On top of everything the whole night!",

    "text": "Warning... this review is long... but read it...I don't do reviews often...unless I like a place that much I dont bother... my family owns a restaurant here in Vegas and overseas and I rarely like places enough to do reviews. Not saying that because I'm a food snob, but I know what it takes to put out quality food...Reviews can really sway your audience...but I had to say I will be back! Definitely worth the money. Very nice, clean, atmosphere and great service.   Starters: Chips and salsa are just great! Came with green and red salsa and warm, fresh chips with the perfect amount of salt. Check-in to get the free chips and guacamole too. The Guacamole is delicious! I should have ordered more before we left! We took the salsa and chips to go because they are that tasty... I couldn't bare to not finish them!  Cocktails: the Sandia was great! It's a watermelon margarita and it was perfect! Its sweet but not over bearing... fresh and delicious! I love the glassware too! Had a salt rim which paired perfectly with the sweetness. Try it!  ***I would come just for the chips, salsa, guacamole, and drinks if the food was so so but it is not so so at all.  Main Course: I had the beef enchiladas! Substituted black beans for the charro beans which were full of flavor (I am sure they are delicious too but I wanted to try them because I always get pinto beans). It came with fluffy mexican rice. Not everyone can cook rice... this was done the right way! The beef enchiladas were perfect... I would not change a thing and cannot find anything wrong at all... the meat was tender and seasoned perfectly... I am glad I had left overs because after this review... I'm making some eggs and eating it with it... just made a new meal Banditos... add it to the menu!!!   My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos. He also got black beans and Mexican rice. I tried a bite of the taco and man... it was bomb! He opted for the habanero sauce on the side... it is too hot for us but had great flavor and consistency... but the shrimp taco was so good, it didnt need the sauce... shrimp was buttery and juicy but seasoned well...all the toppings were fresh and balanced well with the shrimp.   Dessert: Not happening... we were too full to eat it... but now I definitely have to go back and try it if they have it.  They had a buy one get one entree on one of the social media sites...not sure which one... my boyfriend had it... he told me about this place and I'm so glad he did! It's definitely up there for me. Help this place survive! This place is great! It's a little off the strip...in Howard Hughes Center... I made a joke and said somebody's grandma is back there...just being silly... but for real... somebody's grandma is back there putting their heart and soul into every dish! Great job!",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to like this place...we came here last Saturday night for dinner pretty late for dinner around 9pm and the place was dead. This was good news for us because we were all starving! Immediately got seated and this was looking up but what happened was people who are working here standing round and not ensuring everyone was getting helped. The only people hustling here were our waiter which I think he had the whole restaurant and the bus boy. After an extended wait to order drinks and promised the best margarita we then began the other just trying to get drinks. This is Vegas Baby the last thing you want is for customers to be waiting for adult beverages. Our waiter came back and even apologized and said it was embarrassing we had to wait so long. he was right and appreciated him not making blame...well not the best margarita I have ever had but darn near. So now with a drink in hand and some appetizers on the table things were looking up.(Point needs to be made if you make an offer on Yelp for free chips and guacamole don't discourage customers from ordering it because its smaller than the normal portion).   Not so much now instead of just taking our order it was off to help others. After flagging him down now to place our order he goes over the specials which would've really nice to know based on the 30 mins + we were sitting here. Another annoying part here if your kids 15-18 and their friends don't talk them out of nachos if that's what they want regardless if they just had some chips and salsa. On to the ordering I had the 1/2 chicken and my wife and our friends had the shrimp special with carne asada. After now another 30 mins+ our waiter comes over while delivering other food and lets us know the computer malfunctioned and our order never transmitted...Hmm? Whatever at this point its now past 10p and everyone is just getting filled up on chips where they earned 1 star for me these were so tasty and the salsa was delicious both the red and green. Also forgot to add we ordered the fresh chicharrones and they were so fresh they were still popping in the basket and they were delicious another 1/2 star. What earned them the other 2.5 stars was the food. Everything after we finally ate was awesome. My chicken so perfectly cooked and very juicy. My wife's dish with the shrimp and steak was also amazing. My daughter said probably the best nachos she has ever had and her friend who is such a picky eater said the same. So well done on the food Bandito Kitchen! The decor and vibe of this place is also great and like i said really wanted to love this place but without the right service would not keep me rushing back. For a casual dinning experience off strip should not take nearly 2 hours to have dinner. You work on that and I will see about coming back because you guys have nailed all the other stuff.",

The menu is easy to read and surprisingly small.  I checked in Yelp to get Chips and salsas. I waited for it for a while. Finally, I waved at the waiter to get his attention. He said he forgot. Then he came back with the chips that includes red and green salsa. They were ok.  Friends ordered a bandito margarita, I think it was discounted. The waiter says Half Chicken $24 is his very favorite, so I went with it.  Food was just average and was a bit pricey.  I do love the decor!  I think if I come back it will be during happy hour.",

My friend and I arrived about 4:30pm and were seated immediately. There were only a few other diners there when we arrived but the pace picked up around 5.  I checked here on Yelp and got the free guac which came with chips and two different kinds of salsa. The chips were warm, thin, and fresh. Loved both of the salsas and the guacamole was delicious too.  My friend and I both ordered the chicken enchiladas but I got mine with the potatoes al pastor and the corn for an up-charge and She stuck with the beans and rice. The enchiladas are slightly different as the chicken was outside, not in them. But no matter, the chicken was cooked perfectly, was juicy and had a great flavor. I really loved the corn too, I'd definitely get that again. The potatoes were good, but didn't find anything too special about them, especially for a 3$ charge. My friend said her rice and beans were good.  Neither of us drank so can't comment on that. We were full so no desert either. Service was great. Our waters were refilled often and we were checked on frequently.  We both agreed we would definitively eat here again.",

Got our first round of cocktails and ordered a couple appetizers, sides and entrees. Food came out and everything was great, especially the side of Mexican corn and potatoes al pastor. During this time, our server never came back to check and see if we enjoyed the food or to ask if any of us wanted another round of cocktails but by the time anybody came to the table we were done with our food and it was still never offered.   We all currently work in the service industry, so after watching our server stand at the bar well and talk to his coworkers rather than coming over to be attentive to our table we were frustrated. At least 10 minutes passed after all plates were taken from our table, again our server is nowhere to be found and we weren't offered any dessert. To receive our check we had to get up and ask a bartender to print it for us. She ended up dropping our bill off, which was $300, our finally our server is there to take my card. Again, we work in the service industry and normally give 20% tip to any service we receive, but this guy just didn't care.   All in all, this rating is based solely on the service not the food.",

To start, I'm a sucker for a great bread, or in this case, chips and salsa. Bandito's doesn't disappoint. They offer two salsas - one green/tomatillo, the other red. We ordered guac and the tamale trio as our appetizers (the pork tamale was my favorite). I got the braised octopus tacos as my entree, hubby got the carne asada tacos. The octopus was perfectly cooked - tender and flavorful, but not overpowering. Just writing this review (a few days later) makes me want to go back, just for this dish!

This Mexican restaurant is fashionable, clean, comfortable, provides excellent friendly service and --- yes the food is great.  I went there with a party of five and everyone ordered something different.  From the appetizers, to the main courses and even recolonizing the birthday of one of our guests, we had a great time.  Parking - right by the entrance door.  Very easy, close and large parking lot.  The guacamole appetizer was very flavorful and was gobbled up pretty fast.  For an entree I had the Barbarcoa which was flavored just right and presented very well.  I highly recommend this location.  You're not rushed, you're treated like a valued customer, actually thanked, and treated to a truly nice environment.",

    "text": "So I really had to sit and think about this review a few days before writing it because I think this place has a lot of potential and with a few tweaks they can become a True go to spot for locals and tourist. I rated it 4 stars but it really would be about a 3.6 so I'll just give the benefit of the doubt and go back once more to see how I feel.  So to start it's located next to Sushi H20 In the Howard Hughes complex closest to flamingo street. It is a very clean restaurant with a nice classy/casual ambiance. It's not overly big but still big enough to host a big party which was what we had . The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating and that really helped me push my rating up. I could see this as a place to get a few drinks before a night out on the strip  Now onto the food- to start they prepare their food a little different which is a interesting concept , when you order a dish like enchiladas instead of the meat being cooked inside they place it on top which is something to get use to, also the presentation of all the food was amazing.I ordered the brick pressed toasted chicken and the best part of it was the mixed vegetables, the chicken was baked with skin and served with the skin and all the other fatty parts which is not my thing so I wouldn't order this again. I got to try the chicken quesadilla which was good the ceviche was so so and my buddy got the fish tacos which looked amazing and he said they tasted like they looked.   Knowing this place has half off happy hour and the tacos are 50% off I will be back only to try the fish tacos. Even though it's located behind the strip you will be paying strip prices so be prepared .",

    "text": "As a longtime resident of Texas and knowledgeable about Mexican food in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas takes a lot to impress me where Mexican food goes, however, THE BEST without question is Bandito Latin Kitchen and Cantina in Las Vegas.  A few blocks off the strip on Flamingo and Hughes Center.  Everything is prepared fresh when you order.  The guacamole was so fresh and creamy.  The flautas has a wrap that I swear was like a beef Wellington crust; light and flaky, melt in your mouth!!! The enchiladas were the same!  Choose from six different sauces (the Habanero Blood Orange was our favorite.  Chips and Salsa were also the best we've ever had!!! We will be back EVERY TIME we visit Vegas!!!!",

But the host encouraged us to come in and take our time ordering.  As soon as we sat down, we were served some delicious chips and salsa.  Our waiter \"Tony\" gave us some great recommendations.  The 3 of us split two entrees:  fish tacos and carne asada enchiladas with a tasty green sauce (sorry, I don't recall the sauce name).  The entrees came with 3 items per order and Tony had the entrees split on 3 plates for us.  What a nice extra touch.  It was a LOT of food, but we ate it all.  My favorite thing on the plate was their version of elote.  I would definitely come back here on my next trip to Vegas.",

Their food is great if you want someone to make your basic TexMex foods from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frecipes.com&s=f2df298b435c68316b69a8599c25dcc3a0dcbab688270d1f56195dbad941c67e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">recipes.com</a>. Otherwise there is no soul and inspiration to their food. Just what you can expect from downtown Portland or Seattle. The atmosphere is stereotypical and borderline offensive but I guess that is what is popular these days. The price is for the location not the food. But the chips and salsa are incredible which is why this is two starts. Save your self the tasteless trendy hipster experience and go to any other authentic TexMex place in Vegas. They're a dime a dozen one block up or down from here and are cheaper with better atmosphere.",

I got the carne asada tacos (sorry didn't take a picture but there's plenty on this yelp page lol) which came with rice, beans & a 3rd side of my choice which was the Mexican street corn which was pretty good as well! I give the carne asada tacos a 3.5/5. our servers name was Diane, she was so awesome, very patient, had a great attitude & also very personable. I would definitely eat here again! they've only been open for 4 months & it's going to be a nice addition to that area. I wish them the best of luck!",

    "text": "While I'm an advocate for more localized, authentic mexican cuisines, I will say that the gastronomic levels of their gourmet dishes can give El Dorado Cantina a run for their money.   I'm certainly glad that Howard Hughes picked up a restaurant that isn't a franchise restaurant.   CHECK IN OFFER/CHIPS & SALSA: Get that check in offer! Because we all know that we love a good guac thrown in the mix of salsa. Chips & salsa re-mix!!!! In all honesty, it's the green salsa that really out shined the guac. If you're a fan of extra citrus and lots and lots of cilantro. Go green!  OCTOPUS TACO: It came with rice and beans + a side, and the got the \"elote\" type corn. It was soft, tender, and packed with flavor. Of course, if you love that gamey, seafood flavor of an octopus, you'll like this. None of the fixings overpowered the octopus, because the octopus runs the show in this taco. I definitely recommend this if you're looking to be a little adventurous--steering away from the usual al pastors and carne asadas.   BANDITO HOUSE MICHELADA: Idk if they make their own chili powder for it, but that tajin is LIT! It is a lot spicier. They put two pieces of fried pork short ribs (chicharron style). Take a bite of that chicharron. Then, take a big sip of the Michelada with the Tajin spice and just wait until you feel your taste buds throw a fiesta in your mouth. You're welcome.   VENUE: It's definitely a good venue take your vendors, clients, or any business lunch/dinner for that matter. It's a great place to have a nice bougie dinner before the turn up with a big party. Date night? You betcha! it's cute, hip, and upscale for sure. The mural is also calls for a good photo opp or a 'gram.   SERVICE: Service was pretty slow during lunch, but we weren't in much of a rush and it wasn't very busy there either. However, the staff was super attentive with five different people checking in on us-- also with quite the sense of humor. So props to them.   Definitely worth a try and worth bookmarking for all you hip, out-of-town, foodies.",

Our server brought it out and immediately and knew it just tasted like over ripe, mashed avocados. When she came over to ask out was she already knew we didn't like it because she asked if we thought it was OK or if I needed more spices. Then when our entrees came out .... that's when the real disappointment began. So the elite/street corn tasted just like cold, soggy corn and sour cream. My tamales were made of some soft gross dough of some sort (not plantains?) and were served cold and flavorless. I told her to take them back immediately. Our nachos were extremely disappointing and were comparison to 7-Eleven nachos that were cold, barely drizzled with cheese and were cheap in every sense of the word.   Our quesadillas were fairly decent considering it's pretty hard to mess up cheese and chicken.   Additionally we asked for our first round of margaritas with a certain type of tequila (Herradura) and it was not clearly the brand we asked for. The next round of that same margarita were served with different drink accessories, for example my friend got a jalapeno on her same drink I ordered. Why?  Then when the The separate checks were delivered all the orders were put onto the wrong checks, and then when my friend received her check and put cash in for change, our waiter brought out her change with 20% taken out as a tip for herself already with no receipt!!! We called to complain but DAMN this was a terrible dinner. Awful.  We called and spoke to the manager about about my friend being shorted not provide a receipt, he did not care and we brought it up to him that he did not care he hung up on us. We work in the service industry and this is absolutely unacceptable. Beware of this place!!!",

Find it very odd that chips and salsa cost $, even at the most expensive restaurants they don't charge for chips. The food was good, but pricey, $21 for 3 tacos and a drop of rice and beans just isn't something I was too impressed with. Over $20 for a quesadilla and it doesn't come with anything, that's extreme! The street corn was actually very good flavor, they have it pre cut on a plate for you, it's rich, share it as a side with someone  Don't think i'll be back, good food, but they need better prices for the amount of food, and maybe some music make it more lively",

However, judging from your poor grammar I'm guessing you probably are not well educated or just a very sad person. Too bad for you your review was more telling on your character than sweet Jose's. Food was great, service was great. I recommend Bandito and ask for Jose!! Shannon Colle, Missouri",

Here is what was ordered:  Smoking Bandito - Pretty good flavor from the infusion with the adobada with a smokey, light chili savory taste to the sweet and sour from the lime and tequila.  Guacamole - Real fresh avocados with real good flavor...green salsa was fire with that garlic but the red was so so....  Queso Bandito - who doesn't like queso and chips...fire  Seafood Ceviche - Not the best ceviche i had....tasted and felt more like poke then ceviche  Chicharron & Arugula - One of those salads you can eat everyday and not get tired of it. It was spicy and salty from the pork belly chicharron...one of the highlights of this restaurant  Pulled Chicken Flautas - ehhhh...like my homies say \"there are better things on the menu\"  Tacos - Tried at least one of each...you can tell the freshness and quality of the ingredients with the Carnitas and Chicken Tinga my favorites....  Brick Pressed Roasted Chicken - the rice that it comes with for some reason was fire...so is the elote corn....chicken is good and is a solid dish.  Carne Asada & Chicken Tinga Enchiladas - Excellent and done well and the rice is fire.  Margartia Cheesecake - similar to a keylime cheesecake...  Overall this is a great addition to the Las Vegas scene and offers an excellent take on Mexican food in a trendy setting",

I think the food is probably good but we didn't get past the appetizer. To start there was no one at the hostess station when we came in so we had to wait several minutes.  Then when we got to our table we waited almost 10 minutes for our server, who was also apparently a bartender bc he was frequently caught up behind the bar making drinks. Which held him up frequently so the service ended up being horrible. After nearly 45 minutes for a round of drinks and an appetizer we decided to go somewhere else. Too bad because I liked the decor!",

Drinks also came 2 minutes before our food which I didn't like. Definitely would have tried another drink if it came sooner.    The panache or whatever were small. Almost a lunch portion but at $22 definitely not a lunch portion price.  The carne asada was maybe 4 ounces of steak and although cooked perfectly it wasn't worth the price, neither were the 4 shrimp that came with my friends order.  The vegetables were delicious however.  The habanaro salsa and sauce were tasty but not hot at all.    I realize the place is new but it still needs a lot of work. I will at least come back once in the next month to order what I originally wanted and see if the service and timing has improved.  The atmosphere is nice and it had potential but for the same price El Dorado kills this place.",

However the service is not great at all and the food is okay.  I went on a Friday night and it was empty in there except for a few people around the bar area. My boyfriend and I were seated at a huge table even though it was the two of us. Then our server only visited our table a total of 2 times (once to get our drink order and once to bring the check). We had random workers stop by to ask how things were and to bring out our food. They weren't very organized and every interaction was kind of awkward.  Although the service was not great, I believe that it could be fixed if the staff would have interacted with each other a little more and had a game plan for the few customers in the restaurant. They just seemed so unsure of themselves and we could pick up on it. Despite everything though, the chicken quesadillas were good.",

    "text": "Decided to go check this new place out for lunch a few days ago. My wife works in the Howard Hughes Center which is right next to Bandito's in this place has been much anticipated by people that work in that area.  It lived up to the hype in my opinion for sure!   I went with the burrito. Got shrimp and chicken, beans, rice, salsa, guacamole. The shrimp were huge inside. There probably weren't many of them (maybe 3 jumbo) but it gave it great crunch and nice added flavor in my opinion.   The guacamole was on the side and it was creamy. I generally prefer a little chunky guac but it was still very tasty and had grape tomato halves in it.   On top, I had the salsa rojo which is supposed to have a little kick but did not have much of one in my opinion. I generally like spicy but what it lacked in kick it carried in flavor.   The service was great. I realize that where new places often struggle is with their service. This was not the case at Bandito's. Our server was great, the other staff regularly filled my water. The manager came over to ask us how we were doing and then even removed some finished plates from the table.   The place is very nicely decorated. They have a beautiful mural on the wall! Some nice soft music and great ambience.   The burritos were about $18 a piece which is a little bit on the high side for a lunch outing but it's a nicer place so that's more accepted I guess.   Give it a shot, I'll certainly be back!",

But the food- it was so much better than the \"Mexican food\" with which I am familiar. It was more flavorful and absolutely delicious-everything was really good!  More 'latin' than 'Mexican'.  Fresher.  Not greasy.  First visit yesterday. It was happy hour and the appetizers were 1/2 off.  Good deal at apps $5 ea.  Within the hour a wonderful Spanish Guitarist entertained- that was great!  Started with the guacamole and chips, chicken quesadilla (a must!!) and queso with slivers of red and yellow peppers- served with small tortillas.  All great.  I was full - but continued on to an entire. I had carne asada enchiladas. Served with just enough rice and (whole) beans and vegetables. Each bite was interesting-great flavor-spice heat level is a self regulated style. Sauces are served on the side. Jose, our waiter, was super. Informative and upbeat-didn't oversell but his suggestions were True to description. I will go back and take friends. Highly recommended!",

They really know how to treat their guests!  From speaking with Jessica over  the phone (so seamless and professional), to meeting Jake (amazing manager) and then having Tony (waiter/bartender/go to guy)- I couldn't of asked for a better night!  We did the pre-fix $55 menu (enough food to feed a small army) and the open bar package ($40 for 2 hours) was TOTALLY worth it. We never had an empty drink or wanted for anything. They really know how to treat their customers.  The food was amazing. Guacamole was so fresh and the salsas were divine! Highly recommend the octopus as well as the ceviche. Both very fresh. Most of my group ordered the habanero shrimp and steak. The steak melted like butter in your mouth and the shrimp were large and tender (although VERY SPICY- would suggest possibly ordering sauce on the side if that's not your thing).  Fantastic tequila selection and Enrique makes a wonderful drink as does Tony! They have top shelf liquor and service.  Can't say enough great things about this place. Great prices for GREAT food. It is TOTALLY worth going and I doubt you will be disappointed.",

    "text": "I feel bad leaving a one star review but we had a very unpleasant time at this restaurant this week. I suggest going elsewhere! Cool decor; however service and food quality were awful.  We are local and live very close to this restaurant so we were very excited to give a new neighborhood restaurant a try. The design of the restaurant is stunning! But that's all I have for a positive note.  We went to the restaurant this week on a weekday and the restaurant was not busy, mostly open tables. We walk in and hostess is just starring at us, no greeting. Then waiter doesn't greet us for quite awhile once seated, when he does, he says he will be back and he has another assistant server helping him. The second server comes no greeting just places water and chips and salsa. The salsa was actually awesome! The waiter took at least another ten minutes to return then takes order, I got a beer, I kid you not it took 30 minutes to get a beer, and I was watching the bartenders doing side jobs and relaxing, um can I pour my own beer at this point? Server just kept coming to the table saying your beer will be right out...the whole time this is happening I am watching the hostess walk back and forth through the restaurant space eating chips....back and forth eating chips in the middle of the restaurant! The manager is just walking in circles doing nothing, when all guests around us looked irritated with the experience.  Ok fine, maybe I can ignore all of these service issues and the food will be fine. Food comes, I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos, he ordered the Al Pastor Tacos. My tacos were so over cooked they tasted more like chicken strips than fish. No flavor on either taco just bland cheap ingredients, not even plated well. When we are paying $21 for a plate of 3 tacos with one bite of beans, rice and corn on the side you expect it to be at least semi flavorful.   Too expensive, poor service, horrible food quality.  I will not be visiting this establishment again and I hate to have to say it but I would suggest you don't either :/.  So many other decent restaurant options close by, not worth it to go here. Sorry.",

    "text": "I'm very disappointed with this restaurant. I called to make a reservation and when we arrived, there was no table available.  We were seated by the bar, and changed to a table after we ordered the drinks. Our waitress messed our orders; she forgot to place half of the order, and she brought an appetizer to our table. The food took a long time to arrive. One of our friends had ordered black bean instead of the beans with pork, and her order did not arrive as she had asked.  The waiter stated that she would bring the black beans, but she never did.  At the end, my friend asked to have the black beans to go.  I read all of the review prior to making the reservation, and I had high expectations for this restaurant.  The food was very good and the appetizers were a must; however, customer services must be a priority for this restaurant. The waitress seemed to be annoyed with us and barely came to our table.",

My go-to favorite in LV for this type of food is Border Grill, but I think Bandito brings a little more to the table!  Their drinks are gorgeous, the flavors are authentic as can be while still maintaining a high end appearance/presentation, and all this for less than strip prices.  I've only been here a couple times for Lunch, but need to check back in for dinner.  with the cool lighting and layout i'm sure it's probably even better at night.  Now after reliving this i need a margarita and some carnitas - oh well, it's not new years resolution time just yet!",

    "text": "I heard a lot about this place and I decided to check it out yesterday for taco Tuesday. I usually go to borracha but I wanted to try somewhere different, upon arrival I found the decor to be awesome ! I loved the octopus tacos I enjoyed everything we tried but this tacos stood out and were my favorite! I appreciate the presentation and elegance that Bandito puts into their food. Service was a little slow and somewhat unfriendly and then around 9pm  they began a after party I guess but the DJ was more annoying than anything. It got too loud and the music being played ruined my experience. The place was pretty empty so I don't get the loud DJ music? The men smoking hookah outside bothering every girl that walked by made for an uncomfortable feeling. I wanted to enjoy food and drinks at a restaurant if I want to hear a DJ and be harassed I'll go to a nightclub! I don't get that whole concept. Overall I give the decor a 5 star , food a 4.5 star and service a 3 star. I thought it was a cool place I would have stayed longer and spent more money but the \"after party\" made me reconsider. I will go back for the food but I'll do it before 9pm.  Kudos to the Chef I hope they stick to being a restaurant with good food and not so much a party place because this is a place that is enjoyable for business types after work.",

The ceviche wasnt that great, felt like it needed more citrus and there wasnt much flavor or juice. Also it doesn't come with chips but we used the chips that came with the salsa for it. But the chicken tinga enchiladas were great. The tacos came with so much protein, thought it was excellent value. Churros were delicious. Micheladas are good. House Sandia margarita was a bit too sweet. Overall a good experience and hope they keep improving. Would definitely be back for happy hour!!!",

The decor, artwork, and color scheme of the restaurant is visually pleasing.  We ordered the tacos al pastor and grilled Baja fish tacos.  Both came with achiote rice and beans plus a third side item.  We chose potatoes al pastor and roasted vegetables for the extra sides.  All of the food was freshly prepared and elegantly presented not to mention delicious. This is definitely authentic Latin American food with an emphasis on quality ingredients at an affordable price.  We must give special thanks to our waiter Carlos Villanueva who provided top notch customer service and attended to all of our needs.  Also, thank you to Kabari (not sure if I've spelled her name correctly). She also greeted us, checked in on how we were doing, and when we were getting our to-go box ensured we had more fresh chips and salsa for later.  We highly recommend you go visit Bandito Latin Kitchen - for the excellent cuisine and the kindness and hospitality of the staff!  We will definitely be back soon!",

We ordered guacamole which was awesome and you don't really need it because they will keep bringing chips and salsa for the table which is awesome on its own.  I had the carnitas enchiladas with Creamed Salsa Verde and they were delicious. They were different than normal enchiladas because the meat was on top but I loved that because I ended up eating more meat and less of the cheese.  My husband had a special which was the Cubano torta which was like a Cuban sandwich and he loved his as well. Our friends loved their food too and there was more than enough for all of us!  The service was great we dealt with the bartender, manager and server and they were all helpful, friendly and welcoming which can be difficult to find in Vegas. We will definitely go back!",

In my opinion that says a lot about a restaurant.   Staff: Phenomenal, everyone is so friendly and helpful starting from the manager to host to kitchen staff. You guys are awesome.   I recommend this place to anyone that has seen them. You must try it. Don't miss out",

I will be back for taco tuesday.This was the perfect way to end the work day. We sat in the bar and Nikki ,our bartender, was delightful.

The atmosphere is modern with a spectacular insight of Latin American culture. It was nice to step out from the loud crowd of The Strip and enjoy a peaceful dinner.  The food was delicious with True Latin flavors with a twist. We tried the guacamole, the carne asada and chicken tacos. They were soooo tasty along with the street corn on the side. Yummy! The Aguas Frescas are a must to try. They are flavorful and refreshing.  This whole experience couldn't be possible without the spectacular service we received. Our waiter, Jacob, was so knowledgeable and gave amazing recommendations like the dessert.   I can't wait to visit again and try the rest of the menu.",

We went on a Monday to take advantage of the drink specials, and omg were they delicious. For starters  we got the guacamole, queso Bandito, fried octopus and the chicken tortilla soup- all were amazing!!! Seriously, so good. As my entree I got the beef enchiladas and they were so good. The service was incredible, I believe his name was Jared- he took such great care of us, and was on it. We literally didn't have to ask for anything.

We made it in for happy hour and we both found it so awesome they allow you to still participate sitting at a table. In NYC, most places make you sit at the bar in order to participate in happy hour. The waiter was so nice in alerting us about the happy hour options--which are all phenomenal and very generous--as well as coming back to our table towards the end of happy hour to see if we wanted to order anything else before it ended. We found that very kind and we sure did order more! The food itself was incredible and very unique. And holy moly order the guac. The decor was also really nice and was a nice balance between upscale but comfortable. I must also add that whoever the gentleman who was the host the night we were in was so friendly and made us feel so welcome. What a great way to start off our vacation.",

Let me tell you the fish tacos had no taste to them and the flavor was very bland. The platters where extremely hot but the food was cold. The prices of their menu was way to high for what you get. Side dishes are very small. They definitely need more selection of fish entrees with larger portions if they went more future business.

    "text": "I tried to redeem an offer for a buy one get one entree. I was told I couldn't use it due to it being Taco Tuesday. My date ordered tacos, I didn't. Also, upon entering the restaurant we weren't greeted in a timely manner. Instead we were stared at by two people who chatted amongst themselves. One of who ended up being our waitress, when being seated we were rudely notified that the restaurant was closing soon but they'd go ahead and seat us anyway. Well, wasn't that nice of her?! As she took our order, she had the nerve to sit at our table. Like she was a guest. Not something to be done with first time customers. At that moment I asked my boyfriend if he'd like to dine elsewhere since I was put off by the welcome we'd received. I saw this place on the Travel Network and was excited to try it because I live next door and was hoping it would a regular place for me to dine. That will no longer be the case. The first impression left a bad taste in my mouth. The food is mediocre at best and the service was completely unprofessional and rude. I notified the restaurant through FB messenger of my experience, after I kept getting notifications to redeem other offers. At first they appeared to try to fix the unpleasant situation by stating they'd like to make it up to me. A few weeks go by and nothing. Again, I kept receiving offers and decided to opt out of the subscription. I spoke with a person during this message who promised to forward my complaint to the right person. I've yet to hear from that person. Instead I've been blocked from commenting or messaging the restaurant. Very disappointing overall. There are better restaurants surrounding Howard Hughes Center. I'll stick to those. Teach your staff professionalism and manners. The Black tall waitress with the shaved head should be first in line for that training. She most certainly did not deserve the 20% tip I left for her.",

Mind you we were watching our server standing in the bar area looking like he was wigging out. We tried calling the other servers but, only one at the end of our meal was the best server we had. We wanted to sit outside and we were placed at a wobbly table, they said the would come and fix it. Next someone shut the lights out while eating dinner.  Now our food....we had tacos, in an oil bath. These servers with an exception of one, still received his tip. We actually told him to keep all of it but he had integrity and gave it to the others who didnt deserve any.",

They have a nice selection of draft beers and house wines available for 5$ but the two margarita selections and sangria are where it's at!!! The sangria is red ( white also available ) all margaritas and sangrias are made to order and made with various selections of fresh fruit and juices and each is really a delight to the palette and strong !! All for 5 bucks!! Next the food , we were served complimentary chips and salsas a red and green and both pack the perfect amount of heat !  All the appetizers are half off and there are no bad choices ! The queso fundido is served hot and bubbly and quite frankly the tastiest I've ever eaten  The chicken flautas were crispy and filled with a delicate and flavorful mix of chicken and cheese  The ceviche from what I hear is very tasty and a great mix of complimentary seafood  The tamales each more flavorful than the last  The SOPE sampler , I could not believe for as small as they were each packed a lot of flavor and my friend agrees that even tho the carnitas and beef Barbacoa were great the veggie one was a surprise and the veggie mix did not leave you wanting !!  Also while it lasts don't forget to check it for your free guacamole , although small it's packed with flavor and beautiful presentation and FREE with check in !!  Also I e tried the churro dessert but it was passable a little to doughy or undercooked I could not figure out which  also the street corn as a side is a wonderful accompaniment , it's creamy and cheesey and bursting with fresh off the Cobb flavor  All in all my experience here will keep me coming back and be my go to for happy hour!!",

    "text": "I was all around pretty disappointed in Bandito.  We came with a group for a birthday and I will say the place is gorgeous.  But both service and food were subpar.  Our server was super inattentive.  Aside from being slow to come take drink orders, check in, etc, he seemed confused by the menu.  There was more than one occasion we ordered things directly by name from the menu and he was confused by what we were talking about.  We also had to ask multiple times for certain things.  As far as drinks go, we were kinda \"meh\" about our selections.  I had the jalapeno elderflower margarita and it wasn't bad by any means, but it definitely didn't have a kick to it.  There was a spear with 2 jalapenos in the drink and that may have been the only spice which didn't give it much before I kind of muddled them in.  A friend had a michelada and thought it was just straight up bad.  I tried the Smokey margarita and personally wasn't impressed but friends did like that one.  As for food, again, meh.  The guacamole, while not bad, wasn't anything spectacular.  A bit bland for me and for the price, it was also a very small portion.  You pay for chips and salsa here and they were good.  I had the shrimp enchiladas and did not care for them.  The habanero blood orange sauce was too sweet for my liking, so maybe just a poor menu choice by me.  A friend had tacos and the tortillas were legit cold and did not seem fresh.  He ate the insides and didn't even bother with the tortillas.  Overall I'd give a 2.5 if I could, but bumped it down to 2 with no desire to try the place out again.  There are much better options in Vegas.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I have spend a lot of time in Vegas, and I have eaten in many restaurants in this town. I rarely give 5 star ratings because I believe it has to be extraordinary to merit this rating. My experience at Bandito tonight warrants this rating, across the board.   Firstly, I was initially impressed by the exterior and interior design of the restaurant. It is open, airy, modern, and the (open) kitchen and restaurant is immaculate, which goes a long way for me. You feel relaxed and comfortable here.   I was very impressed by the creative and unique menu, which captured all you expect in Mexican food, but adds a creative spin, such as al pastor potatoes. The food was fresh, incredibly tasty, and it was plated and presented extremely well. The portion was also perfect, and unlike most Mexican restaurants which dump as huge heaping portion on the plate, this was well balanced and thought out. My dinner (Carne Asada tacos) and drink (Barbacoa michelada) were delicious and well prepared.   Finally...and certainly not least, the service was impeccable. This tells you so much, and our server Jose was professional, knowledgeable, and Personable. He took the time time to tell us about his favorite foods, and his own experiences growing up in Mexico City. He was friendly, and made us feel welcome. That meant a lot to me.   I was so impressed with this restaurant, and I will absolutely be back to try more of this delectable menu. Certainly a hidden gem in Vegas, and worth going off the strip to try!",

My buddy ordered the short rib enchilada's which he said were good and I ordered their seared New York steak and it was terrible. If your not going to buy high grade steak at least season or marinade it to give it some flavor. I took two bites and was disgusted. No flavor whatsoever bland, blah. So when the waiter comes by and ask us how is everything and I tell him no good and he just walks off not asking me why or if there was anything he could do not even a discount on the bill while he stands around in an empty restaurant playing with his cell phone. Worst steak I ever tried and a total disregard for an unhappy customer will not come back.",

Customer Service: The host upfront was great about seating us 30 minutes before our reservation for happy hour and our waitress was very friendly and responsive to our needs.  Food: This is where we were disappointed. Everything was just meh. We ordered the nachos which were very difficult to eat because of the plate and they way they were stacked. There was next to no cheese and cold beans all over the top.   We thought it was just a fluke because the chips and salsa were so good. So we tried ordering the fried octopus, but unfortunately, they had already removed it from the menu. We then ordered the turkey meatballs, ceviche and sope sampler.   The meatballs were okay, they were well seasoned, but everyone at our table just at one and left the rest. The sope sampler was probably the best out of the three, but still nothing that amazing. But the worst was the ceviche, the shrimp was still gray and there was no flavor whatsoever. We actually sent the ceviche back because we didn't want to risk food poisoning.   Our waitress was so friendly, and she even told us they were still working out some of the kinks on the menu.  Just based off our experiance, I don't think we will be coming back. The food was just overall underwhelming and the enviroment just wasn't dazzling enough to bring us back.",

It is a little pricier than other Mexican restaurants and menu items are pretty typical. The tamale plate was ok kinda tasted like store bought tamales you could probably get at Cardenas. The guacamole was good tasted fresh and chunky which is how I like it. The chips and salsa was nothing special. The Chango Wango cocktail was filled with way too much alcohol I didn't even finish it. The barbacoa michelda was interesting. Tasted liked a typical michelda with a saltier taste and it was topped with pieces of barbacoa which was pretty good actually. Probably won't be back here.",

Very nice place with a cool vibe, the bar looked inviting with a great selection of tequila on the back bar. We ordered the sope sampler and could see the chef carefully putting it together, but overall it wasn't anything special. Carnitas lacked any authentic flavor and the rest was just there with nothing to write home about. I also tried the agua frescas with watermelon and mint, but it must have just been made because it was still at room temperature. I put some ice in from my water and it helped a bit. Also we were informed that they didn't have octopus for one of our taco orders, so two fish taco plates were the lunch of the afternoon. Again, no flavor in the fish and kind of dry, the corn tortillas were cold and tastes like out of a package. Even places like Cafe Rio can do better.  In general the flavors were barely making it, no cilantro, no Mexican cheese, no onions... The place has potential, but kick up the flavors of the food to an authentic Mexican level please.",

Then it gets worse. For a place that only offered salads, a few entrees and tacos they could put more effort into the tacos. The lunch entree comes with two tacos - but they are street taco size. And terrible. The carnitas & barbacoa were so fatty you couldn't eat them. So disappointing. The rice and beans were dry and flavorless. Very nice ambiance and great staff but the food is simply not worth it.",

Ordered drinks and they were out of items to make the Sandia Margarita. Server suggested we watermelon with tequila so we tried it. It was ok,but nothing to write home about. Then ordered a few appetizers for the table. Queso - it came with caramelize onions and peppers. Was really looking forward to tasting it, but was very disappointed as it was lacking flavor. I'm hoping they tweak the recipe as it has potential but needs some flavor.  Turkey albondigas- these were tasty and would suggest you order. Trio tamales were a good choice in order to get a taste and all three beef, chicken and cheese . They were  ok tasting. A little on the under filled side. The Fried octopus had a a lot of flavor. It was served with fried cauliflower however the dish had more fried cauliflower than octopus.  Chips were ok but the salsa was delicious. Especially the red!  Had the chicken tinga enchilas with achiote chile and also cream green sauce both were good. The enchiladas were different and it definitely was not the original chicken tinga. Instead it was a large piece of chicken on top of cheese enchiladas. Side were adobada potatoes which were just ok.  Rice which was a little undercooked but good flavored  and frijoles charros were ok .   Overall this dish was good, but could use improvement.  Friends had carnitas Tacos which were good and the tortilla soup.  Both were good and worthy of ordering again.  Overall it was good food,but they do need somebody tasting dishes before they come out for flavor. The room decor itself was very nice and different and service was actually very good. They have an outside patio.   It was their first Sunday open so hoping dishes will develop as they get established and look forward to trying this place out again in the near future.",

Upon being seated, I started out with the Bandito margarita, which was delicious, not too sweat and well balanced. We had the ceviche for an appetizer which was great, the fish and shrimp were well seasoned and firm in texture (not mushy).  For our entree's I had three of their tacos, octopus, barbarcoa and al pastor, and all were spot on. The octopus was perfectly cooked, the barbarboa was like the perfect mexican pot roast and the al pastor was amazing with charred pineapple.   For my side dish I chose the off the cob Mexican street corn, which was amazing.  My wife had the baseball cut sirloin, and it came out perfectly cooked paired with al pastor roasted potatoes.  In the end we could't have been happier with our meal.  Also a special shout out to our server Jared who delivered outstanding service at every point throughout the meal.",

I'll absolutely come back here as long as they keep up on the quality. This place is 100 times better then border grill on the strip.

The service is a big miss and I believe with some additional training they will get focused and execute better. I will return as the food is good and I believe that more time training will equal better results on the service end.",

    "text": "We attended a charity event for Ronald McDonald House at this restaurant last night, and were so happy we did!  Our server Tony, was fabulous, the food was excellent-chips and salsa-authentic with a little kick; Planchas (fajitas) added steak and shrimp-phenomenal! We have never had fajitas with such a wide variety of vegetables-broccoli, cauliflower, carrots!  They have a variety of sauces and sides to choose from in combination with your entree and the portions were perfect! Monica, the manager came over and introduced herself, and made sure everything was to our liking.  I tried a great drink, Chango Wango, a sweet drink made with vodka (ok might have tried more than one since hubby drank water), again it wasn't huge with just the right amount of juice.  Since this was our first time here, we decided to try a dessert, ok maybe two - churros and the brownie.  WOW!  They were both fantastic and the best part, they were not heavy, we were so glad we walked away from the meal feeling comfortable rather than miserable.   We were very pleased with the atmosphere-decor is open and modern, the staff-excellent customer service and food-finally found a great chips and salsa place!  We will definitely be returning to check out the lunch menu as well as Happy Hour!  Thanks to the owner as well for supporting a local non-profit! Definitely a win-win evening for us;)  We definitely recommend and will be bringing all of our Alaskan friends to this place!!",

    "text": "Just outstanding.  I am a local, I've been here 3 times so far with 3 different sets of friends, and everyone so far is just really impressed. (Including tonight) Honestly, I'm a lazy Yelper. There, I said it. So.....I haven't reviewed before now, because I honestly believed this place would have so many 5 star reviews, that mine wouldn't matter. I was actually shocked to see this place clicking in at a 4. So I started reading them. It seems the prevailing sentiment in any of the poorer reviews, is that it wasn't \"Mexican\" enough. Not to be preachy here, but it's billed as a Latin Kitchen. Is Mexico part Latin America?  Sure. Is Columbia? Brazil? Guatemala? Chile? Venezuela? Peru? Cuba? Haiti? (I digress) Yes to all of the above, and many more. So if you think it's not Mexican enough, perhaps you should learn a little geography, and maybe just go to a Mexican restaurant. But if you want SO much more than that, then cast aside the burrito, and take a chance on this place. You can really tell a LOT of passion went into the melding of flavors, to deliver a menu that they are clearly, (and rightfully so), very proud of. The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and preparations, and can talk freely  and fluently about any menu item. They are professional, courteous, and attentive, almost bordering on too attentive, which isn't a bad thing. The drink menu is cutting edge, the Habanero Shrimp is divine, (had that tonight) the Barbacoa is outstanding, I could go on and on. Each of my 3 times here, I've had 3 different dishes, and sampled my guest's choices as well, and never had a b-level menu item. I could go on, but I think I've made my point. If you want a cheap burrito, go to Roberto's. (Which is also delicious) If you want a truly next-level culinary experience, with Mexican influence and SOOO much more, give this place a try. I am sold.",
