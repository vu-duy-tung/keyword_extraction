I got the Bun Bo Hue and my bf got the Oxtail Pho Soup.  The Bun Bo Hue was decent, but my once piece of tiny pork hock was not tender, and unfortunately, that is my favorite part about eating this soup.  The noodles were very short too.    The Oxtail Pho soup was decent as well.  The star anise flavor was very overpowering.  The service was good.  For now, it's an A-Ok.",

    "text": "My new favoritest place to eat!!!  Because, because, be-caaaauuuse.... because of the wonderful things and phos.  The very best bun bo hue in all the land.  I could probably eat this dish almost daily and never tire of the rich, bursting flavorful goodness that delights my tongue with magical flavor tingles.  The wonton noodle soup is my second favorite dish here.  I didn't really have an opinion on the pho, as I've only had it once and remember it being good.    The staff is super cool and nice.  On my first visit the main guy in charge noticed my stiff shoulders and arms folded across my belly in an attempt to conserve my body heat and he immediately rushed to turn off the fans near my table.  On my second visit I totally butchered the pronunciation of bun bo hue, to which my waitress ever so politely corrected and assured me that it happened all of the time.  It probably doesn't, but I appreciated the fact that she was so nice about it.  Also, by the way, this particular visit was when my love affair with bun bo hue started.  I've had it many other places, but never quite this delicious and tasty.    The place is very clean and inviting, decorated with tasteful individual pictures of featured dishes above each table - not overdone and not like the Chinese take-out restaurants that have a wall of pictures of every dish offered with half the names misperred.  At first I thought the name to be somewhat of a contradiction, as Asian food and the imagery associated with \"bistro\" don't seem to jive.  But after dining there a few times, I realize that it works.  The space is fairly small and intimate, with approximately 10-15 tables.  Parking can sometimes be tricky if you try to visit on a week day around lunch time as it's located in a strip center that houses a variety of popular lunch spots.  Any other times, parking is a breeze.  Love, love, loooooove this place.  Go get yourself some of their delisherous bun bo hue NOW!",

I understand it is not the restaurant's fault, but it doesn't change the fact that it is unpleasant.  It is fairly spacious inside with a very standard, devoid of personality type decor. The service can be hit or miss, but even on the \"hit\" day it's the bare minimum consisting of a water refill.  The pho is actually good. The broth is flavorful and they do not skimp on the meat. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity of food that you get. On my last few visits I had their vermicelli with grilled pork and pork paste. The taste is ok and they do skimp on the meat. I ordered an extra side of grilled pork for my husband and I to share just because the few pieces that come standard get lost in the mix quickly. I still prefer the pho and vermicelli at Pho Saigon 8 on Eastern and 215, but this one is considerably closer to my house.",

Stains, food, spills on the walls, the ice machine looks like it was on its last leg and filthy, the cashier/waitress kept wiping her nose on the back of her hand, cleaning products around the fountain drink station, dust hanging from the ceiling grill, must I go on.

Their pho is delicious! :O A lot of places have gone cheap on the broth so it just taste like water, but this place..so good. I'm sad that I didn't get the pho in the first place!

I ordered a Thai tea and never got it. Very expensive for the quality of the soup and service. Staff seemed unable to really handle the restaurant when it was busy.

I often judge a place by the freshness of the ingredients they bring out with the pho - sprouts, herbs and jalapenos. They were great and very fresh.  The service was good and the man that brought the food out from the kitchen was so differential about it that you felt like you were about to embark onto a special journey upon receiving your meal. Service was good for a pho house (generally service at any pho place has a lower standard of service then other locals).",

    "text": "Half of my week is spent working in Summerlin, and the Vietnamese options are slim pickings, but this is my go to spot when the craving arises during my work lunch hour.  For quality of the pho, I would rate them around 3.5 stars since the stock is a bit on the sweeter side and not as complex but a step above msg stock from a packet of powder, and there does appear to be a markup of $1-2 from similar entrees in Chinatown.  I completely agree with other reviews regarding their Bun Bo Hue since it's a bit toned down for less adventurous palates (not inherently spicy, but using their housemade chili sauce really elevates the dish) and there is a lack of the blood-cake and random pork parts (pork hock included only by request) that make this dish unique.   I know that some folks may make a general rating based on traditional items such as pho and banh mi, but I think the True gems on this menu lie a little off the beaten path.  The shrimp paste spring rolls are tightly wrapped like cuban cigars and have a nice ratio of meat and vermicelli/vegetables with the rice skin having a nice toothsome texture.  They also have some other intriguing items in the appetizer section such as a deep fried savory vietnamese crepe, carpaccio salad, and other items that I am excited to try.  One dish in particular was recommended by the manager on my most recent visit : the shrimp and crab udon soup (banh canh cua).     I was a bit skeptical since I expected some half Vietnamese/Japanese concoction with imitation crab and overcooked shrimp in a bland clear broth, but what arrived was an unexpected deluge of flavor that blew me away!    The broth is thick and  starchy like a good hot and sour soup with bits of real crab meat bathing unctuous udon noodles made with tapioca flour (not to be confused with the Japanese variety) that had a hybrid texture between italian bucatini and Korean dukbokki.  The manager strongly recommended adding a generous sprinkle of black pepper and I wanted to increase the heat with a dollop of the chili paste so I applied both.  I'm usually a fairly adventurous eater that likes to constantly try new things on a menu, but this was one of those dishes where I seriously contemplated never ordering anything else again because I didn't want to deal with the regret of ordering an inferior dish.  The noodles/broth ratio was great since I still had noodles down to my last bite and the thick broth is perfect to coat the udon with layers of umami since the noodle isn't capable of absorbing much flavor.  The only weak spot was the shrimp since they were indeed a tad overcooked and lacked the sweetness and snap of the recently caught variety.  Definitely earns a spot amongst my top 10 vietnamese soups in Las Vegas.",

If you haven't read My T. or Paolo D review of this place yet, do so.  I used it for my analysis and visit and I was happy!  2.  Parking - strip mall, very easy.  Odd that it is near a cigar bar, which has a very distinct cigar aroma, however, once inside the restaurant, you cannot smell the cigars.  3.  Ambiance - Small narrow place, with purple walls. Nice overall.  Small and cozy. Nothing fancy.  4.  Drinks - I always prefer fountain drinks and they do have this over the canned sodas, so definitely a plus.  5.  Food - Ahhh,  I tried the Bun Bo Hue based on MyT an Paolo D review an it was great. It was not too spicy at all, and in fact, was very subtle.  This is great as it is not too overpowering and you can always add more spices or the jalepenos.  The noodles were just right in terms of texture and firmness.  The serving size was just right and this is the first time that I drank so much of the broth. It was very, very tasty.  My son had P11 and he enjoyed it as well as with an Iced Coffee.  I also ordered to sandwiches to take home and they taste great and better yet, the aroma is even better.  There is a ton of stuff on this menu. I will come back again, although it is about 35 minutes from where I live in Henderson!!!  6.  Service - As good as it gets.  GK says, check it out.",

I passed by this joint a number of times, but never stopped in. Was feeling under the weather and thought what better than a delicious hot bowl of pho to give me some relief. I went in about 45 minutes prior to closing, and it was empty with the exception of a group of four people sitting down to eat. I was greeted by a very nice gentleman who I presume was the owner. We spoke briefly after I ordered my pho to go about the spice and how much I enjoyed spicy foods, the spicier the better for me. The restaurant was very clean. He gave me extra jalapenos and some of his extra spicy sauce. When I got home I couldn't wait to delve into my delicious pho, but immediately noticed that it had a different smell than I'm used to. It was a bit pungent to be honest. Whatever, I still wanted to give it a shot, so I put my fixings in and.......ugh it simply was not good. The broth had a sort of sweet taste to it, and just didn't mix well with the fixings. I added sprouts, jalapeno, onion, some lime, and some spicy sauce. Not even the sauce could take away that bitter sweetness. Needless to say this wont be my spot for pho. The three stars are for the cleanliness of the restaurant, the super nice owner/gentleman, and the simple fact that I only tried the pho, nothing else. I may go back to try another dish just based on the customer service.",

Vermicelli bowls out of this world! And the service is very humble and friendly. I'm happy to bring my business here. I don't have to go all the way to China Town now! If you want authentic Vietnamese and food that you will want to come back to get more, go here, you won't regret it.",

I read the reviews posted by others so while I am in Las Vegas I decided to \"stray\" from our usual spot, the Pho 8 and give the Viet Bistro a try. Well, we were not disappointed. First of all the service is exceptional. We were made to feel welcome immediately. The Lemon Ginger tea is awesome. Had the Cha gios and they were made by a mom because they were awesome. My mother had the Pho with the fillet and it was great. I had the Bun Bo Hue that everyone has been recommending here and I can say their Bun Bo Hue is the very best vietnamese soup I have ever had, bar none and I have traveled the world. We are going to the restaurant again before I leave so I can take my brother there (he swears by the pho 8). If you have not been to this restaurant, you really need to give it a try. It is that good.",

I was accompanied by my boyfriend who does not typically like Vietnamese food; however, he thoroughly enjoyed his Com Bo Luc Lac. I tried it as well, and the beef was tender and well-seasoned. I ordered Pho Tai and found the broth to be very tasty and the thin slices of beef also very tender. Having recently moved to Vegas from the SF Bay Area, I was worried that I wouldn't find an authentic, high-quality Vietnamese restaurant. Looks like I was wrong! :)",

The man who sat me and took my order was the only time he talked to me.   I got the pho dac biet (which is what I usually get at viet places). So, per usual, you get the bean sprouts, limes, jalapenos, & mint leaves. But.......once that plate arrived at my table, I noticed that one of the two limes I got was ALREADY USED...I was so hungry & sick that I proceeded on trying out the pho anyway. Which leads to my next problem--the broth. Never did I ever have to put SO much Sriracha and hoisin sauce in my life. The broth was THAT tasteless.  I've eaten here about 5 times including this time & each time was just going downhill. Also, they are more expensive than the usual bowl of pho that you get in Chinatown. So definitely not worth coming here anymore. Even if I am starving!",

I moved to Las Vegas a few months ago during the peak of the heat and haven't had much reason to chow down on some pho, but today in early pregnancy with terrible morning sickness all I wanted was pho.   This little place is amazing! The fresh ginger lemonade was a complete blessing for my stomach.  It's obvious the sweet, and family like owners are passionate about their food, as every piece of produce was extremely fresh in flavor, and even the fruit slices are sliced to perfection.

Chicken Pho full of fabulous flavor! I added jalapenos, bamboo shoots, basil and lime.  I ordered it sans cilantro and onions and it was perfect for this nasty cold I have.  The hubby had the Udon Noodle bowl with crabmeat and shrimp and also full of flavor and spicy too.  Eggrolls were delish, fresh and hot.  Thai Iced-Tea was the perfect blend.  Service Friendly.    Prices I think a bit high...$36 for two bowls, egg rolls and three iced teas.  The downer is that this place is in a strip mall located right next door to a stinky cigar shop...and yes sadly I could smell the smoke :(  Overall I don't think I would come running back because the cigar smell bothered me, but the food was well-made and full of flavor-maybe take out for my next visit!",

This is the best bahn mi I've ever had. It's served with a tasty broth. The waitress/hostess kept checking on me. Perfect! I will deff return.",

She took it back and not even 2 minutes later returned with a bowl - this had only 1 egg roll and 2 shrimp - despite the previous bowl having 2 egg rolls and 4 shrimp. I then examined the bowl and found peanuts in the pork - my boyfriend confirmed by tasting it... I could also smell it. This could have died from this exposure. Terrible service!",

    "text": "There is a lack of Pho joints up in the North West part of town, so an Asian place that isn't Japanese or Chinese is more than welcome in my book.  Especially because I don't have to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain to get good Pho.  I would give this place a 5 but it's lacking in a few areas.    1) I'm from So Cal and I'm used to Pho costing you no more than $5 for a huge bowl.  All the Pho bowls here are hovering around the $8-9 range.    2) Its right next to a cigar shop.  The constant wafting of cigar smoke/odor makes into this otherwise cute restaurant.  The odor kinda turns you off a bit.     So for me that took away a couple stars.  Now onto the good stuff:  Great Food!  I had a vermicelli with grilled shrimp bowl ($9) and it was delicious.  Everything a good bowl should be: Fresh ingredients, delicious seasonings, and the right amount every time.  The grilled shrimp was superb and the noodles with the accompanying sauce blended well together.  I'd definitely order it again.    Good Location.  Located right off the 95, its a perfect location for a Vietnamese joint.  The options in the Northwest are commercial and predictable.  This was a breath of fresh air to me.  Sometimes driving all the way downtown is not an option and this is right up my alley.  Attentive Service.  The servers there are always very helpful if you can't decide what you want.  They are very attentive and ensure you have everything you need.    Would I go again. . .Yes.",

The restaurant is modest but the food packs a punch with YUMMY. I enjoyed my first lunch experience so much trying the Special Combination Pho and Thai Iced Tea that I have to return shortly thereafter for a piping hot bowl of Oxtail Pho.  The broth tasted so flavorful and the smell was so rich in fragrant.  The delicacy of the fresh Thai basil, lemon, bean sprouts and slices of jalapenos peppers added to the  Pho danced my mouth. The slow cooking meat was very tender and for an extra $2.75 you can add a great assortment of vegetables (not cabbage). The service is fast but count on the server speaking English. I tried the Ginger Iced Tea lemonade with Mint and it was crazy good! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.",

But we like to try new places.  This place is also located right next to the Cupcakery and another favorite place of ours, The Market Grill.  We walked in and there was just one other family seated.  The place was fairly small (going theme for most Asian restaurants).  We were joyfully greeted by what appeared to be the owner.  What a pleasant man he was.  The menu was big so, it took us a few minutes to decide.  We got: Veggie Pho (minus the tofu) for me Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup) for hubby Chicken Pho (split between the kids) Bin Manh/Ban Minh??? (sliced pork sandwich)  Well, I gotta say, everything was quite delicious.  Although I wasn't a huge fan of the sliced pork sandwich, too much fat for my taste--ack.  I even cringed when I peeled the sticky fat from the pieces of meat so I could eat them on the sandwich.  Yeah, I have a thing about fat on my meats...must be trimmed clean.  My 6 yr old and hubby thought it was great though.  The service was good.  Our cups never went empty.    There was an odor to the place (other than Pho broth smell).  It smelled a little smoky.  As in cigarette smokey, which we can't stand.  We couldn't figure it out but it faded eventually or we got used to it.  Overall, good experience and then we had dessert at The Cupcakery.  =)",

    "text": "A little hidden treasure. My first Vietnamese food experience. The gentlemen, whom I presume is the owner, is wonderful. He taught us how to eat the egg rolls, even though I took a guess and wound up doing it right, I certainly appreciated the tutorial. I know he want to just wrap it up for me, but that would have been a bit awkward. Helpful, none the less. We ordered the egg rolls and fried wontons. We got egg roles and fried chicken wings. I know they sound the same. Fried. Oh well, we decided to keep them and they were good. I'd suggest, if this sort of thing would bother you, to speak clearly and point at what you want on the menu. We just rolled with it. I love that Viet is close to home. We also got there just before dinner rush, another plus. The portions (I noticed food is mostly served in bowls) are generous. For me, enough for leftovers. DING! Another plus. My shrimp and crab meat udan was amazing. I think I heard some angels sing. The flavor is so delicious. A new fav to add to my list and I know that this place will come in handy if I ever have a cold, that's for sure. I vow to eat pho, the next visit. Oh, and the gentlemen also gave us a little lesson on kimchi, because I asked if it asked Vietnamese which it isn't.  It's Korean, and I knew that, so I had a derp moment quickly followed up by getting my lesson and partial recovery from said derp moment. Anyhoo, I adore soup, and this is now my noodle soup heaven. Thank you, Viet Bistro, I shall return. Oh, yeah!I forgot to mention that they serve sandwiches!!! #houseofyum",

I got the chicken Pho and hubby got the combo Pho - and we were both amazed at how incredibly good it was.  I started feeling better from the first bite/slurp!  I haven't tried ALL the Pho shops in town, so consider that when I say.. this was, by far, the best Pho ever!  Service was attentive, the take-out for the leftovers was nicely packaged, and very affordable & excellent food.  Will I return?  Totally, and soon!",

This is the closet real Vietnamese restaurant that I could find...and it exceeded my expectations.  I was feeling adventurous so I decided to try something different...I always see my parents order the bun bo hue when I am in Seattle, but I've always been afraid because of the congealed pork blood that normally accompanies that dish.  I'm an ABC...so certain things still scare me even though I'm asian..ha.   I noticed they had bun bo hue on the menu BUT without the congealed pork blood and the pork hock was optional.  The lemongrass beef broth was warm, spicy, savory goodness.  The beef, beef tendon, and pork hock with wide rice noodles was the perfect rainy day weather meal.  The broth wasn't quite as spicy as I would like, but the owner came by and dropped off extra spicy sauce.  I think they tame the flavors down due to their clientele and have the optional pork hock as not to scare people.  My fiance tried the chicken vermicelli bowl.  The noodles were cooked well and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  This will be my go to Viet spot if I'm too lazy to drive to Chinatown!",

I like how they use blue film covers over the fluorescent overhead lighting to keep it from being too harsh, gives the dining room almost a lounge atmosphere.  But the food. Salt and pepper calamari order was $7 for 14 grease-soaked pieces, without any salt or pepper. Very bland, only tasted like grease, served with cups of sweet and sour sauce? Best part was the random pieces of fried carrot used as garnish.  The \"special combination\" bahn mi, with a smiley-face next to it on the menu, was a huge disappointment. Meat was all stacked on one end of the sandwich. I opened it up to distribute it evenly, only to find several blackened pieces of meat- the type of coloration that looks like food that has gone bad, not blackened from cooking. Picked out several pieces, then bit in, only to encounter some crazy spicy sauce or seasoning that was so strong it made my eyes water. All I could see were jalapenos (one piece on the entire sandwich?), and I don't mind those.   This place may be right next to my gym, and the pho may be delicious, but I will not be coming back. If you can't reliably serve unspoiled cooked meat on your sandwiches, I am not going to trust the meat cooked in your soups.",

    "text": "Decided to try Viet Bistro because I wanted to find a pho place closer to home instead of always having to drive down to Chinatown. This hole in the wall is definitely not worth another visit because the pho broth was mediocre and pretty bland, and the people working here don't speak much English and won't understand your order no matter how many times you say it while pointing at the item on the menu.  When we first walked into the restaurant, it seemed really dark and smokey. Rachel S and I were seated at a small table but I asked to be moved because they gave us the wobbliest table possible. To buy time to review the menu, I told the lady that we would start with an A8 (nem nuong cuon) while pointing direclty at \"A8\" on the menu. She seemed to have trouble understanding me so I repeated it multiple times while continuing to point at it. When our appetizer was brought out, it was like a bowl of noodles or something and I told them they had the wrong table because we didn't order that. She told me that I had said N8 right?...NO! WTF! How can you possibly get it wrong when I was pointing at A8 and repeating it about 100 times! The lady contested me and didn't believe me until she brought me the menu back and I showed her what A8 was.  At least our pho was made correctly but the broth was bland and tasteless. I added a bunch of hoisin sauce which helped a little, but that broth definitely needed a lot of help. The meat and noodles were fine. Just wished the bowl contained a little less steak and more tripe and tendon...because the bowl I ordered was supposed to have all 3 but all I saw was 1 piece of tripe and tendon and a ton of steak.  When our nem nuong cuon finally came out, it was ok. Definitely not the best although it still tasted good. They use cucumbers for crunch instead of egg roll shell crumbles like Nem Nuong Bistro/Brodard. Go there instead, especially because it's the same price at 2 for $4.95",

Lots of crab and the noodles did not get soggy or soft towards the end of the meal.  However, the bun bo hue was disappointing. The pork hocks were way under done. They are supposed to be tender and fall off the bone. I took a bite and couldn't even get a bite off! I had to pull it off with my hands. The broth wasn't spicy either. The noodles were good though.  We also got the shrimp spring rolls. It's two rolls cut in half and it has the thinnest piece of shrimp paste I have ever seen. Must have been less than 1/4\" thick for $6. Major rip off.  Plus the disgusting smell from the cigar shop next door. I won't be coming back. Kinh Do is much better!",

It's so close to my house that when I'm craving pork vermicelli or pho and don't want to head all the way to Chinatown, this is a great alternative. I also think the portions are decently large for the price. I also enjoyed the bun bo hue here, (I am not Vietnamese so I can't speak to the authenticity) it was decently spiced/spicy and had good chewy noodles, it just wasn't red as I have had before. They are missing some things on the menu that I usually see at other Vietnamese places, but they have quite a few selections which is nice. If you dine in, they serve soup with their banh mi too. The inside used to smell like a smoke shop, which was really annoying, but it's improved a bunch.",

It's consistent, the staff is nice and the food comes out quickly, making this place a good work lunch spot. I usually get the tofu and vegetable pho but last time I got the hue spicy lemongrass tofu and vegetable soup which kind of blew my mind. It has way more flavor than pho and they serve it with this spicy paste that ups the spice level tremendously. It's also served with mint instead of basil as well as the bean sprouts, lime and jalapeno. The noodles in this are round and similar to spaghetti instead of the vermicelli that comes with the pho. I actually prefer the vermicelli because the round noodles get soggy quicker but other than that this dish is far superior. My coworkers ordered the special combination banh mi and it was crazy small with not a lot of filling. It's too bad these don't come with anything but the sandwich. I think people would pay more for a side or pay less to be able to get two sandwiches. Overall I'm glad to keep coming back to Viet Bistro.",

    "text": "My friend invited me out to lunch today. It was my first time trying pho since I usually stick to ramen. We got to pick where we sat. It's a small place but you just have to know what the right times to come in are.   They only have Pepsi products.. Don't say that no one warned you! Their menu is very simple which is best when trying something new so it wasn't too overbearing for me!   I tried the fried wontons and the #1 without the cow stomach (it had a weird name?) The wontons were crispy and very good! It needed just a pinch of salt but then again, I always add too much salt to things as it is. It came in 4 pieces. It was $3.25 from what I remember. The pho comes in two different sizes. The regular is big but the large is huge! The large alone is enough to take home extras. The regular size is about 8.99. It's a fair price in my book! The broth is very light (keep in mind it's my first time trying pho) and I actually loved it. I added some salt (duh), soy sauce (I swear I'm going to die from high blood pressure) and Sriracha to it and it was just perfect. I don't really enjoy the noodles as much, but I loved the broth and beef so much. I think it was actually my favorite part! It also comes with a huge plate full of bean sprouts and limes so you can put as little or much as you'd like.   I should also add that they're very friendly here. It's a hidden gem right behind the Canes and In N Out on Rock Springs!   I'm happy with my first pho experience and I'll gladly come back here and try more things on the menu!",

    "text": "Went for lunch with my friends today after hearing about it from our hairdresser. We were nicely greeted by the workers, who we later found out were the owners of the restaurant. I've eaten at many Viet places and this was a pleasant visit.   It was supposed to be a light lunch, however, because the menu looked so interesting, we decided to try a number of items.    I had the special spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo, as they call it). It was well seasoned and the spiciness gave it a good kick.  I've never had this noodle anywhere else before, and since this was one of their signature soup entrees, I had a go with it.   My female friend tried the Beef La Lot (which was this deliciously aromatic bbq beef wrapped inside an edible green leaf and then grilled to perfection).  My guy friend ordered the Beef Pho and it was well flavored. It was accompanied by a plateful of vegetable garnishings, which were very fresh.   The three of us shared an order of 4 spring rolls (nothing like chinese eggrolls).  These were crunchy and crispy and it was accompanied by a plateful of lettuce and noodles.  It was such a healthful experience and then afterwards we also tried some desserts. The creme brulee and the 3 colored gelatin dessert was a great way to clean our palate.  Not to mention that the recommended ginger iced tea lemonade also did the trick on such a hot day as today.  It was cold and refreshing after a hearty meal.  The owner even recommended for us to try their 'banh mi' sandwiches and so we did (figured we'd want to snack on something a little later).    I'll be back and my friends will be back as well.",

Filet mignon pho. *sigh* I'm dreaming about it while I am actually eating it right now, it's that damn good.  The best part about this place is that they let you mix the ingredients yourself. All of the veggies are in their own bag, the beef is compartmentalized & raw so you can cook it fresh at home! Usually the hot broth at most places will over cook most meats, veggies & noodles by the time you take a pre-mixed pho home, ruining it. This place has tasty noodles, perfect lemongrass broth, tons of extra onions, both white & green, lime wedges to balance out the lemongrass & tender thin slices of soft tasting filet mignon. I get extra broth, so that I can make a few bowls over 2 days. The extra broth & pho is $17.85 & I give them $20, worth every damn penny. Every single time I have it ~ I wish I could drink some of Alice in Wonderland's shrinking potion, so that my mini-me could happily do the backstroke in the broth before slurping every good bit down. Worth the drive from wherever you are. :) *sigh* I think I will have another bowl.",

The service here is very good and the restaurant is clean and bright and still a little bit of a hole in the wall so that you feel like you have really found a gem.  As I left I looked sadly at all the silly people piling into the nearby Panera and Chipotle.  They didn't even know what they were missing!",

The pork spring rolls were okay, but bun bo hue became my fav. bun bo hue in vegas :) My only complaint about this place is the lighting, it feels weird inside and makes my eyes uncomfortable.",

I had always gone to spring moutain to get really good Pho, but I was excited to see this place on our side of town. I tried a couple of items, the shrimp rolls in rice paper were wonderful and fresh and I loved the peanut sauce. There was also a selection of different types of non-alcoholic drinks meant to referesh the palate. I tried the ginger iced tea lemonade and it was wonderful I had never had anything like it and can't wait to have it again. I had the special PHO with the satay and it was yummy, a nice spice but not too spicy. The prices were very reasonable and everything was fresh. I can't wait to go back and try the other items.",

The owners are delightful, and they put very good food on the table.  I always get the vegetable/tofu pho. Their broth is incredibly fragrant, and it comes fast and piping hot. Plenty of veggies, noodles cooked well, really good. I also enjoy their banh mi sandwich, all different kinds. One day I decided to order ginger tea lemonade instead of my usual water. Holy crap! Best drink I've ever had! I became obsessed quickly, and the woman who makes it fresh came out eventually to tell me how to make it. I won't be straining fresh ginger any time soon, so I just dream of it instead.  Great service, quick service, and friendly. Love Viet Bistro!",

Our food came out pretty quick, within 15 minutes even though it was pretty busy. I got the spring rolls (with pork and shrimp), a banh mi with pork and a large order of beef pho. Everything was really good and the bread they used for their sandwiches is really tasty. The only thing I didn't like was the super strong smell of cigars! Unfortunately it's right next to a smoke shop and for non-smokers like myself, the smell is extremely noticeable. Other than that, the food and service was great.",

I even got one of my \"white boy\" co-worker hooked on pho here.  He was recovering from throat surgery and needed something easy going.  He always begs me to get pho each time I see him.  #awesomeness.    Moreover, what sets this place apart from other pho joints is that it offers a lot more of a variety in their menu, not too mention they are more of a quality vs. speed eatery.  They appear to put a lot more love into their dishes compared to fast food, \"you eat and go home,\" pho spots.  However, it was kinda disappointing to learn that there their bun bo hue does not include pigs blood.  To most, this is a plus, but I'm that type of dude that appreciates the goods many tend shy away from.  The waiter explained that it's a health code violation to serve it.  Interesting to know.  Especially, since their are tons of \"violators\" out there if this is True.  Nevertheless, the bun bo hue was very tasty and I almost forgot that there was no cubed pigs blood.  It didn't come with the veggies however, but I guess since I was in a rush, I didn't stress it too much.  I also added a combo banh mi to go, but never got to savor it since I gave it to a hungry monster that kept nagging me...she knows who she is.  Caution, one of the waitresses speaks very little english, not to turn you off, but she is very nice.",

I sat next to the door and noticed that this place does A TON of take-out business.  I like the fact that chopsticks are made of permanent, plastic in a paper wrapper; not the usual flimsy balsa wood disposable chopsticks that give you mouth splinters.  I've eaten at some of the best Vietnamese places on both coasts. This place is the real deal and next time I'm back in Vegas for a conference,  I will surely be back!

I was the first customer here and even though it is supposed to open at 10, upon my arrival, I was told that they weren't ready to serve until 10:30.  I came at around 10:20, so I didn't need to wait too long, but keep in mind to not come at 10:00 on the dot or else you'll be waiting 30 minutes.  Anyway, being Vietnamese and always living in places with exceptional Vietnamese food (San Jose and Orange County in California), my standards for Vietnamese food are ridiculously high.  However, I recognize that I am in Las Vegas and not in California, so I can't compare Vietnamese eateries here to those that I've had.  The bun bo hue here was decent - the broth had good lemongrass flavor and the right spices and heat.  I wasn't dehydrated from MSG nor was the broth exceptionally greasy.  But the meat cuts and accompanying veggies were lacking.  This definitely takes away from the authenticity.  There was also not enough meat, in my opinion.  The bowl is kind of small, so I would size up if you have a moderate to big appetite.  The service here is good, especially for a Vietnamese restaurant.  The prices are fair - most things were between $7 and $12.  Portions are small to decent.  The menu had a good variety.  Although this is definitely not the best Vietnamese food that I've had, it is decent enough to satisfy a Vietnamese food craving.",

Basically walked in at 8:17 P.M. and was greeted with a \"Hi, to go?\" I said, \"No, it's for here.\" she told me that if I eat there, that i have to be done by 9oclock. Cause they have to go. I don't live close to this place. So we drove out here for no reason. I worked in Food and Beverage for over a decade. I used to hate when people would come in late. But never would I say what she said to me. It was very unprofessional, and she should have nothing to do with this company. She's bad for business. This occurred 12-23-17.   P.s. This place needs music.   P.s.s. The Pho is great.",

    "text": "This was a last minute decision and a good one.  I had the shrimp with crunchy egg noodles. The nest of noodles sat on some kind secret house sauce. The top was crunchy and the bottom of the nest was tender. It had a bit of spring though, not as tender as glass noodles.   The squid was so tender and flavorful. If you want to get away from deep dried squid then come here as your first try to other cooking methods.  The shrimp was tender and flavorful as well. Steamed just right. The star was the baby bok choy. Bok choy can be tricky to cook. Done the wrong way baby bok choy can be bitter. This baby bok choy was crispy yet tender and not bitter. Understand, not every piece will not be bitter,but this place has the best baby bok choy.   The disappointment of the dish were the couple fried fish balls. Don't be afraid of those, if cooked properly they are tasty. These however, were rubbery. Such a shame.  Their egg rolls were wonderful with a bit of pork, glass noodles, and what looked brine shrimp (know they were not). It was presented with a dipping sauce of light fish sauce and lime. The dipping sauce was light and brought out the egg  roll flavorful.",

The chicken in the rice did NOT taste like chicken. The Pho was bland. I didn't know that bland Pho existed. The spring rolls were 95% iceberg lettuce. My stomach is cramping right now. We won't be going there again.  Update 11-12-16-I have had severe cases of diarrhea & vomiting since eating there last night. Do not eat there for your own well-being. These people WILLINGLY served my one year old child rice with bad chicken. Thank goodness that we didn't let HIM eat it.",

    "text": "Thought this place was an all right place for some Vietnamese fix. Thought their prices were slightly higher considering, however, it beats having to drive a ways way. So more like a good 3.5 stars. I personally don't prefer this place and would rather make the drive...but the husband doesn't mind his pho. He thinks it isn't so bad. I'm more of a banh mi person which is why I don't prefer this place for it because of price to ratio. We'd normally come in if the husband is feeling pho-ish as we wait for our kids to get out of their faith formation class up the road.   The owners, however, are really nice and welcoming from our experiences. They used to have a business back <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhome.in&s=79d2777d294c000addf3de19d6ab214cf6141a17b74d91c07c0afaeb5302471d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">home.in</a> Hawaii so I'm all about supporting traces of 808. The place is pretty clean. I just couldn't stand the smell of the cigars while eating. I'll smoke a cigar...but just don't prefer the smell of it when I'm having dinner with my younger kids.  Anyway, I'd recommend them as I think they're one of the sure bets around this way. And gosh knows we dont have much pho options around this way. But if you are having a serious pho crave that doesnt want to be ruined...I'd say just make the trip to chinatown. This place isnt anything to shoot across town for. More like a decent spot to get your vietnamese fix (if it's in your proximity) without traveling too far out. You could squeeze a stroller in but I think you should keep it in the trunk if possible.   Enjoy!",

But one tragic day... their pho became no longer good..... I thought, \" Maybe it was just that one time.\" So I went back a few more times. It only got worse and worse. I would eat their bland pho and drink their nasty water (their soda is pretty gross too) while trying not to suffocate from the retched cigar odor.

I wrote a slightly more detailed review on my own Vegas blog so I am not going to go into tons of detail but - if you have a means to get here - please go.  You will not regret it.",

Luckily I'm 26 and not 66 so instead of yelling about change and being stubborn about new things while I watch diabetes commercials during the Price is Right, I man up and take action!  I liked the feel of Viet Bistro and the overall atmosphere was great.  I also got the feeling the waitress wanted me (to buy?) so that helped the experience as well.  I honestly have no idea what I ordered since I had no idea what anything was, but it was pretty good and I would love to try it again down the road.  The service was great and I have no real reason to hate the place.  Conditions for Me To Return: - Have the gf make her homemade pho then - be In the mood for pho",

What sets them apart from other regional cuisines in Vietnam is their relatively small serving size with refined presentation, a vestige of its royal cuisine.   But the star of Hue is the Bun Bo Hue, spicy beef udon. There are many places that claim to make Bun Bo Hue in Las Vegas, but I would only go to two, Bosa 1 and now Viet Bistro. The service at both these establishments puts all other Vietnamese restaurants to shame.   This review is really for all the Bun Bo Hue fiends out there, you will be hooked!",

All in all, not bad, but no need to go back, I'll try somewhere else. Would give three stars if there was a little more meet in the dish.",

I love their ice coffee.  I love their Bo La Lot (go to my My T's review for definition).  They have a stir fried shrimp dish which is fantastic, and be wary if you ask the chef to make it spicy, he can really make it spicy.    Special note:  When you order pho, you can order a side of onions sauteed in vingar and sugar.  However, the owner brought us a different version of this, which had lime and sriracha.  Oh my god this was delcious.  You have to get it!    My one complaint is the tables are too small, but eh, for good service, I will deal with a lot worse.",

The water tasted weird but we're in Vegas and all the water I taste EVERYWHERE tastes like a weird mineral deposit, so what do I know.  On to the actual food:  I ordered beef & vermicelli noodles. Pretty good standard fare, beef tasted good, etc. The sauce was a little less flavorful than I'm used to and overall I'd say it was average verging on good. My partner ordered beef pho. She has low standards but I've gotta say this pho was pretty strange. The broth tasted unusually of cinnamon and the beef was FULL of fat & incredibly overcooked. She was picking the huge amounts of bad cuts of meat out of her bowl the entire night (like literally, strings and gobs of beef fat). I totally get that the beef in pho is supposed to be softer than normal beef, but seriously this stuff was so overcooked it was vaguely gummy and would've been best appreciated by someone with no teeth.  Overall I'd say average/not-so-good. Might not be back.",

    "text": "I have been to Viet Bistro many times as it is the closest Pho in the northwest. I prefer a few of the Pho restaurants in China Town but for days when I am too tired to drive there this is where we go. It is for the most part as good as any Pho, broth is flavorful, decent sized. The Satay has great flavor but it definetely spicy. I have also ordered the Bun before which is also good, what is to be expected. We normally get the spring rolls too which comes with a peanut sauce, again good but nothing outstanding.  I prefer my peanut sauce a little thicker but at least the peanut flavor is good.   The two things I don't like about this place is it is a $1 or $2 more than other Pho restaurants and it is right next door to a Cigar shop, the smell of Cigars (which I like in certain settings but not with food) seeps into the restaurant. I think the smell must come from the ventilation because there is no way that much just comes in from the outside.   So bottom line if you are looking for decent Pho in the northwest then this is the place to go.",

    "text": "First time the BF and I dropped in I grabbed bun with pork, shrimp and eggroll. Their bun is really good. The eggroll was nice, the pork and shrimp had a nice marinade and was cooked to juicy. The noodles were blanched just right and the veggies below were very fresh. The BF had the curry and while it was full of mixed veggies and chicken, he didn't really like it. I tried a bit later at home and it tasted more like gravy than curry and I thought it was okay, but not something I would order again.   We weren't feeling so great this week and came for their vegetable and tofu pho. I don't think they have vegetarian broth here or if they do it's not on the menu. There was a lot of broccoli, carrots, bokchoy and tofu in it so they didn't skimp on that which is nice and the sprouts and basil and the \"saw leaf\" that came to the table was very fresh. The broth was a bit too heavy with white pepper and star anise though. It did the trick with helping my sore throat, but it was abit overpowering of a flavor that I don't prefer. I hope that this isn't the usual and was just an off day...I would give it a chance again.    I generally think the quality of ingredients here is better than the standard and because of the location far from any competition, the prices reflect both things so keep that in mind. People get so used to dirt cheap pho that you may feel it's expensive even though most items are below 10 bucks. I think the service is decent, and friendly both times and seem family run.   I say, come for the bun / rice plate , but some of the other things I'm not too sure about. I'm sure we will be back. Sometimes we just don't want to drive all the way from Centennial to Chinatown to get some Viet food.",

The wrappings were a bit chewy and the filling was all lettuce with a few shrimp. But, the dinner was good and made up for it. We had a combo bowl with a little bit of everything in it over rice noodles. Service is good and everything is clean. Although the rolls Arny the best I've had, the meal is overall quite good and since its convenient, I'll continue to eat here when I feel like a quick and good meal.",

    "text": "I can't move!  Writing this as we sit and wait for our food only because there was one thing that stood out so strong about the place. The strong smell of cigar inside this small little 11 table restaurant. It's because of the cigar place next door. MAN is it strong. Ventilation has to improve for me to be able to properly rate this.   Located in a Plaza on Lake mead and , the parking here is crazy full. So set just enough time to get a proper parking spot where you don't to have to walk.   So, like I mentioned in my header, it is small inside. 11 tables @ a probably of max 30 people and 4-5 people per table at their biggest table. So if you have a big group, you may want to call ahead so they can combine tables. As for their single table, it's pretty small as well. Condiments take up some space, and as soon as drinks, appetizers, and food come, your all out of realestate.   What we ordered: 2x P1 Combination phone with rare steak, flank, tendon, meatball, and tripe.  Fried tofu appetizer  Thai tea with boba to go.  The tofu was cooked very well. Nice golden seasoned crust with their special sauce. Yummy! The pho is good. In fact it's not bad at all. Meat proportions is just right, I love their tendon here, noodle is the perfect length, and the soup base has the right consistency of flavor. Satay sauce is a bit more spicy than we are used to, but it worked.   Customer service is great. Seated eight away even thought limited seating, but was served and taken care of from beginning g to end. Greeted and thanked.  Overall, this is definitely a come to place for us. Doesn't beat our favorite Photos Saigon 8, but definitely the runner up when we don't feel like making that trip to spring mountain.   I would definitely rate this higher if the cigar smell did not linger. Otherwise, we found a new pho spot to eat at.",

First off they're lucky we stayed after seeing the how dirty it was and no water until they decided to come take our order. The Thai tea smelt and tasted like dirty dishes. Not to mention that it's well overpriced compared to other places. The egg rolls are the skinniest I've ever seen, they were lumpia size, and the fish sauce was watered down for sure. My Pho tasted like star anise, nothing else. My wifes Bun Thit Nuong had a spoonful of bland pork. They never once filled my water or even asked how it was. They are lucky we're nice people and felt bad otherwise we would've never paid for this slop. We should've went to In and Out or Five Guys. Good luck",

    "text": "Decided to go here during my lunch break after not having any Vietnamese food for quite some time!   I ordered bun thit nuong cha gio (rice noodles with pork and egg rolls). The dish itself was good and I don't really have any major complaints, but I will say that the flavor isn't as strong as some other restaurants I have been to. Although that could be due to the fact that I've been to a bunch of Vietnamese restaurants back in Garden Grove (in California) and the food there is cheaper as well xD. The veggies were good and the egg rolls were crispy, albeit they were on the skinny side haha. One thing I didn't like was how the noodles was all clumped and sticky since it took some time and maneuvering with my chopsticks to be able to mix all the ingredients together. Besides that, everything else went smoothly lol.  The atmosphere was clean and the staff was very polite and attentive (which is a big plus considering Asian restaurants have been known to lack good customer service). I saw a good amount of people in the restaurant which was reassuring although I didn't see many Asian people in there at that time xD. Where are all my Asian peeps at?   Overall, this is a good place to check out if you want some Vietnamese food and you are in the area. The portions are good and the price isn't that bad compared to how much you would spend for a meal. I'll check out some other nearby places so stayed tuned in case I find something better!",

They have other food as well like rice dishes & appertizer like fried tofu, egg rolls ( 2 pcs = $3.50 ; 4 pcs = $6.50), shrimp spring rolls, satay, etc also if you want extra broth.. small size = $3 & big size = $5.  I order pho #5 which is rare round beef & meatball & my husband order Pho #7 which is rare round beef. I try the broth Before I mix the noodle and taste to salty for some reason after I mix the noodle & meat..the broth taste plain.

Its always clean and theres room for a family of 5. Prices are decent and size value is decent as well.

    "text": "I happened to be in the area so decided to stop in and try their thai iced tea and a bbq pork sandwich.  The tea was okay, although a bit on the weak side.  I didn't care for the sandwich...way too much cilantro for me and also quite dry. Little to no taste of bbq, so don't order this expecting a bbq sandwich that you might be used to, because this ain't it.   I wouldn't order a sandwich again.  Total for a not very large Thai ice tea and sandwich:  $10.50.  Too pricey for what you get (or don't get).   Maybe they have other things that are better?  On the positive side, the smoky air a lot of people complain of (coming from the cigar store next door), really didn't seem to be much of an issue.  There's a slight hint of smoke in the air but not much at all, and they had an air purifier machine thing in the front of the shop by the cash register, so that probably is helping.",

But entering this place is like going into a cigar lounge I'm guessing because of the tobacco shop adjacent to the restaurant but it is overpowering and really nasty as I hate tobacco and the smell of it. The food wasn't very good at all the broth needed a lot of flavoring added to it and all the noodles just seemed to clump together in the bottom of the bowl in one large gross lump.  I added bean sprouts and Sriracha but I have to give the flavor and food a thumbs down. Make the trip to Saigon 8 is not far from here and the food tastes much better plus the selection is more varied. If you do happen to come to this location the P1 would be the only thing I would even bother ordering but I won't be coming back.",

Service was rather quick. The man who attended to us seemed to be the owner, he was approachable and would give recommendations if you ask.   Our food was out pretty fast. I ordered the beef pho with eye round steak and beef balls while the bf got his usual chicken pho. We also got the vietnamese iced coffee.   I love the broth! It was not as greasy as some of the other vietnamese places I've been to, and you can actually taste the herbs. The rice noodles was meh, it was a little too starchy for me, for some reason. The eye round steak was a little overdone. Iced coffee was a tad too sweet, there's a little too much of the condensed milk.   Overall, a decent experience. I'll probably come back again.   Side note: if you like spicy food, ask for the ot satay sauce. it's basically Thai chillies fried with garlic paste and it is SPICY- a much better alternative to siracha, in my opinion.",

Aside from the smell of the tobacco from next door,  the service is slow and has poor customer services.  Have to ask for spoons and for refills of water. Their regular pho was water down, bland and no favor whatsoever.  Their rice dish was dry and is not favorful. Their bun bo hue is nothing like the real bun bo (i guess it something & better than nothing). I only come pho satay cause it's different and unique. i called in to place a to go,  they forgot basil leaves and my satay (i always order pho satay, how can u eat it without satay on the side).  So i started to check my orders the next time when placed a to go. Happened again, asked the lady and she went in the back,   cameo out to handed me a half of an oz of satay for three large pho satay. I then asked for more satay, and she gave an oz container of satay...came home w half cooked rice noodle (banh pho). Ppl to go food home cause we don't want to cook, so i have to boil a pot of hot water to dip in all the rice noodles again.  I want to say i like this place still but the quality and how the customer services is now,  i will rather go eat Thai food or drive myself to pho Saigon 8, better pho and services aren't sloppy. I'm not being unreasonable,  this happens one too many times.  I used to worked at a pho place and this i see is unacceptable.",

Just needed a quick bite to eat before work so I ordered it to go. The peanut sauce that came with them was pretty good, and the spring rolls themselves were light and refreshing to munch on. Also got a Thai tea with boba to go with my meal. Although the boba was a bit misshapen and clumpy, the tea was made just right, so I'd recommend getting that by itself.  I think that $4.50 for an order of two spring rolls is a little much, but I'm willing to pay since it saved me a trip to Spring Mountain. Otherwise, the service was great and friendly. I'll have to come back to eat in to form a complete opinion of this place.",

It was pretty distracting.  The (I assume owner) greeted us, made recommendations and in general, we felt taken care of so that is a major plus in a Viet restaurant.  The quality of the food is standard but the portions are huge! The $6.50 regular pho bowl was the size of a large normally in my opinion, and it came with like 8-10 slices of beef! Seemed never ending. The special spices he offered also gave things a nice kick. The food flavor hit the spot but I'm not incredibly picky about my Pho. I love Pho, I find it hard to mess it up.  The Com Bi was a disappointment. The pork chop was good but the steamed egg cake was inedible, everyone at the table agreed. And the biggest offense was they don't use real broken rice.  Overall we enjoyed our meals here sans a few hiccups but good service means a lot. I'd definitely come back.",

First, they dont have a lunch special so we ordered and got a Large Pho for $11.00 and a Sandwich for $5.50. (meh, they're plain, a few slices of meat and dry) Pho was pretty descent but a bit pricey. $11.00 + tax + service charge  total around $14 for lunch? just the noodle soup and water. We love to eat Pho so we have a bunch of restaurants to compare it to.  So I thought of testing it out and asked the waiter if they charge for an extra soup Pho. yup they sure do! a small bowl of plain soup is around $3+ and a large is $5+.... now, that's unheard of! Some restaurants would charge  a dollar or two. but that's too greedy! So, Now I know I and tried the place and don't have to eat here again.",

It's not overly seasoned with lemongrass and does not have that pineapple taste like how many other places do it. The beef is tender and the noodles are always cooked right. They're very generous with their portions too. I've also tried their pho, fried rice, egg rolls and they're all pretty good. I however did not like their banh mi. It was small, greasy and overpriced. The place can also use some upgrades in the inside. The service is always good from what I've experienced.

The pho was pretty good, no thing out of the ordinary but the broth was tasty and the beef was soft and flavorful. Surprisingly the chicken fried was was pretty damn good, enjoyed that over the pho to my starving nephew's dismay.  Overall a good place to drop in if you're close by and craving Vietnamese food.",

Now I understand why it doesn't have 4-5 stars.  Even when empty the service is slow and lacking and the quality of the food, well.  Let's just say I won't be going back, not even to give them a second chance.  I know every restaurant has it's way of doing things but when you've tried something great, your expectations are high and this failed to meet those expectations in presentation, flavor, and freshness of the food.  Even the vegetarian rolls weren't as good as I hoped it would be.  They don't describe items in the menu and the explanation makes one feel dumb as one still does not understand.  So if you've never had Pho and don't speak Vietanese, don't come here.",

The restaurant smells strongly of cigarettes. It is as if someone is having a cigarette or two in kitchen-because it is prominent near register. The woman that worked there was very nice and fast to bring my order. I left my credit card and had to come back and she helped me again. The male owner was rude and just watched me as I struggled with the door. The woman on the other hand greeted me at the door when I struggled to come in. The vermicelli noodles, egg rolls and Thai iced tea was over priced for the quality and portion size. The door issue and the smoke made me never want to come back.",

Of course gotta get a large! Price was cheap too!   My girl got some kind of beef and rice combo. Food arrived in a descent reasonable amount of time. Presentation was beautiful. Could not wait to dig in!   Drenched my pho with that sprouts, jalapeno, lime and siracha! Mixed all those babies up!   Every single sip and bite was...  glad I found this place. The beef and rice combo was superior too. Tender and juicy with onions and peppers.   Overall experience was fantastic. I was very satisfied of my meal. Will come back soon!",

I haven't seen a pho restaurant with all of the condiments on the table, Sriracha, hot chili sauce, red chili sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sugar and pickle jalapenos. These are some required condiments at a pho restaurant. That's my opinion.   This place is about the right size for a bistro. Why does the name bistro have to always be too pricey for a bowl of pho? Easiest thing to make and the cheapest. Most of their other food looks really good when I was looking at the other table.   I guess I'm trying to compare these pho restaurants to the ones in California...Sacramento. I've been to several pho restaurants in many cities. It's the size of the bowl, taste/broth, price and the meats are what makes a customer keep coming back. I should also add customer service.   Overall, I think this is a pretty decent pho restaurant outside Chinatown.",

Now, I wasn't too impressed with the reviews, but you gotta understand, the food choices that we have up north are pretty limited.  But we decided to take a chance.    First off, as soon as we walked in, it smelled like smoke, as if someone was smoking inside.  That was a turnoff right then and there.  Even the teenager was wondering why it smelled like smoke.  We should have left but we stayed cause we were starving.  The customer service that we received could have been better.  The lady didn't give us our menus til 5 minutes after we sat down.  She got me and my son's order wrong and kept INSISTING we ordered a different item.  So I obviously was not happy with the service we received.  Now the pho, the broth was plain, didn't have much flavor in it.  I pretty much had to drown it with a ton of lime, sriracha and hoisin sauce.  The rest of the fams weren't too impressed either.  Bottom line, if we are ever craving for pho, we'll just make the trip down to Spring Mountain.",

    "text": "I did something different today. Whenever I try a Vietnamese place for the first time, I usually get the combination pho. It's my baseline dish for comparing Vietnamese restaurants.  But thanks to My T's review, I just had to try their Bun Bo Hue. It's something I've never ordered before, so I have nothing with which to compare. That's really not a problem, of course. In the end, I enjoyed the soup. My friend, Lisa Y, says it's not her fave BBH in town. As for me, it was pretty darn good. I loved the tenderness of the beef. It wasn't very spicy--from what I understand, BBH is supposed to be spicy--but it had a nice hint of heat that enhanced the flavor without the usual runny nose effect.  I should point out that the bowls did not come out with pig feet. I asked about them and they brought a couple right out. I guess they figure that pig feet probably don't appeal to non-Vietnamese people, but it's listed as part of the dish on the menu! Anyway, that's a minor complaint.  The one weird thing about this place is the lighting. It's fluorescent, but many of the panels are blue, while a couple of them are orange. They just give the place a strange hue. Obviously, it's not a reason to avoid the place. But as a photographer, it's something that caught my attention.",

The price was a little bit expensive compared to other places. Our oxtail soup was 12 bucks which is 9 bucks or less in other places.

The main fella there always greets my boy and myself with a smile. I usually stay with chicken pho, which is delicious here but my most recent visit I decided to be adventurous and try the oxtail pho and was even more impressed!  I am always excited for our pho day because it is always delicious when we go. My little guy loves the noodles as well :) The price is pretty fair, a little more expensive than most but the taste and quality is worth the extra couple dimes. Lastly, try their coffee!

My friend and I were in the mood for some Bun (vermicelli rice noodle dish) and we decided to try Viet Bistro, I'm really happy that we did.  We were greeted at the door by Kevin the owner, he's very nice and took great care of us.  We ordered fresh shrimp Summer Rolls and fried pork Spring Rolls for appetizers. I ordered grilled Pork Bun for my main, and my friend got the grilled Chicken Bun.  Summer rolls came up first. They were fresh and tasty, but not exceptional. The paper-thin softened rice paper is stuffed with shrimp, pork, cabbage and a small amount herbs. The peanut sauce they come with is ok, but we asked for some fish sauce with them which was better. I would have liked a bit more fresh herbs (basil, mint, cilantro, or something) with these because they were just a bit bland.  Next came the friend pork spring rolls, wow they were really good. These are served in traditional Vietnamese style with lettuce and cilantro to wrap around the fried roll, and fish sauce for dipping. What made these great was how crispy the fried outer roll was. It's such a great texture and flavor combination to roll up the fried spring roll in lettuce with the cilantro inside, then dip the whole thing in fish sauce. Yummy!  Next came our main dishes, grilled pork and chicken bun bowls. This is a dish that I really love, but it needs to be done right. I've been disappointed the last few times I got this dish at places in Chinatown due to soggy overcooked noodles, burnt/overly charred meat, or not-so fresh veg.  Viet Bistro does Bun proper. The noodles were a perfect al-dente with amazing texture, the bean sprouts and other veg were crisp and fresh, the grilled pork was caramelized to perfection, and it had just the right amount of fresh herbs.   If I have to nit-pick for a con, I would say the fish sauce could be a bit stronger. It's good, but tastes a little watered down compared to how I normally like it.  Overall, this place is an easy 5 stars for the food and friendly owner/host.  Side note:  Upon entering this place I immediately smelled very strong cigar / pipe tobacco smoke. I asked the owner why it smelled and he explained it was the cigar shop next door. He seated us in the back where the smell was not so bad. There is also outdoor seating which I would recommend if you are sensitive to the smell of smoke.  It's unfortunate that the cigar shop next door is polluting the surrounding restaurants and shops. There's a cupcake shop on the other side of the cigar shop, and it has the same issues with the smoke smell. The guys at this cigar shop should be using better ventilation or something.",

Anyways I'm a very picky Pho person because I'm all about homemade ;) So when choosing a pho place I sort of turn into a pho nazi.  This place wasn't the worst nor the best, but it was pretty good I must say.   A regular bowl was perfect not to big nor too small. The broth had lots of flavor but it wasn't mind blowing good they used a lot of ginger in the broth which isn't bad but if you no like ginger then I don't know maybe you no like it because it has a strong ginger aroma when brought to the table. (Excuse my FOB moment) But it was good. Oh and an added plus I'm happy that they didn't get stingy with noodles like some places do. When ordering pho you always get a small plate of veggies for your soup I just wish they offer more variety of oriental greens selections like the other places.  I also ordered some coconut juice :) it was awesome! It came out in a fresh coconut!!   Service was great food came fast and it was a very friendly environment. It's great to have a good pho place close by in our NW area. I will definitely consider coming back for a quick grab n go place to eat.",

This place is a small Vietnamese joint in a strip mall next to what I hear are also restaurants worth checking out. I enjoyed their vermicelli noodle bowl with the shrimp, steak, and egg rolls combo on top. The giant bowl of goodness was less than $10 and filled me up despite being on the light side. Their special sauce is a must try if you are in the area. Add some Sriracha to your bowl and you have a perfect meal.   Service was super friendly and quick, I'm glad I found this spot!",

You get fresh basil that isn't black & wilted & a good amount of meat in the soup.  My last few times eating pho in Chinatown, the basil was on it's last leg.  Also, I usually have to order extra sliced beef on the side...not so here.  They don't skimp on the dead cow flesh!    They know how to make good eggrolls, springrolls & banh mi as well!  Probably the best pho I've had since I've moved back to Vegas...still not as good as my spot in Seattle, but it will do for now.",

    "text": "Spring Mountain's endless road of reasonably priced Pho restaurants just made it's way up to to the North West.  And it's about time!  I waited with baited breath for this restaurant to open in one of my favorite plazas adorned with Panera, Chipotle, Cupcakery, and Market Grille Cafe, already a great offering of casual dinner spots.  It finally opened and I managed to get in around 1:30PM for lunch, after running a few errands.    The interior is very purple, with fresh flowers, tinted lights, and a closed off kitchen.  Comfortably seating 31 people, it's a somewhat intimate space.  There would three other tables there, two of which were Vietnamese diners.  (Which is always a good sign.)  I was greeted with a bit longer of a menu than I expected, (Not Pho Kim Long's length or anything like that, about five pages of offerings.)  I went with the generic route of ordering Spring Rolls and a basic \"everything\" bowl of Pho.  The Pho: Very good.  Not salty at all.  Came out lightening quick, and has a good balance of noodles vs. meat.    Spring Rolls: Really good.  Flavorful, crispy yet moist on the inside with a really nice garnish presentation.    The girl who owns it was very friendly and was ready to make a few recommendations for me on what to order.  I went with a very generic choice since i kind of wanted to get a baseline of what the quality was before I ordered the \"house specialties\", not to mention that I wasn't terribly hungry so I didn't want to overload with appetizers and soup and etc.    I am of the opinion that like all businesses, they're somewhat new with the service so it's going to take a bit to get running super smooth, (i.e. my appetizer came out the same time as my Pho, which made me feel a little rushed), but all good things take time.    I hope things do well for Viet Bistro as it's pretty good food with friendly service at an excellent price without the drive to Spring Mountain.",

We were there at 10:30am and no one else was there. The men just started setting up everything when we sat down and they open at 10am. I noticed a distinct smell but I brushed it off thinking its just because my stuffy nose. I used their restroom to wash my hands. The trash was full. That means they never disposed it from the night before. Just outside the restroom were empty boxes. I peeked through one of them and it was dirty. When I passed by the door to the kitchen, I saw that everything was not organized and looked like someone left in a hurry the night before. When I got to the table, my husband tells me that the water tasted weird and the cups were dirty. He said the place is dirty and I agreed. I thought to myself if the place is dirty, I don't know about the food. I brushed it off my head telling myself the food must be bomb. They brought out the deep fried tofu first which we really liked. The pho that we ordered was just average. The shaking beef  looked black like burnt. It tasted fine but not something I'd recommend. An hour later me and my husband got an upset tummy. I wouldn't recommend this place after that.",

They have a large menu, including Banh Mi, which is nice.  We ordered some rice vermicelli noodles, an order of shrimp summer rolls and an order of pork summer rolls, and I had a bbq pork banh mi.  The shrimp rolls were fine...no better or worse than any other place I have been to.  I really enjoyed the pork ones, as they had a nice bbq flavor to the pork.  My banh mi was very tasty and had a super fresh and soft baguette.  It was filled with a healthy assortment of vegetables and had a good taste as well as crunch factor.  The meat could have been a little more thick, as it just had one thin layer of the pork, basically the same as the summer rolls.  For $5.50 it came with a little soup cup, which was delicious.  It was hot and refreshing and I enjoyed it immensely.  They screwed up my banh mi by putting mayo after I asked them not to, and despite the fact that I had eaten half of it already before I really noticed (1 half was much heavier with mayo), they remade the whole thing for me.  The waitress was very nice and friendly, and I did not lack for water or beverage refills at all.  My wife enjoyed her noodles, especially the fried spring roll that came with it.    Overall, I thought it was a very solid meal and there are many other choices I want to try as well, including a beef roll wrapped in some kind of leaf.  The banh mi addition was nice, since I cannot often find too many banh mi places.  The food was pretty decently priced, and the service was good and friendly.  My sandwich was great and the rolls were pretty good too.  Overall, as I said, 4.5, but there were really not glaring faults and I would certainly return soon.

So, I was quickly seated and the server asked if I knew what I wanted. I told him the bun bo hue and later added the grilled pork meatball spring rolls.   First, I am nt an expert on bun bo hue by any means. My ratings relate more to the overall quality of the dish and not so much to the flavors. The smell and the taste of the soup didnt remind me of pork or beef, but of onions. It was tasty, but I felt it should have had more beef or pork flavor to it. Garnishes consisted of bean sprouts, slice jalapeno, and limes. No other herbs or greens were given. The slices of beef were chuck full of connective tissue. That's not a bad things since the meat was well braised and tender. They were skimpy with the meat however. The lack of beef is further emphasized by the fact there is no pork blood or pork hock in the soup. The only real plus of this dish was it was not too spicey and I was allowed to adjust the spiciness to my taste. The grilled pork meatball spring rolls were ice cold. I think they were made earlier and left to sit. They didn't wow me.  Not sure if I came too late and they ran out of ingredients or what, but was very disappointed for sure.",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise to find a Vietnamese restaurant pop up in this NW neighborhood.    The place is small (holds 31 people), with walls painted orchid and new tile floors.  The staff were just as bright and shiny (friendly) as the decor.  I decided to go straight up the middle with the Bun Bo Hue.  The Thai Ice Tea probably isn't a proper match, but I had a craving for it.  :)  The soup arrived before I could return from washing my hands for lunch.  It was very good, but a bit bland, probably due to their holding back after seeing the round-eye in the American Flag t-shirt.  Whatever, I'm used to it.  Nothing that a big dollop of chili sauce can't cure!  Delicious broth, beef parts, noodles, sprouts, veggies and herbs.  Yum!  The prices are reasonable and perfectly average for this type of fare.  Lunch special is 10% off from 11am-3pm.  Happy Hour (sorry, they don't serve alcohol... Or else this place would be PERFECT) is 20% off from 3pm-6pm.  A great solo first experience.  I will DEFINITELY come back with family and friends in tow to explore the menu further.",

I ordered the Pho Ga to go and the moment I stepped into the restaurant all I could smell was cigarette. It smelled like an old run down bar. It was incredibly unappetizing but still since I had ordered it to go I figured the actual meal might be worth it. Not exactly. To start, all the add ins (sprouts, jalapenos, limes) were all old and dusky. The chicken smelled and tasted sour so I didn't add it into my Pho. The noodles were about the only appetizing thing and the broth was ok, but nothing I would go back again for.",

Of course, I go more frequently in the fall and winter for their Pho. My usual is the Brisket and Flank Steak Pho. Once in awhile, I'll order the Seafood. My siblings enjoy their Banh Mis, especially the Special Combination. We'll also order the Fresh Spring Rolls that come with peanut sauce.  Like their Thai Tea with Boba in the spring and summer. We recently got to try their coffee with sweet condensed milk - that was certainly different. I recommend stirring it before every sip, otherwise it clots at the bottom of the cup. It's weird how the milk only lightened the bitter coffee taste most places mask.  Anyway, service is always friendly and efficient. They always check on their patrons at least once during the meal, which is fine by us 'cause we don't ask a for a lot whenever we stop by. Hahaha... We just order our entire usual meal at the beginning, then ask for the bill and boxes at the end. Exceptions are whenever we order something to go for the family after my sister and I have a lunch date or something, and they never make us feel like it's a hassle.",

I came around 4 pm on Wednesday & ordered to-go because we had been studying at Panera the whole day & I wanted Asian food. I absolutely love fresh lumpia made well, & have been in search of it in Vegas for a while. Every place here advertises pho but not lumpia! Anywho, I decided to make just one order in case it sucked & I was glad I did. The lumpia itself was ok--crispy, fresh, of a good size & wrapped tightly, great dipping sauce--but not great. The shrimp was cut into halves of shrimp so instead of being a whole row of shrimp on one side, it was a whole row of half a shrimp. Whut. Also, no bean sprouts, and the very light slivers of rice noodles were inside the crisp lettuce. No wonder it was only $5. The pork on one side lacked taste. Overall, 3/5. Decent but not good. Still trying to find the perfect fresh lumpia.",

It's enough for 2 hungry people. Also, the beef fried rice (exactly what I get) has the beef very thinly sliced and just absolutely incredible. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

The serving is pretty much the same but the prices are probably $1 more than the other places around town, BUT it's worth it since it is much better tasting and much better quality food than the ones in Chinatown.   I've never actually sat here and dined because I always ordered takeout instead, but the owner and his employees are super generous and they make you feel welcome right when you come into the store. They basically welcome you with a smile! Again, unlike the other pho places I've been to. In this restaurant, they're here to make sure you're a happy customer.   Big plus: I don't have to drive aaaaalllllllll the way to Chinatown just to eat some alright tasting pho, but instead I can take a five minute drive to Viet Bistro!   Only downside to this place is that there's a cigar place next door and you can really smell the stench of the cigars once you enter the restaurant :(  Other than that, great food, amazing service. You MUST drop in here and try Viet Bistro out!",

It was quite tasty, however watch out for the splashes because the stains can scare you if you are wearing light colored clothing! I also ordered shrimp spring rolls for my appetizer which was refreshing and not too heavy.   The only drawback of this place is the smoke smell from the cigar store next to the restaurant. I would also suggest revamping or remodeling the interior to bring in more traffic. These are a few of the reasons for my 4 star. Other than that friendly service and welcoming staff. Happy eating!",

    "text": "I grew up eating Vietnamese food, so I can taste the difference between good and bad bun bo hue.  The main reasons why I gave this place a one star was because:  1. The service was terrible. I was not greeted at the door or at the table until I got someone's attention 10 minutes later. Yes I did sit myself because I thought that was the norm, and yes I came in during business hours. Maybe they were playing hide-and-go seek with me. Who knows.   2. Perhaps they were trying to be hip, but the room was really dark... The only bright light came from the kitchen.   3. All the items on the menu were quite pricey compared to the Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown   4. I ordered the bun bo hue and received a few pieces of meat, noodle, soup, and bean sprouts. Keep in mind that bun bo hue should have banana root/blossom or at least red cabbage on the side, beef shank, pig's feet and pig's blood cubes inside the the soup.  You are better off making 10 cent ramen at home. If you want good Vietnamese food, go to Chinatown.",

I always get veggie tofu and he got beef and shrimp in spicy peanut butter broth. Mine was really good. Firm tofu the broth was super good and close to pho citis broth that I was obsessed w in LA. I was really happy with it. My boyfriends was sooooo good the broth is spicy so beware. But the peanut butter really came through. And 7 shrimps in there! Surprising. My boyfriend who is a chef said few things while be was eating but one of them.was, \"this is the real deal!\" I enjoyed the atmosphere of the light and dark purples. We got a ginger lemonade iced tea w mint! Yummmmm ! Really really good.",

Atmosphere: the restaurant is pretty big. It could fit quite a bit of people. The waitress was really nice and patient while we decided what we wanted to eat.  My friend decided to try the Vietnamese sandwich. We both used to live in San Francisco so we had high expectations. The sandwich was definitely sub par. There was nothing great about it. The bread wasn't nicely toasted and the meats didn't quite work on it. It wasn't memorable whatsoever.   The BBQ vermicelli bowl on the other hand was delicious! I decided to get the bowl with the imperial rolls. It was delicious! It was very flavorful and tasted so much better than the sandwich and definitely made up for it. I would have given this place a 3.5 stars since the bowl made up for the sandwich!",

The wings weren't seasoned and only glazed on the outside.  When you bit into the chicken, it was just dry with not much flavor.  They should season the wings before they fry it, then add the glaze.  I wouldn't order these again.  I had the Lemon Grass Chicken and substituted rice for vermicelli.  The lemon grass chicken wasn't bold enough but I liked the taste of the onions.  My friend ordered the Combination Vermicelli bowl with pork, shrimp, and meatballs.  This was definitely the best dish we ordered but anything on Spring Mtn is better.  They do have Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef), Banh Mi sandwiches, and a wide array of Pho.   Based on the items we ordered, it's average compared to Viet eateries in Spring Mountain but is a decent option for those who live in the West Lake Mead area.    Since I don't live in the area, I probably won't make an effort to make it back, but it was average.    The service was really nice, atmosphere is good, and  you can always hit up the Cupcakery for dessert afterwards.",

We came for dinner on opening day, and the staff was the friendliest and attentive bunch...it was their grand opening after all.   The menu has so many items that you don't see at a typical Vietnamese restaurant, and that alone will have me coming back.  But, we were there to try our usuals: Dac Biet, Bun, and Imperial Rolls.    (Shredded pork spring rolls and Soda Chanh are usually included on our list of regulars, but sadly- they didn't offer it on their menu.)    The Dac Biet (Combination Pho) was average in my opinion.  My gold standard is the broth at Golden Deli in San Gabriel, CA.  It was good, but something was missing.  And looking back, I don't recall it having any tendon pieces, and the cilantro was minimal.  The meat serving was also not as plentiful one would expect for $8.50/ bowl.   The Bun (Rice noodles with grilled shrimp and sliced pork) on the other hand, is a dish I will return for.  The veggies were fresh and plentiful, and the special sauce was delicious. Definitely worth the $8.50.   The Imperial Rolls were also good, but again not the best I have ever tried. Since they didn't offer Soda Chanh, I ordered a Ginger Iced Tea Lemonade instead.  Unlike the previous reviewer, the ginger flavor was definitely overpowering and the drink was really sweet.    Nonetheless, the rest of the menu is VERY intriguing- I will definitely be back to try one of those!! And you can bet, I'll back before the 20% off promotion ends on May 31st.",

We about threw up (and we are all RNs so you know it takes a lot to make us feel sick). When we brought it to the attention of the manager, she told us that what we thought were bugs were actually spices they use in the soup. she brought out a container of the spice and it didn't look anything like the bugs. To give you more detail, in one bowl of pho, we found the head and the body (separated from each other) of a beetle. You cant mistake that for a spice. As long as you have eyes you can tell the difference. Anyway, we won't be back. If you decide to take a risk and eat there I would just look at each bite very carefully before you eat it.",

An independently owned ethnic restaurant in the middle of a chain/franchise restaurant filled strip center???  Viet Bistro has good food and service, and it sure beats driving to Chinatown for my regular go-to spot for pho, Pho So 1.  Viet Bistro is pricier but I'm sure rent in this plaza is not cheap.  Their egg rolls and shrimp fresh rolls are excellent.  I've ordered their grilled pork vermicelli noodles and its outstanding.  I've also ordered that to go and they package it up nicely.  My wife loves their Hue Spicy Noodle soup.  I'm afraid to try it because it looks so spicy...almost like flames simmering in the broth!!!  The one thing I don't care for is unfortunately the one item on a Vietnamese menu that usually defines the restaurant - the Pho.  Whenever I eat pho at restaurants I order the brisket & well-done flank.  I've probably had this dish in a dozen+ restaurants.  At Viet Bistro, I find the beef to be too thick and tough to chew.   However, Viet Bistro does offer something I've never seen before - Filet Mignon Pho. Wow!!!  Delicious thin slices of filet but pricey at $11.  Overall nice to see this restaurant do well in our neighborhood!",

Their Pho and spring rolls are my favorite, but I also love their shaken beef! Always busy which shows how great this place is. And the servers have all been top notch:) give this place a A+",

The flavors of the meat were great really hit the spot.  The only drawback I have is that I would like more meat and the carrot/onion mixture I like a lot more vinegar flavor in.  So Ill be back real soon just wondering if they will give me some Pho with nothing but tendon in it, am I the only one who likes tendon more than the other meats.",

    "text": "I've never tried Vietnamese in my life, and I always passd Viet Bistro when coming to grab some cigars at the shop next door. I finally decided to try it.   And it was amazing. I had the sheking beef. Unbelievable. Literally the best asian food I've ever had. The dish came with a sizzling skillet of teh beef with onions and other spices in it, and some rice. It was $12, but the food was fantastic adn the serving was pretty healthy. I was stuffed.   I've noticed some complaints about the smell in side with the cigar shop next door. being a cigar smoker I can instantly pick up on the smell when it's in the air and I did not notice it much in the resturant. Certainly nothing compared to inside the cigar shop. Perhaps some folks just have more sensitive noses. If it does bother you, then I still reccomend take out.   I will be visiting again and again.",

Minus points for the business hours on yelp not being accurate. When I rolled up at 8:55pm one night, the worker yells at me that they are closing in five minutes. On my way out, I tell her that her Yelp page says they close at 10:00pm, she kinda just shrugs it off lol",

So if you don't like those flavors, I wouldn't recommend ordering this, as these are quite predominant. We also ordered fried won-tons with sweet chili sauce and pork spring rolls for an appetizer. Both were delicious.  I will come here again and try something new.",
