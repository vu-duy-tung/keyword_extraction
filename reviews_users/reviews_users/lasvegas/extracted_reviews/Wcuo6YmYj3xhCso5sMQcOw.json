I chose the white pizza that had arugula , bacon and cheese, I added basil. It's a thin crust pizza and pretty tasty, except mine was a little burnt, but ok not complaining - it was free! I would definitely come back, prices are fair! Looking for something different, give this a try! They will have a NLV location in the future. The only cons that I see.. and maybe cause it was opening night, very noisy- make sure your loud voice works! And also  their were so many people back their running around and the fire guy constantly yelling HOT!! And bringing that blazin' hot pizza out- that has accident written all over it. But that's the nurse in me  Be Careful!",

Blaze Pizza was fast and efficient. Came here during a busy lunch hour rush and still it only took a few minutes from ordering to eating. It looked like a assembly line with a number of employees behind the counter, everyone knowing their part, and doing it right. Friendly service.  As for the food it's a thin crust pizza, not my preferred crust, made for one person or two depending how much pizza you can eat. Yea yea I know I probably could do more than a few on my own if I really wanted to. They have various signature pizzas you can select from like a Meat Eater, Art Lover, Green Stripe, etc. Or you can customize your pizza with the wide variety of different toppings they have available. It's like Subway start with your base stuff, side step to the left or right, either have them add what's in front of you or not, take another side step, and continue down the line or until they cut you off. Obviously I like to customize the hell out of things when I get the chance especially if you can add as many of the toppings as you want. Just dont get carried away cause it might take longer to cook. I just pointed and that and that and that and that. It came out cooked throughout nothing over or under cooked. You must add SPICY RED SAUCE. I don't really know why but I can taste it in my mouth right now. It's probably nothing special but I just love things with a little spice in it.   In and out like that. I'd be back.",

    "text": "First of all, I was VERY impressed. I wasn't expecting that reaction when I visited on 3/14 for their Pi Day promotion ($3.14/pizza).  My brother and I arrived before opening (I thought they opened at 10:30) and once a line formed, we finally got out to join everyone. Fortunately, we didn't wait very long.  First, you tell them what kind of pizza you want - if you're building your own or getting one of their Signature Pizzas and they write this with your name on wax paper that will end up under your very own pizza. Second, you move down the line and choose toppings. In order: Sauce, cheese, meat, vegetables, and finishes.   The best part? You can choose as many toppings as you want! All for one price: $7.95. And they do not skimp on the toppings. Yeah, so awesome.  I opted for the \"Art Lover\" (artichoke, mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, and red sauce dollops) and added meatball, chicken breast, roasted red peppers, fresh basil, oregano, and sea salt. I loved the care that each employee showed the ingredients and how it was placed on the pie, even though they were slammed with customers. (The care shows with how beautiful the pizza looks in photos)  The most important thing is that my pie was DELICIOUS. Really freaking great. The taste was perfection and I love their thin crust.  Other things to note: Pizzas are done in three minutes. So, even if it's busy, you're getting your food fast. I haven't found literature on official Blaze websites to cite the size, but I've read that it's 11-inches. I can eat quite a bit and I couldn't finish the whole pie.",

I have never been to a restaurant that I can think of that had such amazing customer service. We interacted with atleast 5 and each person was as kind as the last. Truly made us feel welcomed and happy. Now the good part... the food! Tried multiple different pizzas and even the knots. We got great instructions and all of us agreed we would get the same ones again! Looking to make this our pizza stop. Thank you guys. Not just food but a fun place.",

    "text": "Today is Pi day and blaze pizza is the only build your own pizza place out of pieology and pizza rev that had a good promo, $3.14 for a pizza limit one per customer.   I arrived at 2:25 and the line was out the door. It took me about an hour to place my order and pay. Lines were out the door the entire morning but workers were still friendly despite the chaos and some grouchy customers. I overheard a worker saying they're estimated to sell about 2500 pizzas... That's insane! Of course the pizza assembly line was also crazy, toppings were being thrown onto the pizzas and some spilled on the counters and floors but the workers did a great job.   If you haven't been to blaze before, I believe the pizzas are $7.95. They have a few pizzas that you can choose from or you can build your own. They have gluten free pizzas as well as salads and dessert. You can add whatever you want... Meat toppings include salami, meatball, Italian sausage, pepperoni and chicken. Cheeses include mozzarella, Goat cheese, Gorgonzola, Parmesan, feta, ricotta. Veggies: artichoke hearts, mushroom, onion, bell peppers, olives, spinach, fresh basil, oregano, garlic, tomatoes... And more. They also have toppings that are put on at the very end, which include pesto sauce, bbq sauce, arugula (my favorite!!) and ranch (on the side).   Lines here move fast... If customers know what they want! It only takes about 5 minutes for pizzas to finish cooking once in the oven. Pizzas are a good size, they're thin crust though. I finished half for lunch and saved half for dinner.",

The staff is completely untrained and eating here is nothing short of painstaking. I've been standing here for 35 minutes because they had to remake my pizza (like they do almost every time I come here). I give explicit instructions as to how to avoid cross contact (using the designated pizza cutters, changing gloves, etc) but it appears as though this business either hires the least intelligent people they can find standing on the road, or they put little to no effort into informing the staff on how to correctly use the equipment. Disappointed at best",

It is like chipotle/subway meets pizza. I mean customized pizza for about $8. Doesnt get better. They have the thin crust pizza that I love as well as my hubby. Also they had gluten free options for my friends that are gluten intolerant.  Multiple base options to choose from: Meat lovers, Pesto, green pizza. And the best is the make your own. Sauces range from original red, to white alfredo to olive oil, to spicy sauce which my mexican friends loved. Also the cheese options are stupendous: Vegan cheese, blue cheese, mozerella, Goat cheese, ricotta and so many more. Also Meat options are one of the many options of UNLIMITED toppings! Sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, ham, salami, pretty much every topping you can think of. And then the other veggie options keep me even more happy: Whole roasted garlic is by far one of my favorites.  The location is clean and the service is beyond my expectations. It kind of reminded me of going to Chick-afil where the people come around and asked you for drink refills, sauce refills, clean your table, etc.  I love love love this place and is def my go to for pizza. I will be bringing more of my friends who visit here. Also they have these cute boxes for to go. Amazing PIZZA and all to your own liking. Doesnt get better.",

Sometimes when they make the pizza they can get a little sloppy, but that would be my only complaint. Overall though, lot of love for the fast fired pizza. 4.5/5",

One person pizza style that you can \"build-ur-own\" or order from menu board...with only one size!  I ordered the cheese and the other - the pepperoni and a salad of tomato, mozzarella and balsamic dressing....it was bad Cardboard tasting crust and the salad was small and wimpy...:(((  Good thing was that they were accommodating and helpful so nice service saved this place from being and disastrous experience but man, this is bad pizza and I cannot believe that it's a restaurant chain with other locations....:/....never again and I hope people get smart and support the \"family owned\" pizza joints....!!!!",

    "text": "Can a transplanted New Yorker pizza snob (now a vegan) find a good pie outside the Big Apple? The answer is YES!  The topping choices for Blaze's vegan pizza are wonderful: spinach, roasted (or minced) garlic, red onions, roasted bell peppers, yellow peppers, oregano, basil leaf, cherry tomatoes, vegan cheese, tofu, and more!  I've gotten takeout 4 times from Blaze since moving to Vegas from NY 3 months ago. In addition to the high quality of the ingredients, the kids (hey, I'm 51. They're all my son's age) behind the counter are enthusiastic, respectful, responsive, kind and good at their jobs.  Kudos to the management team at the Eastern Ave location. You've set a great tone with your leadership style. Keep it up! And a special tip of the hat to all the young workers there. Bravo for making it such a terrific place  for every customer that walks in there. I will definitely be back!",

What's great about this set up is that its easy to navigate the ordering process(choose one of their signature pies or create your own) Price point is very reasonable, and portions are perfect.  I went with their signature White Top Pizza and for dessert, we tried their S'mores Pie which is basically a cookie sandwich, but a pretty damn good one! Have them set it by the oven so it gets all warm and gooey(bet you want one now, huh?) My pizza was good, but I still prefer a white pizza without using alfredo sauce...S'mores Pie was a pefect ending, and it was great that the staff continually checked on all guests and even bussed a few tables.  Quick, efficient, tasty, and doesn't break the bank at all...its also a great option if you have a bunch of kids in tow. ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  5",

Very thin, very tough. The white was the high rise dough and there is barely a difference. The high rise pizza had a bit more crust around the pizza but was still thin. Both pizzas were tough and lacking in a general sense. Based on all the high reviews I was expecting so much more. The pizzas were nothing special and made me wish we had just ordered from our normal pizza place.",

    "text": "Pizza is one of my favorite food groups and the pizza served here did not disappoint!!!   The sauce, the cheese, the crust and the toppings were perfect!  I love that you can choose your sauce, either white, spicy tomato, or original tomato sauce.  I chose pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, ricotta, mozzarella and original sauce.   The only thing I would suggest is perhaps brushing olive oil or a healthier option than the canned spray they were using.   Once your creation goes in the open oven, your wait is short which I was happy about because I could not wait to dig in.     It was as delicious as it smelled right up to the last bite.  I will say the only thing I will request on my next visit is for the pizza to be left in the oven for about 3 minutes longer only because I would like the veggies on top to be browned a little bit more, but other than that it was perfect!    The topping selections are awesome and I love that they are not at an extra cost, which allows you to try different pizza creations without indecision.   For dessert I ordered their s'mores.  The cookie they use for their s'mores is not your typical graham cracker, but was better along with the gooey marshmallow and chocolate center Mmmm perfect.  They placed it in the oven and this ended the perfect dining experience.    The place itself is very nice, clean and welcoming with both indoor and outdoor dining options.   The service was a bit spotty so I look forward to checking out some of their other locations to compare.    Great pizza and good looking salads which I will try next time!",

    "text": "UPDATE: 1/19/17  After I left my original review, I was contacted by the management of Blaze. They offer their apology for the service and invited us back to try their food again. We excepted their offer, and have since been back twice. The first time, it was much less busy and we didn't have any problems ordering, however, my pizza was extremely well done around the edges and I wasn't too pleased. That being said, the next time we went back, the pizza was absolutely perfect, but this time we had a little trouble during the ordering process similar to the kind mentioned in my original review. The more times we go here, the more I get to observe the workers and I realize a lot of what throws off the service is the number of online orders they've gotten in. The restaurant may look empty but there may be 15 online orders or vice versa. So, while the food is good, I still have to say that the service is somewhat inconsistent. They employees are very nice for the most part, but you have to keep an eye on them or they tend to get distracted and make mistakes. However, That is a small price to pay for the deliciousness of their pizza.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: We went here for dinner last night because we just recently moved nearby. We love other Blaze locations and we're excited to try this one out. Unfortunately we had a terrible experience and I think we'll stick to the Henderson location.  While we were going through the line to order, the staff was in complete chaos. They kept switching back and forth between roles and as a result the line was at a standstill. The staff kept sliding my pizza along the counter before I actually got to the point where I could see what ingredients I wanted on it. At that point the staff switched roles again and the guy that came to take over put my pizza on the rack to go in the oven with nothing but ham on it. I hadn't even gotten to the veggies yet. When I told him I wasn't done yet, he rolled his eyes and asked what else I wanted. I told him I literally couldn't see because the line was so long I was stuck back by the cheeses. Cue another eye roll.  Eventually we finally got the pizza straightened out and we moved onto the cashier. I told her I wanted to use my Blaze membership and she told me to bring it up. I scanned it but nothing seemed to happen. I asked her if it worked and she said yes, to refresh my app and it would show up. She was clearly in a hurry and didn't care so I had my doubts but I went along with it. She then tried to rushed us off before she remembered to get our drink. When we reminded her, she seemed annoyed I would dare ask for the drink I paid for.  So I go try to find a place to sit down. There are about four empty tables, three of which are dirty. I find the last clean table and sit down to refresh the app. Lo and behold, the scan didn't work (just as I'd thought) but once again I shrugged it off.  The last straw came with our pizza. When my pizza came out it was absolutely smothered in pesto. Luckily I like pesto, but more importantly, I didn't ask for it. But when I bit into it, it was barely cooked. At this point I was so mad, I just wanted to leave. I knew if I asked the staff to fix it, I would just get more attitude or annoyance from them so we just left. Date night = ruined. Like I said, we won't be coming back to this location.",

    "text": "(Disclaimer again: latest visit was during the widely publicized Pi Day promo, with $3.14 pizzas.)  After trying multiple similar \"build your own pizza\" concepts, Blaze Pizza easily remains my favorite.  Other pizzas from Chipotle-esque pizzerias tend to be smaller and not as delicious. Their crusts may be the same diameter or just slightly smaller than Blaze's, but some just are really thin. I just noticed tonight that Blaze's crust is thicker on the end, which I'm sure helps to corral the toppings on potentially massive orders.  That's right, they don't skimp at Blaze Pizza. I've loaded up on toppings at competitors in a similar fashion, but the end results were simply not as big. Although Blaze doesn't have everything, their competitors generally seem to have less interesting toppings. Notable standouts at Blaze include the ovalini mozzarella and goat cheeses, and both roasted and chopped garlic. That aside, all the toppings collectively punch my taste buds harder, and on a consistent basis at that.  They still tend to rush you a bit through the pizza line when it's busy. Just order quickly and clearly, and get all the toppings that you want. Take note that there are a few toppings that are duplicated within the creation line (Italian sausage and pepperoni come to mind), so you'll have a second chance at them just in case you miss them.  I usually craft an order similar to the one detailed in my first review, but I've been meaning to spice it up. I literally did that tonight by asking for the spicy red sauce instead of the regular red sauce. I think it definitely added some flavor while thankfully not providing too much heat. I also omitted cherry tomatoes because of another experience where I thought that the flavors might have been diluted by the juicy tomato slices. Tonight's result showed me that, at the very least, I didn't miss those tomatoes one bit.  I made another awesome observation tonight. Gregg W. mentioned in his review that he requested his own massive construct to be cooked in the oven for longer. The crust on my pizza tonight was firm all the way to the middle, not soggy as I noted in my first review. I think I know why: they adjusted the cooking time on their own. My pizza came out _after_ my friend's, even though he'd been behind me in line the whole time (and yes, his pizza was more modestly decorated). I was leaning toward the five stars anyway due to multiple consistently delicious visits, but this attention to detail sealed the deal.  Misc. notes: they have an app (available on both Android and iOS) that lets you gain rewards. They have online ordering and don't bake those pizzas until you arrive to pick them up. Estimated calorie counts have recently been added to printed menus, in addition to being available on their web site (Nutrition Calculator, under Menu).  Although I haven't completely explored this sub-genre of pizza, I'm not sure what it would take for me to find a new favorite. I've found that the bar for quantity, quality, and service set by Blaze Pizza is very high. I've heard that they're planning to open another location even closer to me, and I'm waiting eagerly. Ecstatically, even.",

Blood orange lemonade was so refreshing and they offer some specialty beverages too. Caesar salad was fresh and we had chocolate chip cookies warmed up for us while we ate our pizza.   Sat at a table and a worker brought us a high chair for our son and napkins without us even having to ask. Food was great and service was on point.

So many options here, but I'm sure it's hard to make a bad pie. I went for gold with all of my favorite toppings. Idk if I was tripping, but they have some of the loveliest ricotta I've ever had in my life! Pizza was delicious and it was hard to stop at just half.  Went for the blood orange lemonade, but I wish it were a little more blood-orangey. Still a nice, sweet refresher to wash it all down with, so nobody's losing stars over it.  I'll surely be back again and again to try more combos.",

    "text": "Horrible experience at blaze. The pizza place where your pizza is supposed to be fast fired. I waited over 10 minutes to get my pizza as the young lady dispersing the pizzas decided she would fill the order of the guy behind me who had a number of pizzas while mine sat getting cold. The young lady instead of serving the pizzas in the order the trays were stacked she decided to serve in the middle of the stacked trays to complete his order when my tray was next to be served. Unacceptable. Speaking with the manager on duty he advised that she is training. I explained her decision to serve the pizzas out of order was not a lack of training issue. She specifically pulled the trays as the customer was advising her which ones belonged to his order. Instead of serving the pizzas in the order they were sold in. I paid with a debit card requested a refund and to add insult to injury I'm told I cannot have cash back I now have to wait until the reverse charge clears my bank in 3 days. Horrible service all around at blaze. Tip for manager: instead of defending the poor service apologize instead to diffuse the situation and find out what you can do to change the experience if possible. I frequented blaze nearly everyday when I moved to Nevada 4 years ago. I don't go as often now with the endless options for food. This experience unfortunately will end my patronage at blaze.",

The first one comes out and it's great as always. The second one comes out and it's a little burnt on one end. Not that big of a deal. The man working the pan says \"oh no, i'll give you a good one, we'll remake it. The burned one is on the house\". I got to talking with the gentlemen and his co-worker and they were the nicest guys (I was having a bit of a rough day too). Their names were Pierce and Mark. I told them I would go on yelp to say they were \"absolute ballers\" and here I am. I go back just to see them. Grade A",

It's still new, so in time I think they'll find their groove.",

We ordered one of their signature pizzas and then a build your own. Overall tasted good.  Personally I like the sauce to have a richer tomato taste, and I thought the pepperoni was salty.  The fact that you can create your own, right in front of you is a great concept and its quick.. just 3 minutes in the oven. I'm sure we will be back soon. Especially when the weather cools down and can enjoy dining on their patio.",

    "text": "I ordered an Art Lover (artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, red sauce dollops) on gluten-free crust. The artichokes were mostly likely canned because they were briny and vinegary. However, they gave the pizza brininess which gave it the pleasant flavor of olives.  The cheeses were extremely creamy and fatty (which is never a bad thing) so it gave the pizza the salty aftertaste I was longing for.  These toppings were generously put on top of a gluten-free dough. Because the dough was free of gluten, it was crispier than the regular pizza dough. PIZZA ORDERING TIP: If you enjoy New York style pizza, order the gluten-free crust. But if you enjoy Chicago style, order the dough with gluten.  Tomato sauce was dolloped on the pizza before heading to the 600 degree oven. The sauce was a little bland; lacking traditional seasonings such as oregano, basil, and garlic. However, the flavor of the toppings made up for the flavor of the sauce. Blaze Pizza is an amazing restaurant to go to if you want Italy meets modern America style pizza.",

Keep in mind though that the crust is VERY thin, so the more toppings you put on the less firm the slice is when you go to eat it. Great variety of toppings and fast service.

They have a good variety of cheeses but unless you get the mozzarella they put very little cheese on the pizza.  The pizza really needed more cheese to offset the acidity of the sauce.  Also the air conditioning was way too cold. Bring a sweater.  Good pizza just not my favorite.",

As everyone else has said, it is very similar to Chipotle and Subway as you can really customize your own pizza. And you can't beat the price. In my house, this is especially appealing as no one can ever agree on what kind of pizza they want.   The staff is very friendly. My husbands pizza got a little burned on one side and they quickly offered to make him a new one. I was very grateful, as there was no way he was going to eat it in the state the first one was in.   I was a little disappointed that they only have one size pizza. I feel like they should have some sizing options. Or at least a kid size one. I know my little one did not even get close to eating even half of the pizza she got, so a kids size option would be amazing.  Overall, it's a pretty solid place and the food wasn't half bad.",

The taste reminds me of Grimaldi's without the wait and restaurant atmosphere. The only reason it doesn't get five stars because the place is so small! You really have to fight for a table if you're dining in. There's nothing they can do about that and awesome for them that business is that good. But it's still a royal pain, especially if you're dining in during your lunch break from work. With that being said, I will be a repeat offender. The pizza is just too darn good not to deal with the seating issue. Awesomeness!",

We showed up about half an hour before they were closing, the David Copperfield show ended later than we thought, which almost kept us from going. I don't like going to restaurants when they are that close to closing due to the fact they usually are starting the tear down, Which means  ingredients that are not fresh. BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH BLAZE. EVERYTHING WAS FRESH. THE ATMOSPHERE IS CASUAL AND CLEAN. THE EMPLOYEES GREATED US (ALL 8) WITH A SMILE AND WERE VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE MENU.

In addition to glove changes and covering work areas, Blaze has a bin of sauce dedicated to GF pies. Short of a dedicated gluten free kitchen, there's not much more they could do! Fast, yummy, and cheap. Check them out! (or don't, because the lines get long and i don't want to wait) ;)",

    "text": "It was Sunday evening when my family and friends decided to try this place out. It was our very first time experiencing the fast, custom, chipotle - style pizzeria. I must say that my family and I were very impressed.   We arranged the tables in the patio to accomodate our large party. We were not able to fit inside because seating was limited for larger parties. The inside was not as large as I hoped. However, the patio was able to accommodate us easily. We had 15 people with us. Thankfully it was a beautiful evening.   Although the line was long, we undestood that patience was required for custom deliciousness. We are a family of five,one is a baby, so we ordered four pizzas.   First you pick your crust: you can get the thin crust, a double crust (which is two crusts made into one), or a gluten free crust. Then you pick the sauce, I opted for the classic red with garlic pesto. Next is the cheeses, I added mozzarella and fresh olavine mozzarella. Finally the toppings. They have almost any topping you can imagine. The best part is that it is all included in the price, which means that you can add as little or as many topping as you like. Want to double up on meat? No problem, just let them know you want more! I also added fresh arugula on top of my finshed, fast-fired pizza. By the time I paid and got my beverage from the self serve beverage station, the pizzas were ready to pick up.   My husband, the kids, and myself devoured our pizzas! I loved the thin crust and the fresh ingredients. The crust surpisingly can hold up to the toppings. What is even better is that it was completely tailored to each of our tastes because we designed our own pizzas. There was nothing left to take home, not even the crust!  I'm even thinking about going back again this week. For our family to have dinner for under $40 and be completely satisfied is a rare occasion. We will definitely be coming back again, again and again.  I'd also like to note the BLOOD ORANGE LEMONADE was a family favorite! Yum.",

The salad said \"made fresh daily\" which I believe..but walking in at 6:30pm it looked like they had made it that morning and it was sitting there all day. The gluten free pizza was good..however, all made in same oven as regular crusts and is definitely contaminated with gluten so if you have a severe allergy, not a good place to go. We ordered a \"two portion\" salad and it was really small. Price wise it was decent considering it was a GF crust. About $15 for pizza + salad. Not quite the environment you'd want to dine out in unless you're a child or teenager..totally great place for kids!",

    "text": "I enjoy the Pizza at Blaze, but their process is flawed. If you order there you will probably be ok, where things fall apart is online ordering.  First it always feels awkward to go to the end of the line to pickup your order, but at least they've added a sign to let you know where to go now.  If you get there after your pizza was made they may or may not call your name and your pizza will sit there. They may realize you are there or they may not. The person cutting the pizzas is a bit robotic, they cut pizzas and calls names. If you ask anything else they will just look at you confused.  On my recent visit one of my pizzas was ready and sitting on the ledge. I let them know I arrived and that only 1 of my 2 pizzas was on the ledge. They said the other would be out shortly, 10+ minutes went by, nothing appeared. I decided to speak to the person at the register because like I said before the final person just cuts and calls names. At the register they were confused and looked around, the pizza wasn't there. I guess it was lost or someone else picked it up. So they said we will make another one for you. I waited another bit for them to make a new pizza.  Here's the fun part, it wasn't correct. At this point I decided to just deal with it, I didn't tell them it was wrong and left. They didn't seem to care anyways. My first pizza had been sitting there for 15 to 20 minutes and was totally cold.  I understand things happen and I can see there's a quick pace and it's not the easiest job.     Unfortunately something like this has happened on my last 3 visits.  I would recommend eating in over ordering takeout.",

Today, a total by man named Lucas, made 2 pies for me..  he was exceptional when it came to customer service and patience! He crafted THE perfect blended pizza of cheese and sauce.. he ASKED me \" does your pizza look alright?\" Before firing it up..  He was kind, soft spoken and very precise.. someone needs to give this hard working young man a raise!! I was so impressed.. thank you Lucas!!",

Building your own pizza with them is fun and no limits. You can explore everything you want to for one price. No additional topping cost while i Love because I'm a supreme kind of girl but always with the EXTRAS lol!!!  Their pizza tastes really fresh and it's not over cooked or undercooked. It's so perfect. I mean i put extra cheese on it and wasn't charged. Anybody who loves cheese like i do understand how important this can be aha. Extra cheese without paying another dollar or change is amazing. I rather eat this pizza than those nasty ass chain restaurants.",

Like many other people I do think that a pizza with a bunch of toppings for under 10 bucks is a good deal, but mostly when I love it.  Here I didn't love it.  On pi day they had a nice 3.14 pizza promotion, maybe i should have come that day. As a three dollar pizza this place would be great, but as a ten dollar pizza joint its just average. I did like that they had some type of beer selection to go with your pizza.  At least that one ups dominos since they dont serve alcohol. The sauce is bland, the dough is tasteless and the thinness of the pizza makes it soggy with multiple toppings.  If you have no pizza standards this can easily be a go to place for someone working or living nearby on a budget. But why would you choose average pizza with better quality options on the same street for a similar or lower price? I wouldnt, but thats me.   The location is on eastern so it gets a lot of food traffic and car traffic, waits here can be a while at lunch time too.  Overall, not a bad place for a quick pizza lunch but no where near the best,  If youre in the area for the weekend go elsewhere.",

The pizza is a great value. 8 bucks for as many toppings as you like on an 11 inch pizza is a great deal anywhere, but here its a steal. The toppings are quality and fresh. Combined with the wood fire cooking, it really makes for a tasty pizza. On top of it all, you'll be eating within minutes of ordering.   The staff is always friendly and appear to be genuine, which goes a long way for a pleasant experience. The place jumps and I've been here during lunch and dinner rushes and the staff manages to handle things well while maintaining positive, warm attitudes. It truly is nice to see a well-staffed restaurant, while so many others try to handle the same amount of customers with half the staff.  All in all, big thumbs up to this place and I'm happy to welcome them to the neighborhood.",

    "text": "Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza is a chain that already has locations in about 11 US states, and looks to be rapidly expanding to about 15 more US states and Canadian provinces.  This is the first LV Valley location (another is coming soon).  I would compare the process to the Chipotle or Subway experience, but for pizza.  All pies are 11\" personal size, thin crust, and $7.65 regardless of # of toppings.  You go down a line and first choose your crust: regular or gluten-free. Note: They do advise that they don't use a separate oven or dough press, so if you are highly sensitive to gluten, you may want to use caution if you eat here.    Then you choose one of their 8 signature pizzas or to build your own (choose sauce type, cheeses, meats, & veggies).  Once your pizza is built, it is fired for three minutes, cut and brought to you.  They also have salads, s'mores, soda, lemonade, & iced tea.  This location also has beer & wine.  However, I would consider this more of a lunch place than a dinner place.  I enjoyed my ham, spinach, tomato, & garlic pie.  The sauce was good and all the toppings were fresh.  The crust was crispy, but lacked flavor and was very thin.  It was the let me down for me.    All in all, I would visit again for a quick, inexpensive lunch.  It was not the best pizza I've ever had, but I don't think that's their schtick.",

Tonight, I found a hair laying on my pizza about an inch long. Lol, yup no more Blazed Pizza for me.  Lastly, the worker who made my pizza had gloves on covered in pesto oil..

Subway style method, where they ask what type of dough, sauces, meats, veggies, etc. You're charged at a fixed price when you build your own, so toppings are unlimited with no additional charge! No need to shy away from requesting extra of anything. TIP: Ask for ricotta, and extra at that (yummy, white cheesy dollops).  I fully recommend Blaze if you need a quick, cheap fix to a pizza craving. Modern/hip ambiance, fresh ingredients, efficient and enthusiastic customer service!

    "text": "Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza's slogan is \"intelligent choices for our pizzas, people, and planet\" and fast-fired. Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza (abbreviated Blaze Pizza) would be an intelligent choice for lunch before Bad Owl Cafe.      Blaze Pizza is relatively new to the fast-casual dining landscape. The original Pasadena shop opened a few years ago in 2011. From Pasadena, California; Blaze Pizza is expanding across the Nation winning people over. One of the places Blaze Pizza has expanded to is the Las Vegas Valley. This very location at the northeast corner of Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the former Sweet Tomatoes Express is the second location in the Las Vegas market.     When I walked inside, I took in a contemporary urban interior incorporating stainless steel and reclaimed wood. I also took in the long counter and oven. Blaze is a custom built pizza chain. As a matter of fact the name \"blaze\"  means how quickly the customer can create their own custom built fast fired pizza. The heart of the Blaze assembly line operation is the pizza oven. This pizza oven in 800 degrees hot. This burning hot temperature makes the custom built pizza in three minutes (give and take). The first thing I did was chose the 11 inch custom pizza I wanted. Decisions! Decisions! There are at least forty toppings to chose from.  I'd take a short cut by choosing from one of the signature pizza's for $8. I chose the veg out pizza pie. This included zucchini, mushrooms (my favorite pizza topping), red onion, mozzarella, red sauce, and dollops. The neat thing about Blaze is that nothing with the custom built pizza is set in stone. On top of the veg all pizza, I added meatballs and bacon. Another neat thing about Blaze is their dough process. Their dough is made individually at each restaurant before it is fermented for 24 hours. In a glance the assembly line process goes like this: 1. Order, give your name and pay for the pizza. 2. Create the pizza if it is not strictly a signature pie. 3. Wait an expected three minutes. 4. Enjoy the custom built pizza.       There is sufficient tables including indoor and patio seating. On a serene Vegas afternoon, I sat in the patio overlooking Eastern Avenue. My eyes were on the pizza. With the pizza pie, I enjoyed bottomless fountain Coke that brought the price of lunch to $10.25. Near the Coke (not Freestyle) machine, I added pepper to my creation and grabbed a plastic fork and knife to enjoy the overflowing toppings.      It seems that many of us in the Las Vegas valley agree that Blaze Pizza is an intelligent choice. There are so many combinations of creating the 11 inch pie that no visit is the same. The price is reasonable. The pizza is delicious. The upshots are that they just opened a store by the Galleria Mall at Henderson, and they initiated a niche for custom built pizza with Pizza Rev also going strong in the market. Blaze Pizza really is an intelligent choice for custom built pizza.",

They have vegan options which adds extra points for me! The staff even made sure to change their gloves when handling my pizza once I asked for vegan cheese. They also have vegan 'chicken' and a ton of veggie options. Service was fast and friendly. I will be going back!",

I recommend the build your own option! they have sooo many options to choose from on the line and then some more at the end before they box it up for ya! the employees were all nice and friendly. the pizza was pretty tasty! i really enjoyed all the options! I'll definitely go here again if I'm looking for some yummy and inexpensive pizza!",

    "text": "We've been to this place twice. Pizza is great. It's quick and it's cheap. Ingredients are great. There are just a few things I hope that are just kinks that need worked out as they are a new location. I've never been to any other Blaze's so I don't know if this is how they run all of them but here are my concerns.  When you walk in, it is a little overwhelming, the amount of employees talking to you. There were about 5-6 people in the place and 15 employees to serve us, each eager to put one ingredient on my pizza. It's weird.  Also I can't really hear the person helping me because of all of the other voices behind them and the music. I am 29 years old with great hearing but the music is too loud, and the speakers are already blown from it being too loud. Along with the amount of employees talking, it's a little distracting while trying to build your own pizza.   Lastly, there is an employee that walked around three times and asked to take away my pizza or get me a box because I am slow at eating it, and they have nothing to do. Or that's their job but after the first time and the second time, I was a little bothered by the third time. A little silly. It's not their fault though, management doesn't need to have that many employees at one time. I can't imagine they'll be there for very long considering the overhead, and payroll at this rate....And it'd be nice if they did. So hopefully they figure that out.",

My twist on ordering is a build-your-own, mostly a margarita with the addition of crushed garlic olive oil and parmesean...give it a try!  As far as crust, the dough is a bit over-worked; as a result not as thick or fluffy on the edge. The sauce is definitely San Marzano tomatos, top quality!  Bottom line, Blaze Neapolitan is second only to 800 Degrees who ripped Blaze and improved the dough recipe.  Try them both and decide yourself.",

The 12 inch pies (they are actually larger) are $8-9 each and very filling. We love the Green Stripe (pesto, grilled chicken, red peppers, garlic, mozzarella, arugula) with much more to try. They also have good fountain drinks and beer. We will be back!",

    "text": "At least one friend highly recommended Blaze Pizza, although I'm sure he goes to a different location.  I stopped in today and was greeted warmly, asked if I'd been there before.  Because I haven't gone to a Blaze Pizza before, the young man explained the process to me.  Earlier today, another friend told me that it only takes about five minutes for them to cook your pizza.  (I had whined to her that I was going to have to wait while they make my pizza; not being familiar with their menu, I couldn't phone in a pick up order.)  Well, she was right.  It only took about five minutes to make the pizza.  BUT it took closer to 10 minutes to get through the line!  There were several people in front of me.  Each guest chooses their toppings, one by one; and, one by one, the toppings are added to the crust.  That takes a long time.  And I could barely hear the people working behind the counter.  I had to ask two young men to repeat what they had asked me.  It's noisy in there and I have old ears.  I took home a pizza and a Greed salad.  It was only $17.  The salad wasn't great, it was OK.  The pizza was OK.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't great.  Hence my A-OK rating.  Will give it one more try.  Next time, we'll try the thicker crust.  As for ambiance, I don't see myself ever eating in.  Hard bench tables and bench seats; lots of families and kids; close (tight) quarters.  They do sell beer and wine, so maybe Hubby and I will eat in one day, but I doubt it.  Not that there is anything wrong with a family-style pizzeria; it's just not my cup of tea.",

The concept is like a Subway, but for pizza. You order your crust and sauce first, then move down the line for cheese, meat and veggies. You pay for your meal, which comes out to be under $9 for a personal pizza that lasts 2 meals for most people.   The ingredients are always fresh. You can ask for more of whatever you want if they get skimpy with something. Like, who puts 3 basil leaves on a whole pizza? You better believe I asked for more. I've never had to wait long for our pizza to bake and have never had to fight for a table. Although I can imagine the cluster f**k during peak lunch and dinner times.   Three small things I don't like about this place. One kid butchered my name when he wrote it on the paper lining. \"Mearie\" as he spelled it. Nice one guy even after I spelled it out for you. I don't like their ranch at all. Idk what it is, but it's absolutely disgusting. And their agua frescas taste like nothing.

I love that they have gluten free crust (ask for it well done or else it's never fully cooked), vegan cheese and vegan \"popcorn chicken\".

They're a little big for one person, just right for two, with a salad each. I was gonna give them three stars, but they get an extra one for being such GREAT stewards of the environment with their cups and straws made from plants, not petroleum. That's just cool.",

There was some cheese on it. Your cashier was polite and had a new pizza made up for me.

I tried three of their pizza's the other day at a party, which is the type of setting this caters to better than other big chains.  Dough: M'eh. A big too thick for Neapolitan.  Cheese: M'eh. Not horrible, but definitely reinforced the low price.  Sauce: M'eh. I managed to taste the sauce on it's own. It needed salt and/or a big garlic.  So that's pretty much sums up what to expect from their cheese pizza, we also had a Hawaiian and a mushroom & sausage.  Toppings:  The Hawaiian: Plenty of pineapple, but the Canadian ham slices were too big for such a small pizza. They also had arugula on top which I thought was a nice touch and added a bite of tanginess that the cheese was missing.  Mushroom & Sausage: Really like the sausage on this pizza, really made up for the lack of flavor, not a mushrooms fan, but they weren't that bad.  So, if good, cheap, fast pizza is on your list, then I'd check it out, but if you are looking for a nice sit down meal there are a much better places in the area.  Bonus: They use cornmeal instead of flour for working the dough. Hardly see that out here in Vegas.",

    "text": "Love this place. Although the line was almost literally all the way around the restaurant, the line moved pretty quickly. For a very decent price (about $8), you can create your own pizza with a great variety of quality toppings and you get a 10-12\" pizza! Since the crust isn't super thick and bready, you don't fill up on dough and crust and get to enjoy your creation. I think future locations need to seriously think larger seating capacity(!); and turn down the music a little. It was pretty loud tonight, I had to speak pretty loudly just to talk to the employees making my pizza. Will definitely be back.",

The bake the pizzas right in front of you in a large open fired oven.  I ordered the red vine which is super delicious, basil, cherry tomatoes and mozzarella balls.  It is a bit crowded but he line moves quickly.  My only complaint and it's not really a complaint is that the inside dining room does get rather loud.  Fortunately it was cool enough to sit outside so we enjoyed our pizza's there! Where Luke came and asked if we needed anything!  Super friendly place!",

This place was packed in a way I haven't seen any other custom-built pizza place packed, so I knew I was in for something good. For such a busy place, they're really efficient with their assembly line system. I opted for the white cream pizza (bacon, garlic, white cream sauce, oregano, and arugula topped at the end) and added roasted garlic (love the huge whole pieces!), pepperoni, and mushrooms. Made the long drive back to the westside before I had a bite, but once I did, I really enjoyed it. This place is still too far out for me to be a regular, so I will stick to my local The Pizza Kitchen, but next time I'm on this side of town, I'd for sure come back.",

We loved that there was one price no matter how many toppings you get, the desserts were also only $2, and the cane sugar soda and lemonades were awesome as well.   We ordered a BBQ pizza and subbed jalapenos for the banana peppers. We also added spicy red sauce as the base, bacon, and pineapple. Same price. We also got a side Caesar salad, a brownie, and a smore pie. The crust was perfect, it was done quickly and we are the whole thing. The desserts were delicious! Also, all of the plastics and paper products were biodegradable and plant based. We will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I love the pizza here. My low review is due to the customer service I received today. I made an online order for 5 pizzas for a working lunch at the office and went to pick it up. When I got to the register I saw a sign that said \"Download the Blaze App and get a free drink.\" So I ordered 4 drinks, and while I was downloading the app I showed the Cashier gal to redeem my free drink. She almost handed me the cup then pulled it back, saying she needed to check with the manager. I said \"OK\", I can understand that, but then she turned around and asked a co-worker putting pizzas in the oven, and he confirmed her judgment and said \"yeah, we should ask the manager.\" While I do understand that they may not know if the promotion is still running, I found it a little distasteful because the sign is posted ON the cash machine, it's very visible. and it's just a drink, after all. I went to fill up the other 4 drinks and when I returned, all was forgotten. They handed me the drink holder but never followed up to give me an answer. It was clear they didn't ask the manager or cared to at least tell me \"no.\" I just bought $50 worth of pizzas and am a loyal customer, and have full intentions of using the app and will continue eating here. I know it's just a drink but I think the entire staff should a) know what promotions are going on or b) if they don't know, but it's posted and it's something trivial like a free small drink, to just support it bc that's just good customer service. Sorry for the bad review, but I was disappointed today.",

Ive been there 7 times now, and havent been disappointed once. Ive tried 6 different pies, and each one has been great. There perfect for 1 person, or if your just grbbing a snack, 2 can share, but its a meal for 1. The great thing is, even if there busy, your not going to wait long at all. If the line is at the door, and your building a pie to bring home, your in and out in 10 minutes at the most. Thats at a busy time.

I didn't have to add the red flakes afterwards because the sauce was enough plus the banana peppers I added. They have vegan cheese for an additional $3. The crust is thin, so you don't feel overly full if you eat the entire personal pizza. It could have use an extra minute in the fire, since a very small part was doughy but overall good tasting. Sat on the patio which is nice to escape the crowds inside. An employee came by later and picked up our trays and trash. Very good service from ordering until we left.",

He didn't seem too pleased to work there, but I don't blame him. There's also the cashier kid who kept using \"bro\" after every sentence, like some meathead freshmen frat kid.

The pizza comes out so hot & flavorful & FRESH! :)   They also have VEGAN pizza options and are so accommodating with any type of special orders or possible food allergies. They even ask if you want them to change their gloves when applying your vegan cheese! Amazing!!   But my favorite thing about this place is the incredible & extremely friendly staff. From all the hard workers on the pizza line to the cashiers to the bussers, everyone is just sooooooooo nice, considerate & helpful. I didn't get everyones names but I did happen to get BROOKS name when he came over and ask how my pizza tasted! Wonderful customer service given by such a personable staff.

    "text": "So as I have stated in other pizza place reviews, I think pizza is super subjective.  I mean, all food is, but pizza is just one of those things that the crust for one person is divine, while it tastes like crackers for another.  For me, Blaze has some insanely good pizza at a super reasonable price.    I am a basics girl...pepperoni, cheese, maybe some olives or mushrooms.  Blaze gets it spot on. Deliciousness.  Crust tastes perfect, sauce is a bit spicy and sweet,and if you order the build your own for 7.95, they will add extra of anything if you don't feel like it is enough.  Nice...  Service is great and the only reason they lost a star is because I ordered online once and was ignored when I come in to pick it up.  This resulted in a 30 minute wait and eventually a cold pizza.  However, this pizza is well worth the wait and I will even eat it cold if that is the only way I can get it!",

This is the kind of place that makes the pizza right in front of you, using exactly the toppings and amounts you want, and bakes it right in front of you. Think Subway for pizza. The quality is awesome, and there's nothing like pointing to the toppings you want and getting it. If you can't see it, it's just not the same. And there's no BS about how many or how much toppings. I prefer very very light Cheese, and being able to watch, and say STOP, means I can actually get the amount I want. I'm definitely going back, a lot!",

The longest amount of time I have had to wait for my pizza was 7 minutes.       I just have once problem with this place. Everytime they have fresh circles of dough ready for topping on the counter, they have to replace the old salads with new salads. Why is this such a huge problem for me? The cold water beneath the salads, deep onto the dough! Absolutely disgusting. Then, you have to tell them to replace your dough which takes about 2 minutes.      Although that has happened to me here, I still adore their pizza.",

The only thing that saves me coming back is the pick two as I share my garlic dough knots with friends and I can't finish a whole pizza so it really is a great deal.   I was also disappointed with how my half pizza turned out. The bottom was super burnt and one of the edges and they were offering other guests who's pizza turned out sub par to have them redone, and mine was simply boxed and the sauce forgotten until I had to remind them to put the bbq sauce on it. And then I had to wait for the employee to finish his conversation with a coworker, finish two other pizzas to box and then barely drizzle any sauce on mine. I would've asked for more but I was already late because I had to ask for bbq sauce.",

We ordered out so I totally can't judge on the restaurant itself or how good the service was. My friends parents ordered for us so this is solely my opinion on the pizza itself.   It wasn't the worst pizza I've ever had and I wouldn't even say I hated it but I found it overall kind of bland. I liked the vegan popcorn chicken but that was kinda the only part I was thrilled about. The crust is rather thin and everything else was kinda tasteless.   I give you props for your vegan options though so well done!",

The pizza is a good decent size, it easily feeds 2 adults! Or 1 adult, 2 kids! Depending on how much you eat of course.   It definitely a place you must try if your a pizza lover!",

But minus a star (my mood today almost took 2 off) because ordering online the pizza just doesn't compare. I asked for double on all the veggies & didn't come close. Not the first time this has happened. I just need to learn- don't plan on pizza unless there's time to go in & order it and wait for it to cook.",

    "text": "I love blaze pizza but online ordering here is a nightmare! Having 4 kids I thought I would save some time and just order ahead and pick up in store. I dedicated a pick up time and the pizzas were on the counter waiting when I got there - sweet! However, one of the pizzas was incorrect (toppings were not what I ordered). I let the guy know and said it needed to be remade. He said no problem but totally pushed my remake aside and after 20 mins I went back to the counter, as my kids were finishing theirs and mine was nowhere in sight. There was another guy, Luke, who seemed aware and said it was being made but \"the large pizza requires more time\" for the crust. Another 25 minutes went by! This time my kids were crying, ready to go and still no pizza! It was in the oven at this point so we stood there waiting. I took the pizza and said I wanted a refund bc 45 minutes for a remake was unacceptable. Luke said no problem just a minute, so I loaded my kids in the car and he came back saying the tablet wasn't working for online orders. I said to call me when it was able to be refunded then bc I had to get my kids out of there. It took another 2.5 hours and 2 calls MYSELF to the store (and many excuses) to finally get the refund! Absolutely unacceptable! Worst customer service and my pizza was still missing 2 TOPPINGS! Never will I order online nor will I recommend!",

    "text": "I've been to Blaze Pizza, at this location, for a while. Probably since I started my undergrad because it was one of the few and newer pizza places around anthem that had a \"build your own\" pizza. The first couple times were really good. I thought it was super nice and affordable to have unlimited toppings for just around $8. Also you could make it how you wanted. Fast forward maybe 6 or 7 years later, I feel like they're still making the same great pizza as the first time I've went there. (Given that I've been away from Vegas for a couple years and haven't stopped by until recently.) I really can always count on getting good quality pizzas from this location every time I go. However, I wish they would cook my pizza a little bit longer so I can get that crispy crust, even though I do mention it to the workers there. Regardless, I still think they do it quick and efficient! Another thing I like about them is how they are never skimpy on the toppings and the sauces, you can ask to drizzle over the pizza after it's done. Many places might be cheap and don't wanna give you extra cheese, meats, or veggies. With Blaze, I never have that issue and I have never encountered a worker giving me attitude asking for extra anything.",

I then read the about us and the faq on the company website and I was there.  We had two pizza's and they were both more then Amazing.  The crust is a thin crust a Huge plus, and with all the toppings I had which was just about all of them, I was told it would take a little longer to cook which was fine.  I was able to watch the guy working the pizza oven and he worked with perceission looking like an artist at work.  The entire staff are very warm and friendly from the time you come in the door until the time you leave.  Everyone makes you feel welcome and if you need something all you need to do is ask as they are there for you.

The vegetarian pizza cannot have any meat on it and since they don't wipe their pizza cutters in between pizza we started to ask them to not cut it.  Last time we went in, I used the mobile app and place two separate orders so they surely could not mess up which pizza was not to be cut. Well guess what...they cut the veggie pizza(we found a small piece of sausage on it) and they didn't cut the meat. How can you mess this up so many times.  I don't want to have to manage the employees, but when they get busy...they make a lot of mistakes, plus they forget the BBQ & Pesto drizzle even that it was on the online order ticket! Even the note for NO CUT was on it.  Very frustrating...hire more people so they can execute during the busy times please! I love the food so much that I really want to continue to eat here, but if this poor execution continues, I'm going to have to go back to domino's...  Please fix!!!",

    "text": "I usually LOVE blaze, but I was extremely disappointed by my visit to this location. The service was absolutely awful, and the food was meh at best. Let me elaborate. I walk in, don't get greeted like I do at my home blaze in California...not the end of the world. The girl taking my order was not at all enthusiastic. She acted like she did not know how to put sauce on a pizza and made zero eye contact with me every time she asked me something or talked as if she was mumbling. I remained optimistic, then moving on to the meat portion the girl asked me if I wanted one or two turkey meatballs (like really?! They usually just break a bunch up and pile them on!) the toppings were not put on as I like. I waited at the cash register for almost 5 minutes and the guy running it was doing like 5 other jobs at once while the other employees didn't seem eager to help as it was not even crowded (at least not as close to as crowded as the one I go to in the Bay Area)...my pizza comes out of the oven and sits at the cutting station for over 5 minutes without anyone touching it. I was pretty disappointed after seeing that, and yes my pizza was really cold, the toppings were not even cooked (all the veggies tasted raw) and the sauce was not spread correctly. I was optimistic about this location since it's near me and I frequent the Trader Joe's across the street almost daily, but I guess I'll have to find a different location to go to. The only positive part about my experience was a staff member checking on me outside while I was eating. Kinda sucks because I just moved here and would have become a regular (at least once a week or more) at this location but unless something changes I probably will not come again. I hope management will take the time to better train these employees and let them know how to handle properly making a pizza and getting it out to the guest in a timely fashion.",

    "text": "'Bout time a pizza joint like this came closer. Similar to the Pieology Concept, Blaze is a convent, clean, friendly pizza place. Walked in and there's a good line, but they are well organized and keep the line moving at a steady pace. You pick your pizza from the menu (or can customize it), and like Subway or Chipotle, you walk down the line and tell them what you'd like on your pizza. At the end it's 180 seconds for them to wood fire your pizza to golden, black crusted yumminess.  A pizza is $7.95, cheese only $5, and they are about the size of a small pizza, so two kids or light eaters could definitely share a pizza. They have a few different salads likes green, Caesar, and a tomato-mozzarella-basil. They also have these cute smore pies ($2) that they warm up by the fire.  The 2 owners were there and they along with the general staff were some of the friendliest people in the food and service industry I've encountered in awhile.  We'll be back, fo' sho.",

    "text": "You could easily say that Blaze Pizza is like Chipotle meets a pizza joint. It's more than that, though. There is a very large selection of toppings, so you can make SO many different kinds of pies. Everything looked market fresh and the taste surely was on point. My pie came out lickety-split & was nicely browned. I got the Red Vine: red sauce, ovalini mozzarella, parmesan, fresh basil, cherry tomatoes and olive oil drizzle. The crust was thin with a healthy crunch to it.  The red sauce had robust flavor. I made an executive decision to add some red onions and sea salt.  Overall, my pizza was delicious, fresh, and more than enough to feed one hungry person.  I finished the meal with the S'more Pie. This thing was legit!  Milk chocolate, marshmallow sandwiched between some graham cookies. They will warm this up for you in the oven so it is nice and gooey, as a s 'more should be!   The staff was friendly and very attentive. A couple of them checked on my meal once I started to eat it and even offered to refill my drink for me.   I highly recommend that everyone give Blaze a try, I think you will be pleased with what you find.",

There are various options here for dough preferences, toppings, and foundation sauces.   Service here is really friendly, quick, and knowledgeable. Even on the busiest days, the line system is quick and efficient here. I love the quality of the service and the quality of the food here.   The dough is always fresh, just like the toppings. Some spots that let you pick toppings don't always have the freshest or most aesthetically appealing array of choices, but Blaze definitely hits the mark on freshness every time I've come in along with a zest of variety.    My boyfriend and I usually build our own pizzas and swap slices. The portions are great and perfect for that since they are individual pizzas. Great job team Blaze! Thank you Lexi for the extra mushrooms!",

Gross  I feel like this was happening because logistically, there is no good \"waiting\" area for those with to go orders. There's an entrance off the patio that people come in to, then it's the end of the line, the soda machines are right there. There's just not a lot of room or space to have people wait and not be in the way. Then the to go orders are set up on the counter where anyone can reach, grab, touch, knock down, someone else's food or accidentally grab the wrong order. Definitely see some opportunity for improvement in this area.  Overall, great place and good food!",

Definitely ask for a different dressing than the one that comes with it. It was horrendous!!!  Update: They certainly redeemed themselves. The staff was very friendly and my pizza was cooked perfectly this time. Even tho they had a rush they weren't all over the place.   So generally I love this place. The 2 stars are not for the food bc it's usually great, however tonight on my to go order it was a bit soggy in the middle, it's for the lack luster service. The girl that took my order was not engaged when listening to what I wanted and seemed a little put off as if I was interrupting her other duties. Then when my pizza was waiting to go in the oven I stood there for about 5 mins before the same girl took my money on the register even tho there were a ton of workers milling around. I'll probably go back because usually the service is very friendly. Hopefully on the next visit I can up the stars. I really don't like giving these types of reviews but something about her customer service just rubbed me completely wrong along with her co workers that just stood around.",

The nice kid behind the counter had no idea what I was talking about.  And never asked what kind of salad I wanted through out this whole experience.   Fast fwd- my pizza gets burnt. Manager comes out and instructs the angry kid at the ovens to ask if I would like it redone. (Along with the 3 other guests who had their pizzas burnt) it wasn't busy at all.   My burnt pizza sits there for about 6 minutes. No one says a word or addresses the burnt pies that are now piling up. Meanwhile the angry kid at the ovens is slicing pizza's SO aggressively that the pie slides off the counter toward him and he catches it with the CROTCH of his jeans. The pie had been sitting on the counter for at least 2 minutes so I would assume it was no longer steaming hot, but regardless unlikely he wouldn't have felt it through the jeans he was wearing.   He tosses the pie back on the counter and walks away to blow off steam. Returns a minute later, finishes slicing the same pie and puts it in a BOX!!! At this point the lady who was in front of me (also waiting for her food after 15 min) got back in line for a refund, as did I   I can't believe I saw someone catch a falling pizza on the crotch of his jeans and put it in a box like it was normal practice.   Disgusting doesn't do it justice.  I will never ever go there again and will make sure no one I know does either.   The guy behind the register who issued my refund was apologetic but the damage has been done and all trust lost.   Gross!!!",

Never had been to Blaze before and had found this was down the street from work, so I had came to try it out.  The line extended down the building past Jersey's Mike's. Waited between 60 - 90 minutes from getting in line til actually having the pizza in hand  By the time i got up to the counter, i was clueless how you're supposed to order so i asked for a custom pizza (lol shush)  With a choice of \"sauces\", \"cheeses\", \"meats\", \"veggies\", and \"finishes\", there are an endless combination  I picked an \"Original Dough\" pizza w/ \"spicy red sauce\", \"mozzarella\" and \"ricotta\" cheeses, \"applewood bacon\", \"italian sausage\", \"pepperoni\", \"artichokes\", \"banana peppers\", \"mushrooms\", \"red onions\", EXTRA \"roasted garlic\", \"sauteed onions\".   Unfortunately i missed the part for \"finishes\" otherwise id ask for \"arugula\" too.   Despite them being so busy, they made and churned the pizza's out really quickly. After the pizza was \"made\", it only took but a few minutes for it to be ready, boxed, and called out.   The pizza overall was ok. Sauces didn't come through too much but maybe due to the large amount of ingredients piled on. LOL. It didn't sit well in my stomach though as i had some stomach pains but i can't tell if it was due to the pizza or somehow eating the entire pizza myself. So i can't blame anyone.",

Well, YOU don't actually do it, you just move down the line and choose your toppings as a worker is making it - kind of like Subway! They have vegan cheese and the crust is vegan so it's a nice option for vegans. My sister took me here and suggested the pesto sauce instead of the traditional sauce. I opted for both. I'm glad I was able to do half pesto and half traditional. The pizza was tasty and light, as in, not overwhelmingly oily or fattening.   For service, I give 2 stars! The workers weren't friendly at all. I understand it gets busy but they truly treat you like you're just another number, like they could take it or leave it when it comes to your patronage. When we got our pizzas, there were no available tables so we opted to sit at the tables outside, but it was far too cold. So we decided to take our pizzas to-go. When we asked for boxes, the lady worker toward the end of the employee assembly line looked irritated. She didn't say a word and just kind of tossed boxes at us. Not a \"Sure\" or \"Sorry there's no place to sit; but we'd be happy to give you some boxes.\" I hope they change their level of customer service. Oh well!",

They make the (thin) crust in a cool way, so it's always consistent from the first bite to the last.  Toppings were good and plentiful, and overall taste was delicious.  Price was reasonable as well.  Was pretty rammed inside so we sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed a nice view of the sunset over the mountains.  Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Once I've heard about this place I wanted to check it out. I didn't realize how close to home it was. Some co-workers had ordered some pizzas one day @ work & told me it was really good. I actually ended up winning a $10 gift certificate from work for completing a survey so that's definitely another reason to check Blaze out.   I ended up getting a buy one get one free coupon in my mailbox. The other night my man & I were hungry & talking about getting some pizza. I checked out the coupon & actually found out that it expired that day so we decided to head there & grab some pizza. It was free for us with the coupon & gift card.   I ordered the BBQ chicken which I wasn't too impressed with. They actually don't put the BBQ sauce on top of the dough but on top of the pizza which I found it to be kinda dry. The chicken pieces tasted \"fake\" like the package chicken you can buy @ the grocery store in the deli sandwich meat section. I ended up getting the \"thick\" crust which I actually ended up liking the thinner crust that my man got better. I guess anything is worth a try cause we all have different opionions but I wouldn't ordered the BBQ chicken one again.   My man was nice & let me try some of his Meat lover with spicy sauce. I have to say the sauce wasn't spicy to me @ all, but as I mentioned the thin crust was yummy. His pizza tasted way better then mine.   We got there about 9:30pm & they close @ 10pm. We didn't have to wait very long for our pizzas & we took them to go. Staff was friendly.   You won't pay more then $9.00 ($8 & some change) for a pizza no matter how many toppings you get. I will definitely go back & try a make my own pizza. Place kinda reminds me of an upgrade from Little Ceasars.",

    "text": "Blaze sounds like a plan! Oh yeah I'm here for pizza! Save that thought for later then!  After being stretched and pulled at my very first physical therapy appointment it's time for a treat! Pizza is always on my radar as that! What a way to reward oneself? I know pizza right!   Blaze pizza is very very busy and so worth the time that it will take to achieve pizza actually in your hands. Pizza the fix all and ultimate achievement in human kind. When you walk in the friendly Blaze a worker asks you what's your pizza poison is. Trust you are going to want the whole menu! Damn! The free smells are so amazing! Intoxicating, yes!  What a fantastic menu? Such wonderful customer service too! Love it! The menu here favors the customer as well! Here's how. Deciding to try the special: a half a pizza and salad or knots for $8.25 was what I ordered. Let's talk about how they dress up the pizza. They offer 14 toppings and you can have as many or as little as you need on that said pizza. Wow. The quality of the ingredients is so refreshing and looks delicious behind that glass that separates me from my pizza.   Wanting to stay on that said health kick I went with the apple, feta, and walnut salad. The salad was amazing with the use of the dark greens and lots of feta in that salad. It's so good! The apples were fresh and cut recently as well! That first stick with the fork to the salad was so delightful the flavors of apple, walnut, and feta cheese all mix together and create a wonderful flavor. A drink of Stella Artois puts the finishing touch of amazement. Now that we know how the salad tastes let's move on to the pizza!  The pizza as I said can have up to 14 toppings all for the same great price. They make the pizza in front of you. As you move to sauce I had the choice of red, white, none, or green. I choose the red but very lightly on that thin crust pizza dough that will be very shortly visiting the oven. I went with all white cheeses mozzarella, feta, Parmesan, and ricotta. Did I mention the cheeses are all fresh? Plus cheese is my weakness and no they do not give samples of the cheese to try! Too bad!. Let's continue with that pizza, shall we. I decided to add, since there is no limit Pepperoni, Sausage, Extra Cheese (of course), Mushroom, and Jalapeno. What a fantastic and delicious combo? Now it's time for the pizza to take a cruise in the oven and infuse all the flavor together!   It seems like forever from when you pay for all your purchases till you get the actual dough! Hopefully you got that! Continuing that pizza of mine is cooking in the giant pizza oven. Go pizza go! Cook for momma! I wonder what it tastes like! Finally after I sit down and almost finish my beer and half the salad they call my name for the pizza. Yes, I said they call your name to go retrieve your own pizza but for greatness I'm all for it! I walked up to the counter and got that famously smelling pizza!  Brought that pizza back to the table and settled in with round two of Stella Artois out of the bottle. Here we go that time of fight or flight! Its gonna be a fight, since have you ever tried to take pizza from a girl that has issues on her arm. No, moving on! Picked up that first slice of the delicious smelling pizza and unable I gave into that wicked tasting pizza. All of my senses were dancing around with the cheeses all mixing with the meat proteins and those jaleopenos the resistance. Lets just say that the pizza did not stand a chance, it was eaten and truly enjoyed.   If you have not been to Blaze Pizza now you know how exciting it can be to eat here. Make sure you come when you have a little extra time on your hands, so that you can enjoy the whole ordering experience. You can order ahead on their app too if needed. I don't recommend this since you miss out on what the business is trying to offer to the customer. Plus if you feel the need that you are overly excited order a beer or wine to take that edge off. Until then wicked pizza exists here at Blaze. Come in and try if you are brave enough!",

Blaze has a create your own concept with plenty of toppings to choose from for your pizza. For those that get overwhelmed by too many options they also have suggested combinations. In addition to the pizzas they have dough knots, salads, and a few dessert options. There is even the option to get half of a pizza with either salad or dough knots.   A very busy location, but the employees handled the crowd well when we dined in. We didn't wait long for our order. The employees were friendly and helpful.  The Meat Eater and Dough Knots made for a good dinner. The pizza was good and not too heavy because of the thin crust. The dough knots were a little more indulgent with cheese and grease, but good. The pricing, around $8 for a pizza seems reasonable.",

I ordered from the Blaze app over 30 minutes in advance, 2 BYO pizzas and a salad. When I went to pick it up, I was surprised that not a single employee questioned or confirmed that I was indeed picking up my order and not just a random person swiping someone else's order.   Now partly of my own fault, I did not specify to leave the salad in the fridge RATHER than have it resting on top of TWO fresh hot pizzas.   I also made the rookie mistake of not checking the quality of the pizza before leaving with my goods. One had a large bubble in the dough (I'm assuming it exploded once it was in the pizza oven) that bubble is about the size of a whole slice. I get it, its freshly made, small bubbles are normal.  I ordered 30 minutes in advance, thats MORE than adequate time to make a new one. Was really craving the awesome pizza you guys made and this was just sad.... hot Caesar salad and ruined pizza",

I picked up my order today, and as I walked out noticed the second receipt on the box was a different name than my own. Went back to counter, and was able to sort out the mid label and get my correct pizza. After I get home, I open my pizza to see there isn't any mozzarella cheese. It's listed on my order, and my receipts, but isn't on my pizza at all.   This location used to have a great vibe, good customer service, and great pizza. For about the last 4 months, I've not been greeted at all (just grabbed my pizza and walked out), told my pizza would take an additional 1-2 mins and it took 15, had desserts not placed with my pickup order when it's also listed on the receipt, and in general just not been treated great. I don't expect anything over the top but a hello might be nice, as would getting an online order correct. It's extremely frustrating because I really like the pizza (the only reason it's 2 stars) and it's super convenient to home. Probably will be a while before I head back in, if I don't just find a similar type place within a reasonable distance.",

Each pizza is certainly enough for a hungry individual and reheated (or cold) leftovers are also delicious (although I see to finish all of MY pizzas).  This place is great because my family of four can order what they want and how they want it and we never have to compromise on the toppings.  My favorite is the spicy-red pizza sauce with fresh ovalini cheese, topped with meats and veggies.  My wife likes the pesto-based sauce with chicken and veggies, while both of my kids like to experiment with toppings each time we come.  At $7-8 a pizza, it's definitely an affordable option to satisfy a family of four!  It takes only 2-3 minutes for each pizza to cook, so waiting is not an issue.  I've also tried the online ordering - they don't cook the pizzas until you arrive, so no issues with cold food.  The online option doesn't give you a few options that you can get ordering live, so that's what I prefer.  It's hard to justify Dominos or Pizza Hut when this place can satisfy everyone for less!",

All of the gentlemen were very pleasant (oddly i only saw 1 girl who was working the oven while there were 8+ guys, just a weird observation) Very reasonably priced, super delicious pizza, all very fresh looking toppings and quick service. I wish that there was a location closer to me because i would go here quite often. I also wish i had cash on me because i would have left a tip (not something i usually do at a fast-casual establishment)",

    "text": "I have to admitI was skeptical when I saw how thin the crust was. I am not a thin crust person, I like medium to thick crust. I built my own and sat down at a table. One of the workers went above and beyond delivering our pizza to us and bringing over utensils, napkins, Parmesan cheese, and crushed red pepper. I was impressed with the quality and crispness of the crust. The crust prior to cooking was as thin as a crepe! It rose a lot while cooking and was crispy. Think of this place as the Chipotle of pizzas. You order at the counter, decide your toppings or order their pre designed pizzas and if you want a salad, they have a bunch to choose from. The workers were fast but seemed to not hear what we were saying and that could have been due to the music being a tad loud?  They have limited indoor and outdoor seating. If you're going to dine there, be realistic and go during off peak dining times. Please save fellow yelpers from eye rolls because you needed seating for six people at 6pm and could not believe there was not enough space. Yes, it's limited seating!",

Arranged sort of like Chipotles. Easy to figure out. They have a couple basics, some signatures and of course build your own. They have a GF option for crust and we were told they didn't use corn meal for those who are allergic. I had the chicken bbq (extra peppers) little less messy to share with grandson. Wife had build your own with everything but the kitchen sink in it. Pizzas were cooked crispy (cracker crust) and arrived piping hot. They have a comfortable dining room and for spring and summer a nice patio. 97 degrees so we chose to dine inside and enjoy the AC. The only negative for me was they have Coke products (Pepsi Guy.) NP since they have water. Didn't explore their beer options since grandson was with, but they do have beer available. Expect they will make it into the list of regulars. Nice addition to the Eastern corridor.",

Basil, feta, mozzarella, Italian sausage, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and onions in a mix of white and red sauce. So good. Pizza was so big that I could only eat 2 slices. Took the rest home. But what great leftovers I have for tomorrow. Unless of course my kids eat everything. Who am I kidding? They will. Anyway, definitely will return. Worth the 10 minute drive from my house. Service is UNBEATABLE! Best service I have had in years. The guy that was sweeping the floor asked us if we were doing ok as he walked by us. Who does that at a fast food restaurant? Everyone who worked there was attentive and friendly, and it was a very busy night. Not sure if it would be as good if I didn't eat it there. 180 seconds in the oven really doesn't get the toppings hot enough to last a drive home. All in all, great pizza!",

He had an irritated facial expression that made him look unapproachable. While another guy asked what I wanted as toppings on one of the pizzas that I orders & while I'm telling him what I wanted- this kid with the blond hair kept interrupting me with the same questions that I had already answered several times. He seemed like those children who interrupt two grown ups while talking because they don't understand what manners are yet. I must have told him about 4 times that I wanted vegan cheese on my pizzas.

You walk into the restaurant and you can either pick one of their specialty pizzas or creat your own. The best part about this place is that you can create your own pizza with as many toppings as you want with no extra charge! The pizzas here are on a thin crust so not everyone I take here enjoys it. For dessert, you can order a Smore Pie that is delicious and melts in your mouth. Their employees are pretty friendly and the place looks cool. I warn you though, if you come during the lunch rush, the line goes out the door and there is no room to sit. This place is just that good!  What exactly do I order? Create your own pizza with white sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, bacon, extra bacon, extra extra bacon, garlic, sauteed onions, basil, pineapple, mushroom, roasted red peppers, oregano, spinach, extra spinach, and arugula to top it off:)",

Blaze owners you need to do something about this. These kids deserve more for all of the work they are putting in, especially on a Friday night!",

Multiple base sauce options and a variety of veggies and meats ensure that you can create something you'll like. Even though there was a crowd we got through the line, placed our order and received our food fairly quickly. The crust of the pizza is thin, it has to be for them to cook them as fast as they do, but it's good. The 11 inch personal pizzas are a pretty good deal and if you build your own you can put an unlimited variety of toppings on it. Not the most high quality ingredients I've ever had on a pizza but still good.   Overall, I liked Blaze. It's a nice compromise between Domino's and Grimaldi's. I'll be back.",

You can even choose gluten free dough! You then can add anything you want down the line, including extra meats, at no extra charge! Items include peperoni, bacon, ricotta cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, red peppers, garlic, etc. Then they fire up the pizza while you wait. Only takes a couple of minutes.   There is also an assortment of salads, beers, or a little smores pie for dessert.   We love this place. The food is great, the prices are good, and we like the atmosphere. It's always busy, so you know it's good!",

In my initial trip to Blaze Pizza I was turned off by the relatively flavorless thin crust. Well, the crust hasn't changed. But my approach to ordering the pizza has. Since the crust was not going to be a significant positive, I decided to load up the toppings. Now, the toppings were excessively plentiful and very tasty. The ton of toppings was able to  mask the fact that the crust was not very good.  So when you bury a mediocre crust with a ton of toppings that you really enjoy, the pizza tastes really good. Still not my favorite pizza in town, but a good place to go for a fast $10 lunch.",

Your 11\" personal pizza dough moves along (assembly line style) with staff adding your choice of various toppings along the way. They offer a variety of sauces, including a spicy red sauce. Most toppings you could want on a pizza are here at Blaze's. At the end, the pizza is put in a open gas fired oven that turns out pizza's in 3-4 minutes flat due to the blazing 180 temperature! You might need a little extra time if you have a lot of toppings on your pizza. Your finished product is a crispy thin personal pizza made your way.  For dessert, we had their S'more Pie. It is a s'more that is heated up near the hot oven when you are ready for dessert. The price is right at $2.00 per s'more.  Your also not robbed on fountain drinks here. Seems were ever I go these days, it is $3-$4 for your non alcoholic beverage. At Blaze they offer a great selection of fountain drinks including cherry-coke and two varieties of fresh lemonade options for $1.85.  The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and pleasant - they greet you coming in and say good-bye on the way out. The owner passes by to do his satisfaction check as well.

I read on Thursday that this place was opening a location on Durango and was serving free pizza. It was stuck on my mind since then.  I think the business is still pretty new so I give the staff an a-ok. They are immensely staffed. Idk how many pizzas they are cranking out but I can't imagine them lasting too long with the amount of staff they have. There was literally like 15 people working and it really wasn't busy. To their credit though I did think they were all pleasant to interact it. The initial person I came in contact with who asked if it was my first time did a great job explaining their concept and pricing quickly and effectively.  Blazed offers a personal size pizza ranging from $5 for a cheese pizza, $6 for a one topping pizza, or $7 and some change for a pizza with unlimited toppings. It's almost like a chipotle and subway hybrid ordering system. The $7 and some change price point gets you the restaurant's pre-selected pizzas of which you can add additional toppings to or take toppings out from. Has the concept stuck yet?You seriously can put anything on the pizza. They have a large variety of meats, cheeses, and veggies to choose from and the price stays at $8 and some change after tax. Not bad in theory. Was it good? Yes!  So getting vegan cheese ups your price by $2 then the gluten free crust ups your price by another $3. My pizza in the end cost $13 and change. It was about the cost of two of their non gluten free non vegan pizzas. When you put it that way: two pizzas for $14... Not bad!   After you make your choices they toss your pizza into the oven and cook it for you. It takes about 5 minutes to come out.   I really liked my pizza. I got the veg out. It was their veggie pizza. I did have to add lots veggies on top of the pre-selected toppings. The gluten free crust was also good. It was almost cracker-like. I told the staff that I don't have a gluten allergy and was just trying it out and they advised me that the crust is thinner and therefore putting too much on it might be a bad idea. Nice tip from the staff. Kudos!   I liked this place and can't wait to go back. It was clean, the staff was nice, and IMO the price is right. I split my pizza with someone but I definitely would be game to have one all to myself. I would probably not get a gluten free crust or get vegan cheese next time to keep my price low.   My suggested topping would definitely be the roasted garlic. That would be a great addition to ANY pizza.",

I love pizza and I love the fact that you can customize your own pizza for just 7.65 plus tax. You can build your own pizza or you can also choose from any of the signature pizzas they have created as well. Plus, they serve beers (:   There were so many toppings and different types of sauces to choose from, so I just went with one of the signature pizzas and added some extra toppings to it. I ordered the white top pizza which consisted of the delicious white cream sauce, mozzarella cheese, bacon, chopped garlic, and oregano. Plus I also added some spinach and sausage as well. Once the order was placed, I didn't even have to wait long. They called my name in a matter of less than five minutes. Warning though, the plate of your pizza is very HOT! So be careful when you're carrying it to the table.   As I bit into the pizza, all the flavors were just right. The sauce and the toppings balanced everything out. Never knew garlic was so good on pizza either! I couldn't even finish the pizza, but I love the fact that boxes were already up for grabs.    Since it was my first time here, the staff were very helpful and answered the questions that I had instantly. They were all so friendly and they even came up to our table to asked if we were doing okay, two thumbs up for their customer service!   Will definitely be back here again! Thank you for the wonderful experience.",

I walked in and (thank god I called ahead) the place was packed.  I mean \"people out the door\" packed.  The only thing that irritated me about when you order on the internet is that they make the pizza but they don't cook it till you get there.  On a night so busy I had to get someone's attention to cook the pizza as the cashier wasn't paying attention to me at all and there was only one of them for some reason.  Now I get that they don't want the pizza cold when you pick it up....but it takes them 3 min to cook the pizza and I live 2 min away.  It took me 10 min to pick up my order.  Not cool.",

When you order here you have the choice of ordering their selection of pizzas which sounded good but I couldn't resist the array of toppings available and chose the build your own pizza. You can get as many toppings as you like for the same price. I decided on the basic red sauce with spinach artichoke hearts,smoked ham and mozzarella cheese. After your pizza is assembled you wait just a few minutes until it is delivered to you nice and hot. It was really good and tasted very fresh. We loved the blood orange lemonade too. There was a guy working in the dining room that was very helpful and nice. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because it was way too noisy in there. I think the music was way loud and everyone was trying to talk over it. So please if you turn down the music a notch this could very well turn out to be my new favorite pizza place!",

When we went in we were immediately greeted and none of the workers seemed miserable to be there which is very refreshing. Although small it still felt spacious enough to not be sitting on your neighbors lap... Also nice. The concept of a \"subway\" for pizza had not going in there not expecting too much but I was extremely pleasantly surprised. I wanted to try the white and the red sauce so the greeter/order guy suggested I have them mix it for a pink sauce. Awesome choice, I got the white out(I think that was the name)with spinach...bacon,chopped garlic,pink sauce and mozzarella. There's was 4 of us, 2 adults and 2 kids. The kids shared a pepperoni, and husband got a half spicy half regular with onion olives and pepperoni. All the combos were great! 3-11\" pizzas 2 drinks for $25 and we all had leftovers. They also provide nutritional values for their menu and gluten free dough and vegan cheese which I think is awesome to cater to so many ppl. I do wonder about their gluten free dough, for the simple fact the kitchen was pretty small and I didn't see multiple mixers for their dough.  Worth double checking if u have an allergy. All in all my novel is done and I had a great experience.",

I don't know why places seem to feel they have to season sauces with heat. Italian sauce should not really have heat. Pizza sauce doesn't need heat. If I want to add red pepper for heat, I will. Put oregano and other spices in and leave out the heat.  The side salads are a ripoff. Highly over priced. Amounts to $4.95 for about half a cup of salad Too expensive for what you get The pizza was good and fast and hot. Flavor was good. They didn't have enough seating for everyone. People who had been there before were saving all the tables for family who were in line. We had never been before and didn't realize we needed to save a table. Overall, food and service were good and will go back. Not fine dining, but, fast dining.",

    "text": "Blaze Pizza. Could it get any worse? I have had Chicago pizza, New York Pizza, Italian style pizza. But what style is Blaze Pizza? Not sure. Blaze Pizza popped up in Henderson and became one of the most overrated pizza places. There are constant fundraisers for needy high schools to try and suck up every last penny they can get as if they don't get enough from taxes. There's Dominos and Papa Johns which are the lower class pizza places but not terrible. Then there's Blaze Pizza. Basically the McDonalds of pizza places. Horrible quickly crafted style pizzas. And the building? Could you have more cameras in here it's as if you are partnered with the FBI. When you pull into blaze be prepared for a huge line of people usually coming out of the door. Once you finally make your way inside you are greeted with loud music and still, a line. Why is this place bad if there is such a long line. Bandwagon and people giving this place another chance after their horrible first visit.  Be greeted by an assembly line of almost factory workers creating your pizza where they overprice their pizza and make it a mission to hold a conversation with you. Do you hate onions? Well guess what? That last worker touched onions all over and now is putting your tomatoes on with the same gloves. Your pizza tastes a lot like onions? All thanks to that worker. How is it not breaking FDA rules not switching gloves each customer. The pizza is poorly crafted on some thin trashy dough and put on with a classic red sauce. Red is a color not a flavor. I have never seen anyone try and do this but blaze. They vary with the amount of cheese they put on every time so you can never get the pizza you want. The sausage is terrible and I don't recommend it to anyone. Last time I had it I ended up finding some cold pieces of undercooked sausage and it was not fun. Blaze pizza brings a \"throw back\" to the American Revolution. Have your factory workers make you the worst slice of pizza you have ever had. I really hope that Blaze goes out of business soon because I am tired of people bringing it up and following the bandwagon of thinking this place is actually good. If you want good pizza go to Grimaldis or Metro. Shaking my head Blaze.",

For under $8 you can get a pizza that you can customize with as many toppings as you like. Hint:Toppings are plentiful and fresh. Don't be afraid to ask for a double serving, some employees have mushrooms on lockdown! A half pizza is enough for me, but when I reheated my leftovers in the oven the next day, it sucked. My man ate all of his pie, but his appetite is bigger than mine. I think the size is just right for guys. Seating is limited but it seems like many take their orders to go.  Enjoy!",

Having it made in front of you is a bonus and it only take about 4 minutes to fire up and get sliced for consumption. The pizza itself is pretty good and the service was excellent.  I hope to go back soon. Recommendations: the spicy sauce adds a zest to the pizza I really enjoyed.",

The first time I went I noticed that the guy who touched my cheese had just handled someone else's meat, so that was a little off putting. After giving them the benefit of the doubt I decided to go back. But this time the women not only touched the meat before touching my cheese but also dropped several pieces of bacon onto my pizza as she scattered it on another pizza. I had to ask someone to remove it because no one noticed or seemed aware of why that would be upsetting. Just feels like their isn't much consideration taken for people who don't want meat/meat residue on their food.",

Check-in with them so they can fire my pizzas = fresh, hot pizzas!  One thing I've noticed though is the amount of oil that's on my pizzas. Top and bottom are oily. This isn't the case at the other locations. I never ask for olive oil drizzle. So, why?   Sure, it's better quality pizza than say Pizza Hut and all those places. The pizzas only come in one size. They have signature pizzas or you can build your own. You have a choice of crust: original or gluten-free. They have different sauces, cheeses, meats, veggies and finishes. They also have salads and a S'more pie for dessert.  My favorites are: Green Stripe or my own creation (white cream sauce + pesto, pepperoni, turkey meatballs, sausage, and ricotta).",

    "text": "The new 'go-to' pizza place, Blaze Pizza has such great potential. After all the pizza is fabulous and consistent. And since you can have them build it your way you should get what you want each time. This is what I come back for, a pizza that is tasty, with a crust that is crunchy and chewy at the same time.   The other key components of a good restaurant are service and image. It is in these areas that Blaze sometimes falls flat.   Their service is usually not terrible but is often loose and inefficient, lackadaisical at best. Their robotic employees seem to just go through the motions most of the time, seeming bored and uninterested in the task at hand. They rarely smile or even look at a customer in front of them. Their main focus always seems to be on how quickly they can get you to no longer stand in front of them. I should point out that there are usually a couple of top notch employees on duty, those who smile and are efficient in what they do, in other words the ones who do actually give a hoot about their job.   Now about the image. The restaurant itself is kept up well and normally meets most customers' expectations. The employees' appearance is quite another story. Blaze seems to pride itself on hiring people who dress like they are still learning that task, with pants hanging below the waist, hats on backwards, plastic beads hanging from necks and arms. Not a big deal right? When you add in all of the tattoos, nose rings, ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant. At one point the most heavily tattooed female was standing on the food line showing each of her tats to a coworker.   These issues could be easily fixed by simply having a responsible adult in charge at all times and being a bit more selective in the hiring process.",

First off, today was busy around lunch time, but the employees worked efficiently and made sure to greet each customer. What REALLY impressed me was when I asked for no cheese on my custom pizza. The girl working asked if this was due to an allergy or if it was a preference. I'm vegan, so I told her it was just a preference, but the attention given to prevent a customer from becoming ill as a result of cross contamination really really impressed me. It was such a simple question, but asking something so simple can be the difference between and life and death for those with food-borne allergies. Excellent service, and clearly, the employees are trained well! I will make sure to stop in more often!!",

The confirmation page will tell you the time to arrive in the restaurant, and that after checking in at the store they'll put it in the over for you, so I ended up waiting five minutes or so for it. I'm glad I ordered online bc there was a line when I arrived. Made my way to the front of the cashier, and that was that!   The pizza itself was good too. Can't beat unlimited toppings for $7.95. My only complaint was that the pizza wasn't crispy like a thin crust pizza. But that could be due a number of things - one is that I drove ten minutes home before I could eat it, and two is that I got the pesto drizzle on top. The pesto drizzle it was good though! There's only one pizza size (11\") and that is probably enough for two (or one if you're a big eater).   Staff was very friendly too. While I was waiting for my pizza, someone on the floor was bussing tables, refilling drinks, asked if he could get me a drink while I waited, etc.   I can't wait to sit on their back patio!",

    "text": "As many have written, you pay $8.27 for your own personal 11\" pizza pie, with as many toppings your pizza can hold and then cooked to a crisp perfection (I always prefer mine extra crispy).  This is a good pricing point for lunch, any more, this place has nearby competition.  Blaze is in the same shopping plaza with fast food competitors like KFC with their $5 fill up, Panda Express with their Chinese combo meals, and Fausto's inexpensive Mexican lunch...  You get my drift.    Onto, why this place deserves 4 stars. Places like Blaze is now catching on in Nevada, similar to the trendy ones in California like Pizza Press in Anahiem, Pieology in Fullerton.  This concept it not new to me, but nonetheless, I'm excited that we have one in Henderson.  All the ingredients are sitting on square and rectangular metal bins.  They look fresh, they taste fresh and the employees, though new, seem to take very good care on placing the toppings evenly on my pie.    You can check out their menu, but they have some of my favorite ingredients like goat cheese, artichoke, arugula, minced garlic, fresh whole basil leaves soaked in water, spicy marinara sauce.  Again, these are just a few of my favorites, there is just so much more to choose from.  So far, customer service is on point and way courteous.  I easily devoured my 11\" pie in one sitting.  Vegan cheese was an extra $2, yikes!  I think they should mention it when offering that option.",

The wait is never too long here although it may get a tad bit busy around noon time during lunch. The workers always greet you upon entrance and I have yet to meet a grouchy associate.   The set-up is similar to chipotle. You order in an assembly line whilst picking and choosing all of the yummy ingredients to put on your pizza. I always get the regular dough and original red sauce to start off. Although I hear the white cream sauce is a great substitute if you're wanting to try something other than red. And then you just go down the line and customize your perfect little pizza. It's fired up at the end and it takes less than 10 mins for it to come out usually.  The drinks (specifically, different types of lemonades) and the desserts (which can be warmed up upon request) are a must!",

    "text": "I was amazed with Blaze! It's a fast food pizza chain that's \"chipoltle-ized!\" Custom build your own pizza is what you can get here.   Build Your Own: 11 inch size.  Any amount of toppings. One price. $7.65 there is additional charge for gluten free and vegan cheese though   What's Cool: The sauces they offer. White cream, pesto drizzle to name a few.  The crust is super thin and crispy, which is less carbs to digest. It held the many toppings I had on there pretty well!   The choices of traditional &  artisanal cheeses they offer like goat cheese, ovalini mozzarella and Gorgonzola.   Fresh veggies and herbs and sea salt for seasoning   and the meats.. well Mr. B likes all the meats and the amount you can add on your pizza   The assembly line starts with choosing what sauce you want on your dough,next cheese, then protein. Then pizza is fire'd and baked in blazing speeds. In about 180 minutes to be exact!   For fast food type pizza, I was impressed with all the fresh ingredients and I was surprised I really liked the finished product.   The menu board offers a bunch of their signature pizzas and salads too.  S'mores are their only choice for dessert.   They won me over when I read they had BEET & Goat cheese salad! Yes Nate M. I am that crazy person that goes into a pizza place and orders something else on the menu because Im not into 'ZA :)   Service was pretty quick and easy. Staff was really friendly and helpful.  If staff were out on the dining area they were nice enough to clear and bus tables and refill our drinks. There's also small pizza boxes readily available to pack up your leftovers.   The place is kind of small and since there is only one line it could get cramped when it's busy. Fast casual,  order and pay and pick up your order at counter. They'll call your name when pizza is done. Seating in the dining area is also small for a fast food joint. If it fills up, there is more tables out on their patio facing Eastern Ave.  Perfect place to have lunch or a light dinner especially during the hot summer months.",

    "text": "Yay for consistency!   It works for sandwiches, burritos, tacos, and now pizza. Blaze is another fast food chain going with the, \"build it yourself\" model. I've been to few a locations in So-Cal; L.A., San Diego, and now Henderson, like I stated before \"yay for consistency\".   The Food. The toppings are fresh and the service is speedy. When you order your pizza can either choose one of the premade pies, which there are nine of, or build your own pizza. Which is what I did; sausage, black olives, basil, spicy marinara sauce, and shredded mozzarella. It was delicious! You have multiple sauce and cheese options, but only type of crust, thin. Remember this place is built for speed not to share an authentic NYC or Chicago style of pizza.   After your pie cooks in a crazy hot oven, your name is called and your pizza is ready, about five minutes total cooking time. Blaze offers salad options for the non-pizza lover, which by the way sounds crazy, I mean who doesn't like pizza?! Thirsty? - Beer or wine can also be purchased if you're not in the mood for soda or water. I went with my favorite, Ballast Point - Sculpin.   Total bill for the meal; one pizza, one salad, two beers and two bottles of water... twenty-eights dollars. Blaze Pizza is keepin' it real, real affordable.",

I'm not a fan of tomato sauce so having the other options are enticing to me. Choose a crust, then a sauce, meats, toppings and extras all for the affordable price of $7+  They also have a stamp card in the form of an app. After 10 purchases, you get one for free. Easily accessible!   After they blaze your pizza, you can add last minute topping to it like pesto sauce, olive oil, etc. They usually have all their options listed on the counter. Take advantage because it's free of charge! You can also ask for ranch on the side or BBQ sauce, etc.",

This normally wouldn't bother me unless it directly impacts the outcome of my food and in a couple of instances it did. The first time the employee was just throwing the items on the pizza and half the ingredients ended up on the counter and the floor. When I asked her for more garlic she had this disgusted look on her face and said loudly \"you want more?!?!?\" Ummmm yea that's what I just said. Jeez. I should have told her if half my toppings weren't on the floor we'd be okay. She also forgot the tomatoes on the red vine pizza. When reminded, she again threw them on the pie. The second time the person finishing the pizza off sent our pies out \"undressed\". No olive oil drizzle on two pies, no arugula on the other.   On a positive note: the other pizza finisher (short haired girl) is excellent. Never misses a beat and is always friendly and accommodating.   I wish they wore name tags....   Five stars for fast fresh tasty food and overall great atmosphere and service. 2 people won't impact the overall experience and blaze is here to satisfy my pizza cravings.",

    "text": "Man this place is bomb!  Literally every time I come here, I alway forget to take pictures! But if you ask me a good spot to get a personalized pizza, I would totally recommend this place in a heart beat!  I love customizing my pizza to fit my cravings, and they have way more options then your usual pizza spots that deliver. I have been here three times and plan in coming here more since it's not to far from my friends house. Every time I come here, I alway opt for the create your own pizza. They have a regular crust and a high rise one. Definitely two good choices depending on your mood for bread! Besides Vodka Sauce, and Regular Marin tomato sauce, they have my favorite Alfredo sauce as an option!  I alway get that with extra cheese, they have more than three cheese and even a vegan cheese!  Next is your toppings- I alway load up on spinach, olives, artichokes, peppers, zucchini, and pepperoni and sea salt!  My little one always grabs a regular cheese pizza, and that's even good. Maybe because they use quality products and cook it in the oven fire grill.  Making the pizzas extra yummy. This location has lots of parking around and at the restaurant, it's located in a shopping plaza right next to Jersey Mike's Sandwich.  You can sit indoor or outdoor, which are both good options, especially when the nights were just right not to cold or hot. So if your ever in the mood for pizza or something different, come on in and grab a personalized pizza.  It's sure to tame the cravings!",

Great thin & crispy crust, and great fresh toppings.  The juice options are also awesome too...   There is a reason this place is always busy.  But the line is never too long (it moves quickly).  Love this place!  *Tip* Although you can put as much topping on it as you want, you probably shouldn't.  When the pizza has too many toppings, it does not come out crispy.  Instead its a soggy droopy mess.  Sometimes more is not always better..",

Their ingredients are ample with a wide range of meats like pepperoni, Italian sausage, chicken; they have fresh veggies, I love the spinach and basil; the cheese! Yummm and they don't stop there, they have just about everything you could want on a pizza. Don't forget their perfectly balanced red sauce, it's one of several.   It's amazing to me they can offer unlimited toppings all for one low, low price. To top it off, they offer a really tasty gluten-free crust that not only tastes good, it holds up all the toppings I put on it. I love pizza but I got tired of ordering and waiting and waiting for it to get done. Not at Blaze! It's ready in just a few minutes. You can't beat them for taste, price and time. Can't wait to go back :)",

My husband, son, and I came here for lunch and we were all very pleased. My 2 year old had the simple pie, husband has the art lover and I had the white top minus the bacon. They ask you if what is going on the pizza is ok and if you want to make an revisions. When you order, all the topics are placed in front of you and it really is fast fired. We had our few within minutes of paying and finding a seat. The blood orange lemonade was really tasty! I've never had that flavor before and totally loved it, I would even come just for that.  The sizes of the pizza are all the same. It was nice that because I did not have the bacon on my pizza, they charged me less--they didn't have to, but what great customer service! All the staff are really friendly and happy. All the pizzas were delicious. I'd love for them to cater!!! Thank you for coming to Henderson!",

We sat outside because it was empty and quiet, that didn't last long. Within 10 minutes every table outside was filled. It was great that it comes super fresh right out of the brick oven. They're individual sized pizzas and very thin crust. It was tasty but nothing memorable. I preferred my husbands pizza and took the rest of mine home. They have to go boxes left out for you to grab at anytime. If you're looking for a family friendly place then this is the place to go. Personally in my opinion, there were too many kids running around like I was at a chucky cheese. With how packed this place was I assumed the pizza was going to be pretty amazing but I feel like I've had much better. Most likely I won't be back.",

As far as local scene goes, Blaze'd really puts the competition on 800 Degrees. I wish the company would build a location in Summerlin. They would put Pieology out of business",

They gave me half an article heart for the whole pizza. I asked for more and they said that's not the policy. The pizzas we ordered were undercooked because it was very busy, so they didn't taste all that great because it was just mushy dough on one side and burned cracker on the underside. We were also the first ones in line and the last to get our pizzas. Probably won't return here based on taste. Bummed about the compounded turnoffs.",

They may not have as many choices for toppings , but they more than make up for it on the price. I wish they would open one in Lake Havasu City. It would make a killing. The only down side to this location is the parking lot is kind of on the small side.",

    "text": "After the experience I had this evening, I needed to write a review. My sister and I decided on this place because it was close to home and had gluten free crust. My sister ordered her regular pizza and I ordered a regular to-go pizza for my husband, both of which only took about 10 minutes to order and cook (very fast considering how long the line was). I was told it would only be a few extra minutes for the gluten free, since they had to make the crust. I waited 28 minutes and still nothing. I decided I was done waiting and asked for a refund because I didn't want the pizza anymore. To my surprise, I was told the crust was ready but they couldn't find me. I was standing in the exact same spot hungrily staring at the counter for 28 minutes. I went through the line for toppings and everyone was sincerely nice and apologetic. The manager was extremely apologetic as well and refunded the money I spent on the gf pizza. Also, one of the other employees, who I don't believe was a manager, handed me a coupon for a free pizza next visit. I understand mistakes happen and I really appreciate how it was handled. Thank you.   The pizza was AMAZING!! Best gf pizza I've had in awhile.",

As soon as I walked in to Blaze I was given a warm friendly greeting by the staff, I was also given an explanation of how the build your own pizza style works. The build your own is $7.95 and the amount of toppings you can add on are unlimited. I used to go to a place on the strip that has this concept, it costs more and the toppings you can get are limited and certain toppings cost extra. I was pleased that the toppings were unlimited. The restaurant is spacious and clean. Blaze also has an outside patio that I will use in future visits once the weather cools down. I thought that the staff was attentive and the pizza was ready very fast, They also have a selection of salads and glutton free pizza for those that want glutton free pizza. Im so glad Blaze is close to where I live. I used to go to a strip casino for this type of Pizza, I wont name the place here, Blaze is the perfect alternative for us locals. I will return",
