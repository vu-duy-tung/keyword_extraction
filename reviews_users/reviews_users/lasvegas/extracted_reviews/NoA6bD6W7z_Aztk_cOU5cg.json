I specifically told the waiter I had Celiac Disease,  he indicated that he understood. My wife ordered spaghetti,  I would say the same strainer for her spaghetti was used for gluten free noodles.  Behind the scene, cross contamination inevitable.   The manager was apologetic and though I didn't pay monetarily for my meal,  I'll pay physically.",

I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos. worst decision ever! The tortillas were very doughey and the rice had barely any taste. So i traded my brother for his Fettucine Alfredo because he didn't like it and you can never going wrong with that right? Wrong! The chicken had zero seasoning along with the pasta in general.  Everyone at my table had something wrong with their food, from hard spinach to doughey pizza.   At the time we got our food it was too late to even ask for them to remake it since they close at 11 pm! Plus we were starving.   The only thing that convinced me to give CCF 2 stars is how friendly the hostess was!",

So let me start by saying that I honestly wasn't a huge Cheesecake Factory \"goer\" if you will but after today that may change and I wll tell you why! I was invited by an old co-worker to come out for some drinks and some snacks! My first thought was Cheesecake Factory? For Happy Hour? Huh!? Yes! No doubt I pulled up the menu online and say a few things that I'd be interested in. Now like any other happy hour menu the options to choose from are minimal however they do offer some great ones! I have to highlight that not only do they offer Long Island Ice Tea's but in TALL glasses! For only $5 I believe! What a steal! I was determined to try every drink but they would've had to wheel my out of there! I was able to also try the margarita and although it wasn't as strong as the Long Island it was still acceptable! Crab Spinach dip is a MUST! Even though the happy hour is only from 4-6PM I would still encourage everybody to check it out! This was my first time to this location and I was impressed! Not just by the food, but the customer service was excellent as well! I wish I could remember the waitress's name, she was a doll! I'll be back for SURE!",

The only two things that were bad was the restroom was broken so the line for women's room was long.

So we just wanted to have a happy family dinner and when we entered there was a waiting list, so we checked in and the front desk said we have to wait for 40 minutes and we said \"Ok, thank you.\" Then we sat down on a couch that is near to the front desk so we can hear them if they call us.            A while later, we asked how many more minutes do we have to wait and this guy told us that we're gonna be called next because we were in front of the line. A few minutes, we still weren't called. So we told another guy that 40 minutes passed already and we haven't been called, so he checked in the computer he said that we've been called 10 times! We were like \"We didn't get called at all!\" We were so near to the front desk and we know we didn't get called.        So we went to the manager and he got us a table and he said that it was no big deal. But it was a big deal, they were lying and unfair because we were a party of 5 and they called parties of 6 ,7, 4. They said that we weren't called just yet because our party was more than a party of 4! They were being unfair and dishonest. I hope my experience help you when you come to this branch.",

I usually don't like Cheesecake Factory because they tend to take a bit longer to serve you, but this time it was super speedy. We ordered some lunch specials and a Shepherd's Pie. The Pie was really good, although it was a bit fancier than some of the Pies I've ordered at other places before. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal. The food was good, the service was good, the speed and price were right -- really, nothing to complain about.

    "text": "I was so excited about the expansion of the Premium Outlets/North, and was even more so, when I heard that this major restaurant was joining the newest shopping wing. Good timing, too. We had a couple gift cards to use.   So, we came here on saturday for lunch, way before the crowd; since we got a tip from one of the ladies here to get in here before 12:15 pm as we were checking out the menu posted outside.   We had the complimentary bread basket  with butter (french baguette slices and pumpernickel slices) and our little man had one too, which also included sliced bananas. I had a bunch of questions about the menu, since it'd been a while. I opted for the lunch size asian salad, while hubby had his favorite item, the cuban sandwich, and our little man had the mini corndogs and fries. It was delicious. I couldn't finish my salad, which was pretty big, even for the lunch size, but I'm glad I asked about the size of the salad. We also got dessert, once I mentioned the crazy one, hubby wanted that one. It was really good, too. I just was stuffed. (We had leftovers.) We still had a balance on one of the gift cards. They are treated as credit cards, so you still have to sign them.   The service was excellent- our server was pretty attentive (drink refills, and checking on us from time to time). And the other servers were nice and smiling, as they passed us, too. It's refreshing to see people in customer service who want to be there, who enjoy their jobs.     Inside, the decor (barqoue/neo-classical- elegant), was very in line with their other restaurants (been to Forum/Summerlin/Green Valley). We had to switch seats (booth & tables seating is available) as the TV had hubby's game that he was DVR'ing. Our stoller was stored with the rest, elsewhere. The lady gave us a claim ticket.   Bathrooms were near the entrance. There were mens, womens, and a family one. I went into the womens and there were two stalls, one was handicapped. I went into the smaller one so I don't know if there was a baby changing station in the handicapped stall.   The food court at this Premium Outlets is really lacking (Ok, who am I kidding, it sucks!), so this restaurant is going to be very busy and popular (the huge menu and the huge selection of cheesecake flavors). Hubby mentioned that this could be one of our special occasion restaurants. Our first date was at the one at Forum Shops (back in 2004). So, yes, we will be back. It's a yummy place.",

So I was surprised when along with their regular menu, we were given a \"Skinnylicous\" one. It was so exciting! They listed all their food options and most of them are below 600 calories! Score!  We ordered appetizers and I settled with the Skinnylicious burger. It was surprisingly good! You would think that something like that would be more than 600 calories at least. I am really glad that they have this option available. I might consider dining here again if I'm in the area and not be scared that I have no other options but unhealthy ones.",

    "text": "Must-do update...  After speaking with a representative of the Cheesecake Factory corporate office, I opted to give another location a shot. Checking out the franchise on Rampart in Summerlin, I was pleasantly surprised. We took my lovely mother in law, who is as notoriously hard to please as my beautiful wife and a really good time was had by all. Impeccable service and the entrees arrived as expected and quite good. Trust me when I say that the flavor profile the manager was going for at the Outlet Shops location was NOT what was served in Summerlin. Night and day, really.   I'm not saying to patronize one location over any other and I'm not saying I'll be rushing back to another Cheesecake Factory, but I'm glad corporate talked me into a return visit because if all I knew was the sloppy service and the slop on the plate at the Outlet Shops I'd do whatever I could to steer y'all clear.  That run on sentence notwithstanding, second chances can be a good thing.",

When we asked when it will arrive, the response was: \"when it's ready\"!  Okaaaay!!!   And then after we ordered a different appetizer, 20 minutes go by then the manager ( I think) comes by to say: sorry folks.  We won't have that item till tomorrow.  WTF!!????   You know, when we walked in at 7 pm on a Friday night we were sat right away.  Initially I was shocked.  But after the worst service and food, I understand why.  This was by far the worst Cheesecake AND worst restaurant I have been to. EVER.   Stay away. They need to close down.  Really they do!  Awful.   Keep your money and spend it gambling! At least you'll have fun while watching your money go away to someone else's pocket!!!!!",

The server was really nice and said there was one more left and comes back and says it was actually a mistake and there wasn't any. I asked to speak to the manager and Heather came and spoke to us saying it's not his fault there wasn't any which, of course it wasn't, but instead of apologizing for the mix up or trying to offer me another option she raised her voice and asked \"well did you specifically ask for it right when you sat down?\" Of course I didn't? I didn't appreciate her tone or how she approached the situation. I'm honestly just really bummed about there not being my favorite cheesecake but how the management treated me, I'm more upset about it. Point is, they need to work on their customer service.",

    "text": "Here's a simple transaction gone stupidly wrong.  A man walks into a Cheesecake Factory 30-minutes to close. The place is less than half full, so it's not busy by any measure. All this man wants is to order two slices and to go home. He stands in front of the display case, as one does, waiting to ask a question and to then place an order.   And he keeps standing there.   There's one busy bee who's pulling all the weight filling orders as the dupes roll in. She's far too preoccupied, that is clear. Then there's the other, standing at the register, pretending to be busy. She looks at me on occasion, we make eye contact, and it's clear, I need help, and she's not busy, nor is she coming over. Maybe it's not her job? Maybe she's been scolded for leaving her register? I don't know. It's not my job to know.  I wait a few more minutes watching the hustle. One manager comes in and gives the busy bee an understanding kiss on the head. Odd. Neither here nor there, though. I eventually walk over to the one whose feet are stuck at the register. She asks if I need anything. Incredulous, I say yes, and a question, but is there a reason you didn't come over when you saw me standing there forever?   \"I was busy.\"  No. No you weren't. And your muscles could have transported you over three feet to meet a customer. Anyway, I place my order, and there's not an ounce of hospitality in her voice or actions. No civility. Cold dismissiveness. I thank her for taking my money, but she continues to stand there. My cheesecake? No. She eyeballs the guy standing beside me, then back at me. Am I supposed to interpret this eyeballing? She then snarks at me to move, that, \"I need to take his order.\"   \"THAT's interesting,\" I say. She has to take *his* before completing mine, after I've been standing there for ten minutes already. And how does that rule work if the line is more than two customers deep?  Have I wronged this woman somehow, in a past life perhaps? Just unreal. It's like she was stickin' it to me. For what? For being a customer?   While waiting for the next guy to place an infinitely long order before receiving mine, I see another manager come by. I tell HIM what just happened. He apologizes, which is nice, and he collects my cheesecake and hands it to me. Apologizes again. All that's well and good...but what are you going to do about that staffer (Sharonte, the receipt claims)? Let her look at me smugly as I leave, which she did, and let bygones be bygones?   Bad service is bad service, happens from time to time. But this felt weirdly personal, and as if no one cared whatsoever. Looking at other negative reviews, there's an obvious pattern here, as well as the textbook response from Management. Maybe try fixing your service issues instead of endlessly apologizing for them?  This Cheesecake is less than a mile from my house, but there's no way I'll ever return, not with that welcoming and sendoff as if I'd been punished for some unknown transgression.   Cheesecake splurge mood: spoiled. Rotten.",

But I ordered a Factory Combo for $22.95 which I thought was a great deal for the Herb Crusted Salmon, Mashed Potatoes, and a Shrimp Scampi... the kind with the noodles. This should have been called \"Breaded Shrimp and Cream Sauce.\"   Anyways the mashed potatoes were good but I wanted gravy. The Herb Crusted Salmon was alright. I didn't really like the crust, a bit too bitter for my taste. The breaded shrimp was good and the cream sauce was fine. I really hated the sauce that came underneath my salmon and asparagus, I'm so very glad that they put the asparagus between my salmon and the sauce so that it wasn't already touching and I was able to save it. I love asparagus and mine were ruined. :(  My boyfriend ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger, it was fine. He asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it was quite well done.   We ordered Chicken Samosas for our appetizer and I thought the cilantro dipping sauce was quite wonderful. I thought the samosas were pretty good.  The star of the show was...   The complimentary wheat bread!! Omg. It was soooo amazing. It was so warm, nice and toasty... it melted in my mouth, no butter neeeded. It was sweet and just so so amazing. I ate one whole piece and half of the second piece. I wanted to eat it all but of course I had to share, lol and I didn't want to ruin my appetite!  Of cooourse we had to order a cheesecake since we were at The CHEESECAKE Factory! There were so many to choose from I wanted to try em all but we both only had enough room in our bellies to only share one!   After a long time of trying to decide we chose the Turtle Pecan Cheesecake, it had a yummy brownie crust but not enough pecans. We took off the big chocolate mousse thing, it was better without it.  We needed to check out Cheesecake Factory since everyone loves this place but we just weren't really big fans! The food was just mediocre at best and the service was slooooow.",

It is a Tuesday night at 6 PM and our waiter tells us they are out of a stuffed mushrooms appetizer, then we order loaded tater tots and they are out of that as well. My son then orders his Mac & cheese burger and they tell us they are out of it. Now, wait a second, I am in the Food Distribution business and I know they get deliveries from their Food Distributor Monday, Wednesday, & Friday. So, do not try and tell me you are out of this. So, 3 times you told this table of 9 customers, \"NO\"! Is that part of The Cheesecake Factory customer service strategy? I would bet not. So, let's top this off with my wife's Ahi Tuna salad, the tuna was bad and she could not eat it. My son orders Godiva Cheesecake to go and guess what, you got it, they where out. Unbelievable!! Worse service ever and disappointing in the fact that we spent over $300 for this.... This is why you should spend on independent restaurants. The Kitchen Manager & Executive Chef should be embarrassed as they dropped the ball on their inventory and quality of food.",

They can be a bit slow when they're super busy and being in the outlet, they're usually busy. However, I've never had major problems with the service. If you don't want to wait to be seated, you can seat yourself in the bar area as those seatings are on a first come first serve basis. Love their wheat bread and they will gladly give you extra if you ask. My favorite dish here is their miso salmon. They also offer great happy hour.

But I was over on this side of the town and decided to place a to-go order. So I called in to get a 4 cheese pasta with chicken for pickup and they said 15-20 minutes. Which wasn't a problem. However I got there in 10 minutes and just let them know I was there but they already had it ready for me. So I think they rushed cooking it. But I didn't pay much attention to it. But when I finally got home to try it out. It had a burnt taste to it. At first I thought it was from the to-go container and hot food mixing that threw off the taste but it was just overall burnt tasting. Hopefully next time I don't experience this because that was pretty disappointing. Other than this situation I've never had a problem with Cheesecake Factory.",

    "text": "Review #099 - 2017  My friend and I were walking around the outlet and got hungry in the middle of our shopping trip so we decided to head over to the Cheesecake Factory for a quick lunch.  We showed up around 1:30 PM for lunch and were seated within 5 minutes.    I felt really terrible because we were walking for quite a while before my friend told me that she was starving.  I'm such a bad friend!  Our waitress came to greet us and brought us some iced water.  We ordered an appetizer and one item each and decided to share everything.  I wanted to try the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks as our appetizer, and I am so glad that it turned out to be really good or else I would've been really disappointed since my friend told me to choose.  She ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and asked if she could have a side of salad, but I told her that I was going to order the factory chopped salad and she could just share some of mine.  Good thing we decided to share everything because their portions are no joke.  We enjoyed everything we ordered.  Service was pleasant and our food arrived in a timely manner.  Our only complaint was that the air conditioner was probably set to 40 degrees or something since it was 90+ degrees out and the temperature difference was so drastic that it made it hard to enjoy the environment.",

But then again, once you've eaten at one Cheesecake Factory, you've eaten at them all.   The lovely bartender took and made our drink orders straight away. We ordered a passion fruit mojito and a Long Island Ice Tea. Total with tip came to be about $25.  The mojito was deliciously served in a tall Pilsner glass. The fresh mint leaves was a refreshing treat. The LIIT was also good, with a heavy pour, but then again it's a LIIT.",

    "text": "I remember makin' my way Downtown (sorta) when this Cheesecake Factory opened. I wasn't impressed. They messed up my order and the Mac and cheese was not up to par with the one at Caesar's. I didn't have high expectations for my return, but what can I say, it's the mediocre yet deliciously free bread that keeps me coming back.   I brought a friend to share a plate with me. She had her doubts about sharing since she was starving, but I know my way around a Cheesecake Factory. We ordered the chicken costoletta and swapped out the side of veggies with a side of mac and cheese. If you haven't tried the mac and cheese at CF, do so immediately, it might restore your faith in them. The serving size was huge, of course, and we were unbutton-the-pants full. It was awesome. I had plans to buy a cheesecake slice, but we were meeting up with our friends and I didn't want any vultures stealing my cheesecake, you know how it is. Our server was very nice and very knowledgeable, I wish I had gotten her name.   Only downside of this trip: host said 10-15 minute wait and we waited over 30. We almost left, but that mac and cheese was calling my name. Have I mentioned the mac and cheese yet?   ... mac and cheese.",

They also have amazing free bread they give out as well. This location is located in the north outlet mall. If you can find where the street \"symphony\" is at the mall, that is where the restaurant is located. Parking garage is located right across the street and parking is FREE! Woohoo. Great place for a date night or any kind of meal. They have a huge menu offering a lot of different stuff, and a huge cheesecake menu!",

Each of us had pasta and the pasta was cold and stuck together. I had shrimp (five of them) with my pasta and it tasted as though it may have been cooked yesterday. The server was okay, but he delivered our entrees at different times. Perhaps my pasta wasn't cold and sticky enough yet. Forty dollars for no-so-good two entrees and one drink is also a bit pricey, but I guess the marketing must be paid for as it seems they aren't spending good money on food product. Too pricey for less than mediocre and truth be told, if the bill were only twenty dollars, it would still not be worth the quality of food delivered to us - at separate time!",

I had the pear and endive salad from their low calorie menu. It is not on the regular menu,  I allowed for a side of balsamic dressing as the low cal version is tasty but needed a tad more.  I'm not a drown your salad type of salad eater but adding a spoonful more didn't hurt anything, the salad was fantastic.  My hubby had the Imperial chicken dinner with white rice and fried shrimp.  The chicken was delictible it melted in my mouth.  Because we were going to get cheesecake we didn't order or normal appetizer which is the avocado egg rolls.  If you ever want something off the chart order some of these and you will be happy you did.  The new location was convenient to shopping and parking.  The soda  machine was out so we ordered water with lemon it was very good not that normal yuck restaurant water..  We got the cheesecakes to go and we are super stuffed.  Oh yeah please request James as your waiter, he was amazing and we were so impressed with his service and suggestions.  He made our meal even more enjoyable we will be back.",

    "text": "We went to Dinner after shopping. I was excited hadn't had Cheesecake Factory in a long time. Wait time was nothing as it was late already around 8:30ish. We were seated just off the Bar kind of an add place for us since we had a  Child in our group, but ok. First here's the bad stuff. My glass looked like a 2 year old washed it. It was gross, not only was the glass cloudy you could feel the grit of old food on it. When we quietly pulled our waitress to the side to let her know. she said \" Oh I'll get you another one\" it was like this was expected or happens all the time. No apology at all. 2nd we ordered our food and waited about an hour for our meal. It was good could have been better could have been worse. The wait time for our dinner  was long and it wasn't very busy. Our waitress was less then attentive and we had to ask several times for a refill or for the Bud light my husband ordered. . The lady behind us was using a flashlight to show the waitress her steak was under cooked. Now for my favorite Part Cheesecake!!!  we ordered 5 slices to go as we were all tired and ready to go home. All of it was good as we all shared the next day. We may have actually stayed and ate in the restaurant if we didn't wait so long for our dinner. All and All it was decent. My Husband was disappointed that when he asked about onion rings he was shot down. But the food was good. Might try again might not just depends.",

I placed a take out order three times since this location opened and all three times I had to wait.  On one occasion I swore they placed the order as I got there like they forgot to put it in as I watched her pushed her buttons on her screen as she reread my order to confirm.  She then proceeded to give me my lemonade I ordered while I waited another 30 minutes (total of 1 hour wait since I ordered) for my food to arrive.  I'm sure a lot of mall employees that orders food from here are on a timed lunch so it is very imperative they get their shit together.",

    "text": "Been to the Cheesecake Factory on the strip and on Rampart and the food was amazing and service was excellent. Paid $8 to valet just to eat at the Cheesecake Factory at the outlet mall sat at the bar top. I have been gone for a week traveling for work so it was the first time my husband and I got to sat down and catch up with each other and we decided to go here for lunch. Bartender was not friendly seemed to be inconvenienced that we sat down at the bar to eat. The lady who brought our bread was nice but the bread was burned. My husband enjoyed his turkey burger but my shrimp pasta was not good at all the shrimp was very rubbery and overcooked and the asparagus was not very good and limp. Bartender never came back to ask how our food was or I would have politely told him that I did not like my entree which he should have known as I did not finish it. He must have been in a rush to get us out of the bar as he already presented us our bill before we even got our entree in a glass cup in front of us!!! At the end of the meal my water glass was empty and did not even ask to refill it therefore we just paid the check and left. It is very unfortunate for the money I spent on our lunch to not only be satisfied with the food but also the service. Lastly we sat at the end of the bar by the well or the servers pick up the drinks and unfortunately it was surrounded by fruit flies as I kept swatting them away from our area of the bar. Wish I could have gotten our $40 back for this meal.",

Yesterday 07/16/17 I ordered factory burrito grande over the phone at 12:13pm and I was told that it would be 15 to 20mins so I went there 5mins early and payed for my order. For a sunday the place not crowded yet because theres no waiting time to be seated for a dining customer. 25mins had passed still my order not ready yet. So I asked the cashier politely \"can i follow up my order its been 25mins now?\". She said \" I will ask the other cashier what's the status\"? and never return back to me . Now its more than 30 of waiting, I approached a manager whats going on? He said let me follow up with that , as I looked at him walking towards the kitchen a fellow employee talk to him and forgot bout my order. This location is very disorganize and lack of sense of urgency regarding customer waiting for a long time. i always order food from the ceasars palace brance but their service are always good!!!",

First she never went to our table to greet us, then when I finally went to the hostess she told the server that we had been there for over 20 min, then she came with an attitude to get our drinks and walk away without even ask if we were ready to order, when she came we told her that we were ready for some appetizer and she said well I'm not ready yet! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?! With our food I ordered a burger with a salad instead and the salad never made it to the table, with our dessert we want it the chocolate cake with a chocolate milk shake split for 2, that never happened! In the end really disappointed and upset! Never again I'm going there.",

My boyfriend and I have been  there for the grand opening, and we have been there many times since mostly for the convenience.   EVERY time we've been there it has been a disappointment!  The food was low quality and I especially remember how disgusting the restrooms were!  We were convinced it was a CF in name only, the employees didn't care  and the owners were not going to make ANY effort to provide the great food and customer service of others because it's in a 'tourist spot.' Tonight we were pleasantly surprised!  I ordered the Tuscany chicken, it was hot and flavorful.  My boyfriend's chicken Madero was just how he ordered and he ate all of it.  When I went to the restroom, there was someone cleaning it and filling the TP!  Our server had a large party in our section due to a bday, but she handled it like a pro and was super attentive.  FINALLY, we feel it's the REAL CF and will come back! The only complaint I have is we ordered a piece of the 6 layer chocolate cake to go, it was cut sloppily and not very big, other than that was good.",

The medallions where booked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned perfectly, the salad was huge and more than enough for two. Since it was a practice run our server was immensely nervous. We waited a while, but thankfully I had time to spare. The food did take a little while to get to us , but that can be expected in a practice service. All in all our server was attentive and pleasant. For a hundred dollar tab on them all I can say is thank you Cheesecake  Factory!",

But we decided to go ahead and eat. The 10 minutes came and went and no one was left to be seated and our name was not called. The callers were too soft spoken considering the loud volume of the overhead music. We were immediately seated when we pointed out to them that our name had not been called, they shuffled for a table. The waitress asked if we wanted water and left one napkin, there were two of us when I requested two waters and had to repeat it when she was leaving the table. We left. The chitter chatterring flirting going on in the front kept those young ladies from doing their jobs it appeared. As we left they said have a nice day. Did they not notice we were just seated and were now leaving. Good thing most of their business comes from tourists, we will not go back as Las Vegas locals. Really No stars!",

We ended up asking for a different table on the patio and I completely understand having to deal with picky guests as I too work in the restaurant business, but if we had been offered the patio from the beginning we would have politely declined.  Our server Skyler was AWESOME though. He had all the answers to the questions we had about the menu. He never looked bored or like he wanted us to hurry up. He was very attentive and we never had to ask for refills. In the end, I would say we were very well taken care of by Skyler.",

So I called and the manager at the time said they don't normally take reservations but she would enter us in for a party of 16. A  few weeks passed and I called to confirm our reservation for Dec 18th. The person over the phone said they would be ready for us at 8. The day of our dinner I have employees show up at 7.48pm and the host lets them know they don't do reservations. My employees call me since I was running a little late and they said they wouldn't seat them. After 3x of explaining to the host she finally opens a book (were they keep reservations ) and noticed they had a reservation for us. I finally arrived and spoke with the manager in which he did apologize and said we would be seated in 30 minutes. After waiting till almost 9 we were finally seated and it postponed our meeting so much. The host in the front who seats you seemed like we were just a bother the whole time. She came across really rude and thigh the manager seemed apologetic, there was nothing offered or done to show some sort of customer service appreciation. Once we sat down the waiter was good and the food tasted great. I am really disappointed on how their expectation of customer service at the front. As we were leaving one of my employees decided to order an extra cheese cake and they said \"next time order with your waiter because they get commission.\" I can honestly say there may not be a next time. Thought their food is great, their service needs a lot of work  ( I added another star since the owner reached out and apologized. Thank you for caring !)",

At least once or twice a month and have never had an issue until tonight!!!!   My sister arrived earlier than me and decided to to score a booth in the bar area where the hostess came and shooed her out of the booth. The hostess then proceeds to advise her that she was only allowed to sit at the bar in order to participate in happy hour even though none of the booths were occupied. I was very confused because we have sat in booths in the bar area several time and never encountered an issue.   Finally I arrive and wanted to speak to a manager because it didn't seem right and inconsistent. Well here comes Sam....whom was extremely rude to us. He wasn't interested in anything we had to say and accused us of complaining. I told him we weren't complaining and was just curious of the inconsistency and I really didn't want to sit at the bar in order to be able to order off of the happy hour menu. He then tells us to go to another restaurant like Brio so my sister then tells him \"it feels as if you don't want us here, like you're trying to get to get rid of us!\" He continued to be rid so ultimately we left and found our new favorite spot Wolf Gang Puck in Summerlin.   I called to corporate office the next day and spoke with a gentleman who took down my concern and contact information and I waited a month and still no response. I ended up calling corporate again where they issued me $20 eGift card which I ended up using at the San Francisco CCF. I will not be going back to the CCF. I don't like how they handle customers or their concerns.",

The restaurant was fairly busy even in the middle of the afternoon, but I was seated immediately (easy when you are a party of one). The interior was semi-upscale and clean, like most Cheesecake Factory locations.  I originally was greeted by a female waitress who said she would be right with me, but then I ended up being waited on by a young male waiter instead. He was very friendly, but it was clear that he was very new and probably in training. For some reason, he removed my set of utensils and napkins, so I had to ask for a new knife to spread butter when my bread basket came. The bread was fairly tasty: warm and two varieties.  I ended up ordering the eggroll sampler as well as the avocado toast. Both dishes were good, though the avocado spread on the toast was a bit tart. I was actually pretty stuffed after finishing both dishes, so had to take my strawberry cheesecake slice to-go to eat later.  My water was inconsistently refilled, and it took A LONG time for my check to come, and even longer for the bill to come back after I gave my credit card and gift card/coupon.   Though the service during this meal was a bit below average, the food was still decent and I would consider this a solid Cheescake Factory.",

So I walked away from the bar to grab a table.  I got sat and I was restarting my meal. My waitress was Nicole and she was so so sweet. She advised me her honest opinions on one of these features drinks and I was not let down. I ordered the eggrolls unsure if I wanted a meal.

We went to celebrate my mothers birthday, tried to call ahead to make reservations but they do not take any. Thankfully it was not busy and our party of 9 got seated right away. Our server was great, but I honestly cannot remember his name :( He was asian, wore glasses and I think his name could have been Han or something like that.   Food was good, everyone order something different.  I had their combination plate with my favorite thing ever, herb crusted salmon. Came with a creamy lemon sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes. For the second thing I got their steak diane. I forgot how it tasted and I was craving mushrooms so decided to get it. Let's just say that I did not enjoy it, as I thought I would.  We had some buffalo chicken strips that were really good.  And my boyfriend had their jambalaya with shrimp, sausage and not sure what else but it was tasty. Packed with a lot of flavor. Only downfall was that they had ran out of white rice, so they gave him brown rice.  For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake....eh I do not like red velvet so I am not even going to review this dessert. All I can say is, it was a huge slice.   As we were finishing dinner, they brought out a little ice cream sundae for my mom, as they sang Happy Birthday. Over all everyone had a great experience.",

A few bites in I peeled back the bread and realized it was indeed pretty overdone. A handful of the fries were also so overdone and I could hit them against the plate to hear an audible noise with the fry not even breaking. When I brought attention to the food I still had to pay for it and instead got a free slice of cheesecake. In my opinion that's not fair because I paid $13 for the sandwich and got a slice of $8 cheesecake? To me that doesn't make sense nor does it make me want to come back.",

When seated waitress very polite i don't remember her name though. Takes drink orders & was on top of our refills for the sodas. Also i guess we get complimentary bread which was delicious. Now appetizers i ordered the macNcheese balls in marinara which was excellent. My bro had taquitos which he said were hot lol... Main course bro had chicken parm sandwich looked big came with fries. He said was good. I had meatloaf came with garlic glazed corn or something mashed potatoes & mushroom gravy All delicious!!! Definitely will be back for more. Was too full next time will try dessert.",

And we waited, and waited. Mind you no one had acknowledged that we were there. Bussers, waiters, would walk by, and nope not even a \"Hi, have you been helped, yet?\" Nothing. So after maybe 20 minutes of waiting we finally grab a waiter walking by and ask to speak to a manager there. Again, another 10 minutes. When she did show up, I was suprised. Very unproffesional. Very, very unprofessional. Like she didnt care. So it turns out the reason we were just there, sitting was because the \"section\" was closed... Horrible experience. Dont go there. The waiters dont care. The manager didnt care. Dont go there.",

I went with my mother and my daughter there for dinner.  I ordered my meal and coffee.  I asked for cream when my coffee arrived, and kept asking many times for it. At least 20 minutes later, still no cream.  My coffee was cold.  I checked with my server again.  He told me \"Just wait\".  The tables around us came after us were all served.  I was still waiting for my cream.  I then told my server to bring me a fresh cup of hot coffee when he brought the cream.  Another 10 minutes later, my cream was finally delivered without the hot coffee.  I asked him \"Where was my fresh coffee?\" He answered \"We had to brew it\".  I asked \"How long?\".  He ignored me by pretending not hearing.  Rather than wasting my time, I paid and left.  I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory, I live in Summerlin and always frequent that location.  When I shop at the Forum Shop, I go to that Cheesecake Factory, but never will I visit this location again.",

    "text": "Overall the waiter was great until the food came. My kale salad was salty. We sat next to the kitchen and the salad was sitting for some time. By the time the dishes came the buffalo blast were over fried as if the grease was old.  So the server took it back. Within 2 minutes they brought out the same blast that I just sent back. When they finally brought the blast out they looked the same.  If anyone has ever had an order of buffalo blast they are very light with a hint of chicken and a blast sauce inside.  So of course I didn't want them 20 minutes later.  The bun on the bacon burger was hard as if it was stale. The bacon burger had 2 strips of regular bacon and literally 2 small squares of applewood bacon ;(. When the waiter brought out the check he took off the order for the blast but added an order of buffalo wings that no one ordered.  The only thing that was worth the trip was the bread and butter. Of course the check was adjusted but we were really disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory.    Thank goodness for Winchells being open 24 hours. The wings are amazing",

    "text": "First time going,  after hearing a new location opened up, and having heard such great things about them in general ,me and my family (6 of us) decided we would finally see for ourselves. Well from the moment we sat down to the moment we left (almost running out the door) we had the most disappointing experience. John M. was our server and came to take our drink order first,  everyone else ordered soft drinks and i ordered a apple cider,  5 minutes later drinks arrived except mine, was told it was coming next,  10 more mins passed was asked if anyone had brought my cider yet and was again told \"right away\" another 5 mins passed before i received my drink only to receive a glass half the size as everyone else's and with no ice at all, (room temperature apple juice). Finally we all put in our orders, 3 of us ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with a mix of chicken and shrimp , after waiting 45 mins we were served. The pasta was already starting to harden, the chicken had no flavor, the shrimp was chewy and the Alfredo sauce was watery, as if the pasta was not strained all the way. At the end 5 of us were very disappointed with our meal and our server noticing our not too pleased faces decided to ask the manager if he could comp 2 desserts. Dessert was the only thumbs up we gave for the night, but even dessert couldn't stop us from wanting to run out of there! I agreed with my sister when she said \"never again!\"",

    "text": "Food is fine and tastes the same as all other Cheesecake Factory's.  That is not the issue.  The issue I have is the way this location was designed.  The front door is near valet to the mall where only 100 cars can park. The other 10,000 parking spaces are located elsewhere and lead directly into the mall.  But the back door to the Cheesecake factory is closer to the actual mall and much more convenient for people to enter and leave the restaurant.  Half the seating in this location is located in the row going from the check-in to the back door.  And this is the only seating where they allow children.  So as your eating you literally have 100's of people walking back and forth past your table to enter and leave the restaurant.  No one uses the front door since it leads out to the street and the mall is the other direction.  Now add a stroller with a sleeping baby in it.  We usually ask for a table away from others so our child is not a distraction.  We know what it was like before we had a child.  But this place was packed and we had to take the only available table which was a booth.  So we placed the stroller plush against the front of the booth since our child was asleep.  But now with 100s of people coming in and out the back door we closed traffic to one way since the stroller was there.  Now the manager noticed the interruption of bodies moving because of the stroller and was about to ask us to move it down the hall when he realized our son was asleep in it.  So I asked him to make the back door an exit only like most businesses.  And he tried explaining it is a fire hazard which is not True.  it is only a fire hazard if it is locked and you can not get out.  So this meal was certainly not relaxing and not enjoyable.  Trying to make sure people do not run into the stroller and eat at the same time is not fun.  They are more worried about losing customers because they cant actually find the front door to this location than making the people their comfortable.  And if they had told us from the get go their was no place to sit with a stroller we would have gone somewhere else. Lola's is across the street and has the best cajun food around.",

We got 2 Bacon- Bacon cheeseburgers which were big with some fries, the teriyaki chicken, a cheese pizza for one of the kids, grilled cheese sticks for another and mini corndogs for the last one. They were all good. The teriyaki chicken was a bit dry and needed a little bit more favor added to it, the pineapple that came with the chicken was super sour so wasnt touched after I tried it, the mini corndog meal for the kids were just three little things on a stick with a tiny bowl of fruit and that was gone in no time and the kid was still hungry. (News flash some kids eat more then others.. the kids menu goes from I wanna say 4 to 10 years old.. but that is too little for a 9 year old.. come on). The service could have been a little better we were sitting there a good 20 minutes before we could even get dessert. The kids hot fudge sundae was just two tiny ( barely there )scoops of icecream with a little bit of chocolate chips, and fudge on it and cost $3.50 ( again some kids can eat more). But besides all that. It was a very interesting place and we will be back soon.",

I told him that I would need some ketchup to put on my hamburger and at least 15 minutes passed until he came back with the ketchup and at which time he said... I'll get those sweet potato fries ordered for you. I told him to forget it as it was too late. We were already done eating and were ready to leave. I asked him for a to go container for my daughter's barely uneaten entree and again 10 minutes later I had to ask a busboy to bring one over.

His chicken sliders were lukewarm and stale also. Our entrees came out 15 minutes after his and everything on our plates was lukewarm. We waited over an hour. Then the mgr comes over, introduces himself and states that he could have our food reheated. WTF? I don't want lukewarm stale food to be reheated. We just wanted fresh hot food. At this point we decided to leave. After ruining my fiancee's Mother's Day, they douche bag mgr still charged us for our drinks and appetizer. We will never revisit this location ever again and possibly never another cheesecake factory ever. Mother's Day only comes around once a year and ours was ruined by inconsiderate and unempathetic management. The one star is for Peter the server because he rocked.",

And being Vegas locals why not go to the new one so that we can shop at the outlets right after. Lets start off by saying I'm 9 months pregnant so waiting for food for too long is not my best friend. We came in and it took a second to be greeted by the host because she found whatever she was doing to be more important. After she was done she did greet us and we waited to be seated. Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren't offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied \"oh I'm your server give me a minute they seated three of y'all at once\". First that's very unprofessional, second don't think that because we're both African american that I'll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests. So of course I took my business elsewhere so thanks a lot for wasting my time that I can never get back and ruining my birthday and I will be sure to yelp you folks as well. Very poor customer service",

Our waiter was sweating you could see it on his forehead. He seemed overwhelmed which made us not want to ask for anything however we did ask for more bread which he forgot about and we never rec'd. We were overcharged on our bill for wine.  Last year we came at the same time Black Friday and the food, service whole experience was perfect! Don't know what happened this year.",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate my nieces birthday huge mistake! We arrived at 845 and we're seated pretty quickly for a party of 10, it wasn't that busy. That's where the best part ends. It took about 15 min for the waiter Nate to get to our table to even ask for our drink order. Another 10 min pass before our order is taken and 10 min later he returns to inform one of our guests they are out of fried zucchini.... ok no problem.  Now 30 min pass and waiter informs a guest that they are out of steak... WTH.. At this point we are getting pretty hungry and you know they bring all food out together sooo further delay. An hour has passed and I get up go to the front and ask for a manager. Manager Rob appears and I explain we have been waiting an hour and the 30 min delay in finding out they were out of steak. He tells me that the order hadn't been back there long as if I were lying, I was literally pissed! He proceeded to say he would look into it.   I see him in the kitchen area talking to his staff and after another 15min some of the food starts appearing. Crazy part mine appeared last.  Some birthday celebration I lost my appetite.      Needless to say I will never return. Maybe smaller parties have better luck but this service was horrible.",

I got the top shelf margarita to start and hubby got the regular margarita(not sure what he was thinking)- mine was better, very good by the way!For dinner, I ordered the chicken francaise, the kids had pizza, the other had the spicy chicken sandwich( don't remember the name, sorry) off the adult menu, coconut chicken. We then proceeded to have dessert. All the kids, and their Aunt, ordered cheesecake( birthday cake and peanut butter), dad ordered the brownie sundae- he doesn't like cheesecake(his loss our gain). They all liked the,even my son who doesn't like cheesecake- he had the oreo one.  Everything was a hit. They sang to my daughter and put a candle in her cheesecake.  Great place! A little dark but a great place! I would definitely go back every day!",

    "text": "M'kay, so, like - I'm probably one of only five other people on the PLANET who'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Why?  Dunno - just haven't, sue me.  Well, this location is in the Vegas Premium outlet center and after losing my mind in Michael Kors and other stores, it was time to eat and get out before I had to get a 2nd mortgage on my house to support my shopping habit.    Anyhoo - the atmosphere is nice, decor is great - the low marks I give this are for the 1) service and 2) regular food.  I have been to the sister spot, Grand Lux and GL seems to be better to me.  As far as service, our waiter was SLOW and had attitude.  It took forever to just get water, he forgot to bring bread to our table and when I told him one of the things I wanted was for to-go he got snippy with a 'you should have said that first' - UM, excuse me?  Anyway, the salad I ordered to eat there was over chopped - that may be weird to say but I like to see whole leaves in my salad - this one was over chopped like shredded lettuce in the store.  But it tasted good.  My friend ordered these buffalo chicken tenders that for some reason had the buffalo sauce on the inside - nah - I gotta skip that in the future, that's just not right to do to chicken.   BUT - the Turkey burger is BAE!!!  That tasty somenother gave me LIFE!!!!!  The caramelized onions on it are the thing dreams and rainbows are made of...... mind you I ate this later on in the day in my hotel room after several rounds of drinks but trust me, my taste buds know good burgers even if they are reheated.   There is location near my house and I intend on stopping in to grab some cheesecake (the one thing I did NOT do on this visit) - so we'll see if I feel better about them then.  Otherwise, pass for me, I'll Grand Lux it out.",

I used to catch the #11 bus downtown transfer get on the trolley from EAST San Diego to Fashion Valley Mall that's how serious it WAS and IS!  B So on to the review:  I really like this new location at the premium outlets, $6 for valet parking (so worth it).  Just like other CF locations there was a wait to be seated in the restaurant area BUT the bar area is open availability.    The lunchtime options is more than enough food for a lunch portion.  I ordered SHEILA'S GRILLED CHICKEN & AVOCADO salad.  This lunch portion can be split in two, salad is tossed with a citrus honey vinaigrette.  Piled high are mixed greens, grilled chicken, cashews, shredded carrots, red onion, crunchy tortilla strips, cilantro and of course AVOCADO!  No need to search for the chicken, every stab of the fork you come up with piece of chicken.  Remember, this is ONLY the lunch portion, the dinner size might feed an entire table of 4, ijs.  The salad was DRESSED not soggy, still had crisp to the lettuce and crunch to the cashews.  for dessert: SALTED CARAMEL CHEESECAKE Um, yea...I kind of was disappointed with this selection, for me personally the graham cracker crust was too thick, the base was basic, what made it salted caramel was that a layer of caramel sits atop of the cheesecake.  Yea, that's all I have to say about that  Of course the cheesecake does not effect the star rating, I will just try a different cheesecake, they have over 20 different flavors.  But this is just my opinion , go try it out you might go giddy over the salted caramel cheesecake.",

My boyfriend and I went after a lovely show at the Smith Center and it let out about 10pm. We wanted to go eat somewhere nice and conveniently close. As we love our Cheesecake Factory at Green Valley Ranch, we decided to try this location based on our great experiences with the other locations.  Great factor was that it was open till 12am but downside is that even though there were not so many people on a Friday night, the service was very slow. We usually get our favorites, Avocado Spring Rolls, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Rib Eye Steak.   The Spring rolls were delicious as is the sauce which is easily devoured! But the Bistro Shrimp pasta was really spicy! Now this is supposed to be a general garlic and wine sauce with no spicyiness at all. It had way too much red chili peppers! My mouth was on fire!   The steak was burned but my boyfriend ate it anyways since he was hungry.  When the server asked about the meals I let him know of the issues but all we got was a 'Sorry' (It wasn't his fault for the food though) and only 5% off the bill.  If you want the traditional Cheesecake Factory yumminess, don't go to this location as it lacks the quality and taste.",

However, from the first five minutes here i found the most courteous and sincere employee here was SKYLER,  the front of house manager. He is attentive, and provides excellent service with a smile and great attitude. He goes above and beyond to ensure that your experience is of the highest caliber and provides way more service than some of the most high end restaurants. Overall the atmosphere was a pleasure and it was mostly so because of his service. I definitely recommend this particular cheesecake to any one that appreciates good service!",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong... who doesn't love The Cheesecake Factory? This review is specifically aimed for this location.  This was my first time to this property. I came tonight for a birthday party. Now I understand large groups can be challenging but with that being said there were still some awkward moments. I arrived and when I asked for my party the girl at the front just gave me half ass directions. She told me to go through the double doors. The only double doors I saw looked like an exit outside so I just kind of roamed around aimlessly until I was able to stop and ask another employee where to go. So those double doors that led out were correct. So they have doors that go outside first and then there is another set of doors leading to a separate room. But come on.... I know I couldn't have been the first person to be confused by the layout. It wouldn't have killed her to give a little more detail. Our server was nice and personable. I ordered the Louisiana pasta. Tasty but not really memorable. The lady next to me ordered the salmon which she said was fantastic. Two people on opposite ends of the table ordered the shrimp angel hair pasta and they both said the shrimp was WAY over cooked, rubbery and a lot of shell. See no one really checked on how the meal was until we were all almost done. Since it was a birthday my friend was trying to be discreet and let the server know about the dissatisfaction with the shrimp on two dishes. His response was that she should have let him no sooner. And yes... she should have. But no one came by to check. So was she supposed to interrupt dinner to find someone. Again, it was a birthday party and she didn't want to make a scene. Then the check came without offering anyone dessert. Yes.... dessert came for the birthday girl. So that should have been a great time to ask anyone if they would like to finish it off with something sweet. When my check was handed to me I asked for a piece to go and was told I would have to have two separate checks. Ok fine. I guess it's somehow my fault I wasn't offered dessert before the check. 2 bills then. Whatever. Just bring me my cheesecake please....",

We waited 45 minutes for our food while we \"enjoyed\"our burnt appetizers, our waitress was no where to be found to tell her that we would like them remade. We didn't get to eat together the plates were brought out 10 minutes apart and 2 of the dishes were wrong we didn't have time to have the dishes remade because we had a child with us and the manager still charged us for the disappointing food and terrible service I expected more from this location.",

Taking the chance to enjoy calamari , dynamite shrimp, crab artichoke dip, fried crab balls?, and one more item i can't quite remember. Everything was delicious for the most part ... oh yea stuffed mushrooms that came out cold... but dont worry they took them back and warmed them up before bringing them back for us to enjoy.Another issue i did have was noticing a couple with a kid who came in afterward, but receiving their drinks before we did ... but i took it out of his tip and made a  note of it , of course !!!",

I got there and they told me there were no reservations under my name for that night. The lady at the front tried to give me a hard time.

    "text": "it was an extremely long wit for a seat here at lunch (it always is) but their food is large portioned, decently priced and classic american fare. My friends LOVE their pasta and were happy with their creamy choices while my chicken tacos were good, but not amazing. The avocado was brown and the shells broke with the amount of salsa they put at the BOTTOM of the tacos...  Service was also extremely slow and we were hardly attended to but the tiramisu cheesecake is probably my new favourite! Not too heavy, plenty of cake and coffee flavour too!",

The bartender was helpful picking between two meals I couldn't decide on.  Her description of the Chicken Madiera was so precise!  Their sourdough bread was warm and fresh.  Their passion iced tea was refreshing and didn't have any indication of mold in their dispenser!  Yay!  Trust me, it happens.  My food came in about 10min from when I ordered and was delish!!  The bartender checked on me a few times... just enough... not too much as to be annoying.  Bathrooms were clean and well enough away from the eating area.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch and sat at a table in the bar area. Our server came over and took our drink orders rather promptly.   The menu is huge, so it took us a few minutes. And it doesn't have photos anymore so I was looking on my phone to get a better idea of what I was going to eat.  I ordered a lunch portion of the chicken, mango and avocado salad without wonton and skinny pomegranate dressing on the side. JD ordered the sandwich, soup and salad lunch combo.  My salad arrived and looked so sad. The chicken beast it's self was flat. It wasn't plump and juicy. It looked like it had been sitting in a freezer with a 100 lb weight on it. See photos. There was hardly any avocado- maybe 1/4 of one. No almonds to be found. The fruit was definitely not fresh. I was able to squish it so easily with a fork. It had been sitting in a can. You can always tell the difference between fresh, frozen and canned fruit. Nice try with trying to pull a fast one though.  When we told our server what was wrong, she made me feel that this was somehow my fault- as did the manager. I'm sorry I didn't want crispy wontons on my salad and that I subbed dressings. It felt like that was what started this whole issue.   They comped the salad, we canceled the cheesecake slice we were going to share at the end of our meal because giving them more money after the way we were treated simply wasn't an option.   It's unfortunate that this is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in about 6 years and that it went so poorly. Definitely reminds me why I generally stray away from chains like this. Maybe the one at Caesars is still better....",

My wife and I split a chicken piccata with angel hair pasta.   The dinner portion was enough to feed us both.  The lemony sauce mixed with the capers brought a nice zest to the buttery noodles and the tender chicken  provided our delicious protein requirements.  This is our go-to dish for Italian and it's done pretty well here.  The side of little crab cake bites and ahi tuna tartare we also ordered were fairly good as well.  As was the marinara bow-tie pasta my daughter ordered.  Dessert was great.  One giant Fresh Strawberry cheesecake to feed two adults and two small kids.    Service was fairly prompt, only slow once when awaiting for our check.   Prices were reasonable and by far this is one of the better options for dinner around the outlet mall.",

    "text": "This is an ultimate failure for a cheesecake factory.  When we arrive we didn't have to wait long, so that was pleasant.  Once they called my name to seat us knowing full well we have a small child and need a menu for him they didn't bring one.   They station us in a back area from the main dinning area. I didn't care so much about that, we did have to walk outside to go back inside to be seated.   Once we are seated and given our menus I realize we didn't get a kids menu and I asked for one.  The hostess never brought us one so we ended up having to ask the waitress what was available for children. This was after we had already sat at the table 15 minutes before we were even greeted by our waitress; who was overwhelmed.     We figure out what my son wants, we order drinks and food. We are asked if we want bread and we say yes. Then our waitress was off, we order water, sprite and a mojito.  We get our water and sprite about five minutes later and about fifteen minutes after that they bring my food and my husbands. I set timer and they bring my sons plate out, over five minutes later.    When I was done with my meal they finally bring my mojito (mind you, after I ordered it I said I'd walk back over and get it because it is pretty far from our seating area). They never did bring us bread and we never did see out waitress again because someone else brought our meals and drinks.   After we were done eating it took another fifteen minutes to get our check.   This was the most awful experience ever.  Poor time management and multitasking.  I think the manager needs some updated training.  He/she is way over their heads.   Our food wasn't bad.",

So, finding out that they had opened a Cheesecake Factory near my job had me hyped up.  This location is by far has the worst service I have ever gotten in my life!! I usually just order pick up now a days since the servers abandon you and give you very poor service. Even the food sometimes makes me sick. I'm sorry, but I'm am very unsatisfied with this location.",

We both agreeded the burger was TOPS! The salad lacked color, just a big bowl of green. Our other party had a philly sandwich. STEAK KNIVES NEEDED.  The bread  was hard to cut. Over all it was FANTASTIC! Going back for dinner one day!",

    "text": "Some of my office mates and I came to Cheesecake Factory last week for one of their birthdays.  I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before so I looked at the online menu before we even left.  I wanted to have at least some kind of idea going in.  It did not take me long to choose the Renee Special lunch with a Ceasar Salad, chicken almond salad sandwich and the soup of the day, cream of mushroom.  I was very happy with all of it.  From quality to quantity, it was all enjoyable.  The salad, while a good Ceasar, was nothing special.  Just a salad done right.  The soup was crazy good.  I love mushrooms and mushroom soup. This was an interesting varient that was a littl less creamy than I am used to but loaded with mushrooms, carrots and some other bits of deliciousness.  The sandwich was abotu as good as the soup.  Even though it was chicken salad.  This wasn't the soggy mash of chicken salad your mama used to send you to school with. This was solid chunks of chicken with a bit of mayo and almonds.  It was very good and I would gladly order it again.  My one regret is not ordering a piece of cheesecake.  I love cheesecake and I was at the Cheesecake Factory.  How could I be so careless as to not order cheesecake?  I just have to shrug that off right now and go back again later.  I'll get my cheescake.  Beileve me I will.",

Of course when the tip was received, the service got OFF THE CHARTS AMAZING while we were leaving.  I usually go to the Summerlin location, but after a day at the outlet with friends,and not knowing there was a cheesecake there, we tried it out. I PERSONALLY won't be going back for the simple fact that there were flies above our table. When we expressed it to our server, he \"justified\" the flies as being \"bar flies\"... Can you say, still grossed the f**% out?  Didn't offer to move us or anything.(there were 6 of us)  I understand the fruits and sugars and such attract buggies  but I work in the industry as well and we do not have that issue...( btw there were no flies or gnats by the bar) Just saying.",

    "text": "I have to agree with everyone else who has had issues with this particular Cheesecake Factory. I'm a huge fan of the chain and was excited when a location opened close to my work downtown. At this point, though, I can say my co-workers and I will probably never return to this one again.  We were a party of 8 and arrived early, so we beat the entire lunch crowd in terms of getting seated and getting our orders in. When we ordered, I asked the waitress for bread and butter. 10 minutes later, we were all sitting around, still waiting for our bread and butter.  45 minutes after we had ordered, our food was still nowhere to be seen. When the food did begin to come out, it came in waves. Eventually, all but one of us had gotten our food. This was bizzarre because three people at the table had ordered salmon. Two got their salmon, the third was left waiting. It was a solid 7 minutes that we all sat around staring at our food as it grew cold while we waited for the final person to get her meal so we could all start eating.   The manager did come and appologize for this, and gave her a comped dessert, so that was nice. Another person's salmon ended up being completely burned on the bottom, so that had to go back and the manager her a comped dessert as well.   We were there for a celebreation, so when it came time to order dessert, several of us ordered cheesecake. I ordered a slice of the Banana Creme Cheesecake. They brought our cheesecakes, and I took one bite of mine and it was FROZEN. At that point, I was so over it I didn't even want to mention it to the waitress, but the rest of my party was fed up and told her as soon as she came over again. She made a face and informed us that the Cheesecakes are all freshly made.  I poked the cheesecake with my fork to demonstrate and it made the classic \"crunch\" sound of a frozen cake, so she took away my cheesecake and was gone for another 10 minutes (this was the trend of the whole meal). When she returned, she asked if I'd like to have strawberry cheesecake instead. I said no thank you, can I please just have another slice of the banana creme? She then informed me that the banana creme was all frozen. So I ended up with no cheesecake.  And all would have been well if that had been the end of it. I'd have left sad and disappointed, but not angry. No, the anger came when I got the bill and saw that my frozen, inedible, cheesecake that I had been forced to cancel was charged on the bill, and then marked as a \"comp.\" Being forced to take back food because it is frozen is not a \"comp, \" that is bad customer service. It is insulting to your customers when you mark food as a \"comp\" when in fact they received nothing. I had one bite of frozen cake and was forced to send it back. You have not done me any favors by not charging me for that cake. That cake should never have been given to me in the first place.   Overall, the main dishes we did receive were the usual yummy quality of Cheesecake Factory. But getting our bread took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our desserts took forever, and getting our bill took forever. There is a serious managment issue going on with this location that needs to be fixed ASAP.",

Due to the fact that she messed up my order and the wait time was to long that my hunger went away (what a waste of money)   I ordered a kids Mac and Cheese,Deluxe Cheeseburger Sliders with bacon,and fried mac and cheese balls.  1/2 My order came  - my burgers had no cheese and bacon, the wait time was 15mins,and the waitress said sorry we couldn't figure how to add it into the system with out charging it (but i was charged anyways)  and my sons mac and cheese had no flavor, and i had to add salt.   And my fried Mac and cheese balls never came out, i had to finally ask the waitress  and she didnt even write it down.  I was pissed! So the wait time for that was another 15 mins.   My meal was ruined and when your dining with Toddlers, time is of the essence!  But what pissed me off is nothing was comp for my messed up order and the wait time.  This will be my last time dining at cheesecake factory.",

    "text": "Cheesecake Factory at the outlets downtown! What's not to like? I'll list what there IS to like first.  1) Giant covered patio with fans so you enjoy the outdoor feel, but are insulated from outlet traffic and direct sunlight. 2) Very willing and able to split checks. I went with 7 friends and our waiter offered to split the check for us; we didn't even have to ask. 3) Someone constantly checking on you. If my water glass hit 75% full, it was promptly filled back up. We were also asked at least twice if our food was all cooked to our liking. 4) Those bread baskets. If you haven't been to Cheesecake Factory and are opposed to chain restaurants, at least go enjoy a complimentary bread basket and a latte.  5) The food is delicious and amazing and they hit every price range. You can spend $50 on yourself for dinner, or $10 and still leave satisfied and happy.  6) Contrary to what most people would think, this is a great restaurant to go to if you're gluten-free or gluten intolerant. They mark menu items with a GF option so you can have a ton of items modified to be gluten-free (pasta, flat breads, sandwiches, salads, etc.).  The only negative I can think of is the fact that this restaurant is crowded. I wouldn't recommend it for an intimate occasion. The customer to server ratio has got to be 5:1. I've never seen so many servers in one place. It's good because you get a ton of attention, but can be annoying when you're trying to walk to your table and walk to the bathroom and have to wait for a lot of people to pass.",

Being the chatty gal that I am, our server informed me that it had only been open for a week so I decided to give them a hall pass. We had 2 servers for a party of 11... is that really necessary?   Getting our drinks took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our separate checks took an eternity. What was supposed to be a quick work lunch break turned into a 2 hour meal. 3 of us ordered the same appetizer, mine came out first, then 10 mines later the second one came out with a noticeable smaller portion. I immediately notified I server (My side of the table had the competent server) and he directed the manager to come see us. The manager said he would give us another order gratis. When all the entrees came out, the 3rd appetizer came out. By the end they tried charging us for 4 appetizers. It was really just one thing after the other. And I get it, it was their first week open but it seemed like their staff had no industry experience. By the time we were heading out it was packed. I know this place is destined to do well because the Premium Outlets lack decent dining. Hopefully the staff gets better.",

This is Las Vegas and a bar. People walk up to the bar at every other place I've been all the time. Also, seating was available but we had to wait. Spoke to the manager and he was rude and didn't care. There were 25 people having food and drinks. You'd think they would be happy for the business. I will say most servers were nice, food was good, and we made the most of the seating issue and the bad attitude of that bartender and rude manager. But my future group events we will go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Im not sure why the rating is so low, but this cheesecake factory is top notch. It is located out on the fashion outlet shops off the 15 freeway, North, Charleston B. It is a high end restaurant that serves great quality food with excellent service, expect to be thrilled if you have never been here.   Outside, there are plenty of surrounding shops for people to shop for clothes, accessories and other various products. The location is located near a corner street. You cant miss it.   Inside, it is noisy during peak hours at about 3-6pm on a weekend. There are bathrooms located in the back and no free wifi. The decoration is like any other cheesecake factory: a yellow tinted wall with various ceiling lights. There is a cheesecake bar for people to order cheesecake at the entrance. There is a bar for alcoholic drinks as well. There are many booths and regular tables/chairs scattered all over. I have been here in the afternoon and at night. It is the same noisy environment.   Service: very good. Me and my family member were seated in less than 3 minutes. Our server was great, fast and efficient. He had a good personality and gave us our drinks before 3 minutes. Our meal came in about 10-15 minutes with a busy crowd. The bread they give you for convenience is warm. There are two types: sourdough and a whole grain bread.    The prices: pretty moderate. Most of the entrees on the menu are above $10 and can go up to around $50 for their more expensive specialty items. I personally enjoyed the chicken madeira. It is their most popular chicken dish. However, I order other items on their skinnylicious menu. It is worth a look if you are wanting to cut pounds.    Overall, it is a good experience. The food is worth what you pay for. The environment can be noisy, service is on point and the cheesecake selections are outstanding. Great for dates, family gatherings and hangouts with friends, but don't expect anything to be on the cheap end.",

I ordered the cheesesteak sandwich that was so so. It reminded me of pressed meat and really didn't have much flavor. Unfortuanately the roll was pretty hard.

    "text": "We started our day at the North Las Vegas Premium Outlet and I saved my stomach just for this. We arrived around 12:48 PM and we were led to a table right away. It wasn't extremely busy but most tables were occupied. I ordered a hot cafe mocha, spicy chicken chipotle pasta (lunch special), and a white chocolate raspberry truffle. We were also served with complimentary breadsticks. They were warm and were great to munch on before our meal.   The cafe mocha was large but nothing too spectacular regarding the flavour. It was a standard mocha. The spicy chicken chipotle pasta smelled delicious when it arrived. I also added some Parmesan cheese on top. The crispy tortilla chips added an extra crunch to the dish and I enjoyed it. The spicy chicken was flavourful, and had a nice kick. There were also pieces of asparagus and green peas to add a little green to the dish. However, I thought the pasta itself were too firm, it would have been better if they were softer.   I took a long time to decide which cheesecake to get because they just had so many! After much contemplation, I settled for the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. It was a big slice with whipped cream on top and on the side. It was truly delightful, it wasn't too sweet which I liked. At first I was worried that it would be too sweet but not at all. The cheesecake itself was smooth and creamy, with a great balance between the white chocolate and raspberry. I cannot wait to try their other cheesecake next time I'm in the States.  Service was great, the server dropped by to check up on us and made sure everything was good. Food arrived in a timely manner. I asked for a to-go cup for my mocha and I received one promptly. Overall, I had a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory.",

Our server was nice, we didn't see her too much of the evening but we didn't need much. The food took at least 30-45 minutes to arrive. She forgot to put our appetizer in, so once we got our meals they comped our appetizer and brought it late; which we ended up splitting it to-go. The food was good, of course. I think the prices are way too high for what this place offers, obviously not the location's fault but the brand itself.

As for food I had the guacamole salad with grilled shrimp added. The portion size was huge and the overall flavor was delicious. I'd come back here again just for this salad.  Another typical chain restaurant, but with good service and decent food. A great lunch or dinner option if you're shopping at the outlet mall.",

Maybe I was just in heaven because we had just seen Hamilton before going here for burgers, but I loved it! We sat at the bar and had a great meal.   The Old Fashioned Burger is charbroiled on a toasted brioche bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and mayonnaise. It's served with French Fries or Green Salad. It was perfectly cooked and juicy.   The Mushroom Burger is  charbroiled and topped with sauteed mushrooms, onions, melted Swiss, Fontina cheese and mayo. This one was overcooked (ordered Rare - got Med.) but still juicy and yummy.   We finished with an outstanding Lemoncello Cream Torte which had layers of  vanilla cake and lemon mascarpone cream topped with streusel and served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Wow!   4 Stars for ambiance and quality. Plus, the prices were reasonable and the service was great!",

We checked in at the front desk and the lady said the wait time will be 5-10 mins and got seated at 8 mins. Kinda nice knowing we were seated within the allotted time because we know TCF gets extremely busy.  We started off with  \"Warm Crab And Artichoke Dip\" due to \"Fire Roasted Fresh Artichoke\" not being available which is kinda disappointing, we really wanted to try it and \"Stuffed Mushrooms\" which is really good, kinda sad they only serve a small portion of it because it's my favorite.   For entree, our party ordered the \"Pasta Da Vinci\" \"Fresh Grilled Salmon\" \"Herb Crusted Fillet Of Salmon\". What I like about TCF over the larger restaurant chains the food never lets you down. The food portions are always large to share with others.   Leave some room for desserts though. As we didn't so we ordered for takeout. No matter what you are craving when it comes to cheesecakes you will not go wrong. I recommend the red velvet and the salted caramel. Oh boy what a surprise because I thought nothing could top the Red Velvet.  The customer service was super slow, our server hardly dropped by to fill up our water. But I sorta understand seeing how busy the place was. So we didn't think too much of it.",

Then we waited what we thought was 15 minutes but turns out by our check in time per the managers (Skylar) words \"23 minutes\" for a waiter to come and acknowledge us. (The couple behind us noticed my boyfriend talked to the manager and confirmed that they also waited a very long time to get acknowledged) We ordered 2 drinks, mine came out but my boyfriends did not. It must have gotten lost because he was parched without a drink for about 10 more minutes until we made our waitress aware of the \"mistake.\" After all that we spent an hour and 10 minutes for 2 drinks and one shared meal. I will never recommend or spend my money at Cheesecake Factory again.   P.S. We live closer to the Summerlin location but weeks ago they served us undercooked food so we decided to try this location instead. Our mistake, because they still failed at decent service.",

First off, I have to say our waiter was the nicest, but he was very very slow. I'm not sure if he was new, but if that's the case then he gets a pass.   He came around 2-3 times asking what our drinks were. About 20 minutes later he came back and asked for our orders. Once our orders were taken, it wouldn't be until another hour until we received our orders. And for me and my boyfriend, another HALF HOUR-45 minutes until we got our orange chicken and chipotle pasta. In total, our party got their food within an hour and we got our order about an hour and a half later-two hours later. By that point, we had 3 sprites, two baskets of bread, our buffalo blasters, and we were not hungry anymore. We took our food to go because our party was already done eating.  I do have to say about 2 or 3 managers came out apologizing saying our orders are coming out hot and fresh. Yes, I accept your apologies, but it doesn't change the fact that you guys didn't even take at least the appetizer off the bill and we still paid full price. My boyfriend and I waited 2 hours just to take our food to go. I'm extremely disappointed in Cheesecake, specifically this location.",

I called 30 mins before my lunch to make sure my order was good to go as always, I placed an order of Fried Calamari, good to go. I went over there on my lunch to pick it up and there was nothing. No sign of my order being there. I couldn't have called the wrong location because it's the only phone number we have of them and we call it all the time. The staff and managers seem to be clueless and not even the slightest apologetic of my inconvenience. So I still paid and tried to wait for my food but still took almost 20 minutes where the at the time did not seem to be busy at all. They said that it was coming right up and I waited it was almost time for me to clock back in when I got my food to go and it looked really half assed. The amount of food I got was about half of what I would usually get and they had a soggy piece of napkin underneath the food. It was not fresh, it was not even remotely warm. I was not happy with the experience and staff did not try to do much to help out the situation.",

I am 64 years old and have traveled the world.  Her whole persona was just amazing.  I have never had a server with such class and immediate attention to service like Ashley.  You needed something she had it there before you even called her.  Just incredible .  Always smiling.  Never pressuring.  She made our eating experience one of a kind.  In a day and age when people don't care to be kind it was so refreshing to have her.  Thanks Ashley.  Hope we see you again.",

They said they were all out of cheesecake after we sat there for over an hour eating our dinner and we had ordered our cheesecake at the beginning of our meal. The waitress kept coming back and saying they were out of all of the flavors we wanted and that was 5 different flavors that we attempted to order. No apologies and then the manager basically said oh well we don't have any thing for you. Very unhappy",

I had the Chicken Madeira which is their most popular plate, ummm I wasn't a fan of it however my girlfriend had the Herb Parmesan chicken and it was sooooo good! Definitely recommend it! Lastly we had the Banana Cheesecake and that was even better, for us next time we order we might order ours with whip cream on the side, we thought it was a bit too much. At the end of the night we ended up crossing the street and realized we forgot our keys my girlfriend KINDLY asked the guy cleaning the table \"Sorry to bother you but have you seen some car keys?\" The waiter cleaning the table SIGHED and said NO I'm cleaning this table. Dude wtf! We realize this is not a fun job for you to have but it's your job to suck it up! No one decided this shitty job but yourself so don't be mad at the paying customer. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for having a lost and found policy well under control.",

I actually had to tell not one, but two managers the wait time on water. Food took way too long to come Out and 2 other tables that came in after us was served their food first.  My husband was a.manager for a few years at the San Diego. CAli Cheesecake Factory && he even said that tops should take no more than 2 mins to get drinks n bread out.  Also, nothing was compensated at the end of the night. I Don't ever expect anything for free, but normally managers would do that for customers who  Are unhappy with service or at least cover dessert.    The whole experience was terrible from the sit down to paying the bill.  Wait, wait, wait forever for anything!::  DON'T MESS WITH A 32 WEEK PREGNANT LADY && HER FOOD.   Okay, my rant is done.  Would still eat at Cheesecake because of the food, BUT NEVER AGAIN at this one at Caesars Palace .. The forum ..**Thumbs down!** in Rick James Voice!",

A little disappointed as the charbroiled beef patty is a bit dry and they don`t come with any sauce inside the burger.

They nachos were crisp and warm, topped with a generous mound of cheese and chicken and drizzled nicely with semi spicy enchilada sauce. They'retopped with pico, sour cream, and guacamole. We also choose the Parmesan Garlic Cheese bread. The bread was served warm with lots of gooey cheese in the middle on the side was a small bowl of garlic oil dipping sauce.  For our entrees we choose grilled Salmon and Spicy Louisiana chicken pasta. The salmon was grilled to a flaky perfection. It was served with mash and fresh veggies.  The pasta was almost al dente, which is not to me liking, but it was spiced and sauced just the way I prefer.  We couldn't leave without a slice of its namesake. We ordered the Oreo cheesecake. It was enough to share with a party of 3 and light, creamy, with the the right amount of cookie flavor.",

Firstly, we waited about 15 minutes for a table for two. Which made sense as it was 5pm on a Sunday right after a matinee at the Smith center had finished. The three ladies at the hostess station were rockin getting people seated in an efficient manner. Now, one is never mad when they have to wait because now you just stare and find the cheesecake of your dreams for dessert.  Once we were seated our waiter Ruben came by! He brought us our waters and could tell we weren't ready with our order just yet. We just couldn't decide what to order and instead ordered four different small bites/appetizers and got to have a little bit of everything. We had the fried zucchini, fried crab bites, roadside sliders and the potstickers. We just shared them and got to eat a bit of everything! For dessert we of course got cheesecake - I had the cookie dough cheesecake and he had the Reese's cheesecake! Of course, we did have to take half of those home because we were stuffed.",

We ordered three slices of cheesecake... big mistake. Too much food.    Lemon raspberry was not bad. Liked the mango key lime. But the favorite was key lime. Right amount of tartness.

This restaurant was no different from the other restaurants we visited except for the Waikiki location.  The reason being that the Waikiki restaurant is the Cheesecake Factory's busiest location.  This location had the great food, great service and of course, a wonderful selection of cheesecakes!  (Damn!  So much for my diet...). Stop by to visit if you're in the area!",

Regardless of which city I'm in, the Cheesecake Factory seems to always have the same level of quality and service.  Our waiter quickly brought us water and bread and always made sure that our glasses/ basket was full. My problem is that I always load up on the bread and then I'm never hungry for dinner. Oops! I shared my dish with my cousin, as their portions are extremely large. I forgot the name of the dish I ordered, but it was the pasta with mushrooms and chicken. I ended up swapping out the penne noodles of linguine to make it more personal.   After dinner we sat and talked for 30-ish minutes. It was nice to not be rushed out!   After a day at the outlets, I would recommend stopping by.",

    "text": "To be honest I've tried The Cheesecake Factory a few times many years ago. I'm not sure why it's flown past my radar for this long. Probably because it was rather unremarkable. Well after another day at the Premium Outlets we decided to give it another try.  We ordered the Bacon-bacon cheeseburger, which as the name implies, is a bacon loaded burger stuffed with two kinds of cheeses. My wife had the Thai coconut-lime chicken (yes a a \"Thai\" dish at at American chain lol) which was actually quite good. Totally unauthentic but it seemed to work. Portions are big so plan accordingly if you came to eat the cheesecake. Most people will have a hard time eating a small appetizer, a full entree and then a cheesecake right after. We decided to opt for the to go option because we were seriously stuffed! (Red Velvet. Will report back)  If you're looking for a standard American style restaurant without comprise, Cheesecake Factory is a good option.",

    "text": "With guilty pleasures of all forms prevalent in Las Vegas, my personal guilty pleasure is food -- and the chain restaurant of the Cheesecake Factory, as I mentioned in a previous review from another Favtory location! Infamous for being one of the most ridiculously unhealthy restaurants in the States ( with many of its foods clocking in at over 2000 calories by themselves, and that's not including the cheesecakes they're famous for! ), I still enjoy it enough that it's worth the calorie binge just to indulge in cheesecake.  As I was in the area for a work-related function, I stopped into the Factory location at the Outlet Shopping Center for lunch -- which was just as well, since I managed to get seated before the lunch rush arrived! As for the food, I ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, the soup of the day, the Factory combo of chicken Madeira and steak Diane, and the mango and key lime cheesecake.  Per the usual, the Cheesecake Factory provides complementary bread for one to munch on while waiting for the food, and it is quite tasty, though I admit I didn't eat too much of the bread as I intended to save room for my order. The fried macaroni and cheese was the first to come out, and it was crisp, flavorful and indulgent! Perfectly gooey, as well -- as macaroni and cheese should be!  With regards to the soup of the day, I was told it was a chicken and vegetable soup. However, it came out with tortilla strips, so it was chicken tortilla, and then I found potatoes and rice in it, which is... not typical of tortilla soup? I will admit, I tried to like it, but I was left more confused about what kind of soup it was. It was not to my liking, to put it mildly.  The Factory combo I ordered had one of my personal favorite items on the menu -- the steak Diane -- so of course I enjoyed it immensely, but the chicken Madeira was also very good and surprisingly light despite mozzarella cheese being among the chief ingredients of the dish. I polished as much of the plate as I could, though I didn't finish the potatoes since I wanted to save enough room for dessert.  Of the numerous cheesecakes on offer, this time I went for the mango key lime cheesecake for something different and more tart than the usual. The acidity of the lime and the sweetness of the mango -- plus the surprise coconut macaroon crust really made this a spectacular and somewhat lighter option of all the cheesecakes on offer. Props to my server for recommending it!  The Cheesecake Factory is popular enough here in Vegas that it has multiple outposts in the City. However, one of the things I noticed is that it took a while for my server to get back to me with my orders -- which, while understandable during the latter part of the meal due to more diners coming in, it was noticeable early on when there wasn't that many people in the restaurant that they were really slow. That plus the miss on the soup of the day means that this location only gets three out of five stars for me. While I love to come in on my cheat days, I think I'll just stick to my personal favorite Factory location in the District...",

    "text": "Not sure what it is about The Cheesecake Factory where the service is consistently poor!   My husband and I both worked at the cheesecake (it's where we met!) for MANY years. The training was extensive and the expectations from our managers were high. If I provided service like the service we receive when we go, I would be fired.   Today was no exception. We went because we had a gift card. Even though the last few times (at other locations), the experience has been similar. Our server was slow, completely uninterested and lackadaisical. It started out semi fine, but turned into sitting and waiting for forever for everything with empty drinks. It's so weird to me to walk by a table over and over and see (or not see) that the drinks are completely empty and never think to refill. I'm allllll for tipping and tipping well, but isn't that what I'm tipping for?! To have a decent experience and be able to have a sip of water during the meal?! We looked around throughout our time there, and all of the server's tables needed their drinks filled, orders taken or food boxed up. But he was no where to be found.   We ordered the tuna poke entree. The presentation was beautiful as always. But the rice was dry (and wayyyyy too much of it), there was verryyyyyy little siracha aioli, and it was really bland over all. To give an example how bland- I shared it with my 9 month old baby. Especially for $15.95. I could get a delicious sushi burrito bowl with good quality fish and amazing toppings and fresh rice for $9 at a lot of places in Vegas now!  We also ordered the Shrimp with angel hair which was good and pasta cooked well and the crispy chicken costoletta. That was yummy too and came out with the side of sauce my husband had asked for.   We have such special memories of the Cheesecake Factory because of our history there.  We opened and worked in so many of the stores. It's such a disappointment to go and get such poor service when you know it's really not that hard and you can make good money when you provide a good experience. So we've gone back for the history. But its the service that usually makes you walk out feeling like you just wasted your money and time :(",

    "text": "Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants. When you go to a Cheesecake Factory in different cities, the food quality, menu, service, ambiance are standard. But wait, this location apparent does not adhere to the same standards. I was thinking maybe because they're at an outlet, they follow slightly sub par standards.   The food was just poorly executed and presented. We ordered calamari, Chicken Romano, Filet subbed mashed potatoes with sauteed spinach, chocolate cake, and a Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake.  They can't even slice the calamari before frying them. I had a whole squid mixed in with tentacles and rings. The noodles that came with the chicken Romano was not al dente - it was undercooked and chewy. I had to take it home and pour 1/4 cup of boiling water to bring the noodles to life. My sister got the filet and instead of mashed potatoes, she asked for sauteed spinach. She got about 8 leaves of uncooked spinach and the plating was just plain horrible. The chocolate cake and the cheesecake were good. However, they're 3/4 the size of what you'd normally get at other locations. For the same price, you get less food and poor quality.  Service was just as bad. It was slow. We were given cold bread. He never checked on us to see if we needed anything or how the food was. I asked for a box for my cheesecake. I was still digging in with a fork and server was taking my plate from me! WTH? I'm still eating and I can box my own stuff.",

A while later, our chicken sandwiches were brought out to us. I noticed that the ketchup looked solid and the ranch had a greenish color.  We were so hungry so we dug in.  The chicken was dried out. You could tell that the plate was sitting under the heat lamp while the fries were cooking. Eventually our server asked us about our food and I let her know I couldn't eat the sandwich.  She took my plate and the manager came to check on us.  They took the chicken sandwiches off the bill and offered to provide something else or a cheesecake.

This was actually my first time at this location but I kind of knew that the food was going to be great because I used to be a regular in the location in Hawaii.  What I've never had before was the Korean fried cauliflower.. are you kidding me?! That dish was amazing! The cauliflower itself was not over or under cooked, and the flavor is not over powering like how some places make it.. it was so pleasant to eat.... I ordered another one -_-...dont judge me- Their veggie burgers have always been pretty good in my opinion for as long as I have been eating them. The customer service and attention that we have received was perfect.. cheesecake factory is doing something right.",

    "text": "My sister bought a cheesecake at this location for a family birthday and my girlfriend felt a crunch and spat out a cockroach from the cheesecake. Threw up. The roach was cooked into the cake. We immediately stopped eating, knowing that we all ate a roach contaminated cake. There were 2 children who also ate it. The next day, we reached out to the Southern Nevada Health Department to do a full investigation on the property. After reaching out to a local exterminator, they confirmed that it is a roach. After contacting the management, we reached out to corporate because he mentioned that the cake was baked elsewhere and not in the property. When we went in to the restaurant with the contaminated cake and roach to hopefully receive at least a refund, he said he cannot reimburse us and he did not take responsibility for the matter, only bringing corporate's faulty. He did not offer a sincere apology, refund, or offered any suggestions, nor accept the cake. Disappointed. How would you feel if your family ate a roach inside a celebration cake?",

I asked our server nicely if he could put a candle on her cake, and he did not only put a candle on her cake, but they also turned her plate into a birthday plate, and had 5 servers sing Happy Birthday to her, which was super sweet.  We had the salty caramel cheesecake and chocolate mousse cheesecake. They were delicious! (The only bad thing about them is that it's just too much cake, cause let's face it - nobody needs 900 calories worth of cheesecake.) ;) We ate about half of it, and our server put the rest in boxes for us so we could bring it home.   All in all we had a really good birthday celebration, and looooved those cheesecakes!",

Got one down the street so i know I can make a to go order and come and pick something good to enjoy at my house.1/2 of my pasta was cooked the other half was under cooked.  Shrimp tasted not cooked all the way. And I have always been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. But idk I am just saying. How do you have a huge Resturant and you only have two small tiny stalls in the bathrooms.  Really???? I think bathrooms need to be upgraded.  Our waitress was helpful when I went to tell her about my meal so she told the manager and he is suppose to come over and talk to me about. The manager was awesome and comped my meal. Wanted to give me another one. But I am full and am not wanting to eat anything else for the rest of the day.",

I've gone there three times not wanting to not like them. Located in the Outlet Mall near downtown Las Vegas the newest CF in Las Vegas. Everything I tried this last time was too little or too much. The beet and goat cheese salad. Beets were over cooked and smushy. I've never had smushy beets. They were also too salty. Too few pieces of pecans and goat cheese. The dressing had too much vinegar and too little oil. I ordered the steak medallion instead of the steak Diane off the skinnylicious menu. The serving was too small and again too too much salt. I was done after two bites. I tried my daughters buffalo chicken appetizer. Again too salty. She had a side of the buffalo sauce. Guess what too salty. My strawberry lemonade that I always get several refills was too sweet. I don't know what's going on with this location but I am not in too much a rush to go back. I hope they get it together because I love the chain and it is usually a good choice when I travel.    UPDATE! I recently tried this location again. The dishes I ordered taste like what I expect from all CF. 5th time was the charm.",

Another 15 mins go by i still have not got my food. I then called back saying I have not got my food the lady who answered the phone said no one had told her I was here and that she would bring my food right out. I got my food around 1:15pm waited about 45 mins just hearing different answers basically just to eventually been told no one knew i was here even after I had called multiple times!!!

I don't think the waiter was trained enough to take care of the entire patio section by himself.   Food was mediocre as well. Jambalaya was extremely dry and the salad was dumped in dressing. I've definitely had better at other Cheesecake locations. I was swamped after hours of walking and shopping but then this experience just made it worse...",

I ordered, got my tea and bread, ran to the restroom, came back to the bus boy perusing my outlet mall shopping bag, after clearing my table.  He (max) realizes his mistake and gets a different waiter to correct things.  This I can deal with.  I get my salad... Then eventually some silverware... And a tea... And then some bread... And then my salad is missing the pecans and is drizzled with 2 unfortunate bites of goat cheese.  I politely ask for the salad to be tossed with some pecans.  But alas it returns with just a few pecans (wouldn't you think to toss in like a solid partial handful or something) and still no goat cheese.  Did the chef just look at it when it returned and say -- \"that looks like shit.. Let's serve it again like that.\"  The waitress and manager were the saving grace of this whole operation (and the reason for 3 stars).  They were extremely polite and empathetic, but I will not be coming back to this location just out of the shear complacence in the food preparation.  I hate being that guy, but when your order doesn't get fixed after you send it back, something must be said.    Sincerely, Unsatisfied customer: Jeff",

It was taken by a server, never heard an apology or if they were going to make another dish. As well as I didn't even get to explain what happened. Long after the rest of my party ate, a manager (I assume since she wasn't in a uniform) brought out my food and placed it on the table as quickly as she could and left without saying anything. Six out of the seven people at our table needed refills and didn't receive it until we flagged down our server. Then at the end of the meal, the bill came out where they \"comped\" the first ruined entree with a hair in it and charged me for the one they made after. I'm not one to try to get a free meal but with poor service there was no reason to even charge me for something that had a hair in it, no attempt at finding out what happened, I didn't even asked for it to be made again, and no apology. We asked for a manager since nothing was being addressed at all and they just comped it without even coming to the table and again no one apologized.",

I'd never been to this one, but it is closer to home, so decided to take the family here for dinner.   Parking wasn't too bad. We parked in the Parking Garage B right off Bonneville. Took us maybe 5-8 minutes to find parking and we walked across the street from the parking garage to the restaurant. The restaurant has valet too so if you prefer not to deal with the parking, I highly advise. The front entrance to the restaurant is off of the street side across from the garage. You can also enter from another door that is deeper inside the mall, but then you have to walk through the dining room to get to the hostess area at the front.   For appetizers, the family and I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls (delicious) and an assortment of varied spring rolls which were also very good.    I ordered Evelyn's Famous Pasta. As to be expected, the portion size was huge! Everything in the dish tasted fresh and not overly cooked. The broccoli had a bit of crispness left to it and the mushrooms weren't soggy! It was very good.   Hubby had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and even he said he was surprised how great it was!   The wait time wasn't too bad for our food. Noise level is normally pretty high overall and that is to be expected too. The dinner here was a pleasant surprise overall. I hope it continues to be so!",

We checked in and waited a few minutes to have our table ready.  Kelsey a female server greeted us with water and mentioned she was assisting Mike the server who is taking care of our party.  Mike greeted us a few minutes after bread was served to take drink and appetizer orders.  We also got the kids food started while the adults needed a few more minutes to look over the menu.  Drinks were delivered promptly and appetizers were great but we're missing one child's meal (sliders).  There were no check back on appetizers so I mentioned the missing kids meal to MOD Dawn to cancel the order.  Our server took the adults food orders and staging was preset.  During food delivery there were a 2 ribeye steak entrees  overcooked as it was ordered medium rare and arrived as medium well.  MIKE took steaks away and fired new steaks.  Nick the other MOD came over and communicated the situation.  The new rib eyes were also delivered by nick and ensured to our liking.   Kelsey and Mike were doing great table touches, refills, and pre bussing our table.  We ordered a dessert for mom and the crew came to sing to her. Kelsey assisted to close out our check.  Dawn did a final check back on our party and gave me a business card.  I thank the staff for doing a great job on taking care of our party.   Will see you soon",

The one star was only for the food b/c I really enjoy most Cheesecake Factory locations and I can't post without at least one star..The additional \" inside\" seating area that has large opening around the front of the restaurant seems to be suffering from this problem the most. Small insects in the salt shakers with flies tasting your food. As for tonight when I clearly stated I didn't want to sit in that area I was directed to the outside/Inside area again.. I was told I would be put at the end of the seating list and would have a long wait if I refused the table, even with my complaint of my last visit the young hostess continued to seat us in the area stating it wasn't outdoors. To sum it all up I ended up being seated directly against the opening to  the outside with bugs crawling on the back seat cushions and spiders on the sides while my food was being served..! Needless to say I don't think I'll be back to this location anytime soon.",

The area is more private, less busy, not as noisy, more windows, & the lighting was brighter. It was great to be seated there, but we were also forgotten by our server. After ordering our meals, she didn't come back to check up on us & we had to call another server to get her attention a couple times (or even requested for items from a different server since that seemed quicker).

My personal favorite is the Hibachi Steak and I have many favorites for cheesecake, especially the Oreo cheesecake.

    "text": "We've been to this CF twice already,  both times for Sunday Brunch. If you read the rest of the reviews here, lots of people have issues regarding service. I get that this is a new location and it takes time to work out the kinks, but people just gotta take a chill pill!!!  Our first visit, we split the Chicken Chilaquiles and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, both were excellent,and the food came out in a timely matter. Our server couldn't answer a few questions about a few of the menu items we had, but no big deal..everything else was good.  This recent visit over EDC weekend, once again, we went for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and this time we ordered the Chorizo Chicken Hash with Poached Eggs. We noticed however that our waitress seemed preoccupied and didn't seem happy. We had a few questions about things and  got short answers. We knew something was up. Now at this point, people  would dock a star or two regarding service,  but upon returning, Wifey asked politely \"Having a rough day?\"  Our waitress stepped back with a big sigh and apologized explaining the start of her day with a huge  power outage, EDC traffic, getting the kids ready, and getting ready for work all at the same time, so finding this out, we kinda sympathized with her and assured her that the worst part of her day was over, and whaddayouknow? Her demeanor did a 180...some people just need some positive reinforcement ya know?  Drinks were refilled, checked up on us periodically, and even the manager came by and was apologetic when she saw our food hadn't arrived yet!? We didn't feel  like it was a long wait, probably because I was engaged in conversation with my hot date across me...; )  When our food did arrive, the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were bomb as always, and The Chorizo Chicken Hash was perfection. From the perfectly oozing poached egg (lots of places have a hard time doing this) to the extra crispy hash I requested, no complaints here! Call me loco, but I prefer the  Cheesecake Factory over some of the other breakfast /brunch spots in town! ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter: \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  4",

    "text": "I've never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel like their food is mediocre and overpriced. That being said, this newly opened restaurant at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is a welcome addition. Dining options at the outlets have always been severely limited and kind of atrocious. It's nice to have a sit-down option instead of eating at the food court.   PRO TIP: Make sure to enter through the front entrance near the street, otherwise you'll walk in on the side like we did and be confused as to where the hostess stand is located.   COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Served with softened butter that spread easily on the bread. Love when that happens. 4/5  FRIED ZUCCHINI ($4.95): Served with a side of ranch. Came with maybe 8 pieces of zucchini. Delicious. 4/5  LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA ($16.95): Our waiter said this dish was very popular. My husband and I split this dish and ordered the chicken on the side. More than enough food for two people! I don't understand how they serve this huge bowl of pasta to one individual. Unfortunately, the dish wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and could have used a bigger helping of veggies. 2/5   SERVICE: Waiter was great. He was super cool about accommodating a picky vegetarian eater (me). Hostess was super friendly and we were sat at a booth on a Monday night with no wait time. 4/5    VIBE: Modern cafe with a tan and brown color palette. Very family friendly. 3/5   GOOD TO KNOW: If you fill out the feedback survey on your receipt, you get a $10 e-gift card good on your next visit. :)  Worth a Return Visit? Subtotal was about $27 for one entree and one small appetizer. Prices add up quickly here. We ate here because we were starving and didn't have a lot of dining options available to us. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, only as a last resort kind of thing.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #227",

That should have been our lunch.  The appetizer shared by two was delicious and there was a lot of it.  We had expected the hot jalapeno peppers to be on the side but they weren't.  We had to dig them out.  The lunch caesar's salad was delicious but also huge.  The air conditioner kept it very cold .. probably perfect for workers but not for guests.    Server was okay, not great.  We had to remind her about items a couple times.",

They also have many lunch specials available here but they definitely aren't cheap. We got the lunch size bistro shrimp pasta and the Asian lettuce tacos, which were both delicious. They also have a skinny menu with lower calorie dishes available. Most of their cheesecakes are amazing and large enough to share, just depends what flavor you're in the mood for. Service was a bit slow since we went during lunch time, so I wouldn't recommend coming if you were in a rush.",

I had the new salted caramel cheesecake which is quite delightful! It has a blonde brownie bottom and I love cheesecake that is a combo even more!

We received the best service hands down from Robbie, The guy with the  man bun, blue glasses and big ol beard. At first he came by our table handed us some waters and bread and walked away and didn't say anything. We were like oh no, here we go again. Then he came back and offered to get us some drinks and such. Honestly, he's not your typical server, but it's what made us like him so much. He's not super bubbly and chatty and fake like half of the servers you get. He seems very genuine and thats what made us like him so much. Definitely will be back.   Robbie is awesome!!!   ***  This was literally my first bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory EVER! Normally me and my fiance come and have a great experience, great food, and overall great service. This time we didn't get to experience any of that.   This was our first time at this particular location. But since we come here so often, we already know what we want to eat. And this time we were on a slight time crunch, wanted to be in and out in an hour. We got sat on the patio, on a Wednesday afternoon. It was a pretty slow section. There were only 3 or 4 tables. So when the server first greeted us, we immediately ordered our food when we ordered our drinks. That was at 2:30, so 15 minutes goes by and our server accidentally takes a fall and hurts herself, breaking glasses and such. She went to the back to get iced up I believe. With all the servers they had all day, you'd think they'd get someone to cover her section. But all we really got was a walk by from a manager asking if we were ok. 35 minutes goes by. And we still don't have our food. Our waitress was back out on the floor.   At that point I just wanted to walk out, but we did order drinks and still had to pay for them. And my fiance was starving, so we asked to get our food Togo. 45 minutes later, we get our food Togo. I asked to get our delicious strawberry lemonade Togo, and they gave us a tiny kids cup filled with ice to go with our meal.  As we walked out, I told the manager that stopped by our table earlier that our service was terrible, and all he had to say was that he was unaware of it. We understand our server did get hurt but that doesn't make up for the terrible service. Especially since there's 20+ servers working on the floor at the time. We don't eat at Cheesecake to eat takeout, we choose to eat at Cheesecake for the experience, and this Cheesecake Factory restaurant completely failed us.",

A full sun, morning in July with a temperature of 108F already, can leave a shopping clan of adults and children weary, parched and irritable.   Upon our entry, the service was cheerful, immediate, and helpful. Our table service from James was hospitable and accurate. The Kids' Menu was varied. The proportions were generous. My son opted for grilled salmon, sauteed carrots and French Fries. My daughter's plate had crispy, moist chicken tenders fresh fruit and also French Fries. The chicken was surprisingly lightly battered rather than a dense mass.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for a family friendly day in Las Vegas. A 5 star day for me is a menu with lots of organic options.",

Anyway, when this location opened up in the North Premium Outlets, I thought, \"this is going to be dangerous.\" I literally work about 300 ft. away, so I knew that I was going to have to practice self-control. I've placed my lunch order for pick-up here a few times now and it's been nothing but awesome.  Every time I call, the ladies on the other line are friendly. At the pick-up counter with all the chaos of other orders, the cashiers are fast and friendly. I haven't had any of my orders screwed up, so kudos to them, especially with my lunch being timed.  As for the food, everyone knows their menu is vast. If you're eating healthy or don't give a crap about heart disease, they have something for everyone. They can even alter some items to be gluten free. Portions are huge, so you can always split your meal into 2 servings. And of course, who can forget their infamous delicious cheesecakes? Oreo, lemon merengue, vanilla bean, plain, etc. The list goes on for about a page and a half on the menu. Hence, where the self-control comes into play.   I'm a fan and I'll definitely be back when I \"forget\" to pack my lunch:)",

With that said, I had a plate full of lettuce and a tablespoon of chicken and vegetables.   I called and spoke with RAVEN, the manager on duty that night.  Raven said she wants my every experience to be great, she was very helpful and accommodating.   I will definitely will return, because of Raven.  She owned the mistake and accepted my criticism assuring me it would never happen again.  I complimented her efforts and told her my hot bread and cheesecake were perfect!",

Their \"patio\" is actually an indoor patio area- which I think is smart.  Parking is whatever the outlet mall has to offer (which may get busy on some days).  This place was a-ok.",

The portions of food were good except for my order of the seared ahi. For $20 I got a bunch of rice that was closer to hard than soft and four slivers of tuna that belonged on an appetizer platter or with a salad. I was highly disappointed in my meal, still hungry and everyone else's leftovers. My sister and son shared fettuccine alfredo with shrimp that was yummy and my cousin ordered a chicken tender dish that was probably the whole damn chicken. I was the only one that got the short end of the stick but everything else was good.",

The wheat bread that we received was very delicious and it's worth a try! The food took a bit but they offered banana slides for our toddler which was very helpful to keep his attention! Our waitress Stefani was very friendly and gave us a honest option when it came to order the food which I really appreciated! She was attentive and took great care of us! The food was flavorful and the portions are big! The cheesecakes are great too specially the caramel one! I'd definitely eat here again! The only issue I would point out but it's not worth deduction a star was that the bathrooms were out of order (family bathroom and one of the women's bathroom). However, after pointing it out they immediately tried to fix it - great service!!",

The restaurant is very comfortable and is the perfect spot to catch up with your friends, stop by when you get hungry from all the shopping, or when you are craving a piece of cheesecake. They serve anything from fish and seafood, to salads, to sandwiches, to pastas! I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta when I'm here and I've been doing that for the past several years. You can't go wrong. They also have a skinny menu if you're trying to be healthy. Cheesecakes here are also a must. Save your tummy for a slice or take one home with you!",

We ended up being there for 3 hours and it was awful. Almost got to the point of us getting up and leaving. She overcharged us for several things as well, we didn't end up correcting her because we wanted to pay the $150 bill and leave. An example is she charged us 4.90 for a kids bowl of strawberries that is 2.95. Very upset and do not recommend, much better places to go in Las Vegas don't waste your time here.",

Sometimes we just need a break from all the fast food even when we're on the go (but don't get me wrong I love me some Panda Express still).   This location is just like every other ones I've been to, which isn't a bad thing! It wouldn't be Cheesecake Factory if it wasn't big in size, portion, and in choices. Even the lunch portion size fills you right up! The taste is always on point and consistent so you never have to worry.   Their service is always great! From the moment we walked in, we were constantly handled with so much care. The only thing is that our food took 20 minutes to come out. But our server Jessica made sure to check up on us and apologized for the wait!  If you're going to be shopping off the calories, doesn't that mean this place is worth the visit?",

It was our first time at Cheesecake Factory and we were a little overwhelmed by the large menu. It took us a long time to make our selections with no advice from our server. She didn't bring us bread until we had been there an hour at least. When we ordered we waited and watched multiple tables come and go before being told by a manager that our food was being started and we should receive it soon. The kids got their food and we waited another 45 minutes before getting ours. No one got their food the way they ordered it and one of us had to wait for fries and another for rice (both key components to our meals). Our waitress was extremely rude and slow. When all was said and done we were there over 3 hours. Then later found out that she had charged the two credit cards multiple times (4x on one and 2x on the other). They had no sympathy at all when called about it. They left one of our party without funds to even eat while 2000 miles from home.  Worst restaurant experience ever!!!!!",

It was a little confusing because the entrance that's located in the shopping area of the outlets mall is at the back of the restaurant so you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the hostess stand. Honestly I never liked that because its weird. Anyways, just an opinion..so as we got to the hostess only for us to tell us its going to be 15-20 min. Odd to us because since we walked through the restaurant we saw it was completely empty so 15-20 min? Ok...  We were sat after about 10 min and we were greeted by one server who said she would give us a few minutes after taking out drink order.  A couple minutes later another server comes up and greets us and asks if we would like some bread, we say sure. The first server comes back with our drinks and starts to take our order. The second server comes back with our bread, sees the server taking our order, says to her she can do it and then......they proceed to argue about who's table it is. Uhhhh??? So needless to say that was interesting.   So moving on we place our oder, get our food and the food was pretty good. I had the ahi tuna salad which was extremely tasty and very fresh. We also ordered a burger which was huge! The food saved this experience for us.",

She asked again is that all. I said yes, do I need to pay she said no. As I started to ask for my total she ended the call in my face! So I called back to speak with the manager. I was placed on hold for 5 minutes and someone else answers the phone and asked me what she could assist me with. I asked if she was the manager, I was shocked when she replied \"is that what you're holding for?\" I said yes and she placed me back on hold a couple of minutes. Andrew, the manager answered, and I explained to him why I was upset, he also seemed to be in a rush to get me off the phone so he just gave me my total and said \"anything else I can assist you with?\" Wow.. I was in shock! What started with being a simple complaint about one person, ended with me being disappointed with four people at this location that did not handle me professionally. This tells me that it was not a problem with the girl in the bakery taking my order, it's the entire culture, that's the problem. She treated me as if my service wasn't important because with a staff like that clearly she hasn't been trained to do so. I am disgusted with this location and have absolutely no intentions of ever returning. People should feel valued when they spend money with any company considering how hard we work to make a living these days. And especially with how many other wonderful places there are here in Vegas that we can choose to dine at.",

I went in with 8 of my closest friends because it was my birthday dinner on a Saturday night of course I was expecting it to be busy since that's how it usually is on Saturday nights in any restaurant. We went in and ordered a table for 8 took about 20-25 minutes. We sat down ordered what we wanted with drinks . Took them 25 minutes to bring out the drinks. They had already brought out the bread. Didn't even offer water while we were waiting. I had ordered extra sauce with my pasta. So they brought the pasta but no sauce. They came by once to say it's coming out but it took them 30-45 mins to bring it out by that time I was done with my dry pasta. No longer needed it. The worst part is that my friends had ordered a tirumasu cake as a surprised and the manager came up and told the whole table we are just waiting on the dessert... Really!!!!!! Just ruin the surprise. Very unsatisfied with the service here!!! Never returning I rather go to Summerline or Henderson Cheesecake Factory!!!",

    "text": "Where do I begin?! My wife and I ordered 2 cheesecakes to go. The employee takes my order and prints out the receipt. My wife changes her mind on one of the slices and we politely ask if we can change it before she even sliced a cheesecake. Already the employees bad attitude began. She gave a rude look like she didn't want to do it but did anyway. I bit my tongue and shrugged it off and said thank you when we got our 2 slices for take out. We walk around the outlet mall and notice one of the slices was a lot bigger than the other.  I had always thought cheesecake slices were huge and equal portions, I guess not. My wife and I were contemplating on exchanging it for equal slices since they were the same price at $7.95. We arrive back at the cheesecake factory with only 5 to 10 minutes passing by since us leaving. I did not wan't to deal with the rude employee so I approached a manager and he had asked if everything was fine. I explained I wanted to exchange the slice for a bigger portion since they were the same price. Get our moneys worth you know... Sam the manager said once a slice leaves the place they can't exchange it but he could give a discount at 25% if we would like to purchase a bigger piece. I agreed and had already pulled my debit card and he noticed my military ID thanking me for my service. I said thank you also. At the sometime the disgruntle employee is nodding her head in disgust as if we were trying to get a free slice. I couldn't hold my tongue anymore and said this is what I had to deal with earlier. Pointed to her and told him she is rude. He said don't worry I will take care of you and you can pick a slice and we will cover it. Let me explain I did not want anything free but I called my wife over and she picked out an oreo cheesecake slice. The employee had to cut the free slice for us but was still shaking her head. This made me more furious and I started to raise my voice. During all this commotion the employee was still nodding her head the whole time I was talking to Sam. There was at least 4 separate instances she did it. Sam said he would take care of her later. He also explained he would take care of us the next time we came in. He asked if we were locals. I said yes I have been stationed at Nellis, AFB more than 11 years. I still left pissed off. I don't care about the free slice. I would have paid for better customer service. This is ridiculous for an employee to act how she did even with the manager present.",

About 10 minutes after ordering all of our food a gentleman came up to us and informed us that there was no more prime rib. Our waitress Bree soon followed after. She was unaware that there was no more prime rib. The gentleman proceeded asked my husband what other selection he would like. He hovered over him until he made a decision. At no point did the gentleman or our waitress apologize for the inconvenience. Our food was brought out at different times. Upon receiving the order that my husband chose it was quite Untasty and  had no flavor. Our waitress didn't bother to ask us how we liked their food nor did her or management do anything about the inconvenience. Although my food was brought to me hot and tastes well the lack of customer service and poor communication between the kitchen staff and waitstaff has caused this negative review. We will not be attending this location anymore because of it.",

After waiting about 10min for it to come out after we were done eating. We checked the order and it had mushrooms in it, the server said he did not hear no mushrooms, OK it happens so he had it remade which took about 15 more min. Really so it finally comes out. Did i mention that i have a 2 year old and an eight month old so patients are running thin, finally get home and my mom opens her dinner and what do you know MUSHROOMS. We called and spoke to a manager and they said sorry we will take it off your bill. Really just take that off my bill. We can have it remade for you if you would like but you will need to come and get it. But when you come please ask for Rob. Now I drove back and ask for Rob he had no idea what I was talking about with the order. AWESOME!! Retell the whole story and he is like sorry would you like a slice of cake!! Are you kidding me. I check it and finally it is right no mushrooms but interesting the sauce is a totally different color then the one we received, now I wonder Humm did they just try and pick out the mushrooms and not remake it. I'm a chef you can't fool me!! For real please and after all the bs it was not even good there was hardly any sauce on it and the pasta was so dry.",

Our party of 7 was seated immediately on a Thursday night without any wait. Its located on the north end of a new Outlet mall off Bonneville. There is a parking structure right across from the restaurant. Our server Gary P. was the best! He assisted everyone (including the kids) with a friendly and easygoing manner to order exactly what they wanted. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (veg) with chicken even though that wasn't an option on the menu. Gary came over many times to make sure our drinks were filled and brought us extra bread. Everything was cooked perfectly and the wait time for the food was not long. I also ordered the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake to go and everyone enjoyed a bite at the hotel. Best service I've ever had at any Cheesecake factory! Will definitely go again when next in Vegas.",

They don't sell a whole cake only by tray and it's too much for only two people so we went in and asked for two slices at the front bakery and a soda. Well we live in California and we were on our way home when we realized that they had given us cheesecake not cake. I called and asked for a manager and Andrew is a \"manager\" and told me he couldn't do anything about it because it had been over an hour? Uhm HELLO!!!! It's VEGAS! Whether I lived in California or not what does the time matter?! You're telling a customer they can't go back and return something they didn't ask for?! At least exchange it. The employees really do need to pay attention to what customers are asking for. This is a tourist city and your restaurant is in a tourist area!!!!!! Pay attention for what people ask for! Not everyone has the chance to eat here all the time or to be wasting money on something they don't want just because you can't pay attention and your lousy manager can't fix your mistakes! Will never come back here again. I have family in Vegas so I'm always coming down here and they said they've always had a problem with this specific facility whether it's service or food not being prepared right or cold. It's something wrong. Even though this is the closest one to their home they'd rather drive farther just to avoid this place.",

    "text": "It was surprisingly not good. Upon arrival, I went to take my daughter to the restroom, but there was only one stall available for use. The other two toilets were clogged. Ok. No big deal I guess. Get to our table the serour drink the menus are dirty; full of butter and food debris. But our server Brea is friendly and we're both restaurant managers, but we just got off so we're not doing that right now if you know what I mean. So, we order our drinks and the kids items as they are 1 and 3; its always easier to get them going. If you're a parent you understand. Once they eat, there's a small window where they are content to allow you to eat for a few minutes in peace. Well their food came out; they ate. Some time passed; they were getting antsy. Just as my husband and I are finally about to verbalize to each other the amount of time that we had waited, a man dressed in all black approached the table to regretfully inform us that they were out out an entree we'd ordered. We ordered something else. Remember that window I mentioned before? It came. And it went a long time ago. But we waited another 15 minutes. Here's where Brea fails. She sneaks up to the table and grabs our glasses and refills them ninja fast without making eye contact giving us a chance to ask about our order nor does she bother to communicate; something, anything. Op but here comes our food so forget it who cares. Oh wait, what? Taquitos and what? Oh, no wrong table. Sorry, that's not us but hey now let me just go ahead and speak to your manager. So, another 5 minutes goes by and now we just want any employee to come by so we can get the check for our drinks and kids meals. But not one employee passed by or even looked at our table until of course here comes our food and low and behold, guess what? \"Just kidding, I guess we had the chicken teriyaki afterall. So I just brought it all but I wont charge you for it.\" So we waited for 55 minutes. The manager visited finally. He apologized, and didn't charge us for the items that they were out of,  but not out of, that we had to wait 55 minutes for. Yay us! We would have much rathered paid full price and not have waited. And then we look like asshole parents who let our kids do whatever they want; completely disrupting other guests. We had everything boxed up, paid the bill, and left.. communication is everything. Instead they tried to ignore it and they train-wrecked. We are super easy going; especially being in the business. This experience came down to training and communication or the lack thereof. Anyways we will return, just not this particular location.",

    "text": "Date: December 28, 2016 Time : Around 7:00-8:30 PM Company: 4 adults, 1 child  I was excited to eat at Cheesecake Factory since most of my relatives were raving about the food quality and taste these guys offer. The waiting line was long since it's in an outlet mall so I already saw that coming. The receptionist informed me it would take around 40 minutes to get a table and we agreed.   We sat by the long bench BESIDE the recepionists desk because we didn't want to miss our names. 30 something minutes passed and I asked for an update. They said we were to be called next, just waiting for the table to be emptied, so okay. So far so good. A few minutes after, they called in a party of 5, then a party of 3, and then another party of 6. I was confused because they said we were next. Approached the employee who was informing guests that there were available bar stools for anyone who wants them. Rudely answered and argued with my brother. He was in my brother's face already, so I talked to the receptionists behind the desk. I was so shocked when they said they called us TEN TIMES ALREADY, the other said FOUR TIMES. WOW, talk about inconsistency. Again, we were seated BESIDE THE RECEPTIONISTS DESK. No way we couldn't hear them IF EVER THEY CALLED US. Asked for a manager, but he was impolite and inattentive. Tried explaining our situation and get an apology from him but what he did was straight on unprofessional. He shoved the paper with my name on it to let me know that we were getting a table now. The worst manager ever, or so I thought....  After seating at our table, another manager approached us, hoping for a better response, we tried explaining what happened, never listened, kept cutting our sentences and even had the nerve to tell us not to argue with him. We were explaining, not arguing. Even told us he'd talk to the crew right away, followed him with my eyes, he didn't even say a word to them. So arrogant and ill-mannered. Walked away without even apologizing.   They should thank the waitress they assigned to us. Made our experience a little tolerable.   SO I WANNA SAY THANK YOU, CHEESECAKE FACTORY FOR MAKING MY FIRST DINING EXPERIENCE THE WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Would have given no stars if it was possible.",
