I arrived before my husband and kids so the waitress came to take our drink orders. I order water for myself, Dr. Pepper for my honey and 2 lemonades for my kiddos. The lemonades came in nice plastics cups with lids. The only problem I had with this, is that my 7 y/old's lid had a fruit fly stuck underneath and there was a lliiitttlllee teeny black spec of something floating around. Now normally when there is something that was probably JUST alive resting in peace under your child's drink lid, that's a huge red flag. BUT we were SUPER cool about it. We alerted the waitress, who said nothing as she took his drink away.  Shortly after she comes back out with, what we assume is a new cup of lemonade. By this time we are starving and ready to place our order. I pick up his cup, a low and behold. THE SAMMMMEEE FLIPPIN FRUIT FLY IS STILLL CHILLLIN UNDER HIS LID!!  She got rid of the littttlee teeny spec but not the actual insect?????  At this point we walked out of the restaurant.  This place could have the BEST sushi in the world but careless service and complete disregard for cleanliness is unacceptable.. Makes me wonder how many bugs are actually in the FOOD!!",

    "text": "Start out with the good: service was great! The waitresses were quite nice and we were well tended to.   The real meat of this review (HAHA!) is that none of the fish had any flavor. This was the blandest and most mediocre sushi I've ever had. I actually ended up salting everything I ordered (which was a lot, because I did the All You Can Eat). Here's a good application of my opinion: my wife decided she would be adventurous and try some sushi this time. I ordered a roll with things I knew she'd like, and when it came out I refused to let her try any of it. I was worried she would be put off of trying sushi again because this was a very poor example of what she should expect.   The sauces were fine, which I'm not surprised about. Every sushi restaurant in town probably buys jugs of them from the same handful of distributors.   The rice was fine, which I'm not surprised about because it isn't supposed to taste like anything.  The rolls were wrapped a bit poorly. The ingredients were distributed unevenly so the end pieces had almost nothing in them but rice. They were also loose I'm really, really poor with chopsticks but I keep trying. Loose rolls are very, very difficult to pick up. I ate half of my food with my fingers instead.   Also, there was a lot of rice. The ratio of rice to fish to veg was definitely tilted toward rice, and definitely away from the fish. Not that it would have made much flavor difference -- the rice was more flavorful than the fish was -- but if I have the option of eating rice, which is completely empty of nutrition, and fish, which is exceptionally nutritious,the choice is clear.   And it is really irritating to pay $12 for a roll of mostly rice with a little bit of low-quality fish in it.",

I wont be coming back.",

There were so many options and I did enjoy the items I ordered. I admit that the amount of sauce they put on everything was a little overwhelming though. The price on the menu for AYCE was less than they actually charge, but only by a couple dollars and still very reasonable for dinner. Overall great sushi spot and I will def go back again.",

We were seated right away at a table (by choice). The service was outstanding. Waitress took our drink order as soon as we were seated. Kirin Light Large $6.00. The menu is huge and the waitress was back right away to take our order.   We ordered a \"ton\" of stuff, so I am not going to embarrass myself by listing it. Everything was so fresh and what I loved was that they were light on the rice. Most AYCE give you so much rice. The only complaint I have (not sure if it's legitimate) is that I ordered the screaming organism and I am used to the one at Sushi Fever so I was shocked when it arrived and was only 4 small pieces. I hope it's not that small if someone ordered it that was not doing AYCE. But I will say it was excellent.   I will def. be returning t this place. They were so nice and the fish was cold and so fresh. If you are looking for a new AYCE check this place out. They have been open a month.",

At first, I was a little bit put off because the restaurant was quite empty and quiet when we arrived. Though looking back, it was about 5pm on a Saturday, and as our meal carried on, more patrons filtered in. We were seated as the sushi bar and presented with menus, though since we intended to order the all you can eat option, we had to specify this and we're presented with  2 different laminated menus. The assortment of rolls we're plentiful, and the other items were pretty standard (gyoza, miso soup, seaweed salad...etc). Typically I go to these types of restaurants with a larger group and we order a large assortment and eagerly await our food, but since it was just myself and a friend, we were a bit hesitant to order too much and not be able to finish. Things worked out nicely since we were at the sushi bar and we simply would request each item from the gentleman behind the counter. Food arrived in a timely manner and beautifully decorated. Two items that stuck out for me were the garlic tuna (pictured) which had a very unique and delicious sauce to it, and the poke, which was seasoned very nicely and the fish was perfect. I will plan to return to this location soon!",

It is like you take the neglected California Roll from a local's casino buffet and pour twelve sauces on it to hide the quality of anything that would need to be fresh.    Their special rolls are all just cold tempura-ed matter drowned in bland sauces.  Seriously, the crap I attempted to eat here tonight wouldn't pass in a rural town in the Midwest and should definitely not be tolerated in any part of Las Vegas.  Next the service:  Three sushi chefs and two servers (one being the manager/owner?) were completely overwhelmed by four tables.  The waitress (who the Manager declared to us was brand new) struggled mightily to speak English and got 60% of order right within 5 minutes of ordering (3 out of 5 items) and then literally went on break for the next 30 minutes and we were abandoned...  When I got out of the seat and explained this to the other server (Manager), she said \"she will be back soon\" instead of offering to take our next round of items.  At this point me and my girlfriend decided to chalk it up as a bad meal, demanded the check, paid $55 for our mistake, and went to another restaurant down the street to start from scratch.  Read my other reviews, I am not unreasonable.  I just don't think anyone should throw away their hard earned money on this awful restaurant.",

When I walked in it felt really cozy and the employees made me feel really welcome. My favorite thing that I had there was the dragon ball. It was super delicious and I just couldn't get enough! I've been here a couple of times and I've loved every single experience. I've recommended this place to a couple of my friends and they all have loved it. This place is also a great place for friends to hang out. It's very chill and relaxing. The food is great and you can really catch up with friends. Everything about this place is great!",

You can do half rolls on many of their rolls as well. My boyfriend has an avocado allergy that we informed them of in the beginning and no matter who we ordered with we received not one dish with avocado on it which is very important and quite impressive.

But that should be because:  A) People don't generally eat as much for lunch as they do for dinner.  Or:  B)  Because you're not that busy at lunch and you're trying to get folks in the door.  NOT because you're being stingy with the portions.  On a positive note though, the sushi WAS quite delicious.  The rolls on the other hand were the absolute worst I've ever seen.  Poor execution, presentation and flavor.  Service was fine, friendly and acceptable.  IMO the chef was either lazy or unskilled (maybe the main guy was off today, IDK)  But I was expecting MUCH more from a sushi joint in Summerlin.  Stick with the SW part of town which has excellent spots like Fish-N-Bowl, Soho, Japaniero and Oyshi.",

We were there around 12 on a Tuesday. The rolls were huge, too much rice though and the rice didn't taste fresh. In fact, the rice didn't have any flavor to it. Considering they open at 11, I would've assumed that the rice would've tasted much fresher. The rolls themselves didn't have much flavor to them at all. It wasn't awful, but I probably won't be back, there are too many sushi places out there to try instead. Also, on the table there was a sign saying to check out their Yelp reviews because they have a 5 star rating. They have a 4 star rating so maybe they should remove the sign.",

Instead of AYCE, I usually opt for a la carte or lunch specials- the lettuce wrap app is as close to a riceless roll as you'll get here, but they do allow you to order handrolls sans rice, for an additional $1 each.  Lunch specials are on a separate menu. Even going during lunch, this menu is not provided upon seating. It's also not provided when you ask for it. I had to pull up their website menu on my phone before they brought over the lunch sushi combos list so I could order- kind of irritating. Other than that and forgetting my beverage for the duration of my visit, service was polite.  The lunch combo #3 is my favorite: miso soup and two gyoza, plus your choice of two special rolls from a limited list. The given options are just okay, most of them are shrimp tempura rolls. The namesake OMy roll and the Aladdin roll are both fairly plain, and the rice fell apart where sauces were used.",

We sat at the bar and got great service. We ordered a lot of their nigiri, as well as a few specialty rolls, and then I ended the meal with mochi (which was also included in AYCE).

It was a big disappointment. When we first stepped inside the place only three costumers and we can and about an hour after they open. There sushi looked appetizing from how they describe it on there all you can eat menu. Sadly when the food arrived on the table and finally get to see what the buzz was all about I felt betrayed by yelp. There sushi was bland , dull, and my last order of sushi looked disgusting. It looked like someone had poured pepto bismol on my sushi. I noticed while at my table they have bribe yelp users to rate them well by giving them a free drink , beer, and a mug. Never going back I wouldn't even eat here if it was free. I suggest going to sakana or Yama sushi instead I promise you it a thousand times better then this place.",

We are always on the lookout for quality neighborhood restaurants.   We were incredibly disappointed by this place! We mistook the name change to be a new restaurant, but the quality was so poor. Such a sad representation of sushi. The sizing of the fish was so small, but since the quality seemed poor, I'm not sure I would have wanted to eat a generous piece.   Needless to say, we left for our flight worrying if we would get food poisoning. Luckily nothing happened, but that's not a concern I ever want to have with a restaurant.",

Normally our strategy for sushi restaurants is doing the all you can eat on our first visit so we can determine our favorite rolls, and then we never do the all you can eat again. This is the first time I finished an all you can eat and thought to myself, \"I think I want to do this every time.\" The value you get in the all you can eat is just fantastic- the menu is almost overwhelming with how many choices there are! Hopefully it goes without saying at this point, but the sushi is AMAZING!!! The ratio of rice to fish is always spot on and every roll we've tried is just mouthwatering good and fresh (the tuna is soooooo good)! The staff is so incredibly attentive (without being pushy), we never found ourselves trying to get their attention because they always got to us first. The sushi chef, in particular, is such a sweet talented guy. We never had a long wait for our sushi either- it was up so quickly! I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place- I would dine here every night if I could!!",

Cons: -Couldn't share my all you can eat with my 2 years old.  -waiter didn't have an answer to half of our questions.    -what drinks do you have for kids?    -baked muscles apart of your all you can eat?    -didn't know what Tai was. -fish slices were thin and small. -half rolls were limited.

I've been here a few times and some days they are busy and I can expect slower service but when youre the only one in there... doesn't make much sense. Also, the fish tasted stale . Even tho it was a Monday the tempura shrimp tasted reheated and the tails were black . Highly disappointed because I love going to boca park.",

By the looks of it none of the other tables ordered AYCE. For some reason, it still took them 1.5 hr (on their policy, the limit for ayce is only 1 hr) to bring out 2 rolls and 5 nigiri orders.   The quality of the sushi is below any other AYCE place. The mackerel nigiri is utterly sour and the lion king roll tastes like it got dipped in sweet BBQ sauce.",

The service was fast and friendly. Everything I ordered came out within only a few minutes and was freshly made behind the sushi bar. The menu offers over 70 different sushi rolls (which all could be made as hand rolls if asked) and delicious sashimi choices. There's much more than just sushi here! Appetizers from veggie or shrimp tempura, edamame, gyoza, tofu, salmon or hamachi Kama, mussels, oshinko and much more. Also have great salads and soups. You can create your own Poke bowl; which is my personal favorite. If you're not a fish person, they also have Miso or Chicken Ramen and other non-seafood entrees. Please, try this place out and experience a wonderful meal and service! (:",

I figured I see it when I go to Boca Park shopping complex. I also like supporting the neighborhood restos and businesses when possible. It was bad! The food was awful. They didn't seem to know if food was meant to be hot or cold. The agedashi tofu was the worst I've ever had. Tempura shrimp, c'mon how can you serve it some parts are cold and some hot? The rice was very cold too. On top of that the server had no customer service. Perhaps the great comments or 4-star ratings were from a previous management or cooks or something because I don't normally leave reviews but I think people should know not to go here. Sure you probably have the least expensive all you can eat but it becomes expensive when there's nothing good to eat.",

I got the jalapeno popper and what a treat. With fresh spicy tuna and gooey, rich cream cheese plus a mildly spicy pepper I was in heaven.   That wasn't the best part though. The best was when my sushi chef said \"I know you.\" I was surprised since I was only there once before. He said you liked my sushi so much you made me pose for a picture on Yelp. And he was right!   Original review: Super friendly and attentive service and excellent variety of sushi. All of the ingredients were fresh and the rolls were made right in front of me. At $5 a regular roll, the prices are really reasonable.",

We were greeted with accommodation and asked what we wanted to drink. Hot green tea for me, iced green tea for Ness please.  On the table a paper menu with a pen. Ooouuu all you can eat! I got excited. But our server removed the pen and paper menu... and the regular menu... Psych. Handed us laminated flip over menus. I was like hmmmm opposite from other AYCE places. Instead she wrote down our AYCE choices. It works... We can \"roll\" with that.  Didn't know there was AYCE here. Only wanted to eat sushi. Front and back menu listing tons of selections. Oh and they have boba pearl drinks!   24 side appetizers ???!!! If you just did one of each with just appetizers, you're set. No need to eat the next day - just finish digesting.  105 sushi choices ???!!! Can we download an app that helps us decide? Hey Danny didja find out yet where we can DL the 'slap em upside the head' app? I think it will come in handy for this. Categories included:  Nigiri, baked, special, tempura, regular, deepfried, and veggie.  By the way, who's your mommy? I can tell you she's hot. Find her on the AYCE menu. Make sure you have an ice cold drink nearby.  1 dessert per person included: ice cream or mochi... If you can still fit in your belly.  Huge siiiigh. Feeling so full already just talking about all this great food. I'll just give em a five. Can't find a reason not to sheesh. Pleasant attentive service, attractive atmosphere, clean environment, delightful cuisine flavor and presentation, timeliness with order to delivery on the table, average pricing, and AYCE includes dessert. Who wants to complain?",

We sat right in front of the chef and began to look at the menu. There were a few things that caught my eye.   After a few minutes, we placed our order and soon got our food.

The service is amazing. The waitress is so nice and the sushi chefs are always interested in talking to you while making sushi. I honestly don't think I would go anywhere else, I've been coming here with my boyfriend and by myself for the past two months frequently. I highly recommend it!",

It wasn't until 10 minutes until I got asked what I wanted to drink, and 15 minutes until I got offered the menu.  When the sushi came, I asked for spicy ponzu, and the waitress never came with it.  Bottom line, the service here is terrible.  Luckily for this place, I'm the kind of person where if the food is amazing, regardless of how good or bad the service is, then I will be back.  With that said, the sushi here was pretty tasty, and I will be back in the unforeseen future.    I'm kind of hoping I just caught these guys on a bad night, because I'm up for giving these guys another shot and hope to have a better experience with their service next time I come here!",

Upon walking it, hit by the overwhelming smell of dirty frying grease. yuck! And I wish I was exaggerating! We had to wash our clothes when we got home. It was disgusting.  We ordered the sashimi salad, which had a picture in the menu that looked tasty! Seasonal greens topped with a yummy selection of thick fresh sashimi. What we got was a fist full of iceberg lettuce and some paper thin slices tossed on with out care, dressing on the side. The good part, the dressing was actually pretty good!  We had some confusion on the sushi, we ordered one special roll, and received another. Our waitress told us it was a typo on the menu, and that the right name was on another roll a few down......ummmmm OK. We got that worked out, still not very good, sadly. Neither were the other rolls we ordered.  I sat wondering, how can this place have all these 5 star reviews? What are we missing? Or are we hitting a bad night? Then I look over and see a sign on the table that stated \"with your great Yelp review, you get a free beverage and a complimentary tea cup to take home.\"  OK... so I guess a lot of people needed the free drink? Or the tea cup?? Am I the only one that finds this a bit odd? Coercing good reviews for free schwag?  Regardless, we will probably not go back. Bummer!",

We walked in and only seen the chef there so we seated ourselves but within a few seconds our server came by to take our order for drinks.   We got all you can eat and majority of their rolls were pretty good, better than most places I've been too (yummy sushi grill/kobe)  All the rolls we ordered came out quickly! It was one after another, we got done with one set and the next one came out.  Spider roll/kiss of fire were both amazing  The Johnny roll isn't like the ones other places make. The tempura part felt really empty and all I could taste was cucumber and the tempura. Seaweed salad was fresh and wasn't watery like some places.  Service was good, she stayed on top and made sure we were doing fine.   I would come back if I'm in the area again!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try to this place out on a whim. It's a great sushi location in Summerlin, in the Boca Park shopping center. It's a decent size sushi place with beautiful Japanese decor. Our server was also in a gorgeous top that went wonderfully with the decor. Our server was sweet, and I could see the sushi chef took pride in each roll he made.  We went with the AYCE menu for dinner which was priced the standard of $24.99. They have an impressive menu, and we didn't even get to try everything because our bellies got full. From the apps we had gyoza, which reminded me of the Filipino dish lumpia, probably because it had pork and veggies inside. Still good though. I always like to try something out of the ordinary and samples their avocado and cucumber roll from their veggie menu. This was a bit dry for my taste, but with some soy sauce, better. From their nigiri menu we tried the garlic tuna, garlic hamachi (yellowtail), and super white. I was impressed with both garlic choices, but I was disappointed by the super white. Super white is my favorite thing to order whenever I go for sushi, but this one was very different from how most places serve it.  It had no sauce and it was wrapped in a tiny sliver of seaweed. It was dry, but was fine after dipping in some soy sauce. From the regular roll I took a gander at the spicy hamachi which was yummy and not spicy. From the special roll menu we tried the Aloha (so tasty if you enjoy the garlic ponzu sauce, which I do. It's my favorite from this evening), shrimp lover (good as well), dragon (on point for the typical dragon), Nevada queen (I hated the cream cheese in this, but he enjoyed it), Summerlin (sweet flavor;similar to the dragon. My boyfriend enjoyed the avocado on it.), moon dog (another garlic ponzu flavor), and snow white (this was my boyfriend's favorite because it was  different and refreshing. I liked how crunchy it was). At the end instead of an ice cream treat which is included in the AYCE, we decided to pay more and have the teas. My boyfriend went for the Thai tea, no boba. They took a different spin on it, more creamy, but in a good way. I saw matcha milk tea, and I knew I had to try it, but with boba of course! It was refreshingly good. The server told me this was a new item on their menu and was enthused to hear how much I liked it.  This place is worth your money. I know we'll be back.",

We enjoy the low key atmosphere, relaxed style, and of course the authentically prepared sushi by master craftsmen (and women). We always enjoy the food and experience, and am almost hesitant to recommend them, so they remain discreet, and not become mainstream. If so they may lose the relaxed atmosphere we most appreciate. That said, they are one of our favorite local sushi bars :)",

Our waitress was very slow at bringing out the food, I noticed our food sitting on the counter for a while before she would bring it out (this happened multiple times). When we tried to order she would rush us through it & would stop us in the middle of ordering so she could go tell the sushi chef...just very unprofessional. The sushi is the lowest quality I've ever had, The shrimp tempura was stale & the quantity of fish they include in every roll is tiny. Overall bad experience. Lastly, the bathrooms are a mess! Yuk!",

The service was so bad I almost cried. First of all, I had some stuff coming, but wanted more of something else... this waitress has the nerve to tell me \"but you have some stuff coming\". Okay? I want more stuff.  Then my friend ate her salmon kama, and another friend wanted one too, We ask the waitress for another one and she said \"you already had one\".  Excuse me? Another friend wants one now....what is the big issue?  Also, I had called and asked if they had Uni, the lady on the phone said they did. That is the first thing I order, and they said they didn't have it today. We were the only people in the restaurant when we came in as well.   I will never come here again. So rude and disrespectful and I was so uncomfortable.  I had to even go up to the bar and pick up my orders and bring it to my table myself instead of the waitress doing it because she was no where to be found.  Last but not least, it took 45 minutes to make a cucumber roll. The end.",

I have never ordered the \"All you can eat\" sushi but all of the sushi I have ordered I have thought be extremely delicious with very fair portions. The waitress that works in the evenings is very kind, and more floats through the restaurant, (I typically have to flag her down when I need something, but its not that big of a deal because it is a small restaurant.)  Every time I have come to O-my Sushi I have felt that I got a lot of great sushi for a very fair price. Its a place that I love to take my family whenever we need a place to go for a quick bite.

There is one person currently making the rolls and one person waiting tables.   There are only 2 other groups of people in here, but it took 20 minutes to get a screaming o order to us.   Beware, there is a 1 hour limit and ordering rolls takes about 15 minutes for it to come to the table.  When we walked in you can just feel the place needs a good cleaning with some Clorox but the SO insisted on eating here.  Will def not be back and I suggest they clean this place and use way less rice for their future patrons. I feel like if I wanted a bowl of rice I would have ordered that. Our table randomly has a different texture going on in the middle of it. The menus need to be wiped down between customers as well, you can feel the grime on it.   And oddly the place smells like sage, praying I am not ill after eating here. Although, I think I would have actually had to of had some sushi with my rice for that to of occurred.",

As I sat down to browse the menu,  I couldn't have been more amazed! 80 plus different rolls ! Wow where do I begin? Luckily, my friends ordered a bunch of different rolls for sharing. Service here is a bit slow as there is only one waitress and one sushi chef. I didn't mind the wait as it gave me time to catch up with my friends. Once the sushi came out, I couldn't keep track of all the rolls that came out. I can say that I did enjoy the summerlin roll, spicy tuna with tempura roll,aloha roll and the sweetheart roll.  Enjoyable meal with awesome company!",

I came in on a Saturday night with a couple friends who are regulars here and my boo. We did the AYCE dinner which came out to around $24.99 a person, very reasonable pricing.   As for food we had quite a variety of things. My favorites were the Spoon Shooters, Screaming Orgasm, and the Garlic Hamachi. All three of these were delicious and I'd highly recommend trying them. As for the rolls we enjoyed a few different ones, but nothing really stood out as being spectacular. I can't say I tried anything I hated though so that's always a win.  The service was a little spotty though so I'm glad we sat at the sushi bar. There was a couple of times when I'd have to ask for a water refill or remind the waitress of the sake we ordered. Hopefully they can work on that a bit. Overall I enjoyed this place and would come back again.",

But when our party of 8 came into the restaurant, we were hardly greeted by our waitress and did not feel very welcome. Our waitress often walked away while we were trying to order and our food came out very slowly, which left the others and I anxiously waiting for our food to be delivered. The fact that our food came out so slowly made us question whether or not we were going to be able to order everything and be satisfied within the 1 hour window of allotted to you when you order all you can eat sushi.   The food is good and the sushi selection is great, but the service was very disappointing and underwhelming. The restaurant was not busy at the time as there was only two other tables occupied at the time. I definitely wouldn't want to come back. My expectations of customer service and eating experience was not met unfoetunate",

The location is in a good area; close to our home. We've been to this restaurant before it was renamed to O My Sushi. It has improved much.  -- Edit --  We stopped going to this sushi joint due to bad experience. All the times that we went, there was only one person waiting tables, which was slow to refill our drinks. One of my favorites here is the shrimp shumai. However, every time we come back to give this place another try and I order it, they're always out of shrimp shumai. They also added bubble smoothie drinks to their menu. Tried it and so far, they taste like medicine. I suspect they are using powder for flavor rather than real fruits. I rather pay for real fruits instead.",

Lady who was our server was very attentive and nice but the reason for the two stars was that the sushi was honestly really not great and the chef who was making the sushi was really taking his time making them. He was taking a while either because he didn't feel the urgency to make the sushi fast on a dead weekday or because of the fact that he was talking very VERY loudly to the only man who was at the bar. Overall, would never come here again, might as well  drive the extra 10-15 mins and head over to Yama or Kaya.",

At one point we were tempted to go to the Wendy's next door since the food arrived so slowly. There were 6 patrons in the place at the time. It seems like they deliberately slowed AYCE orders, even though they charge $22 for lunch. Many of the rolls are covered in a sticky sweet tempura sauce. One sushi roll was ice cold as if it had been in a refrigerator.  Better alternatives a mile north on Rampart.",

I totally understand pacing and not wasting, but this is just a bit too long to really \"feel\" the indulgent pleasure of AYCE. I could have eaten more, but time was UP!

It wasn't really busy or anything, but just took forever to get the orders after they were placed. Four of us went and did the AYCE. The menu is pretty good sized but to me seemed basic, not creative. One of the hot items I ordered, the dynamite, came out cold. Not warm, but cold. Other than that the food was good, not great. If I was in the area and wanted sushi, I would go again but I wouldn't make a trip just to go. My wife felt the same as I. Her response when I asked how she liked it was, \"meh.\"",

    "text": "Unbelievable.  This was our second visit to this place and will be our last.  After reading all of the yelp reviews, we decided to give it a try.  Wasn't so bad the first time.  Our visit tonight was unbelievable.  Service was extremely slow and they weren't even busy.  There were 3 other parties there when we arrived and because it took so long for our food, all 3 of them left.  So we were the only ones there.  I ordered a sexy lady roll.  When I picked up the 4th piece there was a very long black hair.  I put the hair on my plate and swirled it in a circle.  We called the waitress over and she just smiled and took the plate out back.  She came back a short time later to question me as to whether the hair was in the roll or on the outside.  Told her it was on the inside. She goes back out back. When she finally comes back out she says that it is a dyed hair and not the hair of the lady that was making sushi earlier when we walked in. So I asked her if she was accusing me of lying and this was my hair.  She just stood there with a stupid grin on her face. She said there was no way it could have been on the inside because they cut the roll with a knife and the hair wouldn't have been that long.  The manager or owner never came over  to our table. They never offered any comp of our meal only stood there accusing me of planting the hair there.  Yes I have dyed hair but my hair is red and short.  So fuck off bitch.  It was the lady that was making sushi when we got there.  She had long black hair and was only pinned back with a bow.  If I could give them minus stars that would be my rating.  STAY AWAY from this place.  They need to close this dump down once and for all!",

    "text": "Came here with high expectations, but my friends and I left dissatisfied. We came to what seemed would be a nice dinning experience on a weekday and boy were we wrong. I have never experienced such horrible service! It all started with the waitress, she had to repeatedly confirm our order because she didn't write it down correctly. We all did all you can eat and seriously need to consider changing their name to You'll never Eat Sushi being that our entire order was coming out one by one every 20-25min or not coming out at all. We had to ask were our rolls were at several times and all we got was that they were coming. The restaurant was not busy for them to be that slow especially when there are four people making the sushi. One of the orders I placed in my first round came two hours later. You can tell the other diners were upset as they also would ask what was taking so long. We even had to ask for the waitress to refill our waters as they were not doing that either. I'm not the type of person to complain, but I was sure livid! But what made it worse is that they didn't even seem apologetic even after I expressed how upset we were. She was like yes the kitchen is slow. Really, that is all you can tell me. I must admit the rolls were good but definitely not worth the wait. We were there for over three hours and asked to speak to a manager since we felt that we should get a discount for what we had endured. But no manager was available. I was ready to walk out of that place because supposedly they could not even offer us a discount or just simply an apology. I'm not the person to just walk away and not pay, but was close to it after we finally continued to dispute our bill and got them to give us some type of compensation which we told her we would only pay them what we feel we should pay or walk out. I'll never come here again and would suggest you think twice about dinning here!",

Ok ok ok after I originally wrote this review I saw everyone raving about the Johnny sooooo of course I had to try it.   This roll right here, this roll right here omg who would think of wrapping the sushi with cucumber instead of seaweed and rice like normal. At first it's a little strange you are like wtf it's crunchy but not a normal sushi crunchy and then the cucumber hits and it's sooooo refreshing. Oh my Sushi I am in love!",

    "text": "Went here last night when we were in the area for Total Wine due to Yelp reviews. Staff was super friendly and fast with taking our orders. My husband and I got the AYCE ($24.95) and were not disappointed. We also got a Yuzu flavored Sake drink that was 10% alcohol (Super Delicious).   We started off with a few apps that included Agedashi Tofu, Maru Wha and the Spoon Shooter. My favorite was definitely the Spoon Shooter. We followed up with some Nigiri and Special Rolls. My favorite nigiri included the Garlic Tuna, Sweet Shrimp (With fried heads), Tamago, and Unagi. All of the special rolls were A+ in my book. We got the Mimi Roll, Princess Irene Roll, Captain Roll and the Rolley Rice. I would suggest everyone get the Rolley Rice even though it isn't a roll but its the first time I've had such good   We were in and out within the hour. Wanted to try more things on the menu but was too full. Will have to come back again to try more menu items!",

Though iust say I am happy that I came here so I can warn other users who come because of reviews. I rather spend an hour in transportation to not waist my money here.  The waiter is a lady that can't speak english to save her life.  DONT WALK AWAY RUN!   As I was writing this review they changed my opinion from a one star to a 0! when they brought this role that looked like it had pink vomit on it. For those who wonder about flavor let me describe sushi here BLAND, DULL, FLAVORLESS.  To wrap it up I wouldn't eat here free I hope that this place doesnt rip you of because I felt cheated off money.   Lastly got to yama sushi on flamingo and sakana on Maryland parkway great sushi.",

Had our first order in within 10mins of being there but took another 10mins for the first order to show up, btw any child will have to order from menu my 3yr old had to wait about 20-25mins to get a spam musubi and some fries. The dragon ball and screaming orgasm are pretty much the only things here I tried that was different from other sushi places we have eaten at and it was pretty good. All in all the sushi was good but not good enough to make this one of the regular spots.  Overall:3.5/5",

You can tell they are cutting corners , I would rather pay more money and get better sushi . Take your all you can eat sushi needs elsewhere , there are a ton of other places in town that are MUCH better .",

First she was going to place me behind a wall, but I wanted to be near the tv since the marathon was on,  so sat closer to the door at the table that seated four; right in front of the tv.  Well I guess the manager(older woman) didn't like where I was seated in the resturant, and made me move to the table directly right across from the table I was seated-which was behind an artifical tree.  She gives me a lame excuse  \"since your going to be seated with a party of 3 this table is for 4 or more.\" I question her motives stating \"the table your requesting me sit at is right next to this one, and it has 4 chairs too.\" Not one to put up a fuss I moved to the table behind the tree  (still in sight of the tv) and next to a couple(2) sitting at a 4 sitter table as well. Lo and behold nobody sat at that table in fact they seated a couple with a toddler child 15 minutes after my arrival (see attaches image)   The experience was so mortifying that I had no words- as the entire resturant seen this older woman direct me a \"black\" woman to be out of eyes view for no reason, besides my skin color . My appetite is now ruined- hate that I can't review the resturant as a whole, but CUSTOMER SERVICE is equally as important. The joke is, when my guest arrived  (white couple) they questioned why are we behind this tree?!   PLEASE NOTE- I WOULD NEVER CALL A PERSON AND/OR ESTABLISHMENT RACIST IF IT IS NOT WARRANT; AND AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAD INTERACTION VS BEING JUDGE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF MY GENETIC MAKEUP.

But she was moving quickly. For what I've mentioned so far they deserve 5 stars. However, the ventilation is horrible. I now wreak of old thick oil. My kids needed to be taken outside twice due to the heavy oil smell. It felt like we were covered in grease, and breathing grease. That was horrible!! Thick heavy greasy air!! I need a shower and fresh air STAT!!!!",

    "text": "The sushi is ok. Not bad. Definitely not great. But overall this place is a joke. Service was terrible. I literally ordered like a half roll of something and two orders of nigiri several times separately, only for it to be delivered almost 15-20 minutes later! And this was day time! I'm talking 4 PM with only eight other people in the restaurant (Yes, I counted) and with 2 sushi chefs. No excuses! One time I even asked about the status of two nigiri orders I placed and the waitress who originally took that order got confused and asked if I would like to order again instead? This place makes me want to go vegan. By eating here you already halfway are with all the rice they put on their rolls. I wouldn't eat here again even if I saw it at 90% off on Groupon. Regretting my usual spots of Goyemon and Sakana.",

Took about 15 minutes to finally get the waitress to acknowledge us, and turns out my daughters food wasn't put in. 35 minutes into an hour limit on AYCE and my daughter still had not received her food.........

The fish wasn't the greatest and the fish portion were unreasonably small when ordering nigiri. We were cut off b.c of their 1 1/2 dinner time limit. This upset me the most b.c we were waiting for or food longer than actually eating. I was very disappointed after reading the reviews on Yelp, I had very high hopes for this place.
