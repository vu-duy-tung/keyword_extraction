We sat down and I ordered a Michelada with pescado sareandeado. All I can say is the presentation looked good. The fresh made tortillas were great but the Michelada was extremely salty as well as the fish. Way too salty for my buds. Also 65 bucks seemed too stiff for this.",

I love how I was asked because some places make them too spicy that it over powers the drink. My cocktail came out within 15 min which was served in a molcajete (a Mexican traditional tool to make sauces) the portion was just right. The hand made tortillas were delicious.   My overall experience was great. I am glad I decided to eat off the strip to eat something more homemade. I will absolutely be returning back once I get the chance to go to Sin City.",

They ask you how hot you like your aguachiles in a scale of 1 to 10 and even though i got a 7 they weren't hot at all, just very lemony which I didn't mind. Fish tacos were very good and had a nice spice to them. Micheladas are okay I've had better.This is a very small place to eat but quality and presentation are impressive. Will eat here when I come back to Vegas.",

My only complaint is that the clam was added in its open shell, and the dish was so hot and bubbly, that I couldn't easily remove it.  This meal has an awesome presentation, and continues to sizzle at the table for quite some time!  The white rice they serve with some dishes is limey, and quite tasty...not the usual Spanish rice (though they serve that too).  Yes, the restaurant is in a run down area and looks pretty iffy on the outside, but inside was clean and definitely worth the trip.  Everyone at the table raved at how good their selection was, from the fish filet to the ceviche, to the shrimp cocktail.  Will definitely go there again when in Vegas!!",

The food is great and the service even better. My 5 year old son ordered a simple fish fillet grilled and they made it just like he likes it.

I used to be a Las Islitas customer BC of their music, but their food is no good so I decided to try a new place.  I had a small shrimp cocktail and a taco gobernador n my husband had a shrimp ceviche tostada and a michelada. Micheladas were huge and only $5!!! Everything, including their salsa for their chips, which was authentic and spicy, was absolutely delicious. The waitress was awesome.  She took the time to treat us like people, not like another number in line.   I am definitely returning, although I will give my criticism: $10 for a small shrimp cocktail is a couple of dollars too much. I would say $7-8 is a fair price for that size. The shell they use for the taco tastes like something you would get at Taco Bell. Next time I go, I will request the taco on a real fried tortilla or a soft corn tortilla. Looks like they have a Juan Gabriel impersonator on Saturdays! Can't wait to go back!",

When you want to get away from all the fancy, over priced, overhyped hotel restaurants, and are craving authentic Mexican mariscos this is the place to visit. The mariscos are incredible and remind me of the mariscos I ate in Nayarit years ago. Their shrimp empanadas are to die for, the torre de mariscos is as delicious as it is aesthetically pleasing, the shrimp molcajete is sooo extremely satisfying and their pinaviche (shrimp ceviche with mango, pineapple and orange served in a half hollowed out pineapple) is such a refreshing and delicious take on ceviche. On Friday's they have karaoke night and it's actually pretty entertaining. I just wish the place was bigger, it only has about 10-12 tables. I would skip out on the aguas frescas.",

I did not like it at all. The meat was so overcooked and tough. Am I eating beef jerky? The beans that came with it was so oily and greasy. Chorizo had no flavor and it was a crumbling mess. I took one bite of the cactus and didn't eat the rest. The only thing I liked was the Mexican cheese.  Also, noticed the shrimp was not deveined in the aguachiles so cleaning shrimp poop was a joy. They didn't honor the free horchata when you check in which I was turned off by. It irritates me when businesses don't honor stuff. The waiter looked peeved too when I asked about the check in.  I don't know if I'll be back. The service was good until the check in part at the end. The empanadas were good and I have enjoyed other shrimp dishes there on previous visits but damn, that molcajete turned me off.",

She offered the special buy one get one Blue Moon and as we were going to have a beer anyway we took the offer.  All was good until the bill came and she charged us $12 for the 2 BOGO beers. (4 beers total).  This is a total rip off when you can have any domestic or imported beer on there menu every day for $3.99. So as far as we were concerned they just raised the price on the beer to $6 to cover for the BOGO.  We could have had 4 imports for $16. So we really only got 1 free. Maybe it was our fault for assuming but we also felt a little screwed over.",

Good was an understatement! This place is literally amazing. We had to stop by again the following morning before we made our drive back home. My husband would work in Vegas often and he stopped Everytime, as we do Everytime we make the trip out. Anytime I have friends or family in Vegas, I always give them the address so they can try it for themselves. This place literally can't be put into words. The food is the best, the service, even better and the owner always makes you feel like family. I will continue to recommend this place to everyone. If you haven't tried it, you're truly missing out.",

    "text": "When you think of Mariscos you think of the beach. Not Vegas, or the desert.  But here we are.  First things first. You WILL fill up on those damn chips and salsa. I normally hate chips and salsa. It always seems like they take 2-day old stale chips with whatever garbage left-over salsa from the night before and slide it in front of you.  But as I write this, my mouth waters for the spicy-ness of the salsa they serve here. I almost ruined my meal by filling up on chips and salsa.....  So spicey in fact that I had to get up and grab a handful of hot fritos to quench that spicey craving.  Moving on.  We had a party of 6 with 5 seperate checks and our waitress did an amazing job of keeping track of us all. She never missed a beat.  The food was delicious. I had the camarones a la diabla and they tasted really damn good.  The reason I knocked off a star for this establishment was because the waitress asked how spicey I wanted it. Now.... the fact that my mouth was on the verge of fire cause of the salsa, I wanted more spicey.  She asked me on a level of 1 to 10, how spicey I wanted my food and I said 10. She asked me 'Are you sure?'  This question took me back to a time when someone asked me that while placing a hot wings order and I said yes.   I ended up getting the ring of fire.  I felt like the salsa was level 2 so I asked for level 5 fearing I would die if I got level 10.  Fast forward to eating my delicious meal and there was no spicey whatsoever.  I felt robbed. I wanted to sit there uncomfortably fanning my mouth asking for water.  I'm glad this place is sort of a hidden gem. Keeps all the asshole out-of-towners (no worries, I feel that way about you all anyways) away and hungover on the strip.",

    "text": "Mariscos Playa Escondida had nearly perfect reviews on yelp when I first found out about it, which made it a perfect candidate for a date night. We got here around 8:30 on a Friday night. The restaurant is in a ghetto area and you can easily miss it if you aren't paying attention to your GPS. When we walked in, it was full of customers, and the interior looked like something you'll find in truck stop restaurants of third world country, same with the smell. I ordered the horchata drink that was free with the yelp check in (extra small glass half full of ice, but hey its free).   We ended up getting molecajete, which contained skirt steak, shrimp, cheese, grilled cactus and grilled green onions in a stone bowl. It was an unique appetizer, the steak and shrimp were pretty good. The steak was tender, but little greasy. However the cactus was pretty sour and didn't jive with the whole dish. May be it's best as a decoration.   Our main meal orders contained shrimp in spicy sauce and fillted fish in spicy sauce with rice and beans. The sauce was perfect, however the seafood was even better. The fish and the shrimp were very fresh and tender the sauce complimented both of the dished perfectly.   This restaurant could have been a perfect 4 star restaurant in my book, but it needs to look cleaner and the service has to be better. They are charging more money than Lindo Michoacan , so I would except the quality in terms of hospitality to be there. But don't get me wrong the food was very good.",

We got the surf and turf molcajete, tostadas de ceviche, empanadas, agua Chile ,and a coctel. The service was quick and easy. We start eating and then my mom complains that the  lemon that they used was bitter, keep in mind that my mom doesn't complain ever lol. We tried it and yes indeed , it was bitter. My mom is good at Thai stuff because she's a caterer to Mexican food, and she said that the lemons that they used  where not good. They probably used the small yellow Mexican limes. Well they changed her ceviche and used another lemon. Then I tried my agua chiles............... Same thing the lemon/lime was bitter lol but I was to emberresed to ask them to change it since they where being super friendly with us. Everything else was really good. The empanadas where to die for!! My coctel de camaron, wasn't all that. The shrimp was a bit chewy , sign that they over cooked it. I'm from LA so we have super fresh sea food all over, including small hole in walls, or even \"loncheras\" so my palate is used to something different. Definitely will not be coming back.",

We were very pleased with customer service and of course the food was phenomenal. You must try the shrimp empanadas! Great after a long night of drinking. Another plate that was very tasty was the mojara a la diabla. Great taste and very filling. Oh and let's not forget about the aguachiles they were excellent! So if you're in Vegas come give this place a try!",

It's hidden in the corner of a shopping center, and maybe you can see a sign for it somehow but I don't remember seeing it from the road.   I suggest you make a point to find this place though because it's a really decent spot for mariscos. It's small but comfortable inside. Our server was very friendly and helpful.   Beer is pretty cheap here, which is always a plus.  The chips and salsa are okay. Chips were served cold which is kind of a bummer. The sauce had a sweet, canned tomato taste at first, but the flavor finishes off with an unusually spicy kick, so I can't really hate it.  Our dinner was great though. I got the filet with Diablo sauce. It was a huge piece of white fish smothered in spicy red sauce with sauteed onions. The beans and rice it came with were very good, although I would have like a little bit more. My wife loved her shrimp cocktail. I didn't try it but it looked wonderful. The ceviche was delicious and very vibrant.  Overall, this place surprised me with how great the food is despite its appearance and odd location. I'm gonna have to give it four stars, and I'll definitely be back again soon!",

The horchata is probably the best horchata I've ever had- even in Mexico lol. The place is kind of small so when it's crowded it's not the most comfortable place to be in but it is definitely worth it! I probably go here way more times than I should. I love it!",

He was very attentive and on top of everything! He makes me laugh everytime too! I believe he is related to the owner in some ways? A son? Whatever and whomever -he is amazing!

The place is in the very corner, you might miss it if you don't really look for it. I have been here a few times, for lunch and dinner. The staff is super quick and friendly, we were always seated right away (except once when they were busy), they brought out waters and chips and salsa as soon as we sat. They play live music on weekends I think, could get a little loud when you are trying to have a conversation but fun at the same time.   Always order their prepared oysters which comes with shrimp and octopus ceviche on top! Sooooo good every time! Another favorite is their empanadas, the stuffing is delicious, the empanadas are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, the sauce that comes with it has a nice kick to it but not crazy spicy! Perfection!!   Shrimp cocktail is also really good! I feel like everything on their menu is good, the fried fishes with different sauces you can choose, their shrimp is also really good! They have different sizes of seafood platter to choose from, a small can feed up to 4-5 people and it comes with everything you could ever want!   Their michaladas are awesome! Large cup with seasoning on the rim, comes with shrimp cocktail, cucumber slices, and even an oyster inside the drink! The Hibiscus tea is also really good, you can also get the tea with wine if you want!!   What I really like about this place is the consistency! The food comes out the exact same every time in terms of tastes, quality, portion... have not been disappointed!!",

It was not busy at all we were the first customers of the day and it was only Tuesday so that would explain the reason why it wasn't so busy at first, let me tell you the SERVICE WAS INCREDIBLE the owner's son took care of us, he explained the menu and their specials. He suggested we try their MOLCAJETE since I mentioned I was craving some steak. I listened to him and ordered it and shared it with my niece. I was not disappointed it was enough for 2 people and some. Forgot to mention the rest of the staff was super friendly and the fresh hand made tortillas were OMG GOOD!",

And I'm really glad I did. The empanada looked plan but it was actually tasty. Love the crunch of the shell and the inside the shrimp was so good. The inside was filled with shrimp, onions, tomato and garlic. I guess that why it's so tasty. Oh yes and my shrimp cocktail was very fulfilling to me got my craving out. The hubby ordered the Camarones a la diabla. Now that was delish, lots of shrimp. They didn't skimp out on us which were great.   The service was good. When I needed service they attended to us. Which is great, I didn't have to flag them down. It wasn't too crowded but just the right amount for us to be served fast and friendly.  It's not a huge restaurant so you may miss it. But keep a look out. It is inside a plaza so you will be sharing your parking. This place I will visit again, since the empanada was really delish.",

So I am telling you right now that this place is hands down the best in Las Vegas.. but it's not for everybody. Meaning! That if your the kind of person that thinks Taco Bell is Mexican food you should probably just go back there. If your trying to keep up with the Joneses you probably won't even find the place. It doesn't have a big sign with lights or windows with people eating dinner. It's a little private place that is unbelievable awesome. The price is amazing and the service was unbeatable for our party 12... ask for Esther she's a sweetheart and worked her tail off to make everyone happy.. I've been to a lot of places here in Vegas and when I tell you this is the best it's the best. NUMBER ONE. And please I don't care how Full you are you must get dessert.

I always get their Horchata & so far, it's the best Horchata I've had in Vegas. For an appetizer, I highly recommend their shrimp empanadas. It's like shrimp ceviche in a crispy empanada accompanied with a delicious green spicy sauce (I like to put this sauce on everything while I'm there).  You can never go wrong with their mocajete with carne asada, shrimp, AND chicken. It even comes with grilled cactus, which is surprisingly tasty! This visit, however, I tried the Tubbz tacos & asked for the shrimp a la diabla. Oh man, the combination of spicy shrimp, melted cheese, & a crispy shell is phenomenal!",

I would definitely come back here when in Vegas. Our host Beto was very kind and helpful in choosing their popular items and arranging to our liking of food.

The owner's son ( so sorry I forgot his name) welcomed us warmly and led us to our seats.   We let him know we are New Yorkers but now call Vegas home and love the independent mom and pop restaurants. He told us to close the menu and let him create a meal  based on what seafood we like. We started with the free salsa and chips that were better than any I have ever tasted with a powerful pepper Kick!  I chose the ceviche topped on a corn tortilla while the hubby had loaded fresh oysters topped with ceviche. The taste was so fresh and amazing; my hubby was in heaven! The shrimp empanadas were stuffed with shrimp with a delicate thin dough. Perfect!   For the main entree I chose the half pineapple loaded with seafood and cheese. Euphoria! I loved every bite. Will order this again. Hubby had the whole red snapper served with rice and beans saute with onions and peppers. The spice was up there but he pulled through like a trooper!   We are already planning our next trip and can't wait to bring friends that appreciate authentic Mexican seafood. Can't wait to return!",

I loved it.  I took yelpers' advice and tried the aguachile shrimp tostada, the shrimp empanadas along with a small guacamole. Chips were warm, shrimp was clearly made / marinated in lime upon my order because they still had that velvety-raw mouthfeel. The lime/salt/chili kick was great. I ordered an 8 heat level and my server side-eyed me...you really want it that hot? I did -- but I think she adjusted because it was definitely not super hot, but it was delicious nonetheless.   Please note, food is not cheap - but you wouldn't want it to be since they specialize in seafood dishes. They're also closed Mondays which is worthy of another nod. (No fish deliveries on Sunday so fish is always less than stellar on Mondays...) Nice to note that they are busy and do a brisk business which is what you want to see. It's definitely worth the trip. Lots to taste and try. For those who aren't interested in seafood, you've got options, but seafood is definitely the star here.   Even though they take credit cards, the machine may or may not be working so to be safe bring cash -- $20 per person minimum without beer.    Several large tables were enjoying lunch so they can accommodate a few groups, but not much...but the small size made it even more enjoyable -- and probably made the dishes feel that much larger...",

Had the (huge) mixed seafood ceviche as an appetizer and mentioned to the owner that I usually made it at home with lime and I didn't taste any in his.  He explained that his mother (the cook) used a tomato based sauce for the mixed seafood ceviche and a lime based sauce for the shrimp--and that next time I was in that I could ask for the lime sauce if I wanted it.  Neato!    Everything was exceptional and we left stuffed --and with a doggie bag for morning.  Will be back..",

Off the bat the chips and salsa came out and that fresh homemade salsa was out of this world. I am literally still drooling from it.   We ordered the fish and shrimp ceviche and the empanadas for appetizers and were blown away. So fresh and just delicious. We then ordered the family sized molcajete which had chicken, steak, shrimp, chorizo, avocado, catcus, onions, so much and literally every single item was better than the next. My friends and I cannot wait to go back again. I had my leftovers the morning after and it was still so ridiculously good.   The waiter (i didnt get his name) was super friendly, joked with us, recommended food, told us how big the portions were so we could order correctly (which we didn't listen to but he tried). We had a bunch of kids with us and he even put the television back on and put Harry Potter on for them.   It is not in the best area but do not let that stop you, the food is legit.   I'm looking forward to my next trip there!",

    "text": "HOT HOT HOT! Real Mexican Food  NO fake watered down Americanized food here says the owner as he was helping me with my with my menu selection. I needed my hangover cure Mexicano style after a long night of remy martin and loud ass music.   First things first he could tell my wife and I were hurting offers a $5 Michelada. Serve it up please. He quickly comes back with Fresh Chips and Salsa. Chips were warm salsa was spicy a bit salty for me but good. The michelada is about the only item not on point served in a large glass cup, rimmed with the usual fruit salad salt, however there was no Ice or whatever remnants of ice were melted through. Not much mixed inside tasted like clamato and beer it was not terrible but Ive had and make way better thus -1 star. But Im here for the food so bring it on.   We wanted something cold and refreshing but also something hot and filling. The owner recommended their shrimp empanadas to start off. I ordered a plate of 3 $8. They were soooo good. Served super duper hot nice and crispy not oily, plenty of shrimp inside with pico de gallo and a wonderful green salsa on the side. This salsa was very good not salty just perfectly spicy and citrusy. I burned my mouth eating it, dont care love my food piping hot. These were very filling and big, Im already full WTH.   Next my wife ordered the large shrimp cocktail $12. Cocktail had plenty of shrimp, not like other restaurants that either have tiny shrimp you need a magnifying glass to see or 5 medium shrimp bobbing up and down with nothing but vegetables. This cocktail had tons of medium sized shrimp with just enough veggies and lots of avocado in the mix. The shrimp were soft to the bite, the juice was tasty enough salt and citrus flavors perfect for the hangover cure.   For my filling apetite I opted for the Camarones a la Diabla. Now for you hueros be careful when ordering this plate. The owner asked me, no warned me do you want the house style or medium level of heat the sauce comes with. I says man make them how you make them bro dont water em down for me \"este cabron thinks I cant handle it, im don chingon fool\" Alright you got it. My plate arrived everything fresh and piping hot. Lots of medium sized shrimp onions and bellpeppers served in a thick mole type broth with white rice, salad, and beans on the side $14. My first bite of the shrimp reminded me of my wifes home made mole recipe passed down from her grandma in Zacatecas not that mole u get in the jar. This Sauce was delicious, first bite I says good what the problem is, well u ever here of an afterburn and no Im not talking about working out. Shortly after swalling my mouth was on fire but even though it was on fire and could not be quenched by the michelada or my wifes cold coktail I immediately started to drink; I kept on eating it was too delicious. The owner came by several times \"te lo rebajo si quieres?\", I can reduce the heat for you if you want. Each time he passed my nose was running eyes were crying but I kept trucking on best camarones a la diabla  ever I had I told him. He says if they dont make your nose runny their not camarones al diabla.This is real mexican food just like my mother makes it. The white rice was delicious soft and not oily like most restaurants that serve orange rice. Beans, be careful sooo good, but that also means they may be cooked with lard so yes later you may have a gas issue. Although surprisingly I did not.   All in all good quality food, good service, great prices. Location is totally ghetto yo, downtown area 10-15 min drive from the strip but worth it. Located in a strip mall behind the TACOS MEXICO. We thought they were closed at 10:10am on Sunday but owner just opened up for us as we were leaving glad he did. The inside of the restaurant is clean, very small tastefully decorated with murals throughout. I will  try their ceviche and aguachiles next time Im in Vegas.",

I've never tried anything other than a \"typical\" ceviche so I'm not the best person to judge but it was amazing and will remember that I'll need to have at least one more person with me to finish it.

Maybe because we were the 2 youngest and my husband doesn't speak spanish, but from start to end this is one of the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  1st nobody greeted us, we were unsure if you sit yourself or wait for a hostess to seat us so we stood there for about 3 minutes looking like total idiots until we decided to take a seat ourselves. 2nd after they took our order the food took 27 minutes to come out (yes I counted because I was starving) and not once did they ask what we wanted to drink they just assumed we both wanted a water. 3rd I asked for some lemon after my plate arrived and I never got it and they never came back to ask if we were okay or needed anything else  It's 2017 so we only carry cards on us, but they and don't accept American Express and that's all we have. I asked the lady if they don't take it because of the fee it charges them and she quickly responds yes because of the fee. So I tell her to charge us extra if that's the case so we don't have to drive all the way back to our hotel on the strip which is a 25 minute drive from here, so she goes inside to ask her boss come out with the bullshit that they just don't have the machine for AE cards, BTW all machines take all cards but AE just happens to charge the most fees so they don't want to do it.  Now I'm sitting in the restaurant while my husband drives back to the hotel room go get a different method of payment lol  I'm all for supporting mom & pop restaurants like this one but this place sucks!! I would've been more satisfied and would've had better service at a McDonald's drive thru",

    "text": "This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. A sweet family runs it, with the son in the front of the house and mom in the kitchen.   To start, the chips and salsa are top notch. Something so simple can vary greatly, but the complexity of flavor in the salsa and the fresh crispy chips make these stand out as one of the better versions I've had.   The shrimp here are especially fresh, and the restaurant takes a lot of care in cleaning and preparing them. They may be small but they are plump and tasty. I recommend trying them in the Aguacaliente ceviche style (either chopped on a tostada or whole in the full appetizer version) or the Chipotle entree style.   Fajitas are hit or miss (once the veggies were overcooked with far too much oil), but they do come with a nice added touch of a little quesadilla on top. House specialties are done well, but I find myself coming back for the shrimp. All entrees are served with deliciously authentic beans.   For the value, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better Mexican seafood restaurant in town. I highly recommend Mariscos Playa Escondida!",

    "text": "My fellow Yelper Jessica and I wanted to have a last meal before I went under the knife. I wanted Mexican and she had this spot bookmarked. Plus, I love seafood.   Don't let the fact that it's in a slightly sketchy part of town and in a run down strip mall scare you off. They also close kinda early, but trust me it's so very worth it.   We decided we were going to split everything because everything on the menu sounded amazing.Of course we used our Yelp check-in offer of a free Horchata. Normally i'm not a big Horchata fan, but this was homemade and delicious. The chips and salsa set the tone of awesomeness right away. Ultimately we decided on starting with the Shrimp Empanadas. Next, Seafood Molcajetes and the A La Diabla Filete. The Shrimp Empanadas came out steaming hot, crisp and full of shrimp. You get three in an order and they are truly little pockets of goodness. When the Molcajete came out we were both shocked! They serve it in a heavy stone mortar that is super hot. It was filled to the brim with seafood, broth and completely covered in cheese!! It had crab legs, clams, shrimp and fish. The broth had a great spice to it. It was like nothing I've had before. It got even better when the La Diabla Filete came to the table. It's a whole deep fried fish (Yes, head, tail and all.) and they cover it in a spicy red sauce. This was excellent. The flavor of the sauce and the tender fish made a great combination. I could not stop myself from picking at it even after I was full. Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is super friendly as well. Even though we were still eating past closing they didn't try to rush us out at all. I love family owned businesses and this place has great charm all around.  If you love seafood and mexican food this is the place. I'm so thrilled to have been able to try it. I've been dreaming about that fish ever since. I can not wait to return!",

I have no problem with that, but on Saturday night they had a band in there and it was so loud we actually had to stop talking to each other.  It was on the level of a club!  I have no idea why a restaurant would take out a table on your busiest night and put a band in there.  I love live music, but this place is way to small for a band - way too small.  It actually made the dining experience unpleasant.  I had the combo ceviche - and that was awesome.  The ceviche was fresh and we devoured it!  Also had steak fajitas.  They were okay, the steak didn't seem to have much flavor, but it was still good.  Overall, the food was worthy of 4 stars but the music was just too much.  I mean people would like to talk to each other when they eat.  I would go back for lunch or something like that.",

My daughter had the Hawaiian bacon wrapped shrimp which she loved, and she's insanely picky. Overall excellent service and good. Only downside is that's is really small and crazy crowded.",

    "text": "Experience:  Still looking for a great Mexican restaurant and saw this had stellar reviews on YELP, and invited friends to come try lunch with me.    Facility: Do NOT be scared by the outside of this place. You step inside and feel very comfortable. It has about 12 tables and chairs, and the murals almost give it a Mexican Riviera feel.    Service:  I was greeted by Berto. He was very friendly and super helpful. He told me how it was a family business and his mother did all the cooking. He pointed out his cousin too. It started to get busy, but he managed the crowd well as the only server. He did seem to get a little caught up chatting at a young gal's table a few times.  ;)  Food: when you check in, you get a few Horchata, which is a cinnamon sweet rice drink...it was very good, but a tad sweet for me.  Since there were 6 of us, Berto suggested the giant mixed platter for 4. He said to substitute with a few appetizers, which we chose Shrimp Empanadas, and Ceviche at his suggestion.  The ceviche was a huge portion and was very delicious. The shrimp empanadas were good, but I filled up on one. Should have saved more room for the seafood platter.   The platter was amazing. There was plenty for 4 people...could have fed 6!  I liked everything I tasted on it. It had several kinds of shrimp, clams, crab legs, scallops, imitation crab, and fish. I think the fried fish was my favorite, but all of it was amazing!!!!!! Also, I have to give a shout out to the homemade corn tortillas, the tasty tortilla chips, the salsa, and the best was the green sauce on the side. We asked for a 5 out of 10 and it was nice and spicy, and had a great citrus flavor. I loved this sauce!!!  Overall:  now, this is my favorite Mexican place in Las Vegas. I will definitely be back.  Thanks for everything Berto!!!!",

Of course this food defeated us and we barely made a dent! Our bill was $70 not bad at all for mariscos. Give this place a try you will not be disappointed",

The prices are not bad at all either compared to other places I have been to.     They also have a variety of Mexican beverages including alcohol. Definitely recommend a michelada with any dish you order! My all time favorite dish here is camarones a la diabla. It's a very spicy shrimp dish that includes beans and rice. Hits the spot every time!     If you are looking for a great place for some Mexican food in Las Vegas I recommend this place before any other place!",

I went on yelped and saw there reviews so my husband and I came which let me say he's a little particular with food and he himself enjoyed it bery much! He had the camarones el Juan and fell in love with it. Shrimp with rice salad and fries. Sauce on the shrimp was tangy and sweet. With a flavor of spicy mayo. We also had shrimp tacos and they gave us to try agauchile with a new flavor to it which was AMAZING! Something new they added to there menu or will ( AGUACHILE EN NEGRO). The place was very clean aswell. All in all very happy with this place and will be back and recommend!",

Not the best I've ever had but good. The oysters and ceviche that came with the drinks were extremely spicy. If your not use to spicy food get the regular michelada. It has shrimp inside.  We ordered a mojarra which was huge and good. We ordered shrimp cocktail the small one it was all right. Not a lot of flavor but Ok. Shrimp were heka tiny but plenty. Ordered the stuffed shrimp with bacon. The shrimp were scrumptious and yum. Rice and beans were bland. Unfortunately we entered the restroom until after we ate and it was so gross ugh. Made me feel sick to my stomach. Overall service was okay. Not the best but the lady was nice.",

A lot of shrimp in the coctel.  Their customer service was great! All the ladies are very sweet and helpful when not too sure what to order. We will definitely be back whenever we visit Vegas.

The ceviche was so good and the micheladas that extra touch. They have fancy options that have shrimp and cucumber hanging off the side and oysters inside or around the bottom of your michelada. The decorations are very cute inside as well.  So naturally, the next time I was in Vegas I felt like I needed to go back to this amazing place! However, this second time wasn't quite as special. Don't get me wrong the ceviche and oysters were still absolutely delicious. But maybe I went on a day where their shipment of fish wasn't quite as fresh because Escondido went from being the best ceviche I've ever had to just my top 5! If you are near, definitely check it out!",

According to the excellent waitress this restaurant has been open for 6 months and they are currently working on there liquor license. I can't wait to come back when they offer Micheladas!  I Definitely recommend this delicious, fresh food!",

    "text": "From LA but in Vegas and craving Mariscos for my birthday. I'm really picky when it comes to Mariscos however I came to the right place! Food: Regular Michelads were spot on, great mix. It's their homemade mix, delicious. To start we had shrimp tecolotes, shrimp in a spicy sauce, great favor and not to spicy. You could chose whatever level of spiciness you want. We tried level 2 (bcuz we had some people that don't like spicy) still delicious. Oysters preparados, imagine oysters with a seafood mix on top. This were good if you add lemon, salt and tapatio. Only had 1/2 dozen and believe me they were topped with plenty seafood mix. Husband had a mojarra frita (fried fish) he loved it. Friend had shrimp enmantecados (buttered shrimp) similar to shrimp scampi. This shrimp were cooked in butter with onions. Delicious. And I saved the best for last Pescado Zarandeado (grilled fish) this is the best I've had! Once cooked it's covered with a sauce and grilled onions. It's ordered by the pound. My plate was 2 lbs because I thought I was going to share. Lol I was so good I ate it all!!!  Atmosphere: the restaurant is small. It was half full so we didn't have to wait to be seated. You could tell they have a lot of regular costumers because on more than one occasion I heard staff calling customers by name. Very friendly environment even the customers are friendly we had great conversations with customers.  Staff were very nice and attentive. Overall a great experience and will definitely will recommend it and will be back whenever we go to Vegas.",

    "text": "Came here after a long night and was super hungry lol so we ordered everything! The Yelp check in sucks by the way! We checked in for our free coronita (you have to order like $12 worth of items to receive the mini beer) BUT it's not good for weekend or holidays? Wth is that? Lol total joke and I was upset with that, I mean cmon it's Vegas and most ppl go out to eat on weekends so why even have it if it's practically not available? The drink you see pictured was just okay, it looked way better than it tasted for $15 it just didn't cut it. I forgot what it was called but it was the more expensive of the michelada drinks with the seafood stuff all around it. I mean the actual drink portion was pretty good but the seafood that came with it, shrimp, fish and oyster tasted very fishy like they were a little old. I wasn't impressed. I ordered 2 tostadas de camarron and  they were pretty good & they're really big so one is plenty! My honey ordered the cocktail and  aguachiles, it was all just ehhh ok. Again all the seafood just didn't taste fresh like I was craving. We ordered a side of fries and beans (for dipping lol don't judge) and to be honest THAT was the best part of our meal. Not worth the $60 we paid but hey maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. The other tables' orders looked amazing so definitely try the grilled section cause that looked delicious. I'll be back to try the other stuff but just maybe shy away from these items. The place is cute and clean and the service is great! Will try again.",

Thank you!!!!!  Now on to the drinks... BEST EVER!!!!!  I've never had a Smirnoff the way they are served here. Chamoy and chile powder mixed with who knows what else! Delicious!!!

I came in about 5 minutes after they had closed but the owner ( I think) saw us and asked us if we still wanted to come inside.  They allowed us to order and eat our food without being pressured even after they where closed.  This alone sold me on this place and I come here every time I visit Vegas.   The food is delicious and surprisingly affordable.  I always get a Mangoneada michellada with my food and I recommend one to anyone who comes to this place because they are amazing.  I normally get the Mojarra Frita and a shrimp ceviche tostada and I have yet to be disappointed.  One thing that is on the bad side (kinda) is the place is small and there are only a few tables.  But I have yet to be there and it be really crowded.",

Luckily we did and had one of the best meals we've had in a long time. I don't give tons of reviews and most if not all are 5, but we go tons of places.

When I saw all of these five-star reviews for a new place I'd never heard of, I made a beeline to check them out that very day.   SHRIMP EMPANADAS: Got an order of 3, just as good as everyone else says. Empanadas are perfectly cooked without being oily, and the filling is just the right amount with a slight kick of spice and they don't skimp on the shrimp.  MARLIN TACO: Be still my heart! I fell in love with marlin tacos on a recent trip to San Diego and can't get enough of them since. A small taco, for $3.50, with cheese, several avocado slices, and perfectly roasted marlin. So good I almost ordered a few more to-go.  AGUACATE RELLENO: Special of the day, a ceviche-stuffed avocado. Each 'cado half was overflowing, and there was a pile more on the plate. I don't think I've ever had more ceviche for $12, and the avocado was huge. Plating was beautiful, with a rim of cucumber slices serving a functional and decorative purpose.  Personable service, plentiful portions, and good prices for high-quality Mexican seafood. This isn't your average taco shack, this place is SO much more! **Free horchata with Yelp check-in!**",

It was spicey and so good; but maybe they could have done a better job deveining the shrimp.  We also had the molcajete mixto. It included hrilled chicken, carne asada and shrimp with cheese and grilled cacti. It was very delicious.  I liked that the meat didn't have a lot of fat. It came with beans and warm tortillas. I'm not sure if the corn tortillas were hand made,  but they sure tasted super good.  They have liquor,  but we had horchata and jamaica. I prefer the jamaica. Horchata was good but a bit milky for my taste. So yes,  this is our spot for Vegas. When in Vegas,  I will definitely come back.",

If you get a chance to go you won't regret it.

Was a little weary cause it only had 10 reviews.. thinking all the family and friends posted to increase its Rating.. but actually this place is 4 stars and awesome service.       Don't let the outside deter you from this place, yeah its hole in wall, but inside was warming and clean. The owner/manager was very friendly and attentive. The food was good to pretty good... depending what you get. I had a shrimp cocktail, and shrimps wrapped bacon on the side, my new wifey had two tostadas de cerviche which were loaded w/ tons of cerviche, Pricing was reasonable, tad bit more expensive than one I go to in Cali.. but cheaper than anything of mariscos u would find on the strip.        At conclusion of our meal, Owner/Manager thanked us and even offered deep fried ice cream for us for FREE!  We said no at first.. but decided sure why not.. not a lot of things FREE in life...  and yes it was EXCELLENT!!  Caramel/Chocolate drizzled on top, w/ crispy corn thin strips..   We'll be coming back again.  Wish I would have taken pics but we scarfed out food down pretty fast.",

Pescado ceviche was delicious. The marlin tacos were like nothing I've ever had before. But the dish that had our whole table trippin was the pinaviche. Do not sleep. Be like Vincent and order one for the table. You'll be a legend, like Vinny.",

The inside is kind of small but I really like the day of the dead decor painted on the walls.  They also had karaoke going on and the few ladies that got up to sing had very pleasant voices.  It was rather enjoyable to listen to them sing as we ate and talked.  My friend suggested this restaurant based on all the positive reviews and they were not wrong.  The service was good and the food was really good too.  They had homemade flour and corn tortillas yum! I had the shrimp ceviche and the shrimp empanadas both were delicious. I also had a bucket okay so it was just a rather large cup of Horchata that tasted great, it was not grainy or bland.   One of my friends had the Ajuillo shrimp and she loved it my other friend had the prepared oysters and shrimp in a creamy garlic butter sauce  her favorite was the shrimp in the creamy garlic butter sauce with the homemade flour tortillas (that she did not share the flour tortillas! Lol) She did let us try a shrimp it was delicious.",

The Mariscos tower was $25.99 and when I complained to the person in charge he told me it was too late to get it exchanged or get a discount. Stay away from this place! (To the owner) maybe if the servers would come around I would've said something earlier. Crappy service and that tower was disgusting, I didn't have a problem with the other food so no nobody was being cheap. Ur plate was just disgusting and you can tell from the picture I barely touched it. Hopefully this review keeps people away from your restaurant and show the type of owner you are!",

    "text": "We were looking for a marisco spot since family came to town. Since I don't eat mariscos, I decided to check on yelp and found this little gem. I was a little bit scared to tell you the truth. It's in a sketchy area BUT we decided to go through and check it out.   Our server (which she was AWESOME!!) took her time with us. She brought us chips (which were pretty stale) and salsa (which was spicy but tasted like it was hechado a perder). I ordered a mango margarita which was pretty good, my husband and uncle ordered a \"Buen Dia\" michelada which they LOVED and my aunt ordered agua de mango.   On to the food...I ordered fajitas de carne. It was seriously DELICIOUS! The fajitas had the perfect sazon! I wasn't a big fan of the rice or beans because most of the time it doesn't matter what restaurant I go to, they never get it right. So I didn't have high expectation on that. My husband ordered \"Vuelve a la vida.\" I honestly don't know what it had but he said he liked it. I'm guessing it was shrimp, oysters and imitation crab. My uncle ordered shrimp cocktail. He was pleased and surprised that they filled it up with a lot of shrimp. Most of the time at some restaurants they usually get real cheap with adding more shrimp on their cocktails. My tia had flautas which she said was pretty good.   All in all the service was fantastic! They just need to keep an eye on their chips and salsa. Stale chips and spoiled salsa isn't fun to eat.",

Which you can order with some type of spicy tangy sauce. (He even warned me that the sauce was made with mustard just to make sure that I was okay with it.)   As far as pricing, I felt like it was affordable. I got a whole fish with avocado, grilled onions, a salad, rice, beans for 9$ Hubby ordered fajitas which also came with salad, rice, and beans. For drinks we went with a large and small horchata and checked in with yelp for a free small Jamaica. Overall, we spent $26.  Lots of options on the menu, Would definitely return to try other dishes.",

Mariscos Playa Escondida is truly a gem and if you're ever in Vegas or passing by it, it's definitely worth the stop. I had the Molcajete con Mariscos. It was delicious, very wide selection of seafood on the molcajete and it's topped off with a nice layer of cheese. My girlfriend had Agua Chiles and I tried out some from her plate and it was probably the best Agua Chiles I have EVER had. Service is great and the staff here is very friendly. Definitely recommend it! 5***** next time I come to Vegas this will be my first place to come stop by.",

Chips and salsa were delicious (I feel this is always a good indicator how the food will taste at a Mexican restaurant). I ordered the Aguachiles and wow was it good. Limey, salty and spicy! I also had a michelada and must say it was one of the best I've ever had. Finished off the meal with a horchata (best I've had before-- home-made) and the fried ice cream was very good, too!

There ceviche is amazing even though they make it the same day instead of marinating it over night in limon. This will make the ceviche a little little raw but if you don't like that they will make the ceviche with the boiled shrimp. Like I mentioned before they give great service here!

The Buendia is a Michelada with camarones and pepinos around the rim and an oyster in the middle. I got the camarones al mojo de ajo and my boyfriend got the camarones al la diabla with tortillas de mais. The tortillas were hecho a mano and sooo good. Definatelt recommend stopping by this place if you have the chance. We also got the empanadas de pollo which were also goo. 2 micheladas, 1 Buendia, 3 empanadas, camarones al mojo de ajo, & camarones a la diabla all for under $60. Defiantly a gem & a good find. The customer service was fantastic as well.",

Regrettably, the oysters were a bit gritty and stuck inside the shell making it not so sexy to devour during date.   *Camarones al la diabla was a simple and safe Pescatarian choice. The menu has a variety of items but my Spanish is pretty non existent so I opted for items with pictures. The shrimp was pretty bland. No bold hidden flavors.

I really didn't like that the bathrooms were in front of some tables. The prices were great. The staff was very friendly. My food came out fast and it was very tasty. I ordered two carnitas tacos and I wasn't too happy with, the meat was super chunky and the onions in the taco where poorly diced, I mean they were huge, I also orders ceviche and that was amazing. I did have to ask my server for silverware and napkins.  One thing that I absolutely did not like was seeing two different females that were both servers go into the bathroom with their aprons on. I was shocked to see that. Very unsanitary and gross. After witnessing that I had lost my appetite. I was more than half way done with my food, that just really left a bad taste in my mouth, especially given that fact that also work in the food industry. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was a 5 out of 10.",

    "text": "Going off the overall emotional and visceral reaction, I'd give it the highest rating on this little scale of ours. After taking an objective approach and considering some of the flaws, I think four stars will more than suffice.  Mariscos Playa Escondida is literally a \"hidden\" gem, or hidden beach if you know enough Spanish to translate its name. It's in a nondescript strip mall on the northeast corner of Maryland and Charleston, and most visitors definitely would grant it hole-in-the-wall status if they should dare to venture to this slightly sketchier area of town. My friends and I have been doing dinner on Thursday nights recently and our chooser of the week served up this highly-rated and surprisingly not-very-busy spot.  We started off with heretofore unfamiliar beer \"cocktails\" from their drinks menu, specifically the Preparadas section. These reminded me of Bloody Marys, but I don't like Bloody Marys; in contrast, I actually enjoyed my Buen Dia ($7.50), a tall pint of your choice of beer mixed with tomato juice and other ingredients, along with a lone fresh oyster at the bottom and garnishes of shrimp and cucumber slices. There was an overall salty character and the bitterness of the beer was drowned out.  One of my friends got an Aterdecer ($9.50), which is another Preparada and has what were described as spicy oysters... yeah, riiight. A more apt description would be napalm oysters. I ended up with the 3rd and final oyster after he gamely took down two, and I learned why he was so eager to offer it up. It set my tongue on fire and kept it ablaze for several minutes. If you're into that kind of thing, then this is what you want. If not, then stay the burning heck away.  Complimentary tortilla chips and relatively medium tomato-based salsa were provided. The chips come out warm and crunchy and the salsa was the typical accompaniment. Another good option is guacamole ($3 for a small, $6 for a large), and our small bowl was shared among four people just fine (disclaimer: we had already eaten some snacks, enjoyed some relatively filling drinks, and been victimized by palate-numbing bites). It was a good guacamole, and it contained tomatoes but didn't taste much if at all of lime.  I was my typical indecisive self when it came time to pick an entree, but following the employee's guided questions and eventual suggestion, I grabbed the individual-sized portion of the Parillada de Mariscos ($21.99, includes 3 tortillas; unsure of English translation ), which is a grilled mixed seafood plate. Shrimp, real crab, fake crab, bay scallops, diced octopus, fish, and even abalone were all present on a metal and wood plate. This is not a sauced dish, but they must have used a great dry rub before grilling. All of the proteins were delicious, and the Mexican green onion garnish was surprisingly intriguing. The sides of not-so-plain white rice, refried beans (with some cheese), and salad were also tasty and useful (more on this shortly).  Alas, I couldn't overlook some of my observations. Most notably, the salt variation was too much; the cut of fish was underseasoned, whereas most of the rest of the items veered toward the high end of the salty scale. Yes, liberal usage of the sides and the tortillas helps, but it becomes too much eventually. I loved the thickest parts of the crab legs and the claw, but the exposed and thinner parts of the crab legs ended up falling apart and becoming too dry. Smaller bits of seafood didn't come out perfectly either. On that note, they really could've utilized larger shrimp. Those can't be that much more expensive and simply have higher potential.  My favorite bite of the night was actually the namesake of a friend's Carnitas plate. What a marvelously fatty and tender bite of pork that was! I also liked the savory broth in the cheese-topped Seafood Molcajete and the more briny broth of a seafood soup enough that I would consider trying those on a return visit after I get some of those carnitas.  I didn't pay that much attention to the costs of my friends' entrees, but they were lower in price than mine. Two of them also didn't have to worry; as a result of not-having-awful-luck, I won a credit card roulette game (in other words, the host/server chose his card out of a random draw) and resultingly wasn't on the hook for any of what we got. I think the victim had actually proposed this draw, so big props to him for tonight.  Mariscos Playa Escondida isn't perfect, but it's well worth your while if you want great Mexican seafood, with at least one awesome terrestrial meat to boot. I will strive to return for carnitas and for further menu exploration.",

    "text": "This place was hard to find and was located in a small shopping center. The front of the restaurant looked sketchy and we were starting to rethink whether or not we wanted to go here.   We went inside and there was a wait. Of course there was a wait, the restaurant is so small (12 tables for parties of 4). The wait wasn't too bad; we probably waited only 15 minutes. The restaurant was decorated for Dia de los Muertos and had cool painting on the wall.   The service was all over the place. Each waiter who came to our table was different. It was unorganized and we received our food and drinks after the tables around us who ordered after us. And it took them about 20 minutes after we were seated to get us chips and salsa. By the time we got our food we were almost done with our drinks.   The drinks were not amazing but the pictures of the drinks looked amazing. My mother and girlfriend ordered micheladas. They weren't great and had a lot of salt. I ordered the Smirnoff Mangoneada; it didn't have a lot of alcohol and tasted like cherry kool-aid with chamoy but I loved the tamarind spoon that came with it.   The food... just know our stomachs were churning after we left. We ordered the ostinones preparado, empanadas de camarones, and torre de mariscos. We love seafood and were excited about what we ordered. But the food didn't taste fresh and the torre de mariscos had no flavor. It would probably be better if they poured the lemon juice over the tower of seafood. The oysters were the only good dish we ordered. The empanadas were not good and a bit plain (no flavor).   The restaurant decor was cool but the food and service were below average. I thought because of the line we waited in and all tables being full meant that this place was great. I will not be back because our stomachs were messed up that day and the next.",

    "text": "A friend recommended Mariscos Playa Escondida and boy did it win us over. This Mexican restaurant specializing in seafood was completely off my radar. It's located on East Charleston near Maryland Pkwy in a stripmall tucked behind Tacos Mexico. It could easily be missed if you weren't specifically looking for it. It's a True hole in wall, but let me tell you it is a gem!   This was an experience equal to those we've had off the beaten path in the Riveria Maya. No flight or passports required. It's hard to believe they can achieve these flavors and create this delicious seafood in the middle of the desert. But they do it.   We let our friendly server guide us with our order. He recommended the aguachile tostada and the shrimp empanadas. We had to have both. The empanadas were too hot to handle from the fryer so we let those cool, while we dug into the aguachile. They offer spicy dishes on a scale of 1-10, we ordered an 8 for everything. There was no False advertisement everything had a nice kick just the way we like it. The aguachile is diced shrimp marinated in chiles and lime. If you like ceviche, you'll love this. We gobbled it up between bites of the house salsa and chips.   The empanadas are the best I've had outside Ecuador. These were filled with tender shrimp, onions, tomatoes and garlic. Damn tasty! I'd go for some now, if they were only open on Mondays. Definitely a must a try! We had three for $8.   I was easily swayed on the whole snapper ($9/lb) its topped with spicy cream sauce, onions, jalapenos and avocado, and served with rice, beans and handmade tortillas. I prefer the corn to the flour. I've enjoyed snapper half a dozen ways but snapper tacos were a first; they did not disappoint. A two pound fish left plenty to share with the husband.  He ordered the appetizer of the el tecolote shrimp per our servers suggestion. He warned that it was a lot of work, but definitely worth the effort. He was right. The flavor was fantastic.   They have a nice variety of Cerveza ($3.50). We had five Victorias between us and a few pounds of seafood for $75. It was a steal and a real treat!",

Berto, the only wait staff (at the time we were there) was attentive, funny & helpful.  5 stars for the wonderful service.    Was disappointed that they did not serve top shell margaritas but we had their Bud Lite margaritas served in a mason jar, came in lime/strawberry/mango flavors.  We had one of each and they were good and pretty strong.    Our meal was good.  Started with their Campechana (shrimp/octopus cocktail) and it was excellent and shrimp was plentiful.  I had their snapper deep fried served with an onion jalapeno spicy sauce.  Mind you, I like spicy and this was spicy!  I asked for fresh sliced jalapenos on the side and didn't even need it!  Mom had carne asada and the beef came out too dry, comes with grilled cactus and jalapeno. Sis had their shrimp enchiladas and said it was very good.    You get a free horchata with check in.   Had no idea what it is and Berto came back with a sample.  His description was pretty accurate, \"left over milk from cinnamon toast crunch cereal\".  We were too stuffed to take advantage of it but it was good.  Overall a good experience!",

It's a little hole in the wall in a shopping center that you would not notice it was there. We walked in and got seated and were brought out chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and crispy and salsa was delicious and spicy. We all ordered and I had a shrimp cocktail and a ceviche tostada de pescado. It took a while for our food to arrive because we were a table of 9. To start we also had agua chiles that were fresh and spicy and enjoyable. My michelada was very good and hit the spot. A little spicy but not to much and nice salty rim to compliment the beer. It was a good experience and the staff was very friendly and always asking if we were ok. If you want seafood off the strip take a drive and see what you think.",

We usually go to Lindo Michoacan restaurant when we are on our bimonthly treks to Vegas but it was closed for holiday.....with four starving adults now highly upset we looked on yelp and found even better food than the good food at the large lovely Lindo Michoacan. The food here is authentic Mexican seafood at its finest. Shrimp cocktail yum. Red and green burrito mojado delicious. Camaron all mojo de ajo the best I ever had and great hard tacos and flautas with very flavorful rice and beans. Best horchata ever. The restaurant is small but cute and clean and excellent service...oh did I forget the fantastic spicy salsa n chips. Bargain prices too all four adults entrees and a giant shrimp cocktail bill was $66. We may never go back to Lindo Michoacan...I want more shrimp....",

Thought I should bring my mom here since we both enjoy seafood and Mexican food. Usually we'll go to the Islitas restaurant for seafood, but I saw the reviews here thought we should give it a shot.   First it's located in a sketchy area. It's noted it opens at 10:30, but it was locked they didn't open till 11. The other stores around there are kinda old and beat. As you walk in it's pretty small the waitress quickly attended us. My mom order a coke bottle they didn't have it, my first choice was a tamarind flavored jarritos soda turns out they didn't have that lol. The oysters we ordered had this water flavor instead of the normal oyster flavor. The shrimp cocktail I had was good had a lot of shrimp. My mom had the carne molcajete which comes with chicken, beef, chorizo, cheese, beans, and grilled cactus. She said it ok but the beef and chicken were so seasoned it came out salty.",

    "text": "With a 5 star review on yelp, I thought it must be real good seafood... Eh.  I was looking for something comparable to las Islitas with out the high price tag and, playa popped up. Small yet clean little place. Very attentive server and prompt. I got the shrimp a la diabla, shrimp mojo de ajo, ostiones preparados, langostina, and shrimp al vapor..(I came with a party of 4).  Shrimp a la diabla (spicy shrimp)- spicy but bleh flavor, garlicky rice was ok, lettuce on the side was just a waste of lettuce, but I really enjoyed the beans bc it had pieces of chicharron.. Atleast I hope that's what it was. Mojo de ajo shrimp (garlic butter shrimp) tasted more of onions than garlic. Definitely not memorable.  Shrimp al vapor (steamed shrimp) was nicely seasoned but was almost too sweet for my taste, due to all the bell peppers.  Langostinas (langoustines)- nice spicy sauce, but only came with 3 langoustines. There was hardly any meat in them which made that dish disappointing.  Ostiones preparados (prepared oysters with a shrimp salad on top)-were ok, but you can tell the oysters weren't fresh. I'm used to the ones sold at \"las Islitas\" so I might've had my hopes too high. The shrimp salad needed more lemon and some salt and maybe a nice sauce to top it off.   All in all, the place was nice and clean and service was friendly and prompt. Food was ok, but not worth the 5 yelp stars in my opinion. The prices are fair, but I think this would be my first and last visit since it didn't wow me. I think I'll stick with las Islitas whenever I'm in the mood for oysters and shrimp.",

When we came in we were offered a side of salsa and chips and they were really good not one of those basic slightly spicy sauces.  This one was homemade and kicking with spice.   This salsa caused me to fear for my dish but I still went for a 8 for my Aguachiles and I thought it was just perfect for me. Boy was it delicious but I'll have to skip out on it next time because it was on the pricier side for me compared to my boyfriends dish that I couldn't stop stealing..  The dish I tried to was called along the line of pulpo playa escondido and it was so delicious that I wish I had gotten it as my dish instead of the aguachiles because it was also 6 dollars cheaper than my own dish the aquachiles.    We saw the raving review on the guacamole so I thought it was a great opportunity to give it a try the 3 dollar was a decent size and delicious it something I would try again.  Until next time because there will be a next time.",

    "text": "An Absolute Bargain for what you get!  My five-star review is based on the food and the service; not the location. As others have mentioned, the place is *very* small and not fancy. Tables are packed in tight. It is very much a family scene here, so it can get a little loud and a little *close*.  That being said; the excellent food is worth the trip to this \"transitional\" (i.e. slightly scuzzy) mall area.   I ordered 3 tacos (Tubbz (shrimp), Gobernador (also shrimp), & Marlin) with sides of Rice & Beans. Each was delicious, but the Marlin was *amazing* with lots of smoked paprika giving it a rich, smokey flavor. I will order a complete Marlin meal next time.   I'm not usually a fan of \"crispy\" taco shells, as they are often pre-made and stale. Not here! The Tubbz taco was Fresh, flakey, and crunchy. A real treat!  The boyfriend ordered Mojarras (tilapia) \"Al Mojo de Ajo\" which was truly out-of-this-world fantastic! The whole fried fish was served in a rich, pungent, swoon-worthy garlic sauce. The fish was done to perfection, not over or undercooked. When he realized how much of the sauce had dripped through the fish onto the plate, he scraped his rice into it so as not to miss a drop. Yeah - that good.  Given that we were the only White dudes in the place at the time (an excellent sign, in my opinion) I was surprised to see that the menu was in English. I'm stupid. They have menus in English AND in Spanish. The server just made an obvious and smart choice. Much appreciated.  For two LARGE seafood meals with beer, the grand total was about $40. Seriously. This would have been double that anywhere near the Strip.  We will return!",

My usual plate ordered is Agua Chiles. This place has just been awarded \"The Best Agua Chiles in the west past\" I'm sure I could also claim in the world but I have not been everywhere. If you come visit Las Vegas this is a must place to come eat. Order anything it is all Great I even ordered to go for later that night. Needless to say there were no leftovers.

    "text": "I really came in here with optimism seeing the high ratings, but sadly this was another dodge at Mexican food for me.   Maybe we came in on the good cook's day off, but I doubt it and will not return to find out.  The place was packed so I thought that's got to be a good sign, right? But no, the place is just really small.   The next big test would be the chips and salsa, and unfortunately bottled salsa and stale chips are not a good impression on what's to follow.  We tried to order the yelp check in offer of a free Horchata, but our server said this was only good during the week, so our  impatient server said he'd be back and we continued to search the menu.   A different server dropped off two large Horchatas and so I thought wow we didn't really put in our order, but thought oh well they're here now, and I then asked if these were the small or large drinks, and she said \"large, because there are no refills\"  WoW!  I didn't think the first server even took our drink order and then to find out we didn't have a choice of small or large really did not impress me further.  The Horchata was clearly just rice water with a little sugar and cinnamon, not good at all!  On to our appetizer and entrees.  We ordered a half a dozen of oysters that were prepared with pulpo (octopus) and crab ceviche type of thing.   They were very bland with no taste of seafood whatsoever and the crab of course was imitation crab these were served with some kind of  runoff liquid, gross.  At this point I was not looking forward to the rest of our orders, but they came out before I could finish with my thoughts.  I had the bandera burrito which came with carne asada, chorizo rice and beans, covered in some red and green tasteless sauce.  The chorizo totally overpowered the carne asada taste or anything else inside the burrito and was just not good at all.   My husband ordered some kind of shrimp dish which had six or seven overcooked shrimp all shriveled up buried under sauteed onions, accompanied by bland rice and overly refried beans.    The food was not good by any means, and to top it off there was a two man band playing nice music but way to loud for such a small establishment.   Hole in the wall places like these normally are the best type of eateries but this one unfortunately for me was a wasted hole in a wall and could stay a playa escondida (hidden beach). The best part was the company, (thanks Norm and Nels) but as far as the food here, nothing I would ever want to try twice, in fact I wish I could take this one back.",

Everything was delicious and full of flavor. The servings were big enough to share with the table and the prices were decent. Don't let the wait scare you it is worth it.

    "text": "HOLY MOLY. Talk about diamond in the rough. Do you know how difficult it is to find a good Mexican food joint? Found this little spot in a tiny corner behind Tacos Mexico. It's hella small inside, with maybe 5 to 6 tables, prob won't fit more than 25 people. We were met with friendly smiling servers who were attentive and accommodating through out our meal. For starters, I must say the have probably THE BEST CHIPS AND SALSA I've ever had, True authentic flavors with a Spicy slap in the face- so beware if you can't handle the heat too well. We thought it best to get a bunch of side items instead of the combo plates which was a great idea.   Must have: Shrimp Empanadas.   The seafood molcajete was unbelievable! Comes served in a hot stone bowl, shrimp, clam, nopales(cactus), green peppers, onions, cheese. This is enough for two people to share. I recommend ordering a side of rice to pour the food on, rather than eating w tortillas.. Be sure to order an extra set of plates.   Also tried a ceviche tostada, which is also enough to be shared by two people. The rice and beans are delicious too! Tasty alcoholic drinks are available, such as Micheladas.   The menu is varied so Definitely coming back again!",

I ordered the mariscos molcajete.  It comes out sizzling hot in, it is also super hot to the touch so be careful!  They also bring hand made corn tortillas.  There is a thick layer of delicious white cheese, once you poke trough, you reach the delectable broth and perfectly cooked and seasoned seafood such as shrimp, octupus, scallops, crab leg, crab meat, clam.  It also has onions and bell peppers adding to the perfectly crafted flavor.      They bring out a plate with white rice, beans and lettuce.

Order: apps: Aguachiles, oysters preparado. Entree: I get the mariscos molcajete and wife gets the fried catfish with pico de gallo. HOLY CRAP!! Everything was off the hook. Bold, in your face flavors, incredibly fresh and authentic. The Aguachiles, ceviche style shrimp in a spicy lime chile sauce, was mouth watering and perfectly spicy at a 5 out of 10. The oysters were topped with a generous pile of ceviche mixto with a great hot sauce and even under all that you could still taste the creamy, briny oyster. My molcajete was huge and the sauce is so balanced and deep in flavor. The catfish was PERFECTLY fried and was juicy and tender. Washed it all down with a free horchata for checking in.   This is serious Mexican seafood, and could command a much greater price, but it's location and family oriented style makes it affordable and outstanding. Truly a gem on the Vegas casual dining scene. GO NOW!!",

    "text": "Been here a few times now (sad to say, I live in the neighborhood which so many refer to as \"the ghetto\"). Service has always been fast and friendly, and the shrimp empanadas are a must-  piping hot and tasty, if a little spendy at $7.50 for an order of three.  They have some meat and chicken dishes, but you really want to stick with the seafood. (Mole was on the menu, but they never seemed to have it. Noticed they finally went ahead and crossed it off).  And speaking of the menu, it's one of those kinds with pictures of everything, A practice perhaps frowned upon in finer dining circles, but it sure do come in handy when venturing into unfamiliar territory like actual Mexican food that doesn't come in a bag with a picture of a bell on it.  My favorite new (to me) thing I tried was the deep fried whole tilapia, which comes with your choice of sauce. The skin was brown and crispy to the point of crunchy, with moist, white meat that you ferret out whilst on a treasure hunt of its little dead carcass. Yum! The Anaconda seemed alarmed by the french-fried face staring up at us, but I was undeterred. He opted for the red, white, and green burrito, which was almost too much food, even for him. Note I said almost.  Service has always been friendly and attentive, even when they're busy. I haven't encountered the dreaded live music yet, but the space is very small so can't imagine that it wouldn't be annoying even without amplifiers.  All the food we've tried has been really good. They do garnish the plate with the ubiquitous and inexplicable undressed lettuce leaves called \"salad\", and the chips are just okay and the salsa is too hot for my taste. Wish they offered a milder option, especially since the soda comes in cans, meaning no refills when lots of cold liquids are mandatory.",

I've always had one spot that I always visit for food while I am visiting Vegas and now this place is going to be my new spot.   This place is little bit off the strip and is little hard to find because it is wedged between these small random shops. Seating is limited due to space, and so is the parking.   Other than what I've mentioned above... Their food is freaking amazing!!! If you are in Vegas, this place is a must! Their salsa is phenomenal! Their michelada is on point! I also had shrimper cooked in lemon and chile (i really don't know what it is called, sorry), shrimp empenada, and some bowl that had carne asada, spicy chorizo, cheese, cactus, and onions... So damn good!! Doesn't even matter what they are called! They are freaking delicious!   I will be looking forward to my next trio to Vegas so I can go back to this place.",

We ordered the shrimp cocktails and one with octopus. Great size for the price. Tried one of the shrimp empanadas, and the green sauce was very good. The empanada was a little oilier than I like, but it was full of flavor. Had the California carne asada burrito, and that thing was huge!

We had the oysters with ceviche on top which were very fresh and tasty. The 7mares was also very delicious and the aguachiles  tostada was to die for. If your ever in vegas and in the mood for seafood....definitely check this place out. :)",

Someone in our group was craving shrimp, so I did what anyone would do...I opened the yelp app lol I found this place to be less than 10 minutes from the strip with a rating above 4.5 so we decided to give it a try. We had trouble finding it but it's located in the shopping center behind Autozone, tucked away in the corner. A real small hole in the wall type of restaurant.  We were greeted and served immediately upon coming in. The menu had something for everyone, including non-seafood eaters. The prices were not cheap, but it's Vegas. Back home, at 18 bucks a place you're at a decent sit down restaurant - definitely not a hole in the wall.   Now the meal, absolutely delicious. We ordered the camarones aguachiles as an appetizer and they were spot on. I crave them just thinking about them. The molcajete was great, the pescado sarandeado was good, and the shrimp cocktail was delicious also. Basically, you can't go wrong ordering anything off the menu.   Oh, and the horchata and jamaica drinks are home made!   We will be coming back on every Vegas visit for sure!",

I was definitely impressed. Decor is kind of cheesy. Plastic birds, lots of mirrors, blue paint. It seemed like you'd find this place close to the ocean rather than in a desert like Vegas, which is good since this is a seafood place.  The owner/waiter was really nice, he recommended the shrimp and said the spicy style was really good, but I wasn't feeling like hurting my belly for the sake of taste so I opted for the garlic one. It was really good. Came with rice, beans, salad and tortillas. I thought the main course was great. Fresh, smelled good, and looked appetizing. I will definitely come back and try something new.  Only thing I'll dock them for is not so great chips, but heck, can't complain about the free appetizer so still 5 stars. Here's to my first review of hopefully many. Luckily, I'm not a jaded reviewer just quite yet so I'll probably just be reviewing places I like.",

I would actually give them 3 1/2 stars....  The ceviche tostada was heavenly and generously portioned with ceviche cascading onto the plate. I could have eaten 5 of them, lol. They had a ceviche appetizer plate but it was almost $20 and I'm kind of a cheapskate. I ordered the seafood molcajate and I guess I didn't realize that it was nothing like the pollo/carne/shrimp version because mine was served like a seafood stew. It was decent but certainly not what I thought I was ordering. My hubs got a shrimp dish that was good but a little small in my opinion.   Now the shrimp cocktail that everyone has raved about was a huge disappointed. There were plenty of shrimp but the \"cocktail\" was nothing more than tomato juice with no seasoning and no flavor. I emptied almost half the bottle of Tapatio into it just to give it some flavor. Oh well....   The salsa was amazing and the perfect amount of spice for me. I think most people would think it was too spicy.",

    "text": "\"Five Stars? You Kidding Me Right???\"  Packed locals' restaurant tucked away in the corner of the Charland Plaza on E Charleston and Maryland Parkway, this tiny hole in the wall has received rave reviews and maintained a 5-star rating. That was enough to persuade us to see what it was all about. Live music goin' on, everyone seemed to be enjoying the food and a pretty extensive menu too.   We decided to start off with some Ostiones Preparadas and a couple of popular items suggested by the employees, The Shrimp Tecolote and Carne Asada Burrito. We order a couple of watered down horchatas(check in offer valid only Mon-Thur, 1 drink per table FYI) and stale-ish chips and possibly the spiciest salsa Pace Picante makes its way to our table while our order is being made.  The Oysters are the first to arrive, good sized plump looking oysters piled high with mixed seafood-shrimp, octopus, and IMITATION CRAB!? Seafood is what you specialize in!?!? This mix was borderline rubbery. Underneath was even worse because the oysters were flavorless. I'm pretty sure whoever shucked the oysters dumped the oyster liquor down the drain, rinsed the oyster and shell, and re assembled everything again. So disappointing  Other flops of the evening...The burrito was plentiful but the red and green sauces on top were straight up enchilada sauces from a bottle/can like the Las Palmas kind. The Shrimp Tecolote were rubbery and overcooked, and halfway through, I was done after seeing that some shrimp weren't deveined properly(see photo).  Are you sure that you're a restaurant that specializes in seafood??? I also later found out we were served the wrong dish by our waitress who suggested this dish! The picture of the correct dish I saw on the Yelp photos shows shell-on shrimp in a red sauce. Ours was nowhere near that. Lots of kitchen errors and a service error recieve no stars from me. The only star is for the great company we had. Seafood specialists? EEK! METHINKS NOT!!!  smh... ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter: N-A-D-A!!!  Will we go back? N-U-N-C-A!!!",

    "text": "I recently found this place on Yelp and decided it was a must try.  Before leaving the house last night, I saw a Yelp friend had just checked in.  When I got there, I joined his wife and him as they finished up and I ordered.  The chips were standard fare but the salsa was very good because it had a good spiciness to it which I like.    For an appetizer, I ordered three shrimp empanadas and for the main course I got the carnitas platter.  I also got a Diet Coke which was served in the can with a straw.  My error was in ordering the two things at the same time or not specifying that I wanted the empanadas first and then the main.  Instead, both dishes were brought at the same time.  The empanadas were very hot (temperature).  The carnitas were lukewarm at best and the food was plated on a cool dish making the beans, rice, and carnitas all not very hot.  This is so different than most Mexican restaurants where you sometimes can hardly touch the hot plates.  The empanadas were the star of my meal.  They were very tasty with a good amount of shrimp pieces in each one.  The green sauce that accompanies them was excellent.  Another spicy sauce that helped make this dish a winner.  Unfortunately, the carnitas were a fail.  The meat was dry and I need to put some Tapatio on for flavor and for moisture.  The beans and rice were standard.    I was going back and forth between my appetizer and my main course at the same time and this detracted from the enjoyment of the meal aside from the temperature problems with the carnitas noted above.  The servers were very friendly and helpful.  As other reviewers have noted, this is a small, hole in the wall restaurant that doesn't seat a whole lot of people at one time.  I joined my friends and there was an extra bit of wait for service--my fault because I didn't stop anyone to let them know I wanted to order.  When brought a menu, it had dripped salsa on it in two places.  There was live music last night with two talented guys.  It was however very loud.  We really had to speak loudly to each other to be heard.    If I come back, it would be for a shrimp cocktail that looked very good (the neighboring table ordered one) and I'd come back for the empanadas.    Finally, you shouldn't have difficulty finding this restaurant if you go to the Charland Plaza at the corner of Charleston and Maryland Parkway.  Just go in the door under the open sign and you won't enter the beauty shop as I did.  As one group was leaving, another friend on Yelp stopped to introduce himself!  Yelp, you're amazing!",

Yeah, funny that I didn't say Mexico, because I sadly didn't get to discover the awesomeness of Michelada while I was traveling out there. Yes, shame on me. Now you can start throwing rocks and food at me for that.   I chose to mix my Michelada with Negra Modelo. They say this is the best combo so I thought, why not go with the best.  The one I had here was mehhh. It was missing some lime, and the ratio of clamato and beer was a bit off for me.   We ordered the giant mixed platter for 4...this can feed 6 people in my opinion. It had imitation crab, real crab (delicious by the way) and shrimp three ways (as a sampler), scallops, clams, and fried fish. The crab (which I think is fried?)  had a great marinade and was delicious. My favorite was the Shrimp Diablo. The flavors in it were so amazing, I'd definitely come back and order this.   I love ceviche, but he one we ordered was a bit too raw for me.   Shrimp empanada- I didn't like this very much, as the outer dough part was too mushy/soggy for me, and I prefer my empanadas to have a little crisp and crunch. The inside shrimp filling was delicious.   The horchata was dang good. The check-in offer is one per table FYI.  Chocolate cake was simple, yet moist and delicious.   I'll definitely be back to get me some more of that shrimp diablo, and the crab is so worth trying.",

We found Mariscos Playa Escondida on yelp and based on the reviews, we decided to give it a try. Do not be discouraged by the location...this place was super delicious!!! I had the Fajitas Mixtas (shrimp, chicken and carne asada w/bell peppers) topped with two pieces of quesadilla. It came with a side plate of rice, beans and salad. Also, the service was very friendly and the wait for the food was not long. I highly recommend this restaurant and would come here again. My total cost was approximately $22 and I left super satisfied.",

This restaurant is off the strip about 3-4 miles (driving) and is very hidden. Nestled in a corner of a shopping center the restaurant itself is very small.  Upon walking in we were greeted right away and sat immediately. Cue the chips and salsa! Fresh chips and salsa- the salsa was very spicy which is good because it woke me up from my hangover comma.   I immediately ordered the \"buen dia\" michelada and it was very tasty and delicious. Fresh shrimp on the rim and with some surprising floating oysters ( I must have not read the description properly) but my reaction was \"what the heck\" in a good way. Mind you- I was nearly dying after binge drinking/partying all night. Plus I LOVE OYSTERS. That buen dia michelada was chugged in matter of seconds.  Onto the main event: I had the \"Vuelve a la vida\" translation = COME TO LIFE and boy did I come to life. It was presented in a this shell shape bowl filled with delicious seafood. This cocktail of seafood was beyond tasty. No joke but after finishing my meal- I felt like a brand new person. LOL.  My friend had the aguacates rellenos- which was very delicious too- fresh ceviche stuffed on top of an avocado- heaven!  Definitely coming back here to cure my hangovers when visiting Vegas- A MUST!  The staff was beyond friendly and the service EXCELLENT!",

Oh boy! was it discovered. This place was worth the drive. It was really tasty.  We ordered a tostada each of #4 spicy aguachile camarones and gosh it arrived packed with so much chunky shrimp.   Flavors are on point.  We accompanied our meal with a michelada de corona, that was real good too.  I really just want to get on a plane fly to LV for some not so simple and magical Mexican food and order me a Molcajete de mariscos.    Service was excellent - these folks really have it going on.  Going back PHO SHO!...LOL!",

If you love seafood this is a must go to place in Las Vegas!!!  We tried the shrimp with green sauce (sorry i don't remember the name now) and it was delicious. The flavor was very natural and overall delicious. We also tried the large shrimp in a spicy red sauce (sorry I'm writing this in Vegas and I don't remember the name) and that was also amazing. We almost licked the plate clean it was so good.  The server was attentive and informative. Took the time to explain to us the items on the menu. He also asked us to tell him how spicy we wanted our food from 1-10. We chose a 7 and to us it was perfect.  So my wife now says this was her favorite seafood place. We're definitely going back now!   The prices were reasonable since they give you a good amount of seafood and the quality was great. Not cheap but not expensive either. Instead of going on the strip for a healthy alternative try this place out.",

A cab will get you here just fine, but good luck getting a cab back. We ended up walking the mile and a half back to the end of the strip. If you plan on doing this, I would say stick to lunch because the areas of town you will walk back through... not so good.   We have a tremendous amount of authentic Mexican food places where we live so while I thought it was definitely yummy and didn't quite understand all of the hype. We ordered a small guacamole to start. It was very heavy on the onions and it felt like they added something in it to make it creamier. I would have rather it been simple with just avocados. Also while the salsa was really flavorful, the chips were too thick for my taste.  I had the fish fillet with the diavlo sauce and it was tasty. It was served with a white rice mix, beans, and a \"salad\" and really yummy corn tortillas. My husband got the chicken enchiladas and he said they were ok.   Oh, and one other thing- their drink menu is limited. No iced tea!",

The food took a while to get out but it was worth the wait and we munched on some chips and salsa. I didn't finish my food and the guy said they don't do take out and I really thought he was serious.

I will be back whenever I'm in Vegas again.",

Tired of buffets and expensive food on our vacation in Vegas we found this hidden gem on Yelp and decided to try it based on all the great reviews, we are so glad we did! It was a little ways off the strip but right off the freeway. Tiny hole in the wall place in a strip mall. The family I was with ordered a bunch of specialty appetizers I had never had and said they were prepared perfectly and in comparison to the restaurants right on the beach in Mexico. My husband and I had shrimp cocktails. The juice and large amount of shrimp was perfect! We had soda, aguas frescas and prepared beer and it was all on point. The prices were great and they even accepted credit card which was great for us travelers. The salsa is delicious and the waitresses were so attentive and friendly. We ordered so much food and were enjoying our company we were probably there for a few hours; it was such an inviting atmosphere. We will be back!!",

They need to step up their game and have fresh tortilla chips. The salsa was good. Our appetizer was the mixed seafood ceviche which was spectacular. Michleadas are great. My kids ordered Horchatas also great. Big ass mugs for both. Our entrees were a shrimp cocktail (excellent), carnitas which were moist and very authentic, Carne asada that was very good and a mixed seafood cocktail that had plenty of seafood. Crab, scallops, an oyster, shrimp and octopus. It was to die for. My wife also ordered shrimp empanadas. Wow so good. I got a little crazy and on top of my seafood cocktail I ordered a dozen oysters topped with ceviche. First off they gave me more then a dozen. Is that norm I don't know but I'm glad they did because the whole family dug in. Even my 15 yr old and 9 yr old grabbed a few.       This will be a monthly outing for us. Be careful it can be missed. It's tucked away behind a tacos Mexico in a shopping center that looks half abandoned. Trust me it's well worth the adventure. Enjoy it.",
