The mimosas were also good and strong.  My husband and I managed to get through about 14 of the tapas items and 3 mimosas each.  We had to take a nap after but it was totally worth it!  It's a MUST if you like mexican food.",

    "text": "I am shocked at the five star reviews. The service was great and the food came out fast but none of the three items I had was any good. The Tamale which is my favorite Mexican item was just corn slop and a mess to unwrap. It was like opening a babies dirty diaper. The jicama salad was extremely bitter. the sweetness of the dates was not enough to counter how bitter the salad was. The duck was served rare and was really tough to chew. I love duck and order it every time I see it on a menu. This duck I sent back which I never do. I have sent food back just a couple times in my life. I expected so much more and was really disappointed with the food. The table next to me also did not like their food. They tried a couple bites then paid the check and left leaving two complete dinners on the table. It could not be the timing because the food is served extra fast at this restaurant.",

Went there this morning and I am still trying to break out of the food coma I was put in.  It's a tapas-style serving with a huge list of unique gastronomic concoctions.  Some really wild recipes... all very delicious.  The only thing I will say is that I was a little disappointed in the bacon bloody mary, but the food more than made up for that.  It's especially nice to be able to sit out on the patio in mid-November and enjoy the spread in this unusual warm weather.  Definitely try this out... foodies will enjoy it!",

I had the Yucatan Pork and it was just delicious. I hate yams but the yams it came with were amazing and complimented the warm home made corn tortillas wonderfully. A little pork, some yams, and those tortillas was heaven. Love on a plate! The second time I went I had the special which was Short rib tacos with a roasted corn salsa and cheese grits on top of their home made corn tortillas. It was dry rubbed so it had a nice spice to it and just fell apart. Delicious, amazing, delicious, no words can describe how amazing it was. I will def. be going to the Border Grill close to my house in Santa Monica, I am a customer for life. Autumn was amazing. One of the best servers I have had since I was in Vegas though the 2 days I went to Border Grill the hostesses were sub part. One was suppose to bring me a bunch menu and just completely forgot and it wasn't even busy. That aside this place was pretty much flawless!",

    "text": "Great place for an excellent lunch! After spending a little too long on the lazy river at Mandalay Beach and floating by the sign one too many times we decided that the Border Grill would be the perfect place for lunch!  To start the fresh chips and salsa were great although the salsa verde had a strange after taste that we couldn't place and made for a weird lingering on the palate. This salsa bad enough to take away a star!  We started with the Border Classics on suggestion from a fellow yelper that the Plantain Empanadas were a must. The Border Classic is a sampler platter consisting of 2 Plantain Empanadas, 2 Green Corn Tamales, and 2 Chicken Panuchos. The Plantain Empanadas were amazing both sweet and savory all at once and a hint of Queso Fresco in every bite. The Green Corn Tamales almost brought tears to my eyes because they were the first sweet corn tamale that has ever come close to the ones my Great Aunt used to make me when I was a kid! As for the Chicken Panuchos my wife Bogarted those because she hated the other two choices, but her loss was definitely my gain!  For a main dish we went with the Albacore Avocado Ceviche which did not disappoint! It was half an avocado pilled high with sushi-grade albacore and a decadent lime-salsa mixture! The only thing that was missing was a spicy kick to top of the flavor combinations.  To top it off the waitress we had was super attentive, knew the menu by heart, and even warned us not to over order when we tried to add another entree to our order before we had even seen the appetizers. We will definitely be back to the Border Grill!",

Add in the $5 bottomless mimosas and this was a great dining experience.  Out of our table of 6, 4 of us did the AYCE small plates and we shared them, family-style.  Our waiter suggested that they bring out everything on the AYCE menu for us to try in waves.  I was in 7th heaven!  All the small plates were awesome; my favorites being the pork brisket, fritatta, churro tots, and several others that I can't recall.  And each round of mimosas were something new for us to try: pomegranate, peach, prickly pear, etc.  It was a great experience with an opportunity to try a lot of different items.  I called it a lazy man's buffet because they bring it all to your table!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting so yummy Mexican brunch food.",

Had the grilled fish tacos that are made with a cucumber citrus slaw on homemade corn tortillas and served with black beans and both red and green rice. So ridiculously yummy and very filling. Should have stopped after two tacos, but they were so good I had to eat all three.   The Watermelon Mojito, on the other hand, was a different story - very disappointing. It didn't taste like watermelon. Maybe if you closed your eyes and tried really hard, you could taste a very faint hint of it, but otherwise not really.",

    "text": "After checking out the Shark Reef, I was hungry for sushi but I felt that eating sushi after gazing at aquatic animals for the past 2 hours would of been morally wrong.    Okay, on to the review.  First of all, I'd like to say I love guacamole.  I put it on everything.  Undercooked chicken?  Guacamole.  Overcooked rib eye?  Guacamole.  Guacamole fixes everything and makes it magically delicious.  With that said, I DID NOT eat the guacamole at Border Grill BUT I did see someone who sat diagonally across from my girlfriend and I who was GETTIN DOWN on some guacamole.  I was jealous.  Instead, I satified my palatte by slamming 2 strawberry margaritas back to back and some Baja Ceviche.  The Baja Ceviche was awesome, the seasonal fish and cilantro ailoli gave it a nice flavor!  Unique to any other ceviche I've tried in the past.  Highly suggest it.  I finished my meal with a trip to the dessert menu where I got the Pastel Rufina.  The description says, \"layers of puff pastery, sweetened cream cheese, chocolate chunks, and fresh berries\".  So I'm thinking this is gonna be some mini dessert.  Well, it turns out, this dessert is MASSIVE.  But luckily, I have a bottomless stomach so I destroyed it without much struggle.  Kudos to our server, she was very helpful and knowledgeble of the menu.  She also looked like a girl I've seen on NaughtyAmerica ....but that's a whole different review.",

    "text": "WOW! THIS is the experience that marks my return to Yelp!  I watched a special on the food network where they selected a new chef for the Border Grill restaurant in Downtown LA.  So while staying at THEHotel (part of Mandalay Bay), I was pleasantly surprised to see the restaurant had a location right here at my hotel (by the Shark reef and overlooking \"the beach\"). Three wonderful people greeted us and the host stand and quickly sat us at what looked like a prime spot in the patio right by a heated lamp overlooking the city.   A handsome young and very tall guy came with chips and salsa and asked if we wanted some fresh guacamole. YES PLEASE! Our server (not as tall or handsome as our chip deliverer) came by 20 or so minutes later and without much fanfare took our order.  Friend and I both got the $42 special which comes with a preselected appetizer sampler, 1 entree of our choosing and 1 dessert.  For what I thought was going to be high-end that sounded reasonable.  I ordered a spicy sangria as well (based on the servers recommendation).  After we ordered, I asked our waiter for more chips (gimme a break - it's a Mexican restaurant for gods sake and I'm in Vegas so i can have more than one cheat day) and I reminded him that our guacamole (our $10 guacamole, mind you) never came.  He apologized and said he'd get that right out. Got my Spicy Sangria, it wasn't bad.  My friend said it tasted like cough medicine.  Once he said that, it was over.  I could do nothing but taste cough medicine. ICK! After 20 minutes passed, our food came out by a runner.  I told the runner that I really needed the chips at this point AND the guacamole.  I wasn't playing around anymore. Another runner brought out more chips.  Where's our waiter??  We'd seen so many others at this point that I couldn't even remember what our waiter looked like to begin with.  He finally showed up.  I told him to cancel the guacamole that never came....which in restaurant language should mean, \"bring the goddamn effing guacamole but you better make sure you don't charge for it so you can still get your 20% tip and make up for the sh***y service so far. He sort of apologized but really couldn't care less. The appetizer sampler consisted of 3 items on a plate (sorry I don't know what any are called) and was fairly good. My dish, Kobe beef tacos, consisted of three mini soft tacos with dry lukewarm pieces of Kobe. PASS!  My friend got the chicken dish which wasn't so bad and, unlike mine, didn't look like a tapa or appetizer plate. For dessert, when our waiter finally reappeared (I swear to god I have never had such terrible service, not even at my local Marie Calendars) I ordered the Tres Leches which was DIVINE!  I don't even have much of a sweet tooth and I almost devoured that thing.  It was just the right amount of sweetness.  No extreme flavors and the texture of cake was just perfection. My friend got the flourless choco cake which he enjoyed.  I thought the chocolate was just to overbearing. Anyway, the bill came out and we were charged for both 3 course specials and the sangria BUT as our waiter put down our check, he did apologize again for the guacamole.......could he get anymore sincere.  He could've made up for it by bringing us a free item, a discount OR by actually starting to be more attentive to us and giving us better service.  He does none of that but as soon as its time to write down his tip, he blurts out an apology. So uncomfortable.  Anyway, I kept the receipt and I'm mailing a copy directly to Susan Feniger, who, based on that food network show, doesn't look like she would put up with any of that in one of her restaurants.",

While the lunch and dinner options are very good, my highest recommendation is the weekend brunch with unlimited small plates and bottomless mimosas. Food is awesome and creative. Servers are always so good, keeping the champagne flowing and small plates coming out to try the whole menu.  I enjoy the vibe/ambience at this location more so than the Forum Shops location as it overlooks the Mandalay pool / property and has outdoor seating options as opposed to just being in a mall.  Brunch ends up being like $65/person but worth it. You can eat and drink yourself silly and definitely no need to buy lunch that day!",

I had what I would say are the worst fish tacos I have had in a long time.  The fish was fishy and horrible, and the corn tortillas were bad. They didn't have cabbage on top, I don't really know what it was but it was bad. The chips were oily and not good and my mate had a \"half chicken\" that was more like a pigeon. It was so tasteless he asked for some torillas to use with and and a ton of salsa.  if you are stuck in the Mandalay Bay, find somewhere else, I remember this place being okay, but frankly it is not very good.",

Someone had recommended the Mandalay Bay buffet due to their excellent mimosas, but the tapas style of this restaurant sounded very interesting.  We loved it!  Not every plate was to our liking, but it doesn't matter because you can do both unlimited plates and bottomless mimosas.  The tamales were so good!  Their mimosas were not made from the greatest champagne but they had a great variety of flavors.  Try them all!  Our favorites were the traditional (why mess with perfection) and the pomegranate.  I am excited to get back to Vegas to try  again!",

The prices are kind of ridiculous. I mean, I guess that's to be expected on the Strip, but seriously? $15 for a portion of ceviche on an averaged sized tostada?! You can get that for literally no more than $3.75 at any taqueria ever. However, it's convenient, the food is okay, and after a long day walking around sometimes you just wanna eat the first thing you can get your hands on. Oh, the green corn tamales we got from the Yelp check in were pretty tasty.",

It was sweet to start off with but good. They also give you chips and salsa, i did like how there were three different salsa options. I always make the fatal mistake of getting full on the chips n salsa it self. My co worker got the taco salad which she liked- it was an average taco salad. I got the tacos: cauliflower (which I didn't like), Shrimp (which was too spicy but good) and steak (the taco I enjoyed the most). It was very very tiny tacos so it was very messy to eat.   Service: All our servers were nice, our main waitress was super sweet. She bought us two tamales instead of one since there was two of us. Very quick since we were in a rush, we appreciated that very much.   Atmosphere: it was a cute spot and very happy that we got to sit outside, we were desperate for some sunlight.   I'd go here again for a quick Mexican bite.",

I know he meant well but constant references to how he knows best (including upselling) and stopping by every 2 minutes was kind of off putting. Then again, maybe he took a hint because after our food was dropped off he was nowhere to be found. We had to flag a manager to get our bill.  As for the food.. The octopus appetizer was wonderfully tender. The entrees however.. My dining partner got the skirt steak and asked for another vegetable side in place of the pepper strips that came with it. He really doesn't like peppers. Well, it came with a loadful of peppers. The steak was also on the salty side. He had to scrape off the chimchurri on it. I had the shrimp and scallop dish. Oily and not much garlic flavor.  Aside from the octopus, maybe we ordered the wrong things. The experience just wasn't on par with the price.",

It was creamy and fresh. For our entrees, we got beef brisket taquitos, steak tacos and sauteed shrimp which were great. The meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor. Too bad I got the grilled fish tacos.  The tacos were nicely plated with red, white and green rice.  However, I had fish bones on my tacos and had to send them back 3 times!  By the third time, I still had fish bones and I just gave up on my entree.  A girl could only take so much bone swallowing in one night.  They comped my tacos and our desserts which we appreciated: Flourless Chocolate Cake, Tres Leches Cake and another dessert.  They were ok.  It was a disappointing meal.  I felt bad for our server who had to keep sending my plate back to the kitchen.  I'm not a diner who's a PITA and I don't make complaining a habit either but seriously, whoever was in charge of de-boning and filleting fish that night shouldn't be let back in the kitchen.  Border Grill fish tacos? NEVER again!",

Everything was spaced out nicely and we were definitely not underserved. Our waiter, Luis, was fantastic, providing attentive, intuitive service.",

It is not a buffet or butler service, it is an order your small plates and wait for 20 minutes and hope you get what you order situation. Service was painfully slow and dishes were forgotten on three different occasions - out of only five chances is too many mistakes. Water and teas were often empty too. Food was decent, but seemed very repetitive. Maybe I'll come back for dinner again, but there are dozens of Sunday brunch options that crush this place.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvegas.eater.com%2Fmaps%2F46-places-to-eat-brunch-in-las-vegas-dec-2014&s=595ee2dd0f8de54a24d3323d0ef8ff5c2e71e8467d4670e10ca141df3f24c9ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vegas.eater.com/maps/46-...</a>",

The majority of my paper members indulged in the $35.00 all you can eat brunch.  The brunch consisted of small tapas style plates, such as (a Gluten Free Yogurt Parfait, BBQ Brisket Sliders, Tomatillo Egg Benedict, Serrano Ham Waffle and more).  For an additional $10 you can add the bottomless mimosas to your order.  If you think these prices are to high, then you will be missing out on SUCH amazing food!   The food was so good, we ended up staying four hours.  During our visit, we continued to see various brunch items walk past us and we tried almost everything from the menu and continued to seek more.  This is a restaurant I will be visiting again, and again.  I can't wait for my family to arrive for the holiday's so that they are able to try out this establishment.",

Owned by Mary Sue and Susan (I know of them from their radio food show once on KFI Los Angeles), this is a GREAT Mexican food restaurant, from ambiance to the sauces.  Especially the salsas and sauces.    Tip:  If you're only at Mandalay Bay to visit them for lunch or dinner, park in the Convention parking lot, as they're close to that lot, near the Shark Reef.  Otherwise, you'll have to trek a ways from the main casino (which isn't bad, considering you can walk off the calories on the way back).  Tip 2:  If you like really really hot salsa, like the addictive kind that makes you cry but you just can't stop eating it, ask your server for the \"diablo\" salsa.  Tip 3:  If the climate is decent (sunny, 70's-80's) ask if you can be seated out on the patio for nice ambiance.",

When our food arrived, the potatoes were the first thing I tried. Immediately, I sensed that it had pork or beef in it and asked if it had bacon. I almost threw up in my napkin because of the smell and the taste (if you're a meat-eater you'll not be able to understand). The waitress replied in the negative but then mentioned that it might be fried in the same oil used to fry animal products. She didn't understand how it mattered for vegetarians. Any average restaurant should know this let alone something that's located in Mandalay Bay. It seemed like amateur hour in restauranting (not an actual word). Pretty much all the dishes tasted like it had been cooked in the same oil though the waitress and the manager vehemently denied it. In most restaurants, a goof-up like this will get you a profuse apology but not in this one. My wife and I woke up to an upset stomach that had us taking turns to the bathroom. Eat here at your own risk!",

The hostess at front greeted us right away and was very polite when asking if we would like to sit inside or outside.  She admitted it was a bit chilly so inside might be best.  We were seated quickly at a nice 4 top in the middle of the dinning room.  Our server Autumn seemed to be one of the only servers working.  She greeted us quickly and was super nice!  She took our drink orders and recommended some specialty margaritas.  However I was not drinking that evening so I did not try any.  When she came back she asked us if we were told about the \"secret menu item.\"   We were not, so she told us about a short rib burrito with manchego cheese sauce. This sounded great so someone in our party ordered it and it very much met the high recommendation. Everyone ordered and enjoyed their meals. I got the fresh fish tacos that were really good.  I opted out of the grapefruit slices on it but they came to the table with them anyway, which turned out to be better than I expected. The corn tortillas didn't fall apart like I had expected.  I ordered a side of cilantro rice which seemed a little dry but was still flavorful.  Food came out in a good amount of time and Autumn was consistently sweet and engaging the entire time.",

I have never had even a slightly so-so experience at Border Grill. Everything has always been fantastic here. And that's over the course of a few years and at all times of the day.  Personally, I prefer to eat outside on the patio (which overlooks the pool area). And you can't go wrong with choosing a drink or entree off the rotating list of specials.  The various margaritas and mojitos I have tried have all been great. And my favorite standard menu item is the chile relleno. Absolutely one of the best chile rellenos I've ever had anywhere.  And be sure to check out their brunch menu. The entree offerings are interesting and flavorful. And seriously some of the best (and biggest) cinnamon rolls ever.  I also really appreciate the fact that they have a locals VIP club. When you join, you get a discount card for 15% off your meal every time you visit and you receive various special offers via email. You gotta like Strip restaurants that offer some locals love.",

NOT ONLY IS THIS WRONG, IT IS ILLEGAL!   Border Grill was throwing a bridal event today so I went with my mom. We showed up a little early so we decided to get drinks with guac and chips at the bar while we waited. I ordered a titos vodka with soda & a splash of cranberry. When I tasted it I immediately knew something didn't taste right I told the bartender - who was very polite - and he made me another one, but it tasted the same. I told him again and said, I don't think this is Titos because it tastes like jalapeno or something. So he went to smell the bottle and immediately made a face like WHAT IS THIS?! He asked the other bartender to smell it and when she did she didn't even look the slightest bit shocked. So he opened a new bottle and made me a 3rd drink and it was finally right. So that means they are taking random liquors and pouring them into premium bottles and charging you more for a lower shelf liquor.. While he and the server that brought our chips our guac out were really friendly, I just can't let it go when I pay $25 for two drinks that were not only the wrong liquor they had the nerve to give me a dried our lime wedge, almost totally flat soda, and not to mention the drink was so weak if I didn't see him pour the drink I would have never believed there was vodka in it. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone especially if you're going to drink. Very disappointed.",

A little better, but we waited about 30-40minutes for food.  When it finally arrived, there was a hair on my daughter's plate.

    "text": "Wow this place has gone downhill! I ordered crane asada tacos and they brought out what they claim is wagyu tacos which were horrible. The house made tortillas were undercooked. Tortilla soup had so many onions it should have been called onion soup also no lime with the soup. The beans were cold and nasty! The kitchen doesn't like to do modifications here so don't ask obviously there's a chef with an attitude back there who needs to go. It's no wonder the place was empty. This place used to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in town and I used to recommend it to everyone. Just goes to show when ownership gets big (Susan) and popular and has multiple restaurants and gets corporate  they don't pay attention to the places that got them there make sure to avoid this place and go somewhere else for dinner. Boooo border grill shame on you!",

From the host to the waitress, everyone was phenomenal.   Was a little concerned about gluten cross contamination, so I had the caesar salad without croutons. This is my old standby, and it was delicious! Everything had a nice presentation as well.",

    "text": "I'm not a regular writer of reviews here or anywhere. I was, however, so impressed with this restaurant that I am moved to share. I haven't put much stock in Yelp to date and any person, site or entity that gives Popeye's Chicken 4 stars lack credibility in my mind.  So I'm giving my honest opinion here from a person who eats at all types of dining establishments often.   This may be the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. I chose the Skirt Steak and a Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita. I enjoy spicy food as much or more than most people as long as it's not a substitute for flavor. I half expected the Margarita to be a throat searing eyes watering nose running test of heat tolerance. It was quite the opposite. There was a little heat but the Cucumber was very cool and refreshing. Score a big one and I've not eaten anything but the chips and salsa and that was very good as well. Three salsas were presented and all were mild with excellent flavor. I liked the Tomatillo best.   The main course for me was the Skirt Steak. I asked for medium and it was cooked perfectly. No small feat for a cut as thin as the skirt steak. The cut was tender and juicy with an excellent layering of flavors that let the meat be the star of the show. The black beans had a bit of Cotija cheese, but not overly salty. Also included on the plate was a cucumber, onion and tomato salad that made an excellent accompaniment. The portions were appropriate for a dinner that might include three or four courses. It was all I ate and I was pleasantly full and took no leftovers home.  We sat on the patio, though being on the second floor and completely covered it barely felt like being outdoors. The breeze blowing through occasionally, made for a comfortable atmosphere reminiscent of a Pacific Coast Mexican restaurant. The patio was a bit on the noisy side as there were few soft surfaces to dull the sounds of the many conversations going on around us.   The wait staff made fine recommendations and were attentive to our needs. Our waiter recommended my meal and drink and I'm glad he did.   I thought the prices were reasonable for anywhere in the US and exceptionally reasonable for Las Vegas   Over all I would say that if you are in Las Vegas and have a hunger for Mexican food, grab cab and head over to the the Mandalay Bay and get yourself a table at the Border Grill",

It is all you can eat for $35 with $8 bottomless mimosas (inquire for a \"locals\" discount).  There are about 20 different things to choose from. Sweet, savory, vegetarian and carnivorous.

    "text": "I've been to the Border Grill in Santa Monica several times so I was stoked that there was one in the hotel we were staying (Mandalay Bay).    We wanted to find a particular restaurant that is by the Mandalay Beach but couldn't find it.  We saw the Border Grill straight ahead so we went there instead.    We got seated right away and our waitress was very bubbly and attentive.  They bring you chips and three different salsas while you wait for your meal.  They are all different and good.  We ate all the salsa so our waitress brought us another tray. I ordered the thing that I always order: The Border Classics (plantain empanadas, corn tamales and paunches)...I get this because it's a bit of everything.    Plantain Empanadas: outside of the empanada is made of plantain, not flour dough.  They are filled with black beans and topped with cojita cheese.  So savory and delicious, yet so healthy!!  Corn Tamales: creamy sweet corn crapped in banana (?) leaves.  Sweet/dessert-like.  Reminds me of that sweet corn dessert that they have at El Torito. My favorite Mexican dessert!!  Panuchos: chicken on a thick homemade, fried tortilla.  Good, but not my fav.   My bf got the carne asada quesadilla: grilled steak, carmelized onions, arbol salsa, cojita, manchego and panela cheese.  This is a quesadilla on steroids...very scrumptious.  If you're in the mood for a quessadilla, this will HIT THE SPOT.   The other things I've tried at the Santa Monica location are the ceviche and the jalapeno cucumber margarita.  I love both of them and highly recommend them to first timers!",

We made reservation through Open Table and were seated as soon as they opened. Our server Autumn was great, and I never got to the bottom of one mimosa before another one was at the table. The mimosas are some of the best I've ever had and come in a variety of flavors (passion fruit, grape fruit, peach, etc). My husband had the cafe de olla which was also really good.   We made it through 10 of the 22 tapas plates. My favorite was the waffle since it was nice and crispy, and my husband liked the steak and eggs so much that he ordered it twice. My least favorite was the Churro Tots, because I was expecting something crunchy like a churro while they were actually more like doughnut holes.   We will definitely return to finish off the rest of the menu!",

Cucumber Mojtio: Yummy and refreshing Pomegranate Mojito: Just eh.. kinda had a strong artificial cherry taste. Not recommended.  Baja Ceviche: Fresh and plenty to share. Steak enchiladas ($23): Seemed to be an ongoing special of some kind (off the normal menu). Yummy steak with mole sauce.. very very good. If you aren't terribly hungry 2 could probably fill up on this + ceviche and chips making for a relatively inexpensive meal. I couldn't come close to finishing it by myself.   Service was excellent. Bartenders were friendly. Best of all our waitress asked if we were locals and gave us a VIP card for 15% off everytime we come... every little bit helps in this pricey town!",

My girlfriend ordered shrimp relleno tacos, which she thought were awful. There were way too many sauces and competing ingredients, which did not blend well together. The tacos were so unpleasant she wasn't even able to finish half of her entree, and she is not a picky eater. At this price point, the food shouldn't be so terrible she is unable to eat it.",

After being informed we would be charged charged for water(!), and also chips and salsa, we also discovered the entrees don't come with sides, those are also up sells.  Food was OK, but 3 out of 4 dishes were tiny, and I would compare the quality to something like On the Border (who can somehow manage to provide not only water but also chips and salsa for free!).  Most of the entrees were in the mid-$20 range, which normally isn't bad, but It seemed like every visit from our waiter turned into yet another hard sell.  Somehow 4 (tiny) kids quesadillas, an adult vegetable quesadilla, 3 small fish tacos, 1 lemonade and 1 soda wound up being 100 bucks??!  I don't mind paying the money if the food/service is worth it, but in this case it definitely wasn't.",

I haven't eaten out too many places since the celiac diagnosis, because I'm too sensitive to risk the gluten exposure, but i was meeting up with my folks in Vegas for the weekend and I was determined to have a birthday dinner. I emailed ahead of time and they were so enthusiastic about making me a safe (glutenfree) and vegan meal, I was immediately excited.   Since there isn't much on the menu that's GF and vegan (there's some great GF *or* vegan items though), the chef made my partner and I something special... little tiny veggie tacos on little soft corn tortillas that were positively orgasmic. When I have tacos at home now, I'm always sad they're not those delicious perfect little soft corn tortillas from Border Grill. The guacamole was delicious, and the chips were warm and fresh.   They accidentally put cheese on our black beans, but fixing the plates were no big deal and was done graciously. Also? Those black beans were DELICIOUS. I wish I knew their secrets. Or that they'd open up a location in San Francisco.   I can't even find the words to do this place justice. If you're in Vegas, this is worth every penny. (And it wasn't as many pennies as I expected, either.)  Note to the gimps like me: It's quite a trek from the entrance to the restaurant, but it's an easily accessible straight shot on wheels. Sometimes you have to really go out of you way to get to the ramps and elevators. Not here.",

    "text": "Best brunch I've had in years, and our best meal of the trip.   We took a trip to Vegas for my 30th birthday this past weekend and originally planned on trying out a Bobby Flay restaurant.  Once I realized Susan Feniger had a place attached to our hotel (we were at the Luxor) I changed our plans - I have the chance to eat at a Bobby Flay place any day of the week but Feniger only has restaurants on the west coast.  Anyway.  We had a reservation for 11:30am through OpenTable.  When we arrived we were greeted warmly by the hostesses who took us immediately to our choice of table - outside  on the patio flanked by two heaters.  Our server, Christopher, was right over to see us and was incredibly friendly.  He honestly made what was already a wonderful experience twice as great because he was attentive, helpful, and really enthusiastic.    We placed our bottomless mimosa orders - one classic, one grapefruit, one white peach, and one pomegranate - and he brought them right away and kept bringing them.  Often they showed up when we were only halfway through the last one.  The four of us had 23 mimosas and we were only there about an hour and 15 minutes so they weren't skimping on the drinks.  They were all great, but I was partial to the peach.  Very fresh and tasty.  I had hoped we would try everything on the menu of all you can eat tapas (for $29?  what a bargain!) but we ended up way too full.  We did try all of these:  Guava Empanada - These came out before we ordered and I passed, as I'm not a fan of guava.  One of our friends has celiacs and cannot eat gluten so he also passed.  The other two said they were hot, flaky, and delicious.  Biscuit and Chipotle Gravy - We got a platter of four servings done of these (easier if everyone wants to try something) in our first flight of items and they were very good, but not great.    Chorizo and Egg Taco - This is on all of our lists of best things we ate there, as well as the entire trip.  The tortilla was clearly made in house, fresh, and very tasty.  Had there been room in our stomachs at the end, we would have gone for another platter.  Frittata Tart - Another of our first items, this was so light and tasty I was kind of amazed.  We spent a good 15 minutes discussing egg white techniques to figure out how this was done.    Peruvian Shrimp and Grits - Glad we ordered a platter of these, because otherwise I would have had to scrape everyone elses plates.  The shrimp were delicious, the grits were easily the creamiest and best I've ever had (hard to admit, for a born southerner), and the sauce was something I could see eating on everything.  Literally.  Forever.  We did everything short of licking the plate clean.  Yucatan Egg Benedict - This was also very delicious, and the key was the crispy carnitas stuffed inside the bread under the egg.  A great combo of sweet and spicy, creamy and crunchy.  I'd easily eat a full size portion of this for breakfast.  Crispy Potato Rajas Taco - Crispy fried potatoes inside a fried tortilla shell drizzled in creamy spicy sauce, grilled corn, and avocado.  Nothing crazy, but still tasty.  I imagine these would be a great hangover food.  Machaca Chilaquiles - I was the only one at the table who knew what this was before it came, so it was great to see this be the first time my friends had chilaquiles.  These were delicious.  Just enough crunch left from the chips to give it a great texture.    Churro Tots - No shame, I ordered two plates of these just for myself.  So good.  Light and fluffy inside, crispy outside.  Hot and cinnamony, just little balls of perfection.  Who knows what the two dipping sauces tasted like, I was too busy shoving them down my gullet to care.      Green Corn Tamale - Sweet and creamy, but not heavy.  These were a bit of a surprise as I had misread the menu and thought they were green CHILE tamales, but nonetheless we scraped the husks clean.  Breakfast Enchilada - This was delicious.  Fresh and bright, a hint of citrus, and not overly goopy and cheesy like restaurant enchiladas you usually find.    Short Rib Hash and Egg - This was easily the ugliest dish we ate all day, and hands down the overwhelming favorite.  We shared one portion, then promptly ordered three more.  The meat was mouthwatering, the onions were perfect, and what could have been easily ruined by an ill prepared egg was accented by the perfectly scrambled ones atop each portion.  We talked about this dish in bed that night and on the flight home.  I can seriously throw down in the kitchen but I don't know about recreating this little plate of awesome.  It was so great, I'd be scared to tarnish our memories of it.   My one friend is rarely one to wholeheartedly recommend a place to eat - if you ask her about somewhere she's been she will only recommend somewhere that gets a full five star rating from her.  She said halfway through the meal that she would easily tell someone they had to eat brunch here.  We all agreed, wholeheartedly.",

We were seated within minutes of our reservation ,  our server was polite but missed the mark for attentiveness with our needs, although she suggested delicious alcoholic drinks. The idea of asking if we wanted rice and beans with our Mexican dinner is an old trick to up sell, you see in most of the country rice and beans comes with a traditional Mexican dinner . Here at BG it does not but , the server fails to tell you that and sneaks an up sell  to the bill.. The  Appetizers were served quickly , Cerviche was tasty and fresh, the guacamole was standard Costco , and the Empanadas were tasteless.  The main course , we had a flat iron steak with chimichurra sauce , the steak was cooked correctly , but the server said that they were making fresh chimichurra sauce and it would be out momentarily, well, my meal was half gone before she realized that my dish wasn't complete  and ran out with the freshly made chimichurra.. Folks , it's Friday night , have your preps done before the guest arrive .. We also had the Chicken Enchiladas with a delicious green sauce and mushrooms , different but , very tasty.. The night took too long so we had to forgo our favorite dessert time.. I would give BG another shot , and hope it was just a bad night .  The 2 star rating is the best I could go for this visit , at $65 per person when you have 2 children included is a tad bit expensive for Mexican food even from a New Yorkers stand point.",

Very delicious too. And leave some of the guacamole to add on top of their scrumptious tacos. Add some salsa on top too for an extra kick.   As a great alternate, try their seafood enchiladas. Loaded with lobster shrimp and crab. The lobster mushroom sauce has a lot of flavor",

But +1 for fulfilling our personal request; they were able to prepare the spicy black bean dip, normally available for lunch.  My favorite was the caramelized plantains. Good selection of vegetarian items. Server seemed too caught up, didn't see her around much.  Standard Mexican food acceptable for Vegas. Sounds like their brunch might be a better choice.",

We were very excited to be in Vegas on a Sunday to try the brunch at the Mandalay Bay Border Grill.  This was a family reunion with five us from different areas of the United States.  We opted for the champagne add-on for our brunch \"experience\" .  It was an experience...a bad experience.  The mimosas tasted odd, likely because of the low quality sparkling that was used.  The food lacked in all aspects and all five of us have different palates and each of us felt that the food was boring and underwhelming for each course.  We realized that this was a small plate format brunch, but two small plates for five of us was messy and difficult to pass around.  The server insisted that she only bring one type of food on each delivery which seemed odd, but we went along with this.  The wait between dishes was too long and after discussing the offerings between the five of us we decided to cut our losses and move on with our day.",

They don't have any within the restaurant, and you have to go downstairs and down the hallway. It was a bummer, but didn't ruin my short experience there.",

It wasn't too crowded when we arrived, but it's a lovely establishment with nice decor and service to match. We wanted a relaxed dinner and we got it.   I ordered a trio of soft tacos and they were very tasty. Quality stuff, no qualms about it. My only issue is that if you want a side of rice or beans then you have to order it separately and it's pretty pricey. On one hand I understand the business mechanics of it and it's a restaurant in a hotel in Vegas so, really, what am I complaining about? But I am, so it is what it is.   Overall this is a great place to check out for a nice meal. Sit outside in the evening to take in those warm Vegas nights.",

The sauce wasn't anything amazing.  Carne Asada: meat was super tender and cooked to perfection! Enjoyed this one the most.  Brisker Taquito: juicy and filling! Was my second favorite.

We thought our waitress placed our order but after 20 minutes we knew something was wrong since all we ordered was a salad and a quesadilla. Our waitress was also no where to be seen during this time. We were seated outside in Las Vegas during the heat of the day and wasn't checked in to make sure we had drinks refilled. I notified the manager and we found out our order was never entered and it looked like our waitress was on break and relied on another staff member to cover. Even though management sent an appetizer to compensate this incompetency, our order still wasn't placed correctly. When our food finally came another 30 minutes it was not what we ordered. I gave 2 stars only because management tried to rectify the incompetency. However, their management team should have followed through to make sure our order was correct and should have came to our table check in. Neither the waitress or management came by again. Needless to say, we would never go back.",

We've honestly been a bit disappointed with the range of food quality and the ubiquitous amount of overpriced chain restaurants in Las Vegas, but we know that's how it goes. After all, we didn't come here for the culinary experience.  However, Border Grill was by far superior, and was a great experience.   I didn't anticipate authentic cuisine as it was marketed, but it was actually very close. I was prepared for mediocre Tex-Mex and that does NOT describe this wonderful place. The meats were just right, the salsas were incredibly fresh, and the drinks were high quality. Atmosphere was classy and pleasant as well.  The cherry on top? We had absolutely phenomenal service here today. Our server was so down to earth, helpful, and attentive that he alone could have made the entire experience.

    "text": "My friends and I visited the Border Grill at Mandalay Bay for Sunday brunch. The ambiance of the restaurant inside was unremarkable, but we sat out on the balcony to avoid having to wait. This was clearly the best choice, both because its sunny atmosphere lends to a delightful brunch, and because the inside of the restaurant smelled of lead-based paint that morning.  The service was exemplary, especially in light of how busy the place was - timely but not uncomfortably attentive. The brunch is an all-you-can-eat selection of \"small plates,\" - though a European person probably wouldn't consider them small. The small plates menu is rather extensive, meaning I'll have to come back.  The eggs Benedict was hands down my favorite course of the meal. The egg sits atop the Hollandaise sauce, and was poached perfectly. The Hollandaise sauce was fresh, properly seasoned and of a good consistency, though not quite lemony enough for my liking. The egg and sauce sit atop a delightfully crispy fried green tomato, which sits atop properly cooked grits with feta cheese. The feta cheese in the grits was a surprisingly tasty discovery, and I'll have to try it myself.   The shrimp & grits left something to be desired. The shrimp did not taste particularly fresh, which was a disappointment given that the restaurant is in a casino hotel. Its sauce didn't help the situation either. I prefer a cream or white wine sauce and this one had something that aspired to a red-eye gravy. Some opted for the bottomless mimosas, which come in a dizzying number of flavors.  Overall, the Border Grill is worth the trip. Just remember to sit on the balcony and don't gamble on the shrimp.",

The chips were good, but the salsa was rather bland. Our waiter talked us into the \"special guacamole\" that tasted like it was straight from a jar and surprisingly small (two small scoops), and it was basically mushed-up avocado - tasteless, not seasoned, no cilantro, no onions.  My wife had a bowl of the pozole, which had a nice flavor and tastefully spicy, however, it had way too much chicken. Another person had the brisket taquitos, which she did not care for. Two of us had the fish tacos, which were good but not amazing -- I've had better tacos from food trucks.",

    "text": "I had been to the Border Grill once before for their Sunday brunch and I found it excellent.  Today, we stopped in for a late lunch and had another excellent meal.  We got an order of bacon guacamole for an appetizer and it came with four wedges of seasoned chips.  The guacamole was excellent.  The cotija cheese gave the guacamole a super flavor in addition to the bacon.  The chips tasted a bit stale and didn't have the crispness of their taco chips.  We were brought the complimentary chips and 3 salsas and all three were good but the inferna was the best flavor, yet it wasn't that spicy.  For our mains, I got one of the lunch specials--turkey mole enchiladas.  The enchiladas were spread inside with a thin layer of very good masa.  The enchiladas were covered with an almond mole that was complex in flavor and very good.  The enchiladas were filled with well seasoned turkey meat and there was a small frisee salad on top with some very thin fresh peach slices.   My wife got the carnitas tacos.  There were three soft tacos with two kinds of rice and some black beans with cotija cheese.  I ate one of the tacos and the pork and toppings were very good.  The chipotle salsa was very good.  We waited for awhile and then ordered two half desserts.  They allow you two pick two desserts and get a half portion of each.  We got the pastel Rufina.  The menu describes it this way:  layers of puff pastry, sweetened cream cheese, chocolate chunks, and fresh berries.  The berries were raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries and the dessert is made with eclair-like puff pastry and topped with the cream cheese and chocolate chunks.  It was superb!  The other selection was a small wedge of their flourless chocolate truffle cake. The menu describes it as rich, delicate chocolate truffle cake with prickly pear lychee sauce and raspberries.  The chocolate is very rich in flavor but it is not delicate.  It was very dense although very tasty.  Service was good although we waited for a time to get an iced tea refill.  I really like Border Grill and I'll be back.",

Having checked other menus in surrounding restaurants, it was decided that Border Grill would best fight the hanger beast that was about to rampage through Mandalay Bay.  I'm so relieved we went here. For the price, we got plenty of food. We had checked in awn yelp and got the fancy appetizer you get (fo freeeeee) along with some chips and salsa that helped make us more level headed so that we could order the real stuff.  We went for the burrito that was on special. The waiter (who was totally phenomenal) suggested it. Short rib if I'm not mistaken. It was excellent! Plenty for one person, or enough for two if you also split an appetizer.   Our food came out really fast. I don't know if it's because the waiter feared for his life (you know, the hanger monster rears it's ugly head), but we didn't wait longer than 5-10 minutes tops.  Would totally suggest to anyone.",

The Good: The chips and salsa are good. The food quality is decent.   The Bad:  - Food Portions: Very small portions. $19 for 3 small street tacos. $26 for the Poblano Enchiladas (3 small enchiladas and no sides of beans/rice).  - Tap Water Charge: We found out when we got the bill that they charged us $1.00 for tap water?!! We didn't dispute the water charge, but what restaurant does that?! - Receipt: The receipt didn't reflect the name of our service. His name definitely wasn't \"Sarah\". - Cold Coffee:  We order a cup of coffee (and we didn't order ice coffee) and it came out luke warm with spoiled milk. Sent it back. - Menu Misrepresented: When ordering I asked the server if the tacos were street tacos or full size tacos. He very clearly said they were full size and made a gesture with his hands that they were big. When the tacos came out they were street tacos. The employee who delivered the meal confirmed they were street tacos. When I asked the server he wanted to argue that the tacos weren't street tacos. One of the managers came over to discuss our concerns and she wanted to make sure she pointed out the tacos were bigger than regular street tacos, but stated they were still street tacos. The taco quality was good, but definitely misrepresented by the restaurant staff. The misrepresentation on the front-end was the real issue. Would I go back?:  I would not go back.  Management: After we left the restaurant I noticed that the manager had discounted the meal by $6. We didn't ask for a discount and no one said they were sorry for our service or the misrepresentation. The discount for $6 just showed up on the ticket without a comment.",

We stopped in for lunch and fortunately made a reservation because they filled up in no time right after opening. The waitress was very pleasant and delightful. Almost everything in here is gluten free which made it very easy for my wife. They do provide complimentary chips and salsa which was very enjoyable. The chipotle salsa might be my favorite. The plantain empandas were fantastic, I could have eaten ten. My wife and I each had two tacos for lunch, brisket and fish. Both were so different from each and both amazing. The rice and black beans were delightful as well. We enjoyed our food so much we had to indulge in the flour less chocolate cake which as you can imagine was perfect. It came with a very nice almond ice cream, candied almonds and a thin slice of banana that was fried and nice and crunchy. Oh and yes they have great cocktails here as well. I wish this place was closer to my home.",

The service here was incredibly fast, it was almost scary. They bring out chips and several salsas when you first arrive, but you could ask for an extra spicy one that will really make you sweat.   When you check-in, you get complimentary corn tamales. They were ridiculously sweet and I personally would have liked them more for dessert, but I usually don't eat tamales so maybe you have to get used to the taste.   I had one of the best quesadillas here. The tortilla was fresh and handmade, the cheese was perfectly melty, and the vegetables like zucchini completed the dish very well.  However, the enchiladas were bland and overpriced, and I really expected more. Even though it comes drenched in this green sauce, I feel like they forgot to add any sort of spices, or even salt and pepper.  On top of that, it was the most expensive thing we ordered and was not filling at all.   We finished off with \"milk and cookies\". The milk is actually a rich, thick, vanilla ice cream which was amazing, but the cookies aren't traditional chocolate chip.  The service here was friendly and fast, so 5 stars for that but the food itself disappointing.",

Our waitress was very attentive and extremely knowledgeable of the menu also had great suggestions to give to the entire table. For myself I went and ordered the $55 all you can eat small plates course to say the least this was a fantastic move by myself. Everything I ate was extremely well prepared had many different flavors all flavors were very clean and all harmonize together in a certain way. I walked out of that restaurant absolutely stuffed but also knew that I tried several different items to get a feel of the entire menu. The bonus of having this meal was knowing that while I am paying a Vegas premium price I'm getting a premium meal. I would recommend this for anybody with a big appetite that is willing to try things outside of the box. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody. Just keep in mind that you are paying for a Vegas meal on the strip so the prices will be inflated to Vegas pricing.",

Business takes me to the Mandalay Bay convention center often, and the Border Grill is one of the few celebrity restaurants here (featuring two Top Chef alumni) that provides consistent quality at a price that doesn't send your jaw dropping to the table when the bill arrives. Fresh, refined Mexican cuisine, with familiar items for the less adventurous and plenty of intrigue for foodie types. Also a great bar with fantastic sangria.",

    "text": "Leading up to my trip to Vegas, I was very excited to try this restaurant. I, like everyone, had seen the two chefs that own this restaurant on Top Chef Masters, and their food looks so good! I went here on Monday for lunch, sat outside overlooking the pool, which was very nice, but was halfway disappointed. SO I had ordered the Border Grill Classics (I think that's what it was called), but it had little mini portions of chicken tacos, green corn tamales, and a tostada -ish thing with a funky name (can't remember right now), and it was just so boring! I was shocked that something that was supposed to give a taste of multiple menu items was just bland and not exciting AND cost 19$...not cool. Now, on the flip side, the BF got the potato tacos and they were one of the most delicious things I have tasted. They were spicy, creamy AND crunchy (fried shell), and had a ton of flavor. It came with two different types of rice, green and red, which were both good also. All of this for 16$! I really made the wrong choice... Anyway, I might have given this place 4 stars, but our service was not so great. Our server, Erica, seemed like she was in a very bad mood and talked to our table with attitude, especially after we declined drinks or appetizers.   I would think about going back here for the potato tacos....but I wish it was a bit more consistent.",

The service was lackluster, not terrible, just nothing special. Any drinks ordered seemed to take some time before coming to the table. Everyone ordered a different meal from the menu.   The food was nothing to write home about. Our appetizers came out timely, some melted cheese & chips. Then came entree. It was $30 for three small tacos that were not very impressive. Finally, the desert. A very bland banana cream pie.   I'd give this place another shot. There were some other choices on the menu I'd like to try some time.",

First off the patio is so cool overlooking the lazy river pool; one of the nicest pools in Vegas btw....perfect breeze, lovely day and fantastic service.   It is an all you can eat and there is a long list of tapas from which to choose from. I tried about 3/4's of the list and each one that came out just got better and better. Far too many to mention just try them all you will not be disappointed. My faves were the empanadas, skirt steak and the potato tacos....wow!!! What a refreshing concept to the typical brunch.

The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the restaurant itself is very very nice. The chips? Terrible.  It comes in a tiny tin jar so you can't even get a good amount when you dip the over-cooked chips. The water they give you tastes exactly like tap water (maybe even toilet water- not that I would know). The main course I had was cheese enchillada and I have honestly never had an enchillada that looked like a pancake and tasted like throw up- until now. The rice that they provide (OH WAIT they actually charge you $5 for the rice but don't tell you) tastes like it was Uncle Bens that was made in a microwaveable pouch. The alcoholic beverages are also tiny and over priced (but was probably the highlight of the meal)  Needless to say $85 for a crappy meal isn't worth it",

We didn't really order anything specifically; instead, we had the waitress just continue to recommend and put in certain dishes for us to try and it worked perfectly.

The machaca chilaquiles were wonderful, as well as their eggs Benedict. When you get the brunch though, be prepared to eat a LOT of eggs.  I think it was about $30 per person, but it was good quality food. For another...$8 I think, you can add bottomless mimosas.

We shared the Kobe Beef Sopes, Watercress salad and Tecate Carnitas. We told the waiter that we had a late buffet lunch and will order a few dishes to share. He seems to be very concern that we did not order enough food and kept asking if we want to order more. This made us felt uncomfortable.  First to come was the Kobe Beef Sopes. It was tiny piece of beef wrapped in two quarter size corn masa topped with mango red cabbage mint slaw. The slaw was well seasoned and very tasty. However, I can really taste much of the beef since it was so small.  Next, we had the Watercrest, Jaicama and Orange Salad. The salad was topped with 4 little bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese. The salad was very ordinary and the bacon wrapped dates were salty.  Lastly, we had the Tecate Carnitas. They gave us a good portion of the carnitas for this dish. However, the taste and quality of the roast pork is very mediocre. It is like the carnitas you get from an ordinary Mexican restaurant. There was only one piece tortilla came with the dish and it was all dried and cracked. It was not something that I expected a high end restaurant would serve to its diner.  When our bill came at the end of our meal, we found that there was $1 charge for  tap water in addition to the our  other drinks. We dinned at many fine restaurants in Las Vegas and never have anyone charge for tap water.",

    "text": "I ate dinner here on September 27, 2008. I had heard about the restaurant from my boss, who said it was a must-visit during my trip (he'd only been to the Santa Monica restaurant).  Great service.  Food was ok. My boyfriend and I had eaten lunch at the Bellagio Buffet earlier in the day so we didn't get into the restaurant until around 10pm. Neither of us was very hungry, but we did need to eat something.  We got guacamole for an appetizer. For the amount of guac, the appetizer was fairly overpriced. I've also made guacamole at home that was better than this stuff.  My boyfriend got a quesadilla off of the appetizers section, which had chicken and several Mexican cheeses in it. He thought it was delicious.  I got the watercress, avocado, and orange salad. I don't eat meat, and so my boyfriend ate the bacon off of the dates so that I could include them in the salad's taste profile (even though the bacon taste lingered...). I blame myself for completely not noticing that there was bacon in the description... so no blame with the server or kitchen there.  The dressing was wayyyyy thick in the salad, to the point where I asked if they could make me a new one with dressing on the side. The dressing was also a very weird flavor profile. Lots of black pepper and sour/saltiness that just sort of overwhelmed everything else in the bite. I didn't even taste coriander, just sour/salty/peppery grossness.  The server was very accommodating about the dressing, and had a new salad ready pretty fast.  I had a delicious coconut lemonade, which was the highlight of the meal for me. My boyfriend had a watermelon mojito, which was ok, but he commented that the fresh mint was strangely overpowering the watermelon flavor, which he wasn't sure combined well with the mint.  We also had the Tres Leches cake boxed up for us so we could eat it later, and it was delicious.",

Due to the economy, Mandalay in general and BG specifically were a ghost town this past Friday. It was kinda depressing.  2. I prefer Mexican restaurants that are rundown, that serves you margaritas by the pitcher.  However there are faults with the service and food of the actual restaurant:  1. We ordered the Queso Fundido. Never got it. 2. I asked for my margarita without salt. It of course came with salt. 3. My scallops were very sour.",

Maybe because I live in San Diego and have lived in Tucson - both places with exceptional, traditional Mexican fare. But, Border Grill is outside the Convention Center at Mandalay Bay, so I end up there when at abrade shows.  And the food never disappoints.  The house made tortilla chips come with three delicious salsas. Addicting. Fresh, crunchy and perfectly salty. The salsas are insanely good - very flavorful.  I had the flank steak which was so very good. Perfectly seared, perfectly sliced, perfectly cooked (medium rare). Came with a tasty corn relish (vert good) and black beans (which were just okay). My friend had a quesadilla, which seemed pretty basic, but which he inhaled.  The service was great, the food perfect. Great job, ladies! Two stars off because, as others have mentioned, it was overpriced. Way overpriced.",

I usually prefer it for lunch (or the take out counter for an in-room or at the MB beach treat) - and the outside patio is very beautiful.  The portions are very large, and they serve great salads, gauc, and holy moly - the tamales are the best!  Try the sangria or a house margarita - and as a side note, if you do take out they will put your drink in a To-Go cup (gotta love that :)  We have always had great service - I would highly recommend this spot if you are staying in Mandalay Bay (or somewhere nearby) as a delicious, reasonably priced spot with great food and drink.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of friends on a trip to Vegas and was thoroughly disappointed.  We were expecting a nicer Mexican restaurant considering the prices and food discriptions - but I was less than wowed.  While the waitstaff was nice, the service was very slow.  We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks.  Dinner wasn't great either.  I had the Mexican Chopped Salad which is supposed to include red peppers, tomato, apple, beans, onion, corn, avacado and lettuce.  When they brought it to me I literally thought it was the wrong dish because all I could see was lettuce and chicken.  There were no apples or peppers and a sprinking (I mean like 10 kernals) of corn and beans.  It was laughable and NOT worth $17.  2 girls ordered the Turkey Tostada, which was a cute presentation on two small corn tortillas, but they complained that the turkey was overwhelmingly salty, and avoided it all together.  Others liked the quesadillas and drinks were good, which is why I give this review 1-2 stars.  Had the menu been more appropriately priced I wouldn't have been as annoyed - but I could have found a MUCH better meal for $30 somewhere else.    Who knew a head of lettuce and a glass of wine could eat up so much money!? ... I should've put it into slot machines, that would've been less of a throw away :)",

We were seated quickly and the waitress was super nice and very helpful. The layout was nice, but from my seat, I was staring out the door to what I think was a patio, lots of sun to blind me, and I didn't see any sun shades.   We got the guacome to start. It was very authentic and tasted fresh and delicious. The chips were fresh and had a great flavor.   My wife had a Sangria. She thought it was a little watery.  But, not being a drinker, the alcohol snuck up a little. I had a chelada. The lime was a little overwhelming, but good.    I ordered the skirt steak. It was seasoned perfect and cooked awesome. I loved it. The mole sauce on side was great.  It came with one giant handmade tortilla. So wonderful. It rocked.   My wife had the short rib enchiladas. She said they were good, but did not rave about them.   For dessert we got the banana cream pie. Get it. That's all I am saying. It was a little pricey but really good.",

    "text": "Was at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center and instead of eating at the food court, I wanted something a bit better.  Border Grill is actually in between the convention center and the casino so decided to check out Vegas's location.  The place was pretty packed, thanks to the convention crowds.  Originally I wanted to grab a seat at the bar since I was by myself, but Vegas was storming, so the end of the bar was actually wet from water leaking from the roof!  Mandalay Bay definitely was showing its age... but I was able to grab a small table at the bar area without waiting thanks to one of the really friendly waitress!  I've been the LA's Border Grill a few times, but only for happy hour so I was pretty excited to check out the regular menu.  Asked the waiter what his favorite was and went with the Carne Asada Quesedilla.  It's essentially their carne asada, with several types of cheeses.  It's not the best carne asada I've had, but the beef was good.  Quality's good and I like how the tortilla is crunchy.  I wish it was cheesier but the pico de gallo and the guac goes very well with the quesedilla!  If you want to add rice & beans, it's an additional $4 on top of the $18 for the quesedilla.  A little pricey for quesedilla, but the quality's good.  Food alone, it probably was a little average, but the service was great, from the waitress that helped me at the beginning, to my server.  They definitely need to fix the leaking problem though :P",

The gf and I were at a poker party where we met a new foodie friend that gave high praise to the Border Grill weekend Brunch.  We decided to give it a try.  It costs $29 / person but locals get 15% off.  The added champagne option costs a reasonable $5.  You order from a special \"tapas\" menu and the plates are brought to you - all you can eat.  We did our best to get through all the options on the menu but not even close.    The highlights:  The mexican chocolate chip pancakes the churro tots the banana bread french toast The sausage biscuit/gravy The pbjc ( peanut butter jelly and bacon ) - AWESOME Shrimp and grits - AWESOME Chicken enchilada ( the sauce was amazing) mexican eggs Benedict  Ok :  The sweet corn tamales the short rib hash ( will be much better if served with an over easy egg instead of the provided scrambled eggs )  chilaquiles empanadas  Service was excellent and we enjoyed speaking to Chef Mike when he made the rounds in the dining room  WE ARE COMING BACK !",

We ordered their famous watermelon lemonade and peach lemonade and both were GREAT!  The watermelon one is a little better though.  They do pour you distilled water and they leave the carafe at your table so you can refill your water if you need to.  But they charge for it tough...it was only a $1.00 if I remember correctly so it's not a big deal.  We ordered the guacamole, tortilla soup, green tamales, and an order of their steak enchiladas.  Everything was FANTASTIC!  The food is so flavorful and they use fresh and exotic ingredients.  Also the waitress knew that we were splitting everything so she had everything split into two dishes...a really nice touch.  The bill wasn't cheap though.  I think we spent around $85.00 including tip but it was well worth it.  I love you Border Grill!!!",

Their beans had the texture of baby food and all of our food was barely room temp. We had fish tacos and carne asada tacos at the recommendation of our waitress, they were dry and flavorless. The chips and salsa were ho hum. We sat on the patio which was a great view. The margaritas (we had a house and a skinny) were very good. Bottom line, go for a drink, but save your $$$ and don't eat the food. Total bummer since they have such a strong reputation.",

I was looking for something light and ordered a ceasars with no meat and a side of black beans. With tip left at $17. Servings are huge. Chips and salsa the best; fresh, not too thick, not too salty, and whoever made  the salsa deserves a medal. How can I make (all three) at home?

Border Grill is a VERY refreshing alternative. People complain about the prices, but considering all the other restaurants in that wing are $59 pre-fixe... it's all relative.   Tucked a bit farther away towards the convention center, it was MUCH less crowded than other dining options in the area. Our service was excellent, and the food just as good as their location in Santa Monica, CA.   The Sweet Corn Tamales and Ceviche were excellent.

But in its delivery, a few stumbles - or at least lapses.  Service was very friendly and cheerful, but promises of 'chips n salsa on its way', 'more water', 'more iced tea', or 'your check' were either followed by a lengthy delay or just never happened. Usually forgiveable when a place is slammed, but this place was near dead and amply staffed, so there was nothing more we could attribute to it other than flakiness.  But damn those grilled fish tacos made it all worth it",

The black cherry mojito was a refreshing signature drink. I had the chicken enchiladas and ate the whole thing a long with some of my friend's tacos. Everything was delicious!  The service was great and we even joined their locals discounts club which I'll actually come back and use. Be careful of the tortilla chips served at the beginning.

Because we were a party of 25, I reserved a private room and worked with the event coordinator on a pre-set menu.  That in itself was a lovely experience.  The event coordinator was infinitely patient with my constant additions to and subtractions from the number of the party and happily accommodated one of my guests, who was battling morning sickness and could only eat certain foods, by letting me order a special entree for her that was not on our pre-set menu, at no extra charge.   The coordinator's nearly-angelic patience extended to the staff.  No one even blinked an eye or cracked a frown when 90% of our dinner party showed up almost an hour late for our reservation!  And the food was absolutely spectacular!  The chips came out crackling hot and the green salsa was so fresh that I could swear I caught a whiff of the grass from the field where the vegetables were grown! (presuming, that is, that vegetables for salsa are grown in a field, which they are probably not, but I digress...)  Our starter was a Caesar salad, which was really really flavorful.  We had a selection of three main courses - the grilled skirt steak, the chicken poblano enchiladas and the chille relleno.  The skirt steak was juicy, tender and really well seasoned.  The enchiladas had a delicious spicy sauce.  I didn't try the chille relleno, but it looked great.  For dessert, we had fresh berries with mint and whipped cream, which came in cute little yummy edible baskets.   I also highly recommend the house-made peach lemonade.    Overall, an absolutely fantastic experience - highly, highly recommend!",

And while the food is probably a four star, I give it 5 stars for a few combined reasons. The food is pretty good, the drinks are great, but it is the uniqueness and the total package that this place offers that keeps me coming back.   These two Hot Tamales have taken certain aspects of the Mexican menu that you rarely get to see in the states and thrown them into this package of casual dining that is absolutely fantastic. It's not your typical run of the mill restaurant. The tortillas are freshly made as is the salsa. The green habanero salsa is my favorite and one of the best I've ever had. And I know my salsa. Don't get it twisted!  You'll find several dishes that you may find in some better restaurants in Mexico along with well executed traditional favorites. You won't see the slop of beans and rice that you see in most Mexican places that are actually run by Mexican families. That stuff to me is not good. I'd rather see more unique flavors that I'm familiar with but you don't traditionally see in restaurants. Needless to say, Border Grill keeps me coming back again, and again.",

The menu is quite accommodative and the dishes are very tasty. Not being as pricy as most strip restaurants is an added bonus. They charge $0.50 per person for water....not the greatest thing, but in the Vegas frame of mine, I will not let it bother me. Ask questions to make sure you know what it is on your plate.

While most of the reviews i've since read complain about the quality of the food matched with the high prices for Mexican food, I actually found this to be a respite from what we had become accustomed to during our stay. For once, I thought the two nearly equaled each other, although again, we've had much better.  Had the fish tacos which were fine. The fish was grilled nicely, no bones, fresh cole-slaw on top. Nothing to really complain about. GF had some kind of pork sandwich which looked messy. She didn't seem too impressed as she didn't finish it and avoided the bread entirely. Good drinks to start (nice to see 'Chelada' on the menu) accompanied by warm, fresh chips and three types of salsa. Should have just stuck with that combo.  What really distracted me from the experience once again was the service! This time it was the hostess. We were greeted and when I asked if we could sit outside she said she had 'nothing outside'. OK, well can we wait? I asked. Irritated glance and pissy attitude in full display, we were told we could wait at the bar. Fine by me. Then when she came by not 7 minutes later, she asked if I had settled my bill with the bartender, as if we were the ones holding her up.  To top it off, she seated us at the back of the patio when there were many more tables that had just been cleared which overlooked the pool area. It later became apparent that she was either holding these tables for friends or for those who were willing to shell out for the extended service. Oh, and she didn't give us menus. The waitress had to go back and get them. Nice job.",

    "text": "Border Grill's chips were excellent, two of the four salsas were good; we requested hot and we like the tomatillo. Our $49 meal deal from travelzoo came with house margaritas that weren't very good. We had an appetizer platter (chosen for us) to start. It had taquitos, empanadas, and sweet corn tamale. The taquitos were the best, we only wished we had known they were coming because my husband ordered the entree so he was stuck with more of the same. I had beer battered fish tacos which were tasty. I liked that they lacked the creamy slaw that so many places like to add. For dessert, we shared Tres Leche cake. It was drier than those I've had before, but still good. Service was attentive, but the overall meal was just ok. I'm glad we got it at a discount, but I see no reason to return.",

The chicken was cooked perfectly - crispy skin and juicy on the inside. I'm a big fan of Mary Sue and Susan, so I will visit their restaurants any chance I get. So far, I have not been disappointed.",

    "text": "This is hard for me to write because I have been dining at Border Grill for years, but the last few have been a disappointment, and the last meal made me realize that I just need to give up trying.   I was just in Vegas for four days and ended up eating here twice as my friend enjoyed our first meal so much.   Lunch - For lunch our server was fantastic. He was very informative and passionate about the menu. We were given the full explanation of the 5x filtered water and the $0.50 per head fee. The chips and salsas arrived and were fantastic as usual. Our mains arrived - carne asada tacos and the Baja fish tacos. Both were delicious and we left with full bellies and smiles. The downside is that the bill presented to us had no section to charge it to our room. We queried and were told to take it to the MLife desk, which made no sense but we figured their process had changed since last time.   Dinner - Our server never told us his name. We never got the explanation about the water or advised of the fee. The tortilla chip serving was smaller than lunch. The drinks were watered down compared to other meal we had (and every other time I have ordered it). I asked for the server's opinion regarding a few dishes. He emphatically directed me to the special, so I ordered it. My friend ordered the brisket taquitos. I was seriously underwhelmed with my dish. It was like fancy fajita served with one tortilla, and the meat lacked any flavour. The brisket taquitos were also a let down and the portion was smaller than at lunch. The inconsistency was mind boggling.  Once again we were presented a bill with no place to fill in a room charge so we took it as it was definitely a new process.   After repeated let downs, I truly cannot in good faith return again.",

Even though there was a slip up (I noticed and didn't eat) they immediately made it right the manager came over and made sure I was okay and hadn't eaten any that would lead me to get sick and assured me she would find out where the mess up was as they have strict policies in place when dealing with allergies to prevent this. I'm very happy to report after it was remade  I was able to safely eat here and not get sick for the first time on my trip to Vegas. We will definitely come back the next time we're in town! Thank you for an amazing meal and service! You have no idea how rare and difficult this is for me. I greatly appreciate it! There was even dairy free desert options!",

From the pictures you may be able to figure out what I got but just Incase you cant, I got the skirt steak which is my favorite item here and I will be honest it might be the best skirt steak I ever have ordered, I've gotten it a dozen times over the last 10 years.   But everything is good, chips and salsa and guacamole is a must.  They offer sparking water as house water which is a nice change compared to what restaurants do nowadays.  They used to offer about a dozen house made Sorbets but they are down to 4 in the winter.  If you're at the Mandalay Bay I suggest coming here for lunch they also have a great brunch.",

    "text": "My dad and I were staying at Mandalay Bay and we were starving so we didn't want to leave the hotel to try and find something to eat. We saw this place on their map and decided to give it a try. Man, am I glad we did! Everything we tried here was delicious! We received some green corn tamales that had a hint of sweetness and served with sour cream and salsa Fresca. They had so much flavor and you have to eat them with those two sides. It just makes everything pop!   Then they brought out the chips and salsa and we were more impressed! I loved the salsa Verde the best but the chipotle salsa was yummy too. We decided if those two things were any indication of how the rest of our meal would be, we were in for a treat.   I ordered the al pastor tacos and my dad got the Asado Norteno chicken. Again, both were delicious!! The taco meat had so much flavor. My complaint with street tacos is the fact that sometimes they can be dry if you don't drown them in salsa. These were served with an avocado crema and pineapple salsa so they didn't need any additional flavoring. My dad's chicken was crispy and flavorful on the outside but still moist on the inside.   Our server was fantastic, helpful, and friendly. Needless to say, we left with full, happy bellies and would not hesitate to recommend this place to ofhe",

They have an option for unlimited small plates and unlimited mimosas and bloody Mary's for two hours. The food are very small plates but it's perfect because you get to try a bunch of different food and they bring the food out quick and you can order more than one at a time.   The chips & salsa they brought out first was very good. I had the steak & eggs,chicken & waffles,Eggs Benedict,and the shrimp and grits. I have 0 complaints about any of the food because it was all delicious.  The mimosas were good because they had many various flavors to select from. Our waitress was bringing them out 1 at a time but we had a group of 7 so we kept refilling pretty quick so she accommodated us and starting bringing pitchers of mimosas for us.  5 Star food,5 Star drinks,and 5 stars service.",

Border Grill is a perfect combo of those two.  The food is amazing. While we've gone to dinner here, most often it's lunch -- a perfect spot to get a break from the relentless heat and pool scene. My husband loves the various ceviches. I like to explore the entire menu.  It's been our good fortune to be served by Michelle the last couple of years -- so nice, so helpful, such an all-smiles, friendly face to see every year. And I thank her for introducing me to the sweet corn tamale, which I immediately ordered the next day.  The great food keeps us interested in coming back.

The atmosphere is fantastic with an ambiance that is modern, stylish, and welcoming.  The service is professional, friendly, and responsive.    Our dinner began with appetizers on the patio.  Each course came with shots and cocktails and each was distinctive, strong, and delicious. The appetizers were creative and masterfully prepared. The standouts were the ceviche, caviar canapes, and the beef cheek sopes. The beet salad featured locally procured seed greens with an excellent cheese and pumpkin based dressing that was unlike any I've experienced before.   The best of fusion and modern Mexican cooking takes the best qualities of Mexican cooking and adds creative, adventurous, delicious touches to create something new and bold. The next four main entrees were classic examples of great fusion/modern Mexican food. The standouts to me were the bone-in shortrib in an addictive chili reduction and the lamb chop covered in a sumptuous pumpkin seed mole. The meat in both dishes was tender, flavorful, and juicy.  The hamachi crudo and duck carnitas were excellent as well. The dinner ended with a flourless chocolate almond cake accented by ice cream, fudge, bananas, and nuts. Chief Mike Minor introduced and explained each dish, clearly demonstrating his passion, mastery, and love of cooking. As I shared with the chief I have not had such an excellent meal since frequenting the Brennan family restaurants in New Orleans years ago.",

Basically the deal here is you play a flat amount (like $40) and they serve unlimited small plates. Options range from Benedicts to Chilaquiles to Chicken and Waffles to Shrimp and Grits. I will be real in that I tried almost everything and loved everything I tried!   The big standouts were the Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Eggs, and Chilaquiles. They also gave us a guava empanada which was not on the menu but was awesome!   My pro tip: when ordering don't have everyone get the same thing. Mix and match and share! Otherwise you will fill up fast!   Other pro tip: make a reservation. We got there at 11am which was a tad early for brunch there but by 1pm it was packed in there!",

    "text": "I'm always craving tacos. Three of us stayed at the Mandalay Bay for a couple days, so naturally, this is the first restaurant that I gravitated toward.  Many others here have noted the $0.50 per person charge for water. I will say that I've never had to pay for water at any other restaurant before, however I'm glad to see that they donate the funds to a charitable cause.   I noticed on their dinner menu, they offered three different taco plates for $18 - pork, chicken and beef brisket. Being all equally priced, they allowed me to create my own sampler plate so I could try one of each, which I greatly appreciated. All of the meats were seasoned well and had great flavor, although the diced pork was unfortunately dry. The beef brisket \"taco\" turned out to be more of a taquito, rolled up and deep-fried, topped with a crunchy and zesty slaw. I loved the avocado crema on each of them which balanced out the tacos' spicy notes. Overall, I thought the tacos were filling enough on their own, but probably because I also couldn't stop eating their (complimentary) chips and salsa trio.   Sadly, my dad found his Asado Norteno Chicken entree to be extremely salty for his taste, almost like it was brined. Our waiter informed the manager who then came to our table and offered to replace his meal. He explained that the chicken was sous-vided (in other words, packed in a vacuum sealed bag then slowly cooked in a water bath), which may be an explanation for the saltiness. The manager was open to my dad's comments and I could tell he didn't want us to leave unsatisfied.   Other than that one dish, all else was fine and service was friendly and prompt. The Border Grill is not located in the heart of the Mandalay Bay, so you'll have to trek out towards the convention center. The restaurant is modern with a Spanish flair and on a nice day, you can even enjoy your meal out on the patio with a view of the pool.",

    "text": "Located inside of the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino you will find the amazing Border Grill! I can't remember the last time I paid Border Grill a visit but that experience obviously didn't come close to how well my most recent visit this past week ended up being. My friend flew in from Dallas, TX and booked a room at Mandalay so like most people who just get off the plane they want to eat right? LOL.   We both had meetings within a little over an hour so we really didn't want a restaurant that would take too long so with time being a bit of a concern I thought well let's just get something that will be casual and not too fancy. While heading towards the aquarium I spotted Border Grill and said Let's Go! The bar area was free and clear so I knew that the service here would be pretty quick, which it was thankfully. Our bartender grabbed us a few menu's and even made a few recommendations on drinks. I went with just a traditional Cadillac margarita (my favorite) on the rocks and my friend had some sort of concoction that they bartender put together with whiskey. Both of or drinks were delicious! The food options that they offer are a bit overwhelming but with the help of the bartender we quickly narrowed the selection down.  Lunch Entree's we ordered were:  Spicy Shrimp Tacos (guajillo shrimp, cucumber slaw, jicama, chipotle aioli) -$19   Fish A La Plancha (pan seared sustainable fish, avocado, citrus aioli, salsa fresca, radish, garden slaw, crema) -$18  We both traded one of each of our tacos with one another just to get a taste of both worlds and my gosh! Delicious!! I'm always done for tacos but even more so when they have some amazing seafood inside. We had a blast and really enjoyed our time here. I come to Mandalay Bay a lot so this place will be one of my new \"go-to\" spots!",

The only thing I would say, is that because we were a large party they were bringing food out nonstop \"family, share\" style. So some of the things we didn't want were brought out and some of the things we were interested in trying we didn't get a chance to try.  The bottomless mimosas are also delicious; so many flavors!!",

To start off, our server served my friend water in a cracked glass.  When we noticed and alerted her she was less than empathetic.  Throughout the meal it was almost like the server was going through mood swings.  She was nice then she was rude then she was friendly again.  Very strange.  Onto the food.  Spectacular.  The all you can eat tapas menu is phenomenal and the $10 bottomless mimosas is a must!  They have over 15 different flavors!  The French toast, steak and eggs, and breakfast fries were some of my favorites!  For dinner I had the steak quesadilla, very simple but excellent quality of steak.  One strange thing to mention though.. We ordered he fries a second time and this time they were seasoned completely different.  Kinda strange as I enjoyed them the first way better.  I absolutely will be back to try new menu items and have another great experience.",

Service: the servers were sweet but slow. However, when asking an employee where the restrooms were, she escorted me personally and was super sweet (give her 5 stars). The server actually came back to the table to say he accidentally threw away the paper he wrote on and asked for drink orders again (after 20 minutes of waiting).  Food: it started with chips and salsa, the chips were thick and there were three different kinds of salsa- hard to screw that up.  First course: organic black bean empanada- yuck!! No one likes this one Second course: kale Caesar salad, it was okay, the lettuce seemed fresh and dressing was okay. It had some kind of cheese crouton that was too salty.  Entree: you could choose between a pork dish or steak- the steak was just okay and after speaking to other guests who had the pork- yuck again!! Dessert: was the wedding cake- I don't know if they made it or bride and groom brought it in from the outside but everyone loved it",

Louis is, by far, one of the best servers I have ever experienced in a restaurant - not just in Las Vegas, where I travel to frequently, but in any restaurant I have ever eaten in.  Louis should serve as an example of exactly how your servers should treat your guests.  He is excellent and anyone thinking about dining here I'd highly recommend sitting in his section.   Absolutely positively 5* - so good we ate there two days in a row.  I had the skirt steak both days - perfectly cooked and the flavors were fantastic.  The guacamole side is a must - the perfect mix of avocado, lime and fresh pico with fresh house made tortilla chips.  SO GOOD!  The Cadillac margarita is fresh, has great flavor and they are not shy about the tequila Cointreau float.   Food - 5* Server/service {Louis} - I would give him 10* if that was an option!",

    "text": "Went here today for lunch and left disappointed. The free chips and salsa were excellent but everything else was downhill from there. They charge for water, some BS program or charity thing, if you want to contribute to a charity do it with a percentage of the already high prices don't charge me for room temperature water with no ice. We added the guac to the chips and it was tasty but expensive. Both our cocktails tasted as if it was just fruit juice. The entrees were just ok. Short rib enchiladas for $28 were not impressive. It seemed like they were prepared in mass and dished out and barely heated up. The Chile rellano  burger was ok, the burger patty seemed like a pre made frozen patty. Left disappointed especially since I forgot my pearl card and had to pay $9 for Parking as well.",

Very fair pricing here and they even had a special for massive margaritas at 1/2 price refill so you can slam margs at the lazy river and wave pool all day and come back for drinks all day long bc the giant cups are plastic. Def recommend this spot for anyone staying at the Mandalay Bay and looking to hit the pools and get sauced on some margs.",

    "text": "Was here about 4 years ago and really liked it, went back last night and had a bad experience. We planned on having dinner and drinks at the bar. We sat down and ordered 2 margaritas which both sounded good, spicy blood orange and a Blanco Margarita. Bartender asked if we wanted chips and salsa, we said yes and he pulled them out from under the bar. First bad sign. When you go to a Mexican restaurant you really should be served fresh HOT chips! It's your first impression of the place and they should put their best foot forward. Especially when they are selling 18 dollar margaritas! Speaking of margaritas, that's when things really hit the bricks. Bartender brings the drinks and just by looking at them I know something is off. I didn't know what at first. Then I took a sip and realized, they were actually warm! That's why they looked weird, no frost on the glass, no condensation on the sides. It was clear that the drinks weren't shaken and most likely came from a premixed batch. They also tasted like artificial flavoring, not fresh fruits. Again, for 18 bucks I'm going to be a little picky. Also the bathrooms are far away. You need to leave the restaurant and go downstairs in the hotel. So cold chips, warm margaritas, far bathrooms, three strikes, we're out. Check please, 36 bucks 7 dollar tip. 43 dollars down the drain for 2 sips of warm margaritas and 1cold tortilla chip. (second star is because bartender was nice enough, asked if we wanted out margaritas in to go cups.... We said no thanks! Lol)",

I opt to sit outside. The views of the pool are so perfect.   My husband and I love their tortillas and salsa! So delicious and each salsa (you get 3 to choose from) is very flavorful. Every time I go I'm not sure if I always eat the same thing but I know I'm never disappointed. My last visit I had the carne asada tacos and my husband had the chicken quesadilla. The tacos are very scrumptious and the portion size is perfect. You definitely won't be disappointed.   But let's get to the REAL showstopper here. The churro dessert. Oh my goodness! The first time I had it I had to order another because sharing it with children was just not enough to satisfy for yearning for it. This past visit I almost wanted to start with dessert so that I know for sure I've got enough room for it. The churro is cooked perfectly. It's paired with ice cream and fresh berries. It's heaven on a plate!! I cannot wait to come back.",

Everyone was so polite and had a smile on their face, form the hostess to busers.  Our waiter Daniel N. was awesome. We never had to wait for a drink or food refill and he had perfect service and we don't say that very often. He did an awesome job. We also loved the deal of paying $35 and getting unlimited tapas and the $10 bottomless mimosas of different flavors.

I am a fan but it is not so good that I would go out of my way to come over here.  With that said - the guacamole is to dieeeee.... so yummy.  Perfect for when you're starving and you still can't decide what to order and you've been at the pool/beach all day and cannot stomach another margarita.  Order it as soon as you sit down, as they are handing you the menu.  You will not regret it.  My boyfriend and I got the unlimited $45 thing they were doin' - here is my breakdown.  Tacos - just okay but I live in L.A. and we got some good tacos over there  Ceveche - good, kept getting a few of each  Whatever that salad was with the bacon wrapped date - salad was good but the date was amazeballs!  Please give more than one!  Scallop and shrimp soup - I thought it was good but my bf really complained about it.  Said the scallop was overcooked.  If you're staying at Mandalay and are flipping through your guest room book, trying to figure out what to eat and not manage to spend $100/person and maybe eat something a little better for you than another damn cheeseburger.

Every time I have visited, we have had the \"tasting menu\".  The last time I was there (last week), we noticed that the price had increased for the tasting menu by almost $10 and the menu had been revised with fewer overall options.  The tasting menu used to be in the mid $40 range per person.  This time it was $56 (I think) per person.  This is still a bargain for a tasting menu and especially for decent food in Vegas.  Yet, I was disappointed that some of my favorite dishes were gone completely from the menu.  The service has always been on point.  I really didn't like sitting in the basement this last time.  I felt so removed from the vibrance of the restaurant.  Overall, I would still return next time I am in Vegas.",

They changed the brunch menu and raised the prices and we only tried it once since and were disappointed. Being locals we decided to give it another shot though before a concert last night. It was the most bland overpriced food I've ever had. There was one vegan entree on the menu, though they use to cater to plant based eaters, and it was undercooked cauliflower and quinoa in a pan of spiced water with plain corn tortillas on the side. Worst off, it was $21 just for my cauliflower and quinoa dish. I know the strip has inflated prices but this place is ridiculous. The saddest part is how good this place use to be; we even got quotes to have our wedding there but they couldn't accommodate our planned date. So next time your looking for fresh plant based food (vegan or not) look someplace else.",

First the ceviche sampler is an option if you want to try all the ceviches on the menu. These had the right mix of acidity, fat from avocados and aoli. These dishes were well executed. Second, chicken enchilada with poblano sauce. It was the creamy poblano sauce with the right amount of heat that brought this dish to the next level.  Verdict: affordable, creative and satisfying.",

Service was good, food was not outstanding to me and drenched with sauce so I couldn't really taste the actual food. The only item I liked was the tamale. But honestly, this is overpriced (I know this is Vegas though, so whatever.)  Yay for salsa + chips though. They were good.",

    "text": "I planned  a bachelorette party (group of 5) and came here for Saturday champagne brunch - what a fantastic experience!  It was really a highlight of the day, and we had a lot of fun stuff that day.  Definitely make a reservation (like everywhere in Vegas, it seems).  The wait was long, but since I'd booked on opentable, we were seated immediately.  First, the service.  Our server (Carmie I believe) had a ton of tables, yet she checked on us frequently and never left us with empty champagne classes.  She was so sweet.  We did unlimited small plates, and she started us off with some of her favorite/the most popular dishes and then let us order anything we wanted.  Even though she was obviously super busy, she had a huge happy smile all the time, and managed to chat with us for a moment each time she stopped by.  I don't know how people like her do it.  Second, the food. It was outrageously good. I can't believe I've never had breakfast small plates before - you don't have to choose! The shrimp and grits, short rib hash, and frittata were favorites with us.  We ate like kings for a super reasonable price, in a cute location.  We were STUFFED - brunch was at noon, and none of us was hungry for dinner at 7pm.  By VEGAS standards, this place is $$ I think; by yelp's listed standard, it's $$$.  Unlimited small plates cost I think $33 per person and unlimited mimosas on top of that was $8 or $9.  Highly recommend this place.",

The food is pretty good. I would recommend the sweet corn tamale and the potato rojas taco.   On my blog (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.dplumly.com&s=68151719d4d0036d8607b3c3eab41301a8d5cba0d89c1f413afd09142e968d40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wordpress.dplumly.com</a>), I wrote a full critique of all the dishes that we tried.   For Vegas, I think its a pretty good deal.   TIP - It opens around 10 for brunch and ends around 3 on Saturdays and Sundays. We came at 2:30 and the kitchen closed down on us so we didn't necessarily get to try everything and they \"ran out\" of champagne. I highly recommend getting there early and planning to spend your morning/afternoon eating and drinking away.",

    "text": "This review is for Sunday brunch menu. Came here on the recommendation of our server from Verandah when we were there for RW. Brunch is my favorite meal, and this was so disappointing.  We had a reservation for the patio, which was basically a fully covered seating area with one half of it open, wouldn't exactly call it a patio. The brunch menu is tapas style, all you can eat for $29.99, and you can add bottomless mimosas for $5. There was about 18 items on the menu, and since there was 3 of us we decided to just try everything and go down the menu. Brunch was started with fresh fruit that was drizzled with some kind of mango sauce and also guava empanadas (fresh fruit would have been great without the sauce on top). I started noticing a theme after the first 4 dishes came out. Everything was so sweet and heavily sauced. The Green Corn Tamale was so sweet each of us could only handle two bites, the Mexican Rice Pudding Parfait (I love rice pudding) was so overpowered my the taste of cinnamon it wasn't edible. The Bacon Jalapeno PBJ intrigued me, I am really into wierd food combinations, this was basically Jiffy PB & grape jelly thrown on a biscuit. No points. The Peruvian Shrimp & Grits I was excited about as well, but the grits were stuck together and hard like they had been sitting prepared for awhile. The Yucatan Eggs Benedict had shredded pork, again I we tasted was cinnamon, we asked if there was a mole sauce on it and our waitress said no, it was what the meat was marinated in. I came to the conclusion that the ingredients they use were sub par, so having to marinate the meats to cover the meat is what they do. Pork shouldn't need a lot of added marinate. The only item that the 3 of us actually finished was the Skirt Steak & Egg and the Huevos Rancheros. Pretty bad odds out of 18 dishes. On to the $5 bottomless mimosas, I should have known not to go there, they offered 5 different flavors to add to the champagne, we each tried them and couldn't finish any. I mean I know they aren't serving PJ but rather Korbel....I had the worst headache for the rest of the day after that crap. Have you ever felt so gross and swollen and lethargic after eating a terrible meal? Well this is exactly how I felt.  If you're looking for a Spanish style brunch, check out Firefly's brunch.",

The unlimited food is quite tasty and the bottomless champagne mixtures (mimosa, pomegranate, peach, prickly pear, watermelon, blood orange, strawberry, etc-- try them all if you can!) are very fun.  Although not a traditional breakfast food, be sure to order the BBQ sliders- delish!  Best of all, the prices aren't bad and the view over the Mandalay Bay pool \"lazy river\" is pretty nice as well.

We shopped all around the strip at various hotels and chose Mandalay Bay. We wanted to have the reception within walking distance. Reading other reviews about various venues had us concerned and since we weren't spending a brazillion dollars we were given peasants' treatment. We decided to check out Border Grill and it we just couldn't say no. All in all we have to thank the manager Destiny for making it a wonderful experience without issue.  Fast forward a year later, the experience was right on the mark. We had Alicia as our server who was the right amount of attentive, the orders were turned around quick and service with a genuine smile.  The entrees are well priced and delicious. The skirt steak and goucho steak were two items I have tried and liked the best. I prefer mine a little rare and the seasoning was just right. Expect a hint of char. My wife had the chicken chilaquiles which were delightful - highly recommended.  Their signagure drinks are the house-infused margaritas and sangrias. All are fantastic. And let's not forget dessert. I am a big fan of the tres leches cake. A year later I am trying to find a way to replicate it.  In summary - the price is great for the high-level service and quality of food/drink. I can't recommend Border Grill enough.",

We arrived and were ok with the long wait as there was room at the bar for us to sit, have drinks and grab a few bites before being seated. We waited at the bar over 45 minutes watching everyone else get food, drinks, etc except for us even after we ordered. When they told us our table would be ready soon, we cancelled our order and asked to just get waters and STILL couldn't even get that.   Thank goodness we were seated in Ambers section. She was warm and bubbly and took her time to orient us to the brunch menu. She did an AMAZING job of making recommendations and was very attentive. We all left with a full belly and smiles on our faces. We would definitely return but we wouldn't count on getting any service at the bar.",

As we approached the hostess, she said they had happy hour at the bar.....SCORE!!!!! 1/2 price margaritas. Wooooo hoooo, me loves me some ritas! We are starting off fantastic. The bartender came over very quickly for our drink order. I ordered the happy hour margarita and in a jiff, he came and delivered. Talk about fast! They barely had time to drop off the complimentary chips and salsa! It was not the best margarita. Maybe its' because I make my own with fresh squeezed lime juice, I make my own simple syrup and I add a Grand Marnier floater. This was lacking. I didnt taste any alcohol at all. Boooooo! We ordered the (me) veggie quesidilla, and my friend the carne asada. The presentation on both was so pretty (see pics). The flavor on the veggie quesidilla was good. I didn't like the \"fried\"/crunchy feeling of the flour tortilla. I'd ask next time for it just warmed up, but that's me. It reminded me of taco bell and I dont eat there. The guacamole and salsa on the side were very delish. I enjoyed those tremendously. My friend really enjoyed her tacos too.  I'm glad I tried, and I might be back, but it's not a \"have to\" place for me. There is a total divey place (name I can't remember) on Durango and Westside that has great Mexican food. It's worth the drive in my opinion. This place is like most places on the strip, flashy and expensive.",

Some favorites: Bananas Foster crepes, fried chicken with a blue corn waffle and spicy mango sauce, egg white oysters rockefeller, anything with the bacon (it was awesome, thick and crispy without being overdone).  You can order multiples of the same dish if you like it (oh you can bet we did this).  I think I had three of the egg white oysters....  Between three of us, I think we ordered almost everything on the menu (to share) and left stuffed.  We were less impressed with the red velvet johnny cake and the churro tots, but loved everything else.",

    "text": "Because we were staying at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, I had read up extensively on the restaurants within the area. Border Grill had gotten rave reviews and sounded like my kind of restaurant, given my love for Mexican food and restaurants with rave reviews :).  It was a nice day and we sat out on the patio area, though there really is no view unless you have one of the seats on the very outside.. then you would be able to overlook the Mandalay Bay beach and lazy river area, though I'm not sure it would have been much of a view either way.  I ordered the Grilled Skirt Steak (also referred to as their \"marinated skirt steak\") based on positive reviews from my fellow Yelpers. For $24, it's a little pricey for what it is outside of Vegas, but it does come with a pretty generous serving of steak. Also comes with tortillas, sides of corn, tomatoes, and baked beans (forgive me if I did not describe them in fancy terms.. if you want that, you can check the menu on their website). The food is delicious and very flavorful, definitely characteristic of \"upscale Mexican.\"  My girlfriend got the Duck Tacos at $19, which comes with the same sides of corn, tomatoes, and baked beans. The duck tacos are relatively small, but I did get a taste of the duck and it was very good. My girlfriend didn't think they were anything special, but she is definitely more food snob than I (sorry babe, but it's True!).  If this review were just up to the food, I would give Border Grill 4 stars. However, service was NOT good. Our waitress was just never around, and that alone can shift the mood of the dining experience drastically. The waitress took our order while we continued to look over the drink menu, but was then never to be seen again until after our food came out. Because of this, we never got to order our drinks. And guess what, she never checked on us again until we were done eating. And damnit, the restaurant was not even busy!!  Because of lackluster service and $1 for regular water (what, you couldn't throw free water with a $50 lunch?), I am giving Border Grill 3 stars. If service had been just average, I'd of given Border Grill 4 stars. And if service was excellent, 4.5 (nice atmosphere).  Check out my photos for pics of the food.",

    "text": "Border Grill - Mandalay Bay  Our last night in Las Vegas, we decided to take a stroll over to Mandalay Bay and have dinner at Border Grill. This place was highly recommended on the gluten free sites and showed on their website to have a dedicated gluten free menu, so needless to say I was pumped to check it out.   The hostess was not very friendly. I gotta say that I am a stickler for happy, positive employees because they are the face of your business and crucial to customer satisfaction.   I was pleased to see such a large gluten free menu until I opened it and realized 2 of the pages were filled with alcohol choices.   We decided to try the Queso Fundido, which they brought out with corn tortillas and the chips are gluten free there. The dip was pretty tasty for sure but it didn't knock my socks off.   Our waiter was aware of celiac disease and gluten free preparations so that made me feel at ease too during our time there.   I ordered a shrimp and rice which came out on a plate filled with rice and then a strip of shrimp down the middle. The rice was in a pool of liquids making it a bit soggy. I have to say that I can't stand wet rice so I just ate the rice off the top and picked at the shrimp. The dish was disappointing and I didn't leave there feeling like I had an amazing gluten free dish coming from somewhere that specifically has a gluten free menu. The cost of my 10 small shrimp and rice was also $28 which I found to be completely out of line for the quality of the dish.   Now, had that dish come out and completely wowed me, I wouldn't blink at spending $28 on vacation in Las Vegas for dinner. It just didn't do it for me so I can tell you I won't likely go back on my trip to Las Vegas next year.   I would recommend Border Grill because they are educated and understand gluten free meals but I'm not sure it would be my first pick for someone. It's the safe choice.",

We had a large group, so that might have been the problem, but it took forever to get our drinks. Some of us didn't get them at all. Then refills took forever rather they were alcoholic or non!!   The chips were good but the salsa was not. Also, trying to get salt to add to my chips was a nightmare! I asked 3 people for it! The menu was pretty expansive and had a lot of new mexican food and traditional mexican food. The table ordered nachos, quesadillas, ceviche, tortas, tacos and guacamole.  The best of all of it was the guacamole but as you can guess there was NOT enough of it for the money! I know its Vegas but if you are going to pay $10 for guacamole at least give me one whole avocados worth of dip!!   The tacos were VERY SMALL, they are more like street tacos, so if you are looking for big portions do not order this. However they were very tasty! The nachos were probably the biggest hit at the table. The crab and steak ones were tasty and plentiful, you could share these with two people.   The service was also very slow and not what you would expect at a resort like Mandalay Bay! I was very upset with the waitress by the end of the meal.",

Our waiter was very apologetic (and embarrassed) when he told us that his chef would not comply.   The two people at the table with allergies had to eat elsewhere afterward.

We decided to take a wander to see what deliciousness awaits us in this gastronomic wonderland that is the strip.  Not wanting to stray too far from the Expo Hall, we settled on the Border Grill, which - the sign will tell you - was featured on Top Chef Masters, or at least the chef was, or something like that.  So I was expecting top notch food - after all, that's what you would expect from someone who has been featured on Top Chef Masters.  Alas, the fame must have gotten to her head - either that or she has decided to quit her day job, because the food was really average.  But we are getting ahead of ourselves.  First off, where is it - It's in the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino complex, relatively near to the convention center.  The atmosphere can only be described as \"the same as the rest of the place - hectic, frantic, please I just want a quiet place to eat lunch!\"    The efficient staff poured us water into the cute wine glasses (I'd prefer a bigger glass and some ice, personally - alas, it was not to be).  After a while, we ordered - I ordered some nice guacamole and a Chicken Poblano Torta with fries.  Nothing special - just the basics.  We got the chips - cold - and three different types of salsa, in bowls so shallow that we could hardly scoop.  Nice enough, but very very average.  Then the guacamole came.  Ok - this stuff is a little bit above the average, but you want HOW MUCH for this Guacamole?  NINE BUCKS?  Seriously underwhelmed here.  Maybe we are being punished for not being comped.  The Poblano Chicken Torta was alright - average.  The chicken was well cooked, and the poblano was spicy, so it was a good sandwich, but you want HOW MUCH for this sandwich?  It isn't really a Torta, so we'll call it a sandwich from now on.  $19 for that?  Oh, and the fries were cold as well.  Seriously, folks, if this is the best that a Top Chef Master can do, I'm disappointed.  I can get this quality from somewhere else for quarter of the cost and still be satisfied.",

Also, our group was doing the standard bachelorette party scavenger hunt and that staff was being such good sports about our antics.

Check before you go anywhere new!  Located inside Mandalay Bay, all the way on the remote ass side by the convention center and the pool, is Border Grill. Sorta feels like a reject location since you pass like 18 sub-par restaurants on the way there.  Anyway...we sat on the patio despite it being 100+ degrees at 7:30 pm. They have the biggest ceiling fan in the world (it seems) and the patio faces Mandalay's pool so if they're having a concert, you can hear it for free AND enjoy your food!   Service was amazing from the waitress (Thank you Alicia!) down to the busboys/water people.   Basically Border Grill offers fancified Mexican/Central/South American foods...a slight fusion if you wish.   I HAD to order the Sweet Tea Vodka Arnold Palmer drink. They make their own lemonade AND infused vodka with black tea leaves?! Delicious.  We snacked on fresh (and perfectly crunchy) chips with three different types of salsa. We ordered guacamole as our appetizer not anticipating we would be getting more appetizers with our meal. Guacamole was perfectly seasoned, no sour cream or mayo or whatever some places put in it...just perfect. We probably ate 3 baskets of chips.   Chose the Top Chef prix fixe dinner. Basically it comes with a preset trio appetizer and your choice of any entree and any dessert on the entire menu, including specials. MOST excellent!   Appetizer Trio- Sweet corn tamal, Beef Brisket taquito and a black bean+plantain+cheese empanada.   Almost full at this point but so eagerly anticipating my Pistachio crusted Ahi with Poblano risotto that I actually have the foresight to save room!  I was kinda wary about the pistachio tuna but thought it was so out of the box for me that it couldn't possibly be ruined. And it wasn't.   The only thing was that they stressed that the tuna would be lightly seared, but I received it fully cooked through, possibly even slightly overdone. But somehow it maintained its moisture and it was incredibly delicious.   Banana flan. As if flan could be better? Wow...somehow I found room for this in my stretched-thin stomach.  Beautiful meal.",

It is owned by high wattage chefs Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger the two (except too) hot tamales. So a Mexican restaurant with real chefs. A must try.  We started with the tuna crudo and it was a little plain. Although I am merely an amateur, it seemed like it needed an acid of some sort.   Then I moved on to the short rib enchiladas and chips and salsa. First, the chips were homemade, crispy and went down a little too smooth. The enchiladas were really good but I wish that I had settled for the chicken option. Short rib meat seems like a waste in the enchilada and while good it seemed out of place.  Also, I had a cucumber mojito that was like drinking a cucumber. Absolutely delightful.  We liked this place but we are suckers for Mexican food. If you find yourself around the strip and you like Mexican food then you should go here. It is top shelf Mexican but not weird gourmet Mexican. I'll be back.",

I also enjoyed a fresh watermelon margarita made with jalapeno infused tequila - sweet, tangy, spicy goodness. Service was very friendly and attentive.

It is in the Mandalay Bay resort and I find all of the resort restaurants to be overpriced so we paid ~$100 for lunch, 2 entrees and 4 drinks. However I enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa trio as well as my entree. The salsa verde  or tomatillo (?) salsa was my favorite while husband preferred the traditional salsa. I'm sure we could find much cheaper food outside of the resort but I don't mind paying for convenience so I wouldn't hesitate to return here if I didn't feel like leaving the resort.",

I had the Baja ceviche that really took me back to Baja California.  Spot on.  Have you seen Ratatouille?  The moment the critic took a bite of that ratatouille dish and he had a flashback memory of when his mom would make the dish?  That was me.. except it took me back to a Carnival cruise I took to Baja several years ago :)  I also had the white peach lemonade which was delish but more on the sweet side than expected.  No complaints really; it was still really good.  Some of my coworkers got the blood orange lemonade, and I swear they were talking about it the remainder of the day... and into the next day.  I guess I should've ordered that one!  My coworkers all ordered different tacos, and they all said it was much better than expected.  We ordered the guacamole to share, and it was really good too!  I was expecting something along the lines of El Torito, but it's significantly better.",

I wasn't drinking, so appreciated the good sized selection of non alcoholic juice drinks. Sometimes these are sugary and gross but my pomegranate limeade was delicious and I didn't miss the alcohol (too much...)  The guac was really \"meh\" as were the trio of salsas that came first. The green one was the only one with any real flavor. My carnitas plate was also \"ok\" - the meat was a little dry and definitely on the salty side but the veggie slaw was refreshing and crisp.   Definitely one of the better \"reasonable\" options in the Mandalay.",

First we had the quesadillas, they were everything that I wanted them to be, cheesy with a little spice to it. Then we got the biscuits and gravy, so good. (Did I mention Im from Texas). Then it started to go downhill from there. There was a huevos ranchero dish that was kind of bland and boring. Then we had these salmon sliders. I wanted to like these so badly but the prominent taste was goat cheese and it was too overpowering that I had a bite and I was done with it. The next dish was a PBJ with a jalapeno in it. The waiter raved that it was the best thing ever, he lied. It made me feel regret if anything. The other items we had seemed like the same thing just with different sauce: biscuit eggs sauce. So boring I cant even remember them. Then there was the churros. I will shit you not, these were literally donut holes with hersheys syrup and a nasty orange thing with it. The bacon bloody mary was OK and for an extra $10 unlimited mimosas but it didn't make up for the food.  Susan Feniger is one of my favorite chiefs and was so underwhelmed by this restaurant. It made me feel as if I broke up with someone. Im going to go buy a tub of ice cream and eat my feelings.",

    "text": "For my girls-only brunch in celebration of my 30th birthday I chose Border Grill. I think for it being AYCE and having unlimited mimosas for a few extra bucks it is not a bad option. However, it is still just sitting at \"okay\" for me based off of a second experience.  Since I had come here last (2012) they have upped all their prices. What used to be $5 for bottomless mimosas is now $10 (BIG price jump). And what used to be $29.99 AYCE is now $34.99 AYCE. Again, another big price jump.  As for the food and what I had....  Chorizo & Egg Taco - Still good, and still one of the better plates on the menu.  Chilaquiles - OK. I've had better elsewhere.  Bananas Foster  Crepe - Not good. Came out luke-warm, and not tasty.  Salmon Slider - Very good. Salmon smoked nicely, and with the jalapeno bacon and goat cheese, with some spicy sauce, it was delicious. Only down side? The bun was dry.  Eggs Benedict with pork on a biscuit (can't remember the name) - Was actually good, with an over-easy egg to break into the biscuit, mixed with the slow-cooked pork inside was a good combo, but the biscuit was over-powering the meat. Smaller biscuit, or more meat please (more meat would be better).  I did not indulge in mimosas, however my friend did and they have quite the array of flavors. Although she seemed to enjoy the Peach flavor the most. I did have endless cups of coffee, which is served with sugar and cream.  Service was attentive and congenial, but food was slow to arrive, and some plates went missing, only to appear because our server had to go hunt and find them.  Overall I think I may have had my fill of Border Grill Brunch and I will have to branch out and find a brunch in Las Vegas that fulfills my needs better.",

We had a group of 8 on the back patio, which was the perfect setting in Las Vegas summer. It overlooks the \"lazy river\" at Mandalay Bay, but at night it just looks like trees. The server was attentive and took care of whatever we needed. The price was not bad, and everyone loved the food so much we came back 2 more times. 2 more times people!!  The best of the best is the Chili Poblano Burger. (I think thats what it is called). Also, the baja fish tacos that are fried are very good. Just enough batter to salsa/toppings ratio. The Peach Lemonade is a very refreshing non-alcoholic drink too.  Sit outside if you can -  It's the best spot!",

    "text": "Picking a place to eat dinner in Vegas is just about as hard as picking your favorite kid...  On this night, with Mexican, a short walk from the sportsbook at Mandalay Bay, and \"high-quality\" being the requirements, a reservation was made for Border Grill.    I'll admit that going into this, my hopes were a bit low.  That's because I'm not much for most Mexican cuisine or Susan Feniger's personality on TV.  The restaurant is a short walk from the casino toward the Shark Reef/Convention space, and well-signed.  A quick Yelp check-in provided us a free Green Corn Tamale, which our waitress, without prompting, multiplied by three for each person at our table.  It was, hands-down, the most incredible tamale I've ever had.  The masa was rich and moderately sweet, and the portion was perfect for a small starter.    Speaking of starters, their chips and salsa-three-ways is Awesome-Three-Ways.  The chips were nicely sized, thick cut, and sans grease, and all three salsas were among the best I've had.  My favorites were the verde and the smoked chipotle.  My pops and I shared the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas, which were split and served on separate plates before arriving at the table.  My brother-in-law had the Chile Relleno, which I tried (hey, he offered!!).  Both were, again, among the highest quality, freshest flavored, most authentic Mexican food I've had in the states.  Yes, 13 feet from one of the world's largest casino floors.  Weird, but amazing.  As with most restaurants of quality in Vegas, the facility and decor are far above average.  Inside, the space is quieter than you'd think and quite nicely appointed.  There's even outdoor seating with semi-views of the beach and pools in the complex.    This place just became my go-to for Mexican when in Sin City!  Food = 5/5 Facility = 5/5 Service = 4/5 Ambiance = 4/5 Value = 3/5",

    "text": "This is THE place to go for a weekend brunch while in Vegas.  Sitting outside by the pool is awesome, especially when the weather is primo.  This is our \"go-to\" place when Booth, Bloewen, Buxton, and myself hit up the fabulous city of Las Vegas.  The food is great, it is all served to your table, and you can basically try the entire menu.  The real treat is the all you can drink mimosas during breakfast.  They have about 15 different flavors, and of course we had to try them all.  Buxton's favorite was by far the prickly pear.  We've had a lot of great memories over the years having brunch at the Border Grill.  Service is always nice, and they are more than friendly dealing with our shenanigans of heavy drinking.  After trying numerous champagne brunches in Vegas, this is my favorite spot when the weather is tolerable.    Prices are slightly on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for.  This is a brunch place that is a \"must visit\" on each trip to the \"City that never sleeps.\"",

The Ceviche, empanadas and Yucatan pork were the best I've had in a while . When I saw meringue on the  tres leches, I was expecting a bit of a crunch but it was a soft one on top which was a bummer for me but still tasted amazing. We enjoyed the cozy patio",

You can also do unlimited small plates for brunch with the bottomless mimosas... but it isn't cheap. It's about $54 all together. But worth it for a special occasion! It's a great restaurant too, overlooking the Mandalay beach.",

They serve you very crispy tortilla chips with three different salsas (you can also get guacamole for a separate charge). The chips were perfect. It's hard to find a Mexican restaurant that does tortilla chips well. The salsas and guacamole were also really good.  At the end we were served two small desserts that had sorbet and fruit. I'm not sure if this came with the meal or if we were just lucky, but those were refreshing. Our server, Alicia C. Was very nice, prompt, and really made sure our dining experience went well.  I would definitely recommend going here for all the food you get and the great service. It's hard to find restaurants that won't break the bank on the strip!",

    "text": "Fantastic food and service ALL AROUND!  I was here for a week-long trade show for work, and this place was the designated venue space for many gatherings during that time. From breakfasts to dinner, I came here a total of 4 times.  First visit was for breakfast, to which I had the ham-infused waffle and scrambled eggs. My goodness - that waffle was a genius idea, mixing the sweet and savory in with every bite. I thought actually the ham was Canadian bacon, but then I was told otherwise. So good! Definitely get this. The amount of syrup that was drizzled on top of it was just right, and the flaky and soft texture of the waffle itself made it sublime. Ahh..still dreaming about it. :) The side of scrambled eggs that I had with it were good as well.  For dinner and happy hour time, I was lucky enough to sample their chilaquiles, guacamole, sausages as well, and they were all so very good. Fresh ingredients and very well-balanced in flavors too.  The service here is outstanding, and genuine. When you're in a city like Las Vegas, you sometimes would think that service at restaurants could be pretentious, but not here at all.  Definitely check out this place for breakfast, as if you're attending a conference or trade show at the convention center, it's right in the same direction going and coming back.  Next time if I'm back in the area for work or pleasure, I'll definitely stop by!",

We'd just visited Hussong's Cantina the day before and after hitting up Border, there is simply no comparison. Hussong's is average, nothing special but not bad... typical Mexican place. Border is special, beats out every other place I've hit up, hands down. We had the baja ceviche, brisket tacitos, and plantain empanadas, and all three were worthy of a phenomenal 5 star review of their own. And big bonus: a fantastic local IPA on tap, something sorely missing in every other bar we hit.   Bottom line: DON'T MISS THIS PLACE.",

Service was good and most of the food prices were in the $$ range except for a few items.  Drinks were pretty good, margaritas especially. Got the queso fundo and Baja ceviche for appetizers. The former was unremarkable although the ceviche was good and must try. Also got the free corn tamale with the check in which was actually on the sweeter side.  For main course, I got the chicken poblano enchiladas which i for some reason kept associating with mole poblano sauce, but there was no mole. Anyways it was quite delicious. I do not recommend getting the side of potatoes. It's smashed but also deep fried and too crispy.  Overall good experience. We also got a discount because we were attending a conference nearby. They didn't know about the discount but ended up getting it anyways.",

    "text": "We've been going to the Border Grill for brunch for years and love it!  We typically always go to new restaurants as there are so many to try, but the fact that we keep coming back here is a testament to how great the experience is!    If you're coming from outside Mandalay, the best drop off point is by the Shark Reef.   We normally sit by the bar which always has open tables and makes it closer to the bottomless mimosas :)  The food is great!  So much variety in Mexican tapas. Unlike a buffet, this food comes out fresh. Some of my favorites are the green corn tamale, skirt steak and egg (my only small complaint would be that I always order this well done and it comes out medium rare...they're great about fixing it though), and chilaquiles.   If you like mimosas, you have to try the bottomless ones here. I think they have about 12 different flavors at anytime and they're very unique:  strawberry coconut, blackberry ginger, passion fruit, prickly pear, etc. be careful as they can sneak up on you though!    There are lots of places in Vegas with good food and drinks, but what really sets this place apart is the service. Melody is usually the manager during brunch and she always remembers us, even if it's been awhile since our last visit. She always makes the time to check in and is so friendly!  We miss Chelsea at the bar, but Matthew waited on us for the first time and was also great. He brought us some things to try that we didn't order and they were great choices.   If it's been awhile since you've been there, they now have a station where they make salads and a few other things. A salad is one of the items Matthew brought us and it was really good.   Melody suggested we come back for dinner sometime as they have the similar small plates concept. We're looking forward to that!    Go check out Border Grill. You won't be disappointed!",

They were okay but nothing spectacular. The handmade chips and salsa you get before the meal are great. You'll get three different salsas, nothing too spicy. My favorite was the lime salsa. A little tart but works well with the salt in the chips. Highly recommend ordering the guacamole. It's fresh and made onsite. The Cadillac Margarita had more tequila than a lot of the margaritas I've had on the strip. Prices aren't too bad and eating outside on the balcony gives you a great view of the pool and the eight foot fan keeps the air moving.",

And for brunch this place has ALL YOU CAN EAT  tapas, and yes I did say ALL YOU CAN EAT. And that's lot all! Just for 10$ more you can add bottomless mimosas! And not just champagne and regular orange. You can choose from 12 different juices! From blood orange, to peach, to strawberry! But be cautious... Those mimosas will sneak up on you!  We tried a lot of the plates but just could not do them all. It was just the two of us, it would be more beneficial if there were a few of you doing the brunch so you can try more food. The highlight of the meal, a must get, if you do come is the shrimp & grits and the spicy chicken tamale! You will die so bomb.   Their grits is hands down the best I have ever had. It is so cheesy and flavorful. And the salsa on top amazing! Not too spicy but just right. The tamale was also one of the best I ever had! It is really spicy tho but I can take it. The sweet corn tamale wasn't all that great so just skip that.   The oyster taco was also pretty amazing. Everything was amazing. The staff was very attentive. Made sure our glasses were never empty. One I thing I do wish they had were desserts.   Oh! And if you sign up for their rewards thing, they give you 15% off every time  you dine with them!   I would come here again and recommend this place for a nice classy brunch! I'll be back!",

We were seated quickly and sat indoors because it was cold outside, although some people were sitting on the heated patio. The service was really friendly and prompt on both visits. The chips and salsa which were brought to the table without being ordered for a cost of $4 were fine. The $53 Harris Ranch Gaucho Steak with chilaquiles (basically nachos with cheese) was good, the chicken enchilada was ok. I didn't like the fish tacos because they were too spicy and the fish was a little dry, but another person in our group liked them. They get points for sustainability, but I couldn't justify the cost of some of the items on the menu. The layout is open concept and is an average noise level. The washroom is outside of the restaurant, downstairs in the convention centre area of Mandalay Bay.",

This was my third visit to this location (located in Mandalay Bay)for the brunch (served Sat and Sun from 11-3).    TIP: For $38.99/person you can order unlimited small/tapas-like plates during brunch.  Be sure to order multiple at a time and share with your table mates.  Order multiple at a time b/c sometimes The kitchen gets backed up.   TIP X 2: for $15 you can order unlimited mimosas.  TIP x 3: For $20 you can order an unlimited combinations of bloody Marys, Micheladas and or mimosas!   Make sure you make a reservation!  Sometimes its busy like today and during other visits it hasn't been too busy at all.    I prefer to sit on the top deck outside because it overlooks the Mandalay Bay pool.  Moreover, theres usually a nice breeze as a Big A** Fan on is usually on - look up when you visit and you'll see what I mean.  The restaurant is 2 floors indoors and top covered outdoor patio.   Im not sure what they put on their tortilla chips but they are addicting and soooo good in a different way.    My stand out favorites of foods from the brunch are: pigs in a croissant, chicken and waffles, steak (medium) and eggs -which are served  on a bed of black beans, yum, yum! Churro bites (3 minis) served with a Guava Sauce that looks like caramel.  Be sure to try their spin of the tres leches bread pudding with blueberries as topping! You can thank me later :)   They have MULTIPLE mimosa flavors:  my favorite is the blood orange but you can also select from original, prickly pear, passion  fruit, peach, pomegranate and a couple others!   Be patient when ordering drinks and food!  Days like today - it seems as though our waiter was the only one on the outside deck that was taking orders and the other staff members were running food out.",

We decided on unlimited small plates/tapas for $38.99 and bottomless mimosas for $15 and it was so worth it. We had a great experience. There were 6 different mimosas and we made sure not to leave until we tried all 6 flavors, and that really added to the experience. We tried almost everything on the menu. My favorite was the Peruvian shrimp and grits and I probably ordered that 4 times. Boyfriend's favorite was the bbq brisket mini torta.    Bathroom is shared with Mandalay Bay outside the restaurant, down the set of stairs you see.  I also love their pact on sustainability with the foods they cook with.   Would recommend? Want best bottomless brunch in Vegas with no wait, then yes!",

Sat on the patio, and despite it being cold outside, the extensive placement of patio heaters made it warm and cozy. The staff was very attentive to our needs and the food was delicious. Felt $14 may have been too high of a price for a margarita, but the drink was great. Had the Chile Relleno duo for dinner and it was delicious. They also have a separate vegan menu for those into that. Highly recommend, especially if you want to get out of the stressful environment of the rest of the Strip.",

We split 9 between the 2 of us and they were all great. Favorites were the steak and eggs, chilaquiles, short rib hash, lobster cachaoas, and egg, and pancakes of the day (lemon, ricotta and blueberries.   But the rest were great, too - chicken tamales, diablo fried chicken, Peruvian shrimp and grits, and campechana. So lovely on the shady, breezy patio by the pool. Wonderful, friendly service, too.

With the steak & eggs, you can have you eggs done to your preference. We ordered our steak medium and its was delicious. The guacamole on both dishes were wonderful too.   Other dishes worth noting was the cinnamon roll pancakes, chicken & waffles, and the tres leches bread pudding.   The dish we weren't impressed with happened to be the \"pigs in a blanket\". I'm not sure if it was meant to come out cold, but it was not good at that temperature.   My wife was impressed with the bottomless mimosas. For $15 she received the bottle and four juice concentrates. (Peach was definitely the best).  We definitely will be coming back!",

    "text": "Listen. I've loved this place. Read my earlier reviews. Long story kept long...I paid valet to eat at the Border Grill in Caesar's Palace. When I went in they had closed it. I had already paid and I needed the miles ;) so I walked to the other end of the strip bc I was hangry for BG in a bad way. I ordered Poblano Chicken Enchiladas- my go to Mexican delight. Two bites in and - gulp- a hair..(insert crying face emoji). I simply asked for a replacement dish - same one. Part way in I realized it had lost some luster so I left half plate of hairless enchiladas for which my server promptly served me a full check. I'm not THAT guy but it didn't feel right so I mentioned it which brought about a visit from the manager - Sierra? Sienna? - who was just too perfect. She handled it and even explained that bc the food is so fresh they husk their own corn and she thought it was a husk. Perhaps...perhaps not....accidents happen regardless and I'll still give this place my business w preference bc of a manager that thankfully saved it for me. Now...crap I have to walk back to the other end of the strip.",

    "text": "This long running Mexican eatery is located at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.   The location is optimal as the Border Grill has outside seating overlooking the scenic Mandalay Bay Pool,  which is perhaps the Best in Vegas.   The establishment is run by \"Celebrity Chefs SUSAN and MARY LOU  who based upon their years in business, meet with success.   Unfortunately, this was not apparent in our recent visit.  My wife and I sat at the bar for lunch.   We noticed that restaurant was sparsely populated with less than six patrons (including us).   Despite the lack of customers it was impossible to get the barkeep to notice us and as a result, it took over ten minutes to get a drink! To add insult to injury, it took another ten minutes to get a menu, another 20 to get Chips & Salsa and another 30 minutes to order our food.  It was like a job that you don't get paid for!   Which brings us to the food.   The Chips & Salsa were a huge disappointment.  The three Salsa melodies were bland with little or zero flavor. I actually had to ask for salt, pepper and hot sauce to \"doctor\" the \"tasteless Salsas\".  What was worse was the accompanying chips, which  were of poor quality and therefore lent themselves well to the heretofore mentioned \"tasteless Salsas\".   For My main entree I had the chicken tacos which were served so \" Stone Cold\" that Steve Austin would have been proud.   My wife had the chicken Quesadilla which were also cold. As we are all aware, chicken has to be served at certain temperature to prevent against food poisoning, so we were uncomfortable eating these dishes.   Perhaps they should rename the dishes as \"Chicken Salmonella\" inspired Tacos and Quesadillas.   At this juncture we did our best \"Surrender Dorothy\" and got out of Oz!   On a final note, the price-point for the Border Grill is steep and there are better Mexican restaurants available in the Mandalay Bay shopping mall at a fraction of the cost.  The \"Celebrity Chef\" thing is getting old as is the Border Grill.",

You order off a menu (rather than a buffet which I prefer) and it's unlimited.  Nothing absolutely blew me away, but everything was good. The rundown:  -Bacon Jalapeno PBJ Sandwich - it was alright. The biscuit it came on was super dense -Cinnamon roll pancake - UGH too sweet. Did not like this at all -Mary's chicken and waffle - did like this -Steak and eggs (minus the egg) - This is the one exception. The steak was phenomenal. Cooked perfectly and DELICIOUS. Flavor was totally on point! -Peruvian Shrimp and Grits (which Peruvians don't serve lol), was alright; felt the flavors could have been more balanced -Green corn tamale - excellent flavor, way too soft and runny -Spicy Chicken tamale - good presentation, flavor was lacking -The mimosas were good  Overall I'd go back and try the regular menu. Definitely recommend if you're at Mandalay.",

Very friendly servers, engaging waiter who made spot on recommendations of the very tasty Yucatan pork and chicken enchiladas. Portion sizes were absolutely huge and would be easy to share. We also enjoyed the ceviche and margaritas. Compared to most restaurants in LV, this is a relative bargain and so delicious. We even got a tasty ice cream and warm, gooey chocolate cookie desert comped for my birthday.  Highly recommend!",

The food - it was very good, fresh and well done, but nothing will rock yor world. ....at all. I was expecting more interesting options. I'd read reviews saying it was not a burrito, quesadilla type menu - but it WAS. Maybe they've had to dumb it down to accommodate the masses? Sad, very sad.  The margarita's were too sweet. The waitress couldn't offer up any alternatives? That's sad too.  Bottom line - NOT a destination, but just fine if you are there already.",

I found the food to be good, but if you're looking for what Californians traditionally  consider to be Mexican food, you may be thrown off. For example, I had beef brisket taquitos with a pineapple pico de gallo, refried black beans, and a red and green rice. My husband had some sort of pork in plantain leaves. So, definitely not your typical taco/burrito/quesadilla joint.   That said, I think they're going for a more upscale vibe the likes of spots like Rosa Mexicano in NYC. While the food fits, the atmosphere is off for such a place, as there's no denying you're in a Vegas food court.",

Ok, it's only fifty cents, however, given how terrible the desert water is, it is a crime that a fee is charged for filtered tap water water, this should be done as a courtesy for guests.  We're not talking sparkling or bottled water here, it's plain water from the tap.  What's next, a fee for air conditioning?  There is no mention of this charge on the menu, it just appears on ones bill.  While it is a nominal amount, my guess is that most guests overlook it, however, when one is charged $24.00 for three enchiladas, charging for tap water is borderline abuse.",

Cantina Tex Mex is such a great cuisine, and so often under served. This food here was really good, reasonably priced and completely unpretentious - a nice change for a Vegas venue. The Margaritas were excellent. The ceviche sopas were fresh and snappy, not o saucy and just macerated enough. The guac and salsas were super fresh and flavorful, with enough house flair to make them mentionable. I see short ribs all over the place these days, but the rendering here was a Delicious little taquito that did it for me. El Yum-o. If in the Mandalay, the BG is a great bet for happy hour, or just a quick bite on your way from the convention center to the hotel. Andale to the Mandalay, con mucho gusto.",

It took forever to have our order taken, and an unacceptably long time to be served.  I ordered the marinated skirt steak, which was supposed to have a lime marinade.  It had no flavor, had clearly not been marinated, and tasted like a cheap steak that was just taken out of the freezer.

Besides that, the food receives 1.5 stars.  BUT when you're poolside at Mandalay Bay and you actually want to sit down and eat (not eat on your deck chair...if you're lucky but on the ground if you didn't get a chair), the Border Grill is the closest option.  I was starving, famished...and I couldn't find anything on the menu that looked appealing.  I thought a burrito would be the next best thing to a burger...but no burritos!  Tacos - too small!  Carnitas platter - for some reason - bleh!  So, I got the chilaquiles.  That was probably a bad call - it was essentially a bunch of chips baked into a \"casserole\" which was layered with cheese and a little bit of meat.  Really, it just ended up being a big mess of soggy chips and a teeeeny bit of chicken.  I was so sad...  I left feeling full but not the good kind of full - the kind of full that feels gross because you know you just ate a bunch of icky food.  I'd had a salad before which was just chicken on top of iceberg lettuce, so I thought something more legitimately \"Mexican\" might be better...but not so much!",

There was a Lowe's conference taking place there, and getting through the crowd to get to the entrance was quite an adventure.  It was dark and pretty much empty in the restaurant.   Our service was excellent. We ordered the trio of salsas and the guacamole. Very good.   My mother and siblings all ordered humongous margaritas. They looked great. I was nursing a massive hangover, so I had a Pepsi.  I ordered the plantain empanadas (not mexican, BTW). The presentation was lacking- they were just there on the plate. Almost like some frozen snack you microwave and toss on a plate.   I abhor sweet with savory, so this was not the dish for me. The filling is not appealing to the eye and is sweet. They weren't horrible, but I just couldn't get past the sweet. Next time I'll try the green corn tamales.  My sister's friend ordered the tortilla soup. The \"soup\" was too thick and didn't have much flavor. However, the soup has these cubes of cheese that are so damn delicious...I just gold-mined those out of her soup throughout the meal. They were absolutely my favorite of the evening. I could eat a whole bucket of those cheese cubes!!!",

    "text": "Once upon a time Chi-Chi's had the Seafood Enchilada, it had a creamy sherry sauce.  Well, when the better half and I stopped into Border Grill during a trip to MMS they had a Seafood Enchilada with a creamy sherry sauce.  I hoped against hope that it was the same thing.  Unfortunately it was 35 dollars. And it wasn't the same.  I grant you this is entirely my expectations vs. reality.  But because it wasn't what I wanted it to be, I didn't really care for it. So it felt like 35 dollars wasted.  The better half got the Quesadillas which WERE really good. So she was happy.  My other frustration is the Las Vegas Mexican restaurant trick of asking if you want \"Fresh Guacamole\". This is code for \"Would you like to pay 9 more dollars?\"  They rarely inform you it's an extra cost and they ask so nicely. Don't be fooled.  Fortunately I knew from a previous bad experience.  The chips and salsa were very good, and our waiter was excellent.  When I explained the Chi-Chis story he said \"What's Chi-Chi's\".  (Now I feel old!)  Overall, I can't say it was bad, and as long as you don't mind the somewhat high cost of the Mexican food. I would absolutely come back for the Quesadillas",

This last visit was kind of ruined out of nowhere with an offensive remark by one of the servers who delivered one of the rounds of food. It was myself plus one other guest. Completely unnecessary and just ruined the experience for me. I can usually brush off jokes but this one just came off in the completely wrong way.",

    "text": "I've been to this location twice in my past 2 vegas trips and I must say the meal was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while.  Both times that I've been here we got the brunch option which i believe is only available Saturdays and Sundays not sure about friday i forget. It is a bit pricey there were about 8 of us all got the brunch option with bottomless mimosas and it came out to about $45 each, but all totally worth it.  Brunch gives you the a list of BOTTOMLESS \"small plates\" options ranging from a tres leches french toast, chilaquiles, and huevos rancheros i believe there are 21 options to choose from and I suggest going on a empty stomach if you go for brunch because its each one of those plates are amazing! If you go in a big group you can order in a sort of family style and they bring out a good amount of that one dish so it comes out faster and everyone can try a little bit of it all.  The tres leches french toast is hands down one of my favorites, I also recommend the steak and eggs, huevos rancheros, and definitely the chilaquiles fersure.  Also get the bottomless mimosas, they have a ton of different flavors, i tried all of them and let me tell you they were all good.  Service was just perfect both times ive gone, I forgot both their names cuz i usually leave too drunk because of the mimosas lol but they were both super friendly and fast. At one single moment I 3 people helping take out my dirty empty plates, fill my empty glass of water, take my order for my next mimosa and ask if everything was good. We were all impressed.   All in all, great food, great atmosphere, amazing service, and I will definitely be coming back on my next trip.",

It's tapas style Sunday morning. $35 for endless brunch and +$10 for endless mimosas. Delish overall. The tapas are not that small. So I suggest going with someone and each person getting different things to share",

If it isn't my Mexican blood boiling and rattling for some Mexican food, for my Mexican ass :)  Was in town with a few friends to celebrate a Bday (woo hoo -_-) and was down the hall looking at some sharks and endless fish (The Aquarium). When the appetite kicked in, I remember seeing this little joint & figured ''Ehhhh, why not?''. I have my good ol' pal take me and the feast begun.  They greeted us w/ ice cold water & chips w/ salsa :) Their salsa is to die for. The chips were warm, as if they had just taken them out the oven.  The setting was very charming and dim :) I liked the attentiveness that the staff carried. It being my first time, I remember asking the waiter for any recommendations and he suggested I tried their Posole. I did just that, and I do not regret one bit. It was perfect. Kind of reminded me of my Grammy's cooking :)  Over all, it was a pleasant experience.  -Ps, thanks for the salsa I had to go.... It spilled in my purse :) but thanks anyway!",

Unfortunately the quality of the food and service was below par. Especially for the price. Some of the plates were ok, most of them not that great. One of my first plates came out cold!    Great idea, I just think they need to brush up on quality service and food preparation. Our server did not check on us enough, making the whole process a lot longer. Also they let the plates stack up, which is a pet peeve of mine since I've worked in the industry for a long time. I hate when people don't bus their tables. It's simple, when you drop off a plate you should be picking up one. Our service in general was slow, at one point I think we were sitting and waiting to order a drink for almost 30 mins.",

    "text": "I have been fortunate enough to work with Susan and Mary Sue through their partnership with the California Avocado Commission and have tasted their food from the LA restaurants and food trucks alike. Everything has been as wonderful as the chefs themselves. This LV location is not representative of that tradition. At least not on the night I brought my family here.  We sat and had our drink orders taken. The Arnold palmers were sweeter than dessert should be. Traded them out for iced teas instead. Chips and salsa were mentioned but didn't make it to the table until after the appetizer hit us. Bit of a fail in the service.  The appetizer was the queso fundido. Great. Except that an appetizer meant to be shared by the table of 4 came with 1 flour tortilla! Really? If you're going to give us 1 tortilla to share then cut it up into wedges at least, so we don't all have to try to be polite about our tiny portion of 1 tortilla to share! Should have been at least 2-3 instead of 1. An extra one cost a buck so why not add the buck to the original cost if $1 is the issue? The main course was a little bit of a lot of stuff. The Guatemalan ceviche was perfect. Bravo ceviche bar! The carnitas were run of the mill. No seasoning, nothing memorable at all aside from the presentation. Yucca fries in chimichurri with garlic aioli were also basic AF. We skipped dessert because we did not want to be disappointed one more time.  The personality and creativity this team of chefs has was so underrepresented in this meal that I just gave up on the night. Went back to the room and got some zzzs to put the day away. I thought going to the two hot tamales in Vegas was a sure bet but the gamble did not pay off. Oh yeah. And something made me sick. It's 10am and I can't imaging eating still.",

I recommend the skirt steak dinner and tres leches cake or the churros, but I'm convinced you can't go wrong....even the flour tortillas are incredible.",

Since everything on the menu sounded delicious, he started us off with his recommendations. He also informed us that they had different flavored mimosas so each time he refilled our glasses, it was with a new flavor. We tried every flavor they had to offer. And boy were we tipsy.  My favorite dish was probably the shrimp and grits! Again, if you haven't noticed a trend in my reviews.. I LOVE SEAFOOD so anything with it, I will love it. Other faves were the steak and eggs, breakfast fries and the waffles. YUMMMM and out of the mimosa flavors, my favorite would have to be the peach one!  Will definitely be back next time I'm in sin city!",

I thought the outside patio would be a nice comfortable setting for a casual business meeting. While I was waiting for the others to arrive I ordered a lemonade and was brought tortilla chips with three different salsas. The tortilla chips were crisp and tasted like they had just been fried even though there was no visible sign of grease. I also enjoyed the freshly squeezed strawberry lemonade which had a balanced flavor. I ordered the house  guacamole, tortilla soup, and a chicken Caesar salad. Both the house guacamole and the chicken Caesar salad were executed well. The guacamole was seasoned well and the avocado had a lot of natural flavor. The chicken in the salad was grilled to perfection and the Caesar dressing was just right on the anchovy. I wasn't as thrilled with the tortilla soup. The tomato broth was a little thick, it had big chunks of unmelted cheese, and it didn't come out hot.   Our waitress, helped us out with a discount for locals and told us about the Sunday Brunch where you get unlimited plates. I like the concept of all you can eat plates because the quality of the food is normally better, you don't have to hassle with other people, and it's more sanitary. I will be back eventually to try brunch.",

Before we could finish the appetizers the entree came. Then the desert.  There was no breathing room in between courses, and that is too bad, as the food was amazing.  That said, the guacamole was the best I have ever had. The chips divine, not oily not stale, just perfect.  Two of ordered the 42.00 per person deal, which includes one app, one entree and the dessert.  The appetizer was a trio of appetizers. One fried plantain, one beef taquito and one tamale. The fried plantain was great crispy on the outside, warm sweetness's on the inside. The beef taquito crunchy and delicious. I never got to the tamale, the entree came before I could try it. I did not want my entree to get cold so I bypassed the tamale.  I had the boneless beef short ribs or corn polenta. Fabulous, the beef so tender the polenta had a little kick but not so overwhelming. My friend had the special rib eye gaucho steak. I had a taste, it was great, had I know I would have ordered it. My other friend had another special she did comment it was spicy. It was stuffed peppers I am not sure the name.  The portions were huge. We took half home.  Now the dessert was fantastic, it was the special for the day. Banana cream pie. Not your ordinary banana cream pie. This had 3 layers of banana bread each separated by luscious layers of banana cream with fresh bananas, whipped cream on top and swirls of chocolate sauce.  Honestly one of the best tasting meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. If I do get to go back I hope the service will be slower, so this wonderful food can be savored and enjyed as it was meant to be.",

    "text": "Not sure who I think is more crazy - the people complaining about 50 cents for water or the people who consider chevys to be in the same spectrum for comparison.    The menu says they charge 50 cents for water so no surprises and you can turn it down.  They use a water purification system for environmental reasons.  I think it's great and a nominal price to charge.  And ff 50 cents for water is an issue, what are you doing on the vegas strip where there is a markup on anything and everything??    We decided on going to Border Grill as my husband and I live in NYC and my sister and her husband live in Chicago so we like to pick restaurants that we can't get at home.     Chips and Salsa were tasty and complimentary (they easily could charge for that given it is Vegas).  We got the guacomole, also good and reasonably priced at $9.  Only complaint was that as soon as we finished our first bowl of chips, they immediately placed a second one down.  I have no self control and was pretty full by the time dinner arrived.  For dinner, we each ordered different things and each loved our meals (Tecate Carnitas, Chicken Mole, Jumbo Shrimp, Chicken Quesadilla).  I got the Tecate Carnitas, everything came on the side so you could eat as you please.  As a very picky eater, I couldn't have been happier.  My husband who hadn't been in a big Mexican mood ordered the Shrimp and ate every drop on his plate.  My husband ordered the Banana Cream Pie for dessert.  We all groaned at the idea of desser because were so full but of course, we said we'd try a bite.  Easily the best banana cream pie any of us had ever had.  And no, we didn't take just one bite.  Cocktails were also great.  Strawberry mojito was really refreshing and delicious.  Would have been nicer to have them a little bigger in size as it wouldn't be that hard to drink 3 or 4 but at $12 a glass, it adds up.  I had the skinny pink lemonade which was great for a low calorie drink.  My sister had the non alcholic sparkling white peach lemoade which was $5 but only $2.50 for a refill which I thought was nice.  Beer was $6 a bottle, very reasonable for Vegas.  As for service, I saw some complaints on here.  Obviously service can be luck of the draw, but our server Autumn, was easily the nicest/friendliest server any of us had in a long time which just made the meal even more enjoyable.  Obviously, I am a fan.  If I am in LA or Vegas in the future, I will definitely be making a point to go again :-)",

We had two vegetarians in the group who absolutely couldn't eat onions--which eliminates 99% of the menu--and the server did not offer to see what he could do to accommodate.

    "text": "i have been wanting to try out border grill's brunch for a few weeks now. with my birthday on sunday Dan decided to take me here. woohoo!! how have i never tried out their brunch?? it was the best brunch I have had here in Las Vegas. Everyone was so delightful and even made me a birthday card. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with selecting what we wanted. for $25 it is an all you can eat made to order brunch. did you read that? MADE FRESH! ALL YOU CAN EAT! YUMS! we started with a guava empanada. it was good, but i knew i had to get my share of the yucatan egg benedict. I should have saved that for last though.very filling for such a small plate. the biscuit and sausage gravy was amazing too. steak and eggs were an A+ and Dan's favorite. the coconut french toast had me wide eyed with a giant smile. very heavenly. i wish i could have tried more. this is when i wish my stomach was larger. our waitress brought me out a mexican chocolate birthday cake which was awesome. something to order when it is not included in the all you can eat menu. for $5 more we added on the bottomless mimosas and i am so glad we did. they have a few flavors to choose from including the classic mimosa. I was very pleased with this brunch and I am sure I will be back. The covered outside patio had me feeling like i was on vacation even though I am a local. The food was amazing and the staff beyond friendly when they didn't have to be. They made my birthday! They also offer a locals card with your Las Vegas ID for 15% off which is an added bonus. This place was def money well spent. Can't wait for the next brunch!",

We had planned on the three course pre show choices but our server made the suggestion of the all you can eat tapes menu for $3 more. Omg the best decision we made. We were first told that we would get to pick what we got up our server ended up picking for us.  We basically at all the apps and over half the main courses.  What we enjoyed most was items we would have never even considered ordering actually ended up being some of the best food we ate all night. Now of course there was a few items we didn't enjoy but when you end up getting 19 plates that is a given.  We left feeling stuffed and really just wanted to sleep off dinner at the table, but we are so thankful to an amazing server for telling us about. This was the best Mexican food we have ever had and recommend to anyone if you can do this you so should.",

We went on a Friday night and was surprised to find only a few occupied tables. The hostess was very friendly and pretty much let us choose our table. She did, however, recommended sitting poolside and in hindsight I think the upstairs patio would have had better ambiance. Nevertheless it was still beautiful and extremely peaceful. The sangria was refreshing and added to the mood. For dinner I ordered the grilled fish tacos with avocado crema. The fish was delicious; very light and fresh. I wasn't a fan of the green rice but it was fine because the meal was also served with a tomato rice. I wouldn't say there was anything extraordinary about this restaurant but I enjoyed my meal and left completely satisfied.",

The service was great...until the storm hit.  All of a sudden there was crazy wind and rain, and I guess their computers went down.  We waited for over 30 minutes in order to get our check.  Our poor server tried his best to keep us happy, but he was a bit frazzled himself.  After finding out it was only his 3rd day on the job, I was much more impressed with how he handled things.  If it wasn't for that crazyness, and no manager addressing our table when it all happened, there would have been 5 stars.  Good food.  Job well done, Jason.  Thank you for the birthday cake!",

    "text": "We had our wedding reception in a beautiful private room overlooking the patio.  The room holds about 60 sit down, and I think up to 80 stand up. We put down an 800$ dollar deposit, with a minimum of 4,000$, add on tax and tip and round up to about 5,100. They also have a smaller room that holds about 35 people for 3000$ minimum.    The banquet coordinator Jessica was unbelievably sweet and helpful.  She went above and beyond the call of duty. She helped me with everything.  I emailed her about a million times and talked with her at length about everything. Cake, food, rental, seating arrangements, flowers, and even suggestions of other vendors.  She helped me find rental chairs and she booked it under her business name and got me a cheaper rate. The Border Grill chairs are an orange-brownish color. I really wanted silver chairs. The rental chairs ran about 10$ dollars each, and Jessica got me her cheaper rate at about 8$ each. She also got me a speaker and microphone for about 50$ dollars cheaper. You don't really need a speaker if your best man is loud enough. Go through Jessica, she makes sure the rental's show up on time.I think she knows about getting a DJ as well.  I don't think a DJ is worth it. The Border Grill music is pipped in, the stereo system is awesome. It is kind of Jazzy, Latin music. They can also turn it off really quick when you have speeches.  I had already booked my wedding cake with another vendor for about 500$. They add a cake cutting fee, I think 2$ per person.  FYI...she is working with the chef on wedding cakes.  I think she said they would run about 170$ for 30 people, but don't quote me on that. She had no pictures, so I went with my first option.  Talk to her about cakes, see if they updated the website with pictures.    They have no hidden charges.  She sits with you on the phone tapping away at her calculator.  So you know exactly what things will cost.   She helped me with my choice of entrees and changes that I wanted with adding on different types of sauces and salads.  Their \"Set Menu\" are very flexible, and the prices are very reasonable...for Vegas. I got about 8 appetizer platters to pass around for cocktail half hour they run anywhere from 13$ to 50$.  I had two salad choices, a champagne toast and for the entrees I had  fish, skirt steak, and enchilada's.  About 65$ per person. Everyone raved about the food. I printed my own menu's, see pictures above. I wish that I had printed a drink menu of margarita's and sangria suggestions on the back of my menu's.  I don't think people took full advantage of the full bar and they mostly got wine and beer.   So my total cost for 55 people with the ultra lavish food, tons of appetizers, champagne toast, full open bar and amazing rental chairs ran about 9000$ dollars. You can easily go thousands less depending on your guest count, food and rental needs. I also asked Jessica to charge my card for about 1000$ a month for four months so that I did not have a crazy bill on my wedding day. Don't worry, she really only needs the deposit to hold the room.  Layaway wedding...less stress. Also if you want to send favors, menu's and candles. Ship them to her office. She told me to send them to her, and I made the mistake of shipping all my boxes to The hotel room. Then they charged me 30$ to deliver to my room and then the hotel lost one of my boxes. Jessica walked over to the postal delivery room and talked with security and had him look through all of the boxes for me.  WOW, talk about above and beyond. Thank You. The lost box had my cake server set, thank God Jessica had a nice set to lend me. They do provide beautiful candles in an orange striped color glass, so if your colors match that then your set for the tables.   We had a beautiful wedding reception. It was magical. Worth every penny.",

My friends & I sat on their lovely patio for brunch for the 2nd time & it keeps getting better & better. Hands down, no Las Vegas brunch can match the quality & price you get at Border Grill. We also had the pleasure of meeting \"The Two Hot Tamales,\" it's great to see a celebrity chef owned restaurant with chefs actively involved in their own restaurant & not just a famous name attached to it! Even the executive chef Mike came out to our table just to make sure we were enjoying everything. I can't wait to go back for brunch, next time I'll try the unlimited mimosas they offer, the table next to us had them & those mimosas looked so refreshing! Thanks for another great dining experience!",

Their chips and salsa were yummy and we ordered some guac which was tasty as well.  We ordered a poblano quesadilla and Border classics appetizer to share (2 corn tamales, 2 plantain empanadas, and 2 chicken panudos). We weren't sure what to get, so the Border Classics was recommended.    The quesadilla was pretty good, but the cheese was a bit rich. The corn tamales were my favorite.  I love this type of corn filling, being from the South (where it is sometimes called fried corn).  The plantain empanadas were soggy and bland, so we did not finish those.  We are 99% vegetarian but were hungry so we each tasted the chicken panudos.....the chicken tasted boiled and very bland, so we did not eat more than the one bite and I wished that I had not tasted it at all.  The worst part of the experience was that everything was pretty darned expensive.  We went during a very busy time, yet the service was still pretty good and everyone we encountered was pleasant.  They kept the beer coming, and we had a good time overall, so I might give it another go when I'm back out that way.",

    "text": "03/17/12 BRUNCH.  I haven't reviewed BGLV before this? I'm surprised. We went almost every Wed night that Mary Sue was competing in \"Top Chef Masters\" last year. Sat in the bar with other fans, ate/drank for 1-2 hours, it was great fun. Great staff, bartenders, waitresses.  We, spouse and I, are ANCIENT foodies, and have known the \"2 Hot Tamales\", Mary Sue and Susan, since they started off in a storefront and only using hot plates, along Melrose Blvd back in the early 80s in LA. I experienced all of their iterations in the culinary world, most especially City Restaurant. I miss City. And Ciudad. I love Street, and try to return there when I can, when visiting LA.  But you know what is the best thing about THIS Border Grill, the Las Vegas location? The man they have in charge at the stoves, Executive Chef Mike Minor. Every time we dine there, his dishes are simply wonderful.  Well, last year they introduced Brunch at BGLV. We thought it really good, but needing a few changes. Even Mike, who is in charge of the Brunch dishes, admitted that we visited too early, and should return later in the year. Well, the Brunch is only from March until October. We missed his changes. (If we had tons of money, we would have returned, and quite often.)  Well, THIS time around, today, it was a very different menu, and EVERY DISH was astounding. I split dishes with my spouse, and we tried as many as possible, but couldn't get thru half the menu, still going home feeling like pythons after consuming an antelope. But MAN, what we ate!  I don't even need to mention the dishes. EVERY DISH was just sublime. (But the shrimp and grits, those I could eat all day long.) And the $5 bottomless mimosas were great, too, with a huge selection of variations, with things like blood orange juice, pomegranate, etc.  So try the Brunch. You will NOT be disappointed. It's normally $29.99 pp, but as BG LV VIP card holders we got a one-time half-off offer thru the email, ending Mar 25. Look into that, if you are a local Nevadan. But believe me, even without a discount, we WILL return this year, especially if we have friends visiting LV to introduce to this Brunch.",

Their chips, salsas, and margaritas are all very good and the bartenders will mix you up something special if you sit at the bar and tell them what you like. A very good spot hidden by the convention center in Mandalay.",

Who eats crumbly cheese instead of melted cheese on nachos!?  I know for rich people, it either has to look like crap or taste like crap to be fashionable, but when I heard this was a really good Mexican food restaurant, that's what I expected.  They did nail the high end price though, $90 for 2 nasty dishes and $7 for a Corona.  If you want good Mexican food, don't go here, even Taco Bell would be better.  However the benefit is you are inside Mandalay Bay, so go play Blackjack after you throw up and you can win your money back that you wasted on this dump.",

    "text": "Border Grill is located in Mandalay Bay, just down the hall from the wedding chapel.  When I visited, my friends wanted to sit outside on the patio.  One plus is the patio outside is completely covered.  It's almost like a room with just the one wall to the outside missing.  So you get the breeze and the fresh air, but still feel like you're slightly indoors.  Also, the patio overlooks a pool with a stage and you can enjoy whatever live music may be playing.  Another plus is their menu has a lot of different and interesting items from which to choose.  I ordered chicken panuchos, which is black bean stuffed tortillas with chicken.  I've never seen black beans stuffed into the middle of a tortilla before, so that gave it a nice twist.  But unfortunately, the chicken was very dry.  I had to add A LOT of salsa to give it some moistness.     A couple of negatives.  The restaurant has this weird policy that they bring you their special filtered water and pour your glasses, and if they refill your glasses - then they charge you extra.  It's stated on their menu, but the problem I have is - why even bring the water without asking if the table wants it?  And the waiter didn't fill one of the glasses full, and although the person never touched the water - he filled it up to the top when he returned.  This meant we would have been charged, when he never even filled it all the way to begin with!  Sneaky?  You be the judge.  The other negative is, there is no restroom on site.  You have to go somewhere downstairs, which is a little ways to walk.  Instead, I went down the hall to the wedding chapel.  If you don't make eye contact with the receptionist, you can go in and the restroom is right there at the entrance :)",

Not really a sopapilla, but more of an open-face pulled-beef sandwich with coleslaw garnish, vaguely Korean, which made me think that kimchi would have made this even better.  My only gripe is that they err on the side of mild rather than spicy, but I'm not sure you'll care.",

I was a manager for them in 2003-2005 and even though the layout of the second floor has changed the delicious creations in the kitchen have not.  We started off with the queso/ chorizo appetizer. It was so scrumptious that it was gone before we knew it. I had the pina coloda with toasted coconut. Wow what a drink. I love the chicken quesadilla, something I crave! You can not beat the fresh hand made tortillas of Border Grill. We also shared the Border Grill Classics. I wanted my husband to taste the well balanced flavors of the empanada and the sweet corn tamale. They were just as if  had tasted them in the years of my employment.  Thank you Border Grill Mary and Susan. I loved working for you and your flavorful fare did not disappoint and impressed that of my beloved.",

Unlimited Mimosas, great tapas...this isn't a buffet - they are brining you fresh tapas from the kitchen - just pick the things you would like or do what I did - just tell them to steadily bring you things and this beautiful selection of breakfast oriented tapas just keeps coming.  My favorites by far:  the Chilaquiles and the Shrimp and Grits - excellent.  Also love the oyster rockefeller, the fruit cup, and the salmon slider. Sat downstairs by the pool - outside - great people watching because you can see Mandaly's \"Lazy River\"...take your time - I spent 2 hours just casually eating, drinking mimosas, writing.  Also - excellent service - some of the best I have seen in Las Vegas",

If you're a Margarita lover like me, treat yourself to a Cadillac Margarita that is topped with Grand Marnier with lots of extra salt, on the rocks.   I can't say enough about this restaurant. The ambience is killer. The staff is attentive. The ingredients are fresh. It's just the best all around. As a native Southern Californian, this has my LA girl seal of approval for Mexican!",

We tried to sit at the patio, but it was unbearably hot, and we were forced to leave and take our business to another restaurant.  I think Border Grill should warn patrons making reservations that the may be forced to eat on the sweltering patio.  Also we observed multiple \"walk-in\" groups being seating indoors ahead of our reservation (probably at our \"reserved\" table).  I cannot speak to the food at this restaurant, but the service was unacceptable.  Take your money to the many other competitors in the area where they value their customers.",

There was a 30-minute wait, so we grabbed a seat at the bar for some drinks & guacamole. I started with the Blanco margarita and the boy had a Cadillac. I really liked the Blanco, it was crisp and refreshing, everything a margarita should be. The guacamole here was great, it had a heavy lime flavor & wasn't overly spicy, read: very Karen C. friendly.  For dinner, I went with the Fish Tacos Ensenada, and they were delicious! I skipped the beans, and they instead served them with 3 different kinds of rice... all were so flavorful. The boy had the Sauteed Shrimp, which I admit to stealing a decent amount of because it was SO good! The sauce was so flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The only complaint is that the red rice on both of our plates was a little too salty, but other than that, it was great. It definitely isn't crazy authentic Mexican, but that's not what I was looking for, so I'm down with that.   I like the ambiance here, and would have liked to have been sat outside, but there was a huge birthday party so that was a no-go. Very random, but I love the glassware they use. Overall, I'm very glad we checked this place out!",

BUT...the best item i had at border grill today...was the GUAVA CREAM EMPANADA.  yes!  you heard me right...fresh out of the oven...they were apparently a little behind on pastries so this item came out towards the end of our meal. (btw, the service was just average...but good enough to not dock any stars)  saved the best for last right?  everything about it was perfect...the flakiness...the creaminess of the hmm...cream?  and the flavor...omg...the guava just took over my taste buds!  i've never had anything like it before...and sadly, i must go all the way back to vegas to have it again...sigh.  wonderful...everything was just wonderful...i can't compare border grill to any other mexican place i've eaten at...it's just some serious gourmet mexican food that is untouchable...i can't wait to go back!!!",

We had made a reservation ahead of time knowing it would be busy given Memorial day and of course the concert, but alas we still had to wait over 20 mins to be seated... I was so HANGRY!  The hostess' up front were very scattered and overall the restaurant just seemed poorly run.  Our server, however, was very friendly and had great customer service...told us the kitchen was backed-up and apologized by getting us little corn tamales. We ordered a gaucamole and chips, and the guac was very good. Their chips and salsa are also quite good.   Food was otherwise very subpar, but I believe this is secondary to how busy and chaotic the restaurant was. I've heard their brunch is fantastic, so maybe I'll try that next time, but the dinner was very mediocre. I had an order of the fish tacos, and they literally killed the fish - overcooked, dry and flavorless. Same thing with the green rice, which was so dry I kept taking gulps of water in between bites. I couldn't even save the rice with salsa/guac.   Would definitely not come back for dinner....Strip prices and bad food? no thanks! But like I said, the brunch looks amazinggggg...",

I came here once with my boyfriend and then physically dragged my family to Las Vegas and into this restaurant.  $35 all you can eat brunch tapas, $10 for bottomless mimosas. The food list is extensive and everything is made fresh so you can customize to your dietary preferences. There is a rotating selection of mimosas and there were at least 7 choices each time.    Both times, my waiters asked me a few questions about what I liked and then brought out extra dishes that I hadn't ordered that they thought I would like -- spoiler alert, everything is great.  I loved how friendly and knowledgeable the staff was and how they went out of their way to make it a great meal. They also bring out little pastries before your meal that are flaky, tender perfection.    One downside, the bathrooms are far down the hall or down a flight of stairs. If you have mobility issues, that's something to consider before taking advantage of bottomless mimosas.",

Since we were staying at the Delano hotel attached to Mandalay Bay, I wanted to visit this spot then found a deal on travelzoo which also included 2 drinks. We got margaritas which although not overly sweet, I thought the size was small and that they tasted weak. We sat on the covered patio on a 110 degree day, so I appreciated that they brought a carafe of water for the table, as well as bringing refills.   Our waitress/waiter shared service of the patio and were both super friendly. I appreciated that the menu is very clear about GF labeling.

Breakfast fries-holy shit. Steak and fries with an egg cracked on top. Delicious, filling, and messy. 5/5.  Steak and egg-pretty standard preparation, but excellent nonetheless. 5/5  Pigs in a croissant-Holy. Shit. Amazing. The manchengo cheese sauce over chorizo sausage was out of this world, the croissant pastry light and fluffy. 7/5  Double up on the pig in croissant-it was that good. Oj was excellent, coffee great as well. We had several other small plate dishes, but those were the standouts. Glad we ate here and I'll definitely be back again and again!",

I came here for brunch with a few friends and they have an unlimited small plates menu for only $35. You can add unlimited mimosas too for $10. Of course, I did the unlimited small plates and mimosas.  I pretty much tried every item on the menu and everything was really good. My favorties were the waffles, breakfast fries, and pigs in a blanket. You might has well order everything off of the menu because it's unlimited! The food comes out as it's made.   The mimosas were really food. They were definitely heavy handed with the champagne. They have a ton of different flavors and seasonal flavors. They have blood orange (my favorite), passion fruit, prickly pear, mango, pomegranate and more! Some of them lacked flavor and just tasted like champagne, but hey, it's unlimited so who cares!   I stayed here for about 3 hours with my friends just eating and drinking. This is now probably one of my favorite brunch spots!",

    "text": "*THEY DELETED SO REPOSTING**  It's the day after my 21st birthday & we just put all of our things in the car & decided to get something to eat before he drive home. We get to the restaurant and they first tell us the wait will be around 20 minutes. We go to the bar to sit and drink some WATER and food & they kick us out because I didn't have my ID. Yet, the state law in Nevada allows you to stay in a bar section if they serve food at the same hour. I would understand if I went to order alcohol but it was strictly water & instead of going far (the parking structure now where near) to get my purse from the car I decided to wait because they told us that its a 20 minute wait. We waited outside for 40 mins & then after asking 3 different times if the table is ready and getting now more attitude from another employee there, the hostess, we finally get seated. We get the option to sit inside or outside, thought that was odd coming from the fact of it being a 20 minute longer of a wait. We choose inside and there is at least 8 empty tables. 4 of them being dirty with napkins, plates full of half eaten food & old drinks. The food was okay. Although, MY FOOD CAME OUT BEFORE MY WATER. Then when I got my tortilla soup im pretty sure they got a tomato soup can and put it in a bowl and didn't cook it AT ALL and then put it on my table for me to eat. I mean they are \"REALLY BUSY\" so they probably don't have time to cook food while they are busy staring at their dirty tables or maybe they should take the time to take the stick out of their asses. The guy next to us in a suit had a whole tray spill on him. It's been like 30 mins and the other people next to us haven't even got their drink order. I thought customer service was a good thing to get them to return.. But instead of saying it is all because of it being \"busy\"  IF I had the option to give it 0 stars. I would. If you're at the convention at mandalay bay, save yourself and walk over to another restaurant .  As I write this a bunch of glasses just fell and broke too. Haha. Nice.",

Everyone there was awesome - from the wedding planner (Destiny and crew), to the staff.  They allowed us to bring in our own decorations and had many options to choose from.

    "text": "We had a great dinner experience for my last night in Vegas! I had been to the Border Grill in Pasadena (which closed a few years ago) and loved it, so I guess I knew I would like it here before I sat down.  We had reservations for 9:30pm and were seating as soon as we walked in. Our table was in the middle of the room, which was crowded, but the table was large so I was comfortable.   We were brought water immediately and our server got our drinks in maybe 3 min. at the most. They were really busy and the servers seemed to be really on top of it. HONEYDEW MARGARITAS. oh boy.  The waiter told us to try the plantain empanadas, and i didn't need much persuasion. plantains are a favorite, pablano chilis are my favorite and i put cotija cheese on everything, so basically this was a match made in heaven for my mouth! (they also have black beans in them, which i prefer over pinto, but still usually stay away from). The three of us liked them so much we ordered a second serving.   At this point we knew we were in trouble. I was already getting full and we hadn't even had our entrees yet.  Round 3 of margaritas had just arrived as my main course of Chile Rellenos was placed in front of me. The dish comes with rice and beans but I asked them to substitute their mashed sweet potatoes and garlic vegetables instead. The mashed sweet potatoes may have plantains in them too, or something else tangy. They were buttery and hot. I was soooo stuffed about 3 bites in...but I kept going.  My bf ordered Pibil thanks to my recommendation, which is a stewed pork dish. OMG I ate a lot of his. They add cinnamon to their sauce and it really gives the pork a whole new flavor. Its subtle but not just spicy......its aromatic. AND it comes with plantain orange salsa, which was asked for a bowl of because we all loved it soooo much!   My friend had chicken enchiladas, which she always orders. These are hard to do wrong, and usually are good everywhere you get them....even Taco Bell. She likes them with a lot of vegies, which is exactly what she got on top. Corn, peppers, onions, mushrooms......(i am allergic, so I didn't try her dish).   We also foolishly ordered a caesar salad to share. It was really crispy and the cilantro dressing was good, but TOOOOO MUCH FOOD.  Round 5 of margaritas......i don't feel so good and I'm giggling like an english school boy.  time to relax. we let ourselves digest for about 10 mins....then the damn waiter told us about the desserts. and, well......when in Vegas, right?  Mexican Chocolate Pie. GOOD GOD. I died and heaven was in my mouth. Orange Cheesecake. So creamy, so good. I only got a little bite because the boyfriend did not want to share (maybe because I didn't let him try mine.....)  My friend opted not to have dessert and instead played on her iphone. Fool. The dessert was fantastic!!!!   All the food was complex and unique. Its not Mexican, its not Tex-Mex, its not Brazilian, its not Oaxacan, its not Argentinian, nor Peruvian.   Its Border Grill.   P.S.- Even though we were all dressed up and ready to go to out.....we waddled our way back to our room, lay on my bed and watched a movie. I couldn't even take off my shoes.",

We were going to have lunch but he recommended brunch and i am glad we took the bait! The steak and eggs is a must but I suggest medium rare.  The bacon peanut butter jelly biscuit was an unexpected treat.  My Little ones Susie and Jonah were acting up and our server brought some chips and crayons to calm them down.  He really took care of us. Jonah spilt his milk all over the table and into his lap and Alan and his server assistant cleaned it up without hesitation.  A manager stopped by.  She was soooo sweet!  We even had a chef stop by.  I can hardly believe it. We even made a joke about being royalty.  I give this place my highest rating. Make sure you save room for the French toast and churro tots!",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice with my sister-in-law, who is an employee of corporate MGM. Both times were pleasant experiences.  About a month ago I was visiting on business and arrived straight from the airport. The hostesses were very kind and offered to watch my bags while we ate. I really appreciated that because I was exhausted. My bag was safe and sound in the end.  The place was packed due to a small conference going on, but the girls handled the chaos and traffic very well. Shortly after we got seated, our waiter greeted us and brought out their marvelous chips. The chips and dip are probably my favorite thing about this place.  I have only ever tried variations of the tacos (shrimp, chicken, steak, and veggie). My favorite is the shrimp because it's not as filling. Most meals comes with beans and rice. Portion size is perfect and not too overwhelming.  In the middle of our meal, the manager came out and introduced herself. She also thanked my sister-in-law for the work that she does as a corporate employee for MGM. I loved that she did that; it showed a sense of community between the various channels of the whole company (for those of you who do not know, Border Grill is located in Mandalay Bay, which is part of the MGM Resorts group).  The only negative thing I have to say is that when it's busy, it's hard to get the attention of your server. We felt like he didn't service us as much as he could. He wasn't really that present and he didn't check-in on during the meal. When it came time for the check, he didn't notice us trying to get his attention, then we asked a different server who totally forgot that we asked. Finally we saw the manager walking by and was able to get her attention. That would be my only complaint. Otherwise, I really like this place. Keep it up!",

    "text": "The AYCE weekend brunch is great here! I previously tried it at the location inside of Caesars Palace. It costs a few extra dollars at Mandalay Bay ($39 vs. $35), but it's worth the money for the ambiance, especially if you sit outside on a nice day, and the service. The servers are always super friendly here! Our favorites: -green corn tamales:filled with sweet corn -Steak and eggs -campechana: great to put on the free chips -Chicken and waffle: mostly the waffle--a delicate, almost cake-like crumb -parfait: nice way to end the meal (not too sweet)",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise! Had just gotten to Vegas and needed lunch prior to a series of work meetings. Stepped up and it was the odd hour between lunch and dinner. Grabbed a couple seats at the bar.  Ordered a Chardonnay and a Steak salad. My expectations were low, given it's a chain. However, the steak on my salad was delicious. They marinated the steak, so it was flavorful and tender. Plus, they add spiced pepitas, aged manchego with a coriander vinaigrette to the salad. Great taste combo.  Husband was super happy with his margaritas and meal, too.  Staff was friendly and attentive,  Satiated and ready for the evening of meetings.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of the Border Grill for years. The service is always friendly and relaxed.  We started with chips, guacamole and the standard trio of salsas. If I were to complain about something, it would be that the salsas were weak and lacked a spicy kick.  The waiter did bring out a fourth, \"spicier\" sauce, but it, too, was bland.   The star of the menu, for me, is the grilled, sliced skirt steak. Excellent flavor, paired with a delicious flour tortilla ($27).   Please work on the salsas. The fresh chips deserve it.",

    "text": "Last visited when scouting houses in September 2013, that morning compromised by a traffic cop clearly looking to fill a quota, it was alongside a friend met just a few weeks later that Brunch was planned inside Border Grill at Mandalay Bay on Saturday, the return of Chef Mike Minor to the kitchen seeing several new items added to the endless Brunch in addition to several old classics.  Joined by a second location at The Forum Shops since that first visit, a pair of meals there plus one in Santa Monica providing a good frame of reference for Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger's brand of Mexican cuisine, it was after navigating a good bit of the Hotel and Casino en route from Self Parking that guests were checked-in at the hostess podium, Chef Mike briefly seen greeting diners in the upstairs dining room before returning to the kitchen and later visiting downstairs patrons.  Offering both an a la carte plus $38.99 all-you-can-eat option on weekends from 10am until three o'clock, the ability to add bottomless Mimosas, Micheladas and Bloody Marys for just $20 clearly a popular choice, it was deferring Alcohol not once but *five* times throughout the course of the meal that the decision was made to partake in the AYCE Brunch, a basket of Guava Empanada's familiarly starting things off and as good as what one might find in Miami or Mexico while the housemade Tortilla Chips with four Salsas proved tempting throughout nearly two-hour meal.  Receiving 14/16 of the menu's diverse options during the course of the morning, service hit-and-miss with a youthful Hispanic gentleman a bit overzealous while his lanky Caucasian counterpart could not have been more blase if he tried, it was as Tortilla Chips were being presented that a vessel containing plump Shrimp and a vibrant mix of Vegetables arrived, a refreshing opening bite that quickly transitioned to medium-rare Skirt Steak atop crispy Potatoes with smoky Chipotle Sauce and a Sunny-side Egg.  An enormous and intriguing space, the soaring ceilings and walls all painted with both indoor and al fresco seating, it was shortly after Steak that the Two Hot Tamales Shrimp and Grits came from the kitchen, the creamy base and Sustainable Seafood bolstered by Peruvian Pepper Paste while the Chilaquiles spoke well of Border Grill's Chips which remained crisp despite several toppings.  Going sweet for a moment, the coursing left to Chef Minor smartly using fluffy Cinnamon Pancakes to refresh the palate before offering up a fiery blend of Masa and Shredded Chicken, it was in follow-up that Border Grill's Benedict proved to be one of the Brunch's most memorable items, a housemade Cheese Biscuit stacked high with Pork and Pickled Onions plus the expected Egg and Hollandaise.  Adapting to current dining trends by offering a \"Power Parfait,\" the presence of 'superfood' Chia Seeds on menus certainly not common in 2013 and neither adding nor detracting from a fresh Fruit and Coconut Milk in this creamy vegan concoction, it was again with senses freshened that Breakfast Fries and Sliders came next, the typically American pairing given a southwest spin by way fresh Salsa and dried-Pepper BBQ Sauce plus braised Meats including crispy Carnitas and tender Brisket.  The rare 'everything to everyone' menu that still manages to maintain its concept, Border Grill's longtime success likely attributable to precisely that fact while several other \"Mexican\" or \"Latin\" Restaurants on The Strip have struggled, it was with Milliken and Feniger's comforting Bacon Jalapeno PBJ Sandwich followed by Mary's Organic Fried Chicken atop a tiny Waffle soaked in 100% Maple Syrup that savories came to a conclusion, the ingredient quality never in question and frankly remarkable in comparison to Las Vegas' other all-you-can-eat choices.  Wasting nothing more than a few smears of Sauce to this point, Chef Mike complimenting the table's capacity when visiting guests around the room, it was with a sliver of Tres Leches Bread Pudding plus chopped up Churros in Caramel plus Passion Fruit that Brunch neared its finish, the addition of $9 Rice Pudding from the a la Carte Dessert Menu highly recommended, though the portion here seems a bit less bountiful than that served in the Forum Shops with a Pecans and Bananas.  ****Happy to see Chef Minor back in a kitchen showcasing his talents, the ingredient quality and cooking across fifteen plates speaking volumes about both ownership and the man at the stove, those looking for an upscale Brunch option that brings the heat while remaining accessible would be well-advised to stop by Border Grill at Mandalay Bay on weekends, though some consistency in service would make the experience even better.",

    "text": "08.08.2017  We met some relatives here for dinner this evening. I was excited to try this place because I remember seeing these two chefs on TV.   We sat down to wait and was served chips and salsa. Additionally, we ordered the homemade guacamole and queso fundido. The guacamole was very yummy--the avocado was creamy and fresh!  The queso fundido came with three small flour tortillas and was cheesy, stringy and yummy goodness. It was like a make-your-own mini quesadillas appetizer.   Little O had the Kid's Bean and Cheese Burrito with fruit on the side and a watermelon lemonade. The burrito was made with black beans, not refried beans. The burrito was a good size, at least the size of my hand. The watermelon lemonade was lemonade with a watermelon syrup, not to her liking so she switched with her big sister.   H had a Kid's Quesadilla with fruit on the side and a strawberry lemonade. The quesadilla was simple and on the small side. But she was also so full from all the chips, salsa and queso fundido that we had it was the perfect meal for her.   CONFESSION: I had TOO many chips, salsa, guacamole and queso fundido as well so I stuck with two appetizers--grilled octopus and grilled elote (Mexican corn)--for my meal.   The grilled octopus was cooked well, not over done so it was tender. But I wasn't fond of the seasoning and flavors it had. I ended up dipping it in hubby's crema that came with his taquitos.   The elote (Mexican corn) was grilled and had good seasoning. I wish it had more mayo and cheese, though.    Hubby also ate too many chips and salsa so he went with the brisket taquitos. The taquitos were flavorful but the sauce they served over it was too thick and the flavor was overwhelming. It reminded me of enchilada sauce. Then it made the taquitos soggy. Hubby was sad. The meal came with a side of black beans and rice. I usually sample it but as I said earlier, I ate too many chips to even do so. LOL!   Our server, Rachel, was very attentive and patient with our group as we arrived in shifts before we were a complete party of 7. Our water glasses were never empty, the gentleman waiter did his job very well.   I would definitely come back for the chips, salsa, guacamole and queso fundido.",

When they say all you can eat.. they mean it! We were there for about 3 and a half hours enjoying their delicious offerings plus $8 bottomless mimosas. We sat outside near the pool since the weather was perfect and really enjoyed our brunch.   Because there were more than 5 of us they suggested ordering family style so the food would come out a little more quickly so we did and it worked out quite well. After being seated were were automatically brought out some tasty guava empanadas and fresh fruit to much on while we decided on our mimosa flavors (did I mention there were 7 flavors to choose from??) and our first few menu items. We ended up trying 11 of their 22 dishes and some of the favorites were the Shrimp and Grits, Breakfast Fries and Bread Pudding French toast. Almost every dish was in some way super decedent and rich and it worked out perfectly to just have a few bites and move on to the next dish.  Our waitress, Rachel, was amazing. She was super helpful with suggestions and answered any questions that we had. She also amazingly kept up with our mimosa and food requests as well as refreshing our plates, silver wear and water glasses when needed. She also never got tired of us asking her to repeat the mimosa flavors (maybe listing them on the menu would be a good idea).  Great experience and I would definitely choose this over a buffet any day!",

    "text": "Bf and I came here for Restaurant Week. We sat outside in the patio so that we would have a pool view (suggested by one of the yelpers when I was reading the review). It was nice out and a little sticky (humidity was 35%) and they turned on their huge outside fan about an hour later.  I ordered: - Tuna Crudo - Duck Chilequiles - Whoopie Pie and Cinnamon Horchata.   The bf ordered: - Mushroom Empanadas - Gaucho Steak - Whoopie Pie and Cinnamon Horchata  I will have to say that THE BEST DISH we had out of all of them was hands down the Gaucho Steak. OMG, It was the most softest steak I've ever had. That literally melted in my mouth. No chewing for a million years, it was just absolutely freakishly good!  My Duck Chilequiles I was not too impressed with. Barely 2oz of duck and majority of the plate was filled with tortilla chips drenched in like an enchilada type sauce. It did taste good with the meat that I did eat but not worth it because of so little meat.   As far as the appetizers went, the tuna crudo is really good if you eat it with the tortilla chips they give you when you first sit down. Adds extra texture. It's also warmish, not cold which threw me off but still good. The empanadas weren't that bad. I'm not a mushroom kinda person either.   The whoopie pie to me was alright. Bf liked it a lot as it was not sweet and he's had the cinnamon drink before whereas, I've never had it so to me it was eh.   Service was really great up until we finished our 2nd course. Our waiter was no where to be found. The guy who took away our plates also took away the water pitcher and never brought a new one back and my glass was completely empty. It took probably 20+ min before we got our waiters attention to bring our last course and to pack one of them to go.   Other then the slow service at the end, I would definitely come here again and DEFINITELY recommend the Gaucho Steak. That stuff is legit!",

His plate:  Kobe beef tacos, grilled pineapple salsa, guacamole, handmade flour tortilla, black beans  Her plate:  Grilled Skirt Steak (ordered rare), charred corn relish, black beans, handmade flour tortilla  The salsa selection provided is always great - usually a bright verde, a smoky chipotle, and a fresh, light pico de gallo. I had previously marveled at the freshness and flavor in each, and ordered all of Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Fenniger's books so I could make these at home. I'm happy to report that their salsa recipes are easy to make and very close in flavor to the restaurant's. (Look for some recipes on the blog soon!)  The steak here is some of the best I've ever had - and from the two times I've had it before in Santa Monica, I can also report how impressively consistent it is. Great marinade on tender, high quality steak is always a winning combination.  D liked his tacos, though isn't as in love with this restaurant as I am.  An important note, for the Vegas patrons who live on points and rewards - they may be located within Mandalay Bay, but this restaurant is actually independent - you do not earn nor can you use reward points here. Not that it should discourage you from going at all, just good to know!",

To start off the server while attentive, was really not very helpful nor did she try to encourage us to try different things on the menu she was very ... Let's just say short with her answers to our questions.  I ended up ordering the mushroom mulitas. It was a very interesting - essentially mushroom stacked up apparently stuffed with beans and cheese and greens ...But all I could taste was mushroom and I swear there was not a pinch of cheese in the entire dish! which it desperately needed. I ended up ordering a side of tortillas so that I could chop it up and put it in something otherwise it just really didn't feel like a meal more like an appetizer. Overall the concept was there but it was poorly executed. On the plus side their chips and salsa was very tasty.   Again, overall it was not a bad experience, but with all of the dining options in Las Vegas... I would not go back.",

    "text": "I dined at Border Grill for dinner before a Justin Timberlake years and years ago.  This was my 1st time back since then, and a large group (7 of us) dined for brunch on Father's Day.  The restaurant offers an awesome brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.  It's $35 per person for all you can eat small plates and an additional $8 if you would like bottomless mimosas - which is the way to go....I ordered a bloody mary, which was not very good and came in a very small glass and was $11. :(  Anyhow, they didn't offer anything different for Father's Day, which was great.  5 people in our group arrived early and were sat before I (the reservation holder) even got there.  That's all fine and dandy, but kind of weird, because the other 5 people didn't know each other, and I wasn't even there yet.  I don't feel like they should be seating people before the reservation holder is even present.  Whatevs.  Also, there appears to be some sort of construction going on, because a large part of the downstairs was curtained off.  And there was a VERY foul smell - it started while we were in the walkway outside of the restaurant and smelled like sewer.  While it may have nothing to do with the restaurant, it was pretty disgusting.  Our server was very friendly.  She started out by saying that, with larger groups, she likes to serve everything family style, and rather than have everyone order, just send out some of the favorites and most popular items on the menu.  We all agreed that sounded good.  So the food started coming.  Wow, it was delicious and seemed endless.  Some of the things were really good, some we didn't like so much...but each person at the table had varying tastes, so everything was devoured.  The meal started out with some fresh fruit and emapandas and then other items came out from there.  Some of the favorites were: sweet potato pancakes, chilaquiles, breakfast fries, steak and eggs and the bread pudding french toast.  Some of the less favorite items were: shrimp and grits (I liked them, but a few people thought they were too spicy), lobster pancakes (I also like these, but most of the diners were expecting something sweet, because they were pancakes, but they were savory), and the hash and eggs.  Here is an important note: there are eggs on EVERYTHING.  So if you aren't a fan of eggs or have super high cholesterol or something, maybe this isn't the place for you.....  As I said before, the bottomless mimosas are by far the way to go, even if you plan on having only 1.  $8 is a great price, and they had a TON of flavors to choose from.  In hindsight, I wish that I would've ordered these.  There were orange, peach, watermelon (the tables favorite), pomegrante, etc etc.  There was some confusion when it came to the check, because there was auto-gratuity added, although their policy states for \"parties of 8 or more,\" and there were only 7 of us.  Our reservation was originally for 8, but we had 1 no-show.  Although our server was very friendly, she was a bit slow, and I do think we would've tipped more had the auto-gratuity not been on the check already. Or if we had been at least told about it beforehand.  This is one of the better brunch deals in town, based off of the creativity and quality of the food, the atmosphere and of course the cost. $35 per is well worth it!",

    "text": "Border Grill is hands down THE BEST brunch on the strip- and you heard it from me, C. Everet Bruncher the 3rd. Their brunch combines usual breakfast fare- waffles, eggs, hash browns, with southwestern flavors- tomatillos, guava, chills, and then throws it at your face tappas style instead of trough style like many inferior brunch buffets. When I moved to Vegas I had just finished watching the season of Top Chef pro or whatever its called were Mary Sue came in second place so I was extremely eager to try this place. As I walked through the desolate Mandalay Bay (apparently there was no NASCAR event or P Diddy concert, the only things that seem to make this place busy) and got to the restaurant which was only about 1/2 full I started to get a bit worried. Had I wasted the precious calories it took to walk here from self park? That walk took at least 4 minutes and I don't undertake such journeys lightly- too large a risk of orcs.   As soon as we were seated we were brought a trio of regular human salsas and then a 4th devils brew salsa seemingly designed to make GITMO detainees talk. Service was attentive but not annoying, and since for this brunch you are dependent on your server to bring you the food that is crucial as even a 5-10 minute gap could result in a riot.   The menu changes every 2-3 months or so, but it is always around 20 small plate items, 3-4 of which is more than enough to fill up the average person. Combine that with all you can drink mimosas- that come in like 15 different flavors- and breakfast margaritas... which as far as I can tell is just a regular margarita with a little vanilla in it. What a glorious place where you can get drunk at 10am as long as your drinks have a splash of vanilla. America.   Some menu highlights  Pigs in  Blanket- comes with a manchego cheese dipping sauce that I would drink by the glass if possible- BY THE GLASS I say.   Churro Tots- I mean, if you needed me to tell you to order these than there is something seriously wrong with you.  Breakfast fries- basically hashbrowns with three delicious sauces spread around them.   Waffle - I have had this twice, once it came with pork belly which was amazing, the other time it came with \"ham\" which appeared to just be bacon cooked inside the waffle itself. The pork belly was definitely better but I'm not gonna split hairs over a bacon stuffed waffle.   Eggs Benedict- this comes with like picked red onion or picked radish or something on it that sort of taints the dish and makes it all pink. Order without that.  Steak and eggs- great. You prob get a solid 6 ounces of skirt steak with each order. It has a delicious black bean puree underneath it all. A must get.  Oyster Taco- this came with way more vegetables than I was expecting so I just ate the cornbread battered fried Oyster. Would eat again.   Some things to Avoid  Brisket Sliders- these are prepared like a Vietnamese sandwich. You know all those people who when eating good BBQ brisket say \"damn this needs some carrots and cilantro\"... oh wait thats no one.   Fruit Creme Brule- meh, I mean its yogurt, not sure why I ordered this. My b",

The Border Grill was a real find we called ahead but since it was a Tuesday night it wasn't overly busy so we were able to get a table for four right away.   We started out with a nice cocktail while exploring the menu everything looked so good. I started out with the Blood Orange Cerviche this turned out to be a great choice we ordered a mixture of different entrees to share wow this is gourmet Mexican Food. Our server was perfect and we ordered from her recommendations and wasn't disappointed. We found everything we orders delicious and the presentation was over the top. There are so many great places to eat in Vegas we had plans to eat another meal here but that didn't work out. I will definitely bookmark this for future reference if you are in the area and decide to try them out you won't be disappointed",

    "text": "I am officially a fan of buffet style type brunches where you never leave your seat.   You just order off the menu and the food keeps coming.  I do suggest ordering about two to three items at a time and once delivered it's a good idea to let your waiter know what you would like next as the wait for the food can vary.  Add to that you may not love everything you order so you will have options.     Bonus points, this brunch comes with bottomless mimosas in a variety of flavors for an additional $8. My boyfriend and I met our tourist friends here for Memorial Day Weekend.  Even with it being a holiday there was no problem getting reservations and no wait.  My favorite mimosa was the pomegranate but I also loved the watermelon and the strawberry.   The food standouts for me were the steak and eggs and the sweet potato pancakes.  The majority of the items I tried were on the spicy side minus the pancakes.  My least favorite dish was the pork belly waffles.  I like pork belly but this was just a piece of flavorless fat.    If you are a local make sure you sign up with your waiter for the 15% off locals' deal.   We sat inside for this visit but weather permitting I would love to sit outdoors next time.",

    "text": "Use to really love this place but the last couple times have been a real big flop. They changed their dinner menu to ala cart style. So you're paying the same price now but not getting sides. You have to buy the sides (which are family style), but I just can't wrap my head around paying almost $30 for one piece of flank steak. This is Mexican faire right? Where are the rice and beans and sides?!  Then I tried their new revamped brunch. The old brunch was fine but this one was supposed to be better. It really wasn't. And they also decided to make Sunday brunch their training day (for some reason...) which really slowed down service. They ran out of a few options and our waitress kept blaming her team members for everything going wrong. She would bring one or two mimosas out when there were 4 people having them at the table. She made no sense. On top of that we had to ask for menu items 5-6x before getting them. It's a fixed menu, I don't understand how hard it is just to bring the items out. What a drag... won't be doing their brunch ever again. So many better places to grab bottomless brunch on the strip. Try Bally's Sterling Brunch, Herringbone, or the Wicked Spoon instead.",

    "text": "Yup I'm a fan of this place. We made a reservation for a sunday brunch. It didn't seem that busy when we arrived but I still recommend to get a reservation so you get a spot for sure. I would rather come here than any other buffets in Vegas because you don't have to wait at all and it was quite good.   So we decided to try the all you can eat tapas menu which consist of 15(around) items which can vary from appetizers to entrees to desserts. Our awesome waiter was super helpful in telling us what was good and recommend we could do. Since we had a party of 8, he made it easier for us by simply putting it in a family style plate where 4 of us share and the other 4 share. The food really depends on you but I really recommend the Steak and eggs, breakfast fries, and the corn tamales.   Reason why I love the steak and eggs was because it was super flavorful and the steak was actually good quality(and it's all you can eat so go wild man). The breakfast fries were awesome in which it consist of every man's dream...bacon,short rib, fries, cheese, egg....like imagine that into bites of yummyness.  However these two items I mention are super deadly, so my personal favorite that is super light was the corn tamales. I personally think it's adorable how they wrapped the tamales. THey provide you with sour cream and salsa. It's not a lot in the tamales but it's really good and light.   Then there was our awesome waiter, Mike, that was super attentive and friendly towards us. He made small talk, he helped us a lot with the menu, and I simply befriended him(I wasn't even drunk). So the extra star is for our waiter who made me enjoy my time at Border Grill A LOT more.   There it is people...I recommend giving it a try especially if you're not down to wait 2 hours for a damn buffet.",

Great dishes including a red Chile rubbed chicken but that's no longer in the menu.   Very slow on a Thursday night. Margaritas were pretty good.  Chips and guacamole were tasty but way salty. Their Yucatan pork was all over the place. 2 people said theirs was really dry, while mine was almost in a chili Colorado tasting soup puddle. Really was a disappointing meal on every level. Somebody needs to mind the store here - quality is not even good Mexican fare let alone elite. Sadly don't think I'll ever go back.",

Our last visit was on last Sunday.  The girls in the front were friendly and welcoming!  Our waiter, Mike was the best part of this Vegas trip!  He was friendly, helpful, professional and has the best sense of humor.    We ordered... Green corn tamales - Perfection!!! Short Rib Enchiladas - Tender, Fresh and Delicious!!! Tres Leches Cake - BEST EVER!!!  Washed it all down with my Margarita and the hubby had a Carona.  Everything was delicious but the Tres Leches has got to be the best thing ever!!!  It's great for dates, groups and families.  They have seating inside and outside.  Looking forward to our next trip to Border Grill!",

It was pretty quite when we got there at 10am on a Saturday, but by 1pm when we left (yes, we brunched for 3 hours but wouldn't you if the mimosas just kept coming?!?) the patio was full.  Our table looked directly out on the pool and palm trees on THEhotel.  Our server was very attentive, telling us about the option of either ordering from the regular lunch menu or getting the brunch, which consisted of your choice of 22 tapas-style brunch items ($34.99) to which you could add unlimited mimosas ($8) in a variety of flavors including pomegranate, lemon ginger, and apple basil.  Of course, having done our research, we chose the tapas brunch, each starting with 2-3 small plates and progressing until we tried nearly all of the 22 dishes among the three of us.  The brisket hash, churro tots, potato tacos, and manchaca benedict were some of our favorites, but really none of the dishes we had were bad.  We sampled all of each other's dishes and no one left hungry.  The server did not rush us and we enjoyed several rounds of mimosas after the meal, making for a great start to the weekend!!    It's truly a gourmet dining experience in a relaxed atmosphere.  The food was incredibly fresh, artfully presented with attention to detail, and was very flavorful. I loved this place and definitely planning on returning in the future. It's well worth the price!",

Added the endless Mimosas to it. Left the place full and with a nice little buzz. Our server (who's name escapes me unfortunately) was extremely attentive. He constantly checked on us despite it being rather busy. Being that we had the endless mimosas, he would bring out new flavors even if we didn't ask for them whenever the table next to us (who had a larger party) would get more drinks. He was helpful with the menu and everything came out quickly.   As for the food, keep in mind that the plates are really small. I was fine with that since the service was good and it was endless. My favorite dish was the cinnamon roll pancakes. I also had the chicken and waffles (pretty good), bbq brisket torta (meh), churro tots (decent. passion fruit spread was a unique twist), and the campechana  (refreshing) I also had the chips with variety of dips. The chips they bring to the table were maybe the best I've ever had. No hyperbole.   Overall, I enjoyed myself. I left full and buzzed and happy. Server was great. I definitely want to come back and try the Chile Relleno Burger whenever I return to Vegas.   sidenote: The bathroom is really far. You have to go downstairs and walk for a while. Not a big deal but I wish I knew before I guzzled down mimosa after mimosa lol. Also, we sat in the dining room but near the door for outside seating and it was FREEZING cold. I had to keep my winter hat on",

This past Friday night, I was invited by a friend to attend the Tequila Dinner sponsored by Casa Noble Tequila at Border Grill, which I understood was really the first dinner event since Minor returned there.  To say I was amazed was an understatement.    The cocktails from Casa Noble were all delicious.  But Minor and the menu he came up with stole the show.  Each of courses were uniquely different from each other, showcasing great care for the variety of ingredients, Oaxacan spices.  The appetizers, the roasted beet salad, the hamachi crudo, the short ribs, the pepita crusted lamb chops, and above all the duck carnitas with fig mole and fennel. It was one of the best food experiences I've had in this town, without costing $1K.  And then there is Minor. Truly a class act. Minor took great pride in all of his staff, all of whom provided excellent service.  But he also spent time with guests, and was extremely personable. Can't wait to go back.",

I am from Salt Lake City but have also lived in California and Texas and I have eaten more Mexican food from more Mexican restaurants than any other type of quinine. Fred's Mexican in California and Sonora Grill in Ogden Utah are every bit as good if not better than Border Grill and the cost is around a third of what it is at Border Grill. It was obvious to me that when you eat at a restaurant inside of a casino in Vegas you are really paying for convenience and atmosphere, not necessarily a culinary experience.  My advice to you if you are reading this review is to save the cash for the shows and gambling, eat at Chilis or any other decent place and then you won't be disappointed.",

We had asked for separate checks, and when we paid we had expected change back. My friend put in a 20.41 in one check for a drink that cost 5.41 and asked for another check for the meal cost. As the check came she paid for the meal which was around 21 dollars. As the waitress came back, she said she was 2 dollars short on the whole check, which didn't make sense cause we needed 15 dollars change back, since we put in around 41 dollars when our meal cost around 27 dollars. To make matters worse, my friend ordered a VIRGIN pina colada which costs 6 dollars, but they charged her card 11 DOLLARS which is the actual Alcoholic beverage price. None of us drink since we are all underage so it didn't even make sense to us. On top of that, as we went to another waitress to complain because they had told us our waitress had left, she told us that they were annoyed because we tipped only 7 percent when the average was 15. FIRST OF ALL, SOME OF OUR CHANGE that we needed to get back which was over 20 dollars in total that we lost was going towards the tip. The waitress shouldn't have even MENTIONED the fact that that was a problem because we lost over 20 DOLLARS at this restaurant. The waitresses were being really rude to us and didn't even seem to care for our problems.",

You mean I can't get a table at Fleur de Lys? Well I don't want to eat at the buffet again...screw it, let's go to Border Grill.   It is not that the food is bad, or the decor lacking, it's just well, ordinary. The prices are Vegas prices...no not $5.99 prime rib Vegas prices... more like $23 fish tacos Vegas prices. Not exactly the best value for a quick and casual sit down dining experience.   We decided to come here because well, we had reservations at Aureole that we missed because I unfortunately had to keep working about 2 hours past the time I was set to take a dinner break. So what was a 2.5 hour dinner break turned into about 40 minutes to eat something fast. Since this location is close to the convention center at Mandalay Bay, and they have an area in the bar where you can eat quickly, we settled on this.  The food was good, but not great. Thankfully the server was attentive and when we told her we were in a bit of a hurry, she was certain to speed things up for us. Overall, our dining experience was not disappointing but it would certainly not be my first choice for a nice sit down dinner at the Mandalay Bay hotel.",

With that, we both agreed that Border Grill was probably the best meal we've ever had!!  It was our first meal in Vegas, and we were hungry and thirsty.  Our waitress, Carmie, suggested the brunch tasting menu and some fabulous drinks.  So happy we listened to her.  Everything we tasted was phenomenal and our drinks were on point.  The steak and eggs, tres leches french toast, serrano ham waffle, churro tots...MmmMmmM.... to die!!!!!!!!!!  Carmie was an excellent waitress!!!  She was personable and professional.  We can't wait to return.",

It was a great place, took us a min to find in the Mandalay hotel but once we did we were pleased. Sat immediately with smiling faces and sat at a nice table. The decor was contemporary, I loved the glassware.   Chips and salsa were good but could've been better (salsas just weren't to my liking-personal preference) they were too...um...watery? I like thick/chunky salsas but then again maybe it was good so I didn't fill up on them because the chicken quesadilla I ordered was great, my boyfriend ordered the beef tacos, delicious! had cadillac margaritas too...can't have mexican food without a margarita! :)  We'd definitely go back.",

Now...does not remembering what I ate mean the food was forgettable, or does it simply mean that I killed one too many brain cells this weekend. I'll let you make that decision (one is far more likely than the other).    Something that I always fret about are serving sizes. Serve me a massive plate of food with only a little of what I ordered and like 90% rice won't make me happy, but serve me a dish with a generous helping of shrimp on a bed of rice and greens and I'm a happy camper. I'll camp here more often.",

I could be totally off and maybe this is quite common in Vegas, but this is the first time I was charged for tap water at Vegas. Grrrr....  Anyway, we stopped by for some light bites. The chicken and steak quesadillas were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the fresh fruit sangria which happened to be blueberries and raspberries that day. It was super carbonated and tasted like a fizzy blueberry soda, but maybe you like your sangria like that. I don't. Plus, they do not offer pitchers. Goodness, of all places in the world, why must you not have pitchers? My favorite of the night was the Watercress, Avocado, and Orange salad that came with bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese. It was sinful I tell you. The salad was light and delicious and balanced out the heaviness of the bacon wrapped dates very nicely. Just for the salad, I might forgive you Border Grill for the whole water fiasco, but I won't forget.",

I'm talking about the Two Hot Tamales: Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger! Anyway, they are the masterminds behind Border Grill.  This location (there's at least one more that I know of in Pasadena, CA) is in the beautiful Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, on the Sin City strip. It's kinda tucked way back in the hotel, but I'll travel out of my way just to eat here.   Anyway, I love this place. I was walking through the casino one night with my wife and I saw a sign pointing down towards no man's land. I thought the name sounded familiar and remembered the Two Hot Tamales from TV. Lo and behold, this was, in fact, the same Border Grill I'd tried in LA years ago. This place was a whole lot different than what I'd experienced in LA though. This place was hipper, funkier, more colorful, and in Vegas for cryin' out loud! Woo-hoo! Vegas, baby!  Border Grill serves up some righteous Mexican/Southwestern/Cuban fusion-hybrid food that has my mouth watering just thinking about it...mmmm... We started our meal with complimentary chips and salsa. However, the salsa was an experience in itself. We received a trio of salsas that were excellent. I'd write more about them, but I don't recall what was in them (roasted tomatoes, chipotle peppers, tomatillos...something like that). It may have also been the tasty mojito and margarita I had before the meal that altered my memory of the meal...*hic!*  Our entrees were delicious as well. I ordered a steak (well-seasoned and juicy) while my wife ordered the carnitas. Both dishes were so good that we couldn't stop talking about it the next day. Maybe if we had won some money we could've gone back for more. Oh well...  I highly recommend Border Grill for anyone staying in the Mandalay or within a 100-mile radius of Las Vegas. I can't wait for my next meal here...",

This is crazy psuedo-mex from Miami or something. The only people they could fool are east-coasters and Las Vegas convention goers who get lured in by passing through all the time.  Everything tasted like lime. The corn tortillas were a pasty, dry mess and terribly under salted or not salted whatsoever. It's hard to imagine a mexican place that can screw that up. The truth is, however, real mexicans could not have had anything to do with concocting the food served here. This place exists to sell cocktails and $6 lime ades.   If you're going to eat at Mandalay, head over to Burger Bar not too far away. If you're looking for mexican, go elsewhere.",

The food was ok. My wife and I ordered the fish tacos and veggie quesadilla to share. The tacos were practically flavorless while the quesadilla had good flavor with cheese and poblano inside, but it was so overstuffed with corn pieces.

Exceptional service, and uber friendly staff all around, from greeters, servers, to bartenders. We had zero wait and almost had the whole restaurant to ourselves since we had the first seating available at 10:00am. It was frying outside already, we sat indoors.  Really good food though. Sharon kept the food coming with a \"Surprise us\" request. We tried most everything. Both the wife & I loved the shrimp & grits best. It had a near-perfect blend of richness and heat. The wife liked the sweet corn tamales 2nd best, followed by the chicken tamales. My next 2 favorite dishes were the Breakfast Fries followed by the crunchy and tangy Chilaquilles.  Wife tried the unlimited mimosas for $10 but was greatly dissppointed in the lack of flavoring.   Definetly 4 stars here. Would've given 5 stars if the food had actually been a little hotter, rather than just a little warmer than lukewarm.   Worth a try!",

Each item on the menu sounded absolutely mouthwatering that you wanted just say \"screw it!\" and order everything.   But then you learn which plates are good and which, well, suck.  Salmon Slider: Smoked salmon isn't my favorite, but when combined with other ingredients like goat cheese and jalapeno bacon, it's delicious. This would've been perfect, but sadly the bun was dry.   Chicken and Waffle: Meh. The blue corn waffle was dry, and there was a lack of sweetness that I was expecting -- it is chicken and waffles after all. At least the chicken was crunchy, and I really digged the hotness of the mango habanero coulis.   Egg White Oysters Rockefeller: I should've ordered 20 of these because this was the best thing I ate. I loved the creamed spinach and the tempura battered oyster.   Breakfast Fries: Rich. The fries were soggy-crispy. Blame it on the wetness of the short braised rib and chipotle hollandaise sauce.  Steak and Egg: I ordered the steak at medium-well, which was perfect. Except, the steak was very salty when I first bit into it.   Service - The waitstaff was attentive, but it took forever to bring out our food. Yeah, I get it, each item made-to-order, but what's annoying is when not everyone's food is brought out all at once. It's awkward having to play that game where you want to eat your food, but you also want to wait for the other person to receive theirs. There were just too many moments when our waitress had to check on our orders for us.   Overall - I'm giving Border Grill a 3.5. Brunch is hit or miss, unfortunately. If I ever return, I'll probably skip the brunch option and order off their regular lunch or dinner menus.",

    "text": "(Dined for lunch on 7/4/14)  Understandably popular and busy Tex Mex located down the events center corridor in Mandalay Bay. It's been here since day one of the resort, which says they're doing something right. It's a nice colorful interior and it feels airy despite the fact that there are a lot of tables. Things are placed just far enough apart that you feel part of a group without your neighbor being in your lap.  We went the taco route for lunch and they were quite tasty, with the spicy shrimp being the standout. On the three-taco plate, you can mix and match types. The plates come with black beans as well as white and green rice. The chip basket that comes to the table has three salsas, all tasty. When our waiter noticed that we liked the spiciest best, he brought us a dish of another, even hotter salsa to try, which made for a nice personalized touch. In fact, he gave the impression that he genuinely cared about our dining experience. He took care to lead us through the extensive margarita list and gave us some good advice and was correct in his recommendations--the margaritas are delicious! His extra time paid off for him too, since we each tried two margaritas based on his descriptions. The ultimate tariff is kind of high for this type of food, but the quality is on the high end and, of course, it's in a resort.",

So delicious! Not your average options either- banana foster French toast, churro tots served with strawberry and prickly pear dipping sauce, Peanut butter, jelly and Jalapeno in a fresh biscuit... My mouth is watering as I relive the options    And as good as the food is, the service is what makes this place special!  We've had the privilege of having Rachel for two of he visits... She's been with the store since they opened and there is a reason for this! This lady KNOWS how to serve and treat people!   I eat vegetarian and she would modify the brunch menu orders to accommodate this. She actually gave me ideas on what items to order! Her timing is perfect on bringing food, checking in, making warm small talk, etc. my wife and I have been SUPER impressed  A couple bits if info about this location. It's buried in the WAY back part of Mandalay Bay where the convention center is. Walk past Fluer, Light, Starbucks, etc... When you think you've walked too far, you'll find it :-)   They are opening a new location located directly on the strip at Ceasars and this one will stay open. They have indoor and outside seating. The outside overlooks the lazy river.   The only negative (for me) is I've noticed the vegetarian and vegan options disappearing from the menu. Meat is being added (almost unnecessarily) to items. If you don't care, this won't matter. For me it does.   I'll be back for sure. I hope they adjust the menu trend so I can come back many more too!  Also, if you sign up to their email club online, you will get a buy 1 get 1 entree free for use within the next ?30-60 days (don't quote me on the length)  Please thumb up/comment if you liked this review and I would count it a privilege if you chose to follow me as I review places I travel and visit. Thank you for taking the time to read! ~mp",

    "text": "Oh Border Grill, how sad am I that you, somehow, inexplicably, don't have a location in the Bay Area.  We would welcome you with open arms!  I would single handedly pay your rent for a year the first month out!    There's not just one thing that sticks out about Border Grill, but it's a culmination of everything, executed to perfection.  The drinks are imaginative, strong, sweet, spicy, tangy, whatever you want them to be.    The food kind of sucker punches you with how exceptionally delicious it is.  I mean, I knew it'd be good, but not that good!  Shouts of \"WHAT IS THIS?!\" accompanied by vigorous head nodding could be heard echoing throughout the restaurant with each bite of my plantain empanadas.   The Oaxacan strip steak is as delectable as it is huge.  And if that mesmerizing mole doesn't win you over, you don't stand a chance against the wild mushroom quesadilla. Not. A. Chance.  If you're as undyingly full as we were but stubborn enough to force down a dessert because everything else was so amazing you could never live with yourself without having tried it, they do two half portions of any of the desserts so you can \"share\" but still get the one you want!  Fair warning: the half portions are pretty much as big as a full portion anywhere else.    The service is effortless.  Ryan was awesome; he knew the menu inside and out, made some great recommendations, and gave us good tips for ordering.  Someone give the guy a raise!  The ambience is perfectly cool and casual, so we felt totally welcome to take our time ordering, just sit back and lounge and keep the drinks on coming.  And all this for way less than it has any right to be!    I'm just so angry!  Where are you back home when I need you, Border Grill?!",

We then get our meals but can finish it. After we were done eating we still had a half plate of food left on 2 plates server comes by ask if we're done we say yes but want to take food to go but jus grabs plates & stacks all plates on the food we were gonna take didn't even ask if we wanted to take to go. so then we get the bill and they charge for water.

    "text": "We came to LV with a toddler and we wanted something close to our hotel (Four Seasons) without having to walk through like 3 smoky casinos. I also wanted to make reservations online. Border Grill fit the bill.  We ate at around 5:30 so while the place was filling up fast, it wasn't super crowded. As such, service was good and the staff were friendly and efficient. We opted to sit outside on the patio and looking back, I probably wouldn't have gone for this. I mean, the weather was nice but it was so incredibly loud on the patio between the drunken yelling from patrons to the intense bass coming from the patio below the restaurant (or somewhere nearby).   The prices were a bit higher than your average Mexican place (especially for the ambiance and the crowd). They were fine dining prices minus the fine dining crowd and atmosphere. That being said, the entrees were tasty. We tried the crab ceviche and the jalapeno slices were not a good addition since they were so spicy that if you ate that in a bite, it overpowered the delicate crab. In addition, it was topped with pink peppercorns and that was an odd choice both texturally and flavor-wise. I think I would pass on this in the future unless they change the recipe (which is doubtful).   I went with the garlic butter scallops and shrimp and this was done really well. The sauce was a light buttery sauce and the huge scallops and shrimp were on top of couscous. The scallop was cooked perfectly and very tender. My husband had the skirt steak and it was cooked about medium/medium rare and also very tender. The server suggested treating it like a fajita with flour tortillas on the side, but if you're avoiding grains, you can totally eat it with the tortillas. The chips and salsa options were good and not too spicy. My child has a huge grilled chicken breast with rice and beans from the kids menu (which was a great value at $8) but my husband mentioned the beans were a bit salty.",

    "text": "Be very careful about asking for price clarifications!  The busser brought chips, salsa and water.  When he put the chips down, he asked if we would like a little guacamole too.  Little is the key point, as it was served on a plate the size of coffee cup saucer; yet, we found a charge for almost $10 on our bill!!!  They should ask if you would like to \"order\" some guacamole - the verbiage makes quite a bit of difference.  We had the same problem when ordering our meals.  The server, who was very nice, asked a child (young teenager) in our group if he would like rice and beans with his lunch, to which he said \"yes.\"  The meal was so large that he never touched them, but we found a charge for $5 on our bill for them.  What the heck?  Again, it should have been clarified that they were extra, as many Mexican restaurants don't charge extra.  One person in our group requested rice IN her meal, and instead was brought a side of rice (for which we were charged another $5).  We requested that the charge for the side of rice and beans that weren't touched be removed from the bill since we didn't know they were extra and they weren't touched.  The two young teens ordered the same thing, which turned out to be HUGE.  It would have been more professional of the server to mention how large the serving was and recommended that maybe they share one.  Either the staff at Border Grill is trained to be very sneaky, or they have no clue about semantics.  Even in Vegas, a $120 bill for lunch in this type of restaurant is obnoxiously high.  The food was good, but Border Grill lost these customers since they are sneaky and not as professional as they should be.",

We had a sample platter to split with three dishes: Chicken panuchos, green corn tamales and plantain empanadas. The plantain empanadas were by far the best of the three. Basically, the exterior of the \"empanada\" is a seared plantain stuffed with a cheesy black bean mix. It is topped with a spicy sauce and a generous amount of crema. Delicious. I could have eaten a whole platter of these.  The other two dishes were weaker. The green corn tamale was more like a polenta in terms of texture. The flavor was good but a bit sweet even for me (I love sweet). Still, topped with crema and salsa it was tasty enough.  But the chicken panuchos were inexcusable. The chicken was utterly flavorless. The avocado was nice and the radishes added a much needed bit of brightness but the chicken was so lackluster that it dragged down the whole dish.  The complimentary salsas were also weak: none of them had any spice and at least two of them were extremely bland.  Service was friendly and efficient. Cocktails were delicious and standard  Vegas prices.  A fine place for a quick casual bite but nothing to write home about.",

I had their specialty Yucatan Pork, which I sent back because it was too dry to eat, and it took a LOT of negotiations with the server to remove it from the bill, although they did later.  They came back and told me the Kitchen said it was perfect - - - every time I watch Top Chef and if the customer isn't happy, then why in the hell argue with me?  We sat on the enclosed balcony which was a little cold, although they had heaters.  However all the servers used the doors closest to the table which were seated and each time they entered and exited, cold wind blew in.  I asked the Servers if they could use the doors on the other side of the wall where no one was seated so that the cold air would not blow on us, but they would not.  The Server did her best to comfort us, and it took THREE attempts to get a hot cup of decaf coffee and all I heard about was excuses.  When I did get a hot cup of coffee the cream was spoiled and curdled in the coffee.  So would I return?  No.  Top Chef?  Yeah right.  The restaurant doesn't practice what it preaches.  With the quality of restaurants in Vegas, and those I haven't had the opportunity to eat at, I would rather try something new then come back again.  I find it extremely arrogant to make a play off Top Chef when it doesn't live up to its name.",

If you are staying at Mandalay Bay or THEhotel you HAVE to go to Border Grill.  Prices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.    The service was also amazing.  We had a group of 10 and it was very fast even with the large group.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.    Overall the food is inventive and delicious.  If you are in Las Vegas you should definitely try Border Grill especially for the brunch.  AMAZING!",

    "text": "The NYE prix-fixe, four-course menu with champagne was a tremendous bargain and unbelievably satisfying. The oxtail tamale was so good...I'm telling every abuela I know to start making these! The beef tartare and mushroom empanadas were both outstanding as the second course. The dessert...the blueberry ginger tres leches cake was good on the outside cake part, but the blueberry ginger tasted neither of blueberry or ginger. However, that didn't detract from the cake. The entree had some issues, some related to the kitchen and others related to the service.  The biggest problem we had was with our server. Several times during the meal we had no silverware or water, and he didn't notice until we flagged him down. Then, my entree -- an amazing 22-ounce porterhouse -- came out medium to medium-well instead of the med-rare I ordered. He didn't seem to even notice that it was cooked incorrectly when I showed hi. (it was gray in some parts...GRAY!). I told him if it would take too long, to bring me the short rib instead (it looked great on other tables). A few minutes later, he said it wouldn't take long to fire a new steak. At least 15-20 minutes later, a manager delivered it and apologized profusely. My dining partner was already done eating his steak...not a great way to spend NYE. The filet of the porterhouse was phenomenal, but the NY. strip steak, which was chile-rubbed, still lacked flavor and needed either a sauce or butter finishing. Too much meat to have not enough flavor. Not to mention, what was that horrendous corn cake/casserole slice served on the side? It was...pretty disgusting. I didn't let it ruin an otherwise good meal, but it made absolutely no sense next to a beautiful steak.",

We sat outside on the patio and it was nice to watch folks at the pool and enjoying the scene of the great beach and pool area Mandalay Bay has.  Food wise I really liked it.  I'll be first to say I have no clue what real Mexican food is so I can't say if this even comes close.  However, walking into it I knew it would be different than the Mexican we have in Atlanta.  We started out with Queso Fundido and it was good.  Very much different than the Queso i'm use to.  But, good none the less.  Also, got Pomegranate Halibut Ceviche.  OK this was to die for.  I loved the flavor the Ceviche had.  As for Lunch I had Steak Nachos and they were very good and filling.  Again everything was very different than I'm use to but, very good if you know this ahead of going.  We got Ceviche, Queso, 2 Nachos, Cochinita Pibil, Chicken Adobo Quesadilla, and a few drinks we split the tab and each of us paid $37.63 with tip included.",

CLEARLY they don't check in on this place and they should. Giving a one star is generous as I don't have the zero star option. We started with a margarita, which was not good at all. My husband got a mojito and it was un drinkable. In fact, we sent it back three times. Finally the manger, Ryan, came by the table with the fourth one, which was only passable. When he inquired about our food we told him it was mediocre at best and he seemed shocked and only replied really maybe three or four times...he didn't seem interested in righting the situation. We stopped after we had their chorizo fondito, which was lackluster - banal and boring. We also had their signature appetizer dish - the tamale was unlike any I've had - not held together and cloyingly sweet. The empanada on the plate was okay and the chicken app was beyond tasteless. Needless to say I didn't waste my calories on it. Alas, it was a chip and salsa lunch. And, well folks, they weren't good either....sadness! I say these two need to hire someone who has their best interests in mind to manage this place.",

    "text": "I'm really surprised at how all over the place the reviews are. Makes me feel lucky they were \"on\" during our dinner, because we had a really terrific meal all around. The waiter was friendly, patient, and helpful. One person at my table was having a hard time choosing between entrees so he brought out samples of the two sauces -- that's just one example. Suggesting without \"up selling\" is a talent and he had it. Runners were equally friendly and helpful, etc. The only exception was the hostess, a young girl who was so apathetic and unhelpful that I'm thinking she was doing her job at gunpoint. When we left I thanked her (forgetting momentarily what a bad first impression she'd given) and she didn't even look up from her Kindle, much less respond. Must have been an awesome book, maybe \"How to Alienate Potential Customers.\"  Margaritas were on the light side, True, but tasty and it was 100 degrees on the patio so probably just as well they weren't loaded. One of my friends had a fresh cherry mojito that is literally the best mixed drink I've ever tasted. Ingredients so fresh I momentarily rethought my hatred of rum.   Chips were fresh and the 3 salsas were wonderful but the Guacamole wasn't a star. I don't need or expect tableside fresh guac but there was way too much lime in it, which makes me think they keep it around a while. I tasted lime rather than avocado, bad news.  We were warned portions were huge (thanks again, mr. waiter) so we skipped apps and went straight to the entrees. I had the carnitas, which had amazing flavor and were served over black beans and some kind of mashed quinoa that were like light, buttery mashed potatoes. The combo was delicious and unique. The portion was indeed enormous and I only was able to get through half of it. Friends had the poblano enchiladas and the taquitos. The enchiladas were yummy, the closest I've had north of the border to a certain preparation I've had in Mexico City. The taquitos were a little bland but only by comparison.   Sorry for the limited review, but we were stuffed after that! Prices were high-ish, but compared to other (lesser) Vegas chef joints it seemed reasonable. 3 of us left buzzed and very full for $150 including a generous tip.   As I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm no world food expert, but I do know Mexico Mexican, so a note about \"authentic\" Mexican: Mexico is a huge country with many regions and styles of cooking. Your local place in Minnesota or San Diego may be run by Pueblans, Campechans, or Baja Californians, who have their own ideas of what Mexican food is, and no doubt they've changed the food to suit Yanqui palettes, or just because it's more difficult to find certain ingredients. (If I hear one more Californian tell me only THEY know what \"real\" Mexican is, I'm gonna nuke the San Andreas fault. The Californian Mexican I've tried is a very specific import from Baja and border states that isn't representative of much of the country's cuisine.) I go to Mexico City about 1-2 times a year and Border Grill is somewhat like upscale restaurants in that city, though maybe more varied (DF restaurants tend to be more regional while Border Grill is all over the place). Thus I found Border Grill more \"authentic\" than many places I've tried that are run by 1st-generation Mexicans. Just saying.",

The food was good but not great and not what I expected from two Top Chef Masters.  The good -  Service was very, very good.  The margaritas and cocktails, in general were fabulous and the guacamole was among some of the best I have tasted.  One of my guys had the oxacan strip steak and said it was delicious.  Now the bad -  I had the taquitos and they were tasteless and small.  My husband had the fish tacos and his verdict was that they were \"OK\" but no better than what he can get at home (which is Dayton Ohio - a far piece from the border).  I forget what my Son had but he agreed with my husband that the food was just good but nothing he could not get at home.  That would be OK but this place was pricey for what we got.  Now for the ugly - The place was dirty and the seating was uncomfortable.  We were also promised a \"view\" when we elected to sit on the patio; however, the only people who get a view are the ones who sit in the very front of the patio.  We were at the very back of the patio. The overall appearance of the place just seemed to be chaotic and disorganized.  Not an enjoyable experience at all.  We will not be visiting again.",

I tried the chicken panuchos and loved the green and red rice, very tangy and seasoned. The guacamole and tortillas stuffed w/black beans make it more filling than the plate looks.  Didn't have the energy and tolerance to break in my first drink at 102 degree weather, but settled for the pomegranate limeade, which was very delicious. Don't worry, I met my drink quota later that nite at Mandalay Place, hehe! But we really loved the patio seating. Great ventilation and overlooks the lazy river pool.

Fresh handmade tortillas and really GOOD salsas. Grilled chicken tacos were tasty and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend them if you're looking for a place to have lunch or casual dinner.",

The restaurants is classy with a California vibe. We got the complementary chips with the 3 salsas, salsas were OK, chips were fresh! We asked for a spicy sauce and got a good kick in the butt with the habenero chillies. Ordered bunch of appetizers - out of which the baja ceviche rocked, fresh fresh seafood. The other trio of appetizer included plantain empanadas (OK), corn cream tamales (too sweet) and the chicken tacos (best yet!). We also got the Mexican soup, nice! All in all the food was good but not crave worthy. Service was excellent with water refills, recommendations and offering of hot salsa. Best part of got 15% discount for being CA natives, go CALIFORNIA!",

The meal itself comes with half a chicken, roasted purple potatoes, carrots and pickled onions.  The second was the Yucatan Pork. It was a little too greasy, but the flavor was good because the pork is roasted on a banana leaves. The dish also comes with a side of black beans, red rice, a small scoop of guacamole and corn tortillas.",

All you can eat brunch + mimosas totaled about $60 a person (40 for ayce, 15 for aycd). If you ordered food and bottomless mimosas separate, the mimosas were $30. Brunch food cuts off at 3:00, reasonable, so we ordered fast -- but drinks could go all day.  They used to bring mimosas to you, now they leave a bottle of champagne off at your table and leave you sides of juices to choose from, which was was convenient. The steak and eggs were my favorite, steak was very tender. My friend enjoyed the dynamite chicken (secret menu of the day) and the cinnamon roll pancakes.    If it wasn't for our sever Luis, I don't think the experience would've been super great. We probably won't return because of the food versus the price and quality.   Also for mimosas - all the photos show mango, prickly pear, apple, pomegranate -- these are all discontinued. They only have orange juice, peach, passion fruit, or blood orange",

I had the Yucatan pork and it was delicious. Smokey, sweet and oh so dork tender. I love plantains so was excited they were included with the meal. They were a little too sweet for me, but I enjoyed the caramel ones goodness. The rice and beans were just okay. I believe it was $26  My friends loved their brisket taquitos ($18) and their duo Chile rellenos ($21)  The blood orange lemonade and white peach lemonade were delicious but a hefty $5.00 each with a $2.50 refill which we didn't partake.  They do charge for water here which is .50 a person.  They bring you delicious tortilla chips and a trio of salsas with it which include tomatillo and chipotle. The first was complimentary and was delicious.  Service was prompt and friendly with the exception of the hostess who seemed a little snobbish, but our waitress was great.  Yelp offered a free green Chile tamale appetizer on check in, but it is no longer on the menu.",

Some of y'all sophisticated and wealthy yelpers out there might not bat an eyelid. But if I'm paying for my wife (which I did) and sister, this meal gets expensive real quick.  That being said, the food was definitely above average. Some kind of Mexican fusion--i don't know what it's fused with, but it's more fancy than your basic beef burrito joint on the street corner. I can't lie though, my mind wasnt blown. I don't really know what 25 dollar mexican fusion is supposed to taste like, but I'd expect to be at least as good that I remember what I ordered. I ate here less than 10 days ago and I forgot what I ate.  I think it was some pulled pork thing.  We were seated outside. Ceiling fans kept us cool and considering that we're talking Vegas in June, I was actually pretty comfortable.  Waitress was attentive and friendly enough.  They start off with the complimentary nachos and 3 kinds of salsa. This was actually pretty good. Didn't drink any of the adult beverages, just asked for water. Server asked if we wanted bottled water or \"regular\" water. We got regular. Water was brought to us in a fancy tequila-looking glass bottle. Weird thing was that there was no ice. Figured that's how the real mexican-fusion peeps do it, so I just drank my room-temp water with my pork-something entree.  Overall, 3-stars because, considering the price,  my mind was not blown.",

This past weekend was actually my second time eating at Border Grill - and I was pumped we were going here because I remember it being fantastic, and it was even more amazing this time around than I remembered!  We had a pretty large group for a bachelorette (12 of us total) and the service was still great; they were very on top of our party.  Most of us opted for the brunch because - how can you not?! We also got the mimosas or mimosas & bloody mary add-on as well. ($15 for bottomless mimosas, $20 for bottomless mimosas, bloody mary's and micheladas). The brunch was around $40.  What I love about this brunch is everything is made fresh - it is all small plates or family-style. Since there were so many of us, they just brought out two family-style plates of all their most popular dishes, and kept 'em coming! (Of course if we had specific requests of dishes we wanted to make sure we got, they brought those as well).   I honestly can't say there was anything I didn't like, but I will say that my favorites from what we got were: - Spicy Chicken Tamale - BBQ Brisket - Breakfast Fries - Pigs in a Croissant  You also have a variety of juices to choose for your mimosas, some being: - Blood Orange (delish) - Peach - Prickly Pear (delish) - Regular OJ & More!  PRO TIP: Since drinks are bottomless, they will give you one in a to-go cup at the end if you request it as well!  I can go on and on but I will say, I love this place, it is a bit expensive for the brunch but well worth the money, especially when going out in Vegas!",

The second time here i had the grilled scallops and shrimp, the scallops were very delicious, but the shrimp was way overgrilled hard and chewy, plus came with a strange sweet potato smear that just did not click with the seafood.

Looks small but filling, how? Sara took care of us and was great and her suggestions were helpful.  All supporting staff were warm and nice.  Overall, great lunch!",

    "text": "Was pleasantly surprised. Decor was a little off, didn't feel like a Latin restaurant when we walked in but the food made up for that. The service was outstanding. I recommend a reservation ahead of time if going on a busy night or if there is a convention going on. We wanted a guaranteed meal time prior to the MJ One show.   Everything here is made fresh, including the chips and the salsa. Not normally a fan of green salsa, we both devoured it! I ordered the brisket taquitos and they were delicious. My wife ordered the chicken poblano enchiladas and loved them. We ordered a side of plantains (seems hard to find those outside of larger Hispanic populated areas) and one of their blanco margaritas. Well, the plantains were gone in minutes and the margarita not long after (ended up ordering another....shhh!).   As a bonus, when I booked the reservation time via another entity's app I had marked it was our anniversary. They sent out a couple of their fresh made chocolate chip cookies and ice cream as a treat. We would definitely come back here again when in Vegas.",

    "text": "My friend and I got to Vegas and instantly decided to start walking around exploring. After hours of walking we were starving and this looked like the best option that was open at the time.  We sadly got there towards the last 45 minutes of the unlimited brunch so it wouldn't have been worth it. The menu looked awesome though! Had I known we could have planned a little better and gone for brunch. There is always next time though!  Once we ordered they brought over some salsa and chips for us to snack in. This was the first good sign. I'm a firm believer that the best mexican restaurants serve free chips and salsa. It should never be something you charge people for. I got the spicy shrimp tacos as my entree. They were extremely flavorful. So flavorful that they were honestly a lot hotter than I expected. Definitely not a complaint but it was a little tough to finish all 3 of my tacos with the heat.  The only complaint I really have is related to the service. It started out great and our waiter was very attentive. Once we started eating it unfortunately went downhill. Our waiter stopped showing up and didn't check in with us. We were clearly done touching our food and no one came over to ask if we were ready for our checks. It would have been fine if my waiter was busy but I saw him and numerous other servers standing around.",

I stopped by here since they had vegan food options and ordered the Cauliflower Annatti \"Paella\", which turned out to be delicious. The sauce was seeped into the veggies creating a perfectly spicy flavor, exactly what I would have wanted from a Mexican restaurant.   What wasn't so good was the water, or more so the dishes they provided to us for the water. There was an odd fishy smell to my water, as well as my family members. We did inform the manager and waiter, who said they would look into the dishwasher and offered to bring us a new bottle of water along with new dishes. I declined it, opting to drink from my bottled water I had previously purchased.   The service was OK. While our waiter was quite pleasant, he neglected to stop by to check on how we were doing until after I was half way though my meal. Lucky for me, I didn't need anything further (other than non smelly water).   Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but it certainly wasn't the best.",

Instead you order food and a small serving is served on small plates. That's ok because you can sample everything on the menu and if you like it you can reorder it as many times as you want! All the food was great! I especially enjoyed the chicken & waffles, bread pudding and bbq brisket sandwich. Couldn't find my parking ticket so I ran back to the restaurant hoping they had found it. I was told they saw it on the floor but the busboy cleaned everything and had thrown it away. Wish they could've put it aside because it costs $30 for a lost ticket...oh well mostly my fault.",

    "text": "A friend recommended going to Border Grill for brunch. She told elaborate stories of a delicious Hispanic, tapas menu that was all you can eat. She also told me about the numerous mimosa flavor options. I knew I had to go after hearing this.   We get to the restaurant at 11am and were greeted very kindly by the hostess. We were seated on their outside patio. We tell the waiter we are doing the brunch option accompanied by the endless mimosas. This included unlimited tapas plates from a menu with about 20 options and for 15$ more, unlimited selection from their 8 different flavored mimosas.   We order our first round of food and then get up to a section where they have food to grab at your leisure including a chia seed parfait, ceviche, and bite size churro bites. There is also a worker that will mix you a fresh salad.   The waiter comes with our first round of food and after each bite I had to take a minute and thank The lord for bringing me to this point in my life. Every bite tasted like such an authentic blend of what the best Hispanic countries have to offer.   Between the three of us we made it through the entire food and mimosa menu. My favorites being the albondigas (Hispanic meatballs) , steak fries, and the AMAZING chicken and waffles. My favorite mimosas were the passion fruit, pomegranate, and blood orange.   My friend got a 15% discount for being a VIP member for being a local. So if you are a local (like me) I would inquire about that.   After all the damage we made our bill was only 50$ per person. The service was excellent, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was relaxing. This establishment will definitely be a new brunch staple for me.",

    "text": "Border brunch was the best end to a week in Vegas. Finally some good vegetarian food with fun flavor and pleasant atmosphere.   Vegas really sucks for vegetarians. It's just the way it is. I was in town for a week for work and stayed at Mandalay Bay. The whole week was a struggle to find edible food.   On my last day I used my remaining Manadalay gift card to go to brunch at the Border Grill. It is $35 for unlimited small plates. Definitely not cheap, but by Vegas standards not bad at all.   We were seated on the back patio which was nice since it was a warm day. The patio is fairly deep though so you don't get sun or views of the pool area.   The waiter explained how things worked and asked what we wanted to start with. Basically, the tapas are all bottomless. You order whatever you want and keep ordering till you can't any more. If you don't like something, don't eat it. They do ask that you order 2 or 3 at a time, I assume so people aren't wasteful.   We had so many small plates while we were here. The great thing is that most are vegetarian so I didn't have to hunt through the fine print on the menu to eat.   The favorites:  - Cauliflower Taquito: amazing! Crispy cauliflower, spicy avocado sauce and jicama slaw. The flavors all came together to be the best thing I had all week. The sauce does have a nice kick to it so be prepared.   - Green Corn Tamales: these were unique from other tamales as they were more cream corn like on the inside, no masa. The flavor was quite good though and very creamy.   - Churro Tots: my favorite of the sweet items. These were chocolate filled and covered in cinnamon sugar. Little bundles of joy. Yum.   We also liked the special waffle of the day which was berry and pear. The waiter recommended this to us when he heard we were vegetarian (this was appreciated). The yogurt parfait was also good in flavor and a nice light plate amongst some the heavier stuff.   I did not like the tomatillo egg benedict. It just had an odd after taste and I did not enjoy the grits or hollandaise.    I would go back here just for the cauliflower taquitos. I'm not sure if they are on the main menu, but go at brunch and just order them again and again. You won't be sorry.",

We decided to sit outside, which I regretted initially since it was so loud out there, but a big party left after too long and it quieted down.  I ordered a pomegranate margarita and my bitch sister-in-law ordered the sangria and we both really liked them. Chips came with three kinds of sauces and I thought the green tomatillo was really good.  I'd studied the online menu and knew I was going to order the chicken poblano enchiladas, which I were able to get without the mushrooms - yay! They were SUPER delicious.  They came with a corn and poblano relish on top, which added a bit of crunch. Wow, they totally lived up to the food I'd seen Mary Sue and Susan cook on TCM.  My husband got the Kobe tacos and didn't particularly care for them. He said they were bland and they also caused him some stomach problems later in the night. Fortunately, he ate the rest of my enchiladas and was really happy with them.  My sister-in-law got some taquito dish that she really enjoyed. My bro-in-law got the chicken enchiladas and loved them too.   Since both couples had just gotten married and it was my husband's birthday, they brought us over 2 free desserts. One was flan and the other was a rich chocolate mousse cake. Both were yummy.",

Super attentive, never had an empty glass and just understood us. She even brought us a plate she thought we would like. Told us to stay as long as we like.

For vegetarians, they have a tasty avocado taco dish that I really enjoyed- it was unique and fulfilling. Our server, Tiffany, was really excellent and made our meal that much better.  She was fast at refilling our chips&salsa and sodas.  At the end, when I mentioned we had to get going for a show, she said she'd bring us our last refills to go- how nice!",

We had a very attentive and fast server who never left us unattended to during the 4+hours we were there. We ate off of the brunch menu and tried 8+ items. Portions were at least double what I would have expected and even with a party of 8, there was enough for us to each try every item.  Steak & Eggs: probably my favorite item. The steak is served on top of some type of black bean and was medium rare with OE eggs on top. Seriously delicious  Shrimp & Grits: Had a lot of spice without being hot. very good  Egg benny: The biscuits these get served with are so good!!!   Also tried the fried green tomatillos, fruit salad, tamales, chilaquiles, chicken and waffles, and smoked salmon sliders.  Overall, Id say brunch is best in a large group so you can try a lot of small bites, but I will definitely be back for the service as well as food.",

    "text": "Came here for a brunch/lunch on our last day in Vegas. With six girls and all varying tastes and preferences, this was a great choice! Mexican food is always a hit, and I particularly enjoy it, so I was really pleased when the birthday girl suggested it! She'd been here on a previous trip to Vegas and recommended it.  We came here at 11:00 because that was when they started serving lunch. They also offer an all-inclusive brunch of small plates, but we were not up for another buffet before the long flight home. We did order a couple of appetizers (guacamole and queso). The guac was really good, and the chips were a huge standout. Freshly fried, they were super fresh and difficult to stop eating. They came with three types of salsa, all of which were good. (None were particularly spicy, but they were all flavorful). The queso was a bit on the runny side for my taste, which also made it difficult to share.  I ordered nachos for my lunch- if you know me, you'd expect this. The nachos suffered from structural issues in their construction. The beans were spread all over the bottom of the plate, with chips on top of them. Toppings were layered on top and baked, so the chips never stood a chance. They were super soggy by the time they made it to the table. The flavor was good, but I mostly picked the chips from the top and left the sodden bottom layer. I added steak to the nachos, and this was a very good choice- the meat was hot, cooked medium, and made a great addition to the dish.  Other girls got tacos, and that's definitely what I would order the next time. Enjoy the crispy chips as an appetizer, but I don't recommend the nachos unless you make a special request to re-structure. Our waitress was nice but pretty absent, and I don't think that type of special request would have been well-received, although I think they would have done it.  We sat on the patio, and it was really nice out there! It's covered and there are fans, so even when it's warm outside, this is a good option to get some fresh air.",

    "text": "Brunch and I have a love hate relationship. I love me an excuse to drink early in the day. I love me the straddled line between breakfast and lunch. I also love me the $35 something price tag for their all you can eat brunch. Add $8 for all you can drink mimosas and I am on my way to a great Sunday afternoon.   They do small plates for all of their brunch offerings. If you are there with a large party, they will prepare items on platters and present it family style.   What we had:  Green corn tamales- It was less a solid tamale and more of a corn pudding style in consistency. The flavors were amazing. It has a little kick, but the corn was so bright and sweet.   Plantain Empandas- The sweetness of the bananas balanced out the saltiness of the cheese and black beans. The green chilies made it a well rounded dish.  Bacon Jalapeno PB&J- Loved this dish. It is a fat kids dream. A breakfast sandwich jammed together with every kids favorite simple sandwich makes me drool a little bit. I won't lie, I make these at home from time to time and this version is everything I want it to be and more.  Peruvian Shrimp and Grits- Uh, yes please. The sauce has a kick and the grits are creamy.  Skirt Steak and Eggs- The meat and eggs are cooked to perfect. The best protein on the menu.  Yucatan Eggs Benedict- Too much biscuit. It is basically a toad in a hole, but overwhelming.  Machaca Chiaquiles- A pile of mush. Odd dish.  Short Rib Hash and Eggs- Too many eggs by this point. How many innocent casualties must be left in our path!  Churro Tots- Not as good as they sound. Odd sweet and sourness to them. Not quite a beignet, not quite a doughnut.  Fig & Blue Cheese Quesadillas- The figs were the best part. Everything else got left behind.  Lobster Pancakes- The biggest disappointment of the day. Little to no lobster sprinkled on top and it was an actual pancake. Weird combination.  By the end, we were all tired and stuffed. The beginning half of the menu is by far the better half. I could have stopped at the Churro Tots and not think twice about the rest.",

I asked for medium but got rare. Not that big of a deal but was hoping to share a few bites with the little kiddo. Too rare for that. The skirt was very tasty. Margaritas were also good but $14 good? Not really. My wife and son had the shrimp and scallop plate. I liked the food but when I asked the family what they thought we all agreed. It was good food but a little pricey for what you actually got. I expect the Mandalay to be expensive but in return I expect to be wowed.",

For a few extra bucks, brunch came with bottomless mimosas.  Now, I ate here earlier this summer, so I don't remember EXACTLY what we had, but all I can remember was how awesome everything tasted and next time I'm at Mandalay Bay on a weekend, we WILL return for brunch.  Food: 5 stars man, it really was delicious.  Keep in mind, this review is for brunch, so I don't know what the rest of their menu is like.  Brunch was tapas style, so servings were small, which allowed us to try so many different dishes.  And each dish had like a lil twist.  There were shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, eggs benedict.  I know, sounds like standard brunch fair right? But it was so good y'all, trust me.  There were like 10 flavors of bottomless mimosa, and I think I got to like 6 before I was like ok it's too early for me to get drunk off champagne.  But all were good except the cucumber one, that one was weird.  Rest were quite tasty.  Service: two thumbs up.  Dangit I can't remember our servers name, but she was knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, attentive, she gave good suggestions, and was all around great lady.  We left her a bomb ass tip.  Atmosphere: We ate on the outdoor patio, overlooking the hotel pool.  The sun was shining in, the air was fresh.  Loved it.    Maybe it was Vegas, maybe it was the drinks, but either way I was quite wooed by the whole experience.",

    "text": "DELICIOUS!  This was my first time at this restaurant and the hype from my friends was certainly legitimate. I've never been to any of the ones in Los Angeles, but supposedly (according to my fellow Yelper, Cori G.) the Vegas one is far superior.   We came here for lunch after driving all day and I had peeked at the menu ahead of time so I was already prepared to order the Baja ceviche. The waiter then informed me that if I wanted, I could order all three or mix two different ones together which was intriguing. I opted for just the one but I think next time I will have to try all three because I was totally blown away by the Baja one. It was bright and acidic with lots of onion and delicious tender chunks of fish and shrimp. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about those tart, tangy flavors with just a little bit of spice from the jalapeno. Yum!  We had also ordered the guacamole and a couple plates of the crispy rajas tacos and both were equally delicious. The guacamole could have been a lot bigger in my opinion but it did the trick, and the tacos were a very unique appetizer. They were simple, crispy potato tacos accentuated by the salty cotija cheese and the sweet roasted corn. All the flavors came together very nicely in this dish, but it's a shame that you only get two for $10!  Of course, the prices here are pretty high but I was expecting that for a restaurant inside the Mandalay Bay. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area that doesn't mind splurging a little on a meal. I am also really interested in trying the Los Angeles chains, and hopefully they are equally as good.",

However the shrimp was small and overcooked. The seafood was wading in a pool of some kind of bland butter wine sauce. I thought I ordered an entree but I was served something more along the line of soup. The greens of some sort that were also in the dish were too bitter for my taste. There was some rice I dig out of the bottom of the dish, but nearly enough. The service was extremely slow after the meal. The server, while attentive in the beginning, was no where to be found after we said we didn't want the dessert menu. Mind you she only had one other table in our section and out still took more than 20 minutes to get the check signed and get out of there after declining the dessert menu.",

That's just fabulous. The chips and salsa were very good and Rachael offered us the habanero salsa if we wanted a really spicy salsa, which I did asked for. It wasn't that spicy, but it was good none-the-less.   As an appetizer, my girlfriend and I got cerviche. It was just light and satisfying. I had ordered the torta which was essentially a burger and it was tasty. My girlfriend order 3 tacos with different meat and each of them was packed with flavor.  I would definitely come back here for Mexican food if I was in Vegas.",

Again all the dishes were all the dishes were made to order, we at first ordered a few to start and while we were eating the attentive serving staff asked us what we would like next and the that order was placed and came out fresh.

We planned a brunch at the Border Grill which was delicious. Getting to the restaurant was a little confusing as I have a hard time making my way around casinos and it was located more in the convention and shark reef area. We arrived for our reservation and requested patio seating, it was nice to look outside but it was more enclosed than I would have preferred! Our server, such a nice girl I wish I remembered her name, explained the menu and got us started right away on our $10 bottomless mimosas which she suggested we try one of each. She was so nice and attentive always making sure our glasses were full, our orders were taken, and not rushing us one bit. Brunch is $34.99 all-you-can-eat with a menu of tasty items you can pick one of each of or re-ordering your favorites. We tried just about every item and every mimosa and were not disappointed.",

You will be glad you did. First. Margaritas!  Excellent and feature a nice choice of tequila to choose from. And.   For a Mandalay Bay venue.  Pretty reasonable. My entree was pulled pork served in a banana leaf with fresh tortillas on the side. Awesome.  Really different.  It was a server recommendation and was a win win meal. Killer guacamole too! There was a big fight that night in the resort and they were busy but they were staffed for it and service was spot on.  A great meal  a price point that is a bargain.  Go here. You will love it!!",

The dish was preceded with homemade corn chips and 3 salsas. There was a tomtailo, red chile, and a smoked chipolte. All 3 were good. The chips were a little greasy but were still good. They were made from thick homemade tortillas and were crispy.   The enchilada dish arrived promptly, and the presentation was very well executed. The plate had a base of the chipotle sauce with streaks of cream streaked through the sauce. The three chicken enchiladas were topped with a corn salas which consisted of asparagus that had been thinly sliced and cooked just till tender. There were also slices of Ancho chiles, corn and onion in the salad. This was topped with the string cheese.  The Chicken Enchilada's were made of homemade corn tortillas, rolled around the chicken and cheese mixture. This dish might have been the best enchilada dish I've every had, except for at Orlando's in Taos, New Mexico. The thick tortilla and the chicken mixture had just the right texture and flavor.   The restaurant advertises themselves as Real Mexican, it is not the standard Tex-Mex fair. The restaurant was created by Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger. They had a Food Network show called The Two Hot Tamales when the network was still new. I still have some of their recipes. I would give this restaurant a must visit while in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "About four years ago, I had the best meal of my life at Border Grill. Unfortunately, I wasn't a proud member of yelp at the time so it went largely unnoticed.  Back then, I ordered an adobada pork chop that came with mashed potatoes and greens. The thick cut pork chop was smothered in an ancho chile sauce that makes me smile just thinking about it.  Unfortunately, my wife and I didn't make it back until this past Saturday night. Was it a special occasion? No, not really.  However, thanks to our older daughter, we were able to get out for a date night- our second in almost 3 years. So, yeah I guess it was a special occasion -for us anyway.    So off we went hoping to recapture that memory of what we long considered to be one the best meals we have ever had the privilege of eating.  Before I could sit down or even look at a menu, I yelled out adobada pork chop please!  Our waiter Rob apologized and said that dish was no longer available on the regular menu.  What? What do you mean? There must be some mistake!  Rob told us that every now and then the dish is offered as a special-just not Saturday night.  Now what?  Instead of walking out kicking and screaming, we decided to give the new menu a shot. I settled on the tecate carnitas plate, and my wife chose the Kobe beef sopes. My dish was presented well with the tender pork in the center of the plate surrounded by fantastic guacamole, salsa, onions, cilantro, and a crunchy slaw. Since I ordered both flour and corn tortillas, I prepared my own tacos and ate till my shoes started feeling tight. The Kobe beef sopes were great! The portion was small (3 little sopes about the size of mini muffins), but the flavor more than made up for it. The cilantro mint slaw on top was heavenly.   As far as the service is concerned, we couldn't have been more satisfied. Rob was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. He provided us with a 10% discount since we signed up for their rewards card a number of years ago. I am glad he asked, since I forgot we did that. Border Grill also treated us to a free dessert since my wife and I were on a date for the first time in years. Well played Border Grill-well played!   Call it what you want--- tex-mex, Mexican food, or fresh-mex.  Bottom line, this place offers quality food with complex flavors that will make you want to take your wife/husband out for more dates.    Oh yeah, can someone let me know when the pork chop makes it back on the menu?",

    "text": "The dinner is very good, don't get me wrong, but it's right on the edge of \"I think I'm paying too much for this\". The brunch, though? Oh lordy lordy, the brunch...I will attempt to describe it in my mere mortal words.   Bottomless mimosas for $5. I could probably end the review right there.  Endless small plates for $30. The plates are so amazingly delicious. My mortal words fail me! And don't forget to ask for the Chef's Special plate. He's always got something new you can try that isn't on the menu, and you can follow him on Twitter to find out what it is or just ask for it when you get there. I haven't had a brunch plate yet that I'm not a fan of.   Border Grill also takes pride in having their ingredients be fresh and as locally-sourced as possible. The only thing I can fault them on is that the beef isn't grass-fed, and for the price it definitely could be but I'm not going to complain too much.   The chips and salsa are optional for brunch, if you tell them you're there for it they won't bring it out unless you ask for it specifically. The habanero salsa is definitely spicy, but has a GREAT flavor. I encourage you to mix and match the four salsas as well. They all go very well with each other and you can't go wrong with any combination.   The guacamole is also stellar, although the portion is a bit small. It seems to me that the plate is a small pile of guac and a majority of veggies dressing up the plate. Well, maybe it's the unlimited chips that make it seem small, or the fact that everybody at the table is in a race to eat as much of it as they can before it's all gone.  I go here least once a month for brunch and try to make it every chance I get. Friends that have come with me to dinner here and were only okay with the place have also jumped on board with the brunch and make a semi-regular pilgrimage as well. Seriously. Go here for brunch right now. Weekends, 11:00-15:00. Do it.",

The prices at the Las Vegas location are really high, but understand because of being inside the hotel. That said, the food was awful. I ordered the Ensenada fish tacos and they were tasteless. Tortillas were cold. The rice was cold. And it took over 30 min to get served. My opinion, not worth the price.",

    "text": "It was a Christmas brunch in the making.  The guest list was set.  The location was made and it so happened to be the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.  Thank goodness this brunch was set right after the Packers Game, because I did NOT want to miss it.  So I've been hearing a lot of great stuff about this place from many friends, Yelpers or not.  It's a Sunday Brunch for $29.99.  This brunch menu includes and array of tapas style small plates, ALL YOU CAN EAT!  We had a party of 8 and Border Grill was super cool to transform the small plates into a family style platter to accommodate our party.  The best part:  pay an extra $5 and you have a bottomless mimosa special.  STEAL!!!  For the mimosa, I stuck to the same flavor which was amazing: the pomegranate mimosa.  They literally have a selection to choose from.  It's awesome!!  For the brunch portion, here's what I got and here's what I thought:  Short Rib Hash and Eggs - Beer braised Short Ribs hashed with caramelized onions and yams with a sunny side up egg.  This dish was to die for!!  The short rib was rich in flavor from the Negro Modelo.  The yams made the dish a little sweet, but in an AH-MAZE-ING way.  Crack the egg and the yolk adds a thick depth of flavor to the dish.  I LOVED IT SOOOOO MUCH!!  Peruvian Shrimp and Grits - Chile marinated shrimp, poblano chiles and Parmesan grits.  The shrimp was a little spicy but super flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I even grossed my table out with the tail.  I'm a proud Filipino who happens to love eating the crunchy tails of the shrimp.  Don't judge me! LOL.  The grits were good, but certainly an acquired taste.    Yucatan Egg Benedict - Manchego cheese biscuit, roasted pork, poached egg, hollandaise sauce served with pickled onions.  Not the favorite, that's for sure.  I don't know if it was dense and soggy biscuit, or the poached egg or the texture of the pickled onions.  Something just didn't add up.    Crispy Potato Rajas Taco - YUMMY!!  Potatoes and chiles, Mexican cheeses, guacamole, corn relish and chipotle aoili.  This was a GREAT dish!  My mouth is still salivating over this taco.  Who would have thought?!  A potato taco!  Churro Tots - dulce de leche infused churros, cinnamon sugar, caramel and pear dipping sauce with whipped cream.  This was the perfect end to our very huge brunch!  The churros were little bite sized goodness and the dipping sauces were the perfect touch!!  All in all, we had a great time.  We were sat on the outside deck.  Although in the winter, the warmers made it feel comfortable.  The decor was a little eclectic but it worked.  I definitely think you should try this brunch if you have not.  It's a little pricey, but perfect for the strip and great for a Holiday like Christmas!!  I'm definitely going to push for making this an annual event :)",

Lemonade was really over sweet and wasn't very good.  Everything was really salty (coming from someone who likes salt)  The fish tacos were dry and flavorless and what didn't taste that great.  The corn tortillas were also flavorless.  The shortrib enchiladas were just ok, but nothing to write home about for almost $30.  The guac was $9.50 and was about 1/4 cup of over salty guac that was also nothing special.  The chips were pretty good.  I would have given it 3 stars but the price of the food for the quality of the food made me take it down a notch.  It's not right to charge such high prices for   However the waitstaff was on point and the hostess was really sweet.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for the price you can choose so many other great places.",

    "text": "We went for brunch on a Sunday morning after reading about Border Grill in Vegas/Rated magazine.  For $24.99 you get an all-you-can-eat brunch - but this isn't your usual Vegas buffet - everything is made to order and served tapas style.    We started with the fresh fruit plate and guava empanada.  The guava empanada was heavenly...the filling was almost like a guava cream cheese.  Next, we tried the chilaquiles and the green corn tamale.  The green corn tamale is sweet and delicious with just a little sour cream.  We followed this with the Yucatan eggs benedict - not as delicious as all of my fellow Yelpers let on - and the steak and eggs.  My husband was a huge fan of the steak and eggs...I think he only shared one bite.  The breakfast enchilada and the chorizo and egg taco were last.  I am not a huge chorizo fan so I did not enjoy the taco, but the breakfast enchilada was amazing.  The chicken was so flavorful and tender and I loved the cotija cheese.  For dessert, we ordered the coconut french toast, which was a perfect ending to a fabulous meal...just the right amount of sweet.    Our server was tremendous - very sweet and always there with a refill for my all-you-can-drink mimosas (only $5!).  The passionfruit one is incredible - I may have overindulged!

However, you are not allowed to certain dishes even if the total bill would be less than the $120.  You can order those dishes with extra charge.  There is a mandatory $20 tip added, too.

I immediately scarfed the whole thing down which kind of made me a little sick later, but that was my fault. Well worth it.

Worst economic recession in over 50 years and we've started closing early?  So we go the next week. Get some Filet with lobster sauced enchiladas, and I mean, the food was so salty that if my dad were to eat it he'd go into Heart Failure. Worse than that our appetizer had some little potato food thing the size of a quarter, and two shrimp. Not worth it!   Our server was nice and the salsa for the chips and dip is pretty good, but for a mexicanesque restaurant you need better than good salsa and appetizers that fill an infant to get on my good graces.   Also hostess staff and all staff have to realize that you don't close until customers stop coming.",

For the entrees we ordered the Skirt Steak as well as the Yucatan Pork. The Skirt Steak was cooked prefect to how we ordered it (Medium Rare) and was deliciously seasoned with fresh homemade tortilla and accompaniments. The Yucatan Pork was delicious; a balance of sweet and spicy (although it really wasn't that sweet, more so just used cinnamon as a spice in the cooking process). It comes with three small homemade corn tortillas, accompaniments, as well as some plantains which were a little dessert added in my opinion.  Definitely recommend this place if you are in L.A. or VEGAS!",

I ran a train on that bitch.) 2) Plaintain empanadas were good.  Not the best thing I've ever eaten, but I definitely would get them again. 3) Caesar salad with skirt steak:  excellent, excellent steak.  Cooked to perfection.  Salad could have used a bit more dressing but it was good, that nice Mexican spicier Caesar dressing. 4) Beef taquitos.... yeah, that was the shit squared.  The best taquitos we have ever eaten.  Period.  Phenomenal stuff.  Black beans served with were also good.  Green rice not so much.  But I don't like green rice anyway, so no harm done. 5) Friend's pork... nice cinnamon rub, excellent flavor.  We dug it highly.  Only real downside was the 50-cent water per person slammed on the table as soon as we sat down, and seeing the bit on the menu at the bottom in small print about being able to refuse it about 5 minutes later after we already drank.  Meh.    But for food?  We are very glad we finally got to try it.  Thanks, Top Chef Masters, for the heads up.",

I ordered tacos because HELLO we are at a Mexican place, but the short ribs were DIVINE! I can't wait to return and order a plate for myself. The tacos were very good, but nothing in comparison.

The weather was mid-80s so the 7:30 pm ceremony and reception were outside...beautiful, perfect and plenty of room!  We supplied the decorations the morning of the wedding, and Gracious and the staff decorated for us. Talk about awesome ~ It allowed us more sun time at the pool with our friends and family!   Autumn and the crew were attentive and fun. The food was delicious. We selected a variety of passed appetizers. It was a great way to sample a bunch of different bites while mingling. Dessert note: The tres leches cake is a must ~ so amazing!  The whole event was easy and relaxing. We highly recommend Border Grill for someone looking for a classy yet laid-back wedding and reception venue.",

    "text": "It was a Saturday night but still....  Found the food flavorful and creative in the favors and combinations but the plating gave us the impression we were at a budget banquet event.   Our \" Special guacamole with bacon\" was plopped on the plate in which it was served like it came out of a serving spoon from a vat....$11.00 please!  My roasted pork was served on a banana leaf for decoration but again...plopped on the leaf with little care or accompaniments. Tortillas were good but cost extra with the pork I ordered.   You may like the taste of what's served here but the price and lack of care in plating for the prices charged didn't add up to good value to me.  Our server's section on the patio was over-seated and for a $150 dinner for two we expected a better commitment to service staffing. We saw no management cruise the patio for oversight. A swamped server that got little support. You know the picture.   Flavorful food but the overall dining experience left us feeling like tourist who got what they deserved for going here on a Saturday night.   Plop!",

    "text": "The sun still rises in the east.  Birds do fly south for the winter.  And Border Grill Mandalay Bay, after 15 years, remains a solid, \"Mexican\" dining experience.  Note:  This visit was prompted after less than stellar visit to Border Grill's newest location at Caesars Forum Shops.  By the numbers:  17 dishes, 4 drinks, 3 hours, 2 overly stuffed friends, 1 great meal.  It's called \"Small Plates\".  For $45pp it include EVERYTHING on the menu (or in our case, server selected and coursed dishes).  It is an all encompassing gastronomic view of the restaurant well worth the thousands of calories.  BURP!  The result, unexpected standouts.  The green corn tamales, excellent.  Filled with umber sweet corn and balanced with a simple but acidic salsa.  The peppery watercress, crisp almost apple like jicama and sweet orange salad topped with bacon wrapped, bleu cheese stuffed dates and a creamy coriander vinaigrette, another win.  Beautiful balance of flavors and textures.    Very well made ceviches The Baja (shrimp, fish, lime, tomato, and jalapeno aioli) a True standout.  The sweetness of the shrimp is accentuated by the fresh, acidic tartness of the lime.  The tomato provides a perfect bridge between the flavors.  Slight spiciness adding complexity.  For mains, if there's mole, it's a winner.  Great Oaxacan strip steak.  Tender and juicy.  It's beefy flavor heightened by he earthiness of the slightly spicy mole.  The pork en mole, porky, earthy goodness.  The addition of pickled veg brightens the palate after every bite.  Very weak selections of wine and beer.  Well designed selection of hand crafted, margaritas and mojitos.  Be very careful with the blood orange margarita.  Jalapeno in the drink and rimmed with spicy mole; it packs a very spicy punch.  Excellent, friendly service.    Per the restaurant, the menu is being updated in the coming weeks so act fast for a last try of the favorites.  Redemption.",

Let's place this review amongst the Las Vegas environment - things are just more expensive. If you want to come to Las Vegas to eat affordably, I would suggest avoiding this place. It's run by two world class chefs. The add for the mimosas is well worth it, considering places on the strip offer a similar add on for $15. The day I went, they had 9 different flavours (one of which was watermelon rosemary, another was prickly pear, pretty unique).  Our server was Luis, and he was wonderful. I can't give him anymore credit. He was quick to describe the dishes and make suggestions. He kept bringing us new flavours of mimosas without us even asking.  We tried about 90% of the menu items, at least once. The food was incredibly fresh and flavourable. It had a great authenticity to the flavours. You could tell the chefs really care about this cuisine. When we sat down, we received a starter of empanandas to start as our server said it'll be a little bit before we received our first round, which was not only thoughtful but they were tasty as heck!  We sat inside but they also had a patio.",

    "text": "This review is for Sunday brunch. Two stars is due to the fact that it was very expensive for what we got and, by that, I mean the poor taste of the food and severely underwhelming mimosas. The price per person is $34.99 for bottomless small plates and $10 for bottomless mimosas. The small plates, where we tried almost all of them except for two, were significantly underwhelming or not very good. The only dish that was outstanding was the corn tamales. Everything else, from the shrimp and grits to the steak and eggs to the chile rellenos to the churros to the tres leches French toast to the taquitos and more were just blah. The lettuce wraps containing corn with cheese and a chipotle sauce were absolutely terrible. The mimosas were just bland... The blood orange mimosa was OK. I then ordered the peach mimosa which did not change the taste that much from the blood orange one and my friend ordered the prickly Pear mimosa which was a spectacular beautiful fuchsia pink and had a wonderful medicine taste to go along with it. It just was not good. We still felt hungry at the end because we only had a little bit of each plate since not very good and paid a fortune. This is a restaurant that likely does well because of its location, in a very busy hotel with a lot of tourists. I would not recommend it at all as a local because it was very disappointing and there are plenty of way better places for brunch.  The guest that was with me, who is from Mexico, was very disappointed and explained that all of the Mexican dishes were way below the part that is expected of even a really good Mexican dish. The only good thing was that we had a very nice waiter but otherwise, the ambience of the restaurant is just OK. We will not be returning.",

However, this year I knew something was different just by the looks of the crowd.  Usually it's packed and not easy to get a reservation.  Not this year.  The bar still had seats most days and there wasn't much of a wait for dinner.  Dinner was below mediocre.  I ordered the Roasted chicken.  From the time the wait brought my plate I could see the chicken was more like \"Fried\".  So I asked him how was this prepared cause it seems so over cooked.  He said it should be slightly crispy and moist inside.  Well that was not the case here.  The chicken was so over cooked I didn't even finish it.  The server never came back to ask if I wanted something else, nor did he apologize that I didn't perhaps enjoy it.  Others ordered skirt steak and chicken enchiladas.  We all agreed this wasn't the same food we have had in previous years.  Fried plantain's and Chips/salsa were about the best thing we ate.",

    "text": "*Thumbs up* Aside from the Border Grill truck, this was my first time trying the restaurant. I've passed by the LA location numerous times, but never actually dined. After hearing about the AYCE brunch from everyone else, it was time to give it a try.  My wife and I tried 15 dishes total from the brunch menu, and I thought all of the dishes were well executed. The dishes with the protein like carnitas, brisket, and steak were all tender and nicely cooked. The eggs were runny. The churro tots and the bread pudding was the perfect ending to the brunch -- even if it meant stretching out my stretchy pants even further.  *Thumbs down* After a while, the dishes started to taste the same... mainly because I ate so much. Most use the same ingredients over and over -- pico del gallo, corn tortillas, sunny side egg, omelet, etc -- just repurposed for a different dish.   About $80 something for 2 people, including tax and tip, which is pricey... but if you eat 10+ dishes, I think it's worth the price. If the price came with endless mimosas, of course then it would be really worth it.",

Flavor was terrible, presentation worse, cold pork cheeks and only very few pieces thrown inside the bread, never found one single caramelizad onion, scarcely some pickles jalapenos and wilted cilantro radish salad.  On top of everything an unfriendly hostess.  Will not recommend this place at all.  It is not modern and it is not Mexican food.",

We came here last night because we wanted a great dinner, what we got was anything but that.  The ribeye's which they charge $38 for was not even worth $10.  The last time we were here a medium rare ribeye was very juicy and tender, last night it was dry, hard and a very bad cut of meat.    My wife's was so bad she sent it back.  The manager came over and apologized saying she did not know if maybe it was the vendor did not have exactly what they ordered this time or what happened.  She did apologize and took the ribeye off our bill and told my wife she would also comp dessert or another drink for here.  She said she did not want the dessert but would have another drink.  Guess what $12 charge for the drink, no comp???  A big deal, NO not really, just another sign of a great place going down hill.  I am not sure what happened to the quality of the meat they use, but the ribeye I had was nothing like the last time.  Also, when someone tells you they will do something, they should make sure it happens.    Our server was new only been there a few months, but the entire feel of attention to detail and service was so different then the last visit we had.  It is sad to say this place will now be off our list of good places to visit.    I still encourage you to give this place a shot, just know in advance everything is very spicy even though the waiter will tell you \"NO, its not spicy at all\".  This is not a bad thing just something to be aware of as not everyone likes spicy foods.",

I will say that they do not have many options that they can make vegetarian, in terms of altering their menu;  however, I liked the portobello mushroom dish I ordered, even though I am not a huge portobello mushroom fan.  Drinks were really yummy, so that was a plus.   We all had food coma afterward, which was not good for trying to go out after, but a great meal is always good.  Service was okay but our water glasses were not filled very much and once the food was ordered, they didn't come by much to check on us.  Overall, check it out if you eat meat/fish.  For vegetarians, there are not too many options to check out the menu first before going.",

The good: - For $35, you can try anything from huevos rancheros to steak and eggs to breakfast fries (similar to poutine but better!). - For an additional $10 - I repeat $10 - you can also get bottomless mimosas.  You seriously can't beat this deal, as one mimosa can typically run you anywhere from $5-8 each.  There are various seasonal juices (at least 9) and all were fresh. - Service was great, and our waitress even let us order about 30 minutes after brunch ended.  Score. - Atmosphere was lax and inviting.  The outdoor patio also overlooks the pool area and lazy river.  Definitely recommend.  Cannot wait to go back (hopefully each time I'm in Vegas!).",

    "text": "I can't give Border Grill a better than 3 star review because it is the little things that matter just as much as the big things.  We went on a LivingSocial deal that for $59 for two we got guacamole, an appetizer to share, 2 $29 entrees, a dessert and 2 drinks.  Good deal, right?    The service was good and attentive, in fact very good.  The margaritas that came with the meal were small and we finished them quickly.  Not bad but nothing special.  The chips and salsa were tasty but nothing much beyond what is found in every Mexican restaurant in town.  We had the ahi tuna appetizer and while there were spicy tastes, the tuna itself seemed to get lost and had no recognizable taste.  Our entrees were good sized, I had the tecate carnitas and she had the sauteed scallops and shrimp.  Both were good and certainly a cut above your average Mexican place.  The flour tortilla that came with my dish was really tasty.  The carnitas were not as tasty and seemed a little bland.  I complained when we first sat down that it was cold.  Nothing changed.  Towards the end of our meal a manager came by to inquire about our satisfaction and I mentioned that sitting and being cold took away from my enjoyment of the meal.  He did apologize with some story of doing some remodeling, that the hotel controls the heat and that the room they put us in was more of an overflow room with lots of glass and doors.  Regardless, I was cold and a place that has no control of the temp should renegotiate their lease.  I feel that Border Grill is responsible for my comfort not Mandalay Bay Hotel.  Why put people in this room when you know it is cold.  That night it dropped into the 30's.  I would have trouble hearing any excuse other than offering to move our table which was never offered.  If I would have paid full price I would have left unhappier.  While nice it was not superior and while the servers all did a great job there were enough little things that were only palatable because of the deal.",

My family doesn't really eat fish, but they loved the fish tacos. Embarrassingly enough, we even went back the next night after we couldn't stop talking about how great everything was (especially their chips). The atmosphere was great, and the menu selection looked good as well. The only thing that could have been improved was when the server knocked a glass of water on me and soaked my dress. Accidents happen, and it wasn't a huge deal-I did have to go back to my room and change, but no apology was even given.  I would recommend this restaurant, and wish a location was in my home-town.",

We decide to order the guacamole which was bland and lacked any flavor besides a strong onion flavor (some spice, salt, and lime was needed).  Unfortunately the meal was far from redeeming.  I ordered the beef quesadilla.  The outershell was soaked in oil and unedible and it was loaded with so much cheese that it overpowered the beef so I ended up picking the quesadilla to push everything to the side except for the beef, which was cooked well but could have been seasoned better.  It had an expansive menu which was great for people who have a wide range of preferences in food, however that was unfortunately the only good thing I experienced at Border Grill.",

    "text": "The best brunch I have ever had! On Saturdays and Sundays they have a tapas and mimosa brunch, which for ~$40 is a great deal.  We made a reservation, and I would advise you do the same, so that you can set on the patio close to the pool. We were there in December, but with the heaters and the sun, it was perfect.  The tapas included 26 or 27 small plates that you can order and sample. I dined with 2 companions and, between the 3 of us, we were able to sample most of the offerings. The highlights for me were the Negro Modelo-braised hash (super tender meat and a perfectly soft fried egg), the shrimp and grits (so creamy with the perfect amount of spice),  the tamales (super creamy), and for \"dessert' the churro tots (just like churros, but in the form a donut hole, accompanied by berry puree and caramel). Actually, there were no bad small plates, each one flavorful and well presented.  The mimosas were also great (the brunch is $34, and you can add the mimosas for $8) and they have various flavors, including basil apple, grapefruit ginger, cucumber lemon, passion fruit, pomegranate, peach, and orange. I tried most of them, but the cucumber was the most refreshing, with the grapefruit and the pomegranate coming in close seconds.  Our service was amazing...we were sat immediatly (thanks to a reservation) at a table along the edge of the patio, so we could see out and enjoy he sun, Our server was also amazing, letting us absorb the menu and never rushing us (even though we stayed for almost 3 hours). He was very attentive, as were the other members of the team including the manager who came by to check on us and the guys bringing us our food and drinks...they were at our table quite a bit:).  This was a relaxing and amazing experience, I highly recommend it.  If you are not in to all you can eat things, the food that the people seated around us ordered looked great, with large portions and attractive plating.",

I felt that it was a little pricey for what you get, but the food was good. I love that they offer a locals discount and you can get <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificates, so there are discounts available.   One of my favorite meals is brunch and I was pleased to learn that they offered an all you can eat small plate brunch. So I immediately set up a brunch date with my girls and it has been our go-to brunch restaurant ever since. The small plates are super awesome, again it is a little pricey, but it is all you can eat! I love that they start the table with fruit and guava empanadas. The empanadas are flakey and absolutely addicting, I seriously dare you to only eat one. Some of my favorite dishes are the skirt steak and eggs, short rib hash and eggs, breakfast fries (super yum), chilaquiles, and I always order at least two potato tacos. There are a few misses for me as well, the plantain empanadas just taste burnt and the churro tots are way too dense.   Since discovering the delicious brunch, I have been here at least four times. The last time we were seated downstairs and it is by far the best place to sit when it is too hot to sit on the patio. It's all glass so you can still see the pool outside and you get plenty of sunshine. If you want to have a fun, delicious, and laid back weekend brunch you absolutely must check out Border Grill.",

My shredded pork was cold and for what we paid it was quite disappointing.  We went on Monday so I'm thinking that is the reason but I shouldn't have to make an excuse for Vegas caliber restaurant, right...  Hope you all get better service and food but I'm have no desire to return.",

You can also add endless mimosas (I highly recommend)  they offer those in several flavors.  Now, for the food.  The best I've had.  There were six of us and they brought ours family style.  We must have ordered 8 to 10 different dishes and not one disappointed!!  The service was outstanding!!  Never once did we have an empty glass or plate.  Will definitely come back and recommend to everyone!!!",

    "text": "My favorite entree here is the grilled skirt steak ($27).  The steak is so flavorful, mine was cooked perfectly.  The combination of flavors with the corn relish and black beans in that soft, handmade tortilla is just amazing...makes my mouth water just thinking about it :)  It was even better with some of the guacamole that we ordered as a starter.  My husband had the chicken mole, which he said was delicious as well.  Our server was wonderful, she recommended the black cherry mojito and the sparkling white peach lemonade, both of which were amazing!  They even brought us a complimentary dessert for my husband's birthday...the pineapple upside down cake served warm with pineapple ice cream...we devoured this dessert!    The only misses that I've had here were during a lunch visit: the Yucatan Pork (mainly because I didn't like the orange flavor in the pork, too sweet for me), and the green corn tamales (also because it was sweeter than I expected).  We used a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate, which made our dinner fairly reasonable for the strip.  I can't wait to come back for their weekend brunch!",

The Serrano Ham waffle and tres leche French toast were great. Sweet but not too sweet. The best part of our most recent visit was our waiter Luis. He was super attentive and friendly. When one round of our food was taking a little longer he made sure to stop by and let us know and refill our drinks. Can't say enough about him. Would highly recommend any meal at Border Grill.",

    "text": "We had a lovely beer-soaked lunch on the covered patio here last weekend. The chile relleno burger called to me, but I couldn't rightly order a burger at a Mexican place like this. So, I opted for the shrimp tacos and did not regret it. The shrimp were plump, the tacos spicy and the sides of beans and rice were light and fresh. My husband had the chilaquiles, which were amazingly good. We had to physically restrain ourselves around the chips and salsa, and the delightfully oniony guacamole.    My only complaint (and the reason for a star loss) is that they charge 50 cents a person for their water. But I didn't learn that from the waiter. He just showed up and started pouring. Nope, the note about the extra charge was buried in tiny print on the menu. I know it's just 50 cents, but a) that adds up over time and b) it's just bad form to sneak stuff like that on people. It would have been nice if the waiter had stated the charge up front and let us decide whether that was okay.",

We found out that the brunch menu is actually sort of tapas style- it was around 25 bucks per person but you could get unlimited of any of the brunch items. This was pretty fun because we got to try smaller portions of more plates.  I tried the Huevo Ranchero, Green Corn Tamale, Potato Rajas Taco, Coconut French Toast, and Cinnamon Apple Pancakes. They sound sort of strange to combine those items in the same meal, but it worked out fine.  I liked the Huevo Ranchero and the Coconut French Toast the best (even though the french toast tasted more like the sauteed bananas than coconut). The Green Corn Tamale was pretty cool - it is very sweet.  Overall it was fun trying everything- I wasn't blown away by the tastes of these vegetarian dishes...but they were pretty good (though i'll pass on the apple pancakes if i go again). It was a fun little experience and nice to try something other than a buffet in Vegas",

We just went back to Las Vegas and we had to have dinner at the Border Grill because we didn't have a chance to appreciate the food with all of the post-wedding excitement.    The service was superb!  From our greeting, to our waitress, to the gentleman that took our plates, poured our water, and brought us tortilla chips.  Friendly, warm and genuine people.  The food was perfect.  I ordered the fish tacos and my wife ordered the Kobe tacos.  I have never had such fresh and well-seasoned fish tacos anywhere and my wife's Kobe tacos were incredibly tasty.  I also ordered a Blood Orange Margarita and I wish that I could have another...just sitting here...man was that good.  The atmosphere was relaxing and soothing, the staff was attentive but not overbearing, it was just a perfect experience and the highlight of our Las Vegas dining experience.  I would highly recommend the Border Grill to anyone that is a fan of refined Mexican cuisine.  You are in for a surprise.",

One of the managers, Melanie, also  came to our table.  During our visit, she  said she loves her job and it definitely showed.    Chef Juan came out to chat with us numerous times during the  8 courses.  We loved them all...from the Smoked Brisket Taquitos  with layers of flavors and the plantain empanadas that were crispy on the edges and sweet inside...to the Surf & Turf with Kobe beef.  What a special treat!!!  We also appreciated the beautiful presentation of the Steelhead salmon placed atop sauteed greens on one side and the mashed potatoes with whimsical tortilla strips on the other.  (The tortilla chips looked like candles in the mashed potatoes.)  For dessert, the carrot cake with passionfruit puree was scrumptious but we just had to take that home so as to not explode right there in the restaurant.   My husband is a teaching chef and I am often his sous chef.  As such, we know our foods.  The Tasting Menu at Border Grill is a flavorful gourmet experience.  Come hungry because although the servings are small, you will be stuffed at the end.    Bon Appetit!",

    "text": "I dined here for their famous all you can eat brunch with 7 friends for a fun business meeting. I have heard of it and always wanted to try it!   Food pros: The brunch has a great variety of different dishes and are considered small plates. With that said they are definitely generous \"small\" portions. The price is right at $35 and to top it off you can add endless mimosas for $8. It was lots of fun ordering and tasting different dishes. My favorites were the skirt steak, shrimp and grits, frittata tart, and the waffle with pork belly. Some things I tried weren't my favorite, but that is just my personal taste. The lobster pancakes had an odd flavor and needed more lobster! That's what makes it so fun and enjoyable, there is something for everybody! Everything came out mostly hot, a couple things could have been warmer. Our server was great and accommodating especially dealing with 8 women. There are 10, that's right, 10 different flavors of mimosas! Each equally delicious and refreshing.   Food cons: A few dishes weren't as hot as I would have preferred. I am sure the kitchen was crazy though as it was a busy Sunday morning. A few dishes weren't for me, but most were amazingly delicious and filled with flavor. I would suggest having a selection of the brunch menu available for ala carte or available as a full entree.   Service: The staff was pleasant and helpful. Our server was very busy but still attentive to our table. He was lots of fun and accommodating.   I would definitely go back again! Maybe next time for lunch or dinner. I would be more likely to return for brunch if they offered their brunch items ala carte or available as a full entree. Overall it was a tasty and fun dining experience.",

The food finally arrived and it was cold. Cold eggs, cold eggs Benedict. It was gross. I asked for the manager but none arrived. Waited longer and asked again a little meaner this time. A manager arrived but offered no explanation. She offered to have items remade but, let's face it, once you eat a cold runny egg you're kinda done. She did bring back a small plate but it wasn't made right. She did pay for our mimosas-big deal. It was the last meal w my family before the left for the airport.

    "text": "OMG love this place. The food was awesome and so was our waiter Jeff. Took a cab from the Cosmo ($11.00) to Mandalay bay to eat here. It lived up to to the hype. I had the skirt steak. It was cooked perfectly. It came with a roasted corn and refried beans,also yummy. My partner had the short rib enchiladas and was very happy. The guacamole was very good also. We both had a jalapeno margarita that was delicious. It was so good we almost went back the next night for dinner again. It's a must try when in Vegas. Next time  in Vegas I may have to book my stay at Mandalay bay just to be close to border grill!",

    "text": "We came here on recommendation from a friend who finds it hard to find decent Mexican food in Vegas.   The good? They have pretty good service, decent guacamole, and my friend's scallops were great, just doused in sauce. Oh, and she ordered a blood orange margarita that was delicious!  The rest of our meal? Salsas are quite bland, the steak nachos were covered in some orange sauce that made my stomach do somersaults almost immediately...Strangely enough, the carne asada on our nachos was better then the carne asada plate we ordered. Also, I specifically asked what veggies came with the meal because they said we could substitute. The waitress told me squash and zucchini. Perfect! My friend and I both ordered the veggies. When our meals were served, she got the veggies and the ones on my plate were tomatoes and cucumber--more like a tiny Greek salad. I was highly annoyed. For dessert, I just ordered my toddler berries with whipped cream. The berries came in a bowl of a side dish--maybe a dozen total. The whipped cream was a side of creme fraiche. For a toddler. Really? She's two. \"Me no like it\" is what kept coming out of her mouth.   Lastly, the pricing. I paid $138 for two appetizers, two main courses, a tiny bowl of fruit, one alcoholic drink and two sodas--and only ate about 65% of the meal. Huge disappointment. What I'm more confused about is the pricing of the items. I understand it's Vegas and you pay for location. Seriously. I get it. But since when do scallops and shrimp have the same price as a quesadilla or enchiladas?? I'll admit, the quesadilla looked appetizing, but my soul wouldn't let me order it. Quesadillas are what we eat when we need to throw something together quick!  I would not eat here again. I would rather spend more money and indulge my taste buds. I think most of us don't enjoy their meal when it's overpriced and below satisfactory. My bf barely finished the meal and in the words of our daughter said, \"me no like it.\"",

    "text": "We've now visited Border Grill for dinner, for lunch, and for tapas-style unlimited brunch, and I think it's time to stand up and applaud this inventive and tasty spin on Mexican cuisine.  I don't know that BG will be to everyone's taste, but it's unique enough that anyone who likes Mexican food should try it.  If you're a vegetarian, go for the brunch \"buffet.\" $25/pp gets you all the small plates you can eat, but it's not the price or the endless-eating that's the draw for me. It's the potato tacos served \"rajas\" style - onion, cheese, chile, and maybe a touch of crema? For some reason these aren't available on the lunch menu with all of the other taco offerings, a serious oversight.  The coconut French toast is as good as it sounds (and bigger than you'd expect). Brunch also has our staple appetizer, the plantain empanada. These are bold in taste and easy to inhale, although if you prefer a firmer empanada you might be disappointed.  Likewise on the green corn tamale, which instead of a firm slab is more like a sweet-yet-savoury oatmeal neatly tied up in a husk. It sounds kind of iffy, I know, and if you love (traditional?) firm tamales (as I do), you will be surprised, but one of these with a little of the bitey, tangy, pico de gallo is just a perfect, nuanced addition to the parade of brunch dishes. (When we ordered the tamales as an appetizer with lunch, we found ourselves less interested in eating more than one, though.)  Even though I claim to love all empanadas, the guava jam empanada was a little too coarse/dense for me, and the guava flavour seemed to make a counterpoint to sing out. The waitstaff suggests these for starters because they have them ready to go, and I was glad we had them early on, so everything afterward was that much better.  The fruit plate sounds boring, I know, but it's another \"ready right then\" item at brunch, and the passion fruit sauce is quite captivating. I almost ordered another one (but there was so much else to try).  The huevo ranchero was a little ordinary but good in taste, but it was so pretty that I didn't mind.  Even at brunch you still get chips and salsa. I don't really know how to describe these. They're not my favourite in town, but they're a little different from the usual and therefore interesting.  For lunch I get the poblano quesadilla off the appetizer menu, a concoction that vanquishes any worries that one is settling for some tired variant of cheese + bread. The cheese combination is exciting (sturdy manchego, melty panela, and tart, dry cotija), but the roasted peppers are just as much a star, and I've already sung the praises of the salsa. (I could just eat it by the spoonful. Soup spoonful-size, even.)  The only other \"substantial\" veg option for lunch is the chile relleno, which I instinctively avoid, having had too many oily, unmanageable, flavour-free chile rellenos in my life that would've been right at home at a carnival. (Not even good enough for a state fair.) But BG has impressed me so much that I think next time I'll give it a go.  For dinner there is one vegetarian main dish - the portabello mushroom mulitas. I would describe it as a huge pile of mushrooms, peppers, beans, onion, and sauce that somehow works. It's not something I've craved since, but again, it's unique enough that I wouldn't mind having it again at about half the size and half the price. BG boasts of its pro-environment position and its quality ingredients, which shows in that even the less interesting items are worth trying.  Save room for the flourless chocolate cake. It is angelic. How can anything be so light yet so packed with everything I like about chocolate and cake at the same time?  Drink service (soft drinks for us) is steady, with our bottle of table water always being replenished before it's empty. One of the best/worst decisions I've made here is to order the seasonal watermelon lemonade. It's toooo good, and my frugal side won't let me get refills.  The staff is always friendly at BG, and if you're a local, you can join their club and get a discount card for all future meals. (I think it's 10% off?)  We've only ever sat indoors at the tables, but these are so comfortable that we've never bothered to ask for a half-booth. The noise level is average, with all of the bar action in a side room.  I'm docking a star because I think BG, especially with its earth-friendly stance - needs to add potato tacos to the daily taco line-up for lunch, and I think they need one more vegetarian main item for dinner. The mulitas are ambitious and tasty, but for me they get dull and repetitive after four bites. I'm grateful not to have to settle for cheese enchiladas, sure, but some kind of enchilada for vegetarians done in the polished, creative BG-style is something I'd really like to see.",

    "text": "I was hoping that I would like this place more, but the food was not what I would expect from the Two Hot Tamales. To start, my house margarita was just how I like it, lots of fresh lime and a little salt, and they brought out warm chips and a trio of salsas. I may have filled up on chips while waiting for our food, but most of it failed to impress.   The sweet corn tamal was certainly not like my husband's abuela used to make, but the flavor really reminded me of a corn pudding casserole that my grandma makes for special occasions. Her's involves cans of creamed corn and a roux that is cooked in a microwave; the rest is a family secret. The chile relleno was OK, but lacking in some areas. The batter was soggy rather than crispy and the cheese medley just didn't have that oozing, melted quality that every good relleno needs. The beans on the side were bland, and the red and green rices provided more color than flavor. However, the biggest offense here was something labeled on the menu as \"Peruvian ceviche.\" It beared no resemblance to any ceviche I've ever seen a Peruvian make, even appearing to contain mayonnaise?!  The plate was messy, and my husband was unhappy. If you want to be bashed by my husband for eternity, serve him a bad ceviche. Worse yet, throw some watercress and orange segments on the plate, so I can laugh at the poorly planned garnish.  Our dessert was a simple plate of flan with 3 pieces of strawberry. I'm delighted to say that the flan was perfect: rich, dense, and creamy with a nice dark caramel flavor. My husband commented that this was the only dish he'd think about coming back for. It was not filled with air bubbles from overbaking, as many restaurants tend to serve it. Overcooked flan makes me want to cry. I can't say much for Border Grill, but at least the meal started and ended on positive notes.",

    "text": "Wow reviews are all over the place for the Border Grill.  I think this is a make sure you order the right thing kind of place and after reading all the glowing reviews about the Carnitas, I sure did.  Do your homework people, that's what Yelp is for.  I've been on a non-strip dining kick lately and down on the expensive absentee Celebrity Chef Restaurants that adorn every mega resort.  So I was pleasantly surprised that Susan Feniger & Mary Sue Milliken's Border Grill in the Mandalay Bay is serving up some great dishes worthy of the Top Chef Master's themselves.  Of course they aren't back in the kitchen, but everything I had tasted like they were.  Hats off to executive chef Michael Minor and his staff for putting a lot of love into these dishes.  I'm sure when you work in a celebrety chef's kitchen, it's hard to get any notoriety, even though you are the one making all the food.  If you've watched Susan & Mary Sue on TV over the years, you know they are about ultra fresh organic produce.  This is totally evident in their salsa and fresh seasonings mixed in their dishes.  The chips and trio of salsas, were very freshly made.  I usually don't like tomatillo salsa very much, but this was wonderful and my favorite of the three with a beautiful lime taste.  The guacamole was on the mild side allowing you to taste the avocado.  Sitting next to it on the plate was a pico de gallo, and some greens.  I'm not sure what variety, I just balanced a few on each chip along with the pico and guacamole for some extra flavor and texture.  I forgot to snap a photo of my own so here's Tracy W.'s <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#Kzcg9JBVMMUfIaA8hkgCkg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bord...</a>  The Queso Funditio was very thick, full of melted authentic Mexican cheeses, chorizo, and roasted red peppers.  There was also a nice amount of guacamole cream on top that satisfied both looks and flavor.  Even though their chips are very thick, don't think you are going to be scooping this dip up with the chip, you will need to place it on your chip with a fork. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#T5TZf-_vEO56FHmNouqOIw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bord...</a>  The star of the show was my Tacate Carnitas.  The shredded pork was moist and very flavorful.  It was served on a bed of roasted corn grits.  These grits were delicious and contained lots of butter for sure.  You could really taste the corn meal flavor to them bringing to mind the flavor of a tamale.  Surrounding the edge of the plate was a bold black bean puree.  The black beans are mixed with huitlacoche, which is a mushroom like fungus that grows on corn.  It has a very earthy flavor that really made these black beans something special.  How do you make a pork dish even better?  Top it with crunchy bacon of course.  Not just any bacon but chipotle glazed bacon.  It really added a texture here that made each bite enjoyable, after all there is a lot of mushy stuff on the plate.  It was served with a giant flour tortilla.  I just ripped pieces off and used it to balance all of these wonderful flavors together with each bite.  This is a True 5 star dish and the best carnitas I've had. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#Cz0ORcEa5RD1dpRQHYzCIw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bord...</a>  My wife's dish was a little more plain, the Carne Asada Tacos.  I can see being a little disappointed with this dish, especially in comparison with my carnitas.  The chopped up carne asada was a little dry and needed to be dressed up with salsa and topped with some black beans and oaxaca cheese, otherwise it just seemed like plain old street tacos with a $18 price tag.  The two different kinds of rice were nicely infused with fresh herbs, although it added to the dryness of the plate. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#pdMM2_CIiWmmresjLS3jcA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bord...</a>  We came here for lunch on a weekday, thinking it should be no wait, but was packed.  The location is right next to all the conference rooms at the Mandalay Bay, thus everyone was dressed in suits and trying to grab a quick nearby bite.  After a few minute wait we got a table outside on the patio overlooking the Mandalay Bay Pool.  It wasn't too hot since it was April, but I couldn't help but notice they have a Big Ass Fan that covers the whole patio.  It's the size of an airplane propeller.  It's one Big Ass Fan. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#lhl0l6qC71PlGeAfLc012w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bord...</a>  I'm now a Big Ass Fan of Border Grill, go have the Tecate Carnitas and you'll be a Big Ass Fan too!",

One of the girls in our party is Gluten free, and they offer several GF options which, also includes their chips (which are ridiculously delicious).  Their prices are similar to a decent Mexican restaurant in BOS which, was great.  I am not big on Mexican Food, at all.  I strip what everyone loves out of the meals and eat basically the protein, the carb and the cheese, I love the flavors.  With that said, the Queso Fundido is AH-MAZZZZ-ING.  This is a MUST try!  I ordered the carne quesadilla with only the carne and the cheese (no onions, guac, salsa, etc.).  This CAN be shared with someone else, the portion is huge.  It is cut into 6 slices, in fact, I took half of it to go.  Actually, this went for all of our meals, so, try to share what you can to avoid leftovers, especially if you do not have a micro in your hotel.  This is in no way a negative criticism, for $19, it is the perfect size.  The drinks were great, I did the Cadillac Margarita, it was so good, I had to try it twice.. = )   Our waiter was Michael, he was attentive, and very knowledgeable and considerate to my friends Gluten Free allergy.  In fact, I put the flour tortilla from the queso on top of the chips and he has pointed out that I \"contaminated\" the chips (jokingly of course..) and brought her \"her own chips that no one else should touch\".  He was very witty and made us laugh.  If you love Mexican, give this place a whirl.  We sat on the covered patio and it was breathtaking.",

    "text": "I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Tacos, which consisted of three shrimp tacos topped with guacamole and cucumber slaw. The dish included rice and beans, but I opted for rice only. Does anyone else despise menu items that are deceivingly labeled \"spicy\"? Since when did \"spicy\" become \"not spicy at all\"? (insert eye roll here)  After some eavesdropping, I learned that you could do a triad of taco options. I would've done shrimp, pork, and carne asada if I overheard that before I ordered.  The waitress was friendly, but the hostesses are completely clueless. I stood at the hostess table for a few minutes before they realized I needed a table.   Due to the unnecessarily high prices (each plate is at least $15), I'll opt for one of the many other Vegas eateries the next time I'm in town.",

We had batter-dipped fish tacos, carne asade tacos, and chicken penuches, and they were all phenomenal. Flavors are well-balanced, nothing over-seasoned, and very creative recipes. VERY GOOD FOOD! Lovely decor, excellent wait staff (especially Jessica) and good drinks.  Definitely a great choice for lunch, if you're anywhere near Mandalay Bay.",

They also have a small, standard mexican menu for those not into the AYCE like my wife. They have a great selection of various dishes from our favorite, the Chilaquiles, to a breakfast sandwich and pretty much a little of everything in between. The food was served fresh and the service was solid. I didn't notice anyone with an empty drink for anymore than a few moments. And since nearly all of us were doing the AYCE, we constantly had various plates of food to eat on the table. One thing that stood out to me was how loud this place was, definitely above average as I found myself speaking quite loud just so the person sitting across from me could hear. As for value, be prepared to open your wallet. as this place is pretty pricey.",

This isn't a normal buffet, you pay $34.95 ( or about) and another $10 if you want bottomless mimosas included. There are about 20 small plates on the menu. You order what you want or all of them. The trouble was it got busy and the food came out lukewarm or cool. We ordered many different small plates, but they didn't come out in order or some not at all. The wait staff couldn't remember what we ordered so they kept bringing out plates we already tasted or ordered. There were several we never got, we finally gave up after an hour and a half. Don't get me wrong, we had plenty of food, the wait staff was very attentive, we were disappointed at not getting to taste some of the more popular dishes  The processes need to improved, unless this was just an off day.",

    "text": "I've got to add Border Grill to my list of Top Chef Masters restaurants that disappoint. It joins a couple other spots I've had the misfortune of visiting: Zentan by Susur Lee in Washington DC and RIck Moonen's RM Seafood Room here in Vegas. I've been to Border Grill three times now and either the quality has slipped or my expectations have risen because with each visit I leave less satisfied.  We decided to come here for a family night out -- yup, we had the kid in tow and were looking for a family-friendly spot that would make him happy and have good enough food to make us happy. They get points for having a kids menu (and they also have a gluten-free menu for anyone looking for that). Unfortunately, the food didn't thrill any of us.  The plantain empanadas ($9) are filled with a mixture of roasted plantains, black beans, poblano peppers and cotija cheese. The sweetness of the plantains dominated the flavor of the dish. I love plantains, so that isn't necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. The empanada dough was more mushy then flaky, which was a disappointment. There are four per order, so plan to share.  The Baja ceviche ($15) is a huge order of lime marinated halibut and shrimp sitting on a corn tortilla with slice avocado sitting on top. There was too much lime and the fish didn't taste all that fresh. This also seemed like a dish that was mass produced and was probably sitting around in those lime juices for quite some time.  The first entree to make it's way to the table was something off of their 'Specials' menu. It was shrimp stuffed with crab and wrapped in bacon with some sort of cilantro pesto sauce or something (I can't remember exactly) ($26). It sounded awesome, but it turned out to be a hot mess. Too much bacon, no detectable crab in or near the shrimp, and a million ingredients that over-complicated the dish.  The Negro Modelo braised short ribs ($29) were much better. It came with two large chunks of boneless beef atop corn polenta and a cherry tomato salsa fresca with a molasses habanero BBQ sauce. The beef could have been more tender, but the flavors were pretty good with a slight bitterness from the Negro Modelo and sweetness from the sauce. It wasn't overly spicy.   The kids cheese quesadilla ($4) was filled with cotija cheese (I think?). Fine for adults, but for a 3 yr old with developing taste buds... no. He wasn't a fan. Too bad they didn't just have a cheddar/monterey jack cheese blend.  Our little guy did get a scoop of chocolate ice cream ($3) accompanied with fresh berries. He loved the ice cream, but is still learning to like berries.  The wife and I split the flourless chocolate cake with prickly pear lychee sauce and raspberries ($10). It was heavier/denser than we expected but still rich and chocolatey. The crust and bottom of the cake were slightly overcooked and hard.  Along with mediocre food, we had spotty service. Our server was friendly but very busy and disappeared often. This isn't fine dining but at the prices they charge they could step things up a bit. Little things like clearing empty dishes and replacing silverware would make a big difference. The whole atmosphere was more laid back then I remember (the last time we were here was probably 2+ years ago). It almost felt like a small step up from a Chevy's Fresh Mex or one of those type of places. They also charge fifty cents for water per person. Although my son didn't get water they charged him anyway.    Another thing that was annoying was how they decided to sit people right next to us when most of the dining room was completely empty. Why not space people out more?  It was a pricey meal for what we got, but at least we were armed with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate. We also tried to use the Border Grill VIP card, which normally gets us a 15% discount but management said they couldn't take both the gift certificate and VIP card.",

There are also many different areas to enjoy your meal: inside, outside on a covered patio, or completely outside by the pool (shaded by trees).  I love me any place with some patio seating.  The brunch food comes out as small plates, so you can try a lot of the different dishes and get your money's worth.  I guess the best way to describe it would be like tapas.  I really enjoyed the shrimp and grits.  Like...so much I got three orders of them.  My other favorite was the chorizo and egg tacos.  My one complaint, I felt like some of the dishes had too much egg in them in proportion to other ingredients.  I can only take so much egg!  But the Mexican twist on breakfast favorites was something I'm really glad I tried.  The mimosas come in different flavors like classic orange, pomegranite, and passion fruit.  And they don't skimp on them!  They come in some pretty hefty pour flutes!  You know, in all honesty, I don't know if I'd go again just because it's quite a bit of money to spend on breakfast, but I would definitely say you have to go at least once and expereince this!",

To be sure, when I woke up hungover, I dove into my cold steak quesadilla I left sitting out in our room overnight, and it was still freakin' delicious.   Found out about this gem from my friend's co-worker. It was all the way at the opposite end of the strip from us, but SO worth it! Started out with an amazing pina colada with toasted coconut on the edge of the glass. (Because the best thing to do when very drunk is keep drinking, of course. Well...at least in Vegas) Only complaint was that it was SO thick that I couldn't even get it through the straw! Had to wait til it melted a bit, and even then, was still difficult to get. For appetizers we started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. All items were SO fresh and the chips were salty and delicious. We ordered some quinoa fritters which were amazing and definitely unique! Quinoa and cheese deep friend in batter...heavenly. That's what I love about this place, they make healthy eating fun, by dipping the healthy food in melted cheese and then deep frying it. Ordered queso fundido which was perfection and probably the best I have ever had. Sooooo creamy, cheesy, and flavorful. It was a bowl of melted cheese sauce with a crunchy layer of cheese on top, which is the best idea in humanity's history. Afterwards, got a steak quesadilla which was PERFECT. The most flavorful steak I have ever had in a quesadilla. Even the next morning it was to die for. I'm happy that even though I was drunk when I met this quesadilla and took its leftovers home, when I woke up the next morning and it was still delicious, I was able to say I took home a \"10\" the night before. I feel like this is one of those places you never hear people talk about, but I do...all of the time. GO! The hype is real!",

The chips were good, but overall the salsa was boring. One of them was smoked, which has a really good taste to it.   The $14 Cadillac Margarita, was weak and tasted like it was mixed with Lemon-Lime Gatorade and crap tequila. Couldn't even taste the Grand Marnier that was allegedly included.   For the meal, I had the skirt steak. It came out lukewarm at best and was undercoooked (I ordered medium) but I ate it anyways. Not impressed, the meat was nice and tender but also pretty tasteless.   If you're looking for good Mexi in Vegas, get off the strip and head down to Viva Michoacan in Henderson for some good food.",

We had the skirt steak, which wasn't too bad and is the main reason for the second star.  We also had the special braised short rib which was an absolute joke.  It was nothing more than a chunk of smoked pork butt that was poorly seasoned on top of spinach mashed potatoes that were ok at best and was way overpriced at $34.  They should be ashamed of that.  My kids had the carne asada quesadillas which they seemed to like but on return to our room my youngest got sick to his stomach and puked all of his up!   We also had the fresh guacamole app and its was nothing spectacular.  For a restaurant to tout its creations from a top chef, this one was a big disappointment.  I believe the Mexican restaurant over in the Luxor would have been a much better experience for us.  In my opinion the Border Grill is wasting valuable space in the Mandalay complex.",

This was one of the best brunches I've had as it played perfectly to my dislike of commitment / deficit of attention, plus the food was super flavorful, perfectly cooked, etc.  Between the 4 of us, we tried almost everything, I think. Table faves included the Chilequiles, Huevos Rancheros, Chorizo and Egg taco, Steak and Egg, Guava Empanada, Yucatan Egg Benedict, and Coconut French Toast (for dessert, of course).  So all that is $25 each, and for $5 more, you get bottomless mimosas-- The orange mimosas were boring, but the pomegranate and passion fruit were quite tasty.   Our server was great too - had our next mimosas out before the one before it was empty... kept the pace up faster at first, and then slowed down as we got more and more full, attentive but not pressuring. Great atmosphere sitting outside overlooking the Mandalay Bay pool area, too.  All around a win - I'm already looking forward to going back!",

The champagne brunch normally goes for $29.99 per person, but we had the VIP hook-up.  This is a tapas-style presentation, so you just order to your heart's content--heaven!  We had chips and salsa, cinnamon apple pancakes, guava empanadas plaintain empanadas, fresh fruit plates, carne asada tacos, green corn tamales, machaca chilaquiles, chipotle shrimp BLTs,  and coconut French toast.  Ay yai yai--muy delicioso!  The plaintain empanadas were not that great, but I would definitely recommend the green corn tamales, carne asada tacos, and chipotle shrimp BLTs.  We sat out on the patio, had great service throughout, and our waitress never blinked an eye when we kept ordering more food and mimosas!  I love a great deal on great food and that's what we got today.  Buena suerte!",

All you can eat so they keep the dishes coming til you tell them to stop. Also bottomless mimosas for $10. The food is great, Mexican with a twist. Very flavorful! Try the brunch so you could try a little of everything! Never had a problem with service however, the restrooms are outside the restaurant and quite a walk if you've got a broken foot like me.",

    "text": "Border Grill is now serving brunch!  I love a good breakfast - and they do it right by me.  Brunch is served as a tapas menu, perfect for trying a little bit of everything.  For $29.95 you can get an 'all you can eat' brunch with champagne - or pomegranate mimosas as I had (delicious, by the way).  There is nothing wrong with eating chips and salsa at 10 o'clock in the morning - especially their fresh, homemade varieties Border Grill has to offer, my favorite being the salsa Verde -  it is so flavorful.  Make sure to ask for the spicy salsa if they don't bring it automatically, it is amazing too.  The tapas menu is a great idea to try a bit of everything and not get too full off just one item - the waiter will take about 2-3 orders at a time, and spread the delivery out so you are not overwhelmed with food on the table.  With the menu consisting of about 15 or so items, it is perfect for a variety of flavors to start your day.  For starters, I had the Eggs Benedict.  Now, this is not your average Eggs Benny by any stretch of the imagination.  Instead of an English Muffin, they use a light and fluffy biscuit topped with Yucatan pork, a poached egg, fresh Hollandaise sauce and pickled onions.  Heaven.    Next on the list was Steak and Eggs.  I have honestly never ordered this as a breakfast item - so I figured it was time to try it.  The tender carne asada was sliced thin, but not too thin, sitting on top of a poblano potato pancake and an egg (over medium for me please) sitting on top.  I will never be able to order Steak and Eggs any where else now.    I tried the Shrimp BLT - sounds more lunch-y, but hey, where there is shrimp, so am I.  The bread was sliced thin, which was great since by this point, I am already starting to get full. Inside lies shrimp, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes, all seasoned to perfection.    My friend ordered Coconut French Toast.  I am not a French Toast or coconut fan (which is why she ordered it..)  Although, it was actually pretty darn good - this consisted of Sourdough bread, coconut syrup and sauteed bananas.  Sweet, but not too much, a definite surprise - I might even order it on my own next time.  The Green Corn Tamale came out next - and dear Lord - if I could eat this at every meal, I would.  Trust me.  The presentation is great, part of it is in a tamale 'purse' - the other part served along side sour cream and fresh pico de gallo. Yummy.    We also ordered the fresh fruit they were offering on the brunch menu.  The fruit was perfectly in season with a drizzle of passion fruit sauce.  Oh My.    Besides the food being excellent, the service is something that is outstanding as well.  Every wait staff member knows the menu inside and out, has great recommendations, and provides a level of service that you will remember almost as much as the food itself.  Good customer service will never go out of style, and as far as I am concerned, neither will this Brunch. Border Grill nailed it, again.",

The high points were definitely the steak and eggs, chilaquiles, the frittata, pbj & bacon sandwich and the giant fruit plate (with passionfruit sauce!) that they brought out initially. Everything is made to order, so you get the variety of going to say, a buffet, but also the freshness of eating in a regular restaurant. The service was very friendly as well, so no complaints there. At $35 per person, you definitely need to bring your appetite, but I still would highly recommend.",

My son ordered the Poblano Chicken Enchiladas ($24) They were delicious, he loved it and the wild mushrooms it was topped with were amazing.  I had the special of Crispy Steak Tacos (not sure the price, but less than the enchiladas) topped with a cucumber tomato marinated mixture. I was very happy with my choice as well.  The rice looked a bit dry but I was wrong, it was perfect and seasoned just right.  Service was great and our only regret was that we snacked on too many chips, and neither one of us were able to finish our lunch. We would eat here again.",

Other reviews said get the Tuna Ceviche but the wifey didn't give it her Mexican stamp of approval.  She said it was too creamy even though I thought it was pretty good.  I had the pork dinner (I can't remember the name) and it was super tender and very flavorful.  My only complaint was that the rice was hard.  It wasn't too busy when we went and they have indoor and outdoor seating as well as a bar area.  The service is good.  The price is actually not as high as other restaurants in Vegas but still higher than outside Vegas.  Stop by here if you are craving Mexican and are on the southern edge of the Strip.",

It looked like they were packed with people from the convention and the servers looked really overwhelmed. There were empty tables but however the hostess told me the only available seating was either at he bar or high tables at the bar. Me and some other expo attendee agreed to share one high table but we were waiting for the waitress for a long time and no one came to the table. I spotted one empty seat at the bar and ran for it. Once finally seated, I ordered a few tacos and a water and the person at the bar gave me an annoyed look for ordering only water and finally when my order arrived it was not correct and arrived with no silverware and napkins. Since I was sitting at the bar I tried to put my purse down and looked down and the floor was filthy and disgusting, It would be nice if there were purse hooks. I decided because of the lack of time to take my food to go and finish my meal at home. I ordered pork tacos & it was an unbelievable amount of fat with the meat. When someone cuts the meat for the taco you would think they would remove the fat but the tacos were about 50% fat. yuck!",

We ordered our appetizers right away with our drinks, but 45 minutes went by before we actually got them. Our appetizers were soggy - you could just tell everything had been sitting. We were too hungry to send it back, especially since we had no idea how long it would take the second time. The plantain empanadas tasted good, and I enjoyed the spice of the quinoa fritters. Which I suppose at one point were crispy.   Our entrees had also been sitting, and arrived right as our appetizers were being cleared, resulting in our having no silverware. Everything had sort of started to congeal together. Unable to flag anyone down I had to resort to taking utensils off of another table.   The pork special had very nice flavors, and my husband inhaled his chicken mole. The salad that accompanied the mole was quite tasty!   I think the food would be good if delivered promptly but I would not return due to the service. Maybe eating over in the bar would be better.",

I cant say enough about how top notch the entire meal was. Entire staff was so nice to us, we originally sat out on the covered patio, it got a liitle too hot oustside to enjoy our meal so they moved us inside to the air conditioned dining room. Dont be afraid to share a meal to save some money. After a Margarita and some water, we could not have finished a full meal each.

    "text": "The first night of our conference, I met my coworker here for some margaritas. Boy was it slammed! The space is comprised of a small bar area and smaller restaurant.  They also have no bathrooms, so beware that if you drink too much water, you have to go downstairs to pee.    We found seats in the bar at a high top and there were a few other high top tables open. So we waited. And waited. And waited. The waitress on duty seemed to be approaching the tables of men who sat down 10 minutes after we did before she ever greeted us. So we approached the male bartender who happily gave us menus. After about 20 more minutes of the waitress ignoring us, we approached her as she walked by us again and asked if we could order drinks. Sure. So I ordered a blood orange margarita without the mole on the rim and my coworker ordered some kind of margarita with pineapple in it.  The margaritas were fabulous. They both seemed to have been made skinny with agave in them and lime juice.  That was great. Sadly, our service was terrible.  As the crowd thinned out to only 4 tables, our waitress still did not approach us until we literally walked up to her. I can only guess she may have thought 2 young looking women would've tipped her less generously than the older gentlemen at the conference. That sort of becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because once you ignore us for so long, your tip decreases. My bet is that this place could use some systems and processes to handle busy hours.  But I wasn't all that impressed.",

The tortilla chips are great. Just thick enough to be crunchy rather than crispy, and the right level of salt. Two of the three salsas were pretty good, but not even remotely spicy so we asked if they had anything with some kick. Our waiter brought their spicy salsa, but it was really disappointing - kinda bland, not spicy on my tongue, then fiery in the back of my throat - all of the bad of spicy food and none of the good. We went back to the two that we liked.  Their guacamole was very good. Extremely fresh and flavorful, and they let the avocado shine.  Based on our waiter's suggestion, I ordered their Yucatan pork. It was pretty good, but not any better than I've had in family taqueria's in the bay area. Solid refried beans, completely unremarkable spanish rice, moist pork. The corn tortillas were dry around the edges so I stopped after eating one of them. Probably the best thing on the plate was the plantains.  The service was very good from start to finish.  My overall impression is that this was a reasonable place that I wouldn't avoid, but neither did it leave me with anything that screamed \"I have to return.\"",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for work and attended a week-long conference at Mandalay Bay.  I didn't plan out lunch very well and on the first day I ended up in the food court eating a Nathan's foot long hot dog and fries for $11 and I was pissed.  I was determined to find something better, and I had walked past this place called \"Border Grill\" while walking from the convention area back to my car in the parking garage, so I looked it up on Yelp.  It had good reviews, so I tried it out for lunch the 2nd day of the conference.  Pros: -Food is good and authentic -Seating is fast and they will get you out on time to get back to work -service is fairly good  Cons: -a little rushed -expensive, if you're not paying attention.  As I was seated, the waitress said \"Chips and salsa are coming, do you want some guacamole as well?:  I should have known enough to ask what it cost but I didn't.  I think they rely on most people assuming that it is free.  I was served a plate of decent chips and salsa, and then a huge plate of chips and guacamole.  I ordered the special smoked salmon bagel, which was very good.  In fact, it was extremely filling considering it sounds like a brunch item.  When I got the check, though, I saw the guacamole plate was ten dollars!  This raised my lunch from ~25 to about ~35 bucks.  Kind of a scam, if you ask me.  The waitress should tell you the price of the guacamole when offering it, I've never been anywhere that a guac+chips plate was more than 4 or 5 bucks.  I left a minimal tip (don't feel too bad for her, my minimal tip is 11%).  She should have told me up front what the costs were.  Anywyay, lunch was very good, certainly better than Nathans, and I would go again, but be careful about what you order.",

Kobe beef tacos: disgusting according to my hubby...   The food was bad, the service was great, our waitress was super nice and attentive. The view from our patio table was great, it would be even better in summer.

I had the pineapple vanilla brunch margarita in the \"jefe\" size and it was amazing!

First let me say that Nikki (Our event coordinator at Border Grill) was incredible. She was in constant contact with us and I know that my wife would have been going crazy with all the pressure of planning if it weren't for her.  On to the restaurant itself. We ate at Border Grills 2 separate times in a 5 day period in addition to the 3rd time which was at our wedding reception. I have not eaten anything at this restaurant that I would say was not delicious. Everything was excellent.  Not only did they handle our wedding reception beautifully, but they treated us like family 2 nights later when we had our final dinner in Vegas at their restaurant again. I don't know how to explain to someone who hasn't gotten married what a special day it is that can easily be ruined by bad service or staff that doesn't care.   We didn't have that issue at this Border Grill. Autumn and Brandon were fantastic. The manager was incredible and whoever the chef for our reception was, they deserve a shout out (if I only knew your name/s)   Thank you for making our wedding reception unforgettable!",

Local celeb chef Mike Minor is back in the house (and kitchen) and the food is even more amazing than before! The chefs daily specials are absolutely incredible every time I dine here!  The menu has a variety of crafted cocktails and now more of a craft beer selection, the Burro Caliente being my favorite (has a bit of a kick which I love), and the margaritas are only made from agave and lime so naturally are INCREDIBLE! The brunch on the weekends are amazing and the selection is insane especially for the price ($39), but my favorite is dinner. They have a small plate option mimicked after their brunch style on the dinner menu now that allowed me to taste everything on the menu. $55$? How do they even make money? A girl can eat! Everything was yummy. Octopus, ceviche, grilled corn, brisket taquitos, skirt steak, shrimp and scallops, enchiladas.... wow. I have to respect and tip my hat to the ladies ( Mary Sue and Susan ) for their dedication to giving back to the community and the several organizations they are in support of.  Yes, there is a 50 cent charge for water now, but what they are doing is really inspiring. The organization they donate the proceeds (not profit) to, One Drop (I had to google it) assists people in need of clean drinking water. I got the feels and a little education on the matter when I asked our server about it.  All in all, I bring most everyone who comes in town to visit here for either brunch or dinner and it usually ends up being their favorite experience. Keep it up Border Grill! I can't wait to see what's next!",

Well, I'm really glad for my visit last week and the wonderful experience we had. The food was delicious and the service was insanely fantastic. Our server, Jessica was the most thoughtful, kindest, and simply amazing. Everyone seriously deserves high praises for the top-notch service!  Border Classics ($19): Chicken Panuchos (Black bean stuffed tortillas), Green Corn Tamales (Sweet corn, sour cream, salsa fresca), and Plantain Empanadas (Roasted plantains, organic black beans, poblano, cotija cheese). I absolutely loved the panuchos; so good! The tamales were pretty great considering that I don't usually like sweet versions. The empanadas were okay.  Wagyu Beef Sopes ($14): Guajillo chile marinated Wagyu beef, corn masa \"little boat\", and mango red cabbage mint slaw. The meat was delicious and tender (although a bit sweeter than I prefer), plus the fixings worked well. It was interestingly just one sope and the price is a bit steep for it.  Restaurant Week 2015 Dinner $50.15 Donation Level: Silver Platter ($4)  FIRST \"Chorizo\" Beef Tartare: Quail egg and potato puff. Very good beef tartare and I loved the puff - wish there was more!  SECOND Gaucho Steak: Grilled ribeye, chimichurri, crispy garlic potato, and huitlacoche butter. This steak was very generous in size and cooked well. The whole dish was super flavorful. I loved the potato! Just really good steak.  THIRD Smoked Chocolate Brownie: Cinnamon smoke, chocolate sauce, and almond ice cream. The stack of brownie was covered in one of their short glasses, filled with smoke. The cup was removed as soon as the plate hit our table and you could still see the smoke swirling. Very cool. The brownie was delicious and I loved the addition of smoke. Great ice cream, too.",

When booking this reservation, the staff worked with me closely and really helped me out putting together a menu for the whole party. Which by the way, they were able to accommodate 22 people! Our customized menu consisted of Cuban panini sliders and Beef brisket flautas for starters. We moved into our chopped Mexican salad and then the main course. We had a choice between grilled skirt steak, topped with caramelized onions or, like marinated half chicken. To top it all off, our final course consisted of our tres leches cake- which was a crowd favorite. Our servers Autum and Gatsby were very friendly and attentive. Really pleased with how everything turned out!!",

The best part is if you're here with a few people you can try practically everything since it's all small plates.   Delicious, free-flowing drinks - bottomless mimosas available for $10, made with delicious fresh fruit syrups and purees. We had blood orange, pomegranate, passion fruit and mango, I think. You best believe we got our drink on!   Excellent, friendly and above-and-beyond service: Gatsby served us and she was just awesome. She basically quarterbacked ordering for us and put orders in for things she thought we'd enjoy, and she knocked it out of the park! Basically just kept drinks and food coming until we couldn't eat another bite. Plus she was fun to talk to, great rapport. There are good servers out there, but she was definitely beyond!

    "text": "I love Mexican food, the flavors and availability to eat mostly Paleo (avoiding the chips is so hard) is one thing I always enjoy when picking where to eat.  Border Grill at Mandalay Bay is authentic Mexican as chefs Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger went to Mexico years ago to study street foods and in small family owned restaurants, I love reading about their culinary history. Having lived for 3 years in Mexico City, I appreciate that style of Mexican that differs from the regular American Tex-Mex. Border Grill has a lot of dishes that are different from most American Mexican restaurants and so when we go I truly enjoy each plate.  Moderately priced for the quality, it's a good spot for a date or business dinner if you're in that area.  Service is always very good, and cocktails are nice and strong the way I like it.  Only downside is the restroom is all the way down the stairs towards the ballrooms on the bottom level. After a couple cocktails it's kind of a pain to trek all the way down a huge flight of stairs and down a long hallway. Not sure why so many of the restaurants in casinos do that ( I suppose so you'll be tempted to play a slot machine or table game on your way back?), but it's annoying.  Dinner for two with guacamole and chips, two dinners and a couple cocktails is around $120. Pretty standard price for a well known restaurant on the strip.",

Our server, who I believe was named Candice, was super friendly and knew the details of so many menu items. She even have us her favorites without asking! She saw my drink getting low and quickly refilled. Awesome. She was super fast with service and very friendly.   Food: Amazing!!!! I've never had more tasty ceviche! We ordered a three sampler version which provided a good variety and was super fresh. This place prides itself on being fresh and it was!  My dinner was the strip streak with a mushroom quesadilla. I ordered mid-rare and it was cooked perfectly. I got the mushrooms without the tortilla and they were the bomb! The steak was soooo big I could not finish it.  Overall: This place doesn't disappoint at all. I would highly recommend no matter what! You gotta try this place!",

    "text": "We had dinner at Border Grill on a Saturday night.  The place was about 2/3 full, but the patio, where we ate, was completely full.  It was a nice cool evening, and they had the heaters on.  We were directly underneath them, and I actually found myself a little warm.  Not uncomfortably so, but I definitely was noticing the heat.   That wasn't an issue however; I clearly enjoyed the meal.  To start, you are brought 3 different salsas and chips.  Of these, the green was my favorite, although I liked both red salsas as well.  Our table of 5 decided to get the queso fundido to start, and 2 of them got guacamole.  The guacamole was good, certainly fresh.  It could have used some heat for my taste.  The queso was FANTASTIC.  Made with chorizo, it got crispy on the bottom where the cheese melted against the hot metal bowl.  I seriously considered ordering another serving of this, it was that good.  Crispy, melty, a little salty from the sausage.  Just a fantastic cheese dish.    The meal only got better from there.  The wife had the short rib enchiladas, which were great.  Loved the sauce, and they were covered with a ton of veggies.  But, the showstopper was my meal:  the gaucho steak.  This is a large ribeye (cooked to a textbook medium rare, by the way) on top of a HUGE bed of maybe the best chilaquiles I've ever eaten and served with a roasted onion half and roasted garlic.  If ever a dish was composed well, this is that dish.  All of this stuff went together fantastically well, you could get a perfect bite with all 4 components.  The chilaquiles were soaked in sauce and served with what appeared to be 2 different types of cheese.  The garlic and onion were roasted long enough to become sweet, flavorful and soft, but not so long that they were burnt in anyway.    I've been to many of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  While the gaucho steak isn't going to make me forget the reserve ribeye at Carnevino, it certainly is one of the more memorable steaks I've had on the strip.  Can't recommend this enough if you are a beef person.  For dessert, the table had the tres leches cake and the chocolate cake (can't remember the exact menu title).  Both were good, but I found the chocolate cake to be far superior.  Service was good, they leave a carafe of water on your table, which was nice.  And, when that was empty, they brought a replacement very quickly.  We'll definitely return, and I 100% will order the gaucho steak next time.",

I'd been there once before in July and had enjoyed a kale salad with shrimp so much that I wanted to experience it again. This time I ordered the octopus asada and lamb adobo tacos and everything was perfectly prepared and delicious. I love how they take a traditional dish and add a few creative touches to make it even better. The service is fantastic as well, and I'm a stickler for great service. The manager that evening, Darlene, came over to make sure everything was good with my orders, and she made my experience even better than I'd expected. I left with a definite \"wow\" feeling. I went back the next day for lunch and the Tijuana kale Caesar with shrimp was everything I'd remembered it to be from July. Definitely add this to your list of casual, well-priced restaurants to visit in Vegas.",

I don't mind paying that kind of money, but I expect a clean restaurant, professional waiters, and good food. The carpets had food and trash all over the restaurant even though our reservation was at 7:00 pm.  Our waiter looked unkempt and my daughter had to send back her drink because it did not taste right.  I also expect that a restaurant this expensive would have a restroom!  Yes, this is not a typo.  This restaurant has NO restrooms.  If you want to go to a restroom, you have to walk out of the restaurant, then walk down two flights of stairs, turn left and then walk even more before you find the restroom.  My steak was cold and they left part of our food out and we had to remind them to bring it to us.  Here is another False advertising, they have a picture of skirt steak which is so big that covers from one side of the dish to the other.  But, the one we got was four inches long and looked like less than half of the size of the steak advertised.  Three of us had ordered the skirt steak and we all got the same size steak, which was less than half the size of steak they advertise on Yelp.  There are so many other good restaurants in Vegas - but this is not one if them - not even by a long shot.  Save your money and try a different place!",

We were just expecting to develop a severe underbite afterwards :)  Eat here whenever you are hitting up a concert at Mandalay Bay and need a great, close place to eat!!",

    "text": "I love (!) Susan Feniger, but it seems like the price-gouging in Vegas turned this place into a yawn.  Way overrated for upscale Mexican, but still an okay meal if you are stuck (nay, trapped) in the Mandalay Bay and need to eat.  I still can't fathom why restaurants get away with $9 tableside guacamole service out of the cost of 50 cents worth of ingredients.  I should just hand over $10 bucks, have them punch me in the face and then tell them to keep the change.  Guac was perfectly fine, but not for $9.  Crab nachos were a good sized portion, but light on the crab.  Again, no surprise given that this place is stingy when it comes to the good ingredients.  Carnitas tacos were tender and succulent, but ridiculous at $17.  They were literally $2 taco truck tacos.  Mango margarita was delectable at the time, but not memorable.  I don't know, kids.  Maybe I'm old and grumpy, but I don't feel like I'm any stingier with my dough.  I just want to pay out the gills if the food will absolutely warrant it because it's going to blow my mind.  Border Grill didn't blow my mind so much as my pay check.  I'm over it.",

To start off, the staff were lovely - attentive, humorous, engaging and very helpful.  The decor is inviting and vibrant, setting the tone just right for a fun night. Yeah, it's just Mexican food, but it's fricking delicious Mexican food.  To start, would recommend the appetizer sampler - the most amazing corn tamale ever along with other succulent delectations.  I also recommend the braised short ribs - some of the best short ribs I've ever had, and believe me when I say, I've eaten a whole bunch.  My wife had the special which was a seafood chile relleno which was a little heavy on the carrot salad and sauces, and a little light on the crab. All in all, worth the trip down the strip.",

I went here with my parents for my 21st birthday, and I have never experienced such wonderful food. First was the appetizers - We had the sampler (which for me, since I'm gluten- intolerant, was altered). It contained two plantain empanadas and the most exquisite thing I've ever eaten in my life - a green corn tamale. It was sweet and just wonderfully delicious. Then came dinner - a HUGE and perfectly cooked portion of premium grade steak with a small fresh field salad, mole and aoli. Divine. Then dessert - the most rich and wonderful gluten free chocolate cake ever. With vanilla bean ice cream. This place is amazing. I would recommend this place for those of you with gluten intolerance because its amazing. But skip the shrimp.",

    "text": "Truly a Top Chef Master Showing!  Our dining experience started with being promptly sat when we arrived at the podium met by the friendly hostess. We had 3 adults, 1 3 yr. old and a baby and were sat in their downstairs dining room which was our first experience in that location. Couldn't of been happier. Noise level was accommodating (baby didn't wake up) and our 3 yr old was entertained by the crayons and kids menu brought to the table by Las Vegas's Most Friendly Most Knowledgeable Waitress Autumn. She interacted with our 3 yr. old, remembered his name and made us feel like the center of attention throughout the meal. One of the best service staff's I've had the dining pleasure of. One thing I like to do when I dine is start off with \"What's the best thing on the menu?\" 8 out of 10 you will have the Server \"push\" either the most expensive dish on the menu or the \"catch of the day\". This was not the case at all. Autumn recommended we start with the Quinoa Fritters and Peruvian Ceviche. Both were excellent choices and not to be missed. Side note is that today's Peruvian Ceviche used \"Ono\" so there was a little fishy taste, but we've had this 2x on other occasions and the flavor was on point. In regards to entrees, Autumn recommended the \"Chicken Mole\" and the \"Pescado Veracruzano\". I had the Chicken Mole, which might have been the best decision I have made ALL month. The Chicken breast was juicy, the skin crispy, the flavors completely delectable and not overly salty. A HUGE portion as well. Buyer beware if you fill up on their delicious Chips N Gauc. Needless to say, i'll be reheating this tomorrow. Our other two diners both received the Pescado Veracruzano which is pan seared sustainable seasonal fish *tomato * kalamata olive *jalapeno * oregano * white wine garlic broth. They were both thrilled as the Olives were not overpowering and it's more of a soup. This dish's secret weapon is that it's made with a slew of Jalapeno peppers, so if you don't like heat, request without. Our party loves the fire, so the more the merrier. We finished with the \"Tres Leches\" and the \"Banana Cream Pie\". Tres Leches (three milk) was super sweet and a great touch to finish the meal. I would recommend ordering a strong espresso to go with this. Overall, can't wait to go back. One of the best dining experiences in a long time and with food and service like this, a True pleasure and tip of the hat to Chef Susan and Chef Mary Sue.  Visited March 2013",

If the weather is nice, I would recommend sitting on the patio. It has a really nice view of the Mandalay Bay Pool, and it's well shaded with fans.  The restaurant starts you off with a nice salsa trio, each of which has a nice, distinct flavor. The carne asada quesadillas are really good - the beef has a great flavor, and are nicely crisped without being greasy. The guacamole is simple but fresh and tasty. The pepper crusted steak salad is really good. The steak is cooked really well, and the salad is a nice bed of fresh greens with avocados and blue cheese. So good!  I would definitely go back!",

Ceviches, uh no, just say poached fish with lemon juice. They said the chef is from Mesa grill, well now I know what Gordon Ramsey was talking about.   As for the service and the restaurants standards? Water glasses were all spotty, silverware was spotty as well. Edges of the resturant was very dusty, debris on the floor, dirty tables, and as i was sat down the busser nor servera ever wiped the seat from the prior table. I seen my busser more than I did my server who may I add was either talking to Co workers at the bar or elevator. I guess the idea is to come to work and watch sports and chill out, thinking we will some tip. Better service at a local pub. What is the direction of this place to discourage people from coming in hope to send them to the new location?   I have been here a few times from past to present and I understand every restaurant has its quirks, even the one I work at.  But brunch has always been great, an affordable dinner before a show or event was alway good for a mexican restaurant.  We have been back for both and since the change of a chef and what looks like to be managers this place is not worthy of a honorable mention from Al in his reviews. I know he has a soft spot for the owners, but I think he really needs to revisit.  Or maybe it just too much tequila shots while he is here. Lol.",

And it was.  I had the shrimp and chorizo taquitos, which were tasty but a little schizophrenic. The shrimp and chorizo was an odd (but good) combination, even if neither are particularly strong, but the three taquitos were served \"glued\" to the plate by some good tangy guac...topped with a sweet lobster cream sauce...and then with a vinegar dressed cabbage salad with roasted corn. Lots of stuff going on here, and all of it is good, but it's a lot of fighting flavors. Not that I didn't eat all of it, mind you. That wasn't a problem.  I will say their outdoor patio is nice - I was there on a very nice day, and it was really pleasant to sit outside, look out over the pool, and watch nearly tame finches dart amongst the tables, swooping in to grab the tortilla chips I kept tossing on the ground, and anything people left behind at the table for anything more than a microsecond. I found myself very contented. If I was back, and I was close, I would probably go back for a nothing special type of meal when I want up for anything requiring more effort. But I don't know if it'd make a journey for it, especially considering everything else I've eaten this week.",

The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing, the staff was friendly, attentive and helpful, and the food was just plain amazing. We started with the traditional chips and salsa, which at Border Grill, is actually a sampler of three varieties of salsa.  All were fresh and delicious, but my favorite was to green tomatillo salsa.  It was bright and tangy with a great spicy kick. I order the brisket taquitos and my husband had the Yucutan pork. My taquitos were perfect-crispy without being greasy, full of delicious, flavorful beef and topped with just the right quantity of shredded lettuce, salsa, guacamole and sour cream.  The presentation was colorful and beautiful arranged with black beans flanked by petite portions of fabulous arroz verde and red spanish rice.  My husband's choice of the Yucatan pork, which he chose based on the server's recommendation, was also beautiful and delicious (of course I tried a bite!). The pork was tender, moist with a fascinating, complicated flavor that included orange and cinnamon. Served with plantains, rice and fresh corn tortillas, it was a meal to be remembered.  If I ever find myself in Las Vegas again I will definitely plan to visit Border Grill again!",

I rather have Campbells soup than your Tortilla Soup.  It must have came from a can!  Chips w/ Guacamole-  mmm-Good!  The Chips are complimentary and you have to pay for the Guac, but it's totally worth it! However, if you do not favor chucks of white onion; I must advice you to stay away.

Their chips are gluten free, and have a dedicated fryer for them. The chips were phenomenal and addictive! They give you 3 salsas.  I loved the green sauce. We ordered guacamole, and it was very fresh. Ask for lime to squeeze on the chips and guac. We ordered the Baja ceviche, which had a jalapeno aioli. That was not so good. The fish didn't seem fresh.  I chose the gluten free chicken enchiladas and split it with a friend. Delicious and citrusy. Had some margaritas and i felt like there was no alcohol in them, but they were tasted good.  Would probably save my money there! Go to happy hour at Hussong's Cantina nearby in the hotel for a good margarita that is properly tequila'd!",

It took several minutes to get water, which was okay because it was a busy Saturday night but once we finished our water we never got refills despite asking our waiter several times for more water.    The carne asada quesadilla was okay, the meat was delicious and tender but the Tortilla was greasy. We only had one small basket of chips, our waiter did not even offer us more chips.   Before we ordered, we stated we would need two separate checks because 5 out of the 7 people I was with needed to expense their meal together but when we received out checks 3 people were together and everyone else had separate checks. It was apparent our waiter either forgot or was not listening to us.   I gave 3 stars primarily for the Raspberry chipotle Margarita, it was delicious.",

    "text": "I regret not visiting the LA Border Grills when I lived there because I'd be there weekly. After the previous night's disappointment at Fleur we decided to try something a smidge more casual and Border Grill ended up being our first choice. Why is it great where Fleur failed?   1) The food is actually cooked well and didn't confuse salt and fat with flavor. Seasoning on everything was perfect from the chips through to the desserts. The food all had nuance, even the steak which is usually one of the more boring things on the menu was seasoned spectacularly well. The accompanying quesadilla would have been a great appetizer in its own right. I don't think it's possible to go wrong on this menu.  2) The service gives a shit. Our server was awesome, he steered us in the right direction on recommendations, telling us what he wouldn't order, and why, and making sure that everything was there when we needed it. At one point we needed a spare steak knife and didn't need to flag someone down, it just appeared as if by magic. Everyone we interacted with was awesome, and they got the pacing perfect. We never waited for anything but we also never felt rushed.  3) Casual is, well, casual. Border Grill manages to do a bit upscale without being stuffy. This is just an easy restaurant to be in. The energy is great throughout and the patio is a great place to be, overlooking the pool at the Mandalay Bay and it was even comfortable in the beginning of summer. Nothing is forced.  4) The drinks are great. There's a bunch of different spins on Margaritas on the menu and they're all worth drinking and all perfect for summer. Order anything from the cocktail menu with confidence. It's all great.  Some restaurants have great food but the service is off, or they have great service but the food leaves something to be desired. Or there's great food and service, but the bar is weak. Border Grill is one of the few restaurants that hits on all cylinders.",

    "text": "Our reservation for valentine's day dinner at Border Grill wasn't perfect, but nothing that would take away from the 5 star rating.   We ordered the guacamole and tuna ceviche appetizers, both fresh and beautifully presented. Asked ahead of time for the guacamole to be SPICY (more jalapenos than normal) and it came out bland. Salsas for the table were good, especially the tomatillo salsa.   I ordered the chicken chile verde enchiladas and my honey had the Yucatan pork. Both of us thought our dishes were wonderful, generous portions and almost too gorgeous to eat. Love a restaurant that ensures the freshest and organic ingredients. Handmade tortillas really made the enchilada dish. We were wow'ed. For dessert we had the Mexican chocolate pie, which was just like regular chocolate pie, couldn't taste the Mexican chocolate, but it was good.   The only issue I had here was that I was sitting directly under a water leak (air conditioning, maybe?) and got dripped on here & there throughout the meal. Didn't want to ruin my dress! Told the waitress about it, she was non-chalant about it. Weird.   Anyway: dinner here was a pleasure. Being local, we will be back again. We just won't sit in the leaky dining room!",

    "text": "\"Death by All You Can Order Brunch\"  On our search for a good Sunday brunch on the Las Vegas strip, my husband and I came across Border Grill on Yelp.  We have been to Border Grill in Santa Monica for happy hour, and really enjoyed the tacos we ate there, but when we saw the brunch menu here, we were sold.  You see, my husband is a huge fan of anything \"all you can eat\", but I don't love buffets because the food is often mediocre and the thought of people digging through the same food kind of skeeves me out.  Border Grill serves an \"all you can eat\" brunch for $34.99 per person, but you actually order small plates off a menu.  The best of both worlds for us, especially when for an additional $8, you can add bottomless mimosas!  We made a reservation via Open Table for 11am, and were sat at a great table on the patio overlooking the pool area at Mandalay Bay.  We started off ordering 2 dishes each, and subsequently 1 dish each thereafter.  We never felt rushed by our server, which was a pleasant surprise.  Before our first dishes came, we were brought some delicious flaky empanadas, and the best corn tamales I've ever had (not being a fan of tamales, this was a great surprise)!  The mimosas were great, generous on the champagne, and there were many flavors to sample.  We had the typical orange juice mimosas, as well as peach, pomegranate, and my favorite, cucumber lemon.  Here is a list of the items we sampled, in the order we ate them, and our assessment:  Breakfast Enchilada- good, but the corn tortilla was hard to cut Shrimp and Grits- DELICIOUS, shrimp were cooked perfectly Skirt Steak and Eggs- best thing on the menu.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and well seasoned Short Rib Hash and Egg- average  Crispy Potato Rajas Taco- crispy and yummy Biscuits and Sausage Gravy- gravy was delish but 1 biscuit would have been plenty  Breakfast Fries- smothered french fries, so delicious and bad for you, in a good way Bacon Jalapeno PBJ- a unique blending of flavors, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would  Lobster Pancake- I enjoyed this, my husband did not like Waffle with Pork Belly and Syrup- a wonderful blend of sweet and savory  Skirt Steak and Eggs- SO GOOD WE ORDERED IT AGAIN BUT CAN'T FINISH IT Bread Pudding French Toast- decadent and delicious, but I'm starting to feel like there's a brick in my stomach  Churro Tots- oh dear God we ordered too much and I feel like I might die  The food was so delicious we could not stop eating until we literally felt like we were going to explode.  It was all so amazing and delicious.  I don't regret our gluttonous brunch whatsoever because the food was just that yummy.  Suffice it to say we wobbled back to our hotel, took a food/champagne nap, and didn't eat much of anything for the rest of the day.  It was so worth it, and I can't wait to go back to Border Grill for brunch so I can experience Death by All You Can Order Brunch once again.",

The service was very friendly and helpful. He gibe us the advise to try the plates dinner as we asked several questions about the meals. Its a all you can eat deal annd so then you cannorder diffrent meals. Wagyu beef tacos, and steaks have been delicious! All the plates come in a smaller size so you canntry several plates. We had around 6-8 each.   We also liked the place here. Nice decoration, style and overal look. It was a bit crowdy bit thats normal for such a good place at around 8 pm.   Definetly can highly recommend this spot when you like mexican food. Very friendly and fast service, amazing meals and choice and nice atmosphere!!",

    "text": "Yummy, great change of pace from your normal AYCE brunches in Vegas. I came here this past weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday, and they set us up in a private dining room for our 40+ person party.    Must Get: Green Corn Tamale Plantain Empanada Peruvian Shrimp and Grits - A fav amongst my friends Skirt Steak and Egg - Top dish here! Breakfast Fries - Reminscent of lomo saltado Fig and Blue Cheese Quesadilla Green Eggs and Ham Waffle and Pork Belly -Generous pork belly portion  Ok: Machacha Chilaqueles Biscuit and Sausage Gravy Lobster Pancakes - The lobster was really just a tablespoon of shredded lobster  Skip: Churro Tots Breakfast Enchilada - The tortilla on the bottom was hard Sweet Potato Pancake - The syrup was too thick! I would imagine the pancake by itself is good. I would definitely ask for the syrup on the side next time Yucatan Egg Benedict - The bread absorbed the egg flavor too much, imo.  Unfortunately, for a party this big, they charged as all for the unlimited mimosas, although a good number of us did not have mimosas. We made sure they took away our glasses for people who didn't drink, but one of the waiters even said \"I don't believe that you're not drinking\". I thought she was joking when she said that, but I guess it was True because when the bill came, they charged us all for mimosas. Kind of upsetting, because at the very end, people had already left cash for the bill and left, and the birthday boy ended up eating the rest of the bill. The service for the mimosas was great though, they basically left bottles of champagne on the table for us and brought new ones when we ran out.  Overall, the food here was really good and a lot of these dishes had a generous portion of scrambled eggs.  For the sweets dishes, they were all a little too sweet though. Service was good, they kept coming out with food and they were even nice enough to give us just steak when we asked.",

    "text": "After a morning at the Mandalay Bay Beach, my boys were famished and we needed something quick to eat so we headed here. They gave us chips with three different types of salsas and a free corn tamale to hold them over for the main entree. The corn tamale appetizer with salsa and sour cream dip was a mix of sweet and savory. I liked it and my sons liked it too despite the hesitation to try it at first for its very mushy appearance and texture.  It didn't take long before my boys orders of carne asada and chicken quesadillas were placed on our table. My eldest said their quesadilla was a tie to mine if it was an actual contest, so that's quite a compliment (for them) considering he wants to eat my homemade quesadilla everyday (ask me for my recipe, if you like). The seasonal fish available was mahi mahi so I had to try their fish tacos (Ensenada tacos) and it was recommended by the waitress. It was served on corn tortilla filled with mahi mahi, avocados, cilantro, shredded green papaya and grapefruit (saved the best for last). Now I don't usually like grapefruit in any form, but it added a citrus punch to this taco that was quite good. It also had a right spicy taste too. I didn't  like their cilantro and plain rice as I found it too dry and not so tasty. Service was great- very attentive, always kept filling my empty glass of water, and warm. I may come again just to try their brunch since others are raving about it (weekends and it starts at 10 am).",

We started with guacamole and cc hios. Guacamole was flat and needed more lime, salt, and probably some cilantro too. We ordered lunch specials on recommendation of waitress. Less than stellar short rib enchiladas.  Mine needed salt which is not on the table.  I thought it was me. But son in law agreed his was a little flat and needed seasoning too. Daughter #1 ordered a chicken quesadilla which needed seasoning as well. Pulled pork mini tacos  were good according to daughter #2, not great, but good. Ok food but not what I  expected and the lunch bill with no drinks was $140. Don't think lunch was worth the price. .",

Now I can save you some time by telling you my entire group tried everything on the brunch menu, and I can save you time and money by telling you everything was average at best. The pancakes were dry and flavorless, the Yucatan Egg Benedict was boring and heavy, the Huevos Rancheros was okay but nothing special, the biscuit and sausages gravy was...again flavorless.   If you're staying at the Mandalay Bay, you might as well go here because it's close. If you're staying anywhere else, it's not worth the trip.",

The flavors were delicious, especially the chilaquiles and chile relleno. Most of the dishes we ordered were a bit spicy, especially the cauliflower taquito. I'd certainly recommend this to friends, and am likely to return on my next visit to Las Vegas.",

I tried the shrimp BLT which was my favorite, the chilaquiles which was a close second, the crane asada tacos. The carne asada was tender and flavorful, an excellent choice. I di dorder the breakfast enchilada but it wasn't my favorite so I passed it a long. A teensy bit too spicy for my palate. I wrapped up my meal with the fruit plate, and it was divine.  Oh, and the best part? The bloody mary with BACON infused vodka. Do yourself a favor, order it. It will leave you craving another a week later when you're not even in Vegas anymore.  Our server Tom was as good as it gets and a breath of fresh air after some of the experiences I had in Vegas. Hes a delight, the food was amazing, and it was walking distance from my hotel room which made it well worth everything.",

    "text": "Meal #8 of 2017 Las Vegas Trip   This was easily my husband's and my favorite meal in Las Vegas. It was such a lovely relaxing experience from start to finish. And everything was so yummy I gorged myself attempting to try as many different dishes that I could (and also revisiting some of the best ones).   The weekday lunch does not compare in the slightest to the weekend brunch, which while good, is in a completely different Stratosphere. (Let's see how many other Vegas hotels I can reference in this review, or on second thought, maybe not.)    The sunny two story Mandalay Bay restaurant definitely is superior to the other windowless location in the echo-y mall at Caesars Palace. The fact that Mandalay Bay's patio had a view of the pool just hammered the final nail in the coffin.   A tapas-size version of each dish arrived, made to order, often in its own miniature frying pan. The cold items were available at a station by the bar. This included a made-to-order salad (the chef plucked still-growing micro greens to make it) which was one of the highlights of both our meals. Also here was a chia blueberry parfait (chia seed, lemon zest, almond coconut milk, and fresh blueberries). I may have had more than one.   Highlights from the rest of the menu included the barbeque brisket mini torta and the chilaquiles. (Unfortunately I waited too long to write this review because I'm having trouble remembering what we liked and the few things we didn't like as much. I do remember the husband loving the salad and the chilaquiles.)   Our server (I can't remember her name but I know she was from Sonora) was super friendly. I appreciated that she offered to bring a cinnamon roll pancake from the buffet menu to the kids (who were eating lunch off the kids' menu - they weren't complete freeloaders). The servers were nice and generally looked the other way when we did share a little of our food with the kids.   For $38.99 a person, totally worth it.     Our Las Vegas 2017 Trip   5 Stars BORDER GRILL, MANDALAY BAY (brunch) Grimaldi's, The Palazzo Bouchon Bakery, The Venetian (snack) Eggslut, Cosmopolitan (snack)   4 Stars Payard, Caesars Palace Border Grill, Caesars Palace (lunch) Shake Shack, New York New York   3 Stars  Tournament of Kings, Excalibur Bruxie, New York New York Therapy, Downtown",

We sat on the gorgeous patio and had the most amazing server. Cannot for the life of me remember his name (thanks to bottomless mimosas) but he has tattoos and apparently just started there recently.  We opted for the $40 all you can eat tapas and $15 all you can drink mimosas. We started out with the mango mimosa. Amazing!  Food wise you truly couldnt get better. We had the shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, and fries dish. All were outstanding. We loved the shrimp and grits/ steak and eggs so much we ended up ordering them again. All the dishes are tapas so you get to try so many different things! We love that.  The next round of food was soooo good. we had some type of sweet tamale. OMG if i wasn't so full we could have ordered 3 more. We also had the chocolate chip cookies with ice cream for dessert.   We also had a few rounds of the passion fruit mimosas and those were by far our favorite. If you're going to come here for Sunday brunch make sure you have a reservation. it was PACKED! We cannot wait to come back.",

    "text": "I came here last Saturday for brunch with my husband and MIL to celebrate my birthday, and I was SUPER excited about it! I have dined here many times, just never for brunch and the food and service have always been fantastic. This visit was a COMPLETELY different story.  We sat down on the patio since it was a beautiful day and I love the relaxing environment of the outdoors during brunch.  Our server came to our table, his name was Ellis (I could be spelling this wrong.)  Right off the bat, he was straight up RUDE.  He seemed very annoyed at the fact that he was at work, or was extremely hungover. We walked up to the table and we ended up greeting him before he greeted us, because he just looked at us and gave us a look like \"the fuck do you people want?\"  It was kinda strange but we tried to brush it off.  He then said \"so it's somebodys birthday here?\" then pointed at my MIL.  She laughed and said \"no, it's hers!\" and pointed to me.  He rolled his eyes and said \"great.\"  And walked away.  I couldn't tell at this point if he thought he was being funny or ironic as the \"asshole waiter\" but it was getting old fast.  Then when it came to ordering, we said we would start off to share 4 different plates.  He obviously was not listening because he brought out 4 of EACH plate. That was fine, no biggie.  As for drinks we all opted for the unlimited mimosas as we were celebrating.  Literally took 20 minutes per drink. I'm sorry, but if you're paying 20 dollars for cheap champagne should keep it flowing.  Every time we tried to flag our server down while he was standing there doing nothing to ask for another he would condescendingly say \"yeah, they're coming, I promise.\" Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had to cook a damn mimosa.    Let me end by saying that my husband is currently a server, and I am a former server.  Throughout the meal, we were nothing but extremely nice to this server, hoping he would realize \"hey, we're actually good patrons!\" and would start to be kinder to us or give us better service. This was not the case.  Every time he came to our table (which was far and verrrrry few between....the bussers and expos were at our table far more than this  jackass) he rolled his eyes at every tiny request, never smiled, and treated us honestly like the scum of the fucking earth.  It took everything I had to not complain to management right then and there, but I REALLY did not want to waste another minute ruining my birthday and just wanted to move on from it that day.  So here I am, because fuck that if somebody treats a well paying customer like a piece of shit for no reason other than you're in a bad mood.  Also, in a lovely ending gesture, he slammed our check on the table at the end without even turning to me said \"happy birthday.\"  As for the food, it was pretty decent. But the entirety of the experience was ruined by the terrible service.",

Fish taco was highly recommended by the waiter but it was soggy and not flavorful.  Bloody Mary was surprisingly watery. It tasted like diluted tomato juice. Really missed a strong tang of tomato.  Complimentary chips and salsa probably were the best part of the meal.",

They offer bottomless mimosas for only $10 if you purchase the $34.99 bottomless brunch, but it even gets better then that. They offer 7 different flavors ranging from blood orange to watermelon to pomegranate. All very good!   We made a reservation through open table since I figured it'd probably be a bit busy. We came around 11 am and were quickly seated. Our server was super friendly and explained the lunch vs brunch menus to us. She also let me know we'd be getting 15% off our bill for being locals. Gotta love the local love!  Food wise I loved some of the dishes but thought the others were just meh. I ended up getting the huevos rancheros, tomatillo egg benedict, chilaquiles and the tres leches french toast. I did enjoy that they're small plates so you're able to order multiple dishes to try without getting too stuffed. My favorites were the chilaquiles and huevos rancheros, both were very unique and flavorful. The benefict I personally didn't care for and felt it was kinda bland. Same with the french toast, just ok.   I'm excited to come back here again soon and try some more of the dishes!",

    "text": "DIRTY AND OVERPRICED  If they could be upfront about the pricing and not be discussing in their bathrooms this review never would've happened.  It's called setting the expectation.   Oh my god is this place is overpriced I mean  geez Louise I had a Cadillac margarita it was $34 Doesn't that seem like a little too much.   As you can see from the picture it says $14.  There's nothing on the menu that stipulates that it's going to be that muck more.    As you can see from the picture my kids had kids meals my wife had a gin and tonic and my wife had a ceviche and it came to $106.  I ate  nothing  I rarely complain about the price but when I go for a snack and I get charged $106 Ive got a wonder why.    In addition while I was in the bathroom at the shark encounter I saw that custodian clean 3 urinals and 3 toilets with a rag that he then proceeded to use same rag on the counters for the sinks( see attached picture )  I complained to the manager, Darla,and she handled it poorly by being a unconcerned and giving me a six dollar discount hence  the one star review will remain at one  Oh on a note darla confessed to me that is customary in vegas to charge 2 1/2 times the regular price of a cocktail if you asked for a decent size glass and a double instead of a mini  glass or whatever they intended to serve it in.    Granted this is a massive double margarita fueled review and I feel bad about stiffing the waitress on her tip but I was pretty pissed about $106 bill for a snack and a cocktail.  And I also feel bad that my solitary review took them from four and a half stars to four stars.  But you have to take a yelpers seriously.     I'm gonna go lay down now.",

However, majority of their menu is gluten free.   It feels and tastes more like your average chain restaurant than a premium topchef restaurant.

That is just one of the benefits, the food has always been great but tonight we had a tasting menu and we were very impressed. I had the Fillet and my wife had the scallops as the main course, but the appetizer and deserts were just as amazing.  The price is very fair - locals ask about the VIP discount plan.

Attending conventions at the Convention Center in Mandalay Bay, I usually scurried by this restaurant and didn't stop to take too much notice.  The only thing I did notice was that it was always busy (good sign?).  Amber K. suggested we try it out as it has good reviews on Yelp and since we were in the area, I said 'why not?'  We walked up and were quickly seated and attended to promptly by our waiter Lars for the remainder of the night.  I decided to try the soft shell crab tostada appetizer and roll with the grilled mahi mahi tacos for my main entree.  The food was very nice and Lars also hooked it up with some habanero salsa for our chips in between each course of the meal.  We finished off the night with a \"Mexican\" banana split which consisted of mexican chocolate, pineapple, and raspberry ice cream topped off with a little bit of coconut.  Overall, the food was delish and I left sastified.  Also, just being locals, Lars signed us up for the Border Grill VIP card which gave \"VIP\" locals like myself 15% off of the bill every time we rolled into Border for anything outside of happy hour.  Good night?  I think so.  Will be back soon to try one of the many other options available at the Border Grill!",

    "text": "We made Valentine reservation arrangements weeks before through the Mandalay Bay resort (on site).  Our party of 5 was originally seated inside a loud, unimpressive part of the restaurant. They were kind enough to honor our request to be seated outside (which we said we would gladly wait for) only to be placed in a back corner facing construction drapes and pvc fencing.  Our server was very polite but told us (after getting to know him) they were understaffed due to several call-ins. We chose the \"family style\" service where our server brought out several plates for our party to work on.  Every single one of them was cold, luke-warm at best!  You could tell they were flavorable, but all was lost on the cool temp.  One example was the cauliflower taquitos, raved about by other guests, which were stone cold in their center.  We brought  it to our server's attention to which he apologized and said he would tell the chef.  Frankly our mimosa glasses went empty often as we must have been forgotten sitting in the construction zone.  However, we powered on and tried other items on the menu at our server's urging.  Alas the food arrived (cold again) and the frustration continued.  The server informed the manager (not at our request) who apologized profusely and credited our bill 20% and several of the champagne extra charges (which we made certain to get plenty of, sampling all the different mimosa blends on the menu.)  So, unfortunately I cannot recommend Border Grill based on our experience. I would be reluctant to return as there are many other alternatives for Sunday Brunch in Vegas.",

Our server Mike was fantastic knowledgeable about the menu and knew intuitively what would tickle our fancy. Also very personable and funny! A treat to interact with! He made my young daughter feel at home and engaged her in banter and recommended the Ceviche Trio for her. SHE adored it, for a child she is very adventurous when it come to food.

    "text": "Still some issues at the front of the house. My friend and I came in with reservations at 9 pm and were seated promptly. The runner came out with water and chips, and that concluded the timely part of the service. We sat there for fifteen minutes and filled up on a whole lotta chips. We ordered the guacamole which was good, I personally prefer less lime in my sauce but I can see how somebody would like more. After discussing the menu items, evaluation of the probability of a downgrade of U.S. debt, outlining all of the eventualities of a default, and analysis of the political barriers towards a deal, the server took our drink orders. Her claim was that she had two sections to cover because somebody was out for the night. I am a little skeptical since there were several servers working and a management call to simply give one person two sections seems unreasonable.   The food, however, was outstanding like the last time I was here. The server upsold me on the tuna tartare on chips as an appetizer; delicious, but the tuna ought to be cut into fine pieces - I had to take the tuna down in one hefty bite. My other complaint is that $14 for two loaded chips is comparable to my earlier experience at T&T, needless to say, not the best deal. I had the short ribs as an entree, it was mixed in a smoky and sweet cayenne sauce over a bed of corn polenta, I definitely didn't leave hungry nor unsatisfied. I also tried my friend's quesadilla, the blue cheese and mushrooms are a nice twist on a staple dish. The tres leches cake was decent, not too interesting, but alright if you need to finish on a sweet note.",

While we were waiting to be seated a woman already eating said,  \"this is the worst Mexican food I've ever had.\" Considering the location and reputation of the chef I thought that was a little overly dramatic and possibly overstated but it still made me concerned.   Anyway the menu was full of standards--quesadillas and taco options--but I wanted to have something that required enough effort that the chef couldn't just mindlessly throw it together so I chose the Yucatan Pork. It was a business lunch so I was concerned that the portion would be a little much but I went for it and so did the gentleman seated next to me (a former bball player built like a lineman, so my portion question remained).  The pork was tender, fall apart, melt in your mouth good and season perfectly. The mountain of pork was more than enough and so distracting that the tasteless tortilla accompaniment was unnecessary and unmissed.  A side of sweet plantains with a bit of crunch was excellent!  I considered taking my table mates portion since they weren't of interest to him but kept some form of etiquette and decorum.  I'm not sure what the concoction was but the black bean paste on the side was another great edition with the cheese and rice. Ignore the mile long trek through the restaurant to be seated outside on a freezing Vegas afternoon, and the young \"too busy for you\" waitstaff and I would go back specifically for this dish!",

The restaurant is private, with almost no public view of the casino, windows make up the whole wall, letting the natural sunlight in without the harsh desert heat. That is five star worthy already!  The staff are very nice and patient with complete knowledge over the contents of the menu. The food is supreme. They have the best Enchiladas I have ever had. I used to live in Chicago so I know. Not greasy at all and fluffy af. The dessert is great, from rich flan to cookies stuffed with liquid chocolate, it will leave you wanting more.   If you are in Las Vegas stop in for brunch or dinner, it's all good!",

You really have to sift around, but there are some very solid places in Vegas and in the casinos, places that leave little to chance. This is one of them. Service was impeccable, the chips and sauces were pretty well thought out and seemingly endless and the food itself, aside from the rice side (blech) was also very, very good. I wouldn't put it quite to great and it took me awhile to decide because most of the dishes needed modification so I could have them. This place is also exceedingly slow, so it should be avoided if you're in any kind of hurry, but this is definitely one of the better Mexican-style places I've hit up in Vegas and they definitely do what they can to take care of you...call it more a 4.5.",

I recommend this restaurant to anybody visiting the Las Vegas area to please come out.

We enjoyed Plantain Empanadas as an appetizer, perfect size for 2-4 people. My friend devoured the Brisket Taquitos, and practically licked the plate clean. Another friend ordered the Chicken Tacos, which she enjoyed, but the tortilla was too small for the amount of filling, so she had to finish it with a fork. I had the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas and they were awesome!! Our server was slow, and didn't check in on us after we got our meals so we didn't get to order a second round of drinks. The food runners were very helpful, however, bringing us appetizer plates and refilling our chips. The prices were very affordable, especially for Vegas. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Border Grill.",

I ordered the brunch all you can eat small plates... it was more than I remember it being. I checked the LA location for pricing and theirs is $30 which is $13 cheaper than the Vegas location. Also, they changed their menu which is expected but its mostly seafood which I don't eat. I still decided to try it for the other plate options. Service was insanely slow. I put in a request for 3 plates at a time and still they came out one by one and i was only getting one small plate every 40min. It ended up being a 3.5 hour lunch due to slow service and the food was watery and not packed with flavor. What happened here???",

As you can see from my pictures, we ended up with an awesome array of goodies. The cheddar biscuit eggs Benedict was up there for me. Their version of a hollandaise was divine and the accompaniments were perfect pairings. The strawberry compote on the chicken and waffle made that dish a star. The bread pudding was good but when you had Gordon Ramsay's bread pudding TWICE the night before it can't compare. The steak with the steak and eggs dish was cooked a perfect mid-rare and had wonderful seasonings.   Everything was very delicious. The pricing was more than fair with the quality of food and amount you got. Chips and salsa was provided in the meantime but the food didn't take long to come out and our server paced us nicely. We will be back FOR SURE.",

Our waiter told us he had an order of how the dishes should be served, so he would bring them out in rounds of 2 or 3, and we didn't end up ordering anything specific. If your waiter does that, remember any dishes you wanted to try, because at least in our case he didn't bring every single item from the menu out.   From the brunch options, my favorites were the steak & egg, chicken & waffle, and churro tots. If you try to eat every single item like we did, you will most likely get too full to re-order anything.   If you're looking for a tasting-menu type meal in Las Vegas from celebrity chefs, this brunch option is definitely one of the most affordable ones I've seen on the strip!   They also don't require the whole table to order the unlimited brunch, which is really nice since not everyone in your group may want to drop the $40.",

We ordered almost everything on the brunch small plate menu and nothing disappointed!!  Definitely worth the price, this place is a must try!",

The green chili tamales were good although a bit undercooked and the chips with various salsa accompaniments were all fairly flavorful. I wasn't blown away by the food but the overall experience would push me to return should I find myself at the Mandalay Bay again mid-day.",

In my opinion, you're better off hogging as many free chips as you can (the three salsas were well liked by everyone) and ordering a salad. That formula should get you full enough while being budget friendly. The salad I got was the Watercross, Avocado and Orange salad. It was delicious once I got rid of the avocado. It came with three bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese that created a flavor fiesta in my mouth. We had a nice outdoor table on a patio that overlooked the impressive Mandalay Bay pool. The restaurant is tucked in the very back of Mandalay Bay like it's some kind of ugly duckling.",

The restaurant is really pretty inside and reminds me a bit of Frontera Grill in Chicago. We went for lunch and I had guac as an appetizer which was very, very good. The three salsas and chips were great too. My husband had steak tacos and enjoyed them and I had the chicken chiquilles which were good but had too many chip and not enough chicken. My red and green rice was very good too. Now as far as deserts go, we had the two half slice desert. We choose the Mexican chocolate cake which I wouldn't pick again and the banana cream pie which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Our server was good and I would definitely go back and try something else.",

Upscale but not at all pretentious or \"Vegas-y.\"  The menu offers plenty of options whether you prefer red meat, chicken, seafood, or veggies.

This was a great value, as the apps and dessert were plenty to share with a few people.  The Green Chicken Poblano Enchiladas were great, even though I ended up mostly eating the chicken inside because I was saving room for the tres leches cake.  Yum!!",

Ladies took their time to get me a menu despite the fact there was only one couple at the bar - no big deal. Its the subtle snobs that really got to me - two other dudes show up and happen to sit on either side of where I was. I've been here close to 5 minutes now but not sure what I want to order, but its a Mexican restaurant so chips and salsa is expected, turns out not for me. I only got chips AFTER I placed my order. But the other two dudes get their chips with their menus within seconds. At which point I still want to take it as an oversight. My biggest issue is when the two ladies at the bar proceed to check on the two guys every so often but NOT ONCE did they ask if I was ok or needed anything. Suffice if you've stayed at Mandalay you do know about their souvenir alcohol cups from the beach so I guess showing up with one gave the \"no tip impression!\" I always divide my tab by 5 so still left a 20% tip, despite all this, but my main issue is I hope I didn't get this treatment because I was a black guy with dreads!! Stayed here often but just never visited Border Grill but now I know not to go back. One hell of a first time it was!!",

We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was nice. It was dark but intimate and quiet. Our waiter was not the friendliest guy but he did let us know about the drink menu and the special of the night. I feel like when he found out that we were going to only get an appetizer and one entree (two of us) his attitude got even worse.  We started with the raja potato tacos appetizer which was amazing (there are only two tacos as an appetizer so not really enough to share.) They were different than any other type of taco I have had and really a flavor explosion. I'm not sure how to explain the texture of the potato but it was almost like a mashed potato that had been fried on a hard fried tortilla with chipotle crema. It also came with guacamole and a corn salsa. I would definitely order these many times again. In fact I think I will be craving these with no way to get them :(  We also had the carne asada quesadilla. It was also delicious. The carne asada was probably the best I have ever had. The meat just melted in your mouth along with the cheese. It was a tad bit on the too salty side but the guac and sour cream countered that a  bit. Overall the flavor was great, just cut down on the salt a bit.  Overall we had a good experience. Our service was just okay. The food was great. I would come back on another visit to Vegas.",

It was delicious and came in a large glass. Yum! Very good for a sweet sangria lover. We also started with guacamole, which was good. Loved the chips here, as they were just salty enough. They bring you 3 kinds of salsa, and our waitress also brought us a very hot version, which my friend enjoyed more than I, as I'm not a spice lover. The guacamole portion was huge!   I ordered the plantain empanadas, and my friend ordered the vegetable quesadilla. We didn't think we'd be able to eat an entree after all those chips and guacamole. Plus the heat had gotten to us and we weren't as hungry as we could've been. Our waitress recommended the empanadas, as I was on the fence about what I wanted. She described them as sweet and salty. The \"dough\" instead of being dough was from plantain, and they were stuffed with black beans, cheese, and poblanos. They were really delicious! My friend enjoyed her quesadilla, which was huge and came with more guac and sour cream, plus pico de gallo.   We ordered a brownie dessert to share, and it was large! It came with ice cream and was rich and delicious.  Our service here was the crowning jewel. Jamie was our server and she rocked! She was personable, gave great service, chatted with us and gave us great recommendations. She was the best server we had in Vegas.   We'd definitely come back (and take a cab next time)!",

On my last day, we had lunch there, also at the bar.  It was happy hour so the drinks were a little less expensive.  I had the spicy shrimp tacos.  Food, drink and service are phenomenal.  Prices are average; not overly pricy, but not cheap.  You are paying for quality in food and service, so just do it.  Go there.  Eat there.",

Come with a big group for the obvious reason that you can share everything. You can literally order anything off the menu. Our server was very personable (told us his crazy Vegas stories) and helpful (he gave us small family style portions so we could try everything). My favorites were the corn tamale, breakfast fries, and steak and eggs. I didn't love the sweet dishes too much (might be just me though). I will admit that after a while everything started tasting similar. I think the running theme of the meal was eggs in every form possible.  A fun Mexican-themed alternative to your average brunch!",

We spend a couple of hours doing this, which is heavily lubricated with endless mimosas that come in a variety of flavors.  We love it.   Some changes this time.  There's a new serve-yourself station that has a few items and where they'll make you a salad.  They seemed to have reworked their recipes a touch with the flavors being sharped some.  The poblano sauces really stood out well this time.  They're always changing their menu, and I was very unhappy to see the biscuits and gravy go.  That was a standard favorite of mine.  They've also reduced the individual serving size which I think is smart.  I can sample more items this way.  And if you want more, you can ask for it.  Plus, if you have a large table, they'll send several servings of a dish on a larger plate so everyone can take as much as they like.",

If they brought it down to $35 or $40 I'd be more into it but spending $60+ dollars each after (if you get a drink) seems really ridiculous for Sunday brunch.",

First, they give you a huge basket of crispy tasty tortilla chips with three different types of salsa. Perfect with the blanco margarita! I could have been fine on this alone.  I ordered the seasonal vegetable enchiladas, and my husband ordered the fish tacos. Both plates are exceptional. My enchiladas did not look like ordinary enchiladas. Instead, the tortillas were stacked with veggies and cheese between them. It reminded me of Mexican lasagna. I loved the fact that my enchiladas had roasted eggplant, zucchini, and brussell sprouts! My husband's fish tacos were crisp and fresh. He was quite delighted.  All in all, the service was friendly and pleasant. I would go back in a heartbeat!",

They were doing something upstairs so we were lucky enough to have dinner in the downstairs dining room which has 20' high ceilings and a patio outside.  Probably beautiful in the summer but cold this time of year!  We had an EXCELLENT server -- ask for her if you go -- AUTUMN.  Very friendly and efficient.  We were lucky enough to have a great Travelzoo voucher and ended up with far more food than we could eat!!!!  Started with guacamole and baja ceviche.  We eat allot of poke and ceviche and their ceviche was great.  For mains we ordered a scallop shrimp combo over couscous and a yucatan pork.  The scallop shrimp combo was great.  The yucatan pork was cooked really well but we didn't care for the sauce -- it was kind of sweet. We also enjoyed two margaritas on the rocks!  Too full for dessert so we took some almond cake to go!  Lovely restaurant and we really enjoyed our dinner.  Wished we had ordered the skirt steak instead of the yucatan pork but otherwise everything was great.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas for a basketball league he was in. It was our last day and wanted to end our trip with a nice lunch before driving a couple hours home. We had just finished looking through Mandalay Bay`s Shark Reef and were getting hungry. The first place we came across was Border Grill and immediately gravitated towards it when I saw Susan Feninger`s name. Well-known chef for her modern twist on Mexican cuisine and cheftestant on Bravo`s \"Top Chef Masters\" season 1.  Looked at the menu for a bit. Border Grill doesn`t have that many options, so we decided to walk around Mandalay Bay to see if we were interested in anything else. Most of the restaurants in that part of the hotel weren`t open for lunch. We walked as far to Rum Jungle, didn`t want to walk to the other side of the hotel where they had more restaurants, and made our way back to Border Grill.  Border Grill looked to be very busy, even for lunch, the place was packed. As we were taken to our seats, we saw a couple things on people`s tables that intrigued us. The first thing to hit your table are fresh chips and three kinds of salsa. The chips were hot and not at all greasy. We took a glance at the menu and looked for some of those things that we saw on the way in. One was the Steak Nachos. They looked so good, so we knew we had to get an order of that to start. For our entrees, I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Tacos and my boyfriend got the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas.  When the Steak Nachos arrived at our table, I didn`t realize how big it was. I could have had that as my entree and would have been totally fine. Border Grill definitely doesn`t skimp on the toppings. A lot of good small sized pieces of steak, plenty of melty gooey cheese, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, and big dollops of sour cream and guacamole. So amazing! The Spicy Shrimp Tacos we were really good. Chipotle marinated shrimp, cucumber slaw, guacamole, and a chipotle aioli. The tacos also come with rice and refried beans. The Chicken Poblano Enchiladas had smoked chicken, wrapped in corn tortillas, topped with poblano cream and a mix of grilled corn, mushrooms, and poblano chiles. OMG... that poblano cream was the best thing on that dish! So good! I would definitely go back for the poblano cream alone. Everything on the menu should be served with poblano cream. Yummy...",

Border Grill seemed to have the highest reviews and only $$.  Chips and 3 types of salsa: the chips were too salty for our liking, maybe it was just our batch? Guacamole: Amazing! Worth the $9 Plantain empanadas: Comes with 4, very delicious, not as sweet as you'd think, which I loved! Green corn tamales: A must get before your entree! Chicken poblano enchiladas: Just like the chips, they were so salty. Sips of water between bites were needed.  If you plan to watch Michael Jackson One, Border Grill provides a dinner package with show tickets. $42/person for a first, second, third course and dessert and discounted show tickets. My husband and I weren't too hungry so we decided not to take advantage of the package. But I think it's totally worth it!",

I was a little surprised to see the location which is near the convention center food court and slightly tucked away. It was nice that we got to sit out on the patio which overlooks the Mandalay Beach. The salsas were all very good but could've been more flavorful in my opinion. We had the Baja ceviche which was fantastic! I ordered a shrimp and vegetable quesadilla and it was great! Perfectly cooked shrimp with wonderfully marinated vegetables with just the right amount of cheese. The tortillas were deliciously crisp!

Dare I say, the best part of the meal. I got a blanco margarita and it was so bland. It was very obviously a mix that had a distinct flavor. I asked for my margarita to have jalapeno and it came with 2 slices just floating around...lol. So I had to muddle it with my straw best as possible. As for our meal, we used the free check in and got the green corn tamales. They we're pretty good but very sweet. We also got the plantain empanadas which are great! Highly recommend getting those. For our meal, my sister got the octopus which she said was dry and disappointing. The small dish was half potato which seems odd for an octopus dish. Her friend got the fish tacos which she said were great, just difficult to pick up and eat. I got the guacamole, Brussels sprouts, and homemade tortillas. I was planning on making my own little veggie tacos. Brussels sprouts were supposed to have chorizo (yum) but after they came, I was informed that they do in fact not contain chorizo but they decided to not change the menu. It was very odd. The guacamole was really good! Tortillas were awesome but are small street taco size. I felt that $3 for a side of 3 tacos was a bit silly... to overall, this meal was OK. In all honesty, I wouldn't make the trek back down to try again.",

We read that it was the best brunch in Vegas so decided to give it a whirl. We were pleasantly surprised when we found out it was the restaurant of Mary Sue Milliken, chef celeb who we ironically saw in a Cadillac culinary taste challenge in LA a few weeks back. Her food was awesome so I was extremely happy to try her restaurant.   The brunch works like this:  Instead of the bacteria infested all you can eat buffett as most LV joints. Here you have a server who brings you out a tapas portion meal you can share. There are about 17 options and we had 8, sharing everything between 2 people.  OUr goal was to order 1 of everything but just couldn't do it to ourselves. The brunch for $30 per person also includes bottomless mimosas.  NOTE: DO NOT GET THE GUACAMOLE THEY OFFER--ITS A SCRAM TO BUMP UP YOURE ALREADY RICERY BRUNCH. TRUST ME YOU WILL BE SO STUFFED,, DON'T EVEN FILL UP ON THE CHIPS.   Everything was great but a few things did stand out:  -The breakfast enchilada -The eggs benedict -Biscuits and gravy -Asada taco  Left feeling really satisfied and the cost with our 15% discount by signing up for some Border club they offer was a reasonable $55.    LOVE THIS PLACE--just don't get the guac!!!! Oh and sit outside weather permitting, lovely view of the pool.",

We've been thrice since Chef Chris came on board and have yet to be disappointed. We brought a bunch of friends here in March and loved our time. We had some food allergies in our group so we begged not to do family style and were elated when we were given the approval.   Came again in May with family and for the first time, remembered to ask for the Chef's secret brunch item (that wasn't so secret since it was on Facebook). The waitress looked at us like we were insane and said \"we don't have secret items here.\" Then, when shown the picture: \"Oh, we must not be giving those to the public.\" Lady, I'm pretty sure I've seen 4 other tables get the delicious Jalapeno Sorbet. Queue bringing the items out. She explained she just started in April... probably something that should be discussed before sending her out during brunch service.   Hopefully one of these times we will meet chef Chris since we've met Chef Mike several times (gotta get to Truck U!!)",

The foods were both familiar and unique--a sweet corn tamale, chilaquiles with duck confit, plantain empanadas--just enough of a twist to make it stand out without trying too hard.  Everything ran to the spicy side, which was more than fine with me, but be warned if you don't like a little heat.  I balanced it with a cranberry margarita.  For dessert, the pastel Rufalina was an excellent choice, but probably large and rich enough for two or three people.  While the food was great, what really stood out was the customer service.  We received excellent service from start to finish--especially from our server, Jeff.  He knew the menu backward and forward, and made great suggestions without being pushy.  We also got terrific service from the bartender and the hostess.    After a ruined anniversary the night before at Craftsteak, this experience more than made up for it.  I'll be making this a must stop whenever I'm in Vegas.",

We got the all you can eat selection menu with the unlimited mimosa. Hooray! The foods were good selections and best description on each dishes would go to my table service man. He was excellent, not to aggressive on coming back and check on our table. Very funny and friendly guy. I love the service.

Lol Manuel was the server and he was great... Very attentive and made great recommendations. I got the skinny mango margarita and it was really good but not enough mango flavor. The tuna ceviche like appetizer was great as the tuna was really fresh and the flavors popped. The date salad had too much lime for me. The seafood enchiladas were great with a fresh slaw on top, very filling and very good. The steak was fatty but the nachos underneath it were gooey and yummy. The whoopie pie dessert was nice and light but the cake was dry without a lot of chocolate flavor. But the horchata cinnamon milk and the caramel that came with it were fabulous... Could have drank a whole glass and the caramel wasnt heavy so added a nice touch for moistness. Definitely enjoyed the meal and saw some other things on the main menu I want to try!  As a big top chef fan it was nice to try this place. It isn't near the other Mandalay restaurants so it's easier to park near the convention center than the garage and we sat outside because freezing inside but the fan outside did little to keep us cool. The view of the Mandalay pool at night was really a nice touch though.",

The restaurant has both indoor and exterior seating and after being in the smoking, dated Mandalay, I was super happy to enjoy 3 lunches at Border Grill.   As with every Border Grill lunch or dinner, complimentary house made chips and sals are rolled out. We shared the guacamole which is every bit as good as good as the SaMo location. There is a lunch special ahi tacos on the menu which sounded good, but I really wanted a light salad. I asked if they could take the ahi and substitute for the the steak on their normal steak salad. This, with a light vinaigrette made for a very refreshing and light meal.   I love the flexibility! Great service in Vegas!",

Per the waiter's recommendation, I went with the steak tacos, an item not listed on the menu. There were three, they came loaded with guacamole, and they hit the spot.

    "text": "My husband and I recently became Vegans and were stoked to find so many vegan dining options available in Las Vegas. We had an entire dining schedule mapped out for our recent visit which also happened to be our first visit since becoming parents a year and a half ago  Ha!   However, we found that we drank too much and often didn't make it out of our hotel (Bellagio) which was surprisingly lacking many vegan options, so we were really looking forward to visiting Border Grill. We decided to try brunch on Saturday April 14.   When we walked up the hostesses were chatting amongst themselves but finally looked up at us, saying nothing...we finally broke the awkward silence by saying that we would like a table for two. The young lady escorted us to a table and handed us the regular menu at which time I advised that we actually need the vegan menu, she replied saying that she wasn't sure that they were serving it, but she would ask, as we were the second party to request it. WTH? My heart sank, I needed to be fed! Lol And I was soooo looking forward to this! I was almost in a full blown panic by the time she returned with the vegan menu....yay!!!   It was a bumpy start, but let me tell you that was the end of any snafu's. A lovely man, whose name I do not recall, but I believe he was the manager, came over after that and introduced himself; I swear he was like an angel! Lol He answered all of our questions and took such good care of us!!!! We started with guacamole and chips as well as some type of taquito or flauta, I don't recall exactly because it's been a few weeks, but whatever it was, it was amazing! I ordered the \"beef\" enchiladas and my husband had the mushroom tacos and I swear it was one of the best meals we have ever had, vegan or otherwise. Such amazing flavors and textures, everything was spot on, I wouldn't change a thing. When I asked what type of \"beef\" they used, the manager explained that it was The Impossible burger, which we have had before and love, but he went so far as to bring us a little side of it from the kitchen to try. He even researched what it is made from and gave us the 411 on that too. Above and beyond, best service, ever!!!   My husband and I agree that after going vegan, it's not uncommon to have a meal and afterwards say, \" It wasn't bad, for being vegan\". There are definitely times when you feel the pain of your sacrifice (still worth it though). You will not have that experience here, the food and service are amazing, no sacrifice needed! I would drive back to Vegas, from Redondo Beach, just to eat there again. You guys need to open a full vegan restaurant, seriously! We talked about this meal for the rest of our trip and if we hadn't left the next day, we would have gone back for more!   To the folks at Border Grill, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!  Lol",

Go figure I'd start this review with a poem, but all joking aside Border Grill surprised me and really is poetry in motion!  During a recent stay at Mandalay Bay we wound up here with back to back visits for lunch and dinner which pretty much speaks for itself. The wife had been wanting to eat here and I was hesitant because to me it seemed like a healthy alternative to Mexican food I'm used to, but I'm the end I would certainly return for more.  So our first outing was for lunch and we had decided to sit on the patio area which overlooked the pool area so take note should you feel the need to people watch as you eat.   With a Yelp check in they provide you a sampling of the green corn tamale which I did feel was a nice touch. The tomatoes tasted fresh and were pretty crisp and the sour cream was light and creamy, but the sweet corn for me didn't quite knock my socks off as I had hoped. To me it tasted identical to the one from El Torito which was a bummer.   For the main attraction I set my sights on their tacos and of course I went for the \"tres especial\" dabbling in carnitas, spicy shrimp, and carne asada. The carne asada was actually very tender and the marinade complimented the meat very well giving it a little twang bite to bite. I must say the carnitas was a hit as the braised pork was melt in your mouth AND in your hand soft (take that M&M's). Lastly came the shrimp and what I enjoyed was the seasoning of the shrimp as it gave it a slight kick, but nothing too overpowering.  For my dinner outing, since the tacos were all cooked to the nine I figured they knew how to cook their meat very well so I set my sights on the skirt steak. My only thought was being a mariachi band short of a fiesta as I didn't enjoy my experience at all with this one. I had asked for medium rare as I always do and it was extremely rough on the ends of my steak and towards the middle I had about two exceptional bites of tenderness, but it did appear borderline raw which even I won't mess with. I wanted to ask for a replacement yet didn't want to hold up the group so I dealt with it, but that was very disappointing. It's saying a lot if I found the roasted tomato a highlight of the meal!  All in all, I'm delivering a rare three star experience mainly because of inconsistency between lunch and dinner..I feel it was just so-so overall of an experience and I'd be doing a disservice honestly if I said any different..I will be back again as my wife fell in love with border grill after both sittings. I'll cross my fingers in hopes I do the same!",

Even though I could recite the menu by heart by now, it is not a bad place to go. Even after eating there multiple times, I am still giving it 4 stars. The carnitas were surprisingly tender. Guacamole and chips are good. I had an appetizer which was really good, I think it was beef with pineapple salsa? I was pleasantly surprised and wanted more! I would go here again, but am also happy I don't have to for another year",

We were so impressed and satisfied each and every time. From the ambiance to the servers to the delicious food.... it is all outstanding. My husband and I enjoyed this restaurant so much we decided to have our 40 guest wedding reception dinner there this past May. Our favorite server, Brandon, is always on point, even exceeding our dining expectations. The chefs are all amazing in their craft. We have yet to try a menu item that we haven't liked. My husband is a big time meat eater but he even enjoyed trying their vegetarian options too. But the mango sorbet there is heavenly!",

There were plantains that were perfectly sweet, a relish that was perfectly tart, then the amazing pork in a phenomenal salty yet sweet sauce.  It all went together so well!  The waitress was also amazing!  She told us things to do in Vegas and made all the food suggestions we tried.  The view was beautiful.  We ended our meal with a churro dessert that I barely got to taste because my husband devoured it!  It was to die for!  Crispy churros with ice cream and fruit...yummy!

    "text": "A really blow your socks off all you can eat brunch menu. Don't bother looking at the regular lunch menu - that one has pretty standard Mexican fare which may be good but then you'll be missing out on the very unique brunch selection. It's slightly pricey at $42.99 but it is Vegas and it is all you can eat of very refined small plates. The menu has about 16 different dishes so a lot of variety. We ambitiously tried to eat about 13 of them off the menu between 2 people and we just barely made it. I never thought I would be able to eat again but it was so good I kept taking bites.  The brunch has some secret menu items. The chef's secret pancakes that day were a lemon poppy seed with blueberry compote. Really unique with the poppy seeds and pretty complex in flavor - it wasn't like it was just sweet or just pancakes. Another secret slash off menu item were the guava empanadas that were brought over without any prompting. This one was flaky, flavored well and not too sweet.  I'll reiterate that there are a lot of items on this menu and it's amazing at how well executed every single dish was. The Peruvian shrimp and grits featured creamy, luxurious grits with two big shrimps and a punchy aji panca salsa. The short rib hash and egg had amazingly tender short ribs that were melt in your mouth. Another standout was the steak and eggs that again featured a really prime cut of meat that was almost melt in your mouth tender but with great flavors from the chipotle sauce and guacamole. I'm not a huge fan of corn but the green corn tamales were something else. I've never had corn like that before or I would seriously be a fan. The corn was so sweet and unadulterated with anything else it was just eye opening for me. We did have a lot of other dishes that were also great but those were some of the ones that come to mind for me first.  We opted to sit on the patio of the restaurant and I'm not going to lie it was a little warm out there towards the end of August. If you sit closer to the doors though you get some AC when people are walking in and out. The view looks out onto the Mandalay Bay's lazy river, wave pool, and other pool facilities which is a nice backdrop for a meal. The washrooms are located outside of the restaurant, down the stairs by the conference room facilities. I know there are a few Border Grill locations in LA as well so I'll have to check them out but if you're in Vegas, I highly recommend coming for the brunch menu!",

My friend had cheese enchiladas and I had brisket taquitos with a jalapeno slaw rice and tomatillo salsa. It was fresh spicy and delicious.  Jenn took great care of us especially when we had to dash all of a sudden like!   They were backed up with a delay of water chips/salsa and iced tea. Since it's a convention center a little surprised they wouldn't have been prepared but it was minor.   Kev was also the other rockin cool guy workin the bar!   Thanks!

This was my first time trying a tamale and was my favourite item I ate here. It is a corn husk wrapper with mashed sweet corn inside that you eat with salsa and sour cream. It was delicious.  - Yucatan Pork was a huge portion, fried plantains and an orange that you squeeze on top makes the flavor sweet and savory- which was really good.   Cons: - Located in the Mandalay Bay hotel, this place can be a bit hard to find bc it's not in the same row as the food court. Be sure to ask for a map.  - Fish tacos wasn't as good as the other items- it was also hard to eat bc the ingredients were piled very high. The fish also seemed to be grilled instead of the usual fried crispy fish but that's probably healthier.",

The restaurant was busy but there was plenty of bar seating and we were able to order off the full menu there so that's where we set up.   I started with one of their seasonal mojitos, which was refreshing and I'd want to come back later in the year to see what other fruits and combinations they do (the one I had this time was blackberry).  For my appetizer I went with the green corn tamales which are made with sweet corn. This was probably my favorite part of the meal and something I'd go back to again. For my entree I chose the shrimp tacos and with the warm shrimp, cold slaw on top, and crunchy jicama, they were perfect. For restaurant week, we received 3 tacos per entree, which was plenty especially when we also had a dessert coming. I chose the tres leches cake which was ice cold and creamy.   I'm looking forward to coming back again when I have friends staying down near the Mandalay Bay and I want to meet them somewhere for a filling lunch without too high of strip prices.",

The most egregious issue with our dining experience is that 90% of the food was served practically cold from the refrigerator. We were there right when it opened so we could only assume that the food was pulled straight out of the icebox and not given enough time to properly heat.  After 90 minutes I ordered one final diablo fried chicken and it was finally warm so if you want to take your chances on the tapas weekend brunch I recommend coming later versus right when they open at 10am.  The diablo fried chicken and the steak and eggs and ceviche (very small portion) were probably the standouts. The avocado toast was nothing special. The lobster wasn't even detectable in that tapa. We did note that some items were really small while others a larger portion.   The wait to get food was really long so only come here if you have a minimum of 90 minutes. Our server didn't seem to want to be there so that didn't help our dining experience. Definitely won't be returning to this restaurant with just so many better restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "I aways wanted to experience this restaurant because a lot of people have said its amazing, and because I have friends who are Mexican I look for the place to be authentic with their food items, that's very important to me. With that said:  Waitress: Autumn she was very knowledgeable and welcoming. I in no way felt I was being rushed or overly checked on. She was great and provided 5 star service with patience.  Food: short rib enchiladas & churro ice cream sandwich..both were great   Appetizer: cheese with jalapeno and green corn tamale this tamale was my favorite tamale I have tasted with a side of sour cream and pinto de gallo was very light but tasty.  Drink: this is actually a secret drink on the weekdays that I found right up my ally (Autumn recommended it after I couldn't decide what margarita I wanted) It's called Pineapple vinallea bean margarita..Two words: smooth and delicious for a day time cocktail.  Ambiance: I asked to be seated outside on the balcony and it was the best choice, I had views of the lazy river and great lighting which made the vibe more memorable.   Over all I would come back and recommend, thank you Border Grill for my first experience exceeding my expectations.",

We got free corn tamales as a appetizers which was amazing. The salsas and tortilla chips tasted fresh and delicious as well.  We also had Mexican corn dip which was also really good.  For entree my friend and I got one of the specials. A Peruvian dish that consisted of beef tenderloin, peppers, onions, tomatoes and steak fries. The meal came on a sizzling skillet. Flavors were amazing. Prob. One of the best dining experience/food I had in Vegas.  Great last dinner in Vegas for sure!",

    "text": "My friends had been to the Border Grill in LA and they loved it.  So when we were walking through Mandalay Bay and came across Border Grill, we just had to stop in.  It worked out because we were both thirsty and hungry.  Our group was sat immediately, then we were quickly greeted by the most informative, patient, and friendly server.  He answered all our questions and gave us great suggestions.  Starting with their house margarita.  We loved it so much we not only ordered one pitcher, but two.  They make the margarita mix from scratch and it tastes perfect.  It is not too sweet or sour, it is just right.  For dinner he suggested the tacos, but to go further than that he suggested getting a trio of tacos and getting 3 different tacos that they offer.  I of course listened to the professional and again he did not steer me wrong.  I went with the carnitas, spicy shrimp, and fish a la plancha.  They were all delicious.  My favorite was the carnitas, but the other two tacos were so super close behind.  We also grazed on chips, salsa, and fresh made guacamole.  Overall everything was great at Border Grill!  Our server was the best.  He took such great care of us.  The food was amazing and the margaritas were mixed to perfection.  We actually had a good time at Border Grill.  The atmosphere was fun.  I highly suggest you checking it out when you are in Mandalay Bay!!!!",

    "text": "Okay y'all. This is the dark horse best scallops I've ever had. And I've had some good scallops, seeing as I lived in Florida for a few years. Just wanted to say that first for those who skim.   I'm local, so my mom suggested I try it out here. Straight to food: we got a blood orange mojito. Sparkling white peach lemonade. Free chips and salsa. 2 free sweet corn tamales (not on menu - ask about them). Al pastor tacos. And shrimp & scallops a la plancha. And a plain flour tortilla.   The peach lemonade was delicious. Mojito was a bit heavy handed on tequila, which is probably an upside for other people. The tomatillo salsa was the clear winner, but the other two were smoky and tasty. The tortilla chips are really well done. I'd buy just their salsa and chips to take home if I could conveniently do that. The sweet corn tamale wasn't what I'd call a tamale, but was 4 bites of deliciousness, complemented very well by the sour cream, which I assume is made from scratch.   Entrees: my boyfriend is a simple man, so got the tacos. The meat was super juicy. It comes with three on a plate, but he only ate one there. He says the marinade on the meat was the best part.   I got the shrimp and scallops. It was omg so good. The ancho chile reduction is too good to explain fully. It was not spicy, but had that good flavor of heat in it. The scallops were so soft, I could have just spun my fork in it. The paella bites were a lot more mild in flavor, which was a nice break. Shrimp had a nice charcoal flavor, the squash made everything a bit sweet. Just. So good. Still in heaven. I had to take some home, but I ate all the scallops there and pretty much cleaned the 1/2 of the plate I ate.   The chairs were comfortable. Our server was extremely animated, but seemed to genuinely enjoy being able to give people good food. I think we undertipped now that I'm reviewing math, but I'll hopefully come back and overtip to compensate. The art style is weird - I've never been a fan of that style. But I do respect the continuity from the walls to the napkins to the plates.   I'm going in for surgery this week, so today was our last hurrah. I told my boyfriend that I'm fine if I can't eat solids for a few weeks because this meal was good enough to make up for it.",

So I was never a red meat eater in my life, I stopped eating meat at 5 years old so a meat burger taste doesn't appeal to me. This burger though is fantastic and my 2 MALE carnivore friends also had their burger and they said \"I eat meat and I wouldn't be able to taste the different\". Then as time was passing would refer back to how good the burger was and couldn't believe it.  I seriously contemplated about ordering a second one for myself so go try it out!  Other items we ordered and is pictured below is their house made guacamole what Chips & Salsa, they're Impossible empanadas, the vegan relleno (made with quinoa and cauliflower) and there Mexican chocolate sorbet for dessert. Everything was so amazing we asked to see the chef but they had the night off so hopefully they will come across this review.  This is my 2nd time here and both visits did not disappoint. From their delicious vegan food to their friendly service, you won't be disappointed with choosing this Border Grill to dine. My friends visiting said that was the best meal they've had on the trip and worth the walk.  I would also like to mention that our server Candice was also fantastic. She was so upbeat, so happy and so much fun to be around that she really added a lot more pleasure into our dining experience.   Try this spot out! *****",

I want a to go back I'd like 50 pounds of chips! Comes with three different salsa. All of which are quite good but I found myself eating the chips plain.   I ordered the Poblano chicken enchiladas and they were super good. Great flavor combination. My husband had the chili rellenos duo. They were both super fantastic!! When my husband was done eating he did find a plastic binder in his dish (from the fresh produce). The staff was super embarrassed and apologized so many times. They also removed the item from our check. Even with finding this in his food I still give this place five stars because of how great they handled it (mistakes do happen!) and the food is just that good.",

We started of with some cocktails, I had a margarita and my wife had a black cherry mojito, both were great.   We also got the queso fundido, which is like mexican fondue with chorizo, and it was delicious.   Had we only come in for drinks and apps I would probably be giving 5 stars.  But we stayed and ate dinner.  On the servers advice, I had the smoked beef taquitos, they were okay, but they certainly were not $23 taquitos.   My wife ordered the fish tacos with crispy fish, they brought it with grilled fish, no biggie as my wife likes both.  This grilled fish however, was very bland.  You could taste char and little else.  The fish wasn't necessarily burnt, just flavorless so the little char that was there from the grill marks was overwhelming.  We asked for some extra hot salsa and it never showed up.   $140 later, we realized that we should have stuck to drinks and apps.",

So make sure you order a head if you think you would still like to sample another item on the menu. My wife also enjoyed the place as well. I think we will be back again soon. Not sure if a reservation is necessary but why risk it. It's Vegas, you never know how things are going to be.",

I was very excited about all the gluten free selections and my fish tacos on corn shells were wonderful!  We will definitely go back on our next trip.",

They could have just said no and sold me my second choice (at a higher price), but they went the extra mile and that also deserves a call-out.  Great chips, great ceviche, a beautiful day on a nice patio watching beautiful girls by the pool...with my beautiful wife at my side.  What could be better?",

    "text": "the border grill is a mexican restaurant located in the Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino Resort.  It is the last eating establishment along restaurant row. a few of us were already hesitant about eating at a mexican restaurant in section that also has a wolf gang puck's trattoria, red square, fleur de lys,  michael mina's strip steak, etc.    the decor of this restaurant was outstanding.  the vibrant yellow and orange painted walls decorated with mexican art brightened the whole restaurant in the evening.  i was very surprised at the size of the restaurant.  it has actually two levels with the lower level accommodating larger parties of 6 or more.  the lower level connects to some outdoor seating, which i look forward to taking my lovely dining companion on the milder vegas nights for some drinks.   we started off on some homemade tortilla chips that had just the right amount of saltiness.   it was complimented so well with the salsa roja and salsa verde.  one of the other red salsas had a fruity tinge to it, but   not strong enough to be identified, so it was uninteresting.  we also ordered guacamole, which was a little more bland than i usually like.   they were generous on the avocado, but i think they could have done a better job in adding some more kick (spice, tanginess, saltiness). when the waiter mentioned that the Cochinita Pibil was a southern mexican specialty that is rarely found in menus here in the U.S., i immediately knew that i had to order that dish.  basically, it is a specially marinated pork that has been slow roasted with or in banana leaf with cinnamon and grilled onions.  it was accompanied by black beans, rice, and plantains with orange salsa on the side.   sounds yummy, unfortunately after i gave the first bite to the GF, she immediately let me know that i could have the rest of the bite.  i said to myself, \"OH NO could it be that BAD?\"  i was disappointed at how tough the pork was and how the whole dish lacked any zest.  maybe the tortilla to wrap the meat took away the flavor, or the onions and banana leaf muffled some of the flavors away.  either way, the GFs grilled skirt steak was a lot more tastier.  she ordered it rare and you can actually taste the marinate of garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime.  she found that her taste buds loved in the beginning and was bored with it towards the end.  i also loved eating her charred corn relish, i will have to be honest that the price for our meals were a bit high ~$80/2 people for mexican food.  there are tons of other great mexican restaurants/taquerias in las vegas that are much cheaper and better tasting.  i will have to admit that i will return for drinks.  the mojitos (regular or mango) are very delicious.  ask the GF!!!  they were extra sweet, very refreshing, with a minty bite.  they also have caipirinha (a brazilian concoction, which lacked the tang that i was used to).  i yet have to find this drink anywhere else in vegas.",

Regardless, told her I made a reservation - thank god I did, who does that for lunch anyways - we were seated right away. Then both the hostess who seated us and the server told us it may take 3 hours to bring our food, or maybe just normal time -they can't be sure- because there is 'only one kitchen running'. What??? Did you just say it may take 3 hours for our food to come? We are talking about a taco plate. Eventually it did not take so long (phew), our plates came in 15 minutes. Our server was pretty attentive. The food... Guacamole was perfect. Salsa was like a premade jar salsa, but tasting ok. Margaritas were meh. Fish in the fish tacos was pretty bad. The carne asada tacos were a much better choice, a little drenched in oil though. Overall, $80 for 2 for mediocre taco plates and 2 drinks is pretty steep.",

I was attending a large conf. at Mandalay and have eaten at Border Grille and its sister restaurants in LA and always loved it.  Yesterday felt like I was in a rest. that was poorly run by a staff who was not centered on great customer service.  I sat on the busy patio at a dirty table and with furniture that has seen better days.  It took over 10 min. before a server ever addressed me and the table seated next to me that had arrived before.  Long story short--my drinks were never refilled without me having to chase someone down even though they were nearby and even after my meal arrived I had to ask for utensils/napkin - the waiter never noticed.  Table next to me some situation.  Waiter never asked me about my meal.  SO....whilst I love their food someone in mgmt. at the rest. needs to consider a serious training day to push customer experience...otherwise, there are many other choices in Vegas.",

The husband who isn't a steak lover got the carne asada tacos which came with pickled onions, guacamole, and beans with two kinds of rice. All of which he killed in seconds- I take it he liked it.

    "text": "I went to Border Grill this past weekend and thought, on the whole, it was great.  We started with cocktails at the bar (while we waited for our table which wasn't ready at 7:30 when we arrived).  One friend had a great Malbec, another a pina colada-esque drink which I thought was too sweet but wasn't something I'd ever order anyway, and I had the watermelon mojito which was BY FAR the best mojito I've had in my life, hands-down.  Highly recommended.  They're seasonal, apparently, so hustle over and get one if you're in the area.  10 minutes later our table for five- outside, corner half booth - overlooking the Mandalay lazy river pool was ready.    It was obviously hot on a July night in Vegas, but there were fans and it was bearable.  Maybe next time I'd sit in inside, but when on vacation and celebrating a birthday, we figured being outdoors would provide a nicer ambiance . Whatever.  Water was a .50/cent per person charge which I've never heard of, but it was filtered and it was fine.    The food was delicious.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla to start which was flavorful (great cheeses, not greasy, spicy without being overpowering) and overall a 9/10.  A friend and I split the chicken enchiladas which were phenomenal.  So so good.  I'm guessing the server was new (or just not savvy) because when we asked originally for recommendations she had no reasons on which to base her recommendations and seemed to pick the most expensive things on the menu.  Coming from a former server who notices these things, that was a mistake.  We ordered, therefore, what we thought we'd like best and disregarded her meaningless suggestions, and from the baja ceviche to the enchiladas, to the chocolate pie-esque dessert, everything was great.  Minus 1 star for service and a slight delay on the table, but otherwise well above average.  I would definitely come back for that mouthwatering watermelon mojito and those enchiladas in a heartbeat.  Oh, and it was a little pricey, but not really compared to your typical over-priced Vegas fare.  First Yelp Review, ever.  Hopefully good. :)",

Everything is home made in the restaurant and fresh.  We tried the guacamole both times and it was so yummy.  We ordered Margaritas and the red wine sangria.  For lunch we split the pork carnitas (shredded pork) and it came with rice and black beans.  The pork was cooked well, but it wasn't shredded but cubed.  I thought it would have been shredded already.  Besides that, it was very good.  For dinner we each had the skirt steak and that came with beans, tomato and cucumber salad, and an amazingly delicious handmade tortilla.  The steak was cooked and seasoned well.  The sides (salad and beans) were awesome!  But the best part of it was actually the handmade tortilla.  When you wrapped the steak, beans, and tomato in the tortilla that really made it.  The ambiance was so-so, they need to figure out how to give it a better atmosphere.  The lights were too bright and the way the dining room was set up was awkward.  The prices were a bit higher than I care to spend at any Mexican restaurant, but its Vegas.  I'd go back for lunch or dinner if I am in the Mandalay Bay hotel again.",

My fiance and I were staying at the Four Seasons and wanted to have lunch outside within close proximity to our pool.  We sucked it up and went to Border Grill.  My fiance had a hackerin' for some ceviche and I really wanted a cocktail with lunch.  They had a special Spring menu chalk full of goodies.  We started out with two lemon blueberry mojitos and shared the ceviche.  The mojitos were one of the best I have had.  It was a perfect call from the waiter.  As for the ceviche we couldn't get enough of it.  There was nothing left.  To complete our lunch we split their Chicken Panuchos.  They're like mini harsh shell tacos.  The tortillas of the tacos are stuff with black beans and then fried.  Of course this was devoured.  This dining experience has changed my opinion completely about the Border Grill chain.",

I'm a huge fan of Ciudad here in L.A. and was really excited about having dinner at the Border Grill. I was so excited that even though my fellow Yelpers warned me about the bad service and sub-par food, I still threw caution to the wind and had dinner there. Apparently, I thought I was special and would get a 5 star experience. I was wrong and I suffered the consequences.   The food was ok although nothing special. The $17 ceviche plate was redonkulous - seriously about 5 bites worth of ceviche and not even enough to share. Total rip-off.  My plantain empenadas were good but not incredible. The strawberry sangria was so  weak it made a wine cooler seem like a strong shot of alcohol and it was $12. I don't get really uptight about paying a premium for good food but not for this. This is what I could have got at a decent taco stand.   The service was abysmal. Our waiter was inattentive (to say the least) and even seemed to have some awareness as to how bad the service was and yet, didn't make attempts to improve it. On three occasions he walked by our table and noted, \"Oh, your food isn't out yet? It will come soon\". Well, it didn't come soon and he didn't make any attempts to go into the kitchen to make sure it was on it's way. At the end of the meal we waited about 30 minutes just to get the check and finally flagged down another waitress and asked if she would get it for us. She stated that our waiter would be by soon  and then just headed about her business. Basically, no one is going to make a move to make sure that the customer gets what they need and you just better sit and wait it out. That is expected at the DMV but at a place where I'm dropping $150 for a meal? No, that won't cut it. I did note that our waiter appeared to be covering far too many tables and that this probably played a role in his ability to provide service, which is probably a management level issue that needs to be looked at. All in all, a major bummer of a dining experience.",

The weekend brunch was so good and a great deal - like an all you can eat buffet but better because it is prepared to order. There are about 15 small plates on the menu and you can try as many as you want. They were all excellent. We will definitely go back anytime we are in Vegas. Great view from the top patio overlooking the Mandalay pools.",

I love Mexican food, just a heads up.....the Cadillac Margarita was small and not very strong, although made with fresh lime juice, so it's very refreshing. ($14.00) The chips are made with the tortillas there, you can tell, and they are really good......their fresh tortilla were amazing.....seriously some of the best I have ever tried. The Vegetarian Black Beans were great, the cheese is like a feta cheese, not my favorite, but my GF liked it a lot. Her BF ordered the Nachos, and they were just a huge portion size and very very good. The Shrimp Tacos were not too good in my opinion. Just difficult to eat, not a very good sauce and just not very good in general. The Fish Tacos, according to my friend were the best she ever had! My bean and cheese burrito was only $4.00 compared to their $16.00 meals, so I was very happy with it. Very filling, and just make sure you order it with Black Beans, cause I got the re fried beans the first time around and I didn't think they were very good. The salsa they have there is delicious. They are not cheap about it either, they keep it coming. The service was just OK though.",

    "text": "This place just doesn't cut the mustard. It's too expensive, too crowded and just not that great. It's OK food. But really, I think it's pretty basic Mexican food served on nice plates with a higher price. I think two of us spent $40 for lunch, sharing something. Service is slow too. I'd love to stop in for a quick drink, late night, but it's always too swamped. I think they have a great location, which is why it's always too busy. They nickel and dime for everything in here, so don't order anything out of the ordinary. If the prices were 1/2 to 1/3 of what they charge, I'd return. Otherwise, no thanks. I do recommend T'n'T over at Luxor. That place was surprisingly good and I thought, much cheaper. I also recommend Isla at TI and Taqueria Canonita at The Venetian. Unfortunately, Margaritas at The Frontier is obviously gone, or I'd recommend that, as well. Anyway, keep looking, this place just isn't worth it.",

    "text": "Having heard the \"Two Hot Tamales\" on the radio for some time, I was eager to give their restaurant a fair shake.  As we approached the restaurant, a neon sign hung underneath the Border Grill announcing \"REAL MEXICAN FOOD.\"  Already, that's a bad sign...  Anyway, here's a recap.  The food is very good, but certainly not worth the outrageous prices that are on the menu.  My wife and I both had one drink, guacamole and a main dish for just under $100.  The meal portions are a little on the small side (for Mexican food), but just right for anything else.  The ingredients are fresh but both meals appeared to be hurried with very little attention to detail.  The dining area is a bit cramped and if you are unlucky enough to sit next to people with children, then you will no doubt listen to the world's most fascinating conversations.  In the end, would I go back?  Definitely not.  There are some real great Mexican restaurants off the strip in Las Vegas, if you have a  car, please make the drive.  For the price that we paid, we could have feed a family of 6 anywhere else.",

So, the good, GREAT chips and decent three salsas to dip them in.  I really liked the chips.  Also the atmosphere was wonderful, we sat outside and it wasn't really hot so it was perfect.  Also our waitress, Chelsi was very sweet.  However, the main dishes were not great.  Two had the chicken quesedillas which looked good and with the lime had some flavor.  I had the fish tacos, there were three to the plate, I had two grilled and one deep fried.  The amount of fish was miniscule and there were big strips of lettuce on the tortilla.  Cabbage, yes, but lettuce?  I've had much better fish tacos at the farmer's market near my house.  As for the drinks, one pina colada, didn't try it but heard it was good, and my horrible mojito.  I mean it was unbearably sweet and the mint leaves in the glass were old and brownish.  Yuck.  Plus price tag for that mean was over $80.  That is ridiculous for the quality of what we had.  Good chips!",

But the tacos are small and loaded with taste so you leave feeling sated by taste but not in pain form over eating.  Now the bad. As we sat on the balcony a large loud group of hotel media people crowded onto the balcony all around our table talking about lining up shots and ignoring all the customers.

We had the avocado (ok, kind of dry), the carnitas (pretty good, not exceptional), and the chicken panucho (extremely oily, no real flavor).  This came with beans and rice (red and green), which were ok.  This was easily enough for the two of us to share.    Our dining companions ordered the three tacos (shrimp and Yucatan pork were both deemed \"good,\" can't remember the third) and the Border Classics (chicken panuchos and some tamales and empanadas), which was also \"good.\"    There is a .50 charge for water, which I thought was odd; it included still or sparkling water.

    "text": "Interesting that most of the hidden reviews are 1 star reviews.  Seriously Yelp?    Was here 2 weeks ago and was really looking forward to trying this place but left without trying it due to inconsiderate service.  Planned on ordering a few entrees and a couple of their desserts, including the tres leches cake since I have heard much about their food.  Came here at 8 PM this evening and asked to be seated with two kids.  Hostess told me we could be seated right away and directed me to go to the downstairs dining room.  I proceeded to walk down the stairs  went to the hostess booth and there was nobody to be found.  Waited for a few minutes then went to an employee standing close to the area to ask where we should sit.   She shushed me immediately, mid-sentence.  I was quite taken aback as I'm not sure why she shushed me.  I was not being loud at all and the kids were silent.  She then said to me \"we're having a wedding\" and directed me to go down the hall to where the tables were.    I was pretty ticked off at being shushed but grudgingly walk down to where the tables were and stood there for five minutes with nobody acknowledging me.  Finally gave up, told the manager what happened and left immediately.  The manager said \"yeah we're having a wedding\", proceeded to ask me if i had a reservation (after i told him what just occurred) and offered to seat me but at that point the damage was done.  Walked over to the Subway shop in the Mandalay Bay food court and while the food was mediocre the service was extraordinarily better than my experience at Border Grill.   Thanks for making me feel like an unwanted customer.    With the amount of restaurants in Vegas, the least you could do is make a new patron feel welcome.   And yes, while i understand there was a wedding going on in a separate outside area--not inside--even if it it was the royal wedding itself, you should never ever be rude to a guest.  If quietness was a concern, then it is the restaurant's responsibility to rope that area off or maybe don't seat people downstairs if your employees don't want anyone asking them questions.  Never again.",

They were absolutely delicious. We also ordered the border guacamole (without onions), which I'm glad we did because the salsa is a bit unremarkable. Everything on the menu looked delicious (and so fitting) for a Vegas lunch - a little bit healthy, a little bit filling, and a lot of tasty. I settled on the turkey tostada - something I wouldn't normally go for but am so glad that I did. The grilled turkey was sliced thin and had the perfect grill char on it. And between the black beans, roasted corn, and cucumber slaw, I was in heaven. The flavors were fabulous and I stuffed myself with every last good bite. I definitely recommend checking out the Border Grill!",

Our waitress's response to everything was \"yasss\"....which is seriously annoying when you have unlimited small plates and bottomless mimosas. The small plates are SERIOUSLY small and not that great, especially for the price. The corn tamales were very mushy, the eggs were overcooked on every plate, and the fries were overdone. The steak and eggs was the best of the lot. I think they would be better off making a couple of solid, delicious brunch entrees instead of small mediocre plates, but that's just my opinion. Most likely won't come back.",

Having been in restaurant and bar management for ten years I can be your worst enemy, but JP the bartender was not only a great mixologist, but personable and very knowledgeable. I WILL HIGHLY recommend anyone coming through Vegas to stop by here even if you are not staying at the the hotel. The kitchen also is KILLING it at their job. The presentation was incredible and the flavor was not only amazing but complex, fresh and very well balanced. I've never given a five star rating but they absolutely deserve it!",

We were staying at the Mandalay Bay and wanted something with a little variety.  I love the idea of a tapas brunch menu.  You can order to your hearts content with one flat fee per person... and add $10 a person for bottomless mimosas.  They have so many different flavors, it made my head spin!  I tried one of each flavor... so my head was spinning afterwards for a different reason.    Service was spot on - they left you alone at the right times and checked back often to see if we wanted to order anything else or needed a refill on our drinks.  This was a nice break away from the traditional buffet style that's so popular in Vegas.    I will be back!",

I would order it again in a heartbeat. We also ordered dessert. The Mexican chocolate cream pie was extremely delicious and very, VERY rich. I ordered the smaller portion and still couldn't finish it. My spouse had the flourless chocolate cake and said it was quite good. I had a small bite of his, but between the two, I prefer the Mexican pie.   Atmosphere and service are nothing exceptional. It's a perfectly ordinary restaurant that happens to put out some exceptionally good Mexican food. They do get bonus points for sustainable sourcing of the meats though. That's something that's important to my family and I was glad to see them take that stance.  I can't say that it's a \"can't miss\" establishment, but if you have the time and are craving Mexican food, this is a great place to try.   I'd recommend brunch, for the added bonus of $10 bottomless mimosas.",

The chips were delicious! Hot, lightly salted, great flavor. All 3 of the salsas were tasty as well. Our bartender was very friendly and personable, and also gave us a card for 15% off any meal because we are locals.   After we were seated, the dining experience went downhill a bit. Our server was not nearly as friendly as the bartender and seemed a tad bit put off by us. I ordered the halibut special, which I was not a big fan of. The fish was pretty dry, and the risotto patty underneath it (I'm not sure what it was called), was alternately creamy and crunchy.  The rest of my party enjoyed their meals, however. I sampled the chicken quesadilla, which was very good.   Entrees ranged between $20-$35, which was a little high, but understandable for a Strip restaurant with a celeb chef name.",

    "text": "When I asked my mom what type of food she wanted for her birthday, she suggested brunch or Mexican and the first place that came to mind was Border Grill.   I have been on numerous occasions in the past for both brunch and dinner and have always liked Border Grill, but hadn't been in quite some time so was excited to see if they have stayed consistent over the years and what new dishes they had to try. We arrived at 11 on the dot and were seated quickly on the covered patio. Our drink orders were taken and the fruit and guava pastry was brought out for us to enjoy.   We ordered just about everything off the brunch menu but here are a few of the notable items we tried.   Loved:   -GREEN CORN TAMALE (sweet corn * sour cream * salsa fresca) I'm a sucker for sweet corn tamales, so there really wasn't much I didn't love about this dish.  -PERUVIAN SHRIMP AND GRITS (aji panca chile marinated shrimp * roasted poblano chiles creamy parmesan grits) - nice kick and flavor.  -SKIRT STEAK AND EGG (egg cooked your way * crispy poblano potatoes) - My fella loved this dish so much he ordered it twice. The steak was cooked well and had a great texture. One of the highlights of the meal. -MACHACA CHILAQUILES (slow cooked beef brisket * crispy corn tortilla chips mexican cheeses * roasted chiles * egg cooked your way) - My mom's favorite dish. The brisket was moist and flavorful and the dish had a nice kick. Definitely a must order.  -WAFFLE AND PORK BELLY WITH MAPLE SYRUP (french waffle * crispy pork belly * maple syrup) - This was one of my favorite dishes. Pork was cooked well and I really enjoyed the sweet and savory flavor combination. Big fan.   Liked:   -SHORT RIB HASH AND EGG (negra modelo braised beef short ribs * boniato yams * caramelized onions) - This dish was just ok. The short ribs were entirely too sweet and I had entirely too many onions for any of our tastes.  -BREAKFAST FRIES (hand cut fries * crispy carnitas * chipotle hollandaise jalapeno bacon * sunny side egg) - The carnitas were great and had a fantastic crisp to them. The flavors were amazing, but I wasn't a huge fan of the fries, wish they were crispier or had more flavor.  -BREAD PUDDING FRENCH TOAST (caramelized bananas * coconut syrup) - This rendition of French toast is overly sweet, but still had nice flavor in moderation. Make sure you share this and order it for dessert.  CRISPY POTATO RAJAS TACO (roasted potatoes and chiles * mexican cheeses guacamole * grilled corn relish * chipotle aioli) - Nice and spicy, definitely a good dish, if only it had some protein or meat in it to balance it out a bit more.  LOBSTER PANCAKES (savory corn lobster pancake * chipotle sauce sunny side egg * crispy leeks) - This dish was enjoyable, not a lot of lobster in it and I wish the pancake had a fluffier texture, though.   Hated:   -CHURRO TOTS (dulce de leche infused churros * cinnamon sugar * whipped cream) - This dish sounded amazing in theory, but when they arrived, they were hard little balls lacking flavor and texture. Definitely pass on these. -YUCATAN EGG BENEDICT (manchego cheese biscuit * yucatan roasted pork slow cooked egg * hollandaise sauce * pickled onions) - I can never resist an eggs benedict, the exception lies here. The cheese biscuit was overly doughy and pretty unappetizing. Nothing about this dish worked for me, which was disappointing.  -BREAKFAST ENCHILADA (citrus chicken * guajillo sauce * mexican cheeses black beans * fried egg) - This dish was the worst of the worst. First off, it came out cold. Nothing could be a bigger turn off. The flavor was meh and since it was cold we had no interest in delving further into it.   Overall, my mom had a fantastic birthday meal and that's all I wanted from Border Grill and they definitely delivered all that and more. They even surprised my mom with a chocolate mousse cake to cap off a very nice brunch experience. I can't believe I've left if off my radar for so long in between visits. Make sure to get their rewards card if you're a local as they offer discounts!",

    "text": "Border Grill has the best brunch in Vegas.  There. I said it. So why doesn't it get 5 stars? Two minor issues, both of which can be easily fixed. (More on that later...)  We sat on the patio for Easter brunch. Although it was crowded, service was pretty fast, and the food--as usual--was delicious. For $40 each (plus $15 each for bottomless mimosas), my husband and I tried the following (in order of preference):  Breakfast Fries (The BEST! Can't go wrong with Mexican poutine!) Chicken and Blue Corn Waffle Yucatan Egg Benedict Chorizo and Egg Taco Smoked Salmon Slider Fried Green Tomatillos Machaca Chilaquiles Fresh Fruit (served in a pastry cone) Egg White Oyster Rockefeller (too much egg; not enough oyster) Bananas Foster Crepes Plus copious cucumber mimosas for me and traditional ones (with OJ) for him  Per usual, we ordered from the menu, and the staff brought out the food in waves. As I said, the food was great, and our waiter kept the drinks coming. I was pleasantly surprised by the cucumber mimosas, which I'd never had (or heard of) but are now definitely my favorite.  Unfortunately, there was some miscommunication between the kitchen and the servers, because our food kept going to the wrong table and we kept getting food that we didn't order. That wasn't too big a deal, because all the diners around us were friendly and had no problem passing over the correct plates, but it seemed like the tickets were somehow one table off.  The other minor problem was that there was nothing to put your used silverware on while you were waiting for your next plates to come out. We ended up tearing an empanada in half and using it as spoon rests for our forks and knives, but it would be great (and easy) to just bring out a couple of little plates for diners to rest their silverware on. (Especially for us diners on the patio, where the tables were a little dusty.)  That said, we will definitely be back to Border Grill, and I hope I can bump my grade up to 5 stars next time around. (And I hope they put the Breakfast Fries on the permanent brunch menu. YUM-MY!)",

    "text": "If you happen to be at Mandalay Bay for a convention then this place sure beats the food court down the hall, I said to myself while in search of my only meal that day.  I wouldn't recommend going out of one's way to dine here though since there are far better Mexican restaurants elsewhere in town.  Border Grill is the epitome of a tourist trap as one would expect given its location.  Going in I new this but the scene was quite bleak at the other spots and the food court was crowded and well, I don't eat fast food.  In retrospect I should have gone to the food court.  The service, at the bar hightop was great, but serving stale tortilla chips?  This is 2015 at a premier spot on the Strip with prices two times what they should be for Mexican fare.  I drank an Arnold Palmer, or two, OK it was likely three...those were decent and I believe the bartender made them with fresh lemonade.  The entree, I don't recall what it was but it was probably something safe, such as a chicken quesadilla.  The fact that the entree doesn't stand out in my recollection of the meal but the stale soggy chips does proves my point; this place is merely \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"",

    "text": "We stopped in for Border Brunch on our last day in Vegas and boy am I happy we did. As far as vegetarian meals go in this town, this was BY FAR the best.   For $34.99, you can have unlimited small plates off the brunch menu. Following the advice of our waiter (who was awesome, by the way), we \"ordered more of what we liked, and didn't eat what we disliked.\" A perfect fit for the excess and grandiosity of this town.   We started with the Yogurt Parfait, which was light and cleansing. Fresh fruit layered with homemade granola and yogurt, with a slightly sour lime zest on top. It fit the tropical resort feel of Mandalay Bay flawlessly. The Green Corn Tamales were up next. They are not traditional tamales, but rather use a blend of sweet corn. I found the taste pleasant and enjoyed the pairing of the sweetness with the salsa fresca and sour cream.  We also sampled the Tres Leches French Toast, which is a wonderful option if you have a sweet tooth. The Brioche was flavorful and perfectly cooked and I didn't find the pairing of fresh berries to be overly sweet. It was perfectly decadent. I also really enjoyed the Chilaquiles. This was my first encounter with this dish and I found their presentation of flavor to be quite good. The fried egg was fabulous with the spicy avocado puree and smoked tomato salsa. I do wish the crispy corn tortilla chips had been slightly more crispy, but they were still well flavored.   Our favorite dish, by far, was the Cauliflower Taquito. We ordered this one three times in one sitting. The spicy avocado salsa does have a kick to it, but the flavor is extremely satisfying and pleasant. It really is just the perfect amount of spice. I was unsure if the jicama slaw would be a good companion, but it did balance the spiciness of the salsa quite well.   It was very hard to find unique brunch options that were accommodating to vegetarians in Las Vegas. I'm thrilled that we found the Border Grill as it provided a comparatively large selection. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Next time I'm in town, this place will be on the top of my list.",

But it also means that it's expensive.  Service and ambience are terrific. And the food was good... Great even... Just... a little uninspired.  I think I just find it very difficult to fall in love with most restaurants in Las Vegas with this model - I understand that everything is going to be expensive, and well done... But I tend to be dissatisfied with the model.   Over priced food, is over priced... This place would be fantastic if prices were like... 15% more affordable. As one who doesn't mind spending on a great meal, I hate spending $40 per person on a  mimosa, tacos, and chilaquiles brunch. That's all.",

I have gone twice with a group of girlfriends and it's really fun to just take your time there and try all the small plates & mimosa flavors. A few standout plates for me were the mini chorizo corn dogs, breakfast fries, and steak & eggs. The service is great - the staff continues to bring you more mimosas without you even asking, and kind of make you try various flavors based on what's on their tray. The last time I went, I was just going to get one mimosa, but it's the same price for unlimited sooo... :)  Definitely recommend to locals but for more of a special occasion / every once in a while treat because by the time you do tax & tip you're at ~$55 per person.",

I believe it was $35 a person which really isn't terrible for bottomless. (How many times can I say bottomless in a review)  Now.. Anyone who knows me, knows my hate for pulp in OJ. I don't care that its fresh orange juice, I don't need nasty chunks of stuff when I'm drinking thank you very much! They had a ton of different juices though but most of them had pulp (darn you for being so fresh). There was no turning back though so I found the pomegranate juice had the least pulp and I chugged away. It's located in Mandalay Bay and I would recommend making a reservation, just in case!",

In the span of two weeks, I found myself here for dinner and then Sunday brunch.  I feel like I should be embarrassed about this, but I have no shame.  If you force me to choose, I would say brunch is the star, but dinner was pretty fantastic too.  The chips and salsa in this town can be very hit or miss.  Border Grill's delivers.  I had chile relleno for dinner and loved it.  When I returned for brunch, I was corralled by a friend who swears their brunch is the best in town.  I am a die hard DW Bistro fan so I was prepared to set her straight.  Then I tried the chilaquiles.  And the skirt steak and eggs.  And the breakfast fries.  For $34.99, you get unlimited small plates.  The quality of the food is unexpectedly good for this price point.  Everything is fresh and the small plates allow you to try several things instead of limiting you to one large dish.  The only negative is that a few of the hot dishes did not come out piping hot, but this is likely due to the rush of people in the place.  You really cannot compare DW and Border Grill because the food, ambience and intentions are totally different.  This is a great spot for endless food options, bottomless mimosas and Mexican inspired brunch.  Can't wait to go back.",

Eating on the outdoor patio is definitely where it's at.  Mandalay Bay still has one of the prettiest pools in town and you can even enjoy the outdoor concerts at night without buying a ticket fyi.  Initial thoughts glancing over the menu was that a group of chefs in a bong circle came up with all of it.  How else does one come up with a \"bacon jalapeno peanut butter and jelly sandwich\"?   That was surprisingly good and definitely hit the hangover spot but probably would've even tasted better at 4:20am for some I reckon.  The \"short rib hash and egg\" was another standout.  I felt like I could actually taste the negra modelo the beef was braised in but it was more likely my lingering beer breath.  I also can't say no to machaca ever and their chilaquiles were something I gladly had thirds of.    Weekend brunches are getting more extravagent by the week on the strip and so are the prices.  $29.99 for all you can eat plus only $5 more for bottomless mimosas makes me feel like I got an amazing deal.  My only wish was that they ran this until 4pm instead of 2pm.  Gogogogogogo!!",

    "text": "Every now and then, you stumble into a restaurant that has just the right mix of attentive staff, authentic food and reasonable prices. The Border Grill in the Mandalay Bay has all the components mentioned above. In fact, they have motivated me to write this glowing review.  Our server, Autumn D was outstanding. She treated us like family and guided us through the menu like a professional. Autumn was on point with all of her recommendations. From the pomegranate limeade to the shrimp relleno tacos, we could not be happier with our dinner.   The food is pricey by the taco shop standards in San Diego. That said, The Border Grill is a modern restaurant in a beautiful hotel in Las Vegas. The menu prices are entirely reasonable when you consider the facts.   Not to mention the quality ingredients and expert preparation that cost a little more. The kitchen is not afraid to roast chiles here and stuff them with delicious shrimp. Those are some damn good tacos. Put them on the permanent menu if possible.   This meal was well worth the trip, and I look forward to visiting again. Here is what we had to eat...  Guacamole with chips Tacos de rajas Pescado Veracruzana Shrimp stuffed poblano chile tacos  Banana cream pie  Mexican Chocolate cream pie",

The watercress salad is amazing. I love the peppery taste of watercress and you don't see it often.  The jicama  really added to this.  My only complaint is it had a bit too much dressing on it.  The shrimp tacos were spicy but not too much. The shrimp were cooked very well. I would have preferred a flour tortilla to the corn one but it was excellent.  The cilantro rice that came with it was amazing.  I don't eat beans so I didn't try those.  They start you with chips and three salsas. One is smoky another and the other too are equally good.  My chips were pretty much crumbs but others I saw were fine.  Overall a good experience.",

As soon as we said we were vegetarians they gave us recommendations some of which were not even on the menu.  We got a veggie platter with plantain empanadas, sweet corn tamales , potato tacos, poblano quesadillas, and the black bean dip.  I can't even tell you how freaking good the quesadillas and tacos were.  The sweet corn tamales were so flavorful.  I usually dislike fancy Mexican but this was by far the best fancy mex I've ever had.  The service was so wonderful and the salsa trio that they give you was incredible fresh and zesty.   Thank god it was too much food that I had leftovers.  I'll be stuffing my face tomorrow morning .",

We ended up feeling a bit hungry in between meals (we were going to go from 1-9PM without eating) so we dropped in for a snack. We had a tuna something that was the special for the week. I'm not a big tuna fan, but it was pretty decent. The dessert was great, though. We ordered the bread pudding, also a special. It wasn't like any other bread pudding I've ever had. Definitely a lot more cinnamon present in the preparation. I was also glad that it didn't have raisins! All in all, a pretty good choice for a quick snack. I can't wait to go to have a full meal. If this visit was indicative of the level of service and quality of food, the full meal should be wonderful.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try the Border Grill in LA for the longest time.  But I was in Las Vegas for the weekend staying at Mandalay Bay, and there was a Border Grill at the Mandalay!  So me and my friends decided to give it a try.  I'm not a Vegas person at all since I don't like to gamble.  So I was just there for the pool, drinks and food!   Susan Feniger of the Two Hot Tamales is the mastermind of Border Grill.  I've heard a lot of great things about it, so I was very excited to try it out! We started out with the Cadillac margaritas and guacamole and chips.  I like my margaritas on the rocks no salt.  The waiter delivered mine with salt.  No biggie, I just wiped the salt away. The guacamole was okay.  It was a bit on the creamy side for my taste.   I prefer guacamole on the chunky side.  One of my friends just loved the guac. I decided to order one of the specials for the evening, which was highly recommended by our waiter.  It was tuna encrusted with pistachio served over a pobalno risotto topped with a jicama slaw.  My other two friends ordered the chile relleno and the pork slowly cooked in banana leaves.   The tuna was way overcooked.  So overcooked that it was dry.  The waiter when explaining the special said it was cooked medium (slightly pink).  The risotto was also a big disappointment.  Some parts seemed like it wasn't cooked enough.  My dish was a big disappointment.  Also, my meal wish lukewarm at best.  It seemed like it was sitting out for a while.  I should've returned it after the first bite but I didn't since I had a second cadillac margarita to wash it down. My friend's meals were way better than mine.  The chile relleno was very good.  But I thought the best meal was the pork slowly cooked in banana leaves.  It was cooked perfectly and great flavor. For dessert we shared the empanadas stuffed with dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate.  And we also shared the homemade ice cream, a scoop of vanilla bean, and a scoop of kahlua chip.  The dessert was the best part of the meal for me, unfortunately.  I really wanted to love Border Grill.  But my tuna special was a big disappointment.  I may give it a second try...this time checking out the LA restaurant.",

They remodeled the interior, tweaked the menu, and we are hooked.   My drink of choice has been the watermelon lemonade. It is not the same as the 1st few times I got it. It was a very slushy watermelon drink, like put a watermelon in the blender, add some lemonade and voila. Its more watered down now which is unfortunate but I've been getting this with a shot of patron silver in it, and I really like it.  My husband usually gets the fish tacos, you can get beer battered or grilled or both. He goes between the both. I like the kobe beef tacos.   They have a habanero salsa you can ask for. Its not one of the 3 they bring out. Its VERY good, but very hot. I highly recommend everyone try this.   We usually sit in the bar. The service is great, its just a little more casual, they have 2 TV's set to some type of sports event and I think thats why we're in there. If we have the kids, we're in the restaurant, but just us : Eating in the bar.   Good menu. Good drinks. Check it out.",

The tamale and taquitos were average, but the empenada had a funky taste to it. My husband had the Baja ceviche as his main course, it was a good ceviche. My dish was the Jumbo Shrimp. The shrimp were fine, nothing special, but the rice and veg served with it were so salty, it was inedible. It was this that caused the before mentioned bad taste.  We finished by splitting the Pastel Rufina. Soggy pastry, way too thick cream and not much taste except the chocolate chips.   I really wanted to like this place, I like the idea of sustainability. I like the Two Hot Tamales. I will say our service was great, but I go out for a great meal, great service is a bonus.   Sigh, I hoped for much more.",

Went to dinner with my hubby last night and came armed with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon.

Just to say, the service is amazing! Shout-out to Dale our waiter who was a whirlwind but still took the time to ensure that we were well looked after. He introduced the menu to us and ensured that we got the most of our experience. Our water glasses were full and our food was served in a timely manner. While our food was okay, I saw him deal with an unhappy customer who didn't like her dish. He took the food back right away without question and apologized because he recommended it. Kudos to Dale!  Okay, on to the food.  My husband ordered the Border Grill Experience which was $42 for 3 courses which included an appetizer sampler, a steak dish with quesadilla, and tres leches cake. I, being less hungry, just ordered an chicken enchiladas for $26.  The chips were perhaps a little overcooked for our tastes. The salsas in general lacked salt and acidity (I like the flavour of lime to come through). Of the four we received the chipotle and the diablo salsas were the only two that seemed to be seasoned properly.  The appetizer plate came with a plantain empanada, a taquito, and a corn tamale. The plantain empanada had great flavour but poor texture from sitting underneath a sauce for a little too long - it really killed the crispiness of a empanada. The taquitos were nice but were a little on the bland side. The corn tamale had the taste and texture of creamed corn. It was one big, hot, gummy mess - a big miss for me.  The steak entree was good - the marinated tomatoes, cucumber and avocado had a nice acidity that cut through the richness of the beef. The steak itself was a rather large portion which we took part of it home. The accompanying quesadilla however was a little too strong on the cheese flavour for me but had a nice crispness to it.  My enchiladas were good but yet again a little blander than what I was expecting. Overall, they could have used some more of the filling as well. The combination of chicken, corn, and peppers was ok - not outsanding.  The tres leches cake had the correct flavours but had difficulties with texture. The sponge was right but wasn't luxuriously drenched in a lovely milk all the way through. So the result was the bottom layers were nice but the top layers were a little on the dry side.  Overall, there are a lot of issues at Border Grill with regards to execution. Normally, I would have given this place a two however in light of our excellent service, I bumped it up to a three.",

    "text": "When I'm in Vegas Border Grill (inside the Mandalay Bay) is one of my favorite places to eat, which is why I am so surprised by it's rating.  The food, service and atmosphere are all fantastic. In my opinion, whoever gave this place less than four stars doesn't know what great Mexican food tastes like and should stick to chain restaurants like El Toritos.     The staff at BG is amazing. Everyone is friendly and welcoming from the moment you check in. We love to sit in Jamie's section because she is friendly, very attentive and full of energy. She is also very knowledgeable about the menu and how the items are prepared. She goes above and beyond to make sure we are happy. We never feel rushed or pushed to leave so that they can turn the table. That's rare at most restaurants in Vegas.   When you first arrive at your table you are welcomed with a basket of fresh  homemade tortilla chip and a trio of homemade salsas. Its a great way to start your evening. I love to order the guacamole as well. Its chunky, thick and simply delicious.   As far as drinks are concerned, I have tried many of them and have yet to be unhappy with a single one. The selection of mixed drinks are fabulous. I am, however, a big fan of the red sangria. Its just the right mix of wine and juice and it goes well with the chips and guacamole.   If you are in the mood to try a Border Grill culinary feast then I highly recommend you order the Ultimate Border Grill Experience. You get a trio of appetizers, an entree of your choice, and then a dessert of your choice. You really cant go wrong with this deal!   My ABSOLUTE favorite dish on the menu is the BBQ beef short ribs. They are wickedly delicious and mouth watering good.  The ribs are so tender that they fall apart and melt in your mouth.  The BBQ sauce has just enough kick to it, but isn't overpowering. The ribs are served atop a creamy corn polenta that is to die for.  I sometimes crave the dish... which, I must say, is worth driving to Vegas for.   Dessert is my thing and honestly you can't go wrong with any of the desserts on the menu. I have tried many of them and I haven't been disappointed yet.   Border Grill is definitely worth going to while in Vegas!!",

The restaurant was pleasant and the servers very welcoming and friendly.  We ordered plantain and black bean empanadas to share for an appetizer. These were really delicious, you could really taste the plantains. I could sit on my sofa at home and eat thirty of these things.  For the main course, I ordered the Carnitas which were tasty, though I would have preferred them in Tacos. I know I was taking a little risk ordering differently from usual. The carnitas came with some small, fluffy tortillas and a variety of fixin's - pico de gallo (which was a little sour), a slaw of some sort, guacamole, and a little salad of chopped red onion and cilantro. Overall it was very good, though I'd probably order more in line with my usual preferences next time.  My wife had the Mushroom Mulita which she enjoyed very much, although I'll let her go into that in greater detail when she writes her own review.  We had enjoyed our experience here so much that we were tempted into dessert. Something I really like about Border Grill is they let you get half slices of two of the dessert options for $9 as an alternative to a whole slice of one of them for $8. This lets you try two different things.  We went with the Flourless Chocolate Truffle Cake - absolutely melt-in-your-mouth incredible, and the Pastel Rufina, a sort of cream cheese cake in puff pastry and topped with profiterole-like objects. This came accompanied with an attractively arranged display of fresh berries. The Pastel Rufina, even for a half slice, was enormous and we couldn't finish the thing between the two of us. I'd hate to have to finish off a full sized slice!  While Border Grill is a little on the expensive side, the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon really brings it down into the realms of casual affordability. The food here is prepared with a deft hand and is really delicious. I can't wait to try the lunch options!",

Very tender and marinated in garlic, cilantro, cumin and lime. My fiance and I shared the Tres Leches for dessert. yummy!   Reasonably priced and excellent service! We felt completely ripped off after eating at RM Seafood the night before so we were very happy to receive the level of customer service you'd expect in Las Vegas.   Looking forward to going back and eating here again!",

    "text": "This restaurant was a joke. The Queso Fundido came out as a big hunk of cheese, and you couldn't even get a tortilla chip in it. Had to cut it vigorously with a knife.   The \"Guacamole\". What an insult. A \"ball\" of chopped avocado (no seasoning, no lime, no lemon juice, no nothing) with a ramiken of diced Bermuda onions on the side. I can go to a mid-level CHAIN Mexican restaurant and watch tableside FRESH guacamole being made, including all the ingredients/spices, etc.. A \"ball\" of avocado - That's it- that's all. I had to photograph it to believe it. Tasteless presentation. We asked for a few extra tortillas, since so few came with the Queso Fundido. They said \"that's a side we have to charge for\". Our bill for 4 people was $180 (only one pitcher of Marg's), and they have to charge extra for warm tortillas? The Margaritas were the only thing that brought it up from \"zero stars\" to \"1 star\".  I had the flat iron steak. Overly seasoned, a decent cut of meat, preparation with too much oil. The food was mediocre and over-seasoned. The two women \"chefs\" from New York need to go back to cooking school in my opinion. There are dozens of alternative choices to this place - I will seek them out next time. I also concur with another reviewer- There IS such a thing as  \"too much service\". They just inundated our table. Couldn't hold a conversation for 2 minutes without someone walking up, just busting into the conversation without waiting for a pause, and asking questions. It's called \"let your patrons enjoy their experience\".",

    "text": "Wondering around Mandalay while a little lost and hungover and encountered Border Grill for brunch.  The hostess seems a little confused about what the plan was since we wasn't selling it over well.  Once we figured out what the deal was, I was very exicted to eat there.  For $25 (or $30 with bubbles), you got to order from a Mexican style tapas menu with about 20 items.  It's also an all you can eat set up, so you can taste as many of the items on the menu as possible.   The same hostess tried to seat us at the worse table in the restaurant - a 2 top right by the kitchen door.  I asked if we could set anyplace else and she seems confused (again).  Luckily we got a larger table and everything went pretty smooth after that.  For some reason our waitor was held up somewhere and the manager came over to explain.  I'm glad that we ended up with the waitor that we did because she was friendly and did a great job.  We also tried a couple of their cocktails.  Since some of the other people mentioned that water issue - here is my take.  We were charged $1 for two waters and they must make their own water because it comes in special containers and tastes much softer.  Nothing like a $100 breakfast for two!",

The atmosphere is just okay, but I heard they have outdoor seating?  I wish I would've known!  I love sitting outside.  Food and atmosphere gets a 4 out of five star rating.  I have a lot to say about the cocktails, I'd give them a 3/5 rating.. maybe a 2.  I came here with my husband's family and I knew I was in for a pretty boring dinner.  Might as well have a couple martinis to make the visit more bearable!  The espresso martini tastes amazing, I had two of them.  They had a very spicey southwest taste to them that was fantastic and unusual, but WTF, where's the alcohol?!  I usually am pretty comfortably buzzed after two martinis but I didn't feel any love from the two I had here at Border Grill.  I sat through the rest of my dinner and day with the inlaws totally SOBER and pissed off about it.  They lose a star for being stingy with the alcohol.",

The hostess was pleasant and the waiter was attentive and very helpful giving menu recommendations. The outdoor seating was pleasant and blocked from the Vegas sun and wind. I would have given Border Grill a higher review if the food price was more in line with the food quality compared to other Vegas restaurants. Go for drinks and apps when they offer a brunch or lunch special (which is frequently).",

I had lunch here today and have had dinner here about 3 or 4 times even before Susan Feniger was on Top Chef Masters but now I have a better idea of why the food is so good!  I had the shrimp fajita tacos on their specials menu.  Delicious!  The shrimp were so juicy with a hint of spice.  We also had the pork tacos which were also amazing.  The pork is cooked for 3-4 hours which makes it very tender.  We also had the chicken enchiladas and fish tacos.  If you like spicy ask for the diablo sauce which is a habanero salsa.   The specialty drinks are dangerously good.  Sometimes they have the pozole soup on special which is amazing.  Pretty much if you are craving anything mexican, you can't go wrong here!",

The grilled chicken torta was absolutely delicious, and surprisingly well balanced - you could taste each ingredient and nothing overpowered.  And best of all, the sandwich didn't go soggy as so many do.  I wanted to like the smoked paprika fries, but honestly, nothing special. Citrus Chicken quesadilla was easily the best quesadilla I've been able to try in my somewhat limited experience.  4 people, $100 lunch all told.  Tasty food and good atmosphere.

You won't be disappointed, and due to the way it's served, you can get all you can eat without worrying about the previous guess sneezing on your eggs.  Would have never tried it due to location, but got a comp to eat at Border Grill Brunch in Mandalay. It's not a \"buffet\" brunch, but a tapas all you can eat for $29.99 and you can add all you can drink Mimosas for $5 (of various flavors), where they bring you tiny little plates of some of the tastiest Baja/Northern Mexican breakfast food I've ever had. Not to be missed were the Chilaquiles, the Plantain Empanada, and the Short Rib Hash and Egg. I live in Seattle, but miss the food I used to get at hole in the wall places readily in San Diego and Los Angeles. This comes mighty close, and the outdoor patio overlooks the pool area which can make for some...amusing...people watching.  WARNING: This is Cali/Zona border.  This is not Tex Mex.  I read so many reviews saying things like \"Lack of BBQ\" or \"Not really Mexican\".  Mexico has regional cuisine, just like the US or any other land mass.  Just because it's not what \"YOU\" consider to be border food or Mexcian food, doesn't mean it isn't... Baja is not the same as Gulf.  Yucutan is not the same as Oaxacan.  This is more of the NorthWestern/Baja Mexican.  Go in knowing that, and you'll be fine!  I may have stumbled upon it due to a comp as a first timer, but from here on out, it'll be the one \"lock\" on all my future Vegas trips.",

Was a dinner treat and felt that $300 was a waste to be blown for our table. The fish in the fish tacos was so bland and had too much onion that it was an overkill.  Pretty much could have eaten a handful of red onion and that was what the fish tacos were like.  The $30 fish based soup wasn't as good either.  I would rate Taco Bell or even Del taco way better just solely on their soft tacos.  Salsas were bland that just the store bought salsa molcajate would fare way better.  I think the best food was the Oaxaca steak dish that the table next to us had.  Lets just say my eyes got a better deal than my mouth.  Just looking at theirs seemed tastier than what majority of us on our table were putting in our mouths.  Please save your time and money by finding the nearest chipotle or Roberto's.",

A friend of ours told us we MUST try Border Grill when they found out we would be staying at The Mandalay Bay Hotel. We are thankful that we listened to the recommendation, what a great place full of ambiance, delicious food and impeccable service. Our servers name was Jessi and boy did she ever make our experience unforgettable. Welcoming us to the restaurant and asking if we have dined with them before. She started us off with a Holiday Margarita and I will be honest I had my doubts about this \"holiday\" drink but boy was she ever correct in her recommendation. To be honest I normally brush off entree specials that are suggested by servers but Jessi described the Mahi Mahi special so well that I could not turn it down. (it may have had something to do with her deep Mid West Accent that sold me but whatever it was I am thrilled I took her suggestion, what a great dish!) My Fiance had the Yucatan Pork (another suggestion of Jessi's) and he could not stop talking about it!  Jessi made us feel as if we were her most important guests, we never had an empty glass, never had a dirty dish sitting in front of us and I personally felt that Jessi anticipated our each and every need.  Being that we live so close and visit Las Vegas quite often we have decided that we will make this our regular spot every time we visit. Way to go Border Grill,with so many options to eat and drink in Vegas you have managed to gain 2 new fans of not only your food and drink but your staff!!!",

    "text": "Came here with a group of 6 last weekend for dinner. Service was pretty decent.   I'm only slightly familiar with the work of the two chefs, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger. Kudos to the duo for creativity of the dishes and the thorough knowledge of the waitstaff. They serve warm and crispy chips and 3 kinds of salsas; all unique and good. We started with an order of the guacamole, which was pretty standard. Nothing really stood out with the order and it was a tad bland.   For my main course, I ordered the Yucatan Pork ($24). It was a good-sized plate; price wasn't great but wasn't bad for restaurants on the strip. The pork itself was tender, but the flavor was just OK for me. There is a pretty heavy cinnamon flavor, which I found bright, surprising, and interesting, but that's really all I could taste. I think the dish was slightly bland and could have had a bigger variety of flavors. The rice and beans were very standard and uninteresting. I was a fan of the plantains that came with the dish, though.   Overall, just an OK experience for me. I would definitely be open to revisiting and trying some of the other dishes, as a lot of them sounded interesting and creative.",

Thanks to my Yelp check in offer, I got to try the sweet tamales, which were a first for me, but very tasty. I also sipped on a mojito and ordered the al pastor tacos and told them to make it extra spicy. Okay so, don't do that unless you want to burn your mouth off lmao they were good, but A LOT spicier than I expected! We ended the meal with a complimentary birthday dessert - I think they were salted chocolate chip cookies and some kind of delicious ass ice cream...AMAZING! Our server was adorable and you could tell she loves her job-she was awesome. Thank you for a lovely birthday dinner!",

We all got $3 tacos - the fish one was AMAZING. We also ordered guac, coconut shrimp, chicken nachos and chicken quesadilla. And to top it off, we all got $5 margs!   The chicken quesadilla was truly unreal. It was full of flavor and the cheese was soooo good. By far my favorite!   The environment of the restaurant was nice too. Mexican music in the background, not too loud. Very clean and good service. We sat at high top tables near the bar area.   Overall, great Mexican food in Vegas, great for big groups, and I would definitely come back!",

We love the wait staff that are always friendly and informative of the menu's, new specials and the tour guide of the tapas menu.  Candice and Darlene we very attentive, and made incredible suggestions that we followed and loved. Now the Pastry Chef....I'm sorry i forgot his name (white Chocolate)-he'd understand that-he served us such an amazing desert menu, and when i say the whole menu between the two of us we ate like 6 different deserts...i dont regret it at all. i was stuffed but kept eating because it tasted so amazing! I would defiantly recommend this place to all my friends and famiy and you my yelp family try out this place.   It offers sustainable organic grass fed meats and fresh caught fish the offer many gluten-free-free vegan and vegetarian options. This place is perfect for those of you who have special diets I need something healthy but delicious at the same time all you vegans and vegetarians gluten-free. This place is for everyone.",

    "text": "Wow, way overrated.  The service stank, on an empty Monday night at 8pm even though I made a reservation in advance!  I waited 15 minutes for water and a drink order and it took another 15 to get a drink and order.  I started with Queso Fundido.  It took 20 minutes to arrive and was, despite the description, basically a blob of panela cheese (rubbery farmer cheese) that was thrown in a ramekin and waved under the broiler.   There was no browning of the cheese and it was ice cold in the middle, with the consistency of a tennis ball.  It was topped with a few stringy grilled onions and peppers.  Real Queso Fundido should be oozy goodness, molten and delicious with onions in it, not on it.  Leave to the two Hollywood Gueras to screw up such a basic and simple appetizer.  The main dish was \"Yucatan Pork\" - pulled pork in banana leaf. It was dry dry dry.  No taste, no oily carnitas goodness.  Blah.  No flan on the menu for dessert.  For the $50 I dropped there, I'd have had an equally authentic and quality meal at Taco Bell for one tenth the price.  The Hard Rock Hotel's \"Pink Taco\" is a much better bet.  So far for me, virtually all the star power top chef eateries in LV have sucked.  What happens in Vegas should be left behind in Vegas.",

Don't hesitate to order at least 7-8 plates. Some of them are bite-size and others are great for sharing.

I got the carnitas tacos, two were good, the 3rd one was full of fat, not much meat, that was a disappointment. I could have sent it back but we were in a hurry. Who ever prepared the tacos, must have been blind to include all that fat. My wife had the spicy shrimp tacos, I tried one and they were tasty. Our server was really great, very personable. I thought the prices were a bit high but we are in Vegas, kind of on a short leash so we endured the expensive lunch.",

I had the carne asada quesadilla and it was below average. Flavor wasn't there at all. Large portion, but that really doesn't matter when it's not even palatable.  Border guacamole tasted just like bland avocados--again, no real flavor.  Sparkling white peach lemonade was absolutely disgusting. Tasted more like straight up sugar syrup with a hint of citrus. No peach at all. Drinking it made me want to rinse my mouth.  Seems like this place is meant for brunch, but after this awful experience, I wouldn't waste my money to give them another chance. Very below average experience, service was absent, and prices for bad food was a little painful.",

We also wanted mimosas and she suggested the bottomless so we can try different kinds and kept bringing us different varieties.  The lunch menu did look good but the brunch menu looked so good, we had to go with that.  It's basically small plates and you all share.  There's so much to choose from that Darlene said she will take control and bring us almost everything.  And she wasn't lying!!  We had so much food, we felt bad wasting stuff when we were getting so full!!!!  Everything was fantastic!!  The one thing that we thought would be good was the churro tots.  They were a bit underwhelming, but still good.    We were celebrating two birthdays and Darlene even \"sang\" to our table!!

Border Grill overlooks the grand Mandalay pool, specifically the river part.  However, it is not too noisy and you can still have a good meal conversation. The food choices are all Mexican.  We ordered the bean dip (delicious) and had a few plates of chips.  Yum!   As for drinks, the margaritas were solid and they have a good selection of Mexican beers (my fave being Modelo Especial). Service was very good. I would definitely come back if in Vegas.",

She was fantastic!The drinks were amazing and everyone loved the food. I hope to make it back to try more things and bunch!  Recommend: Any margarita, Kale Caesar Salad, the guacamole, anything with the beef brisket and the plantains were delicious. Really you can't go wrong.   Good vegetarian options, too.",

We had half of our party arrive late, drinks were ordered at all sorts of varying times, water had to constantly be refilled, we must have been such a pain! But it was all smiles from the staff, who were super attentive, made terrific recommendations, and handled requests seamlessly.  The food was really terrific. I think we had clean plates all around. I had the chicken enchiladas, which I devoured. Margaritas are well made and generous. And everyone went crazy over the salsas. We had a few vegetarians in our group and they seemed happy with their selections too.  I was super impressed and would definitely recommend dining here.",

Came for Sunday brunch at 11 am, only a few tables were occupied, but as more people started the 11am checkout, it filled up pretty quickly.   Located downstairs in the convention center of Mandalay Bay, a bit of a hike from the garage, but well worth it.   Nice open airy ambiance with a sort of a semi view of a pool. There's a patio, but on cold December day it wasn't very popular.  $34.99 per person gets you all you can eat brunch. Additional $10 gets you unlimited mimosas in like ten different flavors (or just champagne, which Is what I opted for).   You order tapas style plates, as many as you want at a time, but word of warning- they are no joke, these aren't small bites but full blown entrees.   We ordered skirt steak and eggs- amazing, cauliflower taquitos- delicious, eggs Benedict, breakfast fries, shrimp and grits, chorizo and egg tacos and were so stuffed, could not eat another bite for the rest of the day. Service was very quick and friendly, food came out lightning fast. Recommend to anyone looking for a brunch option.",

    "text": "We received great service from the host, but once seated the service just dropped off.  Our server was just unavailable. It took forever to get basics like silverware or water, and the chips/salsa were probably a good 20 minutes after we sat down.  We waited so long just to get our cocktails that we started playing the game, \"So...do we leave? Do you want to leave? Where would we eat dinner? I'm so okay leaving, I have no problem getting up and just going. Lets give it 3 more minutes? What time is it now...\" But then our cocktails were served and we felt we had to stay.  Mr R ordered a really good pork plate. I had the short rib enchiladas. They came alone, without any sides except for a few greens on top. It was all really good. I was very impressed with the kids menus - tons of options for $4-6 a plate. We ordered a $5 plate of the green corn tamale which came with rice and beans. The tamale reminded me more of a corn casserole - not my favorite (nor the favorite of my 18 month old, but he had spent an earlier part of the dinner sucking green salsa off his chips and eating crayons, so not sure his opinion should count).  The patio was beautiful and heated in December, it was a decent place - just not someplace I'd go again.",

    "text": "I stopped in with my partner for dinner recently before going to a retro 80's concert that Mandalay Bay was hosting. Having dined here once before, I was looking forward to coming back. The first experience was fantastic. This latest visit though was a disappointment.   We ordered the Empanada's as a starter, and they were amazing. Full of flavor, the filling had a soft, almost delicate texture while the outside had wonderful color!  For mains, my partner and I both ordered the chicken enchiladas. I suspected from the moment that the server put them in front of us that they had died in the window, and I was right. Only a couple of bites in and it was clear --they were stone cold and flavorless. I called the waitress over, and she apologized and offered to have them remade. But, as I mentioned, we were on our way to a concert and now didn't have time for that --even though we had sat down to eat an hour before the show. She offered to talk to her manager to see what could be done, and I truly believe that she was as disappointed in the situation as we were.   When the bill came, the manager, who never came over to the table to either apologize or inform us as to how he was making things right, had deducted a meager 15% from the check --a nominal fix for what was for us a huge and unnecessary disappointment.  This could've been prevented so easily: First, by whomever was expediting at the pass (assuming that anyone was), and second, by the server. If I can see that the food has died even before my plate hits the table, they can too.   I now have a better understanding of why, for so many years, I've seen Gordon Ramsay and other highly accomplished chef's push their teams as hard and as constantly as they do --standards, standards, standards. If that was the chef and/or server on my plate, then the chef and/or server didn't really seem to care about what they were serving me. They were just cranking it out, and I was next in line.  What a shame.  I won't hurry back.  ***UPDATE***  The manager has reached out to me personally in response to this review, and I greatly appreciate her earnest, professional and thoughtful follow-up. I will be giving the Border Grill another try based on this. Happy to do so. I've also updated my review from two to four stars to reflect this outreach. Thank you, Border Grill, for your response.",

Once we were seated, the water came to our table as did the chips.  Idk what it is about their tortilla chips, but they are delicious!  We ordered the spicy black bean dip..they were good but def not spicy at all! For entrees, we got the carne asada quesadillas and the wagyu beef tacos.  Both dishes were scrumptious.  Prices were pretty high for mexican food, especially coming from SD =P But it was worth it!  Pretty dark in the main dining area, but the light shining off the wall was bright..which made me squint.  But really, the meal made it 5 stars. I don't care for the ambiance.  Service was also good and tentative, in the perfect amount.",

Our server was one of the best servers I have ever had somewhere. While we were looking at the brunch menu, she suggested she could just get us started by ordering a few items while we decided specific items we wanted. A few minutes later our came the items she selected and ever dish was better than the last. When we ordered more, she got thm out timely and even brought some on her own. When we said we were full, she told us to sit a few minutes so we could make room for more! We never felt rushed or like we ordered to much which is the case so many times when it is all you can eat.   All the food was amazing. The most memorable was the has with fried egg. The meat was so flavorful I could have eaten this alone and given the restaurant 5 stars. I also loved the shrimp and grits, french toast, and pork belly with waffle. They kept our drinks full and took away plates that were empty quickly. This will be a regular stop on every Vegas trip from now on. I can't wait to try \"regular' menu items because if you can get that many dishes right, then the other stuff has to be good!",

I've had the best and the worst Mexican around from trips to Mexico and living in Phoenix for 6 years and they all taste fine (it is hard to mess up).  First of all let me say, this is not traditional Mexican.  This is upscale Tex-Mex with a side of Spain.  They have the usual things you'd expect like Chips & Salsa, Guacamole, Enchiladas, Taquitos and fried ice cream.  They also have things like Ahi Tuna Ceviche, Peruvian Ceviche and Brisket burritos.  I tried a bit off everyone's plate and I must say....everything was delicious.  Worth every penny.  The service was also top notch!  I'd shy away from the drinks here....overly sweet and far too expensive (even for Vegas)",

Suddenly a man at a table near us started complaining (loudly) about his meal. Our party tried to ignore his rant and enjoy our meal. The chips, guacamole and salsa were all pretty good. I enjoyed my mojito and my friend enjoyed the first few sips of her sangria (after awhile she said it was \"like licking a candle\"). During our drinks the man at the table near us continued to complain and we noticed that another table near us was speaking to a manager about a problem with their food. We ordered our entrees and our food appeared less than ten minutes later. Not a great sign. My husband ordered the shrimp and portions of the plate were cold. My friend ordered the pork and she said it was okay...not great. My vegetable enchiladas tasted a lot like something you could order at Chevy's. I'm fairly certain that the food was pre-made and just dumped on our plates. Overall, I'm bummed that we wasted a meal in Vegas on this place.",

We chose upstairs, patio, overlooking the pool.  The appetizer of pablano chili/potato was surprisingly spicey.  I feared indigestion later, but it never came, just the explosion of good enough taste to finish it off.  I had the skirt steak, medium and it came out perfect.  Slightlly charred around the edge, while it tasted like a rub, the waitstaff said it was a special marinate.  Regardless, virtually perfect as well as the side of corn and black beans.  My g/f's chili relleno was \"the best\"; delicate batter, smooth, melting cheese, fork tender and contrasted with green chili rice and tomato based rice, it was the perfect dish for her.  With no thoughts to diet, we capped off the dinner with chocolate/cinnamon/oreo cookie, almost like a cheesecake, but a lighter mousee-like pie, was, I hate to overuse the term, but \"to die for.\"  Can't say enough about the staff; attentive, informative, courteous and absolutely spot-on in EVERYTHING.  As a local, I can see revisiting to try more of the menu.",

The brunch is all-u-can eat and all you can drink mimosas.  Its not a buffet, there is actually a menu w/ 17 different items on it from tacos to empanadas to fresh fruit, eggs benedict, etc.. all the items are tapas so 1 person could literally eat the whole menu if he/she were hungry enough... I only made it through 10 items but was full beyond belief.  Each dish is unique, full of flavor, and just down right delicious (unlike many of the traditional buffets); the food also comes out fresh-er than under a heated lamp.  Our waitress was super nice; only I had the brunch, my wife/son ordered off their regular menu yet they took bites and shared some of my food.  The guava empanada was so good we actually asked if we could take one to go (and our waitress made it happen!)  I would totally go again and will probably plan on it, on our next trip to Vegas (I've been to Bouchon for brunch, and have to say Border Grill is much better in terms of food, choices, and value)!",

    "text": "If it were possible to award an eatery a negative value of stars, I would most certainly have given Border Grill a negative 10.   I arrived in the company of four other people, in the late afternoon after going to the Aquarium exhibit. We were all very hungry, and excited to get some Mexican food. We're from Texas, and thought it would be interesting to see how a Top Chef's award-winning Mexican food would measure up to the stellar Tex-Mex food to which we are accustomed.   Upon arrival, the hostess was cheery enough, if a bit of an airhead. After being seated, we waited a full five minutes before even being greeted by a server. Following a perfunctory greeting, we were brought chips and salsa (both lackluster and bland) and had to wait another 5 minutes for water. The waiter was nice enough, but seemed to be mostly unconcerned with giving us good service, or making a decent impression.  The menu itself was rather pricey. If you're at a place that charges $ 4.50 for a fish taco a la carte (with a tortilla the size of a drink coaster and an even smaller filet of Mahi Mahi), you know you won't be able to leave the restaurant without paying upwards of $ 25.00 per person/ per dish. The food is billed as \"Mexican\", but there were no True Mexican dishes on the menu. Everything seemed to be more Central/ South American.  Let me preface my actual food review by saying that we waited a grand total of 35 minutes for our food to arrive. I was to the point of trying to eat our waiter, who had already conveniently disappeared.   I ordered the chile relleno burger, with paprika seasoned fries, and a fish taco a la carte. I asked for the burger rare, because 1) it cuts down on cooking time and I was ravenous, and 2) I simply cannot stand an overcooked, rubbery meat patty.  The other members of my party ordered 1) crab nachos 2) beef nachos 3) avocado tacos 4) chicken caesar salad.  1) The crab nachos were adequate. For a self-proclaimed \"grill\" specializing in seafood, the meat was rather bland and tasteless, and were downplayed by the plethora of toppings heaped upon the actual chip. 2)The beef nachos were already limp when they arrived at the table. The meat was wholly bland, and the kitchen chose to under-employ cheese, making the overall nacho rather boring. 3) The avocado tacos were a great disappointment. As said by the consumer of the food, the idea of the avocado tacos was excellent, but the actual execution of the taco was underwhelming.  4) The chicken caesar salad was probably the worst thing served. You might be questioning how in the world a kitchen can mess up that which is essentially chopped greens and a simple meat fillet. Well, when your \"caesar dressing\" is the taste and consistency of mayonnaise, and is literally drenching the salad, you tend to look unfavorably upon the dish.  5) My chile relleno burger was probably the best thing served. The burger was cooked to my standard, and the chile relleno itself was decent, if a bit bland. The fries were the only really yummy thing served, and I'm not sure that's something a Mexican restaurant should be proud of.  6)The fish taco was terrible. The corn tortilla (while \"homemade\") was bland and too thick, and the filet of Mahi Mahi was too thick, overcooked, and bland. The guacamole tasted like something you could get at the grocery store, and was heavily salted.   The overall really shocking thing to me was the lack of seasoning. The chefs behind the menu are award-winning and famed, but don't know how to use simple seasoning on their food to make it palatable.   The bill wound up being over $ 150.00 (when the checkbook finally made it to the table), and we paid up, left a tip, and got the hell out of there. I wound up with gastrointestinal issues later on that night. If you're looking for good Mexican food, I highly suggest going elsewhere. To give you an idea of how deeply disappointing this food was, I would suggest going to Taco Bell instead. At least there, you're only paying $.99 for a taco, and the diarrhea is cheaper.",

I came for a early lunch hoping to snag a nice patio seat but quickly realized IBM and the Rodeo was in town and the restaurant was packed. I was forced to sit at the bar which doesn't bother me to much. I ordered one of there signature margaritas and the guacamole. Now as for the margarita, it sucked. Tasted like sugar water and defiantly not worth the hefty price tag they put on those \"Signature\" margaritas. One thing I hate the most is when bars feel the cup with ice to the very top so you get little drink. But anyways, onto the guacamole. Very fresh tasting and tasted like your normal guacamole. Nothing special nothing bad but a overall good dish!   I went with there Border Classics dish which consists of two green corn tamales, two plantain empanadas, and two chicken panuchos. The green corn tamales weren't bad but not good. Where do they get the green from? It was basically cream corn inside and very little of it. The two plantains were good. Filled with smashed black beans and poblano peppers with cotija cheese on top. Had a nice kick to it which I like. Not to much cheese which a lot of mexican restaurants seem to do. Next were the chicken panuchos which were my favorite. Loaded with citrus roasted chicken, guacamole, and pickled onions all on top of a black bean stuffed tortillas. Now I was a little confused because the tortillas were just plain fried tortillas. Where the heck are the black beans? Maybe a fairy came a long and took my green and my black beans. Hmmm. But they were still good. The chicken cooked perfect with a nice citrus tasted that was really good and not over powering.   Service was as good as you can get at a bar. Overall this place is nothing special and I think food network needs to keep some of there Chefs on TV and not in the kitchen.",

I was having lunch by myself at the end of a weekend with friends in vegas before heading to airport, and decided to hit Border Grill since I hadn't been there before and it was close (we stayed at THEhotel).    At the server's suggestion, I had the daily special chicken and fruit salad.   I had been thinking I was in the mood for more traditional mexican, but he spoke so highly of the salad that I went with his recommendation.   And, I was SO glad i did!   It had a great combination of flavors - peaches, nectarines, mangoes, black cherries, spicy sunflower seeds, marinated chicken, and boston lettuce all with an apricot jalapeno dressing.   YUM!    The service was also very attentive, with multiple folks checking up on me regularly.    It was only one experience, but based on that one time, I will certainly try it again next time I'm in vegas.   I hope they add that salad to their normal menu!",

The waiter we had was a bit arrogant or was trying to pull off the \"we're a high class restaurant\" vibe.  Oh well, he turned out to be a great asset and offered many suggestions.  I always appreciate when someone tells me what I should or should not order.   We also ordered the guacamole which was so good.  It came with a little salad with some sort of juice (lime). I appreciate when restaurants offer their own spin on a classic dish.  In regards to dinner, I ordered the chicken poblano enchiladas. They were amazing.  The tortillas were wrapped around the meat so tight which is cool. (I can never get my tortillas to do that at home -- amateur chef that I am).  The green sauce was great and was almost sweet but in a good way.  My one complaint is that there was so much sauce that I couldn't enjoy it without some chips.  No one had refilled our chips and looking back I should have asked for more.   All around, a great experience and a place I would come back too when I am in Vegas next.",

The brunch is served downstairs on the patio that is located next to Mandalay Beach so when the weather is perfect like it was this past weekend you can enjoy the elements and the food.   Every brunch starts off with the Chips & Salsa Trio.. all 3 salsas are great but the tomatillo is PERFECT. I wish I had read the review telling me to ask for the spicy salsa but I will save that surprise for my next visit.   We shared the following dishes:   Huevo Ranchero - Not my favorite dish, there was something about about the sauce that I wasn't fond of. BUT, the next item was great...   Breakfast Enchilada - This is not your typical rolled enchilada but it is a stacked version that was delicious. I would order this one again.   Coconut French Toast - This was the biggest surprise of the brunch. The coconut was not overpowering and the sourdough bread was perfectly cooked.   Biscuit and Sausage Gravy - Not much \"Mexican\" about this dish but the sausage gravy was great and the buttermilk corn biscuit was yummy.   Mini Breakfast Burrito, Chorizo and Egg Taco and the Carne Asada Taco - All were very good.   Machaca Chilaquiles - This was my FAVORITE dish of the day. I could have eaten a full sized order of this or multiple small sized portions. Chilaquiles is something that I am always on the look out for and once you add amazing beef brisket you get a dish that you will remember forever.   Overall the atmosphere, food and service were great and I would go back for this brunch anytime. If you are in Vegas or come to Vegas and don't try this brunch you might possibly regret it for the rest of your life...",

The salad was excellent! My fish tacos were a little bland, but the sides were good. The peach lemonade was so yummy that we ordered three glasses! Overall I was very pleased with their food and service. We would definitely come back for more!",

It's a good bet if you're looking for a nice place to have dinner, its a good mix of laid back/fancy.  The few times I've been here I've tried the fish tacos which are thoroughly enjoyable but probably not worth the 23 dollars they charge, the chicken enchiladas which are delicious but for 26$? But its the strip so what did I expect right... I've also had the the market veggie quesadilla which is tasty, cheaper, and a good choice if you're vegetarian.  Bottom line this place is worth a visit if you're in the area but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.  A lot of their reviews seem to be for their brunch so maybe that's where its at, to be honest they probably deserve 3.5 stars but oh well",

My dad and I started our meal off with guacamole, a pineapple mojito, and a peach margarita. As an entree my dad ordered the grilled fish tacos: it came with three tacos that were served in hand made corn tortillas and three different types of rice. I ordered a bowl of tortilla soup without cheese and also the tuna crude. My dad really enjoyed the dish and thought they were surprisingly light. I absolutely loved the tuna crudo. I am a True sushi snob and it has to be amazing for me to love it. This truly was unique, the combination between the fresh tuna, avocado, chipotle essence, and my favorite part toasted quinoa on top to add a bit of crunch. Words cannot describe how unreal it truly is. The soup also is something I highly recommend  as well, the base is very delicious with just a touch of heat added. The avocado in it adds a cooling factor to it though. Overall we were very impressed with this restaurant yet again. We shall be dining there again very soon.",

I am a super sucker for a super seafood taco and, after falling in love with Susan Feniger during my obsession with last season's Top Chef Masters, I couldn't wait to sample her cuisine while I was at a work-related event at the Mandalay this week. I wish Susan's cuteness and total cuisine inventiveness on Masters would have translated better on my plate. I went for the Spicy Shrimp tacos and couldn't have been more disappointed. The mini-corn tortillas on which the shrimp sat were soggy because they were overwhelmed with guac and other toppings, which didn't add to the dish's tastiness. The shrimp themselves were well-spiced... but were, unfortunately, served cold... as were the sides (the two types of rice on my plate were hard pellets and the almost-frozen pureed blackbeans were absolutely unappetizing). When I asked for a little hot sauce, Tabasco was bought to the table.... SERIOUSLY??!! I expect Tabasco at most restos... but not at Mex ones.... and especially not at this one.  Needless to say, I was a bit under-impressed.   Susan -- please come and save your resto in Vegas!!! There are so many of us that would love to love your place!!!",

It was the best dinner my husband and I had in Vegas during our stay.  This place would get 5 stars, but the customer service sucked. I think we saw our waitress a total of four times. One of the wait staff constantly bumped my partner's chair during our meal everytime he walked by. The server who brought our food out did not know which table it went to, and so he just kind of wandered from table to table as it was rejected by customers. Then, as I had just finished and my partner had just a few bites left, the server picks my plate up and then stands there staring at my partner waiting for him to eat his last few bites. My partner takes his sweet time to savor the last few bites, while this server is literally standing a few feet away watching my partner. WTF? I have never seen anything like that before, so yeah, customer service  was not hot.",

    "text": "This is more of a 1.5 star meal, and my lord this was one of the top worst dining experiences I have ever had.  There were a few good things, which is why I gave them two stars.  But the screwups were so bad, and even when the management was made aware of them and didn't really compensate us for it that I'm almost tempted to give them just one star for being so shitty.  So we came here because we were catching the Muse show just down the hall at Mandalay Bay Events Center.  We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate we wanted to use, and we had seen Susan Feniger on Top Chef Masters perform very well and thought that would translate into a good meal at her restaurant.  We ordered the following: Sangria Margaritas - was too sweet but ok Queso Fundido - was good but didn't like all the guac all over the place, and not enough cheese to call it a queso dish. Watercress, Avocado, and Orange Salad - loved this salad, nice and refreshing Fish Tacos - see below, these were awful Grilled Skirt Steak - one of the highlights of the meal  I want to specifically highlight that even though we ordered the queso fundido, the waiter did not actually order this dish for us, and accidentally ordered the beef sopes.  When we told the waiter there was a mistake and did not order the sopes, the waiter apologized profusely and said the manager of the restaurant was going to talk to us, insinuating that the restaurant would comp us for having to have us wait for them to make new appetizers.  She came up to us and apologized and said they were going to hurry with the fundido, but no comp.  We weren't sure why she bothered apologizing since the waiter did already.  Once we finally got our main courses, I had ordered the fish tacos which I had heard were some of the best in town.  I took a bite and they were stinky, fishy smelling, and bland.  I hated it.  I inspected the dish more and the fish did not seem to even be properly cooked, and the fact that it smelled made me question how fresh the fish was.  There was also supposed to be a crema on the tacos, but there was no crema here.  This dish was so bad, I actually complained to the waiter and the manager at how awful it was.  The manager actually tried to argue with me that the dish was fine.  Eventually, she took the dish and said they were going to remake it, but I didn't really want a remade dish, I just wanted to send it back and not get another because it was so bad.  However, they remade it, charged me for it anyhow. I had lost my appetite from the experience but took a bite to be polite, and it was better but I was too scared to put a good dent in it, thinking they were going to try to kill me with bad fish.  I took the rest to go and threw it away.   Anyway, we'll probably never go here again unless Susan Feniger herself calls and apologizes for such a crappy meal.",

    "text": "Border Grill stems from the Border Grill and Ciudad restuarant owners based in Santa Monica/LA.  There is a reason why another one was asked to open in Las vegas, same reason why any  other famous restuarant opens another flagship place in LV, bc it's DAMN GOOD.  Border Grill delivers.  I typically think mexican food is best served from a whole in a wall near the border with a questionably stolen grade A sign and full of grease fat and hot sauce.  However, this is one of the few upscale Mexican places I think pulls off delicous and unique yet tasteful dishes.  We got the sampler appeititizer which is the way to go if you want ot try a little bit of many things Border grill has to offer- including the famous Food Network's Too hot Tamales- which YES are very very good.  All the food is fresh and has a great upscale spin to the flavors.  Along with the view of Mandalay's pools, you sort of feel that you are smack in the middle of a Mexician riveria.    I think one major reason why I am SUCH a big Fan of Susan Feniger and her restuarants are the politics and community involvement she always has.  She doesn't just cook and make delicous food, but she is active in the food industry in its current revolution.  She makes an effort to be responsible to the enviroment and its resources by using organic or sustainble ingredients.  She is currently offering special priced dinner in LA where a portion of profits go to Scleroderma research.  She constantly offers moderate/affordable pricing to her food (like participating in Dine LA)- even in Vegas where every other restuarant is inflatted to Disneylandesque prices.  Best of all, she is an LGBT chef that always supports her local LGBT communties.   Ive never seen a chef so involved in her work that continues to care and give back.   It makes you feel like all she wants is to have her customers enjoy food and life as much as she does.",

The guacamole was worth the extra money but there wasn't any spice to the salsas with the chips. If there was an alternative available it was not offered. I shared the Peruvian ceviche and sweet corn tamales with a friend. I loved the plantain chips with the ceviche and thought it was very refreshing. The tamales had wonderful flavor but was so wet it had to be eaten with a spoon. For the entree we had the seafood chile relleno. The pepper was nice and crisp with a very flavorful filling. Over all it was a very nice atmosphere and good service. I would definitely come back.",

The guac was the only half decent thing we had, but at $9, it better be!   My husband and I both ordered tacos - me the carnitas, him the carne adasa. My carnitas were just ok - nothing special. He said his carne asada was the same.  The most shocking part for me was the rice. It was absolutely inedible. Both the red and green were completely dry tasteless. Completely awful.

    "text": "We visited Border Grill this past week while in Las Vegas for a quick family getaway.  We were there for dinner on a Thursday night, we had reservations. We have two teenage kids and found it odd instead of seating us in the main dining room, (with several empty tables) we were escorted down a flight of stairs to a large room.  There was a large party, as well as another family with one child.  Perhaps this is reserved for families?  Not sure.  We were seated in a corner, so not the best seating.  The hostess handed our teenage kids crayons and paper.  Kids were amused, but found it odd.  As far as the food, my husband enjoyed his skirt steak.  It was over-priced, but expected.  I ordered a caesar salad and the plantain empanadas.  The salad was stale, and mostly croutons.  Also stale.  The empanadas were good, but not great.  I think my son had the best meal.  He raved about the fresh tortillas with his burrito.  Service was also subpar.  Never saw the server.  Tried to find her at one point so we could get a refill on our tea.  We had a great experience (food & service) a few years back at Border Grill, this is why we returned.  After this experience, I do not think we will return.",

We came for lunch - we ate the Chicken Enchiladas and the Banana Leaf Wrapped Pork. Hands down, the best Enchiladas I have had. And the guac was yum yum yummy! We sat on the patio, overlooking to pools which was nice. The waiter was friendly and attentive. With the coupon, lunch came out to about $30 total - awesome! I would go again. :)",

Our server was forthcoming with recommendations and extremely sweet. The drinks were to die for delicious and our food was divine. I had a pork belly dish (the special - can't recall the name) and my mom had the Green Chicken Poblano Enchiladas. Both were delicious, though I slightly preferred the enchiladas. This was my first time at a Susan Feniger/Mary Sue Milliken restaurant and I was completely satisfied. I also loved that the restaurant overlooks the beautiful Mandalay Bay pool area.

    "text": "FOUR STARS?? Are you guys nuts? Do you know what a food blight Vegas is? Sure there's tons of restaurants here but what about real, eatable food that nourishes you and the planet? It's mostly Sysco/Monsanto palaces.  If you like to eat healthy quality food, in Vegas there isn't much to find. It's so refreshing to enjoy Borders fresh, sustainable, ORGANIC with plentiful vegetarian options menu. This is a HUGE find. I've seen the ladies who own this place highlighted on tv and have long wanted to eat at one of their locations based on their commitment to quality ingredients. It did not disappoint, not one bit. We're both excited, and have planned to go back again on this trip. Btw if you're here with a conventioneer, the location is great for meeting.  I sat on the patio and watched the river floaters while I waited a good 40 minutes for my husband to join me. They did not mind one bit. My waiter was perfect balance of checking in and leaving us be. I enjoyed a great creative blood orange margarita (customized to low sweetness, none of that green mix, just fresh juices) and munched a few of the fresh chips and salsa  (the salsa could be better) while I waited. It was so pleasant the time seemed like a moment until my husband joined me. The waiter came by pretty soon to get his drink order, but still there was no pressure to hurry. I've found some rushing at other spots here at Mandalay Bay. It's uncomfortable.  I ordered the plantain empanadas! I ate the luscious plantain and black bean empanadas! I will dream of them. Ok I don't dream about food but they are delish. It's an appetizer but plenty for lunch. My husband orders a chili rellano every single time we get Mexican food. He can't get enough. So we're pretty versed in the good and the bad of rellanos. We dislike the puffy puffy sloppy, greasy egg batter type. Borders isn't that. Oh it's egg but a nice thin, tasty almost crispy exterior. Boy did he love it! The rice and black beans were tasty tasty too, and since they have their organic sustainable vegetarian blurb right on the menu, I didn't have to quiz the waiter on lard or meat broths. Yep fresh clean eatable nourishing foods, done so well. We immediately decided we'd have our last lunch here too.  I think the reason this jewel has only four stars is that some folks aren't well really most folks aren't used to eating real, fresh, whole foods. That's a shame. What's been done to our food system by Monsanto is a terrible shame. It's a challenge to eat with nutrients in mind, but easy here disguised a California Mexican food. It's like sushi you feel so great after your meal instead of being bogged down.   I read they bring a green tamale sample if you do a yelp check in. I wonder how that works. I'm just geeky enough to try it. See you on the patio Thursday after check out, I'm sure I'll be there for two hours!  Baaack four days later enjoying another lunch in the shade. Kale salad was wonderful today (those cotija croutons are crisp niceness) and my husband's fish tacos perfectly cooked! And it is True if you help check in you do get a nice small green corn soft tamale which is delicious. Since I was early again waiting for my husband it was like a tiny breakfast course! Oh and we loved the bean dip though we couldn't finish it. Thanks Tiffany for another leisurely lovely lunch date!",

For $40, you can sample and eat through the entire brunch tapas menu like spicy chicken tamale and Peruvian shrimp & grits (if you're up for something more traditional) to crispy pork belly & waffles and a jalapeno bacon PB&J (for the more adventurous eaters). The chicken & waffles, steak & eggs, and eggs Benedict (because how can you not have a Benny on a brunch menu...) had cool Mexican spins on them that were as equally delicious as their dessert items like the Tres Leche Bread Pudding. I mean, come on!!! For $15-20 more, you can treat yourself to unlimited mimosas and such! To top it all off, the staff was super friendly, helpful, and even better than the warm guava empanadas they bring out before you even look at the menu!",

By some I literally mean 2/6 were cooked well and the others were garbage.   The churros are not even churros don't bother ordering it.    The tostada with chicken was the best of the bunch along with the guacamole. These were off the regular menu. Also off the regular menu was the grilled chicken torta: this had absolutely no flavor what so ever. I asked for hot sauce to attempt to mask the dullness with spice but I never received it and gave up.   Bloody Mary was tomato juice and just that with a lime thrown in.   Now. As far as service, oh boy! Our server was Tiffany M. Our party was of 10 people but we were pretty easy breezy with our orders. However, much of our side requests were constantly forgotten and when we asked for our checks she had us sit for 20 minutes and calculate everyone's orders instead of her charging each individual. She was rude about it as well, as if she didn't know how to do calculations herself. What kind of service is that?   Wouldn't come back here. You're better off elsewhere.",

They had a Border grill tapas style brunch for $38 plus bottomless mimosas for $15 if you're down...the tapas wee unique in that they could cater based on diet. We had a pescatarian, non ham eater, and a normal eater . They also offered a fresh salad as part of the deal. All courses were brought out plate by plate and the group overall really enjoyed their food. The service was good and our server let us pick what to eat and when. Overall a good choice outside of your normal Vegas Buffett and food served was gourmet and delicious. Enjoyed the green corn tamales, Peruvian shrimp and grits, and chilaquiles were my favorites. Mimosas were worth it and brought out at a good pace to balance the meal. Overall, most definitely worth a stop if you're in Vegas and looking for a variety type of brunch menu.",

    "text": "My local friend and I came here during restaurant week (last week). We each had the 3 course tasting menu, which by the way, is on the regular menu but is marked up $8 additional during restaurant week. They say it's because $4 goes to a children's charity, which is great, but what about the other $4?  I had the mushroom empanadas, the shrimp enchiladas in \"lobster sauce\", and the only dessert option which was some dark chocolate cookie sandwich (whoopie pie) and some cinnamon cream (?horchata). My friend had tuna tartare (more like a a hawaiian poke) and the steak.   Food: Where do I begin? Oh I know...umm yes, the food was disgusting!! I'm sorry, I never like to say something like this, but both us felt the food was absolutely horrible. I even took home my leftovers and tried to eat them later, but I couldn't. I had to throw them away, and I don't usually throw food away. The flavors were completely off, did not compliment each other at all, and were very unbalanced. They have a sign outside saying this is the most authentic Mexican food. That could not be further from the truth. It seems as if the chef is trying very hard to create gourmet dishes, but ended up creating very very pretentious dishes that did not taste good at all. Whoever is in the kitchen does not appear to know how to work with ingredients and flavors.   The Hawaiian-poke-style tuna tartare: very very strong flavor of dark sesame oil and soy sauce. Sesame oil is a strong flavor, and is supposed to be used lightly. The chef dumped it onto the tuna as a sauce. Same with the soy sauce.  Mushroom empanadas: The three small pieces were fried, but the crust was chewy and almost stale tasting, instead of crispy. The filling had almost no flavor. The sauce made of black beans, also had no flavor.   The shrimp enchilladas: Very salty, but flavorless. The filling had a fishy taste, which I didn't expect for shrimp, but otherwise had no flavor. The tortillas had a soft, doughy texture that was more like cornbread. The sauce was a pretty shade of orange, but tasted like salty cream, no real flavor at all.  The dessert: This was absolutely the worst dish. Neither of us could eat it. The stuffed cake/cookie thing was stale and had a strange chewiness. It was a very very dark chocolate and had almost no sweetness at all. The cream filling was sort of hard, not creamy, and did not taste sweet or good. The accompanying cinnamon horchata was ok, but very strongly cinnamon-flavored, and nothing else, not sweet.  I cannot comment on the steak, because I don't eat beef.  Right after I left Vegas, I read an article about the chef/owner, Susan Feniger, in Westways magazine. The article presented her as doing innovative things with authentic Mexican food, which is something I would be interested in trying. I was very disappointed that I had such a poor experience. To be fair, the article was about the (original) Santa Monica location, which hopefully might be better, and I would be willing to give it a try.  Prices: Ridiculous! I know it's Mandalay Bay, and it's also a \"gourmet\" restaurant, but even so, the prices were way over the top. My plate of two enchilladas (with NO accompanying beans or rice or anything) would be $27 if a la carte. The cheapest entree was an a la carte chile relleno, which was $19. Our three-course menus are normally $42. However, the exact same menu was bumped up to $50 for restaurant week. When we asked why the price was elevated, we were told that $4 per person is donated to a children's charity during restaurant week. That does not account for an $8 price increase.   Ambience: It's ok, like a typical four star Mexican restaurant. The patio seating overlooking the pool is nice.   Service: This is the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one. Our server, Kelly, was very friendly, accommodating, very attentive, and just overall amazing. She was very pushy in the beginning trying to make us order more items, but other than that, it was some of the best service I've had.   PROS: Service, location in Mandalay Bay  CONS: FOOD (very poorly executed, bad taste); price  BOTTOM LINE: Something seems to be lost in translation between the chef owner who is in California, and the staff of this Vegas location. The food is horrible!",

Hubby finished early so we decided to go to the restaurant and see if we could get seated earlier than our 9p reservation.  It would take our friend a little while to get there so we sat at the bar and ordered a Border Shaker for Two.  Our cocktail waitress was very friendly and shortly after we ordered the bar got pretty crowded.  We were at a table and enjoyed our order.  It was so tasty that I was actually wondering if there was tequila in the drink as it was not noticeable at all.  Hubby did get quite buzzy, so that answered my question.  The shaker for two comes with two cocktail glasses, a shaker, a small bottle of tequila (enough for two shakers-full) and an extra glass with the other margarita ingredients.  The shaker contains the first round of the margarita mix and the tequila is added at the table before it's shaken (without a top).  When you're ready for round two, pour the second batch of mix into the mixer and add the rest of the tequila.  Note, the first round only had about a third of the tequila in it and the second round was too much to fit into the mixer.  We actually had to pour the tequila into our cocktail glasses.  Well worth the $29!  Our friend arrived and we were able to be seated an hour earlier than our 9p reservation time.  We were seated outside and even though it was still in the 90s, the sun had set, there was a breeze and it was actually quite comfortable.  Water was poured and chips with three types of salsa were brought to the table.  The chips are very light and crispy and appeared to be flour tortillas versus the traditional corn tortillas.  There is a red salsa, a green salsa and a chipotle salsa.  All three are good, but the smokiness of the chipotle easily made it my favorite.  The green came in a close second and the red seemed a bit pedestrian, possibly for the non-adventurous.  We ordered:  Blood Orange Margarita - for our friend Corn Chowder (on the special's menu) - for our friend Ceviche Trio (Peruvian, Baja, Tuna Credo) - for me and hubby Chicken Poblano Enchiladas - for our friend Gaucho Steak - for hubby Tecate Carnitas - for me  The Ceviche Trio arrived first and it is a small sampling of the three different types of ceviche listed on the menu.  The trio is not listed, but our waitress informed us that we could do any combo of any of the ceviches.  We opted for the trio so we could try them all.  The Tuna Credo wasn't very exciting.  The seasonings weren't prominent enough and tasted pretty bland.  The Peruvian and Baja were a little more flavorful.  Hubby enjoyed the Baja the best and my favorite was the Peruvian.  All three had large amounts of fish (and shrimp in the Baja), but the portions are probably only large enough to share between two people.  Our friend had the corn chowder and he said it was very tasty, albeit a bit spicy.  He enjoyed the kick to it, though, and finished the entire bowl.  Our entrees arrived and all three were generous portions.  Our friend enjoyed his enchiladas and finished them.  Hubby ate about half of his steak which he really liked.  It was served over a bed of what appeared to be \"chilaquiles\", but he said it was a little odd.  My carnitas were excellent!  The presentation was pretty interesting as well, with the black bean salsa layered with what the corn grits above and then finished with a huge pile of carnitas, jalapeno bacon and onions.  A singular large flour tortilla accompanied.  I was only able to eat about a third of the meal and I was full.  Hubby and I both took our leftovers back to the hotel and had them the next day.  Still good!  It's been awhile since I'd been to the Border Grill and it was nice to have another experience to remind me why I enjoy this restaurant.  The staff and service were excellent and the generous portions of the tasty food don't hurt, either!",

We sat up stairs outside, being from the east cost and coming to vegas in the Winter time and being surrounded by palm trees was amazing.  The food blew my mind. Was the best food I have ever had. The desert was even better, believe it or not . I am not a huge desert person, but wow did it blow me out my seat. It was amazing and by far my favorite place to go to now when I spend time in vegas. Loved it, and they had a locals discount, extra points for them! Loved it, if you are debating on going , don't debate anymore. GO! You will not regret it!!",

It was 20 bucks and some change for the AYCE brunch add another 5 for their AYCD champagne.  I don't remember all of what I got because it seemed like I got it all. Definatley get the Coconut french toast.   Can't make up your mind??? Just ask your server.  She was so nice and attentive.  I asked her to bring out whatever was the most popular and she did exactly that... and kept it coming, AND COMING, AND COMING.  Never the same dish twice unless I asked for it... like the french toast.  I had my sister at the table who ordered off the regular menu who forced me into ordering a few items for her because she was JEALOUS!  Dishes are served in small portions and rightly so! I had to take a togo box (unheard of for AYCE, right?) BOMB!",

For me the atmosphere (inside dining room) was depressing, everything in shades of gray, along with the remote location with little foot traffic kind of lulls you into thinking \"I really don't feel like i'm in Vegas anymore...zzz\".    That said the food is pretty good, the flavors and sauces are sophisticated, as one would expect from the well known chef owners.  Beware of the salsas on the table, two of the three were pretty hot, and I typically like spicy food.    We noticed a new location for Border Grill in the Forum Mall, this will be an welcome improvement, look forward to trying this location when it's completed.  I'll give it another chance.",

I understand that service suffers when they are busy but they were barely at half capacity. With so many great brunches in Vegas to choose from this one is ok. I give it a \"meh\"",

The service was pretty friendly and we started out with the chips and salsa. The salsa wasn't very spicy. We then ordered the Guacamole and that was delicious! So addicting!  For my main dish I went with the skirt steak. It came cooked medium rare, purple refried beans, corn salsa, and flour tortillas. The meat was very good. The beans were nice as well. A good clean texture. The corn salsa was whatevers.. It didn't do it for me with the lack of sweetness. The flour tortillas didn't taste like much.   My buddy got the carnitas plate.. OH my goodness! That was a hit. The carnitas with the cheese, beans and rice WHOOO!!! I definitely recommend getting that dish.  Recommendation:  Carnitas plate and guacamole for the chips.",

If you're in LV and want a good fish taco go to Border Food Juarez/El Paso at 412 N. Eastern.  You get real fish (not some rectangular deep fried hunk), lightly floured/fried & served with all fresh ingredients.  I would eat here every day if it were closer to my house.  If you're in LV and want good tortilla soup get in a car and drive 8 hours to the bay area of CA and go to Una Mas.  They take a delicious broth, add chunks of GRILLED chicken, SPOON IN fresh pieces of avocado, and sprinkle it with grated cheese & fresh strips of tortillas.  They assemble each bowl to order.  Best tortilla soup EVER.    One thing I'd definitely get if I went back to Border Grill is a drink that went past me on a tray.  I have no idea what it was but the glass was trimmed with toasted coconut and it looked great.  UPDATE 2016: I went back the spring of 2016 & ordered fish tacos again.  They came with grapefruit on them!  GRAPEFRUIT?!? And not just any kind, but the sweet pink kind.  FYI grapefruit on a fish taco is awful :(",

At first glance I really liked the decor and ambiance of this spot.   The hostess was pleasant and that is where the good service ended!    It was a slow Monday night so you would think the service would be stellar since our waitress had three possibly 4 tables. She did quickly greeted us and took our drink order and then disappeared for what seemed like forever, realistically 15-20 minutes, but that is a long time when you are in need of an excellent margarita and some yummy Mexican food.   Our waitress was then absent nearly all of our meal with someone else refilling our waters and delivering our food.   Our drinks were okay however weak, particularly for the price. They charge for tap water?? Really that is simply strange. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos since I like spicy food and I was fairly dissatisfied with them. The portion was small and they forgot the spice! A label saying medium shrimp tacos would of been more appropriate. My friend ordered the Kobe beef tacos and was equally disillusioned with the portion and she said were unusually salty and dry.     I expected better quality food and service for the price ($97 after tip for two entrees and some drinks).  There are too many nice Mexican locations in Vegas so I am putting Border Grill on my \"Skip It\" List.",

    "text": "Ok... I have mixed feeling about this place.... I really do..  This came on a recommend and it wasn't bad... but it wasn't knock-your-socks off either.  There are a few things I didn't appreciate, and that tainted the whole experience there.   For one, when the tortilla chips and salsa came, the guy asked us if we wanted any gucamole to accompany the chips, and we said ok... not realizing that they were going to charge us for it, seeing as that we had just sat down ad were getting our bearings.. It wasn't until we open the menu and saw that guacamole was on the appetizer size of the menu that we realized that there was a charge.   I'm just saying it would have been nice, if they asked us if we wanted the guacamole and tell us that there was a charge for it, rather than say you want the guacamole, here you go and find out that they charge $ for it at the end of the meal. We might have ordered it anyways, but I really really really really hated the way they were sneaky about that.   I was prepared about the water charge $0.50 per person, but once again they didn't ask us about that, but luckily I was prepared for the diming of us there and so didn't mind so much.   Service is attentive, but I would like to know that service staff was more ... communcative with each other. I mean one guy knows we ordered dessert and puts a pair of forks and napkins on the table for us, so when our dessert comes we can share; two minutes later another waiter comes by and tries to take it away... I mean really seriously.... I appreciate the attentiveness, but at least communicate with each other...  *exhales* The restaurant itself was ok; but these issues that I mentioned above really ruined what otherwise would have been a good experience here. I appreciate how they are trying to go local, and organic and be responsible about sourcing their food, etc. But there are ways to around it, that don't make the restaurant, and by extention the owners/chefs look like complete ***** in the process.  Food was good. I recommend the Border Grill experience and we thought the braised short rib was better than the fish tacos, and their Tamarind Ginger Cheesecake was amazing. The fact that I made a reservation on Opentable and they had our reservation and table ready when we walked in was nice., Front of house was efficicent, but like I said in regards to the issues I listed about...  If you do decide to come here, I suggest the outdoor seating, but make sure there isn't a large party out on the balcony; otherwise it is a mite too noisy to enjoy the company you are with.   Border grill does not meet my Las Vegas Recommend must-visit List.",

Extremely flavorful & perfect temps & presentations we ordered the Confit Duck Chilaquiles & Carne Asada Quesadilla The chilaquiles were perfect, layered well, with bountiful amount of ingredients & heated throughout, duck was flavorful & tender The quesadilla was full of ingredients & crispy. perfectly cooked & delicious we were full because we ate every single bite but we wanted to at least taste the dessert & take some home - our server(who was phenomenal) bought us dessert. we opted for the Pastel Rufina - puff pastry with cream cheese chocolate chunks & fresh berries - we took one bite & realized we were not leaving until we finished EVERY bite...needless to say -it was over the top & extremely delicious. Our server went above & beyond for us & treated us very sweetly & gave us awesome service Thank you Border Grill, for making our special day, even more so",

    "text": "I came to Border Grill while I was on vacation a couple weeks back. I'd found a list of the 10 best brunch spots in Vegas, saw they had one with a Mexican/Spanish influence and booked a reservation. Initially I wanted to come because of the bottomless mimosas but after a very long and trying Friday night instead I ordered a 'refresher.' Note: refreshers are the best hangover helpers around. I was with four other girls and we had the best waitress ever, whose name I wish I could remember! I just remember she had medium length dark brown hair and knew everything about the food. She ordered a few things on the menu for us to get everything started. All in all everything we had was fabulous. We had: churro tots, fruit, home fries, pastor taco, tamale, shrimp and grits, biscuit and gravy, lobster pancake, quesadilla.... and so much more I can't remember. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of were the biscuit and gravy.  If you're in Vegas, check it out! This place is definitely worth a trip. Ask to sit on the patio so you can look out on the pool.",

    "text": "I love unique flavor combinations that are not overpowering.  Most of the dishes have a unique ingredient that gives it a new twist, without taking over the traditional base.  My favorite dish by far here is the Baja Ceviche.  It inspires me to make my own ceviche at home every time i have it.   A delicate blend of fish, shrimp, red onions, tomato, avocado and a fresh cilantro sauce drizzled over.     My other favorites from prior visits are the empanadas and the sweet green mini tamales.  Last night I had the chicken poblano enchiladas.  Let me say I have been craving green enchiladas for about 6 months.  I loved the chicken filling and loved the addition of thinly sliced portobello mushrooms, corn, nopal and poblano on top,  BUT there was WAY too much Green sauce, drowning some of the awesome flavors.  Would have been much better with a drizzling of the green sauce and the addition of some melted white cheese.  After all it can't be great enchiladas without lots of cheese.     My husband had the carnitas,  which were delicious.  Again unique ingredients added a twist,  bacon, citrus and a bed of polenta underneath.  His flour tortilla was the yummy authentic type.    My other favorite last night was the CABO RITA, mmmmmm,  pear puree in a  margarita made with fresh lime juice and agave,  versus sweet and sour and triple sec.   One of the best margaritas I've ever had.    Sadly the service SUCKED.  Our waitress never once came to check on us.  We had to wave her,  or the busboy down every time we needed something.  It even took 20 minutes just to get and process the check and we had to ask 3 times to move it along.   Also, sadly, when we made the reservation, they promised a pool view booth which was not available when we got there.  there was a front pool view table, which we said we would take, but it was \"reserved\"  to make a big table for a future reservation.   When we left, it was occupied by another couple, not  a big table.   Being lied to doesn't make the guest feel appreciated.   Had it not been for the service and the over abundance of green sauce, and the slight overprices,  I would rate 5 stars. The awesomeness of the Ceviche and the Margarita, raise it from 3 stars to 4.    If you like unique tastes,  I would still recommend.     The night was capped beautifully by a fun shopping excursion at my stores, Misura, Paradiso and Ruby Blue near the valet entrance!",

And she's had a lot of steak.   My mom's half chicken?  Moist and flavorful.  My kobe beef tacos were delicious.  The carnitas were a bit dry, but the flavor was good.  We were too full for dessert.

I ordered the unlimited tapas brunch as well as the bottomless mimosa. Each mimosa was different with a different type of juice, not similar to your regular orange juice and champagne. They were all very good. The tapas as well as the guacamole were very good. Some of my favorites where the steak and eggs, Peruvian shrimp and grits, and the stuffed waffles.",

    "text": "I couldn't agree more with the opening line of Sandy N.'s review of Border Grill:  This restaurant IS \"a must when visiting Las Vegas.\"  Ever since my first visit to this location in Mandalay Bay in '05, I've made sure to visit every chance I have when I'm in Vegas.  Located in the restaurant wing of Mandalay Bay, it's definitely a trek to get here, but totally worth the trip (if you get to the Shark Reef you've walked too far.)  I would recommend making reservations, but it's not necessary.  Upon our arrival, the hostess was very friendly, polite, as well as courteous, and promptly showed us to our table.  After having 1-2 minutes to briefly look over the menu, our server arrived at our table greeting us, and asked for our drink orders.  Well, as you might have guessed there are a fair selection of drinks with Mexican/Spanish roots on the menu, but my friend and I choose a drink special that evening:  the Cranberry mojito.  Priced at a Vegas-reasonable $9.00, it was a definitely a cool and refreshing start to our meal.  To start, we ordered the fresh house guacamole.  YOU MUST order the guacamole should you choose to dine here.  Not ordering the guacamole would be a travesty on your part.  It would be something like vacationing in Vegas but NOT gambling.  Ok enough said.  I should mention that there are complimentary chips and salsa with your meal as well.  The chips come with 3 types of salsa:  roasted pablano, tomatillo, & red jalapeno.  In addition to our guacamole, we decided to split a chicken empanadas from the appetizer menu.  This was served with pumpkin mole` and apple salad.  So delicious and just wonderful overall.  For dinner, I decided to order the chicken enchiladas, while my friend decided on a special for that evening, the turkey rienos with mole sauce.  I would have to admit that after sampling my friend's food, I would say I liked his much better than mine.  Don't get me wrong, my chicken enchiladas were delicious, a great dish overall.  It's just that I thought my friend's dish was well.....just better.  Needless to say, we both were very satisfied with our food and finished every single morsel on the plate, even most of the sauce was gone.  Just vanished.  2 dinner entrees and 2 cranberry mojitos later, we were 2 satisfied but stuffed customers!    SERVICE:  Terrific.  Wonderful.  Phenomenal.  Excellent.  I could think of more adjectives but I think you get the picture.  The service was some of the best I've ever experienced in Vegas...ever.  Our server was just so \"on it\" the entire evening.  And when we mentioned that this wasn't our first time dining here, she said something to the effect of thanking us for choosing to dine here again.  After a wonderful meal, she provided us with a complimentary sorbet for dessert.  Now THAT was the icing on the cake.  Fantastic service.  Bottom Line:  Make sure to head to Border Grill to experience some of the best Mexican food and customer service Vegas has to offer.  You won't be disappointed.",

The unlimited cook-to-order mini plates (that are still a lot of food) are full of bold, unique, southwest inspired flavors and are all available for one set price of $34.99.  We signed up on the website for the free VIP club and immediately received a coupon for a Buy one get one free entree which really lowers the cost of the brunch.  They have recently changed the menu to offer some new brunch options including some amazing pigs in a blanket and bbq brisket sandwiches.  They also changed the recipes on some of the favorites to give them a different flavor as well.  A common theme was manchego cheese and spicy avocado sauce.  We were very happy with all of the options because all of the flavors are just so unique.   The service was impeccable.  We had the pleasure of having Carmie as our server and she was very attentive, was able to anticipate our needs, and the food came out at perfect intervals.  We chose to have our brunch with water and coffee and the coffee was great.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, and more specifically the brunch, to anyone.  Carmie also informed us that they've added a similar all-you-can-eat tasting on the dinner menu all week as well.  We can't wait to give that a try.",

    "text": "We stopped in the Border Grill for lunch after our trek to the Shark Reef. Quick review: if you know anything about how Mexican (or even Tex/Cali Mex) should taste, don't eat here.  The restaurant is contemporary, while not as large as many other strip restaurants, it was a good size and relatively busy, even at an off time. The service from the waiter we had was good.   The chips and salsa were not bad. I preferred the tomato over the chipotle flavor, and the tomatillo offering was pretty good as well. The chips were warm and tasty.   I ordered the chicken quesadilla, my husband steak nachos. Neither of us considered our entrees to be edible.   The chicken in my quesadilla was grey and gristly. The cheese, described as \"manchego, panela, cotija cheeses\" was dry and crumbly. Unsure how any kind of cooked cheese maintains such a texture. Even though the tortillas were rather good,  I could not stomach more than one bite.   My husband's nachos were also unappetizing. The steak was rubbery and he was unimpressed that the sauces were out of a squeeze bottle. The cheese are described simply as \"mexican\" for this dish, but were the same dry, crumbly variety that were in the quesadilla.   We spoke to the waiter about or dissatisfaction with the meal and he removed the plates. A manager came by and asked what was wrong with them and after our explanation, told me the chicken was grilled Mexican style (which is why it was grey?) and that they use Mexican cheeses, but they serve more Americanized Mexican food.",

The dishes were very innovative and I appreciated the different flavors. I especially liked the bacon jalapeno pbnj sandwich! I really didn't think it was going to be good, but the hot/sweet/spicy/salty combo was almost addicting.  I also really liked the sweet corn tamales. They were full of sweet corn and very moist.  Lastly, I can't forget to mention the bottomless mimosas! My favorite was the cucumber mimosa. I tried grapefruit, apple and pom, but cucumber won (another flavor combo I was not expecting!) I recommend coming for brunch and bringing a large group to share dishes. We had so much fun and stayed for almost 2 hours laughing, eating and drinking. A wonderful Sunday!",

    "text": "For brunch on our last day in Vegas, we opted for the AYCE brunch at the Border Grill at the Mandalay. Although it is an AYCE brunch, the format is not that of a brunch buffet.  You can order as many tapas sized plates from the menu as you want.  The restaurant recommends ordering 3 per person.  We ended up ordering approximately 5 per person, but probably only ate 3-4 as some were misses that we didn't finish.    When you arrive, plates of cut fruit and guava and cheese empanadas are quickly set on the table.  Simple appetizers as they are, they were some of the best things all day.  The fruits included a spear of pineapple, a few of watermelon, honeydew, and a few slices of strawberry with a passionfruit puree.  The fruit and empananadas were a great start to the meal.  The fruit was sweet and the puree was very complimentary.  I loved the light, flaky crust of the pastry and the guava jam was delicious.    The absolute best dish of the day were the steak and eggs over a crispy potato cake.  Hot steak, crispy potatoes, egg yolk, guacamole = perfection.  Also good was the sweet corn tamale, which was subtley sweet with kernels of yellow corn inside and offset by the bright pico de gallo and the cool sour cream.  The Shrimp and Grits was also popular with its spicy sauce.   Some of the other dishes didn't fare as well.  The chicken enchiladas and the chilaquiles were clearly pre-assembled and had been reheated but not to optimum temperature.  They were barely warm as compared to the hot seared steak and hot steamed tamale, above.  The flavor of the enchiladas were okay but it just wasn't hot enough and with the chilaquiles, the chips were totally soggy.   Some dishes were just imbalanced.  The short rib hash with yams were overly sweet from the yams.  The PBJ biscuit with bacon, PB & J tasted exactly what you might think it would, and the eggs benedict had a bit of clashing flavors with the yucatan pork, marinated red onions and hollandaise.  Also, everything was served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Lovely condiments, generally, but it was tiring to see them so overused.    We had little room for dessert so we asked for more fresh fruit and shared one order of the Churro Tots.  These are more like mini doughnuts rolled in cinnamon and sugar but I must admit they were nicely fried and light.    All in all, it's a good brunch concept but the food isn't perfect.   Reflecting on everything we tried, it was hard to overlook the combination of the lukewarm pre-assembled food and the not quite natural assemblage of American and Latin flavors.  If you were to come, stick with the Steak & Eggs, Shrimp & Grits and some of the more standard Mexican fare.",

    "text": "Border Grill is an oasis of calm amidst the hustle and bustle of Mandalay Bay. In need of a gluten free lunch during the AWEA Windpower conference, I found this charming spot near the convention center, grabbed a seat at the bar, and proceeded to relax and let the excellent staff take care of me for the next hour.  Almost everything on the menu is or can be made gluten free. The chips and salsa are a nice way to start your meal, and I washed them down with a hand-muddled traditional mojito. Delicious!  The bartender recommended the Border Classics for my meal. This tasty sampler plate is a good way to try a little of the Mexican-inspired menu. You get two chicken tacos, two plantain empanadas, and two green corn tamales. I enjoyed every single bite. Highly recommended, even if you don't have a gluten allergy.",

Carnitas was by far the best but they were all delicious. Boyfriend had the chicken poblano enchilada and they were amazing. I believe our servers name was Karmen and she did an amazing job. Friendly, personable and knowledgeable. I will definitely be going back next time I'm in Vegas!",

I don't like eggs so that usually limits my brunch options but here I found plenty to eat and enjoyed it all. You don't go to the buffet here, you order from the waiter and they bring you your items. They also have an area where you go up and grab salad, parfait, and a shrimp cocktail type of thing, this is perfect for when there it a long wait for your food. The cinnamon roll pancakes, shrimp n' grits, and beef sliders really stood out but I enjoyed everything. I had a bloody mary with A-1 sauce in the drink, I wasn't sure how it would be but really enjoyed it and it was a unique taste compared to a usual drink. One warning is for some reason service can be uneven and water refills can be hard to come by so be prepared to flag your waiter down if needed. Oh, and if you go to their website you can sign up for a buy one get one free coupon good on anything including the all you can eat brunch.",

From our wonderful waitress Autumn, who set the tone for the night, to the GM Justin who had convinced me to give Border Grill another chance & made us feel so welcome when we arrived, to Chef Mike who personally delivered our desserts, and the rest of the staff who continuously checked to see how things were going.  I can't say enough now about how wonderful this place can be!  The food was mind-blowing, literally, we had the Grilled Skirt Steak & the Yucatan Pork. All my boyfriend could say was \"why\" & \"how is this possible.\" I really want to thank the staff for taking the time to show us that they do care about customer service!  We will be going back soon to try out the weekend brunch!!  See you soon!!",

    "text": "You really need to read this. It's a bit long. But, please hang in there. It's worth it. I was amazed by their concern for my issue. I am permanently disabled and walk with a cane with constant pain. I was walking from the convention center and food court area to the casino. I was stopped by a security guard at the Border Grill due to some ongoing floor reconstruction. Rather than telling me where I could pass, I had to ask the guard, \"Where do I go?\" She sat there on her wide butt and pointed to a steep long staircase headed downward. It should have already been quite apparent to her that I was in no condition to maneuver those steps. I then asked her how could I get down there, alluding to my obvious disability. She went on and on about an elevator, a walkway downstairs, and an escalator. But her description was unclear as it was obvious that she couldn't care less about my issue.  After about 10 or 15 minutes of wandering around trying to find where to go, I finally ended up finding a hotel employee who helped me find my way. It was a LONG walk around. No reason existed for me to even have gone down that long hallway in the first place. No signs were posted, no detour was shown. Just, \"Good luck, disabled folks! You don't matter!\" I was furious. This was not right. So, as I entered the area that finally got me downstairs below the restaurant, I told the security guard I saw about the problem. He told me to go tell the Manager at Border Grill. So, I did. Here's where my day was brightened.   I approached the Manager, who was at their \"Back Door\" entrance. I told her the whole story. She seemed very concerned. However, I still wasn't feeling as though they were going to make any changes or improvements. So, I specifically asked that they find a way to divert the folks who have mobility issues so they can not go through what I just went through. She looked me right in the eye and said she'd handle it. Then, she asked if I wanted lunch. I told her, \"No, I'm just walking through getting a little exercise. I just wanted to be sure nobody else has to go through that\" She again offered me lunch and a drink, almost pulling me inside the restaurant. So, I accepted her kind offer.   Now to the food! LOL. I had some chips and salsa (three kinds: two red, one green) and guacamole to start. It was delicious, and had good spices. I also had a \"Mexican Mojito,\" which really kicked some butt. Then the chile relleno burger came. OMG - just look for yourself - I posted a photo here. Not only was it ridiculously huge, it was awesomely delicious as well. The fries were skin-on and fried just right, too. I barely got through half the plate. But, I did finish that drink! All-in-all a great meal. Comfortable porch-like atmosphere downstairs, too. I wasn't even aware that the Border Grill had a downstairs until this. Great service, great food, and now the best part.   The manager (I wish I remembered her name!) came back to me near the end of my meal. She told me they are using their in-house elevator to divert disabled people around the construction. This eliminated a very long walk around that mess. Now, they can just go into the restaurant, take the elevator, and be where they need to be to get to the casino. Viola - problem recognized AND resolved within the time it took me to half-eat my free lunch. Now, THAT'S real service. They didn't have to do any of that. They could have just said, \"OK\" and left it at that; which is what I expected considering the first person (stupid lazy guard) I dealt with on this issue. But, that lady made my day. Not for the free lunch. I wasn't even that hungry. But for the kindness and consideration she had, and for having implemented an immediate fix. I'm impressed. Great job! Great food! Great service! Thanks!",

We ordered guacamole for the table, and it was fairly good. Service, on the other hand, was absolutely awful. The waitress didn't refill my water, and did not bring more tortilla chips even after we asked three times. I tried to order horchata, and they don't serve it. You call this a Mexican restaurant?  For my entree, I ordered a sampler of three ceviches. They weren't bad, but the portion sizes were tiny, and I had no chips to eat them with. I finally got fed up and just forked the stuff into my mouth and got out of there are fast as I could.",

I had the poblano enchiladas... kinda of dry... nothing special. Other people at my table had similar uninspired food.  The location is poor, down a convention center hallway away from the action and the people watching. The patio overlooks the pool but during the summer it is hot as balls... and that kinda of defeats the purpose. The rest of the inside decor is blah  The real problem with this place is it is an absolute terrible value. Not the worst Mexican food but priced like a fine dining establishment with average food and decor. El Torito Mexican food a chain is just as good if not better. They also charge for WATER! What!   Overall I really hated this place, but cant give it one star because the food is average.",

    "text": "I can not say enough good things about Border Grill. It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. My most recent visit was due to them updating their brunch menu. The weekend brunch is a fantastic deals at $30 for all you can eat tapas (add on all you can drink mimosas for $5). There are items on the menu to appeal to every taste from 'traditional' breakfast to people who want something more like lunch. If you're a pancakes person, definitely try the mexican chocolate chip pancakes or the bread pudding french toast. The chorizo sausage biscuit and gravy is great, so are the chilaquiles and the shrimp and grits. I love their short ribs, so I was super excited to have the short rib hash. My roommate loved the frittata (also new to the menu) and he normally hates eggs. I love the green corn tamales, but those are on the regular dinner menu too. Be sure to ask them to bring out the guava empanadas.  My only criticism is that I want to order everything and I end up completely stuffed. The service is always excellent - the staff and management both makes a point of getting to know their regulars. I always mock the people in the restaurant on the weekends with the lunch menu. Spend the same amount and get a huge variety of amazing food. It's Mexican twists on American dishes and some interesting interpretations of classic Mexican food as well.",

    "text": "Joining the BF's colleagues for dinner, Border Grill was the choice for the evening.  When approaching the restaurant after walking through the maze of Mandalay Bay, it may appear that Border Grill isn't very large.  However, you'll find lots of large tables available downstairs too.    They seat you down with plenty of salty tortilla chips and a tiny platter of three sauces.  There was one that was green that I just loved, and another one of the two red ones that was yummy too.    Drink orders first!  I had their Cruzan Mojito, which is described as \"Cuba's most popular cocktail; cruzan estate light rum muddled with fresh mint, lime, and a touch of soda.\"  This was oh-so yum and among the best mojitos ever.  However, not so strong but tasty indeed.  I also tried someone else's Mango Mojito and it was oh-so yummy too!  The BF had the Caipirinha, which is \"a Brazilian classic, fresh juices muddled with sugar drowned in ypioca cachaca.\"  It tasted a bit better than my previous experience with Caipirinha, but still a bit strong tasting.  Our waiter was super friendly and a such a doll.  They get you going when they offer the Guacamole (mashed avocado with cilantro, red onion, jalapeo, and lime).  It's standard fresh guacamole, nothing particularly special about it but it does come with a little salad of something or other on the side.  Not sure what to order, I ask for suggestions from the waiter and comes up with a few.  I decide on the Grilled Skirt Steak, which is \"marinated in garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime; served with charred corn relish, tomato avocado salad, and black beans.\"  I chose my steak rare and it came out nicely to my liking.  The initial bite was very enjoyable...tasty and delicate.  However, as I ate the rest of my steak, I felt it lacked some flavor.  I ended up dipping my steak into the sauces left on the table for the chips to give it a kick.  The tomato avocado salad was a nice blend of heirloom tomatoes that was a nice accompaniment, but the charred corn relish was a bit too hard for my tastes.  (The BF finished it off though.)  And the black beans were standard too.  This came with a large flour tortilla that I ended up not eating.  The BF had the Cochinita Pibil, which is \"achiote marinated pork slow roasted in banana leaf with cinnamon, grilled onions, black beans, and plantain orange salsa.\"  It was recommended by the waiter because it came from southern Mexico and is considered a rare dish to find on a menu.  I took the first bite and gave it back to the BF.  The pork was nothing special and I was disappointed.  The BF wasn't so impressed either as he kept on eating my steak instead.  It came with corn tortillas that the BF felt overpowered the pork.  And the plantains were okay too.  Overall, the food was okay.  Dinner for the two of us costs $84, which is definitely not worth it when eating Mexican food.  (Both of us have been to central Mexico, so it's a little hard to justify spending so much on this type of food.)  I would be curious if they had a happy hour just for drinks and appetizers though.  Then you'll see me coming back to drink up on their mojitos!   Sidenote:  Watch out for their elevator.  With the six of us in it, it made a funny sound that had us catching our breath for a moment.  And I know we didn't eat all that much now!",

In regard to the food, the salt shaker seemed to have taken the place for any spices or real seasoning.

Border Grill definitely lived up to my expectations. The restaurant is located in Mandalay Bay and is very nice. It's dark inside and the walls are covered in interesting modern art. The food was delicious! While the menu had a wide variety of choices included kobe beef tacos with a pineapple salsa and duck nachos (!), I chose the Border Classics, which is an appetizer but can easily fill you up. The appetizer included chicken panuchos, green corn tamales and plantain empanadas. This was a great choice. The chicken panuchos were small but delivered a powerful spice. The green corn tamales were sweet and I couldn't get enough of them, the texture was unbelievable. As for the empanadas, my god, they were absolutely fantastic. The combination of the sweetness of the plantains and the cotija cheese was wonderful. I enjoyed my dinner with the cucumber cooler, which is a mojito with a cucumber twist. Delicious and refreshing! After coming here, I can confidently say that I'd love to go back to Border Grill again and again, I'm glad there are a few near where I live!",

The fish was covered in a sticky paste that I assume was supposed to be the aji pepper paste, but that should have been mixed in with a good helping of lime juice.  I can't remember the last time I sent something back, but I was happy to get this off the table!  Our server was really nice about it though... she removed it from the check with no problem.  We then got our entrees... I had the carnitas tacos, my husband had the beef tacos, and our friend had the corn tamales (she's veggie.)

Not everything was a winner but it was fun to try everything and wonder what would come out next.   Dishes are tapas size, but you do get full pretty quick.  It was very hard not to fill ourselves with their freshly made chips and salsa.  The chips were warm and with just the right amount of salt.  They were totally addictive.   I wish I could remember the amazing server we had.  She was so friendly. She chose the best dishes from the menu for us to try, and we weren't disappointed.   I asked for duck chilaquelles (sp) at the end because that was the dish I wanted to order full size at first.  I'm glad I didn't because I wasn't too crazy about that dish, but it could have been because I was so stuffed from eating 6-7 dishes at that point.   I think it was a nice break from Vegas high-end buffets.  You pay about the same but get the full service experience and prettier presentation.  We didn't have room for dessert at the end,  unfortunately.  If you have a big appetite, do give Border Grill a try.",

    "text": "After a long day of travel & convention set-up I was hungry & looking for some yummy eats. After an underwhelming culinary experience at the last hotel I stayed at (um a Toby Keith tribute bar is all you got? Really?) it was a pleasant change of pace to be in s hotel with multiple options.  I initially chose BG because I was thinking chips & a margarita would be the ultimate treat but after perusing the menu I settled on a black cherry mojito instead. The chips were amazing & crisp and I never once regretted my decision to sit on the patio. It overlooks the Mandalay Beach and the sight of palm trees, desert sky & a warm breeze was awesome. My drink arrived and didn't disappoint: slightly sweet syrup + fizz + mint = delicious! I decided on the grilled fish tacos and they arrived less than 10 minutes after I ordered, a definite plus since I was starving. The tacos themselves were delicious, the fish wasn't oily, the veggies were fresh and it was all topped off with a creamy sauce. I picked at the slightly underdone rice and suspiciously black as night beans and luckily had kept the chip basket to keep munching as I ate dinner.  Staff was friendly & very accomodating, my server was nice and offered her suggestions (hello mojito!) to make for a very enjoyable meal. I never felt abandoned or neglected & for those who dine solo this can sometimes be an issue. Thanks for a nice evening Vegas I'll never go back to that faux country western music video hell again!",

First I was looking for a lunch place after just arriving at my hotel and the hostesses totally ignored me and continued to talk with each other, even after I went inside to look at the bar and then came back up to them. Needless to say I left.   I went there again later that day but not by choice. It was my cousin's wedding reception and they had reserved it there, including open bar. We were about 20 minutes early and they wouldn't let us in even 5 minutes before 8, even though we had already paid for everything and were just looking for a place to sit down. So they made us wait until the very last minute.   Lastly, while the appetizers and drinks were ok, the main course unfortunately not. Several guests didn't even eat theirs and I only ate mine because I was so hungry. It was paella and it was way too greasy without any flavor.  So combination of bad service and food did them no favors.",

With an menu boasting an all-you-can-eat tapas and $5 bottomless mimosas, it really didn't take any convincing on my part, especially since we hadn't really ever been able to get to the Border Grills in LA.  The restaurant itself is contemporary looking, with big line drawings on the wall and an open feeling to it.  We were sat immediately on the outside patio that looks out over the Mandalay Bay Pool, not a bad place to sit at all.  Their menu is tapa style and you order the ones want throughout the meal.  I was determined to try them all, and got a decent way through the menu.  I think we could all agree the short rib hash was the most amazing thing we put in our mouth, but the shrimp and grits gave it a run for its money.  You also cannot leave without trying their churro tots, so make that part of your selection too!  The food was so amazing, and totally worth the price (especially because you're in Vegas) and add the $5 unlimited mimosas, and try all the different types they offer!  This is a must go to while in Vegas!",

I would like to give a 4 star amended review on service alone based on a message I received from a manager at Border Grill after I posted my initial review.   Although they really didn't do anything horribly wrong during my visit, the manager apologized for not providing a wow experience, thanked me for my feedback, and invited me to contact them in the future for a complimentary meal.   It is so nice to see a business that does not get defensive in the face of criticism, let alone one that goes out of its way to display such gracious behavior. Certainly, this type of welcoming, open, and friendly customer service is rare and should be commended. Thank you, Border Grill!",

I have also tried several other appetizers such as the chicken quesedillas, sauteed shrimp,  empanadas and bacon wrapped dates. All of which are pretty good.

I like guac with sundried tomatoes.  2 stars  Green Corn Tamales ($10)-I thought the tamalito was the bomb, this is super yummy too!  I made this appetizer my entree!!!  It came with a side of sour cream and pico de gallo, but I didn't even need it.  Plain is good for me!!  5 stars!!!  Duo Ceviche ($15)-two types of ceviche, baja and peruvian on one plate, but they share one thing in common...PLAIN.  2 stars  Achiote Chicken Caesar Salad ($15)-chicken was juicy. 3 stars  Spicy Shrimp Tacos ($19)-chipotle shrimp...but my friend expressed that it tasted like butt cheeks.  She hated it.  I tasted it and even though I don't know what butt cheeks taste like, I know that I won't be eating anymore of this shrimp.  She gave it 1 star  Machaca Chilaquiles-brisket, crispy tortilla chips, cheese, eggs, onions, roasted peppers, all mixed together in a pile.  Because this is brunch, my friend got a plate of fresh fruit, cream cheese pastry and a sticky bun. He gave this 5 stars.  I agree.  Service was wonderful, but as you can see, the number of stars given to each particular dish fluctuates.",

Their menus had convoluted descriptions for very basic Mexican dishes.    Their tamale appetizer was crap.  It was supposed to be a baked tamale but it ended up being mush.  It wasn't even cooked properly.  If that is the way it's served than don't call it a tamale, call it corn tamalito or corn mush.  And btw, if I wanted corn mush, I would go to Chevy's not a \"fine dining\" Mexican restaurant.  They don't set the table with salt or pepper, which I think is really weird.  When I asked for salt, the waitress said, \"What is it for?  Your chips?\"  Like I couldn't have it otherwise.  When the salt arrived, they served it in a side dish.  Not a shaker.  YET, they sell cookbooks. \"Don't come back to our restaurant, cook your own food with these books.\"  BAD marketing.  This place isn't worth it when there are so many other restaurants that don't need to try as hard as Border Grill does.  And, they will offer you salt.",

We then had a plate of fresh fruit drizzled with honey, empanadas were also good. Next we had the queso fundido topped with  chorizo and a side of  flour tortillas.

The corn tamales were fresh and delicious.    The steak Salad was delicious - I really tried to only pick out the steak because I ate too many chips.....cooked perfectly and flavorful.  The Empanadas were not only delicious but we took some back to our room and ate them later that night - Never had anything like them, they were like a dessert.      I will have to go back (to the Santa Monica location) and try some of the Steak Tacos.  I don't typically LOVE Mexican food but I love this style of Mexican food.  It's cleaner and flavorful.

I've been here a few times for their weekend brunch and was less than satisfied. Revert to my previous review to read that nonsense.  But tis True. Their regular lunch menu is superb. I've been here twice in the past two days for business lunches. Tried a chicken salad off their special menu and their Pepper Crusted Steak Salad off their permanent menu-now I'm hooked! I'm a sucker for a hearty salad. Someone at the table said this is their go-to on property lunch and I whole-heartedly agree! The sirloin had a perfect sear. Nice and pink inside. A teensy bit chewy but it tasted fantastic. This isn't a salad for the feint of heart. It's packed full of roasted peppers, avocado, chewy corn bits and sprinkled with blue cheese. Perfection.   Not to mention their chips are fresh fried in-house and served with a trio of delicious salsas. If in case anyone had an onion allergy, their tomatillo salsa is onion free! Found that out from one of my dining mates. Best of all, it's all complimentary. Which gives you a reason to splurge on their guac ;D   Touche Border Grill. Way to prove a girl wrong.",

    "text": "We almost always eat here when we are attending an event at the Mandalay Bay Event Center.   The food is generally delicious no matter what you try.  The complimentary chips and salsa are great.  We also ordered the Baja Ceviche and the Queso Fundido as our starters   The Ceviche is outstanding and quite large. You could definitely order this as your entree.  The Queso Fundido, which is a cheese dip with shredded beef, was also really good.  Surprisingly, it was not as greasy as I expected it to be which was a total plus!   I had the Sauteed Shrimp and Scallops.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and had an excellent texture.  They were not at all rubbery.  The broth that the scallops and shrimp were in was very good and the added rice completed the plate.  My husband always orders the Chicken Mole Verde and he loves the Peruvian corn that accompanies it.    I was very underwhelmed by dessert which is my favorite course. We ordered the Pineapple Upside Down Cake which was dry and the Banana Cream Pie.  The Banana Cream Pie was highly recommended by our waiter which was shocking because it was completely tasteless.  The service at Border Grill can be hit or miss and the service last night was definitely a miss.  At the bar, I ordered a Sangria Margarita.  This drink is so good, but I order it with sugar on the rim in lieu of salt (salted rims are really gross to me).  The drink came with the a salted rim.  I am not one to send something back so I just wiped the salt off and moved along.  At the table the second drink I ordered was also incorrect.  Our waiter kind of lacked personality. I asked him if he knew where their new 2nd Las Vegas location was opening. He explained he \"wasn't moving there so he didn't know.\" and seemed visibly annoyed when I asked him if he could ask another server for me. Then he never answered the question.   Despite this review, based solely on my experience last night, I would still recommend this spot.  We've had better meals here on other nights and I will definitely update my review the next time we go.",

I recommend starting at the bottom of the list and moving up; the best stuff is near the bottom. However, if you're more a pick and choose, the serrano ham waffle is a must as are the breakfast fries. They have 8 flavors of mimosas, which you can add on to your brunch as bottomless for another $10 (totally worth it); a good change from the normal orange juice. Beware though, they are a glass of champagne with a scoop of fruit puree at the bottom, as opposed to a normal 50/50 oj to champagne.  Our waitress was wonderful and gave us a good recommendation as how to go about the menu. She said the top four items (yogurt parfait, tomatillo egg Benedict, egg sandwich and chili relleno) weren't very good and unless you were super into the idea of any of those.  Overall very satisfied and highly recommended!",

Green Corn Tamale - Very good! Slightly sweet tamale served with pico de gallo and sour cream. A good combination of both sweet and savory.  Yucatan Egg Benedict - very different from traditional eggs benedict, but delicious. They are served on a homemade corn biscuit and topped with shredded pork. Yum!   Mexican Rice pudding parfait - I love rice pudding! This wasn't the best I've had, but good.   Plantain empanadas - These were good but probably my least favorite part of the meal.   Machaca Chilaquiles - everyone at the table agreed that the chilaquiles were the best item we ordered. Very cheesy and flavorful.  Peruvian Shrimp and Grits - another favorite. I loved the sauce! The grits were also quite tasty.   Guava Empanadas - flaky and perfectly sweet.   Fruit - Fresh except for the strawberries. Slightly disappointing since strawberries are my favorite. It included honeydew, cantaloupe, strawberries and pineapple.   Bottomless Kinky Mimosa (passion fruit, pomegranate and blood orange) - yum! I'd never think to combine those flavors in one drink, but I approve!  I would highly recommend checking this place out!",

The menu outlined flavorful sauces and fresh ingredients but the meals disappointed.  My mole chicken didn't have any flavor and nothing that resembled mole sauce. It was dry and had no spices.   One colleague ordered the habernero steak and lobster and it was bland. They said the pepper flavor was in the butter but both were hardly noticeable. They brought him the \"hottest sauce\" in the restaurant and it was awful. I have had jar salsa with more zing.   Definitely not worth the price..",

Small plates have become just about my favorite thing in Vegas, mostly because I'm gluttonous, but also because I like to try all the different flavors. Brunch seemed to be the best use of my certificate!  We were seated immediately overlooking the pools--what a cool view! Our server came by and took drink orders. My friend who was flying out that day ordered bottomless mimosas, and I, her trusty chauffer, went for the minty lime \"refresher\" that was basically a mojito without booze or simple syrup. It was delicious and its title as a refresher was apt. We ordered a few to start, but the server informed us that he would be sending some things our way as well.  We ended up trying nearly every small plate on the menu. Standouts for us were the rajas taco, shrimp and grits, breakfast enchilada, biscuit and gravy, french toast/bread pudding, Oaxacan pancakes, egg benedict, and the fresh fruit with the passion fruit sauce. (I just basically listed the whole menu for good ones. Not so much were the plantain, black bean and cheese empanadas (they were straight up weird) and the jalepeno PBJ (again, weird, and somehow misses the mark). The PBJ was served on a little biscuit with an egg, bacon, peanut butter, jelly,  and raw jalepenos. It didn't work for me. When we started ordering, the server asked how we wanted our eggs prepared for egg dishes, and so it was assumed that I wanted an over easy egg for the PBJ--I think maybe scrambled would have worked better? But I wasn't entirely sold on the flavor combination.  I deducted a star for the cramped seating on the patio. Every time I moved outside my little box to put on a sweater or stretch my arms, I felt like there was a server or server assistant right behind me. I watched Phineas and Ferb on a girl's cell phone with remarkable clarity two tables away. It was too close and I couldn't imagine being a server there with alllll those plates to get out. They did it all amazingly, though I wish there was a little more space for dining.  I want to try the other meals here! I loved the decor inside and it seemed to be a fun place, if off the beaten path of Mandalay Bay.",

    "text": "Above average Mexican food located inside Mandalay Bay near the Convention Center area.  I was desperate to find decently priced and decently tasting food for dinner while staying at MB. It was getting to the point that neither me nor my boyfriend would make a decision about where to eat, so I opened the Yelp App, looked at the closest places within walking distance, and called Border Grill to see if I needed a reservation. The lady said there was about a 40 minute wait so I put in our names and we took the 7 minute walk from our room to the restaurant. Upon arriving, we realized there was no need for a reservation as the place was only half full, so we took a seat in the open seating bar area and had a server come over right away.  We each ordered a smoky watermelon margarita, which were delicious, and were brought chips and a trio of salsas. Each salsa was spicy and flavorful and we couldn't stop dipping our chips. To start, we ordered the Queso Fundido which comes with warm tortillas. It was good, but very filling and greasy. I wish we had had a third person to help eat it because we didn't come close to finishing it. We also split the chicken poblano enchiladas. We barely finished these as well! The chicken was seasoned well and I loved the sauce they topped it with.  I would love to come back and check out the brunch menu. It looks insane!  Tip: if you check in here, you get a free tamale! We were so full that we didn't take advantage of this, but it's worth a try!",

    "text": "Honestly, the food was fine and so were the drinks.  The 2 stars are reflecting the restaurant's policy of adding a shady $1.00 donation (for tap water) to a charity on your bill without asking, I research charities and I know a lot of them are way out of kilter in their ratio of \"admin costs\" vs actual direct services, so I don't want someone to choose who I donate to.  And tax me for it. And they keep all the write offs.  And don't tell me until I ask what the charge is on my bill.  If they were like a grocery store that asked if I wanted to donate after the bill came...fine.  But slipping it in without asking? Colored the whole place as shady in my eyes (obviously $1 is nothing on a $100+ dinner bill...it's the policy).",

The unlimited small plates are amazing, sometimes the consistency of the dishes is a little off as far as what it's served with, but have never been disappointed in the taste of the food. Couple that with the multiple flavors of bottomless mimosas and it is definitely or favorite spot for brunch!! Service is always great, you are very rarely looking for a server to ask for anything!

    "text": "Came here for dinner with a friend before seeing a show at the Mandalay Bay Events Center. Knowing it can get busy on a Saturday, especially on the night of a show, I made a reservation on OpenTable. Got there on time and checked in at the hostess stand. I wanted inside seating because eating outside during a Vegas summer isn't preferable while dressed up for a show. However, the wait for an inside table was going to be 20-30 minutes. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of my reservation? Since we had a show to get to, we reluctantly took the patio seating to get seated immediately.  Our server Carmie was very nice. She was very helpful when asked for appetizer recommendations. We were torn over which ceviche to order, but she informed us that we could split a ceviche order in half and get a bit of each. Perfect solution. We tried the Baja Ceviche and the Tuna Crudo (the recommendation of Carmie). Ultimately, I preferred the Tuna Crudo. Props for the recommendation. Because we're locals, Carmie suggested we sign up for the VIP Club, which would get us 15% off on future visits, as well as the current visit. Saving money is always appreciated.  As for my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja off the specials menu. It was braised beef short rib, carrot puree, mojo, and crispy yucca. Knowing I'm eating on the Strip, I was a bit worried how much short rib I'd get for $27. Once the dish came out, I was pleasantly surprised at the portion. It was a ton of short rib. Very tender and I could pull it apart without the need for a knife.  Overall a good experience, but not perfect due to the inability to seat us inside even though we had a reservation.",

The first assistant spilled water (which apparently we are charged $.50 each for) on the table, apologized, and walked off... We cleaned it up. They brought us another napkin which was then used to dry the silverwear as they did not bring new, dry silverwear. We ordered our food and drink (we both got the ayce brunch and unlimited bloody mary's= $120). Another assistant brought ouf food rather quickly, put a dish of grits on the table. I had moved the dish to the side only to realize this was not our order, she removed the grits, then went to another table. That was the wrong table also. When she found the correct table, she placed the same grits that I had touched, on their table... Granted I did not touch the food part, but still I wouldn't want a dish that another customer had touched... When we got our actual food, the benedict was cold as was the bbq slider. The saving grace was the shrimp and grits and the pig in the croissant. Delish... The steak and eggs were yummy, even though my friend ordered it well done (i am a med rare gal). The breakfast shots (extra) were pretty good. The lemon drop was the worst. Tasted like vodka and lemon juice, no sweetness to speak of... The server was ok but not a lot of personality. The assistants were more fun than he was, even the \"water spiller\" was friendlier... Overall, if I am going to spend $200 for breakfast, I am definitely spending it somewhere else.",

The service was a let down. Though our server was nice, another server dropped a plate and spilled all over me while my boyfriends quesadilla came out without cheese...  The only vegan entree option was a vegan cauliflower paella that tasted awful. Though they can make other items, such as the butternut squash, vegan - they didn't label as such. It was confusing to say the least.  Our drinks, which were recommended by the server, were rather sugary and weak.  Vegan or not, I wouldn't recommend.

The food and service were so good we decided to come back for their AYCE Sunday brunch with bottomless mimosas. I like how this place is different from all the other basic Vegas buffets. You're able to order as many small tapas as you'd like. We basically tried everything and then some. Also, they have a large variety of mimosa flavors, so you never get tired of drinking them!

    "text": "The unlimited breakfast tapas at Border Grill is priceyyy but it is pretty amazing if you have a big appetite and can hold your mimosas. The food will run you about $50 after tax so eat up or you'll feel like I did (an idiot lol). I wish I didnt come there so late, i had to order everything as once and try to eat it all while it was hot.   That was my fault though. Not theirs and the food was good overall with some pretty amazing standouts.   -The steak and eggs is one of the best I have ever had. Steak was soo flavorful. Must try.   -The green tamale is on the sweet side and it is delicious especially with you cut the sweetness with a lil sour cream.   -The smoked brisket slider was reallly good. Not too sweet or salty.   -The chicken and waffles are ok. Sadly the waffle tasted like frozen waffles. Its not bad but forgettable   -The red tamale i didnt really like it was dense and kinda dry.   -The Peruvian shrimp and grits also missed the mark for me. The shrimp and the sauce it was in just wasn't delicious to me.   It took awhile to get service but once we met our waiter the service was great. David (i think) our server really had some great recommendations and was super chill.   We sat outside under the heaters overlooking what is probably a pretty lively pool during the summer.",

I love the chicken poblano were really good except for me - it was a little too salty. They said their churros are amazing but we were too full to find out!",

The Mandalay Bay food court helps solve this if you don't mind feeling like you are back in middle school and fighting for a seat after you have your food.  But the real gem, if you can grab a seat, is a short walk back towards casino at Border Grill or the Social Club a bit farther on.  Border Grill was so good though that I ate a late lunch/early dinner there 2 days in a row.  Friendly service, fresh and semi-healthy food choices, and some great cocktails.  Prices not outrageous.  If you are feeling social, sit at bar or bar table and strike up a conversation with your neighbor.  Memorable was their carne asada (steak) tacos.  Be sure to check in on yelp and get your free tamale...delish.  Chips and Salsa are very nice.  Mojitos and Mai Tais were great as well.",

I like that the corn tortilla chips came with a trio of salsas including verde, chipotle and regular. All delicious. They had a several different types of ceviche with white fish and shrimp combos served on a large chip. My baja ceviche which had onion, shrimp, white fish, avocado and tomatoes. Very good but a bit saltier than I would I have liked. Others in the group enjoyed the shrimp and scallops and brisket tacos as well.  For a drink, I ordered a classic mojito... very refreshing and minty.  Check in for a free corn tamale!",

My favorites were the tuna tostada, soles al pastor (with Kurobuta pork cheek) and the campechana. These were paired with their delicious house margaritas.  Dinner:  The roasted beet salad had fresh greens and nutty flavors with a perfectly balanced acidity. The grapefruit Serrano mule was a delicious compliment. The hamachi crudo then delighted my taste buds with a nice caviar. The blood orange Margarita shifted us nicely into the short ribs. The meat was tender and melted as you savor the flavor. The Colorado lamb chop was perfectly prepared and had a nutty pepita crust. The mission fig old fashioned needed a bit more fig syrup for me, but transitioned my taste buds for the duck carnitas. The tender duck was braised with delightful seasonings. Dessert: flourless chocolate almond cake which tasted just as good the next day because I couldn't eat it all!  Previous review: We love the brunch offerings. They have all inclusive with great mimosas. The huevos rancheros, chiliqueles and steak and eggs are my favorite dishes.",

Loved the Avocado ceviche & Peruvian potatoes and Brussels with no chorizo (our choice) - this was such a delicious combination!  Only a few items are truly Vegan but some can be modified.   My partner tried the tres leches cake, it was gross.  Very hard and very little flavour - skip this.  Beyond the cake the only other disappointment was the lengthy delay it took to clear the tables around us.  We were there on a Saturday around 7:30 pm so maybe it was just because they had been so busy earlier.",

Infact we have been a big fan of Susan ever since we went to her other restaurant in Los Angeles called \"Street\".   Border Grill is located towards the very back of the Mandalay Bay Hotel.  We went to the Saturday all you can eat brunch and we had a great time.  The endless pomegranate misosa and all the tapas we had tried were fantastic.  The only thing regrettable is that we got so full that we could not get to taste all of them.  It is so much better than your average  \"All You Can Eat Buffet\"  places that are rampant in the strip. The other thing that we noticed is that in both restaurants, all the servers were well learned of what they are serving and oh so friendly.  They all made us feel as if we were friends visiting for brunch.   Great food and great customer service,  we can not wait to come back to this place the next time we visit Las Vegas",

We ordered fajitas, margaritas, chicken nachos, quest fundido w/chorizo (which came highly recommended by the waiter). All the food was drowned in oil including the chips. We started with the queso fundido and it was just horrible. There was so much oil we literally tasted it once and couldn't continue. The fajitas was also drowned in oil. My husband couldn't even eat the bell peppers because of the amount of oil on them. He only ate 1/2 of his meal, and he is not the type of man that leaves food on his plate. My chicken nachos were so oily that I only ate a 1/3 of it. I paid for that later on that night. I couldn't even enjoy being in Vegas because I spent the rest of the night in the bathroom. I would not recommend if you want REAL Mexican food, especially if you want to enjoy your time in Vegas without running into a restroom. I'm so upset that we wasted $80 on food we didn't eat or enjoy.",

I ordered the \"spicy\" grilled shrimp and received what appeared to be bland, boiled shrimp atop a bed of watery rice. Literally. The rice was floating in broth and greens. My friend was given the suggestion of the seasonal fish, so he ordered it. The waitress failed to mention it was resting in a bowl of soup, despite the 100+ degree weather. The dessert, chocolate pie, was obviously premade thawed, and the drinks were overpriced and boring. The strawberry sangria tastes like Franzia. Overall, the food lacked any substance, as did our waitress, who kept telling us yes, then no, and blaming it on her manager for the night. Not worth even the Travelzoo prices.",

If I have a salad the next time I go back (and I will), I'll be sure to ask for the dressing on the side. Also, the chips are yummy, chunky, made fresh in the back type chips, which is always a bonus.",

My girlfriend was really looking for a good meal with lots of flavor and this didn't disappoint.  We walked from the Wynn to Mandalay Bay to take in Las Vegas on our last night, so definitely worked up an appetite.  The margaritas were very clean and crisp with a hint of spice and paired great with the ceviche sampler that we started with.   After we demolished the delicious starter, we moved on to entrees - she had the Chicken Mole Verde and I went with the Yucatan Pork.  Both were incredibly filling and so very flavorful.  The Chicken was succulent and the pork was just delicious.  We had eaten enough that we didn't dare eat dessert and ended up taking some of our entrees home with us.  The wait staff topped off the experience by being involved, friendly and attentive.  Would highly recommend and plan to go there again when in Vegas.",

'twas pricey...but i guess it was worth it.   i would probably come back for happy hour or margheritas  p.s. i tried the food truck in la which i enjoyed...and i know there's a location in santa monica...maybe MAYBE i'll go again",

Two flavors stood out: cinnamon and salt. The chicken enchiladas were wrapped in a thick tortilla almost impenetrable. The soup was interesting: a stewed tomato taste with subtle heat.  Chips and salsa were fine.  Was expecting more from this place. Too bad. Nice people work there and they do their best to sell the food as upbeat as possible. The food lets them down.",

I was in Vegas for a conference and stopped for lunch, the menu had some inticing items, but what caught my eye was a special of Pork belly tacos. I always love when a chef thinks a little outside the box and offers something to tantalize my tastebuds. Braised pork belly witha spicy bbq type sauce and , I think sesame and pomegranite seeds, topped with a fresh slaw!! Service was spot on and loved that they offered a variety of non-alcohol beverages beyond the standard tea and soda, try the sparkling peach lemonade. I can't wait for my next visit to LV",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to go to the Santa Monica Border Grill back in 1995 while I was visiting some friends in L.A., and was blown away by it. I was at a conference in Las Vegas this last week, and I was happy to see that there was an outpost of the Border Grill there as well - of course I had to try it.  I went during lunch one day, and had the guac to start, followed by the chicken chilaquiles. Whenever I am in Mexico, I try to eat chilaquiles for breakfast, so I was pleased to see them on the menu (even though it was lunch time). The chips were cooked well, but were RIDICULOUSLY salty. I though that maybe I had just received a bottom of the basket set (or something like that), so I asked for some new ones, but those were amazingly salty as well. Once I dusted a large amount of salt off the chips, though, they were good, as was the guacamole. The flavors were nicely blended, and they didn't skimp on the onion.  The chilaquiles were a disappointment, though. They were the \"green\" version (as opposed to red or, more rarely, mole chilaquiles), and the green salsa was very acidic. I like the flavor of tomatillos, but these almost tasted underripe, which made for a weird flavor mix with the queso fresco and the corn tortillas. The chicken in the dish came in big chunks of dry white meat, and didn't taste like it had been cooked with the rest of the chilaquiles ingredients at all.  It was very disappointing. For comparison, I was comped a free breakfast buffet at the Wynn, where they had what they called chilaquiles with eggs (really, it was more like a chilaquiles/migas hybrid) - the flavor profile of that dish was much more authentic than what I had at Border Grill. I know that people think highly of the Wynn buffet, but still, when the food at a restaurant that prides itself on authenticity is beaten by a buffet offering, that's a bad sign.  I'll hang on to my good memories of the Border Grill in Santa Monica, but I won't be going back to the Vegas one again.",

By FAR the best brunch EVER and one of the best meals we have ever had. Yum! Anytime I am in Vegas I will go back.",

Had a chance to chat with the manager/business owner and I can tell that he really cares about the customer experience and quality of food they put out and wanting to make it the best possible for the customer. That is not always the case at a lot of places and I really appreciate that .  I loved the complimentary chips and 3 types of salsa you get when you sit down !!! So good. I also had the  Mexican sandwich with  smoked paprika Fries ! CHICKEN MILANESA.  It was great!  panko crusted chicken breast with oaxacan cheese, avocado, gem lettuce, pickled onion & carrots, lime aioli on telera bread .",

Sorry, but I don't see how this is a Vegas-quality restaurant.  Redeeming factor - servers tried really hard to make the experience better. Quality guys on that front.",

    "text": "We came in for lunch today. It was busy but we were able to get a high top at the bar without a wait. They offer a bar, inside seating and covered patio.  I started with the blood orange margarita, which was slightly spicy with a nice blend of peppers and chocolate on the rim. It was a unique and delicious margarita, but worth the 14$ considering it's in Vegas. They brought complimentary chips and trio of salsa. Tortilla chips are freshly fried on site, but not too spicy.  The menu states it's normally 4$ so that was a nice treat. We both had tacos.  They offer steak, shrimp, fish and carnitas, brisket and cauliflower paella (veggie) tacos on corn tortillas server with black beans and rice. They do offer a mix and match which isn't listed on the menu, so be sure to ask for that if you want to try a variety. You can also get flour tortillas. We both ordered fish, steak and shrimp tacos.  The steak and shrimp were my favorite. The steak was topped with onion, cilantro, salsa and avocado cream which blended perfectly with the flavor of the carna asada. The shrimp was really not spicy, and also a nice blend of flavors. The fish was plentiful and cooked well, the other two were just better.  They accidentally brought us a carnita taco, but replaced it quickly with correct tacos. We tried it, and were just average, although meat was nice. Service was good.",

Our server was so friendly and nice and attentive, he made our night.  When we wanted hot sauce with the complimentary chips, with three mild sauces, he sure delivered.  It had to been one of the spiciest hot sauce ever (ghost chiles).    The bean dip (don't eat this before going on a flight) was fantastic with pulled pork on top.  This could be a meal in itself (came with warm tortilla too).   My skirt steak was seasoned so well and cook a perfect medium rare, it was better than the $60+ steaks at other restaurants.  Came with so many sides too, I was beyond stuff.  Kudos to the delicious roasted brussel sprouts with bacon. Yum.   The seafood enchiladas was cooked maybe a tad over, but my colleague thoroughly enjoyed his meal (3 enchiladas).   For dessert, we got the pumpkin flan, per our waiter recommendation.  It was like eating a smooth pumpkin pie.    Highly recommend this place for a more moderately priced restaurant in the Mandalay Bay.  Your wallet and stomach will appreciate that!",

But the long maze was worth it!  We got the chips and salsa which I am not happy unless I get this when getting Mexican. Their chips were so amazing!!! The trio of salsa were good, though I personally love chunkier salsa. The guacamole was good!!! We both got the steak tacos, they were yummy though I felt like it needed something extra. The beans and rice were very good!!   Delicious patron margarita!  They have the cutest plates!!! And the decor is awesome and fun!!!  Every one was great! Our server was helpful!  I am happy that we ended up here!  Ask for their hot sauce, it's more like a salsa but so good, and the right amount of heat!",

The price point is better and the food selection surpasses the Bayside Buffet in Mandalay. We came on a Saturday morning and were seated immediately, outdoors by the pool area. It was a really nice view and thankfully the sun was out.  It's AYCE with plates served tapas style, so you just have to pace yourself so you can indulge your inner glutton. Our server was amazing - he took excellent care of us and made sure we got the full experience of the vast menu. We ate damn near everything on the brunch menu and and enjoyed all of it. The stars were the campechana, chilaquiles, steak & egg, and the breakfast tots. We had multiple orders of these items. The bread pudding and cinnamon roll pancakes were divine. I honestly cannot stop thinking about their food. It was that good.    For the price, this cannot be beat. The food, service, quality and overall experience was worth 5 stars and I have every intention of returning with my kids when we visit Vegas in March.",

I love when Mexican restaurants bring you complementary chips and salsa! Every Mexican restaurant needs to do this. The tomatillo (green), smoked salsa and the mild salsa were all very tasty in my opinion. Smoked salsa isn't something I have experienced too often, but I didn't mind it.   For my meal I ordered the carnitas tacos ($17). The corn taco shells were on the smaller side and they give you 3 of them. I was pretty disappointed in my tacos. The carnitas needed drained a little before throwing them on the taco shell. The taco shells were so soggy due to this. They give you two sides rice and black beans. The rice was on the dry side so I didn't eat much of that. I did like the black beans though. The prices are pretty steep for the quality of the food in my opinion.   The service was very slow. We were finished eating for what seemed like 15 to 20 minutes and waited for our checks. I can't say that it was because they were busy because they were in between lunch and dinner. Our server walked past our table multiple times and could clearly see we were finished but obviously he wasn't in a hurry to get us on our way.",

Son and I both had chicken enchiladas...the chicken was basically a paste of chicken in dry corn tortillas - not the best texture. I found the mushrooms on top to be an odd addition but fancy mushrooms, none the less.   Husband had Yucatan pork, he said it was yummy. He got a big portion of pork and he had rice and beans! Daughter had a side of rice and a side of beans for $10. I think the disappointment of this place is the price when you know how cheap beans, rice and tortillas are.   Chips and guac were yummy - but I've had just as yummy at el pollo loco for 1/2 the price.   For a large portion of slow cooked pork and chicken paste, I don't think this place is worth the hype or the price.",

While walking through the hotel, trying to find the place, I noticed an ad about the chef and she starred on the show Top Chef.  I admit, I was being judgmental for a split moment- thinking it was going to be a nose turned up place.  This restaurant appeared to be 20% filled and we were asked twice if we had reservations. Can someone please explain this to me?  Either way, we were seated immediately, water came along with free fresh chips and 3 variety of salsa. Say, que? Oh yes, the tortilla chips were fresh and the salsa were all mild spice to my liking.  The server offered a spicier version as an option, but we just stuck with the initial offerings.  The tacos were stellar, filled with large chunks of fish and definitely well worth the reasonable price tag of $18 for 3 tacos.  The right amount of cabbage, picked radish, avocado and the star was the seasoned fish.  With a quick yelp check-in deal, we got free green corn tamales to try. Accompanied with sour cream and a acidic version of the pico de gallo, this was a great compliment to this very sweet treat.  Make no mistake, this is not your average Mexican food joint. The food was excellent and it will surprise you.",

We also added the bottomless mimosas for $15 extra. So it may be a little on the pricey side but over all the food was pretty good. It's brunch with Mexican influence. If you look on the website, you can download the menu. But we had all of the food options available on the menu. Some of the better items were the torta sliders, the spicy chicken tamales, the tres leches bread pudding, the eggs benedict, the chilaquiles, and the secret menu item for the day, which was some sort of beef hash with fries. The sliders had a sweet taste to them and the spicy chicken tamales were soooo good but they had quite the spicy kick to them. I would probably say that i was least impressed with the chicken and waffles and the chorizo pigs in a blanket. The chicken and waffles had more of a strawberry syrup which I didn't care for. And the chicken was nice and cripsy, but had no flavor to it. The other thing I was really hoping for was the chorizo pigs in a blanket. Chorizo for me is always packed with flavor and maybe a little spicy, but this had no kick and almost resembled just a regular hot dog. Lastly, the mimosas were pretty good. They leave the bottle on the table for you so you can pour as much as you want (which I prefer) and they gave us several flavors to try. Apart from the food, the service was excellent, the people serving us were super friendly and quick with the champagne when we asked. Apart from a few sub par menu items, I would recommend this place!",

We were given two orders of the Yelp check-in despite not checking in at the time and an order of guacamole (server's mistake.)  After we saw a few of the vegan small plate options, we ordered a few: the empanadas and taquitos. The taquitos were good and all, but the empanadas were ridiculous. Nicely spicy, awesomely seasoned, and I just wish I had more. The Cadillac margarita we each got was one of the better ones I has in Vegas, too. The chips and salsa were okay, but easily the worst thing we had. The guacamole we got by accident was tasty though -- that I would buy next time.   They don't have vegan brunch options at this Border Grill, but they do at the one in LA. Our bartender told us a former chef came back in January and came up with some vegan options, which was awesome -- there aren't many vegan choices on the south end of the Strip.  TL;DR: Vegan empanadas and guacamole. Get on that.",

My enchiladas came in a deep green sauce that is not your typical salsa verde, and had charred vegetables on top. One of the chile rellenos was a typical breaded and fried, cheese-stuffed pepper, while the other was grilled and stuffed with vegetables.  The drinks did not disappoint. The standard margarita was right on. The blood orange margarita was not too sweet, like many flavored margaritas. It tasted like real fresh fruit, plus some heat, and had a mole rim.  For dessert, they gave us complementary salted chocolate chip cookies for my friend's birthday. They were warm and gooey, just fantastic. We also ordered arroz con leche, which was subtle and tasty, with fruit inside.   I look forward to trying one of their locations in LA.",

There is also a regular menu for other options as well.   Almost everyone chose the $35 option, and 2 people ordered from the set menu. My friend chose the torta and I ordered the tostada. We ordered bloody Mary's, coffee, etc as well.   The food was mediocre. Nothing special at all. My tostada was mushy because it probably got soggy after sitting in the kitchen for so long. The torta was so meh. No flavor. The bread was useless because it was so plain and flavorless.   All the food was arriving in order from the unlimited menu option. However, the 2 separate orders were extremely late. As in 45 minutes. As in the waiters had to check if she actually put in the order. Twice. To a point where we didn't even want them anymore.   Everyone had eaten and my friend and I were still waiting on our food.   Thennnnn the check came. We asked the waitress (I think her name was Tiffany) if she could separate the orders based on who got the $35 option and who got a separate dish. And no. She couldn't.  So one of the girls had to separate all the charges based on each person.  Also, the gratuity was not included for such a large party- so weird.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  Good food, but kinda pricey. We went to Border Grill randomly since we were staying at the Mandalay Bay and wanted to grab a quick dinner. It honestly reminds me of El Torito Grill or any other Mexican restaurant that's on the fancier end. We went on a Sunday night around 7pm and found it decently full, but with no wait. Keep in mind this was Labor Day weekend too. We weren't looking for a full-on meal and most of their dishes were $20+ so we ended up ordering the baja ceviche ($15) and the carne asada quesadilla ($19). Both were tasty, but a little too pricey for what you're getting, which is not much, in my opinion. I know it's Vegas and it's a very nice restaurant so I can't really blame them, but I doubt I will return. It's just Mexican food. I can get both dishes for cheaper and tastier elsewhere.  The two highlights were the complimentary chips and salsa (they give you 3 different sauces) and the service. Our waiter was nice enough to even pack our leftover chips and salsa, which was awesome. Not really a must if I'm ever in Vegas again, but Border Grill is good and would make a nice date place so it's a solid 3.5 stars in my book.",

    "text": "***Like many restaurants in Las Vegas, Border Grill is a multiple-location restaurant; while it might not be the most original Vegas dining experience, the kitchen does a good job of churning out quality food with great consistency not found at many big brands on The Strip***  Las Vegas, especially The Strip, is filled with second location restaurants from big name chefs. Border Grill in Mandalay Bay is one of them. Several of these restaurants are disappointing especially due to how it feels like quite a few Vegas kitchens are phoning it in because they are going to get a big customer base regardless of the quality. Border Grill is not that way though.  Border Grill features upscale Mexican cuisine, and while it may not elevate Mexican cuisine to justify the high price point, food is prepared with consistency here. My lunch started with a complimentary basket of hearty and crunchy tortilla chips. The chips came with a trio of sauces with two of them being surprisingly spicy for somewhat mainstream Mexican cuisine.  For my entree, I had their chile relleno, which I enjoyed quite a bit. The roasted poblano was filled with a really good, thick and stretchy Mexican cheese. The poblano was nicely cooked and flavorful. The outside crispy crust was good and not too greasy. The chile relleno came with sides of two kinds of rice and really good pureed black beans topped with Mexican cheese.  For dessert, I had their salted chocolate chip cookies with condensed milk ice cream. Of all the restaurants I have ever been to, this was probably the best bang-for-the-buck dessert I have ever had. At $6, the dessert included not 1, not 2 but 5 large salted chocolate chip cookies. And the cookies were delicious. They were fresh out of the oven and were nicely crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with warm and gooey chocolate chips (perfect chocolate flavor).  The cookies were accompanied by two generous scoops of condensed milk ice cream. The ice cream was very creamy and not icy, and it delivered on its name by really getting across the condensed milk flavor with every spoonful.  Service was friendly and quick.  Their lunch prices vary. Some items like the chile relleno are priced about right given that it is Vegas, but some of their more entree-dishes are in the high-$20s range and are probably not worth the high price tag.  In terms of the decor, Border Grill is okay. It is far away from the casino (near the convention center at Mandalay Bay) so you do not get the disturbance of cigarette smoke like you do at several other casino restaurants. Border Grill offers both indoor dining and an outdoor (and covered) patio.  Border Grill is a good spot for a satisfying and slightly upscale lunch. I have been to the Border Grill in Los Angeles, and it is about on par with this location. While Border Grill is known for serving upscale Mexican cuisine, several would say that Border Grill does not warrant their high prices. I would agree on that point to a certain extent. Rick Bayless' Chicago-based restaurants (especially Topolobampo) truly elevates Mexican cuisine by integrating hard-to-find Mexican ingredients and churning out moles of incredible complexity. Border Grill does not come close to that. But judging Border Grill on just what it really is, which is an upscale restaurant with Mexican flavors, it is a worthwhile lunch spot in Las Vegas--especially if you find yourself at Mandalay Bay, which is quite far from other notable Vegas casinos.  I noticed that Mandalay Bay no longer offers complimentary self parking. I imagine it is because they struggle to secure parking for their hotel guests during busy times. It is kind of a nuisance given how almost every hotel on The Strip offers complimentary self parking.",

Destiny helped me change the room at the last minute and Autumn helped me plan through the setup and decorations, listening to my requests but also giving her own feedback and ideas to make the event the best it could be. Once it started she stayed in close communication with me about our numbers and how close we were to the minimum. As servers, Autumn, Crighton, Jose, and Candice were all courteous, hard working, and did an excellent job of communicating with our guests about the drinks and food options. They also made sure to bring me drinks and food at the registration desk (It's easy to get forgotten as the Event Planner!) The real ice cream on top (pun very much intended) was that when Autumn noticed that we were nearing the end of the event without having hit our food and beverage minimum she spoke with the chef who was able to give us some mini ice cream cones(which we hadn't ordered.) It sounded like this worked out because there was some left over from an earlier order, but the fact that they thought of it and put it to use for us without blinking an eye is, in my opinion, the hallmark of awesome service.  All in all I couldn't be happier with the Border Grill team, and will be planning as many events as I can there in the future (I already signed up for the same time slot next year!)",

It's really deep within the resort, basically near the pool area.  If you're coming in from the monorail, basically keep walking past the casino and through restaurant row.  You'll know you're on the right path if you pass Aureole and then eventually you'll see signs pointing to Border Grill.  It was a beautiful day outside, so I decided to so sit at their Patio.  Even though I had a reservation, I opted to sit at the bar since the table they provided me had too much sun shining down on it.  But let's get on to the Border Brunch.  They provide you with a menu of about 22 dishes to order and you basically order anything you want.  For a solo diner, they recommend ordering two at a time and four to five dishes at a time if you're with a group.  Here in chronological order is what I ordered:  Empanada with Cinnamon Butter  -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1SxW5oq&s=2c592ae4fba8ddeb5055b51528c7f3ae82ead2f198ce3a8ed58346ccfdae86d0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1SxW5oq</a> This was like an amuse bouche and came with the Border Brunch.  Tomatillo Egg Benedict -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1BtOm6v&s=e1c272d852e96da637835b25211c8a9d0cf764a732b7e6a81eb34145a692dc3f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1BtOm6v</a> Cornmeal battered tomatillo, hominy grits, epazote hollandaise, roasted tomato, baked kale This was a good dish to start with.  Fried green tomato with a nice runny egg on top.  Delicious!!!  Breakfast Fries -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1TCYAHA&s=0493e2635b703a78ea34d52c36e633163e0a31288a143097cb79f77dc14df904\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1TCYAHA</a> Beer braised short rib, manchego cheese, bacon, sunny side egg This was very dish but I'm glad I got to try this.  It's a breakfast poutine essentially since you have cheese, short ribs, and a runny egg.  This is probably a dish better suited for a group to share because, even though this was only my 2nd dish, I was already starting to get full.  Serrano Ham Waffle -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1K1R5H7&s=19f9ef374871fe75541353400e0e907f84ae6e318e9a0d0986aef31fa87f6253\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1K1R5H7</a> Manchego cheese, maple syrup, butter I liked this!  It was a good combination of sweet and savory.  Peruvian Shrimp and Grits -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1IpX4Qk&s=c7a9528b504daf19827b15579f91d99d1649e73b5fa61d52151edca1c61e8d4e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1IpX4Qk</a> Aji panca salsa, roasted green chile, creamy parmesan grits Ordering this seafood dish was a good way for me to get my money's worth out of the $35.  The shrimp was cooked nicely and had a very nice kick to it with the chile.  A very unique take on shrimp and grits.  Oyster Taco -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ewZ4iE&s=b7f5c22e8aa59f40f2a4dcd0d2febdaac31c110a6b5c19092d4d6eda6146f625\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1ewZ4iE</a> Cornmeal battered oyster, flour tortilla, pickled chayote, tomato, buttermilk aioli At this point, I was pretty stuffed but I still wanted to try more.  This oyster taco is really about the size of a street taco so it was only a few bites, but that was more than enough for me.  I really enjoyed it!  Churro Tots -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1GxS79Z&s=ee0ffa35a7d90e3be815dbbf76edde7b20e38ec491e7d65fa50c49888392271e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1GxS79Z</a> Dulce de leche infused churros, cinnamon sugar, chocolate ganache, passion fruit puree From the beginning, I already planned on ordering this last since it's pretty much like a dessert.  As small as these tots were, they were pretty dense but had good flavor.  The two sauces worked well with them.  Overall, I thought the $35 AYCE tapas Border Brunch was worth it.  But I was really limited to my stomach capacity since I only got try 6 dishes out of the 22.  I highly recommend coming with a group if you plan to try all 22 dishes.  As for Border Grill, it's a really nice restaurant!  It's a nice take on upscale Tex-Mex food similar to Mesa Grill.  I did visit the other location at the Forum Shops which I'll review later, but I like this location a lot better, especially if you can snag a table outside.  I would definitely love to come back again to them for dinner.",

    "text": "Mexican food shouldn't be high-end. And it shouldn't be this expensive. The prices aren't unfair, especially for the inside of Mandalay Bay, but honestly, the food just doesn't taste that good.   The Torta Ahogada is a sandwich. It is a sandwich with a bunch of wonderful ingredients, but none of them make a difference. There's a giant, stifling roll that makes it impossible to taste anything else, which is a pity because the pork cheek inside is tender and soft, braised just right. To make matters worse, they soak the sandwich in a \"consome\" so the bread gets soggy, so you have to eat it with a knife and fork unless you want to burn your fingers off and permanently stain your shirt. It's impossible to eat a sandwich like a sandwich, i.e. all the ingredients in one bite, with a knife and fork. Seriously frustrating. We got one of the \"specials\". Very expensive, juicy shrimp and tender, medium-rare carne asada. Should be a winning combo with avocado and a fried egg, but it's just a bunch of stuff thrown on a plate. Not much flavor except for tomato and salt. Could have made this better at home, and I don't even cook.  Mandalay Bay is gorgeous. Check out the beach club, the aquarium, the hotel, etc. Find a better place to eat than Border Grill.",

    "text": "This is the best brunch in Vegas as far as I'm concerned.  Like if you really want a buffet then go to the Bacchanal or the Wicked Spoon or whatever, but remember that the food here is actually better.  Which it should be, because if you spring for the unlimited small plates plus unlimited booze, it does cost more.  But holy poop, it really is better.    Every single thing we had was great.  Food was quick.  Booze was quicker.  It's basically a buffet but you don't have to walk around with your own stupid legs to get the food and instead let some other sucker get paid to do it for you.  Highlights: Steak and egg.  Steak cooked perfect (to requested temp).  Lots of avocado and chipotle.  Lovely egg. Egg Benedict.  I love benedict and this is one of the best I've had. Campechana.  Perfect seafood cocktail.  Just right amount of seafood and acid.  One person commented that she shoulda just had 5 of these, but might not have gone well with the 6 glasses of champagne. Breakfast fries: finish your meal off with these.  They're delicious and also a pretty big dish so you can peck at them while you crank as many unlimited mimosas down your throat as your bladder/liver will handle.  Champagne: I was a little wary of paying 15 bucks extra for the mimosas because most brunches will just pour you straight champagne but my concern was unfounded.  They were strong on the champagne plus all the different varieties (blood orange, prickly pear, mango, etc) were good and welcome.",

Hubby also had the rice and I had the plantains which reminded me of fried tostones. I could have eaten those all day! The taco meat was very tender and so flavorful. I seriously considered going back again on night 2 . Make sure you have room because the portions are big. This restaurant is seriously one of the best restaurants on the strip!",

I only wanted a smaller meal and it was $14 for 3 street taco size hard shell w a small serving of beans and rice. None of it was distinctly flavorful and the avocado bed it was served on further detracted from its blandness the meat was stringy and didn't have the depth of flavor I expected. The corn relish did have sweet pops of flavor in the corn which i found pleasant.   Overall, decent but not great for the cost.",

Marginal; nothing special. We were far from the only table experiencing problems: during our wait, we saw the manager putting out fire after fire. One table apparently reporting long wait & cool food too (we found out they were right); at another table, 2 young ladies had a mimosa poured on top of them.   It should be noted that the manager did step up. He took care of our bill (drinks only; we did not eat the cold food but left still hungry & went elsewhere to eat) and offered to take care of our bill the next time. However, we live out of state, and while my friends come to Las Vegas annually, who knows when or if I might be back? The point is, the manager should not have had to \"make it right.\" Very disappointing.",

I had the most bland tasteless pork their \"signature dish\" which was over cooked, reheated, not fresh, and bland. The empanadas were the WORST I have ever had, soft and chewy, instead of crispy and flaky. The drinks were equally bad, over-priced cocktails that tasted like everything was made fresh from a mixer bottle. Nothing about this place was good, except for the friendly waitress and the good guacamole",

    "text": "I love the Border Grill.  Every time I visit LV, I go for the brunch.  I give it 5 stars for the overall experience and because when I like something there, I usually REALLY like it.   As an overall rating for others though, I would probably give it 4 stars .     At $34.99 plus $10 for unlimited mimosas, I think the brunch is expensive but for my dollars, it delivers good value.   I expect to spend 2 to 3 hours being served small plates and trying new and old flavors of mimosas.    The food and mimosa menu is constantly changing, so if I get something I really like, I pretty much keep ordering that until I'm full.  A couple of years ago, I had a grapefruit mimosa there that was so good, I stopped eating so I could drink more of them!  Champagne with grapefruit, honey and a little gin.   So very good.   So good that I experimented until I got the recipe down for myself.   I don't eat beef, chicken or pork, so my options are a bit limited but like I said, when they hit their mark with something, it is fantastic, like the SEASONAL FRESH FRUIT SALAD - housemade granola * lime zest * cayenne yogurt * bunelo cone .   Not only the flavors but the different textures of this dish are perfect.     The beauty of the small plates is that if you don't like something, you can just stop eating it and get something else.   Even though the  menu changes and they may not serve something I really liked previously, it's fun to try new dishes and take the time to savor and rate them.",

It's as many small plates as you like, and let me tell you. They're all amazing!!    For $10 per person you can also add bottomless mimosas. But they have delightful flavored like prickly pear, raspberry cucumber and blood orange!   Carmie B. Was our waitress. She was just an absolute delight. Besides being so sweet and tolerating out silly jokes, she was very prompt and anticipated all our needs. She really made this experience beyond incredible. I'd give 10 stars just for her!! Ask for her section.   Best birthday and Vegas brunch I've ever had. Absolutely will be back!!!",

    "text": "We went here for my birthday last night (and my twin brother's birthday). I had done a lot of research and thought this was our best bet for a Mexican place on the strip.... maybe... but there has got to be something better.   We started off with free chips and salsa (decent, green one was my favorite). Then, our server  asks if we'd like guacamole for the table ($10). We agreed thinking that it would be a big bowl of guacamole. Boy were we wrong. The guac arrived on a small plate and wasn't even enough to eat with chips and our meals.   As for drinks, don't get the pitcher of margaritas. You're better off drinking before or after you come here because WHAT A RIP OFF!!!! We got a pitcher ($50) and it was very small and filled more than half way with ice!!! There was only enough for one round of margaritas for the four of us, plus 2 more glasses we had to split... sorry but in a $50 pitcher we should be able to refill our glasses once with no problems.   Then came the food... I ordered the market vegetable quesadillas because I'm vegetarian and that was pretty much the only option besides the mushroom dish. I also asked for a side of black beans and rice, but I was told there was only black bean puree... um.. how do you get the puree if you don't have the beans? The quesadillas were gross and super soggy. The cheese was this thick white stuff (cojita? I think). Anyways, gross. I make better quesadillas myself. The rice tasted stale and the beans were weird  since I wanted real beans and not mush.  They did bring us free birthday desserts, which was nice. Overall, this place is HORRIBLE.",

    "text": "Sooooo super disappointed with my meal. I've watched the Two Hot Tamales on TV for years, when you could only find them on PBS.  So I was pretty excited to have a chance to dine at one of their restaurants.   My first issue was with the property itself - there's no restroom in the restaurant.  I only wanted to wash my hands so it was more than inconvenient to trek down a flight of stairs to do so (out in the casino).  At a minimum, they should have a sanitizer dispenser available.  I just hope the staff has some place more convenient for frequent hand washing.  Gross.   Then the service was just so-so.  I had one single refill during my meal and I had to ask for it!   Even then, the waitress took another 'forever' to honor my request.  She came up just as I was heading to the bar to get it myself.   All of that could have been forgiven had the food been remotely intriguing.  But it wasn't.  The guacamole had some funky twangy creamy action going on.  We Trued doctoring it with the tomatillo sauce. My friend's grilled fish tacos were over cooked and served on some stale tortillas.  Other flavors leaned towards bland.  Our other companion had to salt his carnitas.  Turns out, he paid dearly for his selection. He spent much of the night on the throne. My chicken quesadillas were just 'meh'.  I've had better Mexican/Tex-Mex at chains.  I don't expect much from those and in comparison- easily get better.  Really disappointing.",

I had no idea of the reputation of this place, I just knew it was supposed to have really good Mexican food.   I had the shrimp tacos.  They were very good, but kinda salty. They had three kinds of salsa. Oddly, the mildest one was the tastiest. ( I LOVE spicy food.)  I enjoyed the food, but I suspect that I did not choose the \"WOW\" items on the menu...  The place was extremely busy and full, and thus, kinda loud. Our waitstaff was  distracted/forgetful, and not as on the ball as I would expect. Must have been a very busy day.  I see mention of bottomless mimosas and all you can eat tapas....THAT has my attention. Maybe next year I'll get to check them out.",

    "text": "I lived in Vegas for ten years and tried several different brunch places throughout my time there. However, no place comes even close to Border Grill when it comes to brunch! I love this place and always have a fun time there. I prefer the Mandalay Bay location to the Caesars Palace one, just because this location has the option to sit outside and you are located right next to the Mandalay Bay pool which is nice. The absolute best part about this bunch is the $10 bottomless mimosas. I still do not understand how it costs so little to drink so much! They just keep bringing them out and it's not just OJ - they have at least 10 different options of juice for you to try (and if you stay long enough you can typically try all 10!) Is the food the best I've ever had? No. There are probably other places in Vegas where the food offered at their brunch is better / more gourmet. But it's good - especially if you like Mexican. And oftentimes when people go to weekend brunch in Vegas, they are hungover and this is pretty darn good hangover food. Biscuits. Cheese. Churro tots. You catch my drift. If you are on a diet / trying to eat healthy, this is not the place for you. There are limited healthy options although surprisingly they offer a fair amount of vegetarian dishes on the menu. Great place for a big group of people as they just keep on bringing out small plates and if you need anything extra, they will bring that out for you. Flat rate of $34.999 per person no matter how much you eat. I have never had a bad experience here and, like I said, I've gone several times over the past decade. If you are visiting Vegas or even if you are a local, this is a must-do brunch that you must try!",

On the menu it said that it was served with a basket of fruits and pastries.   I never received my fruits and pastries.   When the pancakes arrived I was very disappointed in the COLD BACON.  I mean, COLD.  Could they not even microwave it?  Also, I was not given the option of adding my own syrup, the pancakes were already drowning in syrup.  I don't like that much syrup, but the waitress disappeared, never to be seen again until she dropped off the check later.    There was so much syrup on my pancakes that the top pancake literally disintegrated.  I tried to eat some but it kept triggering my gag reflex.   I ate some of my husband's food, hoping the waitress would come back and I could order something else.  Finally, I gave up and pulled out the middle pancake and ate it because it wasn't quite so wet.  When the waitress finally came back, I complained about the pancakes and she scowled.  She didn't offer to bring me something else, or refund my money, or, I don't know, maybe bring out the pastries and fruit that were promised to me on the menu!  I didn't feel like I had the right to really press the issue because I had already eaten about a third of it.    To add insult to injury, that pile of crap cost me TWENTY DOLLARS.  My husband was embarrassed that he had been talking that place up to me.  It's a week later and I'm still feel nauseated every time I think about those nasty, nasty pancakes and that cold bacon.    There are too many good restaurants in Vegas to put up with crap like this.  SKIP IT!",

My husband and I hosted our wedding \"reception\" here at their upstairs partially outside patio (with 50 people).  Our ceremony was at Mandalay Bay and we wanted to host a lunch at Mandalay Bay.  We were scared off by the ballrooms (sterile environment, boring menus and high prices).  We didnt need the dj/dancing, garter/bouquet toss... We just wanted great food and drinks and have fun, which is what Border Grill offered.    Plus, their catering menu was reasonably priced compared to the other restaurants in Mandalay Bay.  Their staff was always great to work with and we were impressed that everything they promised was executed perfectly.  Everyone ranted and raved about the food, drinks and service... and were pleasantly surprised we chose Mexican food as it is not something any of our friends and family had ever served.  The ONLY reason they get 4 stars and not 5 is because other times we've eaten there, the service was average and the meals were over priced.",

Myself and 2 friends were here for MMS and we were all underwhelmed with the food and service. I got the fish tacos and they were dry with the taco tasting stale.  I've had better rice from a grocery store packet. My friends meals equally fell short.  We opted for the guacamole with the chips  and it was slightly brown with too much sour cream or similar oily ingredient added.  We all made the comment that we could do better at home.  The wait staff seemed to not really care about their job and were very non-personable. Maybe it's a Vegas thing.  My advice is to skip this obvious tourist trap that is using the chef's and Food Network's name to sell mediocre food and souvenirs.",

    "text": "Had dinner here with the BF prior to seeing the Lion King. Of course did a quick survey of Yelp reviews prior to dinner to make sure we weren't walking into a minefield.  Actually the prices were quite reasonable, even taking into account being in Vegas...appetizers were $8 to 12, entrees $20 to 35, and desserts (which we didn't have room for) were all around $8. Plus their \"prix fixe\" deal is pretty good at $39, considering that you aren't limited to certain entree or dessert options as per usual (hence the quotes) but can pick anything off the menu. So pricewise not out of line for any nice big city downtown restaurant.  We were brought chips and a selection of salsa verde, a chipotle salsa, and a \"regular\" hot salsa. The chips were good, freshly made and crunchy and not greasy. The salsa verde might be too acidic for some, but I like vinegar...the chipotle salsa was quite good too.  We then split a queso fundido appetizer that was surprisingly large (easily could have been split amongst four). The queso came out bubbling and with a dollop of guac. Suffice to say I would have licked the serving platter if I could have gotten away with it, but I had to settle for using the flour tortilla (also yum) instead.  Our entrees (tecate carnitas and cochinita pibil) were also surprisingly large. I can't resist me some good pork, so I was in heaven with the carnitas. The BF's beef was also awesome, the only thing I thought was just ok was the rice, but I have a hard time liking anything but short grain white rice, you know how Asians roll.  Everything was full of flavor AND in large portions. The atmosphere is appropriate for the price, and our server was prompt, attentive, and even threw in an intermission tip for while Simba was taking a breather.  A good choice for some upscale Mexican prior to a show at Mandalay, or even just in general!",

My thought was why didn't you make them move 30 minutes ago since we knew what was going before they were all even seated- he said they couldn't physically remove them- yes that's True but they could have denied service but they didn't... They still got their drinks and chips while we were standing there waiting. I just felt like this could have been handled better- I kept having to walk over to see what was going on... They weren't coming to me or at least bringing us chips while we waited.

Ambiance: being what it is; just a quick stop on your Vegas food tour- with a limited menu, it's got great Ambiance. The walls are painted it with whites, mustard and rust tones with interesting pop art. The wood detailing in the walls and ceiling is amazing! My only caveat is, if you are coming during lunch hour, it gets quite loud!  Service: Our server, Tamara,  was very pleasant, accommodating, and attentive. Even though the place was packed for lunch, we did not feel like we were to be rushed in and out. With modifications being made to our dishes, she was very accommodating and nice about it. Which was appreciated!  Food: I could rave all day about their chips and salsa! There's actually FOUR different types of salsa, but you have to ask for the spiciest one, and I hear it doesn't get made every day! But so worth it! I highly, highly recommend the chipotle chicken quesadilla! I feel like I died and went to heaven with that quesadilla! The flavor was so robust but not overpowering, and the tortilla was perfectly grilled, with just the right amount of crispness.  All in all, a great little pit-stop on our tour of Vegas!",

He was cordial, welcoming, personable, and well educated on the menu and the restaurant as a whole. Big thumbs up on Marlon! Border Grill is lucky to have him. He is a model of what food industry service should be like.  We had the off the menu ceviche tasting platter, a lot of salsa especially the green, as well as the refreshing sparkling blood orange drink and the pomegranate lemonade.

From the start she was extremely welcoming and warm, I felt as if she had us as guests in her own home. She was very knowledgeable on every aspect of the menu and drinks, as well as the source of all the food. It was so neat to hear of how everything is house made.  She also has quite a challenge with me as I was very indecisive on what to drink/eat this evening, and she heard what I was looking for and made excellent suggestions. I left tonight full and happy, I will be returning in large part to Tara. Thank you for treating me and my boyfriends family like your own, we hope to see you soon!",

You have to talk loudly to the people sitting at your table. Just sitting there in all the noise was a little stressful.   Then being seated they asked us if we wanted guacamole. It looked nice on the plate, but it didn't have much taste. I would not waste your money on it.   I ordered the pork dish which came with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. The dish came beautifully arranged but there was so much fat in the pork that it was hard to eat. I found the few pieces that weren't so fatty to add to my flour tortillas.   Their watermelon margarita was ok. Nothing amazing to write about.   Service was ok. I think we saw our waitress 3 times. The nicest person was a tall, thin gentlemen who kept filling our water. Thirsty!  He was very friendly and had good customer service skills.   Overall, i would recommend you find a better Mexican restaurant on the Strip.",

The weekend brunch at Border Grill features all you can eat small plates and optional endless mimosas, while overlooking The Mandalay Beach Club. What could be better. Do tell the server which items you would like, because without direction they just keep bringing you plates of food whether or not you want them.   Our favorites were the skirt steak and egg, the shrimp and grits, the chilaquiles, the sweet corn tamales, the chicken and waffles, and the spicy chicken enchiladas. We were totally full before we could try the other dozen or so choices.   Be prepared to take a long nap after this food and wine orgy,  Two Hot Tamales, you are the greatest!",

    "text": "We had lunch here are after a trip to the Bodies exhibit in the Luxor next door.  It was a Wednesday around 2 and it was dead! When we arrived only one other person was eating so we were able to chat with our waitress for a bit.  Im pregnant and obviously can't drink so she suggested the blood orange lemonade refresher and it was amazing... I didn't even miss having a cocktail! We decided on the guacamole to accompany the chips and salsa the give the table as well as the green corn tamales.  The guac was thick and chunky, just the way I like it.  The tamales were delicious, nice and sweet with plenty of whole kernels... They did serve it as just a mash versus a traditional filled type and they were a bit soft, they had to be eaten off the wrapper as opposed to being able to roll them out.  I had the carne asada tacos and my husband had the yucatan pork.  I loved mine, 3 small tacos with small bites of steak with the perfect amount of spice.  My husband enjoyed his pork... He said it had a great unexpected cinnamon flavor that was nice as well as it was served with cooked plantains yum! Both dishes came with 2 types of rice and refried black beans.  I suppose they're a bit more sustainable but I do miss the good ol' pinto beans I'm used to.  The only down side was since it was so slow everything came out within about 15 minutes of placing our order, but no biggie since it was all amazing.   Something I noticed on the menu is everything applicable labeled gluten free as well as \"80/20\" which indicates that at least 80% of the dish made from plant based ingredients (Not that either of our meals were!).  Border grill is located in the stretch of restaurants going towards the convention center or the shark reef.",

I was a little nervous eat first when they went to go seat us outside on it was 45 degrees outside.  With the heaters on it was completely comfortable.  Our server was amazing!  I asked his opinions on drinks and food options and decided on his suggestions.  He was on point with everything! I had the Border Ceviche, which was amazing!  Tasted so fresh with a subtle hint of spice. My husband got the Pastor tacos and the Brussel Sprouts. The sprouts were so delicious that I kept eating them so slowly, I wanted to see if I can break down what was in them so I can replicate it when I got home.  I was extremely happy with our meal here and wish we had one close to our home.",

When i arrived at the restaurant, the waitress took our kids order and then she told us that the restaurant ran out of Champagne. They wanted me to pay for mimosa when they didn't have any. Very upset, since that was one of the reason I chose to eat there.  They did not try to decrease the price or substitute for something else. Feeling disappointed and not sure if I want to return there.  What restaurant runs out of champagne for Sunday mimosas???",

I had the ceviche trio which was the serving size of a full order but split into three varieties.  If you only want to try one I'd recommend the baja ceviche it's very lemony which I loved and classic. But if you want a little spice but just as delicious go for the Peruvian ceviche.  Also tried the green corn tamales and although it's 3 small baby tamales I would order then again and again that's how tasty they were and I've had many corn tamales in my life.  The michelada complimented the ceviche nicely, I had a model instead of the tecate.  The carne asada quesadilla alone could fill you up with out the side of rice and beans which we did not try. The meat was very well cooked and tasty.  All around, I could eat here every day and be extremely happy which coming from me someone who doesn't like to eat the same meal or type of meal more than once a week it holds some weight.  I recommend this to everyone!",

Saturday May 6th was our most recent visit. The bartenders are awesome and we are obviously fans of the all you can eat small plate brunch and mimosas. Very different plates from one to the next but all equally enjoyable. I am obsessed with the tres leches french toast and my boyfriend can't get enough of the shrimp and grits. A big thanks to the Brunnet bartender who always helps us and is genuinely in such a good attitude! We appreciate you and see you guys next time we come down from Utah.

You can sit at the tables overlooking the pool, pull up a stool at the bar or tale the food to go. Everything is a little pricy, but the food was worth it! Dining in is a little dressier at night, especially with the crowd who is going to a show that night.  We tried the steak quesadillas and the chicken nachos. The steak quesidillas were good. They were gooey with big chunks of steak and a side of sour cream and guac. Yum! The real winner though...the nachos! Flavored chips piled high with loads of cheese, beans, chicken, sour cream, guac, and pico. They were delicious. I really appreciated the quality of the cheese. No processed cheese here!",

What we had: Beef Brisket Taquitos: 4 stars (5 stars for plating) Yucatan Pork: 4.5 stars (4 stars for plating) A Tecate and a Corona  re: food - one of the nice things about Border Grill is that they clearly place an emphasis on consistency.  I've frequented their LA location, and noticed no difference in the style or quality of the food.  This shows great management.  Beef brisket taquitos were very good (but sauce was too mild for my spicy-loving tastes); Yucatan pork was the winner.  I also love that Border Grill doesn't overcook rice.  re: ambience - typical Border Grill decor, but not their best location.  Patio overlooks the \"Lazy River\" at Mandalay Bay - a slow-moving waterway filled with children and extremely fat adults floating along in inner tubes.  I cam to think of it as the \"River of Pee,\" but I digress...)  It was pretty warm that day.  The gigantic fan outside is misleading; it doesn't seem to do anything to circulate air or cool the patio down.  Seems poorly designed.  It was also a little loud thanks to the packed pool.  But not awful.  Inside probably would've been the better choice, and we chose incorrectly.  re: service - Border Grill Las Vegas delivered big on service with a fabulous plus host/waiter (we thought the charming man who seated us was the host, but we later saw him waiting on another section.)  Our waiter was also attentive without being over-bearing.  Never had to wait for anything or ask twice.  re: price - cocktails looked to be about the same as LA prices.  Food had roughly a 20-25% Las Vegas premium over LA prices, but I suppose that's to be expected because 1) it's the Strip, and 2) they're probably trucking a lot of fresh ingredients into agriculturally-challenged Vegas.)",

I am the Cooking/Food Network one of the family so I am very familiar with the \"Two Hot Tamales\". When I found out that Border Grill was here in the Mandalay Bay; it was a must go to while we are here.   Last night I made reservations for 2 at 7:30pm and we were seated within minutes (they had to bus and set up the table) on the outside patio against the balcony.  Great view, nice breeze and very comfortable.   The Chips and 3 salsas came right away along with the water, our server Autumn throughout the entire evening was \"Stellar\"!  Appetizers and drinks were ordered after having the items described to us very clearly: Blood Orange Mojito and the White Sangria (I also tried their Cinnamon chipotle margarita! WOW that was soooo good!)   Autumn (our outstanding server) explained many of the dishes to us; convinced my husband to the Tasting Small Bites Dinner ($45 pp) and I ordered the Chicken Mole Verde. What a Gastronomical Delight we BOTH had! I had fun watching the parade of \"small bites\" coming to our table as I was enjoying my free range chicken, pumpkin seed mole, watercress and the Peruvian corn.  Did we have room for desert? Sadly I have to admit that we \"Topped\" out. But what a great treat this dinner out was.    Again I will state emphatically ... our server Autumn was an absolute treat! Helpful, fully knowledgeable of the menu, willing to banter with construction folk, etc. Kudos to you autumn! Border Grill is a place we will enjoy coming back to.",

The meat tasted like it had been made long before, and just reheated and plopped onto my taco.  The fixins with the taco also were unimpressive. Service was very slow downstairs. The second day, I did the tuna tar tar which was delicious, glad I gave it another chance.  Service upstairs at the bar was far better than downstairs too.

Yep, they are indeed the chefs featured on Bravo's \"Top Chef Masters\"! Being huge Top Chef fans, how can we resist?  As with all restaurants in these large hotel/casino/resorts, Border Grill was tastefully decorated. In hindsight, I wished we sat on the patio, which supposedly overlooks Mandalay Bay's beach and pool.  We started with chips and salsa, as well as a good old Margarita.  We had the following dishes:  Oaxacan Strip Steak - seared 16 ounce steak, mole colorado, charred wild mushroom quesadilla, avocado tomato relish  Yucatan Pork - achiote pork slow roasted in banana leaves, caramelized onion, orange, cinnamon, honey lime yams, caramelized brussel sprouts, pineapple jicama salsa  The Yucatan Pork dish was quite tasty, although I was only able to have a few bites.

The vibrantly colored, upscale Mexican restaurant with cuisine created by celebrity chefs Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken has been a legend in Santa Monica for decades, but they recently expanded their business by opening a new restaurant in Downtown LA, sending a food trucks out into the streets of Los Angeles, and launching a location in Mandalay Bay. I'm happy to say that the Vegas version of the iconic restaurant lives up to the reputation of the original created by the \"Two Hot Tamales.\"  Stuffed Plantains, Chile Rellenos, slow-cooked Carnitas... the menu is made entirely of perfectly crafted Mexican deliciousness. And their strong, flavorful, and Margaritas are unforgettable (unless you drink too many, in which case you'll forget more than the drinks you had at the restaurant).  The Mandalay version also features the same energetic and colorful graffiti art  on the walls that the Santa Monica version is known for, with views of Mandalay's pool area.  I love The Border Grill so much and the Vegas version does not disappoint.",

    "text": "This place was just ok. We sat outside and it was very loud but that is not the restaurants fault. We loved the chips and salsa and were looking forward to our meal. I ordered the fish tacos and hubby ordered the short rib enchiladas. I was shocked to see my tacos, they were so small, like an appetizer, the tortillas were smaller than fajita sized tortillas(which is the size I expected). There was a chunk of fish in each taco( there were 3) but the piece of fish on one of the tacos only covered half of the tortilla. So, I take a bite and although presentation was good, these tacos were so bland to me. I tasted a hint of lime but that was about it. Hubby said he would rather eat Taco Bell! He said the taste wasn't horrid, but his dish was way overpriced. Service was horrible, we were  checked on once during our meal by our waitress. We had more interaction from the bus boy!!  The water we were served was barely cold, after filling our glass once, we were given a carafe of room temperature water. I guess their ice maker was broken. We ordered the guacamole, it was good, but way overpriced as well. It came with two oversized chips to which hubby and I both exclaimed \"that's it?!\"  Maybe we both got bad dishes, or the chef was having an off night and forgot to season our food. If you are recovering from the flu and need bland food, I highly recommend this place. :)",

We sat indoors, there was a wait for the patio.  Carmie, our delightful server, came right over to the table and introduced herself. She took our drink orders, mimosas for the ladies ($8 extra for endless) and coffee for the gentlemen. We all decided to have the brunch. It is very cool how it is small plates, like a buffet, but you never have to get up from the table. At this point Carmie took over our experience. She anticipated all of our needs, she took the liberty of starting us off with a few things, and when she saw that we were all sharing and passing plates and having fun, she just kept them coming. She brought mimosa refils right on time. Just as my colleague was about to place his empty coffee cup on the table, she was filling it up. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Before we knew it we had tried one of everything. Carmie asked if we wanted seconds on anything. We ordered two more things and tapped out.  Outstanding service!! The food was so good that I didn't even think to take pictures of it.... everything was incredible. Must trys: brisket omelet, breakfast fries, French toast, biscuits and gravy & of course ALL THE MIMOSAS!!! Thanks Carmie!!! We'll be back!",

There is something for everyone: savory, sweet, boozy, whatever. I won't go item for item since the menu is constantly changing, but we had our post-wedding brunch here, and everyone left happy -- from foodies to folks who associate \"Mexican food\" with Chi-Chi's.  Sit outside by the pool. I haven't found a better brunch spot in Vegas. They were insanely helpful with the group for the wedding, and service is always on point.  They appear to have done away with their bacon bloody mary, which if True would be tragic, but I'm sure they can recommend a suitable substitute. For brunch, this gets my highest marks.",

Eating this made me wonder why mushrooms and creme sauce are not employed more often in enchiladas. Overall, it was excellent.  Importantly, nothing was too spicy.

Even though there were some vegetarian options on the menu, it was mostly cheese based.  We ordered several dishes.  It really didnt look like anything was made at the restaurant.  Some of the items tasted like they were from a heat and eat box.  Their deserts definitely didn't taste fresh.  Sure other people may like the food, I personally do not prefer it.  There's a cantina up the strip I find a lot better than this place.",

    "text": "Everyone else was feeling like a baller.  Saturday night was the night that many of my Vegas cohorts decided to go spend $100 on dinners at fancy pants restaurants that me and my broke ass last minute trip to Vegas self couldn't afford.  I wanted to eat a nice meal, but one that I could afford, so a few of us ended up at the Border Grill.  I was pleased with our choice for sure.  Dining on the patio in the heat with the misters every so often cruising our way, it was a gorgeous time of dusk to dine.  Sipping on my Cruzan Mojito and enjoying my two appetizers, tortilla soup and plantain empanadas, I was just reveling in the fact that this meal wasn't going to break my bank.  It felt upscale, but the average $25 entrees were reasonable.  Everything about the service, location, drinks, and all the entrees on the table had a hint of class to them, I was just stoked to be able to afford them....this way i could go and, instead of spending $100 on a meal, just hand the money to the blackjack dealer and say, \"here, I think you need this more than me\".  That experience would only take 5 minutes, as opposed to the 2 hour or so meal i could have enjoyed with it.  I mean, you see my point right?  5 minutes i can deal with...2 hours of tasty food...yah, like ill ever get that 2 hours back.   OK...ill pull the bitter back, and just say that it was a delightful choice for a meal.  Company included.",
