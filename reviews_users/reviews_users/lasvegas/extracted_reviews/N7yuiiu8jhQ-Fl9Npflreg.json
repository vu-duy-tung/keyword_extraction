We ordered the satay chicken on the grill, comes with peanut sauce, cucumber relish and ciabatta bread. Soooo tender and delish!  We ordered the green chicken  and so ordered rice . The green curry dish comprised of green curry, chicken, thai eggplant and basil! A real authentic rich flavour! Not too spicy!   The wait staff was attentive. No complaints there.   The decor and up keep was top of the line! A real nice modern.  Must go!!!",

Maybe because we weren't dressed like millionaires she decided it was ok to ignore us? Well she got her wish with a big fat zero tip.

The hostess informed us that it would be ready in 20 minutes. We came back and it wasn't there yet. We waited around and not until we asked did they entertain us. Thats the only time they went and checked to see the status of our orders. They told us that the kitchen was behind and to come back in 10 minutes.   (by this point its already been an hour)  We walked around and came back. Only 1 of our orders was ready.   They could've done a better service in letting the customers know the situation. In addition, they should have done something to compensate for the wait and the wrong information provided.  It has now been an hour and twenty. We're still waiting for our last order.....",

She was efficient and had an awesome personality. We started with some drinks. I ordered the Thai Spice (basically Thai Tea with rum - SO GOOD). My friends got a couple bottles of Singha and wine.   You can order family style or your own entrees, like most Thai restaurants offer. I got the Vegetable Phad See Ew at a 5 spice level and it was perfection. Just enough spice, not too oily, and the tofu was fried in nice, small cubes. My friends ordered yellow curry, green curry, chicken cashew nut, vegetable phad thai, basil beef, and mee goreng.   Everyone was really pleased with their dishes. Prices were reasonable for the quality of service. Tina helped coordinate the bill and included subtotals for us. I would certainly return here for some Thai comfort during my next trip to Vegas!",

I have not tried other Thai restaurants in the Las Vegas area yet. But, I enjoy Thai food and had many opportunities to have really great Thai cuisine.   Both dishes I had (chicken wing appetizer and drunken noodle entree) were recommendations from the restaurant to be among their \"best\". But, if you've tasted good Thai, you will agree that the flavors are comparatively bland and the texture is not ideal in some dishes.   The service wasn't well coordinated, but I prefer being checked on by several servers asking/offering the same items to me then to have no one check on me.  I rounded up and gave Lemongrass 3 stars rather than 2.5, mostly because on a 5star rating, they barely made crossing over the halfway point. Honestly, 4 stars and above should be reserved for restaurants that are far better in class than their great competition, however, Lemongrass is not at that point yet - I hope they get there.  Up shot: I did like the mango sticky rice dessert. I think the interior is very nice and most importantly, the staff are very kind. But save the sticky rice, it's not a location I'd bring guests to who love Thai food. For as attractive as the restaurant is, I wish they invested more in the food.",

Early this year, my boyfriend and I booked our Aria stay with a $50 daily restaurant credit which forced us to eat at the restaurants there once a day! We went to Lemongrass many times because we liked the food and because it was open late!  The service is excellent, the waiters will be very attentive and helpful! The food ranges in prices but will generally be between $14-20 dollars.  The higher priced items will be seafood, and a couple of selections with Lobster are $110 hehe  We have tried fried rice, chow mein, sesame chicken, cashew chicken, pepper prawns amongst many others and have never been disappointed!   My all time fave is the Fu Chow Fried Rice which comes with diced shrimp, lima beans, carrots, fried rice and a delicious gravy! YUM!  Will definitely be back during our next Aria stay!",

I had the cashew nut chicken and my boyfriend had the green curry w chicken. Both were perfectly seasoned and the rice was cooked to perfection. It wasn't anything fancy or expensive and was super delicious and a perfect after show meal. The ambience was quiet and simple. Nothing Vegas style about it... But definitely amazing food and good service. Would go again.",

Nothing earth shattering. I had the jellyfish appetizer, which is really just cold jellyfish cut into strips like pasta and tossed with sesame and chili oil. Someone was WAY TOO heavy handed with the sesame oil, which ruined the entire dish.  My table ordered a bunch of spring roll and pot stickers, those were fine.  For my entree I ordered the Beef Sczehwan noodle soup with beef, beef tendon, and baby bok choy. The broth was good, a little mild for my taste, and it turns out I'm not a big fan of beef tendon, a wee bit fatty for my liking. (Who knew?)  The wait service was okay - after 20 minutes of sitting around and waiting for our check after eating we finally went to the hostess station to ask for our bill.  If you're looking for an awesome Vegas dining experience, and you should be, I wouldn't go here. It's fine if you're trapped in the casino and want some sort of Asian food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.",

But it is convient for its location right inside the Aria.  UPDATE as of 3/12/2013 I've been eating here a lot more since I moved to Las Vegas and all, and Aria is where I work. Here are my favorites so far: Yellow Chicken Curry , Drunken noodles with seafood, Chicken & Basil, Spicy Cucumber Salad, Tom yum talay, Pad Thai, Chicken corn soup. (NEVER ever get spicy level above 5, only if you dare, they will make a grown man cry and sweat lol and this goes for everything)",

It is by far my favorite curry. They have light appetizers that come in small quantity. I enjoyed the chicken satay, salmon spring rolls and chicken wings. Those were my favorite appetizers from the menu. Their seaweed salad is not the usual kind of seaweed salad you normally get at sushi restaurants. It is horrible and has no flavor. I go to Lemongrass as my last resort. I wouldn't say this is my favorite Thai restaurant. But it is scrumptious when your desparate:-) that is the truth!",

At first I dismissed this place for the better reviews of Blossom (right across from Lemongrass) but upon arrival I liked the menu of Lemongrass so decided to wing it. The outcome was surpassed expectations. The food is excellent and properly authentic Thai. Even the spice level is Thai spicy (from 1-10, 3 is a medium, 6/7 being SPICY). My favorite was the panang duck for the creaminess of the sauce and the crispy duck (skin).",

Our dumplings were amazing, by far the highlight of the meal. My wife had sweet and sour chicken and it pretty much tasted like every other sweet and sour I've ever had. It wasn't bad, but no where near elevated. We also had service issues, but they comped our dumplings and were apologetic so I'll let that slide.

First, the lobster satay, which as been the staple of every order, has come out.... well... crappy. They come out piping hot on the outside, and cold (sometimes, even still slightly frozen) on the inside. There is NOTHING more annoying, disappointing, and downright crappy about biting into something you're looking forward to, and it comes out like a badly heated frozen dinner.  Their \"very popular\" crab curry..... tasted more like curried scrambled eggs than anything else, and their \"dan dan noodles\" were also absolute crap. Ugh.... HOW could you let things go consistently wrong for 2 months after 3 wonderful initial experiences????  My family also managed to get food poisoning when we went on Monday, a few days ago. EVERYONE.   Sad to say, I don't think we'll be coming back here, except maybe if I have a ridiculous craving for their coconut ice-cream desert, or their Penang duck.  Please get your act together!!!!!",

    "text": "We had a group that ate here on a Thursday night.  We were seated right at our reservation time.  It was very nice and calm in the restaurant.  The lights were low, quiet music was playing and the decor was really nice.  Our waiter provided good recommendations for appetizers, ensuring that we would have enough items for our party.  We had the veggie spring rolls and chicken satay to start with.  The veggie rolls were good and the chicken satay skewers were fantastic.  I especially loved the peanut sauce that came with them - a little bit of spice, but it added a lot. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai for my entree.  The waiter told us that a 2-3 on the 10 point scale would be very spicy, so I ordered my spice at a 1 (low).  When the meal was delivered I was happy to see the pile of sprouts off to the side, as I'm not a sprout fan.  With my first bite of chicken, I was happy to know that it wasn't very spicy, but then I quickly realized that it literally had no taste at all.  Rather than a bed of noodles, I felt like the chicken was served on a bed of sprouts with a couple of noodles thrown in.  The chicken was well cookies, but I would definitely have enjoyed some flavor.  Luckily we had some sauce left over from the appetizers and I used that to liven up my meal. Our waiter never stopped by after the meal was served to check on us, and a different waiter offered coffee/dessert.",

Although it was a little pricier than what would would get at a non-Vegas strip establishment, I was happy with the quality of the dim sum food. The shu mai and the har gao were really big and totally worth trying. We also ordered some other dim sum items and enjoyed it.  The service was okay- I had to ask several times for my water to be re-filled.  All-in-all, I highly recommend if you're staying at the Aria! It was quite yummy!",

    "text": "We stayed at the Aria for my husband's birthday and decided to go here for dinner since we love Thai food. Almost everything on the menu looked tantalizing but since we had no microwave or fridge in the room, we decided to keep it to an appetizer and entree to share.   Drinks: My husband orders the Thai beer anytime we go out for Thai food and if its available. As for me, I walked in with a cup of champagne that we popped in the room to kick off his birthday. I was worried they wouldnt let me in with it and I would have to down it at the door but we were seated with no issues and no wait! (We did have reservations for 9pm)   Appetizer: potstickers, they were good but I've had better.  Entree: crab fried rice with a fried soft shell crab on top. We ordered spicy level 5 since he said 3 is pretty hot. We like our food spicy but this was not spicy to us. We had to add hot chili sauce to it. Crab was very fresh and light.  Not as flavorful as I'm used to for it being Thai food but it was still good but what lacked in flavors made up in the ambiance. What a beautiful place!   I probably wont return again but only because there's too many other places in Vegas to try to be repeating the same place twice.",

The waiters/waitresses were very attentive - always refilled our waters and checked up on us constantly. The food however was rather disappointing. We already expected everything to be overpriced because that's just how it is.   We ordered something light before our flight back home. Chicken pad thai and dan dan noodles. I already had a feeling the dan dan noodles weren't going to taste very good because this restaurant was supposed to be a Thai restaurant. Dan dan noodles is Szechuan cuisine. Just looking at the dan dan noodles once they were placed on the table, I knew something was wrong. Where was the chili oil/flakes and minced pork? It looked more like peanut noodles to me. These were probably the worst dan dan noodles I've ever had.. it tasted nothing like it at all. The pad thai was pretty good. Not too strong of a flavor, but was very generous in its portions.  The flavors still however cannot justify the $18 per dish.. lol. Overpriced and unsatisfying.",

We stopped in for a late-ish snack, so getting a table was smooth enough.  We ordered the shanghai soup dumplings and of course the pad thai.  The soup dumplings were the worst soup dumplings I have ever had. They came in these strange foil cups, suggesting they were not steamed in an authentic fashion. They tasted much more like frozen regular pork dumplings and contained little to no soup, far from authentic, and below average at best. I suspect trader joe's frozen soup dumplings are better.  Secondly, the pad thai portion was decent, but the flavor was mundane. We didn't get it spicy, but that certainly shouldn't hold it back. It had no sweetness, no tangy-ness, and contained veggies that I have never encountered in a pad thai before.    I wonder if the all-asian staff is ashamed of the food.",

We ate at the bar and were greeted by Tony the bartender. He was very friendly. We ordered some shrimp Phad Thai and also some fish cakes. The fish cakes were really delicious and the pad thai fulfilled my Asian craving.   I actually came back to this place a couple of hours later because my other friends were also having an Asian food craving. I had the Tom Yam Hed which is a abalone mushroom soup as well as their Singapore Noodles to go which consists of stir-fried rice vermicelli, BBQ pork, shrimp, onion, bean sprouts, bell pepper, egg, and curry powder. I was amazed by how well the singapore noodles lasted a couple of hours after a late dinner. The soup and the noodles were pretty good. At least I know that the quality of the food is consistent. It is a great place to come if you are indeed staying at Aria.",

No. However, they do it right and it always tastes good to me. I will always try to squeeze two portions of it per one Vegas trip.   Other than my beloved char kway teow, I never really tried anything else here except the chicken and corn soup and mee goreng. Friends ordered the dan dan noodle, drunken noodle, and pad see ew. I was always sticking with my shrimp char kway teow cooked spicy. Sooo good!!!  The restaurant was next to the baccarat lounge and across from Blossoms Chinese Restaurant. It caters mostly to South East Asian foods. This hotel is smart as there are tons of S.E Asians that gamble hugely here. My friend, CK, recommended this place several years back and I still love it to this day. He told me to get a fried garlic crab this time. He said it was out of this world. I didn't get it though because I couldn't eat a whole crab alone.  I'm a big fan! The service is always pretty quick, perfect if you were trying to slip in lunch in between meetings. We were in a time constraint to watch Zarkana, and they did an awesome job in getting the foods we ordered in record time.   When in Vegas and you like South East Asian cuisines-Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Singaporean, and Indonesian... Lemongrass is the place!",

When we sat down, I was surprised to learn that they were also serving dim sum (not sure if this is a regular part of their menu or limited to Sundays is often the case at Chinese restaurants) and admittedly a little wary ... as I've found that most restaurants that mix cuisines end up doing none of them well.  Thai Food - My friend ordered \"Drunken Noodle with Seafood,\" which was not bad but not necessarily good (a little on the bland side and skimpy on the seafood) ... how about mediocre.  Dim Sum - To my surprise, the dim sum was pretty good.  I didn't order much (so my review is based on three dishes only), but what I ordered was enjoyable:  (1) Leek and Shrimp Dumplings - Less like a traditional dumpling (with a distinct flour wrapper you might associate with a potsticker), but still okay; (2) Turnip Cake - Very good, and I am a HUGE fan of turnip cakes; and (3) Ginger Scallion Tripe - Also very good, and I am also a HUGE fan of tripe.",

    "text": "It pains me to have to write a review like this. A customer dining in a restaurant inside a world-class hotel and casino like ARIA should not have anything less than an amazing experience.   It began when I called the restaurant reservation number to make a reservation. I had an important dinner meeting, and I wanted my guest to have an awesome experience. I made a reservation and got a confirmation number. When I arrived at the restaurant,  nobody could find my reservation. I called the reservation line, and after talking to a representative, she encouraged me to talk to the manager. So I requested a manager, but after waiting more than 10 minutes on hold, nobody came back on the line and I hung up. Thankfully, the restaurant was not busy, so they were able to seat us.  When we sat down, I chose a bottle of wine and ordered it. I asked my guest to have the first taste. He tried to be enthusiastic. Then I realized that the bottle we received was a different year than what was on the menu. No wonder my guest struggled. I brought this up to the server, and she didn't think it was a big deal. I requested another bottle.  The meal was good. My desire is that the restaurant will make the experience better for its customers. Not plan on returning here unless things change.",

    "text": "Unlike many reviewers here, we were staying at the Aria on a group rate, so did not have a \"meal credit\" to blow.  We weren't looking for a romantic dinner, as after spending all day at her conference, the wife had to \"send a few emails, and quickly look at something for work\", which destroyed any chance of date night.  We weren't inspired by the Aria's in-room dining options, and know that Thai is often a decent choice to offer alternatives with her gluten allergy.    Make no mistake, we didn't expect a terribly authentic Thai experience.  The signs were a broad menu that included udon, sesame chicken, and pho, and the fact that their signature beverage is a Watermelon Caipiroska.  I'm not sure why their menu covers so much of Asia, as there are separate Chinese and Japanese dining alternatives at the Aria.  But, that's neither here nor there, as we were after the usually-GF Thai stuff.  Because the wife was going to be busy, we just were going to pick up and bring it back to the room.  We both went downstairs, in case there were questions my wife would need to answer.  The young lady working the hostess stand on a Sunday night was, honestly, more friendly than we expected.  She walked us through our allergen questions, quickly dispatched our order, and before we could comment very long on the what looked like young, fit, and well-dressed platform-heeled blonde twins going to the secure Tower Suite elevators with what looked like their very affectionate dad, she came out with our bag of goodies.  We just went with a straight up chicken \"Phad Thai\" (not used to that spelling).  I didn't find it overly spicy, nor did we ask for extra hot sauce to customize it with.  Even though it took a bit of time for us to get back to our room, the food wasn't \"stuck together\" like some report here.  I was expecting to be underwhelmed, and come back downstairs to grab a pizza slice or something for my dinner later, but the ($18) entree was plenty to feed us both.    So, for the ability to handle my wife's gluten allergy without worry, the nice hostess who helped us, and conveniently and quickly feeding us both for about $20, we were pretty happy.  3.9 stars",

If there's a 3.5 star button, that's what it would get. While the service and drinks were quite good, two of the three menu items we ordered were not. We started with the Prawn Rolls (good to note that these are note \"rolled\", they come out as deep fried prawns), and in general were a bit flavourless and cold.  We then shared the Duck Panang Curry which was out of this world. Amazing flavour, huge portion of duck (which was tender and cooked perfectly). Followed that with the Dan Dan Noodles - yikes. It tasted... off... like really off. Hard to explain, but definitely was not to our liking.  Overall we may give Lemongrass a try again, if only to order 2-3 plates of Duck Panang Curry!",

We felt the red curry could pack more flavor, and we missed tofu in it. They ask you to specify spice levels on a scale of 1 to 10.  Our waiter was very pleasant, and we liked the simple, elegant decor. Someone (from aria?) offered a photo shoot - they shot 5ish photos which looked great, but were super pricey ($140) so we didn't buy it.",

The hot and sour soup was very bland and not very rich, the meat dishes were very grizzly.

    "text": "Absolutely dreadful, don't waste your time.   Decided to try this out the Saturday after Christmas. Wish I hadn't bothered. The restaurant serves Thai food although you wouldn't know this as they don't display a menu outside! We didn't have a reservation but went just after 9pm and could see that the restaurant was only half full. Asked for a table for 2 when the girl at the desk finally returned and she said she could see what she could do! She managed to find us a table but really didn't seem to know what she was doing.   We ordered and this is when we should have realised there would be a problem. The table next to us asked for the manager to complain about something, we should have left then! However, I know they had only been open just over a week so I thought it wouldn't be too bad. Little did I know.   We ordered a satay and salmon roll to start and then chicken green curry. I wanted chicken satay but was told there was no chicken satay and I could have pork instead. Why could they not put chicken on a stick??? Had they run out of pre-prepared chicken satay? We also ordered a bottle of wine.   After around 15 minutes our waiter brought a glass of wine. Oh dear, but not the end of the world as this was easy to fix. He brings the bottle back and then proceeds what seems like at least 5 minutes trying to open it. I have never seen anyone spend so long trying to open a bottle of wine. I almost asked for the corkscrew myself as it was embarrassing to watch him fumble with it. When he finally opened it he then dropped the cork in the wine cooler! He certainly wasn't used to opening wine and by the way he slouched around the restaurant and didn't seem to know what he was doing I got the impression that he hadn't worked in a restaurant before.   By this point the couple at the table next to us had been sitting there around 10 minutes without a menu and if their body language was anything to go by they weren't having a fun evening.The woman next to them was sat with arms folded staring towards the kitchen too.   Had a glass of wine (this was nice) and then another. By this point I'm wondering where on earth the food was. We weren't drinking fast and I know that some sort of food should have arrived before we'd had 2 glasses of wine each. I then see a table opposite (who had arrived quite some time after us) being served food. I check my watch and it is almost 1 hour after we arrived. We call the manager over and ask what is going on and where our food was. He returns to say that there has been a problem with the order being put into the system (ie it wasn't!). I'd had enough by now and say we would like to leave and we'd pay for the wine. He tells us he'll take car of the wine for us and we leave.   This is the first time I have left a restaurant before even eating. I understand that they had only just opened and were bound to have some teething problems but half of the staff seemed completely useless and lacked any experience. There were a couple of people rushing around and looked like they had worked in restaurants before but the majority of them were clueless. No one spotted that we never had any food in almost an hour and the manager was stood practically next to us the entire time!   One more small thing, I was sat on a comfy seat but my husband said the chair he was sitting on was incredibly uncomfortable (he mentioned this just after arriving too so it was nothing to do with the wait).",

The thai omlette was a good concept but was too rich and drenched in oil; it would be much better if it was egg whites only. Our other noodle dish the drunken noodle, it came out cold and the seafood was decent. Service was mediocre, on the slow side. But the pad thai tasted great!",

    "text": "overall- OK, not the best Thai restaurant ever. I have tasted much better. Also, the portions are very, very small. I would recommend this for couples. On the expensive side.  By the way, I would definitely recommend reservations if you are reading this. The concierge at Aria said they didn't take reservations...but they did, and we had to wait 45 mins. :(  The service was not very good first of all. My family tried to get a few bowls so we could share the dishes, but they didn't give it to us until we asked a million different waiters ( exaggerating, of course). We were wondering why the waiters were standing around chilling when we asked for bowls...?!  Anyways, we ordered Tom Yum Goong, and Tom Yum Tay ( or something like that) and they basically tasted the same. Tom Yum Goong was a little bit sweeter though. You can choose what spiciness level you want.   We also ordered soft shell crab fried rice, satay chicken, and creamy red curry with prawns (I forget the name in Thai).  Fried rice - I thought it was good, just a bit bland. My family thought it was nothing special. Comes with fried crab pieces on the side.  Satay chicken - the chicken was good, but the peanut sauce wasn't. The bread was good though.  Curry - I thought this was probably the best part of the meal. Delicious. Creamy. It was small, and came with only a  few (maybe a bit more) prawns.  The restaurant was very high class ( in Aria ) and a bit formal dress is probably good ( not necessary, though )  Hope you enjoy this review and it was helpful!! Also, thank you to the first reviewer for helping my family and I decide what to order.",

The Pad Thai was decent and the yellow curry had alot of onions. I did enjoy the crab omelette and drunken noodles though. I also LOVED the watermelon vodka drink.

My husband was starving and intended to order 2 dishes.The first thing the waitress pointed out was the serving portions are \"really big\" and there's no way he can finish it. The waitress even pointed to another table to inform of the size of the dish. Anyhow, he only ordered 1 entree (Won Ton Noodle Soup) and ended up ordering an appetizer (pot stickers). The appetizer arrived and it was very disappointing. The pot stickers had no flavor and was very dry. I'm not 100% sure but I have a feeling the pot stickers are from Costco. Moments later our entrees arrived. The Won Ton Noodle Soup was a disappointment as well. It was bland and had no flavor. Luckily, my dish (Drunken Seafood Noodle) was tasty but it was very oily. I wouldn't return to this establishment for a 2nd try. The experience was just okay and it could of been better. The waitress we had was an older lady with an accent. The wait staff who brought us water were younger and much friendlier.  We only tried this establishment because we had a food credit from staying at the Aria.",

I had the Panang Curry with Duck and honestly, it was the best panang curry I've ever had in my life. Fantastic flavor, even without the duck itself. It was so delicious, I could have eaten probably three more orders of it. We also started off with the veggie spring rolls and they were quite the tasty appetizer.  The place was pretty busy about 7:30pm on a Friday night, so we ate at the bar. Service was excellent - great attitude, very attentive. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  I will forever be going back to Lemongrass in Vegas, specifically for that panang curry!",

We had the Salmon Spring Rolls and Satay Chicken appies and they were awesome. I would have prefered a little more basil in the spring rolls, but considering I usually don't eat salmon, it was amazing. Chicken was very nice and tender - absolutely no meat stuck on the stick when removing it and served with a very nice dipping sauce.  Main courses were Grilled Pork Neck, which was very nice, but on the salty side. And had the Drunken Noodle with Seafood, which was more interesting than I expected. However, I asked for something with a bit of heat but not too spicy, and ended up with something that had 0 spice to it.  It came out to be about $35/head. Overall, I thought the appies were better... they are what bumped my rating up from 3-star to 4.",

    "text": "My best friend just to happened to have planned a Vegas trip the same weekend I was going to be in Vegas, how crazy is that?!  She was staying at the Aria and we decided on going to Lemongrass for dinner.  There was no wait at 7:45/8:00PM on a Saturday night which was great!  I would categorize Lemongrass as an Asian Fusion restaurant.  They make a bunch of different Asian dishes.  The food is good but not great.  We ordered a TON of food:  Fried Prawns Jellyfish Spicy Cucumbers Chicken Wings Vegetable Fried Rice Three Cups Chicken Beef Pho Pork and Pickled Vegetable Noodle Soup (Xue Cai Rou Shi Mian) Spicy Beef Noodle Soup (Nu Rou Mian)  The Fried Prawns were YUMMY.  The prawns are huge, and the dipping sauce compliments the flavors so perfectly.  I quite enjoy jellyfish, but this one tasted a little too water-y.  They must've washed the jellyfish and possibly soaked it in tap water, because there was an overwhelming tap water flavor when I bit into the jellyfish.  The Spicy Cucumbers were seasoned with the right mixture of vinegar, sugar and spice.  It actually tasted really similar to the appetizer you'd get from a legit Chinese restaurant.  I got the Beef Pho and was a little underwhelmed.  I felt like I got more beef, tripe, flank, and whatever else they put in my soup than noodles.  And because the beef, tripe, flank etc. looked weird, I had a difficult time wanting to eat it.  I ended up having a big pile of that stuff on my side plate.  The server seemed to be in love with one of the girls and would be SO chipper and smiley with her.  Anything she needed, he'd get for her.  I believe his name is Van.  This was a pleasant dinner, and somewhat affordable.  I think I'd rather try some of the other restaurants at Aria, perhaps the buffet, next time.",

All of us decided we wanted Dim Sum - almost every single dish that came off the cart was delicious. My favorites happened to be the Pork Buns, Shanghai Steamed Dumplings, & the Vegetarian Roll. I really recommend getting most of the dishes your first go around, so you can decide your favorites and go for seconds. That's the beauty of small plates!   Our bill would've been extremely reasonable had we not gotten multiple rounds of mimosas... oops! Overall, it was a really wonderful experience, and I highly recommend.",

It has a nice decor and an upscale atmosphere. Also, their cocktails were great. I forgot what it was called but I had this ginger cocktail that was just amazing. That being said, the food itself was a but of a let down. It was good, but it wasn't any better than other Thai places you could go to with much more reasonable prices. But the ambiance I guess made up for it.",

We started with the Crispy salmon rolls which have cheddar cheese, Thai basil, and sweet chili dipping sauce. Very good indeed. next we had the Spicy asian cucumber made with cucumber, chili-garlic, vinegar, sesame oil which was very tasty.   For our mains we had  Stir-fried pork, dried bean curd, garlic, bamboo shoots dish which I loved and my wife had the Deep-fried sea bass fillet, shallots, scallions,Yu-Hoi sauce. which was perfectly cooked.  The ambience is nice and it is not too loud even though the casino is right next door.  Service was great 5/5 and Food was good 4/5. Overall 4/5.

We were a bunch of vegetarians, so the only veggie stuff they had was steamed vegetarian bun. Trust me - it was yum, the best steam bun I've ever had.   Pot stickers - decent. Ordered the vegetable fried rice for entree. I really liked it. Not too spicy. Pretty bland but good.   Other than that.. Drunken noodles was good. Panang curry was good too.

    "text": "Wanted a convenient place to eat lunch that was near our hotel and Lemongrass seemed to fit our budget. The restaurant has fancy decor and ambience due to location inside the Aria I'm guessing. It's spacious inside and there wasn't much people dining in at the same time as us so it was pretty nice and quiet.  Food was mediocre. It reminded me of an Asian mix between Thai and Chinese cuisine, except very overpriced. They also serve dim sum, but my party was not interested. We all ordered and shared a variety of plates, which included the below:  Crispy Marinated Squid $12  Wonton Noodle Soup $16  Young Chow Fried Rice $18  Thai Crab Omelette $19  Honey Walnut Shrimp $25  I've been to traditional Chinese restaurants and had similar if not better Wonton Noodle Soup and Honey Walnut Shrimp for half the cost that Lemongrass charges. Wish they added more wontons and vegetables alongside the noodles in the soup. The rice, squid and shrimp served as decent fillers for lunch. I did not care for the thai crab omelette, but because my tablemate was hungry - she finished it.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong menu items and should have gotten more 'Thai' dishes. As Lemongrass is generally known for their Thai cuisine, maybe we messed up by ordering Chinese here. It was not worth the money. Safe to say, I won't be dining here again if I do see myself back at Aria.",

Laksa - very aromatic. Good balance of curry and coconut milk. Seafood were fresh and huge portion of season given and generous portion.   Pad se ew - nice flavour. Noodles were soft but chewy. Pork were also tender but not too soft as some restaurant marinate is with lots meat tenderizer. This restaurant still has a bit but only a small amount.   Beef noodle soup - light clean beef broth with chucks of beef brisket and tendon. Very nice flavour and soft. Noodles were ok but the pickled vegetable was the star of the dish. Intense flavour and spiciness but not overpowering.   Screw the so call international buffet in hotel on strip. Spend the money on real food such as lemongrass.",

A few more maybe, roughly chopped to disperse them, would have been better received. Same was the story with the cashews.  The sauce was nicely done to a medium spice level- I think I had the panang curry and it was good, but not quite to that next level.  My husband had the pineapple fried rice - it's his favorite in Thailand- here again just a little more pineapple would have made the dish better.

They were happy to customise pretty much anything on the menu to our preference and it tasted excellent!   The ambience, service and food were all great. The price was an added bonus, unlike other places on the strip- it wasn't stupidly expensive and the quantity of dishes more than sufficient for 2 people.  We would definitely go back the next time we visit Vegas",

Their server, manager and hostess are very friendly and also take care of every details since I walk into the restaurant. even though there are always a long wait at the weekends (so reservation highly recommend!) but it always worth.  i really like their satay, basil beef fried rice and mango sticky rice, instead, i also tried their seafood before, it so delicious.   i dont know why so many people complain this restaurant. but every time i eat here, guests always leave with smile and thank for their good food and services.   you should give them a try !",

    "text": "Best Thai restaurant in Vegas!  My girlfriends and I visited Vegas one weekend and we decided to have lunch here since it was conveniently located in the hotel we were staying at. The ambiance of this establishment is very modern with unique decors and embellishments. I definitely felt like dining in a 5-star restaurant at decent entree prices.  We ordered a few dishes to share: basil fried rice, pad thai, three chicken spicy dish along with tom yum soup. The basil fried rice was very flavorful and I could definitely taste the basil! This is probably the best basil fried rice I've had compared to other Thai restaurants I've been to. The pad thai was delish, loved that they put the peanuts and bean sprouts on the side because my dining companions enjoy the noodles without it. The three chicken spicy dish was great! Very flavorful with ample amount of meat. The tom yum was my least favorite, only because it was way to spicy for us! (But that's our fault for ordering it too spicy. They will ask you on a range of 1-10 how spicy you would like your soup.)  Our server was very friendly and sociable. She came around often to replenish our drinks. I would definitely recommend for others to try this place out if you're a fan of Thai food. This restaurant is authentic and uses quality ingredients!  Will definitely be back in the future! :)",

I should preface this review by explaining we eat Thai food about once a week, have been to Thailand three times, and consider it one of our favorite kinds of food. We like it because it's so flavorful. It's almost hard to go wrong ordering Thai food. Even Thai food in food courts at shopping malls is pretty good. But not what we had last night. The food at Lemongrass was the worst Thai food I think I've ever had. We ordered chicken Pad Thai and Tom Ka soup. They were both almost tasteless. Literally. I ate some of the Pad Thai simply because I was hungry and only had a few tastes of the soup before pushing it away. The two dishes and a beer cost $50! Rip off.   There are many excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. Don't waste your money and time on Lemongrass.",

I really appreciate the manager commenting about remaking my food but she never offered a refund. Which I was fine with my whole reason to write the review was that the food was really bad and wanted to warn other people. If they can't get it right the first time in a nice hotel. Do you really think they would the second time my experience has been no! But do try the steakhouse at the aria it is very good.",

Located inside the lovely Aria hotel, Lemongrass is a bit of a walk from the lobby but totally worth it. We didn't have to wait long to be seated and all staff were super friendly. The decor is intimate and interesting, warm environment.  Let's cut to the chase: food and drinks. We each had different drinks and enjoyed each (though I recommend the one with watermelon).  The appetizer was a let down. Marinated jellyfish (which I've had and enjoyed before) was blah. But the main courses made up for that! I absolutely ravished my spicy basil tofu and the girls loved their curry dishes.",

There is Chinese and Vietnamese dishes on their menu as well.  Large portion! 4 star. * Service: pleasant, fast and polite! 4+ star.  This is averaged to 4+ star for me. Since it opens until 2 Am, I added another 1/2 star!  We stayed at the Aria to see Jason Mraz concert... so we did not get any discount or perk on resort and food...  We came here around 1 AM and they still sit people! The service was good (some reviewers complained about the service!) The waiters were very polite and pleasant.  Anyway,  our drink and food came out at a good pace. The papaya salad is fresh and perfect. Drunken noodle is basically Thai Parseew which is a flat white noodle stirred fried with seafood in soy sauce.  The beef pho is pretty tasty. The meat is very tender. All portions are large! We were pretty full after the meal! It is quite tasty and comfort especially after a late night drinking! We were glad to have a great meal at this late beside pizza!  We were skeptical at first because of some bad reviews on yelp... but we're surprised about this place. Could not believe they got 1 or 2 star (someone must have had a bad day! )  You can easily spend $50 for a sandwich and salad at Jean Phillips and minimal $100 per person at other joints in Aria! So, c'mmon people... This place is deserved some Kudo!",

The menu includes pretty standard options - we ordered the spring rolls and fried tofu to start and the green and red curries and tom yum soup for entrees. I was disappointed at first that we were paying $15+ for food we could've ordered at the Thai take out near our hotel, but after my first bite into the spring roll, I realized how perfectly made all of the food was. The spring rolls were wonderfully crispy on the outside and the vegetable filling was soft, but not overdone. The fried tofu was equally scrumptious - crispy on the outside but inside was tofu that melted in my mouth. Both the curries had incredible depth of flavor and were perfectly spicy, with just enough sauce for the veggies and tofu. Everything served in giant bowls so no one leaves hungry. Would absolutely return!",

This is probably due to the fact it was made with water rather than coconut milk. The complex flavors that make red curry what it is were simply not there..

I was a little apprehensive because I was expecting overpriced, mediocre Thai food, but I was pleasantly surprised. My tom yum hed soup was absolutely delicious and for $8, it was a hearty, filling portion. I love tom yum soup and they definitely know how to make it at Lemongrass. You can tailor your spice level from 1-10, with 1 being super mild.  Everyone was happy with their food. I'll definitely be back to try more!",

    "text": "I come from Seattle, so Vietnamese food there is pretty top notch. That may cloud my judgment of the beef pho here, which I say is mediocre at best. The pho was not steaming hot, so it got to lukewarm temperature faster than I am used to, which is sad because I had a sore throat and hangover and needed something hot. The meat was not bad at all, but the noodles were short and clumped up, which may be due to a colder soup. The broth also had a different taste that I wasn't used to. It did not taste like it was cooked with beef, rather it had a cinnamon-y taste like it was from a soup packet. Overall, the beef pho was not to my liking. It may trick other tourists here in the hotel, but not I. Also, service was decent enough to add a star to this rating.",

Since it was close to 2 AM, I only ordered a \"Snack\" of The Tom Kha with Chicken and the Fried Mushrooms. The soup was a serving for two and there were so many mushrooms that they were mounded on the plate! Definitely more than a snack.  The Soup had great flavor, lots of chicken and just enough spice to raise a sweat. The mushrooms had a light delicate batter and a deep earthy flavor. The restaurant itself is beautiful and very wheelchair accessible. Service was friendly an efficient. I will be back for dinner next time I visit Aria.",

    "text": "After a night out and skipping dinner, we were starved! We really wanted to try the Mexican restaurant in Aria but they were closing (boo!). After asking which restaurants are still opened we chose Lemongrass.   The decor is pretty and modern. The booths are hard to get into though! You cant just slide in. On the table they have a cup with wooden/bamboo chopsticks. I personally think if it was an upscale Asian restaurant they'd be pretty and reusable but that's my opinion.   We ordered Tom Kha Chicken to start which was awesome. They didn't spoon the soup into individual bowls which I thought was odd. I guess I'm just use to Asian restaurants doing that. For our main course we had black pepper prawns, sweet and sour chicken, some kind of curry, and I think Chow Fun. All tasted good but weren't outstanding. I guess I've had better Thai/ Chinese food with better service for cheaper back home. But then again I have to give them credit for being open so late.   After adding some sodas, beers, and white rice the total was well over $100. Overall I doubt I will return even for late night grub.",

    "text": "Lemongrass is billed as the strip's first Thai restaurant at a major resort casino. The restaurant's location is ideal, tucked away from the main casino located adjacent to the high limit baccarat casino, Club Prive (high end gaming), the Sky Suites lobby, and Blossom (chinese restaurant). The decor of the restaurant is decidedly modern, with warm earth tones and decorative pipes serving as walls.   I found the food to be (not to my surprise) very americanized with the exception of the duck and yellow curry, which my party decided to order spicy. The menu allows you to pick your spicy-ness on a scale of 1-10. Because of this, I believe that the higher you go on the hot scale, the more Thai the food will taste. The pineapple fried rice and drunken noodle were bland, and were served in extremely small portions. The orange chicken however was probably the best orange chicken I have ever eaten as the chicken meat was still juicy on the inside.   All in all, I would recommend Lemongrass as a good place to eat Thai food if you care more about overall ambiance than authenticity of the food. Its location next to the Sky Suites lobby makes it convenient if you are staying on that side of Aria. As another added bonus, the restaurant is open for lunch at 11 am and is open late till 2 am so if your craving Thai food to cure your hangover, Lemongrass is the place to go.",

    "text": "We didn't really know what to expect from Lemongrass.  We just wanted some Thai food and figured Lemongrass can't be that bad!  After looking through the menu, you can tell that Lemongrass isn't a True authentic Thai restaurant.  There's more of a... Thai Chinese fusion going on here.  Still, we were pretty damn excited since all we had for the last few meals were fast food!  + Tom Kha Chicken - chicken, coconut, lemongrass, galangal.  Solid tom kha.  Not the best I've had but it's solid.  We had 4 and the portion is good for a bowl of soup each! $8 + Panang Duck - coconut red curry, duck, ground peanut, lychee.  My favorite out of all the ones we tried!  I think the duck is fried so it had this crunchy skin and it is very good with the red curry.  No bones!  VERY small portion though, and the curry is more of a paste.  Lychee sits on the side. $20 + Drunken Noodle - spicy rice noodle, prawn, scallop, squid, Thai basil.  Good to share.  Lots of fresh seafood.  We were actually surprised by the amount of seafood! $20 + Three Cups Chicken - bone-in chicken, ginger, basil, sesame oil, Shaoshing wine.  Yes yes, I know this is not Thai, but we did want something Taiwanese for whatever reason so decided to go for it.  Biggest disappointment out of all.  The chicken is fried then stewed in the pot with the ingredients, but the flavors of the garlic and ginger didn't really penetrate through.  Maybe I'm just a little picky since I love this dish normally :P $16  The Thai dishes we ordered were all pretty solid so definitely going that route next time.  We knew it was gonna be expensive and it sorta is.  $20 for the noodles and curry, $16 for the chicken, and $8 for the soup.  We also ordered jasmine rice & brown rice to go with our meal and each portion was $3.  We didn't try any of the alcoholic drinks since we were still sorta recovering from the night before.  Fountain drinks are at $4.50.  Again, a little high but at least there is free refills!  Service was good and the decor/ambiance of the place was pretty nice.",

It was conveniently located in the Aria hotel where we were staying so we decided to give it a try since we love Thai food. The place inside is ultra sheek and modern with a contemporary flare. It's very nicely decorated with nice tables and furnishings all around. This place was delicious overall, we ordered the veggie egg rolls which were very fresh and the chicken pad thai. It's on the pricey side at $18 but you get what you pay for, the quality of the ingredients was superb, everything tasted super fresh. The only thing I didn't love is that our server asked us how spicy we want it on a scale of 1-10 but I didn't think pad thai came spicy at all? We figured we'd give it a kick and told him 5, but we really should have said 2 because our lips were on fire, but in a good way, so I can't truly complain. Next time I would just get it on the mild side. Our friends had the pho and a thai curry dish which they seemed to really enjoy.   Another plus is how fast the food came out which was perfect since we had to catch a cab to the airport and we were in and out within 45 minutes and we took our time eating. However, the place was pretty empty around 2pm on a Monday afternoon so no reservations are needed. If I stay at the Aria again, I will definitely come back. Plus, I read that the executive chef is from Bangkok which shows you that the food will be good and it was.",

Being from Los Angeles I have tried many different Thai places and where this one shines is that the chef seems to have an understanding of restraint when it comes to seasoning. Often Thai places tend to overdo a lot of the flavors to appeal to people's expectations of what Thai food is \"supposed\" to be but this place gets it right and adds a definite touch of refinement to the dishes.  I would recommend coming here if you don't mind the price 'cause if you're expecting normal Thai food portions you're going to be disappointed. I went here for lunch and I would recommend the same. Don't go here for a big dinner because you may be disappointed.  I had: Rib Eye (good, small portion), Pad Thai, Coconut Soup (really good, I usually don't like it), Mint beef, Mango Sticky Rice desert (good), & a Thai tea (muted flavor compared to the usual really sweet versions; refined)  All-in-all I do wish more Thai places seasoned their food like this but I would have to pass on eating here again.",

Not worth the overpriced price we paid for for regular Thai food. We ordered the Tom Kha soup with Chicken. Beef skew with some sauce for starter. We had Green Curry and Pad Thai for entree. The Tom Kha was pretty good, and the portion was huge. They gave us a lot, it could serve four people. The Beef Skew or whatever it was called was good too with that sauce. The Green Curry and pad Thai was very ordinary. It couldn't beat regular Thai places around here. We took some to-go for late night snacking since we couldn't finished it but we left it at the roulette table!! Dang.   It was a good new experiment but definitely not a restaurant I would recommend if you're in Vegas. I would say go for lunch or late at night when everything is close. For dinner, go somewhere else.

    "text": "Located inside Aria Hotel, next to the Bacarat area.  Not sure why they call themselves a Thai restaurant when, like most Asian restaurants in the various casinos in Vegas, they serve dishes of all diffrent Asian cuisines.  Nevertheless, I was a fan of Lemongrass -- probably one of the few good things I have to say about Aria.   The food was yummy and authentic. I particularly liked the sesame chicken, extra spicy and the beef chow fun.  The tom yum soup was also really good.   Service was horrible -- really, really slow despite not being all that busy. Decor was nice.  There are definitely better Asian restaurants in Vegas.",

One of my friends mentioned that she had dinner there once and that it was pretty good, so we decided that that was where we were going to have dinner.   The food was pretty good, not spectacular seeing as I've been to Thai restaurants that I absolutely love, but it was good. Not something that you couldn't get at your neighborhood Thai restaurant for much cheaper. Don't get me wrong though, price is not a big deal but I believe in getting what you pay for. The food was a bit overpriced but then again, what do you expect, it's Las Vegas! I ordered the Lobster Tom Kha, it was tasty. The only thing that bothered me was usually restaurants take out the inedible parts of the soup such as the lemongrass and galanga but I found myself having to spit them out while I was trying to eat my meal. My boyfriend ordered a fried noodle dish which was tasty, except it was a bit dry.   The decor was really nice but the hotel itself is really nice! The service was good. This is somewhere I might come again in Vegas but not really as a first choice.",

Not on the level of other restaurants in this price range.    Pot stickers appetizer, ribeye for me, some sort of spicy chicken soup for her, and two  \"specialty\" drinks came to $75 with tip.  I'd go back.",

Ordering here, we asked for a 10 and they definitely delivered. The server at the bar, tony I think his was, was extremely helpful in making dish recommendations.  I had the Beef Basil Fried Rice which was really hot and fresh. My friend had the Green Curry based on his recommendation and it had great coconut flavor.  Will definitely go back again next time I'm in the area!",

The ingredients they use are fresh, but unless I came on an off-day everything is WAY TOO SALTY.  I ordered the Tom Yum soup with Tiger Prawns and Basil Pork over steamed rice.  I couldn't believe how salty everything was, it completely overpowered any other flavors (e.g. lemongrass, basil, etc).  I wanted to wash down everything with water, but the waiter only came back once to check on me.  Given the number of choices you have in Las Vegas, I would avoid this place.",

The background music was so soft and boring my boyfriend and I thought we were going to pass out at the dinner table. We expected a little bit more excitement for our dinner. I ordered the sesame chicken and I thought I was going to get chicken with more ginger and garlic flavors, but instead I was served a huge plate of super sweet fried chicken. I was also disappointed because rice or vegetables weren't accompanied with the meal and the server didn't offer any side with the main dish. Luckily  I was with great company and we made the most out of our dinner experience but I don't think I will be visiting this place again.",

When we confronted her regarding the sudden change she began to argue and tell us that there was no solution, only after we asked to see the manager who came after 15 more minutes, did we get possible seating solutions.

Otherwise, I would have chosen a cheaper (and more authentic) Thai restaurant.  Very, very, very expensive for Thai food.  Four people + no drinks = $100.  I understand this is supposed to be a high-class restaurant, but was expecting a better experience overall.  Everyone's meal came out fine.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Service was okay.  Our waiter disappeared for long periods at a time, but the water girl frequented our table every few minutes.  Ambiance is nice.  Relaxing, low light.  Up-scale.  A lot of rich white guys taking their escort dates to dinner.  I would have much preferred a mom and pop Thai restaurant.  Better food, and better pricing.",

We sat at the bar and our bartender was fantastic.  He made us his signature watermelon cocktail, and was great company at 1:00 in the morning.  He gave us great advise on what was good on the menu.  We had the spicy asian cucumber salad...AMAZING...for something so simple, it was soooo good!  We also had the yellow chicken curry and basil beef fried rice, and simply put it was fantastic.

At one point during the appetizer, my server stopped by the table to ask if I had received my drink (he should probably know that, right?); when he was informed that I hadn't, it didn't exactly put a spring into his step.  I still had half my cocktail in front of me when dinner arrived, and with it, the wine we had ordered to complement.  The chicken satay appetizer, phad see ew moo and yellow curry were all unremarkable, and a few dollars more than you'd pay for better quality elsewhere.  I wouldn't return.",

Curry was not bad but plain white rice, to put your curry on, was a la carte at $3.00 per cup with an $18.00 bowl of chicken curry. What a rip. They don't ask you what alcohol you want in your drink. They just pour from the expensive bottle and you find out when the bill comes. Suggested gratuities on the bill start at 18%.

The restaurant itself is pretty nice looking and our server was unremarkable (I'm sorry) . As for everything else, what a sad, overpriced disappointment.  The appetizers took a while and were nothing special. My vegetable fried rice was pathetic. It was like something I made in the middle of the night with random things I found in my fridge. I don't think an Asian person made that. It's embarrassing to call that Thai food. The red curry was also mediocre at best and it didn't even come with rice we had to order it extra! Wtf. I've been to a wide variety of Thai places all over the country and this is the most disappointing place I've ever been to. The only way it could have been worse is if we got sick.",

The crispy vegetable spring rolls were only crispy on the outmost shell. Then it got gooey chewy quick. Also they charged $3 for some peanut sauce that was pretty weird. More like coconut soup with peanut butter in it than the traditional sense. Do not waste your money on it. Wanted to try the Tom Kha soup but they don't have a cup size portion available. It's go big and waste or go without. Now the Phad Thai was high on the flavor scale to me. There was an ample portion to split between two of us and still couldn't finish the whole plate. The steamed jasmine rice was worth the up charge. The ambiance is pleasant and appealing. Not too noisy.  1 drink, 1 appetizer, 1 entree $50. I've had better for half the price.",

The server was friendly and quick to take our order and all of our food came out in a sequenced order and in a timely manner. We ordered a seaweed salad and spicy Asian cucumber salad which came out first. Cold and refreshing they were - I absolutely loved the cucumber salad. It had a vinegary dressing and spice to give it a little kick.  Next came out our chicken skewers from the Satay grill which we nibbled on for our appetizer. It came with a peanut dipping sauce that was tangy and delicious!   For our main course we ordered several dishes. Pad Thai (noodles), Pad Pak (veggies), and a few other unfamiliar chicken/veggie dishes. The food came out hot and tasty! The flavors were mild in the majority of the dishes but still very good.  I still prefer the authentic Thai food you'd find in a mom and pop hole in the wall Thai restaurant. Lemongrass is a popular Thai restaurant on the strip that I would definitely recommend to tourists who want to dine at a hotel/casino.",

    "text": "Look, I know how these Casinos feel about attending to their customers' needs in the sense that they really do not care because everyone dreams of coming here which by the way is an illusion. Being a Vegas resident I have visited Aria at least 25 times since moving here in 2016. I usually go to Sage and Alibi and I have spent quite a few bucks there with an overall outstanding demeanor and generosity however on 12/14/18, a bartender at Lemongrass believed it was \"appropriate\" for him to order a hostess to kick me out of the whole entire property(Literally)-NOT BECAUSE I DID NOT PAY FOR MY MEAL but just because I was dozing off( That was their explanation). I looked around the restaurant while I was trying to understand their rationale to such conclusion and I could see people being loud and not even ordering a single thing on the menu but all eyes were on me. In a split of a second I was already surrounded by untrained and uneducated guys who believed that can exercise their \"shameful\" authority that has been given to them to order a Trespass notice because of my refusal to leave even though I know it is a public property but just to ask me to leave without just cause is completely absurd. I called MGM Public Relations Department his morning and I was transferred to a lady at Aria's Security Department who continued on from where they left off on Friday by \"preaching\" to me how the Organization has every right to ask me to leave if I was found sleeping in a restaurant and how Lemongrass is part of Aria and not an isolated establishment. I hung up on her and called the Property's Public Relations Line again and I was given John McDaniel's' e-mail  and I will be writing other Executives including James Joseph Murren. I deserve nothing but a big apology for the manner I have been ultimately treated",

Tons of vegetarian options which was great! You sit down and they come around with the dim sum cart and can choose what you would like. They have a list of all the dim sum they offer right on the table so all you have to do is ask for what looks good to you. When ordering you can say how spicy you want the food or not.   If you don't make a reservation, expect to be waiting for a table for at least 30 minutes. Very busy as soon as they open.   Minus one star for the service. The man going around with dim sum and the woman who delivered the food were both super nice, but the waiter left a lot to be desired. Never came by after the food was dropped off to see if everything was okay and never refilled our water until we were almost finished with the meal. Service can really make or break a meal and when spending time and money at a restaurant, the server should treat you with respect and give you the proper attention.",

I ordered the fresh Young coconut juice which was served in an actual coconut. I ordered the Young Chow fried rice. Which was fried rice with pork and shrimp and I added spice level 6. I love spicy. Everything was good with the rice but the shrimp had no flavor. The prawn rolls was good especially with the plum sauce. I also tried the veggie spring rolls which was served with a sweet chili sauce. I loved the fried banana with ice cream. The ice cream was on point. I didn't give them a 5 only because my rice could've had a bit more flavor.",

First of all I want everything on this menu so we will be back. The service was incredibly prompt and precise, the dining room busy but not noisy and I noticed they are open until 1am so perfect place to have that late night bowl of soup after a few too many drinks.  We had a light lunch starting with the pork satay skewers which were beautifully presented. Followed up by the assorted dim sum with three perfectly prepared and steamed buns and dumplings, better than I've had in some top end China Town restaurants in major western cities. Topped off with 2 gin martini's made for the perfect Vegas lunch!  Can't wait to return.",

The shrimp was plump. The wonton soup has excellent flavor. The dumplings were not overpowering and were fresh. The noodles in the soup was a bonus. The rib soup was crazy delicious. The beef was tender and perfectly cooked at medium rare. Their pad see ew not so exciting. The tofu was cut in small cubes and the noodles were a bit dry.   Overall, a nice restaurant for party of 2-4. Nice ambiance with a small full bar.   Check out their drink menu. They have lots of sake selections.",

That was good but not great could have been a bit sweeter. All drinks were creative and 12 dollars. For dinner we got the Red Duck Curry which is actually yellow and a bit sweet and very delicious. We also got beef pad Thai which was the best pad Thai I've ever had!! They also ask how spicy you want each dish and we got both medium which was perfect.

Food:  Nothing that stands out too much, although we did do the restaurant week for Vegas, some portions seemed to be small but definitely nothing special.",

    "text": "I am a Las Vegas local and came here with my mother, brother, aunt, and her husband. My aunt had been here before and she had said it was pretty good...so therefore we all decided to come here for dinner.  We ordered the vegetable spring roll appetizer and that was pretty good. It wasn't as greasy and the sweet chili sauce to go with it was really flavorful.  For a starter, I ordered the Tom Yam Hed soup and honestly it was an explosion of all kinds of flavors. I actually had to stop and kinda sit there wondering what the hell I was eating. I think I may have misread the ingredients because it wasn't something I enjoyed very much (the flavors were so overpowering). My brother had the Tom Kha Chicken soup and said he enjoyed it.  For my main course I had the Pad Thai with Chicken, and honestly I have had WAAAYYYY better Pad Thai here in Las Vegas from hole in the wall Thai places. I felt like it was bland and flavorless. I also asked for it to be super spicy (10/10), and honestly it wasn't spicy at all. I was actually really bummed because I figured a Thai place as upscale as this inside Aria would have some pretty banging Pad Thai...but oh well, I'm going to stick to eating my Thai food from my regular spots here in Vegas.  The rest of the family ordered different curries and they said it was ok. Oh and none of the dishes come with rice so you would have to order the rice as a side. Kinda figured since its upscale and usually upscale tends to be only A la Carte.  Overall, this place was ok. It wasn't anything special and nothing really stuck out to me. Our total bill for 5 people came out to about $170 so the price wasn't too bad. The service was great with a very knowledgable and kind staff.  So will I come back? Maybe...I'll give it another shot some other time if I happen to crave Thai and am inside the Aria.",

The wait was going to be 50 minutes so we headed to the bar and spotted an empty two top in the bar section so we asked to be seated there instead. They said OK but were very up front about how busy they were and that service would be slow. We didn't mind since we didn't have plans for after dinner yet.   We ordered the chicken satay with spicy peanut sauce - yum. Next up, we ordered the yellow curry (suggested by the very friendly bartender) and the husband got something with seafood I think. We asked for 8's because we love our Thai food spicy and what we got... was nothing short of amazing. I'm telling you that i've been to Thailand and had their curries... This is on par with the authentic cuisine.   The prices weren't terrible considering you're in Vegas and the ambience was beautiful -- white thick rope tying everything up and dark wood everywhere.   If you like Thai food, don't like being ripped off for subpar food and you're a foodie that doesn't mind waiting a bit between courses, Lemongrass is your perfect Vegas dinner spot.",

It is modern, well-lit and tastefully done up.   The wait staff was very attentive, helped us to place our order and refilled our water glasses regularly .   Being Indian, our palates craved spicy food but were advised that on a scale of 1 to 10, 4 was already pretty spicy. So that's what we picked and it was a good decision. The order included chicken satay (perfect and wonderfully presented), Thai yellow curry(very aromatic and garnished with toasted coconut), mushroom basil fried rice (yummy) and cashew chicken (tender and flavorful). All this for a total of $56.00.  Afterwards, while boxing our leftovers, the waiters included utensils and napkins, which was thoughtful.",

But the dishes that I ordered are tasty and quite satisfying. Again, the price is 2-3 times as much as regular thai restaurants, but still much cheaper than Blossom, the chinese restaurant across the hall. Recommended dish: The thai crab  omelette, the tom kha lobster soup. Pad Thai is decent. Tips: this restaurant opens till 2 AM. Actually during the high season (till Jan 1st, it opened till 6 aM) so if you need spicy thai food to work out the hang over after clubbing, this place will be waiting.",

We ordered the yellow curry and pad see ewe one night and green curry and a noodle soup on the next.  The pad see ewe was just okay in the husband's opinion, but the curries and noodle soup dish were pretty tasty.  The spice levels were just how I liked it, and it was HOT, but I kind of wished it was a bit more coconut-flavored.  Nonetheless, the dishes were still great, and they were good meals.

We had a late dinner so we didn't really have a difficult time getting a space for a party of 5. We ordered  Tom Yum for a starter.  The waiter managed to brought in the soup, 5 bowls & 5 spoons on our table in one shot. Almost perfect! except he didn't bring a ladle. He turned away but I  called his attention just in time before he disappear from my eye sight, I asked for a ladle, he replied and said \" Sorry, there's no ladle in the kitchen.!\" Seriously?? We were shocked by what he said, how does he expect us to scoop the soup with? this is just a common sense! Oh well, we decided not to ruin our night just because of that so we just started scooping it with our soup spoon. hmm... Nice Resto inside a 5 star hotel and yet couldn't afford a laddle.. After few minutes, the same waiter came back with a ladle but we were half way done scooping the soup! He probably realized how stupid his excuse was! The main entree came next..the food is mediocre but i will have to give 5 stars on the Thai Crab Omelette, i really enjoyed this one. We also had this Garlic and Lime Steamed cod. It's looks so good! but the taste was a total opposite. We actually  returned and cancelled this menu because the fish was either not fresh or not cooked well... I am mainly giving them 3 stars because of my overall experience..",

    "text": "Decent Thai, though overpriced and a lot of attitude at the door.  When we arrived we saw a hostess desk with one person standing there punching on a computer keyboard and occasionally picking up a telephone but not saying anything on it.  Listenting to messages maybe?  Anyway, she kept doing this for awhile before she finally decided to look up at me, acting somewhat annoyed.  When I asked for a table for two, she responded with \"you'll have to wait for the hostess\" and went back to her keyboard.  So this is definitely the hostess desk, there's no mistaking it, and she is the only one there.....but ok.  We waited awkwardly for about 5 minutes when another woman walked up. Again we asked for a table for two, and she advised it would be about 20 minutes.  Fine, we'll wait.   We ended up waiting about 40 minutes, during which time, one or the other of the two came up and asked for my name on at least 3 separate  occasions.  Talk about a short memory.  We also saw several people walk up after us and then get seated while we waited.   What was the deal?  Were we dressed too casually?  I'm NOT the type to dress in shorts and a t-shirt to an upscale restaurant just because it's Vegas.  We dressed up for Stripsteak the night before. But this was listed in the CASUAL restaurant category in Aria.  On all of  the hotel restaurant listings and on the Aria tv channel, they categorize the restaurants as either formal or casual, and this was casual.  And it's not like we were that casual.  I was wearing jeans and a polo type shirt.  My wife was dressed failry nicely as she always does.    Anyway, once we finally got through the attitude at the door and were seated, the service was actually very good.  The food was good, but nothing spectacular.  Being from Los Angeles, we're used to good Thai food, and at 1/3 to 1/2 of the price here.  If you live in a city where good Thai is hard to find, this might be a good spot to try, if you don't mind the attitude.",

One of the people I was eating with asked the server which of two dishes he recommended; he obliged and recommended the green curry, while basically trashing yellow curry. Well, guess who likes yellow curry? Yep, me! He noted down green curry in our order; but I made him change it cuz he ordered what he wanted, not what I wanted. (first mistake!) He suggested we have rice with the curry- okay- to be expected. Then he suggested we order the soft shell crab fried rice. It's like the guy just wanted to pump us out of our money!

    "text": "For a Thai restaurant, there seems to be a lot of Chinese items of the menu. Not a bad thing, since there are still Thai items. Lemongrass has the option to order from the main menu, order from a dim sum menu, or both.  The wait on Christmas day for my party of 4 was 10-15 minutes, which was not bad at all since it was packed. The decor around the restaurant is elegant and well placed with an Asian vibe. The booth where we were seated had a very large table (enough for probably 6-8). The condiments available were soy sauce (which was a little strong for my taste) and hot chili sauce. I liked the generic restaurant music that played in the background; it was captivating yet subtle.  My party ordered dim sum before ordering entrees. Each item on the dim sum menu ranged from 4.50 to 6.50, which is a little reasonable. The total is added to the final bill. The chicken feet (four per order) were very tender and flavorful. The sticky rice (2 servings per order) had good flavor and was nice and hot; inside was a slice of sausage, mushroom, and pork (I think it was pork). The scallop dumplings (I think five were served per order) were juicy and tasted just right like scallops are supposed to. We also had the Siu Mai (3 per order) which had a very tender meat filling, but lacked flavor. The steamed buns (3 per order) had a good flavor and the bun itself was cooked just right, but I have had better. Something that caught us off guard would have been that the carts that served the dim sum did not have normal rice. It was off guard for us because rice is the staple starch food in all of Asian cuisine, and to not have it while eating dim sum felt like something was missing (I know it's not an actual dim sum food, but having to wait for the rice to come with the entrees was a little disappointing).  From the main menu, we ordered chicken chow fun ($16) and the tofu and pork (Forgot the name and actual price, but it was $15-20). The portions were big enough to give each person at the table one serving. We were also offered rice, which we then ordered one bowl of brown rice and one bowl of white rice. The chow fun did not have a lot of flavor at all. Even adding soy sauce and chili sauce to it did not bring out a lot of the flavor. The tofu and pork did not have much flavor either. As a matter of fact, there was more tofu than pork served to us.  One thing I do not like about this restaurant would be their silverware. I had the option to use chopsticks, but our serving utensils were silver that were awkwardly heavy at the bottom. Whenever I would want to rest the silverware on my plate, the heavy handle would force the end of the silverware to hit the table. This caused a few accidents moving plates around.  Our service was OK. We were served drinks quickly and even got one round of refills. Unfortunately, whenever the waitress would stop by, she would quickly leave before I could ask for a refill. Even after we were done eating, I wondered where the waitress was to give us our check. Despite these shortcomings, our dishes were quickly cleared by the bussers, so we were not totally ignored. I was a little bummed out that we were not offered dessert.  For a restaurant in Aria, one would only have high expectations of their restaurants. The best part of my dining experience here was the dim sum, but I think with how much money we paid, the best part should have been our entrees from the main menu. I feel like I can go to Chinatown and order the same food and it would taste better than how it was made here and it would only cost a fraction of the price. Service, like I said, was OK, and I get that I went here on a holiday, but going to a place like Aria, one only expects something better than what everyone else has to offer. Lemongrass was not absolutely amazing, but left me with a little disappointment. I'm not coming back here.",

We told the lady who seated us that I was my aunt's 62nf bday so can we have some dessert out for her, then we reminded our server and even before that we had the hotel concierge call the restaurant about it buy NOTHING ! They just handed us the bill. The staff there needs to learn how to smile. Very very disappointed!!! Both in the service and the food. We were there sat Jan 6th 2018",

The decore is so beautiful and relaxing, makes you feel like you are miles away from a casino hotel while still in one. Location is tucked down a hallway from the main walkway. Service can be a little slow, and I would suggest calling ahead even if you are only a little bit away because they do get a wait quickly.   This last visit we got our all time favorite dishes: Vegetarian Spring Rolls, Lobster Tom Ka Soup and Panang Duck Curry. I of course got a glass of the Justin Cabernet, he had the best Thai Iced Tea.   They ask you for your preferred spice level 1-10 and say 3 is a medium, we got a 6 on both dishes, as we both love spicy food, and thought it could have been spicier, however be warned we have ordered the same dishes at the same 6 spice level and it was the hottest dish we have ever had, so I think it depends who is cooking that night.   Highly recommend, this is our go to recommendation for all of our out of town guests as well!",

It's as good as you can get in terms of having pho on the Strip of Vegas and Vietnamese cuisine fused with other Asian cuisines, such as Chinese and Thai.    They offer dim sum only on Sundays.  I guess it's because that is a family gathering day.  That's my supposition.  Nonetheless, they make the dim sum small plates, such as the pork ribs and tripe pretty good here.  They have chicken feet too!  Made well here as well.  Try it out!  There's no harm - you're in Vegas anyways!  The waitress who assisted us, was great.  She came by our table a lot of times and offered us dim sum too - especially when we didn't even know that they served that up!  Their broth and noodles are actually made well here.  You can tell because the rice noodles in the beef pho, for example, does not get soggy, but still noodle sturdy when it has been in the broth after awhile.    Their chicken wings are crisp and moist on the inside - well cooked all by itself!    As for their Thai dish, such as their Pad Seew Ew, it was flavorful, but lacked the ultimate umph and jalapeno marinated in vinegar zest to it.    Keep this in mind - this place is the remedy if you are craving pho or for fulfilling some good Asian food in you and you are limited within the confines of the Strip!",

    "text": "They serve super delicious comfort food that is a real treat after a long day navigating the strip. There's also never usually a wait for a party of two and they don't require you to dress fancy, so it's also really convenient. They have a good selection of cocktails which taste excellent and are usually pretty strong. Whether you want dim sum, hot and sour soup, or spring rolls, they deliver and deliver well. Their seafood drunken noodles is a pretty unique offering and when they say that it will be spicy, they mean it! I love a place that isn't afraid to serve me a truly spicy dish when I ask for it. All the food you and your partner's hearts can desire will cost at maximum $150. Highly recommended.",

Got thai iced coffee, crispy fried tofu, and drunken seafood noodle.  The portions are pretty big so i kinda ordered too much food for myself but oh well.  The tofu was good but they didnt give enough sauce for dipping.  The drunken noodle was kinda bland but they gave a lot of seafood so it definitely fills you up.  Its a nice restaurant but probably a one timer for me.  Good but there are so many better restaurants in Vegas to choose from.",

    "text": "Had late dinner here last night around 10pm. We were seated quickly but we waited almost half an hour after we placed our food order. I'd say the shrimp pad thai was probably the best dish of the night though the portion is relatively small for its price. I had high expectation for the crab omelet, soft shell crab salad and garlic Chilean sea bass but was quite disappointed. The crab omelet was way too greasy and the eggs soaked up the oil. Soft shell crab salad was too salty and too sour - the fried soft shell was not crispy either. Garlic Chilean sea bass was the greatest disappointment - it was cold when it's served. With $28, you only got two tiny pieces of fish. The seasoning was also way too heavy that you can't even taste the fish. The chicken curry was decent but not memorable - there was so much more potatoes than chicken...... if you happen to have intense craving for Thai food then this place could be okay but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it for the food.",

I have tried just about every single item on their menu, and as anywhere else I do have some favorites.   I'll start with the best of the best, make sure to order their Maine  Lobster with ginger & scallions sauce, there is a salt & pepper option but not as yummy.   Noodles, Their Cantonese chow mein is very good,  Pad Thai is good but too sweet for my taste.  Soups, my favorites are Tom Kha chicken or lobster, and their Sweet & Sour, both great, there is also a  vegetarian Tom Kha option, the Wonton noodle soup is also very good, but I like the other two best.  Dessert, sticky mango rice is excellent.  Considering it's location, and portions, menu prices are very good.   There are several excellent restaurants at Aria, however, if you are in the mood for Asian food, Lemongrass is an excellent option.  mangia!",

I personally tried the Ribeye Steak and it was delicious! However, rather than ordering it alone, I did Signature Tasting Menu which included a starter, appetizer, entree and dessert for $49!  I saw some people saying that this place was overpriced and it's not. Being born and raised here I know that to get the quality food that Lemongrass offers for the price it is at is a great deal on the Strip. Anywhere else will be extremely expensive and charge a fortune.   I definitely recommend this restaurant! One of the best at Aria!",

From stir fry to noodle soup the flavors and variety was impressive. A standout was the beef fried rice (sound generic) but seriously it had charred pieces of rib meat and the rice had a slight crunch which was hard to not keep filling your bowl. From walnut shrimp to duck curry the flavors are legit and it is not your typical overpriced casino Asian restaurants.  Service: Very attentive waiters and your water glass is never empty. For a busy Friday night, you still feel you are not being rushed. The food comes out quickly and piping hot.  Ambiance: Very cool vibe and bright enough where you could red the menu though it looks dark. Comfortable booths and tables and far enough from the casino floor where the noise level is perfect.",

We were here for lunch and ordered a red curry and tom kha soup with tofu. And here comes the important part,when placing your order the waiter would check your desired spice level,  from a scale of 1-10.Be very careful with the number you pick.we picked 7 and boy they are serious about their spicy scale!! We usually consider ourselves very decent with our spice tolerance and they managed to bum us!!! So go with 3-4 if you want a very decent ,no running nose, burning tongue  dining experience. Having said that, the food is very flavorful and delicious. The soup is amazing with flavor bursting with each sip. Their portion sizes are big. I only wish I went with a 4 or 5 spice level.",

Conveniently located where we're staying this trip, within our hotel is Lemongrass, just outside of the Sky Suites entrance at the Aria.   Pretty ambiance. I decided my friend needed to have noodles, an Asian/Filipino tradition because when it's your birthday it represents longer life and more years to come.   We ordered the dim sum sampler. Unfortunately their choices are limited on weekdays; har gow only on Friday's and weekends :( We got siu mai, 3 steamed pork buns and another spinach type of pork dim sum.   My friend also was intrigued to try the jellyfish appetizer which was okay. Served cold topped with sesame seed lightly drizzled or tossed in probably some sesame oil. It was okay as well.   The noodles we ordered were the beef pepper udon. Well obviously a little more peppery than normal. It also had green onions, white onions, and soy beans. It was also just okay.   Overall the taste was blah and non-spectacular. Maybe I've been spoiled from living in the Bay Area where there's great Asian food/ Chinese food and China Towns in Oakland and the city but I was not blown away.   The tastes were only mildly flavored. But maybe so only to cater to the different guests that arrive from all over the world? Idk I hypothesize.  I gave the third star for the ambiance because it is a beautiful venue.",

    "text": "I came to Lemongrass with a group of girls for a bachelorette party after reading really favorable reviews online.  The ambiance was absolutely beautiful. Nestled right behind the High Rollers Lounge in the Aria hotel, you escape from the hustle and bustle from the casino, and almost forget that you are in Vegas until you hear someone screaming that they've won.  The drink menu had nice options. I have the blueberry gin infused cocktail, simply because it had St. Germain which I'm a sucker for. I was satisfied but not overly impressed.  The food received mixes reviews from our party. I thought it was decent, but I've definitely had better Thai fusion food. The prawn rolls were absolutely delicious, while the pad thai definitely left me with the case of the yawns.  The service was very good. Alex, our server was incredibly nice and patient. He blessed a few of the ladies with insight of which item to choose, the menu could be a tad overwhelming for a first time visitor.   Overall, I gave it 3 stars because I'm not dying to go back, but I wouldn't be opposed visiting if another restaurant is open.",

A 3 is good range and a 4 gets kind of hot (I like spicy for 4 was good for me). It is not that pricey either.    The dessert was very good! I had the sticky rice with coconut ice cream.

The fried banana with ice cream was so good and the coconut ice cream with sticky rice too! The dumplings were awesome!! Our waitress service wasn't that great though she didn't check on us only to keep bothering us to check if we are going to pay our bill. We asked her to get us drinks and she never got them. We had to ask someone else and another waitress got us our desserts instead. But I would highly recommend eating there it's great!",

    "text": "Lemongrass is the first Thai concept restaurant within a Las Vegas casino/hotel.  The interior decoration is very beautiful.  It is located within Aria's casino level, near Blossom (Chinese restaurant).  I tried the food during the Aria \"Play Days\" (essentially a dry run for selected employees and their guest), and honestly thinks that once the initial pre-opening butterflies are worked out, it will be a good restaurant.    I tried the Tom Yum Goong (prawn soup with lemongrass), and the portion is large enough for 2 to share, and it came out nice and hot, just the way a hot soup should be served.  The flavor is good, but not knock your socks off great.  The mushrooms and prawns are really fresh, and the prawns were not overcooked like at most restaurants.  The Chef's Signature Crab Fried Rice was also very good.  It was served piping hot and the rice is not greasy like at most restaurants.  It was one of the best fried rice I have ever tried (but Ding Tai Fung's fried rice is still tops in the fried rice category for me, but Taipei is just too far to travel for a fried rice fix).  The only disappointment for me was the dessert: Mango and Sticky Rice (Khao Niaow Ma Muang).  The mango was surprisingly good (considering that the ones we received for our operation is pretty bad in quality this time of year), but the sticky rice was undercooked and lacking in the traditional coconut milk flavor. This is a very easy recipe to master, so I was very surprised that it was not made at least as good as your typical Thai restaurants.  Anyway, I took a few pictures of other dishes that others ordered, and those look good.  I can't wait to go back and try their other menu offerings once it is open to the public.",

    "text": "Know what's funny? When I'm a few clicks from Chinatown/SGV at home I rarely feel like eating dim sum. Send me to the epicenter of hookers, blow and blowing hookers and I instantly crave it like clockwork (the dim sum, not the prostitutes/drugs); it always hits right around 10:44am on the 1st morning waking up in Vegas. Pft, like I'm gonna leave the Strip to go get sum dim sum...no. NO! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GET IN THE CAR! No-oh...there's a place in ARIA?! Okie =)  Chinese-Thai fusion -- to my stomach that translates to: dim sum and satay. Asian soul food and tropical shee-at. I feel only the slightest bit bad because LG has been deserving of four stars my previous two visits but with the last one, well, let's just say third time was NOT the charm. Hehehekekekejajajaja. Amirite? Yah, I am totes rite.  Aside from ordering your typical assortment of spherical balls of crap enveloped in cocoons of some sort of rice-based skin (as an Asian I feel pretty ashamed I don't even know what I'm talking about) such as har gow, pork bao, shao mai, turnip cake, etc. you can of course get Thai dishes. No lie, we've probably ordered 90% of the same thing each visit while sometimes changing it up and subbing out a dim sum plate for something else. Can I mention how cute the phrase daan taat is? Egg custard cups...they even look adorable. If I could personify this dish I'd want to squeeze its cheeks, slap it in the face then swiftly punt it into a wall because it's just too gosh darn ky00t. Daan taat in animal form is a maltese =)  To regain focus on the foodles...the beef satay disappointed us this time around. In fact, most of the dim sum disappointed too. Did it taste skanky like a used diaper laced with pencil shavings? Nah, it tasted decent like always but the temp...argh. Such a seemingly simple aspect when serving food but tough to execute correctly on a consistent basis. All the dishes were either a couple of degrees above being lukewarm or getting dangerously close to flat out cold...clearly not the optimal temp to serve dim sum or meat on a stick in a pineapple under the sea. It's almost as though the carts were circling the depths of hell for a few mins too long...and by hell, I mean Lemongrass. And by mins, I mean a maybe a half-hour or so. The worst was the satay -- the surface temp completely turned me off since I felt like I was basically licking a cold cow popsicle...ahhhhh!  It doesn't help that without fail, at least two people order the young coconut. 12 mothafluffin' dollars per...that's a 6 or 8 place bet in crapaud =( I mean, they're alright but I don't see what the big deal is with these stupid nuts. In particular on this last trip the examples we were served weren't ripe so it was tough to scrape the meat off and it wasn't exactly sweet flavored. Kinda slimy too, akin to squid...blech.  Still, I won't let this deter me. Yes, you can bet your sweet fanny I'll be updating LG when I revisit in a few months. Plz to be turning the heat up a few degrees on your stoves and grils?",

The service was excellent, so no complaints there. The food was extremely average though, and definitely not worth the price. We ordered satay chicken and Tom Kha Gai for starters, and green and yellow chicken curries for mains (entrees). All of the meals were well presented, but extremely bland in taste. The Tom Kha soup had too much lime juice, and the curries were both almost tasteless aside from the spiciness (we ordered very mild, as we prefer the taste to the spice). The satay chicken was better, but still much too subtle in terms of flavour.  I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for somewhere to eat in Vegas, but there aren't many options available if you want Thai food. Disappointing.",

The chicken wings were the saving glory of the meal, as they were well seasoned and well cooked. The green curry was pretty soupy, and didnt have any other flavor other than the coconut. The basil meat I was most disappointed by, because you could not even taste the basil that was in the dish.",

From the freshest coconut water (I'm Caribbean so I know the difference and this is legit), to my fav the salmon spring rolls its always a delight. I'm also addicted to the pineapple rice and the '3 cup chicken'!  On those who are complaining, I honestly can't say what I find wrong and this is literally my nth time in last few years. Everyone I bring here luvs it.  Take out is also awesome.. we do this with my family quite a bit.   I recommend it for when you want some privacy, good service, a bit of class. I'll be back in 4 weeks!",

The fact that it was used in this flat noodle dish with tofu was absolute awesomeness!  My co-workers also had the Green Curry with Chicken (which they liked) and the Tom Yam Hed soup. I'll admit, I tasted the Tom Yam Hed which was spicy goodness but I can't guarantee that it's vegan because the broth tasted seafood-y. In fact, the leaf icon that indicated vegetarian dishes in the menu wasn't next to the Tom Yan Hed so that was my bad :/  Gasp!  Oh, get over yourself...\"the vegan\" just told you that a potentially non-vegan soup was tasty. That's gotta mean something, right??? ;D  P.S. The decor is absolutely fabulous! Contemporary design with ropes stretched across the ceiling. Makes me wonder...if one of the ropes were cut, will it all unravel? Hmm...",

There was a 30 minute wait to be seated, but there were empty tables and multiple staff available when were finally seated.  Once seated, service was slow, and our waiter seemed disinterested.

Our server was really nice and friendly and food was brought out appropriately rather than all at once.  He was patient with our drink orders and was able to make substitutions to some of our entrees as well.  Cocktails are all pretty good here.  I had the Watermelon Caipiroska and it was a table favorite.  Really tasty and refreshing without being overly sweet.  You can't even taste the liquor in here.  My sister had the Berry Botanical, but the green tea was a little overpowering.  The Ginger Peach was good too but the vodka does come through even with the black tea.  Wine list is decent and included a really tasty Pinot from Holdredge.  I loved how the wine list was broken down between delicate and full-bodied.  For appetizers, we started with Chicken Satay and Veggie Spring Rolls.  Satay was tasty with a really good peanut sauce, served with skewers poked into a pineapple chunk.  Spring rolls were standard but good.  For dinner, I split an order of Dan Dan noodles and Basil Chicken with another member of our party.  We sub'd the minced pork with sliced chicken, but ended up getting minced chicken which worked out just fine.  Didn't realize it was going to come out as soupy as it did, but that was OK.  The chili oil and peanut combination gave it a nice sweet and sour taste.  The basil chicken was AMAZING.... all the pieces of meat were so tender and juicy.  The flavors were amazing... we couldn't stop eating!  We skipped dessert here, but I am sure there were some treats on there.",

The servers are quite friendly, and patient. lol. The server went as far as explaining many of the dishes to us ingredient by ingredient. I went with the beef fried rice which I was certainly satisfied with. The rest of my family seemed just OK with their meals. Oh, and there was a mix up with my girlfriends dish. She had ordered a vegetarian plate, but when it showed up it had chicken on it!! She brought it to their attention and they quickly apologized and assured us they would make it properly for her. And they did do this, however, it took them forever!!! And the place was mostly empty, certainly not a full house that night.  The food was good overall, but certainly not something we are dying to have again on a future trip to Vegas. Other than the mishap with the veggie dish, service was fairly good.

There is no innovation on the menu and works well if you are looking for classic Thair fair, however then the quality leaves you disappointed for the price you are paying. For a casino restaurant, I expected more.",

    "text": "Bad service led to bad food led to a bad experience.  I said \"I'm vegan.\" The hostess manager (I forgot her name...maybe Santara or something? She is Thai, I believe.) suggested the panang curry. I aked her if it could be made completely mild. She said yes. I had my doubts, and confirmed again.  Turns out she didn't know the menu.  My takeout order came and I left to eat it. Spicy. Sweating. Nose running. Not pleasant for this Midwesterner. Didn't...couldn't enjoy the meal (which was only brown rice and tofu in panang sauce...No veggies.)  Brought it back and complained. Asked what we could do. She said we couldn't do a refund. I said fine, then how about a free dessert? She said she would \"talk to the chef\" to see what could be done. Last time I checked, the chef takes orders from the manager, and will prepare whatever. She comes back with a scoop of ice cream (for a vegan). I send it back. She coffees back with a few pieces of watermelon that didn't look all that appetizing. Gotta say, they tastes great. But, I think she should have given me a choice. If she would have, I would have chosen and been restored to good. The way she treated me, she gets yelped at.",

Though it's in a quiet corner the restaurant was very loud during our late Friday evening dinner.  Food was hit or miss with good Tom Yum Soup and thai cucumbers but bland and tasteless main courses that were supposed to be spicy.  The chicken Ka Prow was g-d awful and tasted like something in a Midwestern factory cafeteria.  It consisted of chicken with dull vegetables in a thick and flavorless gravy.  This was supposed to be a spicy dish!  Sad!    Even sadder was the service.  Our waiter took our order, delivered appetizers and then we never saw him again.  His photo might be on the side of a milk carton by now.  We just sat there for 40 minutes until a manager brought us the check with attitude as if we were interrupting her day.    I get better food and service at my local thai carryout place that charges 1/3 as much.    Management, you need to monitor what's going on in your restaurant.",

Talked to waitress and was told it is \"Thai style Dandan noodle\" and that's complete BS. This is a chinese/Thai restaurant and Dandan noodle is chinese Sichuan cuisine. I have never heard thainland has such dish.  Pineapple fried rice: just horrible. The rice is too dry and sticked altogether in trunks. The rice is unevenly stirred in the wok and you can see the color difference. I can tell it's done by an armature cook. I can cook better fried rice. Plus, I would expect at least some sort of nicer presentation of food such as a real pineapple next to it (like what lots of Thai restaurants do), but I guess not.  Would not come back and recommend to anyone!",

When we ordered from our room tablet, our food was ready for pickup in 15 minutes!   We ordered: Shanghai Dumplings - Delicious soup dumplings, the skin a bit thick for my liking but it held the soup in very well, and didn't tear when pulling the dumpling from the container (Common occurrence when ordering XLB to go) They came with 5 for 1 order.  BBQ Pork Buns - Came with 3 mini buns / order and they were also delicious. Perfect amount of Pork to Bun and the buns were soft and pillowy.  Pot Stickers - just okay, we expected them to be more crispy like the photo but they were just steamed with a tiny bit of crisp on the bottom.   We had the Mango Sticky Rice for dessert which was good, hard to mess up.   Would definitely recommend Lemongrass if you're staying in the Aria, though there is better Dim Sum elsewhere in Vegas.",

Make reservations as it fills up fast every night. Service is great, the food is delicious, signature cocktails are wonderful as well.  Be cautious about spice levels. Their scale is 1-10 and 3 is medium. I tend to like spicy food and ordered Singapore Noodles at level 5 and lets just say the burn was brutal during and the next day. Stay with a 3 for spicy and you will be happy",

We started off with the cucumbers and spring rolls. Both were very good! The young coconut drink is the best coconut water, I have ever had. I ordered the red curry with beef spicy level 6. It was pretty spicy but since I like a lot of spicy, I will go a little higher next time. The curry though was out of this world! I paired it enthusiastic jasmine rice. So good! I even had leftovers the next day and it was just as amazing. I highly recommend Lemongrass if you want authentic Thai food and a nice ambiance.",

I was at a loss gambling, so now I needed to feed my hunger pains or keep on scratching that gambling itch to try and break even. Hunger pains won obviosly.   Their menu has a lot of variety. I seriously was debating between the rib-eye, sea bass, three cup chicken, yellow curry, and so many other yummy sounding entrees.  After some thought, I really was craving for some beef yellow curry. It was a VERY tasty curry! The only downfall of it is I expected more protien for the price. There were a good chunk of potatoes, but the first one I bit into was still a bit raw in the center.   Then there's a good variety of desserts to choose from. I was about to go with some standard Thai desserts like the mango sticky rice, but the server recommended the coconut ice cream. Awesome recommendation! Such a mouthful of flavors! From the fruit to the jelly's and the sticky rice. Definitely a must try.  Service is OK here. Was seated right away, which I anticipated for this late. Food arrived fast and piping hot! I was so hungry, that first bite burned my tongue! Water glass was kept full. But also could have had a couple check-ins to see how I was doing.",

We always order the Shrimp Phad Thai, Tom Kha Soup, and their Chicken and Shrimp Satay. For dessert, we like to order their mango sticky rice and fried banana with icecream. They also serve Dim Sum on the weekends, which is delicious as well. I would recommend coming here for brunch if you want authentic dim sum. The service here is always great.

This isn't even stated on the menu. Won't be back here. Two stars because Tina, the waitress is awesome!",

We sat at the bar and ordered the jelly fish and a scallop satay. The jelly fish was interesting. I don't think I would ever order it again.  It was served chilled and doused in sesame oil. I was having a hard time with the texture too. The scallop satay was really good. It was served with a light peanut sauce, a cucumber salad and some bread. Thank goodness for the bread because the scallops were not much food, especially for the price.  The service was stuffy. The bartenders seemed like they were meh about being there and didn't really care too much about helping people. I actually would have expected way better service from a place like that in the Aria.",

I had to eat them with a fork and knife (also because I wasn't offered chopsticks). The yellow curry itself was ok, but seriously lacking in flavor. I ordered medium, and it wasn't even a tiny bit spicy. The potatoes were incredibly hard; I ended up not eating them at all.

Lemongrass is in the Aria Resort and Casino, directly across from the Chinese Cuisine restaurant Blossom. It is a open floor plan meaning its inside the casino, it is not closed off. The decor is very romantic and dim, the atmosphere and just the interior is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. I could not stop looking at how table chandelier hanging from above. Our waiter was very friendly and nice overall. However, the food took a while to come out. The restaurant did seem busy so that is probably why. I wanted to try the soup dumplings as they provided 5 for $12. I have eaten better dumplings from other places. We ordered the the three cup chicken pork pad see ew. Both dishes lacked flavor as if the chef forgot salt. The dishes were in decent portion but it really was bland unfortunately.",

My fiance found this restaurant by looking at a pamphlet they gave us at our hotel. We were staying at for the Vdara, often times we like to eat at the Aria restaurants to get our points. We were in a Thai food kind of a mood so we had to asked concierge how to get there, we were unfamiliar with the area where Lemongrass was. We showed up around 6 PM on a weeknight. We waited for a while for a hostess to come to the stand. There were also people behind us also waiting for the hostess. Finally, when she arrived we were able to sit right down without a reservation. Pretty cool environment for what you would expect for a Thai restaurant. We sat down and before we were greeted by our server, we were greeted by a photographer who took a bunch of photos from of us. Later, she would try to sell them to us in a book. The server came over and got our drink orders. My fiance got to Sapporo and I got a glass of $19 Pinot Grigio. It was very expensive for what it actually tasted like. We decided to get a few appetizers and a meal and split everything. We ordered the salmon spring rolls, the Tom Yhun shrimp soup, and the chicken pad Thai. The timing of each food item that was delivered was perfect. We stayed for about an hour, and got our entire dinner for under $100 with tax. Not over priced. Overall, the food is good, the service is OK, the ambience is kind of boring and dull. We were very tired when we left because of lighting. Overall, this place is OK. It's good if you want Thai food because it's one of the few type places around specific area on the strip.",

My favorite was the panang curry- super flavorful, loved the lychee, and the spice level was on point! Those 4 dishes set us back just under $80 which wasn't too bad. We even had a small bit leftover.  Will definitely come back to Lemongrass during our next stay at Aria to enjoy the panang curry and to try something new!",

    "text": "Being a frequenter of the Aria resort, I've eaten at Lemongrass many times...always having a great experience.   Dishes I've had most recently:  Pad Thai:  excellent!  I've had pad Thai at a lot of places and Lemongrass ranks among the best. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a lot of large perfectly cooked shrimp with my seafood pad Thai. I was kind of expecting overpriced and few shrimp given that restaurants on the strip can get away with this sort of thing. Nope. Well done, Lemongrass.   Drunken Noodles:   Very very good. Not sure what to say about the drunken noodles, exactly. Nothing stood out as being specifically good. Just that the dish was overall very very good. I mean, they're drunken noodles. They're delicious!  I don't think I've had bad drunken noodles before, but I can't see how Lemongrass can improve on their version. It was tip top.   Young Chow Fried Rice:  delicious!  My only qualm is that it is inconsistent.  They've served me the dish already mixed together and looking very fried ricey (is that a word?) but the last time I went they served the fried rice separate from the primary ingredients and had me pour the soupy-like mixture over the fried rice. I like it the first way better.  Pork Dumplings:  A somewhat small portion for $10, but some of the best I've ever had. Was pretty pissed a couple of times when they gave me very little dipping sauce in my to-go order. But not the end of the world.   The inconsistency in the young chow dish and the amount of sauce given for the dumplings makes me want to give the restaurant 4-stars. No cheap and inconsistent restaurant should receive 5-stars imo, but the food IS top notch and they didn't skimp on the shrimp (hey that rhymes). I mean, be cheap and give me less sauce, shame on you. But you did surprise me with more of an expensive seafood product.  I'll be kind. 4.5-stars rounded up.  I can use my casino comp points to pay too. Weeeee!",

I get most restaurant's are pretty pricey, but this is about average price as if you were to go to a restaurant in San Francisco, ca. We order the Tom kah soup. Very nice flavor. Minus star since they didn't ask for spice level had to ask for pepper on the side. Recommendation was the basil stir fried. Got the beef and was really good. Has fresh peppers, so does a good spice. We got a salad I forget what it was called but, has a nice sour taste with some vermicelli noodles. Over all, good place to go to for reasonable price Thai food.",

Its such a hip cool hotel with other cool things to see so I would definitely try it.   Seafood Drunken Noodles - I really liked the squid in it along with shrimp and scallops.  I would ask for it to be more spicy as it was a little one note.  Panang curry - Red curry paste with lychees and we got it with chicken.  Very tasty. Our favorite dish.  Vegetable fried rice - tasty and solid.   We really liked it and the ambiance is really nice along with the music. Calming and tasty. Affordable. And allows you to tour the pretty Aria.",

Mee Goreng (haha) - You're nuts...and insulting for putting a $20 price tag on it.  With a couple pieces of meat.  Okay it wasn't all bad: Yellow Curry Chicken - Pretty solid and made it spicy the way I prefer it....Good job. Tom Kha Chicken - Jesus this was spiceh!  But okay...chicken texture was good. Yam poo Nim - Good starter.  Recommend to all.  We ordered other stuff but can't manage to finish this review.  I hate places that over charge based on vicinity.

The sweet and sour chicken was barely chewable sent that back. Asked for the manager. My host told her how we waited 10 minutes. She snapped back with a reply \"actually only 5 minutes\".

This place is not big at all so the seats are kind of close to each other but it was no big deal.  The best value of this this place is the soup.  For $8.00 you get a big soup that is big enough for two.  We got an order of the yellow curry and the pineapple fried rice and shared it.  Including the soup this was definitely enough for two people.  They were a little slow getting the soup out but after that the rest of the food came out in a timely manner.  Our service was great and the waiter apologized for the soup coming out slow.  I would like to come here again and try some more of their dishes in the future!",

The same with most places on the strip, it's over priced for the food. My husband and I eat a lot of Asian cuisine, and in my opinion, I've just had much better for a more reasonable price. The service was not very good either. They weren't insanely busy, but it took 30 minutes to get rice that I had ordered with my meal. I had to ask 3 times before I got it.

We all ordered the green chicken curry, spicy asian cucumbers, pad thai, and the drunken noodles. Also, just to snack on later, we grabbed some chips and salsa from Javier's (the upscale mexican restaurant at Aria). Our mouths were ON FIRE. We were using the chips and salsa (which were also spicy) to quench the fires in our mouths. We were miserable, however, the food is too good to stop eating. Err on the side of caution.

    "text": "I eat Thai food near my area quite often.  There are 3 restaurants near me within 3-4 miles radius so very competitive in quality wise.  I went with my family to LV and was looking for something that isn't a buffet for 1 meal.  Lemongrass came up as good reviews from here so thought i tried it. The atmosphere with nice, dim, dark which was ok.  the foods however wasn't good.  We ordered 4 dishes including the appetizer which was Crab Cake, very salty, by itself wasn't good to eat.  The 3 main dishes was Shrimps vegetables (again salty even with rice) Fried Tofu veg (ok by itself but with rice, would need some fish sauce or soy sauce) and 3rd dish was something i forgot but it wasn't great to stay in my memory.  The cost was bit pricey than the usual Thai restaurant but it was LV so that was expected.  The quality wasn't expected though because it wasn't good.  i wouldn't recommended this to anyone.",

Do you like your food swimming in such deep sauce that you have a hard time determining what you're eating? Do you like gobs of fatty sauce? Then you might like Lemongrass!  Pork rice. Thought it was fried rice, but it wasn't. It would have been tasty if this were steam table Chinese.  Fried rice. Loved the deep fried shitake. But the rest of it was greasy.  Steak and gloop. I'm sure that's not what it was called on the menu. This was a tiny portion of beef, utterly drowned in a peanut sauce that made my arteries harden just looking at it.   Duck and gloop. I don't think it was called this either, but again, the tiny portion of duck was drowned in so much sauce. The dish was probably as many calories as a human should eat in a week.   Sesame chicken and gloop. This was a sweet and sour type sauce with a lot of sugar and gloop.  If you like your food \"smothered\" in sauce to the point where there is nothing but gobs of fat in your mouth, you'll probably love this place.  Such a beautiful restaurant, surely deserves better food.",

Pros: not too pricey (considering it's on the strip), good variety of food, great service, little to wait time, open till 2AM, clean, nice bathrooms, and good location in Aria.  Cons: food is not the greatest as the pad thai and shrimp was greasy. Plus drinks are very overpriced.  Overall, a good place to go too if you're on a budget and craving Thai food. Just skip ordering cocktails.",

Had dinner with my husband, so we got 2 entrees and 1 app, food amount was enough to make us each pleasantly full.  Spice level is offered from 1-10 and we thought 5 for medium, but when I asked for 5/medium, the server said 2 was a medium, so we went with that.  Price is what you would expect, this being a sit down restaurant in a nice hotel on the LV Strip.    Vegetable spring rolls, fried -  These were great, pretty close to the ones from my favorite Thai take out in LA.  Green Curry, Seafood - Good flavor as well, had scallops, shrimp, squid and the usual veggies.  Delish!  Mee Goreng, Beef - Spice level of 2 was just enough, 5 definitely would have been too much.  Not a usual item I order so I can't really compare it but it's got a strong tomato flavor a was very good, although I wasn't a fan of the potatoes, being that it's a noodle dish and there's enough carb already.",

You might wander into the Aria and find yourself sitting down at a very zen-like restaurant, ordering a pad see ew and finding yourself completely dissatisfied - no spice, minimal flavor, overly inflated prices (they had pho on the menu - for a whopping $15. I've never paid more than $5 - or let's be generous and say $7 - for pho...). Regrettable.  Unlike many things in Vegas, where extravagance and decadence make things oh-so-much more fun, Thai food is probably better served in hole-in-the-wall, marketed-via-word-of-mouth locations - avoid Lemongrass. For authentic, worthwhile Thai food I'm thinking you'll have better luck off the Strip.",

The place was half full at 10pm, but it took forever for our \"very busy\" server to get our drink order. Re-fills and the food took way too long. Turns out that she was the busser.   We started with chicken satay that tasted  like something frozen from Trader Joe's. My co-worker had yellow curry and gave it average marks. I had three cups chicken. The sauce was fine, but the \"meat\" was six drumettes. You know, the \"other\" half of the wing. There was so little meat on these, mostly gristle. This was a $15 entree.   Steamed rice was $3 extra. I've had Thai food all over the country, and this is first Asian restaurant of any kind to charge for it. Soft drinks $4.50, and sky-high prices for booze or anything but sewer tap water.   The waiter didn't show up until is was time for the check. I settled up the bill with a 5% tip.   I mentioned this experience to some colleagues that have been around City Center, contractors that built the place. They mostly agree that there isn't a really worthwhile restaurant in Aria.",

This particular restaurant had an interesting interior design and was very spacious with high ceilings and ropes that suspended the lighting up in the air and cut across the restaurant. The food we ordered was a spicy soup, green curry, and a noodle dish that was chewy and flavorful. The spicy soup though was my favorite since I love spicy foods, lemongrass, and veggies. The green curry had the right amount of spice and tender chicken. The only thing I didn't like about it was the higher price but hey it's Vegas in a nice hotel/casino so what do you expect right?",

The service on my last visit was absolutely terrible. Brought it down to 3.75 stars, so I'm rounding up.  The food is beautiful, flavorful, delicious. Particularly recommend the red curry with duck breast and lychee, the crab fried rice, and the drunken noodle with seafood. Seafood central, but so delicious.  The selection of vegetarian options is scanty, and they don't really reduce the price if you want to sub veggies for the protein.  The mango and sticky rice is spot on! Temperatures were perfect, the mango was ripe and sweet.  As far as the service, things were fine at the beginning of the meal, then really started to slow down about halfway through. Then they just straight up screeched to a halt. After we finished eating, we waited over half an hour to get the waiter's attention to request our check. Then another ten minutes to actually get the check. Good thing we didn't have any pressing plans for the evening! No apology or anything. Good thing the food was so great or I'd be writing Lemongrass off my list for good.",

Being right outside the Sky Suites entrance, we must have walked past this restaurant dozens of times. However, we noticed that it was never really busy - a possible indication of quality?  We decided to try for ourselves.  We walked up to the host stand and asked for a table for two for lunch.  We were sat promptly.  This is where the promptness of service ended.  After what seemed like a longer than normal amount of time, a server came over and took our drink orders.  We ordered hot jasmine tea and water.  After another extended period of time, we received our drinks and we placed our order.  The appetizers, as well as entrees, were brought out at different times, but not as a regulated course approach, but more like bringing out as they are prepared.  This seems to reflect poor execution of timing on the kitchen's part.  For appetizers, we ordered Jellyfish, Potstickers, and Chicken Satay.  The jellyfish dish was delicious.  Crisp, fresh, with a hint of sesame, but not so much that it overpowered the dish.  The potstickers and chicken satay were unremarkable but good.  Our lunch order consisted of Phad Thai and Basil Fried Rice.  Both dishes were good, safe, prepared correctly with nothing remarkable, and not any different or better than any local strip mall Thai restaurant.  In all reality, I've had better at certain strip mall Thai restaurants.  I expected more from a restaurant within the walls of the Aria.  When compared to the likes of barMasa, it is a huge difference in the quality of service and food.",

The food was pretty good and the price is affordable!   Our server Mindy was very very good! She took care of us very well. I had my one year old daughter dine with us (5 adults). They got high chair for babies! Food was fast and hot and delicious!!!! I gotta say the service was awesome! Food was great!!!! I will definitely come back soon.",

    "text": "Arrived to Vegas on Friday evening,  was hungry and had a food voucher. Craving for asian food. Saw all the good reviews on this place. Went there to experience it. Want greeted promptly, seated in the center of the room. To me the restaurant needed a little more lighting. We got the prawn satay, seafood drunken noodles, ribeye salad. The prawn satay was really good, it came with two slices of french bread and a curry dip. The skewers of prawns was held up with a piece of pineapple. The appetizer was good.   Shortly after that the drunken noodles came out, it looked good. The flavor was bland, the seafood in it was good except for the squid, it was dry. The veggies was crunchy some of leafy parts was over done. I added in some soy and some siracha chili sauce to it.   We was also waiting on our ribeye salad, this was about 5 mins after they brought out our drunken noodles. You would think the salad would comeout first if not together with the noodles. The wife took the first bite of the ribeye. I asked her how is it, \"chewy\" she stated. I had a piece, it was chewy. It seemed like they had cut a piece of tissue with it because there was a only couple pieces that was chewy. The salad did have good flavor tho.  Now onto waiting and waiting for the server to get us our check. Seemed like forever, I also saw a customer walk up to one of the servers and said \"we need service, we've been sitting for over 10 mins and no one had came over. 5 mins passed I got my check, signed. As I was leaving that table seemed to have not been helped yet.   I give three stars as I had better thai food/experience o in a smaller town, in the US of course.",

Pineapple fried rice wasn't that tasty 2/5, needs to have more pineapple and possibly mix some veggies in. Flounder 1/5 barely any meat on the fish and too much sauce, this dish is a disaster for the price 40$...drunken noodles was good just a tad salty 4/5. 3 cup chicken barely had any flavor 1/5. Any of the Thai restaurants in Chinatown to the west of LV will give you better tasting food at a fraction of the cost of this upscale restaurant. Very disappointed.",

Protip: despite what you may assume or have experienced at other places they have a spicy scale of 1-10 ....and if you pick 10 (like i did) WATCH OUT it's like a bonfire in your mouth and you will start mysteriously sweating.

It came in a huge bowl, and even though I was hungry (I mean, really really really hungry), I couldn't finish the whole thing. It didn't come with everything that was listed as being in it on the menu, but when I mentioned it, our waitress was quick to correct the problem. She wasn't my favorite server ever -- it was a very generic and impersonal experience -- but she was nice and helpful, and although I like more, I don't feel like I can expect that.   My boyfriend got the vegetable fried rice, which was also really good. Both of us enjoyed our food so much that for the rest of the trip we kept talking about going back there instead of trying other restaurants.   The experience wasn't 100%, but the food was so good and generously portioned that it actually merited the price. We only went there once on this trip, but I'm sure we'll be back again on a future trip.",

    "text": "***There were some good dishes at Lemongrass (as well as a few items that did not feel outrageously priced); there were also a few mediocre things at Lemongrass; if you do your research though and order popular items at Lemongrass, you are probably in for a satisfying and maybe even not too pricey lunch or dinner for Las Vegas***  I saw in a taxi that Lemongrass is the only Thai restaurant located in a major resort and casino on The Strip.  Lemongrass is located in Aria and it is open for lunch (it was surprisingly busy for lunch despite its location; it is kind of located in the back of Aria, which I would assume would not get much foot traffic).  Lemongrass features an all-day menu consisting of satays, appetizers, salads, soups, entrees featuring all kinds of proteins (beef, chicken, lobster, prawns, pork, tofu, sea bass, and crab), curries, rice dishes, and noodle dishes.  Like a lot of Thai restaurants, Lemongrass features a big menu so maybe it should not be a surprise that some dishes are good while others underwhelm.  I thought their chicken wings were very good.  They were not battered, but the outside was crispy while the inside was very juicy.  The chicken wings had a good flavor too--a fair amount of spiciness.  The chicken wings were served with a sweet dipping sauce.  The Pad Thai Ghoong also had a good amount of spiciness too and the spiciness was more than I would expect with pad thai so it was a nice surprise.  The pad thai also featured good noodles, a generous portion of prawns, crushed peanuts, and bean sprouts.  I did feel that the portion of noodles was a tad small.  The fried tofu with sauteed mushrooms, peppers, onions, scallions, and oyster sauce featured really good deep-fried tofu.  The tofu had a great and distinct edge while the inside was soft and very creamy.  Unfortunately, the sauce was very lukewarm in temperature.  Even if the dish had been served fresh and hot, it might have needed more heat or flavor.  In addition, with the tofu and the cooked vegetables, the dish felt too soft (there needed to be more crispiness or crunchiness).  The yellow curry with chicken, onion and potato was quite watery and bland.  I really liked the potato, but the chicken was shredded without care and overly dry.  It was disappointing given the quality and moistness of the chicken wings.  The beef satay was not that good.  The texture of the beef was a tad chewy.  The flavor was okay though.  The satay came with garnishes of peanut sauce, cucumber relish, and ciabatta bread.  Service was good--pleasant and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.  The restaurant has a mostly dark decor.  The room is comfortable.  And despite being very close to the casino, the restaurant feels very blocked off with walls and such to keep the smoke from wafting over to Lemongrass' dining room.  Prices vary.  Appetizers are in the $10 and below range while several main dishes go for $16; there are several courses in the $25 range and portions vary with some dishes feeling generous with proteins and others feeling stingy with proteins or noodles.  Lemongrass probably has enough good things on the menu that you can have a good lunch or dinner here.  You need to do your research before coming here.  I thought the chicken wings and pad thai were both good, but the other dishes were mediocre.  I imagine there are other good things here and there are probably a few reasonably priced dishes as well.  If you know what to order and get the kitchen on a good day, Lemongrass can probably be a satisfying and not too expensive lunch or dinner on The Strip.  Like other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Aria offers free self and valet parking.",

I tried the basil fried rice and it was really very satisfying but nothing that would justify the $18 price point. Maybe I did not get the right thing.  Overall would try someplace else unless I want thai food.  Thank you",

Ive been to many other Thai restaurants and have not been a fan. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. Pricey, but you're paying for what you get. I recommend the two dishes along with pineapple fried rice if you're a pineapple fanatic.",

But all the meals are free from my poker comps so I'm here more than I would if free market forces were applied.  The Soft-shelled crab fried rice is really really good fried rice. With that said, it's fried rice and it costs something like 30 dollars. They also have a slew of dishes and you can adjust the \"hotness level\" on a scale of 1-10. I've tried level 5 and 8, and the dish that was the 5 was more spicy than some of the 8's, so I think it's spotty. If you like your stuff spicy, 8 is a good level.  I don't remember all the other dishes I tried, but they are all decent.",

    "text": "Had dinner here on 6/22 with family.  I had already read the other reviews. Some reviewers liked this place, some did not. You can put me in the column for liking it.  Started off with one of my favorite drinks, a Grey Goose dry martini, straight up. It was good, so I forced myself to drink another.  Our waiter, Van, was pretty much on top of it. Friendly, knew the menu, made suggestions based on our menu questions. I started off with the Tom Yum soup, spice level #5. Now I love spicy food but following our waiters suggestion, I stuck my level in the middle of a 1 -10 scale. Glad I did because it was just right. I could have gone up 1 or 2 more, but why? This soup was tasty. I had the shrimp version and these shrimp were very fresh and clean tasting.  We had a few different plates and shared among us. I had some type of spicy seafood noodle dish whose name escapes me right now (Grey Goose martini's?) but it is the first dish on their entree list. My wife had a green chicken curry. We switched our dishes after a short while because she thought it was a little too spicy for her. It was not too spicy for me.   Now I am somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to green curry. I make an excellent version myself. The version here at Lemongrass was better than average. My only dislike with it is that I just did not care for the pieces of potato in it, but the rest of the dish was just fine. I would order it myself.  No room for desert. It usually works out this way for me.  I would give this place somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. However, our waiter was really good and that makes a difference so I will give four stars. If you are staying at the Aria, it is a nice option for dining. Reasonably priced......................for Vegas!  Cheers to all",

I love new things, especially new things that are tasty and appear to be healthy, even if they're not. The warm coconut riceyish bowl is all that.  Lemongrass also serves the best yellow chicken curry. Ever. And no, I'm not a yellow curry expert. I order it less than 10% of the time at Thai restaurants. However, I try it off other people's plates. If I were to visit Lemongrass again, I'd order it as my own main entree.   Some other bonuses: moist, perfectly cooked chicken satay; outstanding service; outdoor lights installed inside.   I ate here during restaurant week--so I enjoyed a lovely three course dinner for $30.11. It was a damn good meal!",

    "text": "At first I was very surprised by its three star review. The I realized why as my meal progressed. Decided to come here for lunch since we wanted something inside the hotel to save time, and most other restaurants were closed for lunch. Promptly seated when we arrived, and they informed us there was still dim sum being served so we were pretty excited. The food is Chinese and Thai, even though they call themselves a Thai restaurant. So they actually pushed around some dim sum on a cart. We ordered a bunch of things and the guy pushing the cart was a pretty good salesman because we ended up with a bunch of stuff, and he spoke Cantonese as well. Most of the dim sum dishes were b/n $5-7. Definitely more expensive than most restaurants. Chicken feet - 3.5 stars, I like dim sum king better, but it was decent. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=eI9PBrgTDLA7H7pJy1mEXw%5C\">yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yu...</a> Shark fin dumpling - 3.5 stars, tasted fresh and not too bad. But I've never been a huge fan because I don't really like cilantro. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=-ry4GWNxlXF2K5xWH9Mpew\">yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yu...</a> Stick rice in lotus leaf - 4.5 stars. This was really good. Very flavorful, filled with lots of meat, and they used regular shrimp rather than dried shrimp. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=uquHg71LwLDWok7uSHRd8w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yu...</a> The next three is part of dim sum but it was not readily available on the cart. But it only took a few minutes from the point of ordering to arrival. Stuffed crab claw - 4 stars, it tasted really fresh and filled with crab and shrimp compared to most dim sum places. However as you eat the claw you can taste that it's been previously frozen. Fresher than other places, but not completely fresh. Didn't care for the mayo that came with it, just used chili sauce and soy sauce.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=3nvHw_BHvGUeHjC72yuRVQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yu...</a> Curry pork bun and basil chicken bun. I like the curry pork bun, didn't taste so much like curry but had a little kick and lots of flavor. I thought the basil chicken tasted a little bland but my bf liked it. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=eQm37SiDOa4Nhz4-RgV_IQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yu...</a> We had ordered off the regular menu and was waiting on the rest of our food. We picked the basil meatball soup, chicken curry, and after reading good reviews for the satay, I opted for the lobster satay. They bring out the food, and despite repeating lobster satay back to me, they brought a lobster salad. I informed them that it was the wrong item, so they took the salad away and one can only assume that they were suppose to bring me my satay. Basil meatball soup $9 - 4 stars. FIlled with tender soft meatballs, and loaded with lots of basil leaves. The soup was light and refreshing, and the immense taste of basil left my mouth feeling refreshed. Not too greasy, and perfectly seasoned. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=96Sz_IJDONzTffXoJBk9Ug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yu...</a> Curry - 3 stars. Tasted like everywhere else to me, the only bonus is that it was loaded with potatoes. My bf actually didn't like the curry and he only ate a little bit of it. I barely touched it so we threw most of it away. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=BfPRtLtMz5sWYqgKvOf-tA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yu...</a> So about 30-35 minutes have past since they brought me the wrong dish. We are completely done eating and still nothing. Took us about 5 more minutes to flag down out waiter, even though it was not busy at all. And he said that it's almost ready. I didn't even really want it at this point. But he just said it was coming and ran off. Waited waited waited...... 5 more minutes passes by, so I was like forget it, let's go this is stupid. It doesn't take 45 minutes to make satay. So another 5 minutes passes before we find out waiter again and ask for the bill. So guess what, they CHARGED me for the lobster satay that I DIDN\"T eat and I DIDN\"T receive. Are you kidding me????????? So his explanation was he took off the dim sum items instead. Well he took off three dim sum items that added up to $18 while my satay was $22, so WTF. It's not about $4, because even then our lunch was well over $100. I don't care about $4. I care about the principle that you did not serve me well, and you want to rip me off additionally. Why can't you just reverse the satay?? Why must you do some funky thing and take off three dim sums that adds up to less than my satay? Seriously????????? I would NEVER eat here again. I am surprised for a wonderful hotel like Aria that they would even have a restaurant like this. The service is so below par. Unfortunately I wrote a 20%+ tip before I saw the charges.  I always stayed at Aria when I went to Vegas since it opened for the last 10 times I've visited. I am really disappointed. Avoid this place, NOT WORTH IT. Such shady business practices.",

    "text": "Although this place is listed as a Thai restaurant,  it is more Asian Fusion as they have a mix of Thai and Chinese food.  I ended up ordering the Tom Kha Chicken Soup and the Yellow Curry, both them were ordered at a 8 (out of 10) for a spice level.  The Tom Kha Chicken soup was pretty large and was enough to feed 2-3 people.  The flavors were wonderful and there was plenty of chicken pieces.  The only thing that was new to me was these funny looking mushrooms that they used,  they had a purple top, but their bottoms and stems were more of a white/beige color.    The yellow curry was great as well, but there were a few pieces of potatoes that were undercooked.   The slickness of the dish was more on the mild side even tho I ordered it at a very hot level.  This dish was also large enough to share with a friend or two.  I took off a couple of stars because the service was pretty bad.  When I walked in, they didn't have any tables available and so they offered to seat me at the bar.  I grabbed one of the smaller tables beside the bar, sat down and within a few minutes I had my menu.  Then it took about another 10-15 minutes before the waiter came by to take my order.  When I was finished with my meal,  they came by took away my dishes and asked if there was anything else,  I said no and they went away.  Expecting to receive my bill, I ended up waiting another 15 mins before they came back with my bill.  So dinner at a place like this should take about 30-40 mins,  it ended up taking over an hour.  And it was not that busy in the bar area, so I couldn't understand why the lack of attention.  This place is also pretty expensive, for my 2 dishes, a Thai iced tea, and a small plate of rice(yes it was extra) my meal came out to about $33.",

I read all these awful reviews on yelp and we're going to get mediocre over-priced food -  But we thought.... well, it's walkable from where we are...  and we love Thai.. so we thought we'd give it a try.  And aren't we glad we did!  It was great!  The ambiance romantic for a nice dinner, the food fabulous, even made to order (i.e. veg with no fish sauce on request) and the staff so nice.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because we asked for the booth we saw...  the host (not manager) said no, however, we notice that when we left after our meal, the whole time we were there the booth was still left vacant.... but fair enough, the booth sat 4 or more and we were just two....  It makes sense.  But I totally support this one.  Really friendly staff who gave great and honest recommendations =)  Delicious!  And quite frankly a shocking surprise of quality on the Vegas strip!",

They not only serve typical Thai food but they also serve some typical Chinese food as well. The waiters also speak Chinese (Canto and Mando) so if you can't speak English then they can understand your orders in Chinese. I would recommend the Beef Pho, having it here is amazing and one of the best that I've ever had. The only negative I would have for this place is the price. Like all casino restaurants it can be quite expensive for usual simple dishes. But I guess the price comes with quality. And compared to some of the fancier restaurants on the strip this one cost isn't too bad.",

One thing i enjoyed is that they do have dim sum service in the mornings which was a big pleasnt suprise for me when i stayed at Aria.  Instead of waiting in line for the cafe/bakery/buffet, get some dim sum.  Avoid the pho/ noodles as they are a tad bit diluted.",

    "text": "Went here on Sunday night for late post-dinner dining after super blood moon gazing BBQ w friends.   I was looking for something Asiany w broth, and Blossom, the Chinese restaurant, seemed a little over the top and pricy given that we had already eaten dinner at the BBQ.   The decor was nice enough in the standard high end Las Vegas/ century city way, but gave a masculine, impersonal, corporate vibe, what with all the wood/ropes on the ceiling and walls and oversized lantern-looking lighting. The restaurant was dimly lit but was not romantic. It didn't even look Asian -- it could have just as easily served hamburgers and martini.   Food:  we ordered Chilean sea bass as per yelp recommendation and it was delicious. A chunk of fish filet was panko breaded and deep fried, and served drenched with thick garlicky sweet and sour sauce, with sliced green onion heaped on top. The green onion strips seemed fried as they were crunchy but was not oily. Not sure how they did that.  Hubby did not like it and thought that green onion strips just tasted hard, but I liked the light crunch. I would definitely recommend this dish.   We also ordered Mongolian beef noodle soup, which had tendon and Bok Choy. The soup was just okay, improved much by a generous dollop of hot sauce, because hot sauce makes everything better. Beef was \"dark\" meat ( don't know the name of the cut but I accidentally bought it at a Korean grocery store before so am familiar with it). This cut has a lot of blood in the meat so it is dark in color and has a subtle metallic flavor from all the iron in the meat. Tendon was weirdly slimy -- I like my tendon firm but this was more slimy fatty type which is decidedly off-putting. Noodle was fresh. I ate all the Bok choy, some beef, some noodles, and all the broth so My craving was satisfied, but would not order the same dish again.",

    "text": "If you like spice Lemongrass is for you!  I was in the Aria and had been craving Pad Thai for a week so I decided to hit up Lemongrass. First off, the space is very cool. The Aria is a 5-star hotel and Lemongrass fits right in.  I perused the menu a little bit just to see what all they offered, but I knew I was getting the Pad Thai before I even walked in the door. The waiter asked me how spicy I wanted my meal on a scale from 1-10. He explained that their food is quite spicy and 3 is medium. I like a bit of kick to my food and most restaurant's \"medium\" is usually very mild for me, so I opted for the 5. It was perfect! Spicy and hot but not so overbearingly hot that you can't actually taste the food. My bunghole was burning all night, but I wasn't using it for anything other than expelling bodily waste so that was okay. Wow, this review just took an unexpected turn.  Okay, enough about my butt. The food was great, the service was good, the space was awesome and my hotel room had unlimited amounts of toilet paper so it was a successful visit.   The portion was on the small size and should have been larger, hence my holding back the 5th star, but overall it was a great meal and both me and my burning colon will be back.",

It was late and we wanted to check out Old Vegas so we stumbled upon this place as we were exiting our hotel. It was fairly quiet, but then again it was really late. We started with prawn satay and coconut water. The appy was delicious but not enough to split amongst 2 people, we were left wanting more. We decided to order dinner instead. We had the garlic and lime steamed cod, I remember it being good but nothing memorably. The phad see ew which was kind of like a stir fry with flat noodles, is what we miss the most. I've gone to a few Thai restaurants in Vancouver but none of them do flat noodles like the ones I've had in Vegas!",

We looked on Yelp and found Lemongrass and although it took us a minute to find it in the Aria, we were so glad that we persistently endeavored to locate it.   It was literally one of... maybe the best Thai food i've ever had. There's one place here in Atlanta that might give it good competition, but i might have to hand the trophy to Lemongrass.  I ordered Phad See Yew (sp.?) with seafood and it was the most perfectly flavorful and wonderful noodle dish i've ever had.  I tried each of my friends' entrees and they were near perfection as well. Next time i visit my friend in Vegas, this is a MUST-DO restaurant.  And beyond the food, i loved the decor and the RESTROOMS WERE AWESOME!",

    "text": "Okay so I came into Lemongrass with high expectations.  It's in the Aria after all where I've really never been let down.  But yeah, tonight, tonight is either an aberrant experience or something significantly has changed.  I came into Lemongrass with the idea of having a simple, staple Thai meal -- fish cakes, basil soup, and Pad Thai.  So first of all, the wait staff and hostess were wonderful and attentive but not overly agressive.  The restraunt atmosphere is definately up to the Aria's standards.  However, I really cannot be as kind when it comes to the cuisine.  I try not to be 'that guy' who complains about the soy sauce or the salad.  Tonight, tonight is different.  We started off with the hockey pucks, I mean the fish cakes.  To describe them using the quality \"fish\" or \"cake\" would be generous.  These were dry, rubbery, almost undercooked calimari in their texture.  They completely lacked any kind of seasoning or flavor.  So I thought to myself, okay, someone is simply having a bad day.  Next course was the Thai basil soup.  This was definately soup.  It had a raft or flotilla of basil in it.  So one could say it was definately basil soup.  One could tell the broth was pork based and had some layering of that flavor but it was totally over powered by the 3 1/4 kg of basil floating on the surface.  I jest in the weight, but not in the magnitude of the basil.  Then came the final blow to this dish.  If I would say I think they used IKEA Swedish meatballs, I don't think I am far off.  Okay so now I am thinking, well maybe this was a bad decision.  The coup-de-grace of the evening was the Pad Thai.  So I checked and double checked, it had the little hot warning chili on the menu.  I had the idea in my mind that this would have the classic flavors of peanut and chili.  Boy was I wrong.  Saying that this dish had any assemblance of classic Pad Thai and I would be simply lying.  This dish had all of the texture and flavor of an under rated nursing home potato mash and over boiled spagetti noodles that have sat on the stove for a few hours.    At this time, I simply set my flatware down and went about reading the reviews.  Like I said earlier the wait staff is wonderful.  My server picked up quickly that something was amiss and was swift to remove the pallate blanching dish from the table.  He asked what was wrong with it -- more sauce, not spicy enough, not enough peanuts -- all I could say was \"yes\" and please don't try to resurrect this.  It simply needs to be composted.  To finish off the evening at Lemongrass, I went back to the appetizer menu.  Pot Stickers were my main course for the evening...  Tonight, tonight I have been completely under impressed and simply befuddled by the meal at Lemongrass.  I might come back, but honestly, when it comes to the price, value and the experience.  I'll go and find an overpriced buffet and have my expectations met.  Lemongrass, I'll be passing on you.",

Within 30 minutes, they were VERY accommodating, so this would be a great choice if you come for a convention and need a last minute group dinner reservation.   Food was not too expensive and well within the budget of many people. Especially given that Aria has many restaurants in it but are rather expensive, this was a welcome change. Great food pricing and great tasting food.   Service and staff were very accommodating and it doesn't hurt the place itself looks beautiful - so I highly recommend coming here!",

    "text": "9 year old daughter who LOVES Thai food told me to rate this \"more than 5 stars\". Food, service and ambiance second to none. Been to Vegas a few times with our kids and for some reason never made it to the Aria but from now on we'll make the Aria our place and the Lemongrass our go-to dinner spot. I ordered their ginger/peach cocktail and wife ordered pink leopard, both were superb. Daughter ordered hot green tea and asked for honey and low and behold honey showed up seconds later. Who does that anymore? Brings something right away? Very uncommon but thank you very much, impressive.  The food was 10/10, we each ordered our own separate meals, shared them and loved it all. Started with some spring rolls and chicken satay, wonderful. We didn't quite finish our food so we asked for to-go boxes. He left and another server came by to ask how we were doing, we told him, hey we just asked for boxes but we don't need them because we're going to be walking up the strip it will be hot so the food probably won't last. I'll be darn he goes right up to our server and tells him we don't need boxes. Again, Who does this kind of service and communication?   This is a wonderful and classy restaurant you don't want to miss if you're looking for Thai in Vegas.",

Lacking that certain umami in the broth  A bit pricey (but what restaurant in a Strip casino isn't?), but lovely ambience and awesome food!",

Hadn't eaten dinner yet so I met up with another friend here because we were staying at the Aria and it was one of the decent sounding places still open that wasn't on the greasy side.  Very dimly lit, the decor along the ceiling is like a weaving loom and really intriguing. Fairly quite atmosphere but can easily accommodate large groups.  Our Order Tom Kha Chicken: ($12) Chicken, coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal, abalone mushrooms Chilean Sea Bass: ($28) Deep-fried sea bass fillet, shallots, scallions, Yu-Hoi sauce Drunken Noodle with Seafood: ($20) Spicy stir-fried flat rice noodles, prawns, scallops, squid, Thai basil, Kachai, bell peppers Ginger Peach: ($14) Absolut Peach Vodka infused w/ Black Tea, Canton Ginger Liqueur, and Fresh Sour served tall over ice Watermelon Caipiroska: ($14) Grey Goose Vodka, Fresh Limes and Fresh Watermelon juice  The Tom Kha surprisingly had a strong mushroom flavor that overpowered the coconut. So instead of a more tart flavored soup, it was fairly earthy tasting which was interesting but we didn't love it. I love mushrooms too =/  I ordered the Drunken Noodle w/ Seafood due to the reviews I saw on it. Honestly, it was greasy and tasted like chow mein. Nothing special and wouldn't order again.  Why I would come to Lemongrass? The Chilean Sea Bass. It was cooked perfectly: wasn't dry and very soft.  They drinks were good and very strong. They had better be at $14/drink! Even though they came out in small glasses, they pack a punch. My friend's a light-weight and drank a little more than half the cup and got tipsy. I nearly finished both drinks but my friend was too far out that we had to go back to the room.  Wouldn't go out of my way to come here since there are so many places to eat in Vegas but if I was in the same predicament, I certain wouldn't mind.",

    "text": "FYI, I think this is the first Thai restaurant I've seen in a Vegas resort, which is good. Variety is always good.   We ordered the rib eye steak, duck red curry, and two other dishes I barely remember.  The duck curry was hands down the best.  It was really tasty, if a tad sweet.  The crappy part about the dish was that there was barely any duck in it.  What duck it did have was tender and well-cooked.    I only ate a piece of the steak - it was ok.  The other two dishes I don't remember were average. We also had spring rolls with cream cheese inside - strange, but not bad.    Overall, the food was fine.  It's friggin pricey for Thai food ($30+ per person after tax and tip), but that's probably the cheapest place to eat at in Aria, next to the crap-tacular cafe they have. And maybe the buffet which judging from reviews, is pretty crap-tastic itself.  Service here, unlike the rest of Aria, was actually okay.  I only had to ask for the check twice.  The food, water, etc. and everything all came out okay.   If I was fiending for Thai food and I was in or near Aria, I'd come by.  It's not really worth a detour.",

The decor of the restaurant is nice, dark woodwork plus neutrals makes for a cool vibe. The seating was very comfortable --  we were in the sofa booth facing the entrance of the restaurant.  Food ordered: lobster tom kha soup, green curry, vegetable fried rice, and cashew chicken.   Tom kha soup was really good, perfect spice. We asked for a 7, and got a good runny-nose spicy that we were craving! Only gripe: the soup was big enough for two, but only had 3 small pieces of lobster meat. The green curry was also good. But, wasn't out-of-this-world amazing. It hit the spot. The vegetable fried rice was not as great. It was on the bland side, and a tad oily. The cashew nut chicken had great flavors, lots of cashews.   I loved how they knew their spice! The dishes weren't bland, and they were spicy enough for us to enjoy, without burning our tongues off! Service was very attentive -- although at times it got overwhelmingly attentive!   Overall, a bit pricey for the food served, but it's to be expected at a strip restaurant. Good service, and good food. Would def visit again.",

    "text": "First thing you think of when you go into the Aria Hotel is bling bling, I must be getting paper fo'sho if i'm staying here. That ubiquitous air of wealth and luxury permeates the atmosphere, you can't help but feel like Justin Bieber in Vegas. You're the bomb; anything is possible in sin city. With this new found confidence and flare for extravagance, what sort of dining experience do you expect? I'm thinking exotic. I'm thinking fantabulous. I'm thinking thai food.  So, during my short stay at the Aria hotel in Las Vagas, me and my family decided to go to Lemongrass. First of all, the decor was amazing. Curtains of fringe hung effortlessly on the ceiling, creating a tent over some of the tables. The lights were dim, creating a very sensual atmosphere, mimicking that oriental mysteriousness of Asia. Om nom nom nom, this place looks amazing!  I wish i could say the same about the food. It was like turning on the T.V, being all excited to watch the new episode of the Real Housewives of New York, but getting disappointed when instead, you see the rerun of a cheap, tacky real housewife of New Jersey flipping a table. Don't tase me bro! I love the Manzos and all, but the Simon and Alex are where it's at! Anyway, back to the food, I could have gotten tastier, more authentic thai food at half the price right here in OC. Don't get me wrong though, the food wasn't horrible, it was very much delicious.  For appetizers, we ordered the Yam Ta Krai (lemongrass, fresh prawns, squid, scallops, spicy tamarind dressing) and Tom Yam Talay soup (spicy seafood, prawns, scallop, squid, lemongrass, abalone mushrooms).The appetizers were amazing! The seafood was super fresh, and everything was really tasty and flavorful.  What I was really disappointed in were the entrees. I hate curry...NOT. I'm bananas for curry. Everytime I eat thai food, which is very often, I order curry again and again and again. I would bathe in curry and immerse myself in its deliciousness if I could. Curry is better than shark week; it is legend...wait for it...dary. So, i ordered the green curry since it came with eggplant ( eggplant is a sign God wants us to be happy). I didn't hate it, I could never hate curry. It would be like a mother hating her child. It was just watered down and lacked that unctuous and satisfying spice that curry is supposed to have. My mom ordered the Drunken Noodles, which I guess is one of their specialties. To be honest, these noodles tasted like a typical msg-ridden fried noodle dish from a mediocre Vietnamese restaurant. The crisp on the noodles was nice; but like the curry, it lacked flavor.   The dessert was amazing though! But then again, I've never complained about the dessert at any restaurant. Dessert is like Ryan Gosling; it's good all the time. I ordered mango sticky rice, a thai classic! If you've never had mango sticky rice, you have never lived. The red ruby was very tasty as well. It was shaved ice with corn, jellies, and jack fruit. The corn was a sweet, surprising touch.   Overall the restaurant was average. I would give ten stars for the decor but only three stars for the actual food. Compared to the prices of other shnazzy Vegas restaurants, this place was a pretty good deal. But compared to a more humble, authentic thai restaurant, the food seemed bland. If you want super yummy, exotic drinks, appetizers, and deserts with a cool and stylish ambiance, definitely try this place!",

    "text": "Lemongrass was very good.  Classier and more than twice the price of what we'd get for something similar in LA, but the cuts of meat are nicer, the waitstaff is very pro and attentive, and the ingredients are top notch.  However, the tom kha was EXTREMELY spicy.  Like, Thai spicy.  As in, we asked for medium (I've been to thailand twice and can handle some VERY spicy food) and we were served something we could barely eat.  It was vert tasty, so I downed it, but had to pay with a tummy ache later.  That said, most Thai places take the really spicy Thai peppers, split them with the side of a knife, and put them in for flavor.  Lemongrass seemed to have ground up the peppers iN the soup, which is kind of a no-no, as it was just WAY too hot, and killed the flavor, so we had runny noses and fire-burned tastebuds.  The Shanghai rice noodles, although not Thai, were delicious, and perfect, and beautiful form the tri-colored bell peppers.  VERY nice, good food (save the crazy spiciness of the soup), and kind of what you'd expect from an upscale casino restaurant.  Not cheap, but good, and it was the only place open for lunch at 3 o'clock.",

I've had better at much less fancier places.    We ordered chicken pad thai, chicken soup with coconut milk, and chicken curry.  All tasted pretty bland to me, none of the flavors really stimulated my taste buds.    But, if you have no way of leaving the strip and you're really craving thai food, then I guess this would be the place.  I will say that the service was friendly and attentative.  I can't really comment on the price because my friends were nice enough to treat me to dinner.",

    "text": "I agree with the person who would rate this restaurant 3.5.  The food is comparable to many Thai restaurants in Northern California but nearly twice the price for everything.  I tried the seafood chow fun which is Chinese, not Thai, and it was very tasty although a bit on the oily side. There were scallops, calamari and shrimp which were huge, but had a very funny aftertaste like they had been soaked in something.  That aftertaste turned me off so much I had to stop eating them.  The yellow curry with chicken, potatoes, onions and peppers had a nice kick.  We asked for medium heat and It was actually making us sweat. Nice that they didn't dumb it down for the Caucasians.  The pineapple rice was nice too, with huge shrimp.  There were a lot of raisins or maybe currents in nearly every bite which I didn't expect.  The pineapple tasted fresh and the dish was very good with bits of BBQ pork added in for flavor.  Rice was not included so an additional bowl of Jasmine rice for the curry was $3 - 4, which makes me upset..  Any curry that costs nearly $20 or more should include rice.  Shame on them.  The Thai Iced Tea was really good and freshly brewed (as opposed to package mix).  Not a bad meal despite the nickel and dime pricing and the odd non-Thai dishes all over their menu.  The service was very nice and the restaurant was a very creative design of thread, rope and other material that play with the light.  It was dark but sophisticated and I liked the way it was laid out.  If you're in the mood for Thai, or Asian in general, this isn't a bad option but perhaps not my favorite Asian food on the strip.",

Huge bonuses for vegas with baby and group of friends.  If you are here on the weekends they have dimsum. And some of the best dimsum dishes I have had in the United States. Everything was fresh and tasty. Not overly salty and not overly oily. We got the ribs and chicken feet. We also got the stick rice wrapped in banana leave with chicken. Really very authentic.  On the side I order abalone congee and a spicy beef noodle soup. The congee was perfectly cooked. There were lots of abalone in the congee. Usually other restaurants really skimp on that and give just a couple slices. The beef noodle soup was not as great. The beef tendon was really hard and the broth was kinda on the sour side.  We basically had a wonderful dinning experience and for the rest of our four day trip we kept coming for lunch and late night snack. Open till 2 am!!",

It's not the best, and it is definitely more Americanized, but it is great, nonetheless.  The restaurant is beautiful, tucked away in the back of the casino level of Aria, next to a few other restaurants.  It wasn't too crowded and we had great service.  My husband always gets Pad Thai, this one was good, but kind of small, which is really bizarre because my yellow curry was huge, big enough for two for sure.  He liked his Pad Thai, but it wasn't amazing, the yellow curry, on the other hand, was some of the best I've ever had.  I took half of it back to the hotel with me and it made a great midnight snack!  The Thai tea is overpriced, but it usually is at any thai restaurant in a big city.  But it's good, of course, you can't really mess up Thai tea.",

For appetizers: We had satay grill sticks that were accompanied with a peanut sauce, cucumber relish, and ciabatta bread. We had chicken, lobster, and beef. We also had fish cakes that were delicious.  We shared a coconut soup that I didn't really care for, but that's probably biased of me since I prefer tom yum soup over coconut based soups.  For the main course, we had fried rice and pad thai. I'm not sure exactly which ones we had, but they were good.  I like this place because it's mostly Thai food with other Asian influences. Definitely something I would come back to.  The service was great and we all left happy and full :)",

Alone, I wouldn't consider this terrible, but then the food arrived. Mine was not edible as the chicken in the dish was so salty I could not eat it. My husband had Pad Thai, but there were almost no noodles in it. I've had better Pad Thai at home, let alone pay this much for it. When I made our reservation, I was assured my husband's birthday would be acknowledged at dessert, but when it was time.....nothing!

The basil beef was made too spicy for me as there was a misunderstanding on how spicy I wanted it.  However, when I informed the server, he handled the mistake with class and immediately got me another freshly made dish and apologized.  It's okay for restaurants to make mistakes and how I really judge them is on how they react to the problem.  THe problem with my dish was handled extremely well and I commend them for their great service to ensure I was happy.    Our bill came to less than $100 for two of us and we were stuffed!  Pretty good for some really good food in a swanky hotel.  Highly recommend!! We will be back on our next trip to Vegas",

    "text": "The dining experience on the Vegas strip is without limits unless you're in the mood for some very good Asian food.  Until recently, I was under the impression that you had to drive off the Strip to find any decent Asian restaurants, but The Lemongrass kind of changed that.  Although it's not the best Asian food you're going to have, it will be a dining experience that will leave you more impressed and satisfied than not.  There were 2 forces that led me to the Lemongrass at the Aria: 1) I was staying at the Aria resort and 2) my wife was craving Asian food.  I was feeling particularly lazy and didn't want to drive off the Strip, so we decided to give Lemongrass a shot.  Unlike most of the dining options at the Aria resort, the Lemongrass won't cost you an arm and a leg, but expect to pay a premium over your typical Thai spot.  The restaurant is decorated in that simple modern look that is consistent with the Aria resort with subtle (or not so subtle) Asian cues.  The servers were friendly and quick to fill water glasses or bring extra napkins, but weren't able to really offer suggestions from the menu (possibly a language issue).  The service isn't over-the-top excellent but it's far better than what you get at most Asian restaurants.    For our late night snack, we ordered fried rice and the prawn spring rolls.  The fried rice was good - nice chunks of meat.  The real winner was the prawn spring rolls.  Their interpretation of the dish was impressive and tasty, and it kind of made me wish that we were hungrier so that we could try another dish.  Yes, the prawn spring rolls were pretty good - light and crispy, not oily, and loaded with flavor.    If you need a comparison: the Red 8 at the Wynn doesn't even compare in terms of food taste and service, despite the Wynn being a much better resort than Aria.  I paid $40 for fried rice and prawn spring rolls after tax and tip - much more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant but not bad for something on The Strip.  Considering the dining options at the Aria, the Lemongrass is actually a decent place to eat - not too artificially upscale or pretentious.",

So they say....You're in Vegas $$$! So if you have a budget.. skip this restaurant and spend at the casino. The prices here are ridiculous for mediocre Thai food, it's almost really funny! We were all craving Asian food and didn't want to go far from our hotel and this restaurant came up in our Yelp search and of course P.F. Chang's :/ sad to say.. we should of went to P.F. Chang's...  Nice Huge romantic restaurant inside the Aria Hotel and casino. We were celebrating a bachelorette that night and bought a bottle of moscato ($45) that was soooo good!! sad to say.. that was the only good thing about this restaurant. The food was disappointing.   1. Beef Pho $18- 2/5 don't be surprised that it didn't taste authentic.. you are at a Thai restaurant tien :( oh why did you have to order this, you Pho addict!!!  2. Shrimp pad thai 3/5  3. drunken chicken noodles. 2/5 4. shrimp fried rice. 2/5 5. Duck Curry 2/5 6. $45 bottle of moscato- 5/5 delicious!! one of the best tasting moscatosssss ever!!! Hahah  Service was good, funny dude! However, I wished he would have checked up on us a little more mainly for water!!",

Came with potatoes and onions in it.   Overall had the sense that while the flavors were almost there, they were missing a sort of dynamism that left them a little bland.",

    "text": "I went here tonight with my friend and was totally expecting fabulous food. We were both beyond disappointed and will not come back to this location again. Way over priced for the quality of food with lack of any flavor.  1. Pot Stickers $10 Pan-fried pork dumplings, vegetables, chili-vinegar soy sauce  We ordered the pot stickers and that was the only part of the meal that was good. But then again potstickers are hard to mess up.  2. Then we ordered Pla Lobster** $24 Spicy grilled lobster, fresh herbs, lemongrass, Chinese celery  This consisted of rubbery overcooked Langostinos which are not Lobsters. They were very small, tasteless and chewy. No heat whatsoever or flavor in this salad and it consisted of 98% celery. It should not be called a salad. Nothing salad about it. Someone should explain Salad to these people.   3. Then we ate the: Garlic and Lime Steamed Cod** $26 Steamed codfish, chili, mint, garlic, lime sauce  So we SAW Garlic on the plate and SAW sliced limes on top of the fish but in no way was this flavor in, around or in any way infused into the fish. My friend could not eat her piece and left it on her plate. I ate mine but had to put chili paste on top to give it flavor. It was even missing salt. In fact the salad and the main entree did not have adequate seasoning, flavor or at the very least salt.  I ordered a Spiced Rum drink with literally NO RUM in it. for $15.00 I would expect some rum in the drink but all I tasted was thai tea and coconut milk.  So $90 later we left hungry and pissed.  I think the only reason this place gets any business is due to their location because their food is horrid and their drinks are light.  Their slogan at the top of the page: \"The only authentic Thai restaurant on The Strip\" makes me cringe. As a local they have some serious nerve to claim such nonsense. They seriously must appeal to people without tastebuds. If you're a True foodie, run like hell.  A nearby slot machine must have felt bad for me because I won enough in 5 min to pay for my bad dinner. lol",

But if you do like authentic Thai curries that are rich, spicy, flavorful and also kinda light for a curry, this place is amazing. Also crab dishes excellent and we tried the Tamarind steak--very tender and sauce was excellent (bye, not spicy). Dim sum menu is more limited (we were not there for weekend brunch, but rather late on a Fri night so maybe more during the day?) than advertised, but two we did try were excellent--fillings were flavorful and wrappers light and not chewy. Cod looking great, as did other seafood. Service is slightly better than usual casino large restaurants. Certainly friendly and helpful--especially at midnight! And love love the fact this place was open until 2 am. Perfect place after seeing a great concert next door at T Mobile Arena. Just follow the Aria signs to the Sky Suite checkin and you'll find it off the casino floor down a bright hallway. I love Thai food generally and was really surprised at the authenticity and quality.

We ordered garlic wings, wonton noodle soup and hot & sour soup, all hangover cure food of course! The hot and sour soup had no shredded pork in it, just generous amount of veggies in very sour and fairly spicy hot soup, that was all I needed at the moment!

Dined here with my boyfriend and we both love Thai food and have a hard time finding it at quality and anywhere in the States frankly. This place though. Wow. We decided to get dumplings the most recent time and absolutely enjoyed them! They came out quickly, hot, and every bite was better than the last! The server was so happy to help us with any questions and made sure to put the order in quickly so we could eat fast as well.  If you have time, I would highly recommend trying this place and getting their sampler of dumplings. Great variety and makes you wanting more and enjoying every bite. Staff also makes you happy you chose this place!",

Make sure you make reservations first because its very popular during evening hrs. Decor is exquisite and elegant with amber lighting, causal attire I would say required.  Very welcoming staff, especially the girls at the podium waiting to seat you. I have only great things to say about my dining experience.  It was ample and I will defiantly return.",

I typically try the massaman curry whenever I find it, and Lemongrass has it. It was good, was disappointed I had to ask for white rice and pay for it. My partner has the pad see ew and unfortunately it needed more sauce. We found it to had the right flavor, just dry. The Tom Kah soup had way to much mushrooms and lacked spice. Love the vast selection just didnt follow all the way on the execution.",

I usually don't post low reviews, but the unnecessary high prices for unauthentic lack lusting flavor, tiny beverages, & extra charge for rice when ordering curry compelled me to.   The decor and setting sets an expectation for delicious authentic Thai food. Yet you don't get that here. Heck it doesn't even need to be authentic, just good. And again, you don't get that here. I will say the ingredients are good quality, expect good quality meat & vegetables, but everything lacked flavor & authenticity. It tasted like an Italian chef was trying to make me authentic Thai food.  I understand it's Vegas and high prices are everywhere, but usually the food is decent enough to make a compromise. I've been to some bad mediocre Thai restaurants and this place is one of the worst. It's not disgusting, it's just bland. Thai food is known for its intense flavor, so bland isn't good at all! Especially not authentic. They could have been having a bad day, but it's not just that. The dishes just didn't taste authentic. Every dish tasted like it was missing an ingredient or two.   Lastly I'm not happy with paying extra for rice when ordering curry. Rice always comes with curry. Who doesn't eat rice with curry? And the drinks were tiny. $16 for like 1/2 cup of alcohol? That's outrageous! Wayyyy over priced, food quality is lackluster and not authentic. I kinda hope they close down. Feels like a robbery and I now understand why they have a 3.5 rating.   P.s. we came here even with the 3.5 rating bc I think we mistook it for the other lemongrass Thai restaurant. Big mistake!",

It was a few hours before dinner on a Saturday night and prior to calling to book a reservation, I was afraid they wouldn't be able to take our large group in with a few hours notice. But the lady I had spoken to on the phone was very accommodating and was very helpful through the booking process.  Considering that the location of the restaurant was inside Aria, I was already certain that it would have a nice, lavish atmosphere, and it did! The interior and exterior decoration was beautiful. I really enjoyed the different arts and decor.  The menu was definitely interesting. There were a combination of Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese dishes. I ordered a Pad Thai with chicken and a Red Curry with beef. Although the portions were good, the Pad Thai unfortunately lacked flavor. It was really bland and needed either more salt or fish sauce. The Red Curry was a bit bland as well and needed more seasoning. I heard the Panang Curry with rib-eye steak was good though.  The service we received was nice. The staff was approachable and very attentive.  The pricing was affordable for a modern Thai restaurant in Vegas, let alone in Aria. My dishes were $18, $19. The portions were good for their price, but they lacked flavor.",

We decided to try the tasting menu. We also added the wine pairing. The food was awesome! Hubby got a 5 and I got a 10. Kathleen was very concerned initially, but i loved it! The soup was spicy, but excellent! Hubby had the curry and it was some of the best we've ever had. Flavor was amazing! Chicken was so tender! I had the pad Thai. Easily the best pad Thai I have ever had!!!! I was a little disappointed in the heat. Maybe it was just because the soup had been intensified by the physical heat, but the pad Thai did not seem nearly as hot. The flavor was exceptional though!!! The wine pairing was one of the beat pairings we've ever had. So often a pairing really does not add much to the meal experience, but this did. Also, we we're celebrating hubby's bday and they brought out some house made coconut ice cream. He loved it. This was a great experience!!!! He's been obsessed . I'm certain he would have eaten every meal here if I'd let him!!!!",

It is a bit expensive but that's on par with most other places in Vegas and of course, it's near a casino, so you can gamble while you wait for your table. I ordered the seafood curry and it was phenomenal. They will allow you to choose the level of spice you want, which I appreciated. It had excellent flavor and a good amount of potatoes and fish. Will definitely go back!",

I ordered the red curry with duck.  When askes about the spice level, she said 1 - 10.  I told her 7.  She asked if I was sure and told me the average spiciness level was 3.  I told her 7.  She looked at me but wrote the 7 down.  I ordered brown rice--rice whether white or brown is an extra charge.  After a normal amount of wait, our entrees arrived.  My red curry was good and the spice was almost perfect.  An 8 perhaps would have been better.  The sauce was good and there was a good amount of duck.  For dessert, which turned out to be the best part of the meal, I got coconut ice cream served on a bed of warm sticky rice with ribbons of mango and pieces of jackfruit.  This is the second time I left Lemongrass thinking the dessert was the best reason for coming.  There are so many great Thai restaurants in the area that it's not worth the hassle to go to the Strip and park.  Were it not for the fact my friends were staying at Aria, I wound't have picked Lemongrass.",

I wasn't able to get a reservation and when we walked up to see if there were any tables available, we were told that there weren't (even though there were several table that were empty). Perhaps there wasn't enough staff for the night.  We decided to hit up the bar area since it was first come first serve. We were lucky enough to snag 2 seats, and we were provided with menus and drink options.  I ordered a club soda, Thom Kha soup, and the Pad See Ew noodles. The soup only came in a large (no bowl) so you get this humungous serving. The chicken and veggie pieces are cut large, which is kinda of a turn off for me. I like more bite sized foods. The soup was decent and I added a little spice for a kick.  My Pad See Ew noodles definitely needed more sauce and heat. It was a little bland for my liking and I did add chili flakes to make it flavorful. I think I still needed more oyster sauce to add a bit more flavor to my noodles.  A bit on the pricey side, but you're in Vegas so expect to pay a bit more in the hotel restaurants.",

I eat here quite often so know exactly what to order immediately.  We were starving!   Kris took my order.. Potstickers, Chicken Tom Kah Soup, Shrimp Pineapple Fried Rice & Shrimp Pad Thai all to come out slowly like a tasting menu.  All of which are a must & my favs!  Entrees, Yellow Chicken Curry w/ Brown Rice & Ribeye w/ Tamarind Sauce & Sticky Rice.  Shared each course w/ my family as it came out.    Lots of food for $135, which includes tip & no drinks since we had full drinks from the casino & still took home a small doggy bag beautifully packed.  Enjoy",

I am not impressed overall - especially for Vegas (where you have many options)  Appetizer: Fish Cakes - too greasy The spicy curried fish patties were flavorful but too greasy for me; the sweet chili sauce was ok  Drinks: Iced Tea (regular unsweetened was black and tasted good) the hot green tea was flavorful and good too  Som Tam Spicy green papaya salad, fish sauce, dried shrimp  (I asked for the fish sauce on the side and I am glad I did ... it was not the best tasting sauce. Also there was no dried shrimp on my salad!!) Pass on this for $10.  Entree: Sea Bass too saucy for me (deep fried - breaded and drenched in sauce). It tasted like orange chicken but a flaky version since the sea bass melts in your mouth.    I ordered the papaya salad as my side instead of rice ($3 for steamed $4 for brown) with it. I was not impressed. Random note - there was a huge piece of cabbage that no one at the table knew what to do with in my salad!  Yellow Curry Chicken:  Good flavor with the onions, the coconut milk sauce was not too thick or heavy, the chicken was slightly chewy but overall the dish was flavorful. Spice level 5!  Phad Thai \"J\" - with chicken added to the tofu, bean sprouts, chinese chives was ok/basic/plain, the chicken was chewy, the tofu was not bad.  Prices are reasonable - quality is sub par for Vegas. It is edible and quick. I recommend trying somewhere else first : - )",

We ordered appetizers last night and we were so impressed that we came again today for main courses.  1. Chicken wings were crispy and perfectly cooked 2. Potstickers were meaty and robust 3. Fried tofu was fluffy inside and crispy on the outside  4. Tom yam was ordered with veggies and was hearty and the added eggplant was amazing 5. Som tam was perfectly crisp and mixed with the perfect amount of spicy sour bite 6. Seafood green curry had large scallops, squid and shrimp  7. Veggie fried rice and hearty and plentiful  8. Rad naw had large pieces of tender pork and the sauce was velvety   NOTE: these portions are family size, so although you see the price point at $16-19 on a plate, it's enough for a 5-6 people to eat. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "The best bang for your buck Thai/Asian fusion on the strip!  I love food. Vegas, despite being a culinary hot spot, can be hard to find something right for me. I'm not a buffet person. Fast casual is great, but not for every meal. And the same goes for high end dining- I'll do it for something special, but it'll break the bank if I go every night. Lemongrass hits that rare sweet spot of being somewhere in the middle. It's a sit down restaurant with a nice ambience, provides tasty food in decent portions, all while being reasonably priced.  Speaking of tasty food, Lemongrass carries one of my favorite dishes ever-- the Mee Goreng. Consisting of wok-fried yellow noodle, fried tofu, egg, potatoe, chili, tomato, choy sum and chicken (or your choice of beef or shrimp), it hits all the right notes. The sauce is slightly tangy and sweet while the egg, potato and chicken add a savory flavor. It's served in a hearty portion with the ability to choose your level of spice. When I visit a Thai restaurant for the first time, I always wonder if they are going to white-wash the spice level. This is not the case here with a level 6 nearly burning my palate off (just how I like it!). Last time I visited the waitress even said I'm more Asian than her! If mee goreng isn't your thing (it should be), Lemongrass also offers a variety of other dishes such as rice, curry and even lobster or steak. They have good appetizers too-- I'm a huge fan of the spring rolls (they're fried so don't come here right before the pool) and one of my friends swears by the jellyfish.  Usually there isn't too bad of a wait and you can make reservations in advance. The staff have always been prompt and friendly. I can't say enough good things about this place. It's always a must when I come to Vegas!",

It is beautifully fit for the very modern Aria.  Our service was a bit weird. I understand it's difficult to accommodate large parties, but our service just seemed a bit whacky. A little \"all-over-the-place.\" In a rather empty restaurant, they told us it would take them 20 minutes to set up a table for 10. All I could think of was, why?  Anyway, the food. The food was good and decently priced (especially for Vegas). Our pho was about $12 a bowl? Double what I pay out here in Oakland, but like I said... it's Vegas and it beats paying $70 for a small steak. My friend ordered the soft shell crab (I think) fried rice and it was DELICIOUS. Everyone at the table loved it. They also served dim sum, which was a nice surprise and comparable to Oakland dim sum. I NEVER said it was AS GOOD as Oakland's dim sum... but it exceeded our expectations.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to those looking for an inexpensive bite and if they're at the Aria for any reason.  OH! Avoid the pho though. It was extremely bland...",

BF & I have eaten here several times (mostly when we've stayed, because you don't really want to walk down the strip full) and he always seems to enjoy it more.  I'd personally give this a 3.5, he'd probably rank this a 4.25.  There's just nothing that special about it.  Everything looks really nice.  Everything seems fresh and well prepared.  But off the top of my head, there's nothing that screams, holy cow I have to get you again.  Save for (and this would be my 0.5 increase), the strawberry gelato.  There is nothing like it.  And nothing else in the line really matches its par.  Oh well, that and the spicy pepperoni pizza (I know, of all the things).  They make their own na'an, which is good, but is kind of useless because the dishes they offer for you to eat it with are well, 'blah.'  Service is always great, and pricing isn't too bad.  Actually, you can't really complain about price when stuff is comp'd.  Line is never too long either.  It's not that I don't recommend eating here, it really is just more of, I wish they had a better tasting selection.",

    "text": "I recently discovered this gem of a Thai restaurant with a group of friends.  I have been coming to vegas frequently over the years and have tried most of the top restaurants in las vegas.  What I have come to discover is that most of the restaurants in the newer hotels, especially the ones that serve asian fare, are decent, but incredibly over priced.  That was not the case with Lemongrass.  I found them to have a wide range of food that was absolutely delicious.  The decor and ambiance were impressive and the service was excellent.  A great way to enjoy a delicious and fun meal with a group of friends.  Would recommend it to anybody.",

She informed us that her shift was ending, so we got stuck with Alex, and over the next five times someone came to the table, we had a different person each time.  My drink ran out three times.  No freakin' way. One time is barely tolerable. But three times?   The place was not overwhelmingly busy. There were at least nine tables around me that were empty, and only four of them occupied. Not sure what the problem was.  The food was *decent*... the fried rice seemed to have a bit too much oil. My friend's Mongolian Beef was overwhelmed with onions... it seemed as if there were more onions than meat.  Overall, the ambiance (Edison-style lights are awesome) was unbelievably gorgeous... but that's about where the Pros list ends and the Cons start.   Better luck next time... but there are so many places in LV/on the Strip that this won't be worth a return visit anytime soon.",

The menu also includes Chinese and Indonesian dishes and even Dim Sum anytime.  We eat Asian food all the time. You can order hotness on a 1-10 scale. When we said 5, the waiter said that that's too hot. We ordered 3's and 2's and they were plenty hot. And we like hot.   We ate there twice during our 10 stay in LV.   It's in the Aria Hotel, which I consider a must-see for any trip to LV, for anyone who enjoys modern art.   Somewhat more expensive than most Thai restaurants, but, hey, this is the Strip, plus it's the Aria Hotel. The expensive is worth it.",

Food: 7 - The curry had these awesome mini-asian eggplants (they look like tomatillos) and tons of creamy, yet spicy (I ordered it as a 7) flavor.    Service: 8 - Ate at the bar, the bartendress was very attentive and friendly.  Location: 4 - It's a pain in the ass to get here from even 1 hotel over.  I recommend eating here if you're staying at Aria, otherwise that walk home is a terrible terrible thing.     Other: The bar was STOCKED - I imagine you can get any drink made you could ever want.  It's expensive though, a bottle of Fiji water is $9, and the Tsingtao is $12.",

    "text": "Yikes. I should have paid more attention to the Yelp reviews on this place, but there aren't many sit-down lunch options at Aria and we were on a pre-meeting time crunch. The other nearby option was the French pastry place with the pre-made sandwiches laid out in a display case... But we're fans of Thai food and figured: \"how bad can it be?\"   Well, apparently it can be much worse than we thought. We started with the vegetarian spring rolls and the prawns (which our waiter assured us was \"the best appetizer on the menu\"). The spring rolls could have come from any cheap hole-in-the-wall Chinese place I've ever been to. I wish they had been better because they ended up being the only thing I ate for lunch. I'm told the prawns were okay, but if they were \"the best appetizer,\" my dining companion commented that the other options must be pretty scary.  For entrees we decided to try the pad Thai, chicken satay and some vegetable fried rice. I kid you not - the pad Thai tasted like dish water. The fried rice had no sauce, and was basically white rice with little squares of carrot and onion in it. The satay came with peanut sauce, and while I had never before met a peanut sauce I didn't like, this one was awful. It was bland, noticeably lacking in sweetness (which would have enhanced the otherwise-absent flavor), and quite honestly just not worth the calories.    We had no complaints about the service or ambiance, but in a city filled with so many great restaurants this one definitely belongs at the bottom of the dining list.",

This is not a thai restaurant, but a restaurant with south east asian cuisine.  You will be dissapointed if you think you are going to get good thai food here.  Thought they had the dim sum cart, but that is only offered on the weekends - Fri, Sat, Sun.    We had the bacon satay.  The server said it was fatty and no kidding, it was.  It was not like the bacon you have at breakfast, but a fatty piece of pork.  You get 4 skewers.  I could barely take 1 down.     We had the Drunken Noodle with Seafood, the Softshell Crab fried rice and the grilled pork neck.  The best dish was the drunken noodle.  It had a nice basil flavor to the noodle.  I could not find the seafood, except for 2 shrimp and 1 scallop.    The soft shell crab fried rice was okay at best.  Lots of crab, but it seemed that they did not clean the body of the crab well, as it tasted really gutty and had a strong fish smell.  The fried rice was like any other asian fried rice.  Nothing special.   The grilled pork neck was the best dish.  The sauce was exceptional.  It did not sound like a great dish, but it was.  Very lean pork with a soy, mandarin, lime sauce.  Very tasty.    Service was okay.  Jeremy was a decent server.  The busboys were able to keep up with the iced tea and water service.  We drink fast and a lot, so anyone who can keep up with us, is fantastic.",

I loved it and unfortunately, coming back to the East Coast, I haven't found better (although I've been told to go to my hometown neighborhood of South Philly on Washington Ave).  My boyfriend ordered some sort of Curry Chicken dish and the Tom Kha Ga soup.  He loved every last bit of both.  This will be the first restaurant we go to on our next trip out to Vegas.  P.S. 4 out of 5 stars only because after our waiter brought us our food, we didn't see him again until we were ready for the check.

The decor is very nice and reminiscent of more expensive restaurants.  Some well dressed people were enjoying there meals around us.  The menu is not strictly Thai, but more of a mix of various Asian food options with Thai food as the primary focus.  I actually went non-Thai.  My Szechaun beef noodle soup was good, but not as spicy as I thought it should be.  Comments from the table were that some of the meals hit the spot, but the soup was not bold and tangy like we were used to having at Thai places in the Bay.  So, reasonably priced ... not perfect food, but quite good and more of a fusion or Pan-Asian option.  If you are dying for authentic Thai, this place might be lacking in some of the bolder flavors I associate with the genre.  But I was happy with it overall and the service was good.

The food:  Chicken Satay: Holy crap those are good. Combined with rice and you've got yourself a yummy grilled meal. If I remember correctly, there were 4 skewers, but they were large skewers so you could have it all to yourself as a meal or share with others as an app. The chicken were tender and wasn't burned, but grilled to perfection. The sauce was good and there was bread, but I didn't care much for that.   Crispy marinated squid: Hated it. Squid was coated with too much flour and there was absolutely no flavor. Very bland, wouldn't call it marinated at all, and hardly crispy at all.  Yellow Chicken curry: Very meh. There wasn't a lot of chicken and the curry was a bit thicker than I expected for a Thai curry. I'm fairly sure there was more potato than chicken.  Thai iced tea: It was ok, but expensive ($4.50!?)  Service:  It was ok for the most part. Waiter came quickly enough and our food arrived in a relatively timed manner, but nothing special.  Price:  By Vegas standards, it's.... ok, but if I were paying this price elsewhere I would freak considering the quality to it. $3 for a bowl of rice? If I were to come back, it'll definitely be for the satay. I'm sure there are better Thai places out there, especially ones that's strictly for Thai instead of a combo of things that Lemongrass does.",

    "text": "First, we are Thai. This is the first Thai restaurant ever where I drank a martini before dinner and coffee after. This is the first Thai restaurant I've ever seen where people were offered and served champagne with their meal. Wine is horrid with spicy Thai food, but champagne is heaven. I'm glad the prices are high because it keeps out all the casino riff-raft and street sleaze that's all too common on the strip. We wanted to see if this restaurant could make decent traditional Thai food so we ordered some standards like tom yum goong; green curry; and white fish. The tom yum came with huge shrimpers although it lacked a good spicy kick. We requested our green curry be made with tofu and they did it. The green curry was very good, but again lacked a little kick. The white fish was great-very tasty and served with the traditional nam prik. All in all the food was very good, and very traditional. The wait staff were all Asian, but only a couple were Thai. Our waitress luckily was Thai so our family could speak Thai to her. My pet peave was piqued at this place because many of the farang patrons ate their Thai food with chop sticks. Thai people don't eat like Chinese. We use a fork and spoon for most things. We might use chop sticks if were eating a noodle soup. So put your chop sticks down when in a Thai restaurant and use a spoon and fork!!! We recommend this place. Good service. Good Thai food. If Vegas strip prices bother you, you may want to ask yourself what the hell are you doing on the strip to begin with????? You've gotta order champagne and satay. It goes great together.",

Nice selection of house wines although we had been led to believe they served Cakebread wines, which they don't. But oh well. After a wait of about 30 minutes they offered us early seating in the bar. Hold out for the table lol. The seating in the bar is very comfortable and leans you back ALOT so isn't the easiest to eat from. The back cushion kept moving and that detracted from the whole dining experience. We started with the pot stickers. The port could have used some salt and seasoning. It was very bland, given the chili vinegar soy sauce had no punch that was a disappointment. For my entree I had Phad Thai Ghoong and it was delicious. A very large portion of noodles very well seasoned. I like it on the hot side and could have gone hotter than the 5 I asked for. But every place rates differently so its a learning process. There were four good sized shrimp in my entree and the peanuts were on the side for me to add. All in all it was a good dish. The atmosphere is bright and interesting, a little noisy for hanging out and talking. More of a go and be seen place but still was fun. Will I go again? Not until I try all the Thai places Vegas has socked away. It was good but didn't take my breath away. Nice if you are on the strip and don't want to wander to far.",

Hers was quite dry, and mine was just pure black pepper bomb, not a whole lot of of balanced flavors.   On the plus side, our server was great and the thai tea was great. Portions were huge too.

My hunny and his sister ate the dim sum and they got the soupy little pot sticker. And a shrimp and pork one.   Then we ordered 3 soups I ordered the spicy meat one with some really fat noodles. And it's was ok. I tried the meat and go my surprise it had this huge fatty piece right in the middle of the bowl and the brisket was way over cooked and dried out. And the broth was too salt and over powering with the Star annis in there.   My sis in law got the dumpling soup all of her food was really yummy. And the broth was delish and the noodles were really thin. I like here better.   And my boyfriend ordered a seafood soup with chicken broth. It has squid and all kind of things I would never eat. But he lied it. Finished the whole thing. The service was good.  I felt like it took forever for the food to come out but as sick as I was I'm sure it was not too long. I just wanted to sleep. Lol.   The price for all 3 of us was $100+ tip a little steep for a soup and the dim sums were like $15 a piece for 3 little piece and the soup ones came in 5. I wouldn't go back. But this review will go for my boyfriend because he truly loved it. And was a special treat for him and his sister. Celebrating her birthday.",

We were welcomed well and taken to the table. Server greeted well and took our order. We got our drinks and Appetizers in 10-15 minutes. Even though we ordered our main course along with the drinks and appetizer, we didn't get our food until 90+ minutes. Looks like there was a change in our server which we were not aware of. Some other server came to us after 60 minutes and said kichen is backlogged and we are still waiting for our food. During the same process, there were people who came after us more than 30 minites later, got their food. At 90 minute mark, when i asked the other server who said kichen is backlogged about the food; He went back and got us our food. The food he got was not hot and looks like the food was prepared like time and waiting for someone to be pickedup. The fried rice was so dried.   When i asked about this to server, no appology in return. He said let me talk to my manager.",

What makes this place unique is you can choose your level of spice from 1- 10. I am a spice lover! I eat everything with tabasco and every place that I eat at their level of \"spicy\" is very mild for me.   I was very surprised because I tried their level 9 for my stir fry and it gave me a good spice kick. The flavor of the Tom Yum soup was sour and sweet, absolutely delicious! I wish it was sourer but it was still good. If you're in Vegas, looking for some good Asian food, this is your spot!",

We always start with the spicy asian cucumbers. Just the right amount of heat. Next is the satay, the chicken satay is our favorite. If you like spicy food this is the place for you. The basil meats are amazing. We prefer the chicken or shrimp. Yes they have a heat scale of 1 to 10, but it does change so play it safe. I love hot food and even for me it can be too much. I have learned to never go over a 5 or 6, but again depending on the peppers that can feel like fire. The taste of the food here is amazing. I never have trouble getting in for lunch, but weekend dinners require a reservation or a lengthy wait. The bar area is open seating. If you're near the Aria make sure to try this wonderful restaurant.",

We ordered several dishes to try (names of items on the photo).  The food is above average. It's missing an authentic taste in my opinion. Most of the food is on the bland side and it's not as spicy as one would like. Thai food needs to be spicy, a little sour, and a lot of flavor. Of all the dishes I ordered, I recommend the Coconut soup with Lobster; they give you a good amount of lobster.  Overall, the food is reasonably priced for a casino restaurant on the Strip. The service was excellent and there are a lot of varieties of food; a lot of vegetarian options. We have ate at this restaurant several times and the experience has been great.  PS. The restrooms are individual unisex restrooms and there are multiple ones, which is good.",

At home in oahu, Hawaii there is 1-2 good restaurants and a few back ups.  First of all the service would be laughed at in Thailand. Our server over poured the hot water in the tea cup and said oh yeah as I walked the water spilled over and so that's why there is so much water in the tea cup plate. But no offer of bringing a dry one, so okay. Then the medium steak with tamarind sauce arrived and the medium steak was an edge under well done. My pho broth was hmmmm just okay not the awesome broth you would think a Thai restaurant would have. The category I'd put this in would be in the 3rd or even 4th tier Thai restaurant but paying 1st tier price. Watching others eat the beef satay sticks was not uplifting either but smelled good.  Either way I would not recommend this restaurant to any friend or family and just wait till you go back home and try the one next to the Kapolei theater. That one is authentic and full of flavor and great service. Is 2 stars to high?   Good luck",

Service was also good...except what leads us into the bad below.  The bad - the fried rice sucks.  It was super burned and we told the waitress and instead of offering an alternative, she just said \"ok.\"  The single star removal was for the crappy rice as the rest of her service was very good.

Coming from Vancouver I think I'm pretty spoiled when it comes to authentic Chinese and Thai food, so it's pretty hard to be blown away while travelling.   Lemongrass is a good for when you absolutely feel like you need to have Thai or Chinese food, but  I find the dishes lack those aromatic and complex Thai flavours that Thai food is known for. As for the Chinese food, you may be able to find something more exciting at a mall food court...?   Make sure you specify the level of spiciness you want for your dish (level 1-10) if applicable. I find the servers tend to forget to ask if you don't tell them.   I would recommend ordering 1 dish if you are dining by yourself as the portions are pretty big. Or if you're in a group ordering a few dishes to share family style!  In all, I expected a little bit more from Lemongrass as it is in a higher end hotel.",

The only reason I'm taking off half a point is because the way the tables are set up make it difficult for diners to get the attention of their servers. Other than that, I loved the atmosphere!   Service 4/5: Service was a little slower than expected because of the reason noted above, but they were kind. I got a Thai coffee that was way too bitter for me, and they were more than happy to replace it with the Thai tea with no extra surcharge (I had a few sips of the coffee). The dim sum cart only comes out every 20ish minutes, which was annoying because we sat down right when the cart went back into the kitchen. We had to wait awhile to order from the cart.  Food 3/5: From the dim sum cart, we got the turnip cake (good but was soggy--could be crispier), shu mai (my personal fave of the meal), and har gow (good but the skin was way too thick). We also got the Young Chow fried rice, which was delicious with the medley of veggies and meat mixed in. The chow fun noodles had wayyyy too much noodles compared to the amount of toppings, and flavors were a bit lacking.   Overall the food met our low expectations (it's dim sum in Vegas...of course we had low expectations), and the service was good. Because the prices are a bit hefty for Chinese food that can be made with better quality, I'm not too sure I would return. I would definitely give it a try if you're interested!",

Being lover's of Asian cuisine, we were truly impressed and so happy we ended up here.   We ordered the tasting menu, because 4 courses for $49 a person was unbeatable. We also added the drink pairings, which was $29 a person. The first course came out, and we were pleasantly surprised with the size of the appetizer (we figured we'd be sharing). The Satay's were perfectly cooked, wonderfully seasoned, and the perfect portion. Then the soup came out, it was hot with the perfect amount of spice. Our entrees came out which were hugely portioned and so flavorful. My pad thai was filled with shrimp, and his curry had the perfect balance of flavors. The dessert was dynamite and didn't push me over the edge. Plus side, the drinks paired perfectly with the courses and were a great size.   The cherry on top of this experience was our servers Amber and Pittaya. Our waters were never empty, they were helpful with questions, brought out the courses at the right time, and assured us this would be plenty of food. This has easily become top 5 of our favorite restuarants in Vegas. It is not authentic Thai cuisine, but an exceptional fusion of fine dining and Thai food. If you want a phenomenal fine dining experience that's not a steakhouse, this is the place for you.",

The restaurant was dimly lit and had a romantic feel to it. We all wanted something soupy, so we ordered the wonton noodle soup, chicken wings, and two tom yam soups.  Our food arrived pretty quickly and the bowls were pretty big. I personally ordered the tom yam soup with shrimp and it was alright. There were a lot of mushrooms in it and the broth was a bit tangy, but didn't taste authentic. Overall, everyone thought that the food was just alright and overpriced.",

We hoped for a bar spot but nothing came available. After 15min we were seated. Service was great and fast. We ordered shrimp steamed dumplings, pork stickers, sesame chicken and prawn rolls. The prawn rolls were ok but nothing special. Everything else was absolutely delicious. The sesame chicken is probably some of the best ever had. Pricey place but really good for late night appetizing dining!",

We came in on a Thursday night and were seated right away. To start, we ordered spring rolls and seaweed salad both of which were super tasty. Next, we ordered Chicken Green Curry and Shrimp Pad Thai. They asked how spicy from 1-10, with 3 being a medium. The green curry was a #3 and a pad Thai was a #5. The former was quite spicy, where the later was not very spicy at all. Despite, it was sooooo freaking yummy and the portions were huge. I am so glad we came to this place and definitely plan to return!",

The service was excellent. the ho spent so much time deciding which table would be best for us (and them) because we had a stroller. The table was perfect. Service was fast and attentive.  the set up and decor is excellent.   Food is good. Not the best but very good and we all left full even though we didn't order a ton of food.  My favorite entree was the three cups chicken. Super flavorful. Lots of garlic and the meat was tender. My wifes complaint on the dish was that there was too much meat and not enough veggies. But thats exactly what made it so good for me.   The highlight of dinner was desert. The coconut ice cream. Id go back just for that and nothing else. Amazing.  Next time I am starting with desert and finishing with the same. It was so so so good.",

    "text": "After spending a couple of hours at the table wrestling with blackjack dealers and working up a midnight hunger, our Mexican friend said \"Lemongrass (at Aria) has the best Asian food and XLB in Vegas.  Trust me...\"  Lemongrass, like most of the restaurants on the strip, has a chic and modern decor.  Being that it's a Thai cuisine restaurant, the design also has a bit of Asian twist - all of which was nicely done. The service was terrific, attentive and friendly.  After all, it's Vegas.  So far so good...  Given it was a late night snack, we ordered mostly comfort food: Wonton Noodle Soup, Dan Dan Mian, Drunken Noodle with Seafood and Xiaolongbao (XLB or soup dumplings).  Unfortunately, Lemongrass didn't live up to the hype.  The noodle in Wonton Noodle Soup was clumpy. The drunken noodle was numbingly spicy (but that could be the fault of my friend who said he wanted it \"medium\" spicy). The dan dan mian tasted like it had chicken broth.  Probably the most disappointing was the xiaolongbao which tasted like the ones you buy at the frozen section of Ranch 99 supermarket or Costco.  Our suspicion was confirmed by the frost bitten skin that was dried at the edges.   Perhaps it was the hype from our Mexican friend but after objective evaluation and deliberation, we all agreed Lemongrass was DEFINITELY not the best Asian restaurant in Vegas.  Next time, I'm gonna tell my Mexican friend that I know the best Mexican restaurant and take him to Taco Bell.",

They have plenty of options on the menu, from dim sum, noodles, stir fry, etc and they are reasonably priced. You would think because the restaurant is on The Strip you would pay more and get less food but it is not True at Lemongrass. You can also ask for items to be made spicy or not spicy. This time we tried the Garlic and lime steam cod, beef broccoli, and the Soft She'll Crab fried rice ( I always get this).",

There weren't a lot of people there, yet. (Pokemon Go fans, there is a gym for you to battle or spin for items).  I ordered the stir fry choy sum with rice and tea. The others ordered beef red curry (medium spicy), drunken noodle, papaya salad (medium spicy), and shaved ice with fruits.  If you love/like tea, then order it here to enjoy with your meal. The tea came in a teapot and a small tea cup. The tea brand is Tealeaves.  We shared the dishes. My younger sister was so impress with the quality of the food, she wanted to back again before we leave.  The hostess and waiter came by to check how the food tasted and also top off our water. The place have low lighting so you can enjoy your food and take your time. Even as the restaurant began to get busier, I never felt rushed.  My sisters and I would come back again.

The Walnut lobster was super loaded with breading and kinda soggy. The rice in the softshell crab fried rice was hard and kinda flavorless. We had the basil and crab omelette which was super salty. Ginger soy sauce seabass was probably one of the worst ways I've ever had it prepared... And it's probably one of my favorite fishes.   The homestyle tofu was ok, but you only get 5 small pieces of fried tofu with some veggies per order.   We were starving when we ordered the food, but i can't even say the food was ok. The food was actually so bad we didn't finish any of it and for the price, the only thing my stomach was filled with was disappointment.",

The chicken feet wasnt as flavorful and the crab claw was cold. The tripe was super bland and chewy.  As for the chili oil used, it was all oil and barely any chili!

We ordered the salmon spring rolls for an appetizer. These were top notch...salmon, cheese, and basil fried in a slim roll with sweet chili dipping sauce. I ordered the Pad See Ewe (spelling?) at a spicy level 3 out 10 and the man ordered Pad Thai with Chicken at level 5. The Pad See Ewe was just ok, I'm not sure it was meant for spiciness and it also needed more veggies! The Pad Thai was excellent!   Only real issue was the bartender, who doubled as our server. He was loud and ignorant...we found many of his comments to be inappropriate and offensive.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner and will definitely be coming back. I had the yellow curry with beef and steamed rice. Delicious!    Prices weren't bad, most of the main dishes were between $14-20. Seafood was a little more pricey of course. When I ordered water I opted for the free tap water as opposed to a $9 bottle of Fiji water. I just don't see myself ever paying $9 for water.   My only complaint is the service. We were seated right away which was great, but after we got our waters we waited another 10-15 minutes to order our food even though we were ready to order after a couple of minutes. We had to wait to make eye contact with our waiter across the room to ask for a water refill. Waiting to ask for the check took another 15 minutes. If the restaurant was busy I would totally understand but it really wasn't.",

I mean everything, well besides the spring rolls, the panang curry, which has no Fish, tasted like Fish. The fried rice also tasted like Fish. I voiced my distaste with the manager; however, I was not even credited and nothing was removed from the bill.  With how much competition there is in Vegas, this place isn't worth it.",

    "text": "Lemongrass sits tucked inside the Aria Casino just off the middle of the floor in an alcove with another restaurant.  While waiting to check into the Vdara next door, I asked the concierge about great local restaurants for lunch.  She recommended Lemongrass.  Arriving just after 2 pm on Wednesday, I was seated in a mostly empty restaurant that was in a nice open area just off the main floor but strangely had a darkened interior.  To be honest, it was bothersome, as if management had dimmed the lighting to tell people to get the heck out.  It contrasted widely with the well lit slot machines just a few walks away.  Waitstaff was quick but the Asian staff was reserved and didn't engage in anything other than light conversation.  I decided to go with one of my favorite, Chicken Pad Thai.  From past experiences in traditional Thai restaurants, this is one dish that is easy to make, but also easy to screw up and serves as a good litmus test.  While the menu was impressive, the pricing was not.  There is no distinction between lunch and dinner pricing, so my order cost $18.  The meal arrived was a large, very savory portion almost twice what a lunch portion would consists of.  Considering this was a $18 dish, I decided to half it and take the rest for a snack.  True to expectations, the dish was chock full of the standard ingredients with lots of chicken, noodles, peppers, carrots, onions, and bean sprouts.  Overall, it was very tasty, and joined with a kettle of Hot Green Tea, it filled me up and prepared me for the rest of the day.  Overall, I think Lemongrass is a great place.  Considering the location inside the Aria, I expected the higher-than-normal pricing but was turned off by the dark interior but at least pleased with the quiet environment.  Location was convenient and staff was quick and efficient at both service and busing tables.  Overall, I give it four out of five stars.",

They sat us on a big beautiful leather couch at a table - it was a very comfortable and luxurious place to enjoy lunch.  The service was friendly, but a bit slow.  But the restaurant was so beautiful and they refilled our water and tea frequently so I didn't mind spending more time enjoying my lunch.  The food was fantastic.  They offer a tasting menu regularly for $59 that was very similar to the $30.14 menu they offered during restaurant so I know we got a great value on the meal while donating to charity.  The starter was a chicken satay and cucumber salad.  The peanut sauce was very good.  Then they serve a small mushroom Tom Yum Hed.  The flavor in the soup was great and I would go back to eat just that.  Then for the main entree we choose to have the Phad Thai with Shrimp.  I loved the pad thai and the shrimp were a good size and fresh.  The highlight of the meal was the dessert - an ice cream with sticky sweet rice, coconut, jackfruit and fruit jellies.  The coconut and jackfruit were very fresh and the ice cream tasted great with the rice.",

Meat in both our curries was extremely hard (I would call it a shoe sole in German, not sure if that translates to English though). I am still marveled how you can produce a tough chicken inside a curry. Our weakest meal while we were here.",

Back to Lemongrass though. It's thai-fusion and not all I'd hoped for especially with how much I love thai food. I'd be happier with more \"normal\" thai food than this spot. We tried to get the seaweed salad to start but had to send it back because it was so strange and fishy. The other dishes were not memorable either and it wasn't inexpensive. We had wine which was pretty good but the food was just not worth it. If I were to stay at the Aria again, I'd choose other restaurants for sure.

For entrees, we got the mee goreng, pretty average overall in portion and flavor (nothing special), sesame chicken tasted like typical Americanized Asian food and batter was soggy, and finally the Cantonese chow mein which was ordered as crispy but was definitely burned on all edges and tasted bitter and charred (definitely not the way my mom used to make it).

Service was OK at the best. I would go somewhere else for Thai food or drinks.",

We had a ton of food this visit since I was dying for rice. The Thai food is of course somewhat westernized but when you are Asian and haven't eaten rice in a few days you don't really care. Highlights were the satay,  the pork satay was exceptional. Fried egg with crab meat was really good with the rice. Curry lacked much of the flavors of basil, fish sauce and kaffir lime leaves and was bland. This place is no Lotus of Siam but it is good with a great central location and a cool comfortable atmosphere. You rice eaters will find some comfort here when the craving kicks in.",

    "text": "I am from Atlanta and I thought I have had the best of the best Thai food already. This spot in the Aria hotel/ casino has blown my mind. I loved the food so much that I had to stop by one last time before leaving Vegas! I was with a large group so we all ordered a little bit of everything. Here are some of the dishes that stood out the most to me:   1. Penang curry with duck- you would think the duck was the star in this dish...if you did you are wrong. The curry sauce was so delicious. I would eat all the sauce with plain rice and still walk out a happy customer.  2. Tom yum w/ seafood- this soup is sweet, sour, and spicy. The ginger and lemongrass was not hidden and lost in the soup, all the flavors for a good yum yum soup was present. The best part is...there's HUGE shrimps and lots of squid and oyster mushrooms in the soup. The broth to meat/veggies ratio was good. I have been to other places that had too much broth and not much of anything in the soup.  3. Papaya salad- tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a well made basic papaya salad.  4. Sea bass- the portion was a little smaller than I expected but the fish was great. It was nice and fatty and not dry while the skin was super crispy.  5. Beef salad- it was my first time trying a beef salad but I really liked it. Never would I think to add grapes to a beef salad with fish sauce and chilies but it worked.   We ordered a lot more food but these were the ones I enjoyed the most. My next visit to Vegas I will definitely be stopping by Lemongrass!",

The boyfriend ordered the seafood noodle soup...delish.  Daddy ordered the shrimp wonton noodle soup...delish.  I ordered the yellow curry with beef (special request for the beef, since the menu only says chicken).  They asked how spicy I wanted it, from 1-10.  I ordered an 8...which had a great kick to it!  It was yummy & full of flavor.    Only disappointment was on the menu, they give a few different options for rice.  Sticky rice wasn't an option, but I asked anyway...and they had it!  Still a disappointment...sticky rice is supposed to be eaten with your hands...and it wasn't manageable with my fingers...had to use a spoon.  Btw...they close @ 2am.  Ordered a pho to go at 1:30am after a long night of gambling.  YUM.  Lots of meat!",

We started off with their awesome prawn  rolls, shared a chillean seabass, a lobster fried rice(was on their specials menu) and duck penang curry. All of these entrees were amazing and they made them with just the right amount of spicyness.  We asked for a 4/5.... and we were sweating ever so slightly...PERFECT :).  We ordered every single drink on the cocktail menu, all of which were awesome.  We opted not to get dessert, but our waiter was really nice and bought us a fried banana on the house.

The dim sum was what we started with, which is like a choice of dumplings (at extremely reasonable prices).  Also ordered the drunken noodles and basil chicken.  They do warn you about the spice level, but it's even spicier than I assumed it would be.  I like spicy food but even at a \"2 out of 10\" spice level I still definitely needed a lot of water.  If you don't like spicy at all you need to order a 1 (They let you choose how spicy.).  Service was kind of weird and very teamwork-oriented and you had to ask for service, but I'm pretty sure that's normal for the kind of restaurant.  I wouldn't know though since it's my first Thai experience.  Overall, I will definitely go back on a future trip to Vegas.",

So we remembered we had seen a Thai restaurant in Aria years earlier, and decided to go look for that...good thing Aria was connected to Monte Carlo.  We ordered the Basil Beef Fried Rice and Drunken Noodle with Seafood...and oh my, we sure loved it!  It had good texture and flavor.  A year later, my sister and I went to Vegas again and went to eat here again.  We ordered the same two items and also ordered the Sampan Spicy Crab...I was loving it!

I eat a LOT of thai food and I have to say that Lemongrass has some of the better Thai food I've eaten, not the best, but it's very good.  I often started with the chicken satay which is standard but good and/or the tom yum soup which had a bit more flavor than a number of other tom yum soups I've had.  For the entree, I've had a number of things. My favorite Thai dishes are yellow curry and panang curry and Lemongrass offers high quality curries, both had good flavor and spice without overwhelming and the consistency of the curry was correct as well, not too runny like some places. They have plenty of fried rice options which are good and also offer a good pad see ew. One of the times I was there, a friend got the crab which was a full crab on a plate. I'm allergic, but it was very cool to see and looked incredibly fresh and delicious.   Overall, I always enjoyed Lemongrass and would gladly recommend it to others.",

The Thai restaurant in San Diego in our neighborhood has better flavor. Aria advertises this place as the only Thai place on the Strip....well...thy best kick up their game as the #1 spot is up for grabs.  We asked for spicy,..it was not.   The Chilli sauce condiment bowl was empty. We brought this to the attention of the waiter. Bowl was refilled, not washed or cleaned prior with the old Chilli still dried to the wall of the container.   The Chicken Salad tasted bad and merely looked like it was boiled and processed through a meat grinder! ..it was bad and something I wouldn't feed my beagle.  We wanted to order a drink with Ginger - they were out of ginger.   We announced a special occasion - they forgot.   Flavor wise - it was all mediocre  ...I woke up the next day thinking about how bad it was. I will call the restaurant today and suggest management sit under cover, and eat the tasting menu. As Gordon Ramsey would say to the chef \"did you taste it?\"",

I expected pretentiousness, overpriced small-portioned dishes, and mediocre flavor. What I actually got (both visits so far), is friendly and responsive service, generous portions, and extremely fresh and well-balanced flavors.  This place is now on my list of places to go every time I'm in Vegas. And it rivals most places I've been to in the Portland, OR area. The prices are a little higher, but not egregious. Myself and two friends had quite a good feast for under $90.",

It is Americanized to a large extent but if you consider that your in the middle of the Las Vegas strip,  it's a cool place.  This time around the food was pretty much a salt bomb.  They have expediting issues as two groups of guests who showed up after us received their food first *and* finished  On top,  everything was super salty.  Even for my palate,  which loves salt.    To be fair most of the time when I order lemongrass its pretty spot on and I typically order it frequently since I play poker  But still not much of an excuse.  The house did offer free desert.  For what that's worth",

It came over fried. Fish doesn't not need to  so fried, the meat will just be hard. Even the stick rice was steamed not to well either. Cooking rice all my life, this person, definitely did not know how to cook sticky rice. And the som tum, flavorless. These folks has never eat papaya said in real places of Thailand, Thai town in LA. I even make it better myself. I wanted hot, 4 peepers, tasted more like one peeper. Clearly this place is catered to westerners or folks who had never eaten (real) Thai  foods before. All I can say was, was so looking forward to it, and was very disappoint.",

Not only does the environment look and makes me feel good, the food is good! Also there's so many of these hidden little gems I'd have to come back to Vegas a few more times just to try them all!   On a crave for Asian food so we came here. My girls and I started off with sticky rice in those leaves and some dim sum. Of course a bit on the pricey side, but nonetheless GOOD food. We shared the Young Chow Fried Rice and the Mee Goreng.  I like that their food isn't too salty. It captures the right taste and has such good flavor! Their food is made fresh and their presentation is decent. Yummy food here!",

The service is fast and very friendly. It started with a lovely soup with mushrooms and vegetables that was mildly spicy for me and more spicy for my friend. Our appetizers were the chicken and beef satay skewers and they were amazing. For my main meal, I had the Panang curry chicken. I asked for it to be as mild as possible. From a scale of 1 to 10, I asked for one. The meal was so good. It was not spicy which I loved, but it could have been made very spicy for someone who enjoys that. My friend ordered the shrimp pad Thai and asked that it be spicier. They honored that! The beauty of this restaurant is that I like Thai food a lot, but I am unable to tolerate very spicy food. This restaurant always successfully manages to create delicious meals that are either very mild or very spicy, depending on how one likes it. Dessert was a scoop of mango sorbet which was very nice on the palate. The prices are reasonable, the restaurant is beautiful, the food is delicious, and the service is always friendly. Highly recommended!",

But I don't get sticking the lime on the glass. Maybe a pineapple or shaved coconut would be more appropriate, just a suggestion if you're reading this, Lemongrass peeps.

The only places that were still open at the Aria was Lemongrass and their 24 hour cafe. Without much deliberation, we came here hungry but also not expecting much.   We ordered the red curry with duck and vegetables and wow, it was a huge portion of duck, pineapple, green eggplant (fairly certain it was eggplant lol), red and green peppers, bamboo shoots, and cherry tomatoes. I was quite impressed by the sweetness of the curry with the tastiness of the overall dish. The jellyfish appetizer that I was happy to see on the menu wasn't good though as it was very rubbery. I've eaten a lot of jellyfish and this was something that definitely looked like it but wasn't quite there. I even tried adding chili sauce to mask the rubberness but that didn't work haha  Now I know the reviews overall haven't been great here but there are positives: A. open till 2 am /// B. restaurant decor is nice /// C. food looks authentic  Honestly, I would normally never choose a place like this to have a dinner when I usually only get 2-3 nights per visit in Vegas and there's TOO many restaurants to choose from. The thing was that all the places I had on my list to try were already closed and we were staying at the Aria and this was open. I'm not sure about the rest of the menu but the red duck curry made for a satisfying meal that won't leave you feeling stuffed to enjoy the rest of the night.",

However, nothing here, other than when dim sum is served at lunch, stands out.  Again, the food is good, but not really better than any other Asian-fusion restaurant found in other parts of the country. If you are near Lemongrass, give it a try. I have checked-in 6 times, and dined there many more. If you are there when the dim sum carts are out, do yourself a favor and dine there! The dim sum is a good as I have had in Beijing or Shanghai. Yep, just as good and authentic.",

We walked into the restaurant around noon on Sunday and noticed a sign that they also served dim sum here. Looking at their menu, Lemongrass is advertised as thai food, but there's also chinese and vietnamese food on the menu.   Thai Iced Tea- (3/5) it was okay, slightly too creamy Chicken Wings- (3/5) the wings without the sauce didn't have much flavor and tasted better with the sweet chili sauce. However, you can get the sauce from a bottle at an Asian market. Tom Kha soup- (1/5) enough for 4 bowls, dried chicken pieces and mushy mushroom, no other veggies Chicken Pad Thai (lvl 6)- (3/5) didn't have the tradition sweet taste of pad thai and tasted mostly like spicy  I think if you're really really craving thai, I guess this place is okay. However, if you can drive a little off the strip, you're better off going to a hole in the wall thai restaurant. You'll probably get much more authentic food for a quarter of the price.",

Having been to Singapore earlier this year, I was excited to see a Seafood Singapore Laksa, which is supposed to be a spicy, coconut milk soup with complex flavors. What they gave me was completely, utterly flavorless. It had the opacity of coconut milk, but none of the taste. It's as if they had just plain water (not any kind of broth) and splashed in some coconut milk for color. I started with the lobster satay, which was excellent as always, but was sorely disappointed with the laksa. Stick to the Thai dishes!",

    "text": "Both my boyfriend and I love Thai food. As luck would have it, there was a Thai restaurant located in the Aria and we decided to make it our last meal in Vegas. It was a great decision and I highly recommend giving it a try.  I stuck to my usual order of chicken phad see ew. Oddly, the menu only lists three meat/veggie options for each dish and the phad see ew only offered a choice of pork, seafood or veggie. For comparison's sake, the phad thai listed chicken, shrimp and veggie. I decided to take a chance and inquire about substituting chicken instead and they easily made the change with no questions. I'm not sure why the menu only lists certain protein options for each dish but I was pleased to see that they're not strict on that.   My phad see ew was absolutely delicious. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say it's one of the best that I've ever eaten, which is a good thing as it's also probably the most expensive at $18. While it was a little hard to justify spending nearly twice as much on the same dish, the quality of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant made it worthwhile.   My boyfriend ordered the home style tofu with rice at a spice level of ten. Our waiter warned him that it's extremely spicy but my boyfriend grew up eating New Mexican green chiles and always asks for high spice levels at Thai and Indian restaurants. He's usually disappointed that they fail to reach his desired spice level but the spiciness here is no joke. He was pleased that they actually lived up  to their warning.   I also decided to splurge on a Thai iced tea and it, too, was very good and gave me the caffeine burst I needed to make it through the rest of our final day in Vegas.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and would make a great date night spot with the dim lighting and quiet setting.",

It almost seems like you are sitting in a giant basket with all the woven work above you.  To start, we got crispy shrimp spring rolls. SO good, well executed. SO good that they were gobbled up before the photo opp. I got the red curry as my main, 8/10 on the spice level and it did not disappoint. It is the best red curry that I have ever had. Pineapple, bamboo shoots.. everything was in there. Make sure and order jasmine rice on the side to really enjoy it. I had half to take home as leftovers. I like that they come to your table to fill the to-go boxes with your food. My dinner partner had sweet and sour chicken and she enjoyed it. It had a kick to it, that is for sure. I give that dish a 5 too. (She gave it a 3 which shocked me a bit but it is all a matter of taste!) If I could tele-transport myself back there right now I would.

The cushion was soft and there was a pillow. I love the design inside and atmosphere was cozy. I loved the place where we sat. Came here to try the dinner. We ordered the beef satay and spicy cucumber for appetizer. The beef satay was delicious! I liked the sauce that came with it. Spicy cucumber was pretty good. The only thing I would say is I wish it was more crunchy but it was fine.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken dish and I ordered the big crab dish. I told them I can't eat spicy well so they made the crab non spicy for me. Big portion and it was yummy. They give you wet towels on the side. My boyfriend chicken dish came with steam rice so I had some of his rice. His chicken dish was delicious as well. Chicken was tender and sauce was yummy. My crab had plenty of crab meat and it was yummy. Our server was very friendly, although I would have to comment that I wish he was more attentive to us. I understand it was busy but customer service is very important. The other servers and workers attended to us and they were very friendly and fast. I think our server was just tied up so he had help. I wish I had save more room for dessert but we ordered a lot and we had to take it to go.  Definitely will come back here.",

I was completely wowed by everything: the ambiance, the service (for the most part), the drinks, the food, and the price!  I LOVED the vibes of this place, and the gorgeous fresh flowers that were outside the restaurant. What a beautiful sight! Our service was outstanding: our server was so friendly and accommodating. I was very impressed by the wine that we shared, and it was a good price too!  I ordered the chicken \"pad thai\" (I remember the spelling being a little different, but you get the idea). I loved the spice level! My sister got the green curry and it was absolutely fantastic. We shared a few of the appetizers with the table as well, which were tasty before the meal. I was on the fence about a 5-star rating, but the other five girls got their meals before I did, and mine didn't come out for about 5ish minutes after. I felt as though maybe they had forgotten my order. Overall, a fantastic choice for Vegas dining! I will definitely go back when I'm in town!",

The food came out within 15 minutes.  That fried rice was one of the best I have ever had! Great flavors!! The chicken was very tender and fresh!  I enjoyed every bite! ! Bank was very attentive during the entire dinner.  Definitely eat here as you won't be disappointed! !",

I would normally just give the place 3 stars, since the prices don't really reflect the level of food you'd expect. The food was good, like any Thai food you'd get for 8-10 bucks would be. However, the duck curry was pretty unique and good, albeit pretty petty portioned in comparison to the economy-sized curry that was as big as my face. The shrimp in each of the dishes that had seafood was amazing! They were so fresh that biting into it, your teeth snapped into the shrimp. I have only had shrimp this good in one other place, which is now closed.  If you go, order something with shrimp. It's amazingly fresh.  The service was great as well. The staff was very attentive and friendly.",

The satay and Tom Yum Ghoong soup was excellent as were the satay. The chicken breast dish I had was breast meat that was over battered and the meat so dry I could not chew it or swallow it. My partshrimp entree was good, but not excellent. The mango sticky rice desert was good. The fried bananas were terrible. The menu and cooking seems to be dominated by Chinese influence. May be part of the reason it was lacking. Service was good through the entrees and then everyone disappeared. Had to grab someone from another section to get desert and the check at the same time. Really wish I could have had better things to say.",

When we finally did find this restaurant, we sat down and looked at the menu.  I was shocked to see Thai food so expensive and so overpriced.  Can you believe they were trying to sell pad thai for like $16??!  I was shocked.  I can find better tasting pad thai for less than half the price they were selling their's for.  I ended up just ordering a bowl of their wonton soup for $14.  Yes, $14!!  There was nothing great about it.  The wontons were good, but the overall soup tasted like it came out of a Top Ramen bag.  Totally disappointing.  One of my friends ordered the pepper shrimp which was good, but a bit on the salty side.  Their pineapple fried rice was good I do have to say.    My advice is  save yourself some $$$ and dine somewhere else.  Personally, I like Archie's Thai Restaurant on Flamingo.  Food is great and affordable.  Or if you don't want to that, try YELPing a few places.  :)",

First of all, the decor and atmosphere is fantastic. Very trendy yet comfortable. The service was prompt and they were very helpful in helping us decide what to order.  I actually tried their watermelon juice; its delicious. As for the food, we had beef satay, yellow curry, spicy seasame chicken, chicken & basil, and the wings. All were absolutely spectacular. Good size portions, very tasty, and definitely filling.  Once we left I immediately called a good friend of mine who frequently stays at Aria and had to tell him about it.

    "text": "We decided to have Thai tonight with the excitement of a trip to The Strip. Unfortunately Lemongrass didn't impress us any more than some of Aria's other offering have so far.  I ordered an appetizer of satay chicken sticks and the wife had vegetable spring rolls. The rolls were OK but not amazing, my satay sticks were mediocre. They came well presented, but the satay sauce was a tad bland. I'm usually willing to overlook this because I know this is a property of Thai satay, with my own preference usually leaning strongly toward Malaysian or Indonesian satay which tends to be spicier and nuttier in my experience, however the chicken itself was bland and nearly tasteless beyond the outer glaze and clearly hadn't enjoyed the hours of marinade-bathing essential to imbue a stick with a good flavour.  For mains we ordered Pad Thai \"J\" (for the wife) and I ordered Chicken Mee Goreng. My wife rued the lack of a strong peanut taste in her pad thai which was overwhelmed with chunky vegetables. She felt the dish lacked finesse and looked like it had just been plopped down on the plate.  My Mee Goreng was bland and gluey. I would chalk this down to poor ordering on my part, with with the rest of the meal suffering similar issues I think it's more of a quality issue. I was surprised how tasteless my meal was, considering we were informed of the restaurant's 1 to 10 heat scale in which 2-3 means \"medium\" and decided to go for a \"4\" meaning a bit spicier than medium. What I got was a 1 by any scale I've used for measuring spiciness.  While the restaurant looks nice here, the food simply isn't. For half the price you can enjoy far superior Thai fare at any number of establishments around the city. Even our generic fountain lemonades that we had to drink cost a staggering SIX DOLLARS each bringing the price of our meal up to around ninety dollars after tip for two appetizers, two noodle dishes and non-alcoholic beverages. For that sort of coin I expect my tastebuds to have their socks blown not only off, but then discovered in someone's backyard several states away a few days later. Lemongrass didn't impress me at all and I see no reason to return.",

However no one in our party liked the food, we got the yellow curry so did our friends and we all thought that it was the most tasteless and bland curry we've ever had! It was as if they ran out of curry and added loads of water to it to make more of it, it was loaded with tasteless potatoes and bitter onions....such a big disappointment. We got chicken satay for appetizers and that one was pretty good although nothing special or unique. The service was subpar as our waiter wouldn't come to check on anything... We'd have to track him down to get water, our bill etc. so wouldn't recommend this place at all.

I'm a potsticker lover, so I'm always on the lookout.  These were large, with a very nice dough, steamed/fried to perfection with a nice spicy sauce.  I then moved onto sesame chicken - I know, it's Chinese, and not real original, but it was delicious, a sweet-chili sauce that wasn't cloying sweet.  The ambiance is beautiful and serene, an oasis tucked away from the casino.  Would be a nice romantic spot - but for just me, it was really enjoyable.",

    "text": "Yes, I know you could just drive down Mountain Spring Road for good cheap Asian restaurants. But, when you're looking for something nice and classy, I think Lemongrass hits the spot.  Been here a couple times and I don't have much to complain about.  They have a large selection of food to choose from- there's some Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese food, even dim sum on weekends.  They also offer a cool satay bar.    Sure, its a little pricey, but what else would you expect from Aria?  The quality of the food sure surpasses those of the Asian places down the street and the service is far better.  My boyfriend I really likes the spicy pepper beef udon.  My parents love the vegetarian pad thai.  And I enjoy the dim sum- especially the spicy tripe and har gao.",

    "text": "my bf and i decided to change up the scene a little for our 3 year anniversary dinner..we usually go to blossom's (which is right next to lemongrass). we just wanted to try something new and different.  lemongrass is thai cuisine resturant and is located in aria next to the barracat area in a hidden hallway. i had called beforehand to make reservations to reserve private booth and a lil early bday dessert for my boyfriend. the host who anwered my call was a bit of a bitch when i asked about these not so difficult accomodations...either she gave me that long \"ooookayyyyyy...\" as a reply or not even a thank you...who said it? i said thank you..i wish i didnt have to though.  we arrived there a little early since we were staying at the vdara next door so it was small walk to lemongrass. i told the host i had reservations and that we were 15mins early but she immediately seated us in a booth i had asked for and our server was great/polite/attentive. he was def great in customer service, wished i got his name! the aura of lemongrass was interesting..it was pretty dark than i expected it to be from looking at it from the front of the resturant.  my bf and i ordered their chicken satay as an apetitizer and damn it was so authentic and delicious! im thai, so they def got it started on the right foot! their thai teas were amazingly great and again authentic. our main entrees were the rib eye steak with tamarind sauce and basil beef fried rice. we both shared the entrees and it was amazingly YUUUMMYY!  the rib eye is something i enjoyed the most and would reccommend.  the basil fried rice was surprisingly spicy..esp for myself..i loveeeee spicy food so that was a lot coming from me.  later our server came to surprise my bf with their mango and sweet rice dessert witha  candle in it. guess what, it was complimentary! it is originally $7 but since it was a bday dessert they gave it to us for free!  overall, this is a much cheaper alternative to blossom but still a great place to eat and get full...also to have a nice private lil dinner.",

    "text": "So I really want to give this place 3.5 stars but there isn't that option on my phone. So I will be on the safe side and put three. It was pretty good. One of the fancier Thai places I have been to. But I have had better Thai food at small mom and pop shops. We are staying at Aria and we needed an easy place to dine with a two year old. This seemed to be a better option than the cafe.  The service was fast and cordial. They left us alone, in a good way, for the most part. My water was constantly refilled.   We ordered the chicken satay. The chicken was moist but I have had better peanut sauce at many other places. So I would probably recommend something else. It didn't wow me but I still enjoyed eating it. Next we got the pad Thai with prawns and the soft shell crab salad. Both were tasty, lots of flavors. The salad had mint, onion, pepper and some other herbs and spices. The crab was good but a little salty for my taste. The pad Thai was pretty good. Not much to say about it though.   All in all it was decent food and casual but nice atmosphere. I would not travel out of my way to eat here and I wouldn't really recommend someone to go there either. But if you do find yourself at Aria and craving some fancier Thai food then go ahead and try it.",

Stir Fry- really was not what we expected.  The plate came out with bok choy with like a thick/clear garlic sort of sauce.  It tasted good, but we were expecting a veggie stir fry.

    "text": "We stopped by this restaurant as we were heading back up to our room (Aria sky suites ftw!). I'll keep this short since I was a bit tipsy that night (lol off of two Midori Sours - sad I know!).  I ordered the Papaya salad ($10). It has the fish/crab sauce and has a strong smell, but it's delicious! A bit pricey compared to other Thai places, but the salad tasted better than most papaya salads that I've from these other places. It's not as spicy as other ones, but I actually like the level of spicyness here because I prefer to not have a runny nose while I'm eating it. My boyfriend ordered the drunken noodles with seafood ($20). It had large pieces of shrimp and squid that were very flavorful. They give you enough to feed two people - I was helping him finish his. It's also quite spicy, so beware! I do enjoy eating spicy food, but wow... my tongue was burning after a few bites! My friend had the sesame chicken ($17) with a small bowl of rice ($3). it was pretty good - I didn't detect any MSG in it, so that's good. The place is pretty big too - definitely enough for two people, and the chicken is still crispy, despite being coated in so much sauce.  Service was great - the food didn't take very long to cook, although there were hardly any customers since it was around 1:30am in the morning. Our waiters were quick in bringing out our drinks, and were nice enough box our unfinished entrees. They also refilled out waters frequently, considering how much we drank due to the spicy noodles.  Overall, I really like this place. It's spacious inside, there's booth and regular seating (I like sitting in booths!), and the tables are spacious. They're also accommodating to larger parties, even late at night. If you're not craving Thai food in Vegas and looking for a cheap fill to satisfy your munchies, then this is not the place for you. They'll be seeing me again.",

We also ordered the lobster salad and steak salad and those were good too but also very tiny! The decor is nice but a bit too modern and the seating is awkward. I guess the prices are not bad for Vegas but unfortunately, Lemongrass is just not up to par.",

However, the decor falls way above the food.  I came here late on a Friday night with my friend who gets out of work after 11.  I mostly picked off his food as I had already eaten.  I tried the veg rolls, which were tasty but not amazing and the mango sticky rice.  Both were good but only mediocar.  Looking over the menu they had few vegetarian friendly options and mostly meaty dishes.  It seemed that rather than stick traditional thai style food the menu deviated a bit.  I would come again, but only if provoked  The decor is gorgeous.  High ceilings and rich brown flavors.  If your going on a date, and looking for someplace nice, classy and romantic.  I think you would be safe picking lemongrass.",

For example, they charged extra for rice, which I thought was weird.  Their portions were huge, so maybe they could reduce the portion size a bit and include rice?

Wings were flavorless, and looked way better than they tasted. Eggrolls were not special either. We ordered a noodle dish and a soup. Soup was ordered with a spice level of 4 out of 10. We like spicy food a lot, but I swear the waitress requested a 14 out of 10!  Damn hot!!!  I don't plan on going back to Lemon Grass, primarily due to the service (or lack there of) we received from our old grumpy waitress. She was not happy to be there, never smiled once and just lacked the most basic courtesies expected from a waitress at any restaurant, let alone Vegas. Definitely nice decor, but not worth the price. The negative sour vibe from the serving staff and waitress was enough for me to not recommend.",

The menu consist of all the typical Thai entrees, like pad thai and all the thai soup BUT because we were in vegas, we wanted to go the exotic route and try different stuff on the menu.  There was 6 of us girls and we decided to do family style and order 6 entrees and shared.  We got the Soft shell fried rice, beef pepper udon noodles , fish cakes, a coconut soup , coconut flavored rib eyed and a WONTON NOODLE SOUP ( for the girl that was hungover from friday nite)    I must say...everything was really good but the soft shell fried rice... WOW.. the fried rice had big chunks of the crab meat in it.. and let me say.. they were not greedy with it at all.. there was also large soft shell crab on top of the fried rice.  IT was sooo GOOD.   the Rib eye wasnt too bad either , although im more of a seafood person than a meat eater.    The prices here , of course, was a bit pricey compared to other thai restaurant, BUT we are in Vegas!!.  But we all agreed that you get what you pay for and the food was worth the price!!",

We came in on a Saturday evening and ordered quite a feast for a party of 6.  Among the popular dish that three of us ordered - the Drunken seafood noodles.  Being the only Asian at the table, I found my dish to be completely soaked in soy sauce and lacking in all other known Thai spices.  The two other people demolished their dishes.  I loved the Tom Yam Hed soup by far.  They used fresh mushrooms rather than dried mushrooms, which really brought out the smooth texture in the mushrooms.  The broth was the perfect level of spice and flavor.  I also had the Jelly fish appetizer, which I would avoid.  There was a weird after taste that left a weird tough texture on my tongue.  Jellyfish should melt in my mouth and I would say mine was undercooked.  One con:  When we announced a birthday at the table, the waiter said he would bring out some dessert.  Little did we know we were going to get charged for it!  A little strange because if we are going to pay for something, it would be nice to get a choice in ordering it.  Perhaps it was lost in translation.",

    "text": "This place was absolutely superb all-around.  The ambiance was great, the service top-notch, and the food was best of all!    I ordered what amounted to some bone-in chunks of chicken served in a large hot pot in a spicy thai sauce with fresh basil leaves mixed in.  The restaurant lets you pick the heat level, and as I like my food spicy, I selected a heat level of 8 (out of a choice of 1-10)  -- the food served matched my personal heat taste perfectly.    I found the prices moderately high for Thai food, but not for Vegas, nor for the service and swanky ambiance offered.  As far as portions go, the item I ordered came with *plenty* of food presented nicely, and I could not posibly have eaten any more... a *very* large portion in my book that probably could have fed two.  Service was absolutely top-notch.  The server always was on top of drink refills and knew the menu extremely well (warning me as I placed my order that my choice had bones still in the chunks of chicken, for example).  He even gave excellent advice on cocktail pairings with some liqours I have never heard of (that were great, by the way).  I am a hard customer to please, but I don't have a bad thing to say about the place and that is the highest compliment I can give.  Lemongrass may be the only Thai restaurant on the Strip, but when you have one *this* good, who needs another one?",

Beef pho is, just ask for chicken and they are happy to accommodate. Don't miss out on the table side dim sum either. Tony was our waiter and he is an extremely nice an efficient person.

I'd highly recommend this restaurant for foodies on a budget since although Vegas has a tremendous set of fancy, amazing restaurants to offer, it's not within most people's price range (plus, it is extremely hard to book reservations for the places that are to die for like Robuchon!) so run towards the middle and go to Lemongrass. They strangely have dim sum at lunch hours...but besides that, they offer comfort food for $20 or less. Satisfying and delicious. The restaurant is beautiful too.

That explains why this place was the only one that we can get a reservation for a big party last minute.  The servers were all friendly... but not very attentive. We asked for water and followed up nicely 3 more times and it didnt come until we were pretty much done with our meal.  The food were nothing special. They were all blah and bland. We had their \"best appetizer\" prawn roll which looked amazing but it   was nowhere near any prawn or shrimp rolls Ive tried even in the hole in the wall type of places.   We tried pretty much all their noodle dishes. They were all not satisfying! Some dish were super spicy like the shredded pork and beancurd, and the menu didnt even say it was a spicy dish.   How can a Thai restaurant go wrong with Mango sticky rice? ... but they did. It just didnt hit the spot for us.",

    "text": "Shocked no one has reviewed this yet? Or maybe i just couldn't find it but I searched really long and hard lol  VENUE: Cute little restaurant tucked in one the corners of the Aria Hotel. Atmosphere is intimate, with dim lighting (even at 10AM in the morning). Decor is pretty modern with regular seating and bar area seating. We were sat in the bar area - tables were small but they had this small mini table pull out (very clever and smart) for additional space. Also the chairs were super comfy. Basically like mini couches (to me), which makes me wonder how wonderful the regular area seating is if they were reluctant to sit us near the bar. I'm really not sure if this place is supposed to be more chinese or thai as there are both kinds of dishes on the menu.  FOOD/DRINK: Dim sum is pretty standard so far. Got the har gow and siu Mai. As far as taste goes, a speaking as someone who has tasted Dim Sum from some solid areas (San Francisco, Houston, etc.), I would say that it was not phenomenal. Not bad, just not what I prefer. If I had to describe the taste in a sentence, it would be, \"Dim Sum for the average  American.\" Not to be offensive or anything, but my opinion is that you would like it if you haven't had better. All in all it was still pretty good, and my kudos goes out to the amount of shrimp they packed in each bite. That was one pleasant surprise that I enjoyed.  Of course, anyone who has eaten dim sum understands that you will never get full from it, so in addition to this Chinese morning tapas, we ordered off the menu. One of my favorite and wisest foodies told me that if a Thai restaurant doesn't offer Lard Na on their menu then they're not really authentic. I decided to dare Lemongrass and asked my server if they would make Lard Na for me. Two surprises: the first being that she knew that the dish was, and the second was that she was super accommodating about wanting to get it made. She even knew that there are various way you can serve the dish (more gravy like or a soupy pho-style). She charged me for the price of the Pad see ew. When it arrived, the beef was nicely marinated and tender. The noodles were slightly bland, but I will forgive it as it was not an item they typically make and serve. I should have known better because the gravy sauce with Lard Na takes a long time to get right.  SERVICE:  Our hostess and server were extremely helpful.  As we were in the bar area, the bartender was also helpful and came to check up on us. At the end when we were paying, my card had gotten rejected, and he came back and made some remark (I'm sure he intended it to be comedic) about how I should have let my boyfriend pay. I was slightly miffed and after making sure there was nothing wrong with my account (as many of you wanderlusters know, the bank might think someone stole your card if you suddenly make a purchase on the other side of the country), I asked the bartender to swipe it again. It went through. To which, he commented, \"Yeah make sure there's funds in there.\" Really dude? I don't need your accounting advice.",

    "text": "So I'm enjoying an afternoon of Vegas poker at the Aria with a few friends. We're throwing chips around, enjoying drinks, as well as our profits. None of us want to leave the table with the oil exec from Houston and the French tourist who likes to bluff. I don't know what it is but I really enjoy taking money off the French. Gonna have to look in to that. Anyway, I'm a little hungry and after my fourth greyhound I need some food. But I wanna keep it healthy and light so I call the brush. She hands me a menu to Lemongrass for table-side service which I will gladly tip her well for. I see brown rice on the menu for $5 and I ask the brush to tell them to add a side order of broccoli. She says no problem and I tip her $5 for ordering/picking it up.  She comes back a few minutes later with the bill and its for $24 and change?????? I'm  confused, and assume she mixed my order up with another but no. I tell her to hold the order and let me know what the $24 charge is for (I'm staying upstairs and assume they'd charge my room cc at some point). She said that the manager said they don't do sides of broccoli and had to order the vegetarian dinner. I again am confused and let her know the vegetarian dinner is full of brown rice, noodles, and a mixture of veggies and mushrooms (is that a vegetable or a fungus?). She said the manager said this is all they can do for me. I tell her to cancel the order and say keep the tip for your efforts.  After my button passes I take a walk across the casino to the restaurant, more like a cafe. The manager is extremely smug and rigid. I am utterly shocked by his lack of customer service to not only a gambling guest, but a hotel guest as well. He makes some snide comment about me not wanting to pay or not \"having enough\" to pay for my meal. Again, completely shocked I decide to make a statement and accidentally drop my wad of gambling c-notes on his counter which he picks up and hands back to me. Douchey as it was, this pompous cafe manager had to be put in his place.  I returned to the poker table where we shortly left to get some Nobu at Hard Rock. It was a great trip but this was more surprising than anything. I still love the Aria and their poker room, I'll just steer clear of this place.",

We added calamari and two drinks and were completely stuffed.   The calamari seemed to be battered in funnel cake batter- it was REALLY good. Chicken satay and prawn roll were included in the fixed price, they were good, nothing amazing. Main dishes were basil beef, chicken pad thai and something else... can't remember. The best part of the basil beef was the giant onion ring it was served in, kind of like a bowl.Desert was good as well, but don't remember what it was besides being in warm coconut milk.    Overall I was left with a ... meh.... impression. Very nice place, food was good, service was good. But seriously, how can you really spruce up Thai food? I get it locally where I live and pay $15 for food for two people with leftovers and its just as good. I wouldn't come here expecting to be impressed, its just plain old good Thai food.",

Upon further inspection of the bad reviews and a meal during a typical day of the week at 5:30PM, the general consensus is unfortunately True. The service was horrid, the food came out incredibly slow, and they never checked up on us once after the meal was out. I ordered Phad Thai and my mother ordered Phad See Ew expecting authentic or at least tasteful Thai food. I was already in a good mood because of the atmosphere and a good Thai tea. However, you just can't ignore the lack of flavor of both traditional dishes. Both dishes tasted like flavorless jello. I tend to be generous with my opinion on restaurants, but this place just doesn't cut it especially considering the price. You'd be much happier going to the buffet.",

There is no creativity within their dishes, and they add nothing new to Vietnamese and south Asian cuisine, even though they are classified as a Pan-asian restaurant.

They say that you know it's a great Asian restaurant if you actually see Asian patrons in it and trust me, there was a fair number of us out there.

Took our chance and walked over since we were only a party of 2. They got us in right away and the restaurant was mostly empty so don't know why the open table app was booked. Got the pad Thai at 3 spicy. the dish was delicious, will definitely get 4 spicy next time as 3 wasn't as hot. Ordered the mango sticky rice and it was so delicious!! The mango was so sweet and soft! Can't wait to come back!",

When we went inside, they were lot of empty spaces, not sure why it took them so long to allow us inside. Me and my wife ordered cocktails and apetizers. The apetizer we ordered was crispy tofu. We told them to bring cocktails first, but they bought apetizers, since we were really hungry, i had 2 peices and my wife had one piece. The taste was weird, the waiter was in the next table, we waited for him, we called him, the moment he looked our apetizer, he told it was seafood. At this point, i was really pissed off. The worst part was that he was totally unapologetic. I just lost my apetite for eating.  He was so casual as if its not a big thing, i beieve he was sure his restaurant is not going to be affected by people like me as there were lot of customers for them.  Ordered Vegetarian yellow currry and Fried rice. Yellow curry was really delicious but fried rice was really bland. Ordinary white rice would have worked here. The food quality was below average baring the yellow curry.",

The pho meat was dry (despite being in SOUP) while the broth was lukewarm and bland. Terrible terrible terrible.   The curry crab was pisspoor, using spice to cover up its utter lack of scrumptious taste. Clearly, the chef has never been to south east asia because the curry crab just tastes like salt and peppers. Word to the wise: when restaurants have zero flavor they over burden the food with salt. Lemongrass is one of these restaurants.   Avoid it unless its absolutely the last last last choice in the world. Unless of course you like terrible food.",

I had the 4 course specials for $30 and it includes satay appetizer, soup, choice of entree and mango sorbet dessert. I was pretty happy that they were able to change the beef satay to shrimp with only mininal increases in price. I ordered the noodle entree and the portion was huge. The mango sorbet was a nice refreshing dessert at the end.   The only thing I did not like was the tom yum soup with mushroom. It was extremely spicey (even for someone very used to spicey food). I had to drink a full glass of cold water in order to wash down half a bowl of soup.   Other than that, I was pretty happy with my meal.",

I love thai food, especially pad Thai and their version is bland and boring.  The yellow chicken curry is $18 and doesn't even come with rice. I can't imagine enjoying curry without rice so I shelled out the extra $3 bringing my curry dish to $21.  Dinner for 4 (without alcoholic beverages) was $120.  We each ordered 1 entree and split an appetizer for the table.  You can drive 10 minutes in any direction off the strip and get food that is 10 times better for literally 1/3 of the price.  The ambiance of the restaurant is ok. It is located in a quiet corner off the casino floor next to the high limit area. There is not a lot of people watching but t is a perfect spot if you want a quiet dinner or lunch.  The staff is ehh. No one is over friendly but they aren't rude either.  I have been a few times and we almost always have to wave down out server to let them know we are ready to pay.  To sum it up only go here for convenience.  If you are staying at the Aria or close by and don't feel like venturing outside of the hotel. Food is overpriced and bland but I did eat it.",

A few salads and dumplings started us off, then followed by the winner - hot and sour seafood soup.

I often eat Thai food including northern and southern CA, New York, Canada, London, Paris and of course Thailand so I know a bit about Thai food.

We went here at 12:30am right after the New Year's Eve fireworks show on the Strip.  We had the spicy cucumber as an app.  It was really good and tasted like authentic Korean Kim Chee with sesame oil added to it.    The Red Curry with Beef was really good and tasted well when paired with the sticky rice.  But the Sampan Crab is the start of the night as it is every night.  This is by far the best Crab I have ever eaten in my life.  For $68 you get the head and a bunch of claws, arms, legs, body, etc.  The portion is so HUGE!    The crab is moist and delicate.  The breadcrumbs mixed with the peppers and gaclic just work.  You can scrape it off the shell and eat it.  Then work your way into the flesh and the combination has to be one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life.  The order easily feeds 2 people.  I would highly recommend that anyone in Vegas go down here and eat this dish.  Just make sure you save some for me when I go back again.",

We were staying at the Vdara and decided to walk across the way to Aria to see their restaurants and we decided to eat at Lemongrass.   We were immediately seated but the service got off to a slow start.   We sat at the table for almost 15 minutes before we were offered something to drink. I asked for water and he asked for beer (one the was on tap but I can't remember). It took almost 10 minutes for our drink orders and we placed our order once the drinks were brought to the table out of fear of the waitress disappearing and not returning.   This restaurant is very versatile and can accommodate groups, children or date nights if the service is up to par.   We ordered the spicy prawns and spicy Asian cucumbers for our appetizer. My husband ordered sesame chicken for his entree and I had the pla lobster salad.   The appetizers arrived fairly quickly and to our surprise the prawns were actually flattened a bit so that they can be rounded and looked like a panko coated crab cake. The prawns while a little different were absolutely delicious as was the rest of he food and the portions were fairly large.   There was celery in the salad that I had ordered and I was picking it out as I am not a big fan of celery. The waitress asked if my food was okay and I told her that it was very good and my husband chimed in that I was picking out the celery because I don't really like it.   The waitress offered to take my salad back an remake it without the celery which was very nice but I told her that it was no problem and that I would eat the salad that I was served. She seemed a bit concerned that I may not enjoy my meal and asked if I was sure and when I assured her that it was okay she left.   The waitress came back to the table about 10 minutes later and asked if I was ok again and if I was enjoying my salad and once again I assured her that the salad was delicious. I did appreciate her concern.   As we were eating another waitress was pushing a cart containing dim sum thru the dinning room. The food on the cart looked and smelled delicious but we didn't order any because we knew were not going to able to eat all of the food we had ordered.   The prices are a little steep especially since or bill was over $50 for lunch but hell we were in Vegas!",

    "text": "Delicious! We were staying at Vdara and found this place walking around Aria and decided to make a reservation. We went with a large group and I think everyone liked their food. I ordered yellow curry and some wine, and both were tasty. For dessert we ordered the mango sticky rice, fried banana, and something with coconut (I can't remember what it was). All of those were awesome. The prices were also decent--I think my meal was ~$15 or so, but they had more expensive/fancy entrees if that's what you're into. The service was also super friendly and fast. We waited the perfect amount for our food--not too short (where you feel rushed and wonder if they even cooked your food) but not too long. Our waiter Chun was great. I'd definitely love to go here again, especially because I always get cravings for Thai food. It's good to know next time I get a craving in Vegas.",

    "text": "Visited here on a Sunday night right before the Cirque Du Soleil show upstairs (which was terrific!). The restaurant was not busy at all, so the reservation I made proved pointless. The decor was nice, but I didn't expect anything else from an establishment inside the Aria. My friend and I were very thirsty and the best thing about the staff was that they kept our waters filled the entire time! That was huge for us, and brought us back to life at the end of a long weekend in Vegas. We got the Salmon Spring Rolls as an appetizer and I am very glad we did. These were excellent! I had the Singapore Noodle as a main dish and this was also very good and sized appropriately for the price. I was a little worried that it wouldn't be enough food given how hungry I was, but everything worked out fine. At the end, I paid under $40 for an appetizer and main dish along with generous tip. I thought this was pretty good for Vegas, and the food quality was above average. I would go back if I was in the Aria, but it is a bit out of the way if you are just strolling the Strip since the restaurant is tucked in the back of the Casino. The dessert options here were poor, but do yourself a favor and visit the Gelato spot just down the hall, Jean Phillippe Patisserie. $5 will satisfy your sweet tooth with a generous cup of your flavor choosing!",

Service is also v. good -- with folks coming in to check up on diners at regular intervals.  But, no amount of service and decor can make up for so-so food.... Now, I can try to blame it on one of my dining companions, who insisted that the spice factor for all the dishes be a 1 on scale of 10.... but, non-spicy food can still have flavor.  While the salmon spring rolls had a nice crisp to them, throughout the rest of the meal (which included shrimp fried rice, steamed cod, cashew chicken and tiger prawns), I kept thinking: this is dressed up Panda Express.... in a tuxedo.  Seriously. Entrees at over $25 for sub-par food?? Nope.  Never again.  Hopefully, food gets better soon...",

I ordered the roasted duck and bbq pork noodles, and I was very disappointed. the only thing good about it was the pork. the duck had too many bones and barely any meat, the soup was very oily and lacked flavor, the vegtables weren't cooked all the way, and neither were the noodles. my dad ordered pad thai. he told them no peanuts but they still put some on the plate. the server was nice enough to go fix that. other than that, my dad said the pad thai was okay, nothing special.  I decided to give the place another chance. I ordered pad kee mao spicy 4/10. I'm not sure how they measure their spicy level, but I did say 4/10, which shouldn't be all that spicy.. but it was. I couldn't enjoy it because my tongue was burning. but there was so much wrong with this, I don't even.. ok, so aside from the spiciness, the meat and especially the vegtables were inconsistently cut. majority of the pieces were very big as well as very undercooked. another thing was that the noodles were hardly seperated; most of the noodles were still stuck together. lastly, there was so much basil.. again, aside from it being not cooked properly, there was so much that I had it in every bite, it was overpowering. that being said, I would not come here again, and I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. it's just bad food for an expensive price.",

    "text": "I would consider this Westernized Thai and would not have selected to eat here but.. 1. It was our first night in Vegas 2. It was getting late 3. We were all hungry 4. We needed a place to round up the troops 5. We had to get ready and head out to the club ASAP  eating just before 10pm, the place was still pretty packed and we waited for about 15 minutes before a table for 15 opened up. The waitress who seemed very nice in the beginning eventually became more grumpy throughout the night.  A variety of dishes were ordered to share, family style. Between my few friends who opted for this suggestion, we got a singapore style noodle with peppers, shrimp and the works. It was tasty, good filling and nice fusion-like flavours. To try something different, we got a chicken hot pot, which was cooked beautifully. It had spice and kick to it, while the chicken was saucy and tender. Piping hot, this was my favourite. A staple dish that I use to order when available was pineapple fried rice. Usually at the \"hole in the walls,\" the rice was actually served in a half of a pineapple and little bits can be scraped out at the end. However, this was just served on a plate and the worse pineapple fried rice I've ever tasted - no joke. The rice was dry and burnt. There was lack of flavours and just hard to eat. I tried to consume more of the other dishes to satisfy my hunger instead.  The prices seemed reasonable, with some lobster delicacies as high as $110. Not sure if it would be worth it.",

(Today is Sunday, so I am not sure if dim sum is available on just Sundays, on both Saturday and Sunday, or every day).  The staff is very attentive and friendly.  The suggestions our waitress recommended were on point.  Well, except for the papaya salad, which lacked the kick that most papaya salads have.  Barely tasted the fish sauce or lime in it.     Loved the sea bass, the marinated fried squid.  If you're in the Aria and you're craving Asian / Thai'ish (yes, I said \"ish\") food, Lemongrass is definitely worth checking out.  Pricing is also reasonable.  My party of 3 ate 4 selections of dim sum, sea bass, marinated fried squid, papaya salad, brown rice, and we also drank 2 Thai teas and 1 fresh-cocunut juice for a total of $103 pre-tip.  More importantly, we were FULL AND SATISFIED.  Worth coming back to try out more of what their menu offers.",

First off, the Aria on its own is a beautiful casino and a great alternative on the North Side of the strip as opposed to the rundown hustle and bustle of Freemont Street hotels.  Secondly, the Lemongrass restaurant was probably the best Thai Food I ever had.  I ordered a level 7, which was at the time I mistake.  But the curry was so good that I kept eating it, mouth burning, and a Sapporo to wash it down, that by the time I realized I was too full to eat anymore, I couldn't stop shoveling it in my mouth!  Yes.  Shoveling.  I'm not the kind of girl you can take to eat in public.  lol.  The server was friendly and he got all of our orders perfectly correct.  The kinds of places I usually eat, one has to worry about that kind of thing often in a big group.  The total bill was something like $250, for the seven of us.  We all ordered an entree and a beverage or two.  Because it was our friend's birthday, she got any drinks she ordered comp'd.  That was nice of the waiter!  I can picture myself eating here again next time Vegas calls my name.  Heck, I could even picture myself staying at the Aria.",

Snag yourself a booth and admire the decor that might just be unlike anything you've ever seen before.  If you're a little unsure of what to order or a first-timer, you can't go wrong with the Sweet and Sour Chicken.  It's classic, but so good that you'll finish the entire dish in one sitting.  It's tangy and sweet, breaded, and dashed with a little pineapple, bell pepper, and onion.  Do yourself a favor and dine out there more than once!",

We had passed this place a couple of times while roaming around Aria so we decided to give it a try.     We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with Seafood (spice level 4) and my compatriot ordered the Basil Meat with Shrimp (spice level 5) with jasmine rice. The food here is meant to share as medium sized plates are already on the table and they the meals/food ordered is brought in larger plates. I have never had drunken noodles before so I cannot compare it to other dishes I've had, but it was delicious. The noodles were the right thickness to absorb the delicious sauce and there was an ample amount of seafood (4 medium sized scallops, 4 shrimp, and 3 pieces of calamari). The basil meat with shrimp was fresh and had good flavor to it. We also ordered extra spice on the side so that we could control the spice level (can order level 1-10), but we did not add any additional spice to our meal beyond the level that we ordered.     I would definitely come back again to Lemongrass to try the other dishes on the menu as this visit was a delicious hit.",

We waited over 10 minutes for our server, Cheng, to come to our table. While he was pleasant, he seemed a little shy and disappeared for most of our meal. The menu wasn't explained to us, nor did he help at all in making suggestions. He was only there to take our drink and food order and drop off dessert at the end. Also, we could barely hear his quiet voice. I appreciated all of the other bussers refilling our water glasses and picking up our finished plates, however.  The food was delicious! The grilled pork neck was the highlight of our meal. Very tender and flavorful. Also, the iceberg dessert was very unique. I loved the corn and rose water flavor, it was delicious.   I don't think I would come back. Service is part of a dining experience, and tonight's service left me feeling frustrated. But two stars for ambience and food.",

First off the hostess seats us at a dirty table with literally sticky sauce she clearly sees and proceeds to let me clean it because moving us to one of the 25 empty tables is too much to ask. Oh but she did offer me an extra napkin since I had to use mine to clean the table. The restaurant was maybe 1/3 full but the waitstaff was MIA for some time when a young man came to our table and told us our waitress was busy so he can take our order.  Once he took our order it was quite some time before we got our drinks, just a soda but flat. The next time we saw him we told him the sofa was flat and he offered to get us something else but I asked if they could just replace the co2 but he literally said no. Ok fine.  Then it took about another 20 minutes to get our appetizers and even longer for our meal.   The food... eh. Very lacking in flavor and I would not recommend eating chicken since both things we ordered had a very rubbery weird version of chicken.   I would not recommend this place at all.  We paid about $90 for 2 dishes and 2 appetizers. Waste of money.",

Men lie, women lie, taste buds don't.   If you're thinking of patronizing Lemongrass in the Aria hotel and casino, I would recommend you don't unless your hobby is throwing away money.   To the Aria hotel and casino: why do you allow this subpar restaurant to be on the premises of your business and bring down your reputation? I've tried several of the restaurants at your hotel /casino and they've all been at an acceptable level of excellence, besides of course Lemongrass. (And the stay at your hotel has been solid and I've had fun at the tables and slot machines there too.) Perhaps it would be wise to tell the owner /management of this restaurant to shape up or ship out, in my opinion. Lemongrass is the bad apple at the Aria.",

After we checked out the menu, we found half of dishes were served Asian food (Chinese or Northern Chinese food) rather than Thai food.  I ordered green curry chicken and it tasted good. The chicken was tender and green curry sauce quite creamy but taste light not spicy at all. Honestly, most of Thai restaurants in Vancouver can make this simple dish.  My gal friend had beef brisket noodles and just average! The beef brisket a bit dry and chewy and the noodles were soft. Of coz, we were not expect any Asian food wouldn't be better in Vancouver or in Hong Kong.  Anyway, prices were reasonable for the quality and amount of food served.

    "text": "Lemongrass has beautiful decor and is nicely situated amidst the Aria Hotel directly near the Sky Suites entrance. The restaurant is actually tastefully done with a central bar and plenty of tables. The food itself is nothing short of average, it isn't terrible but it is by no means terrific. The Satay is essentially the best thing on the menu and you have your choice of meat, I've had the lobster and the beef, both were pretty good. The Phad See Ew with pork wasn't anything to write home about and the overall portion/presentation is simply just average as well. I will say that the Thai ice tea is pretty tasty... The servers were stretched a bit too thin which ultimately resulted in subpar service. Overall, this place is nothing spectacular but if you're wanting late night Thai and want to stay in the vicinity of Cosmo and Aria, then give it a shot.   Pros- Nice ambiance  Location Decor  Thai ice tea  Satay   Cons- Food was average  Service was meh  Portions a bit small  Pricey for what you get",

However, I sat at the bar and had a poor experience with the staff and food. The bartender was busy, but didn't stop to take my full order... He would stop and listen to a word then run away. He forgot or didn't hear my drink order even though I asked several times. When I was able to order I got the drunken seafood noodles and found it to be dry and flavorless (disclaimer, 4/10 spice). Steamed BBQ buns are not to be missed though.",

First off, it's never easy to find a restaurant that tries to incorporate many types of Asian food, and have all the dishes tasting good at the same time.  But this place definitely is an exception.  I can honestly say that I haven't had a bad dish here.  Of course, the dishes are more catered to \"mainstream\" customers, but the sauces and flavors are very on point!  Many places serve sweet & sour shrimp and sesame chicken....but very few of them get it right.  This place definitely gets it right!  Regardless of how \"authentic\" places may be or not, good food is still good food!  As always, my opinion is simply that.  Make sure to try for yourself.  Some recommendations:  - ribeye steak w/tamarind sauce - sweet & sour chicken/shrimp - sesame chicken - green seafood curry - papaya salad",

Not too impressed with the depreciating quality over the years or the decor compared to blossom next door but the pad Thai and satay are still good. As for the chicken and flounder- go to blossom for those.   I suggest here for lunch or afternoon dining- not dinner.",

    "text": "Looked on Yelp for a fun spot for a Saturday night dinner in Vegas and stumbled upon this place. The menu looked great, so I booked some reservations.  We arrived on time for our reservation and were immediately seated.   I decided to order a bit of sake, admittedly not knowing much about sake. I decided to go with one of the cheaper options listed under \"bottled sake.\" I was always lead to believe that sake was meant to be served warm, usually out of a bottle. What did I receive? A can of ice cold sake. Yes it may have been my fault for not fully understanding the sake concept, but it shouldn't be listed under the \"bottled\" options.  That tangent aside, we browsed over the menu that had many intriguing items on it. Pineapple fried rice, bbq pork rice and the many curry options jumped out to me. I went with the red curry and a bbq pork rice.  After our order, the service plummeted down hill, many times sitting for quite a while with empty water glasses.  Upon receipt of food, I was pleasantly surprised by the curry portion size. The red curry was very flavorful with a bit of a zing from spice.  The bbq pork fried rice was good, but disappointing for the price.  Upon finishing our plates, we sat, and sat, and sat, waiting for our server to come by so we could ask for the bill... nothing.  Overall, service dragged this rating down. The food was generally solid for the price point. If you are looking for Thai food, you can take your chances here, or look at the many food options elsewhere in Vegas.",

I almost didn't come here because of the somewhat bad reviews but I decided to give it a shot since I was staying at the sky suites and it's literally downstairs by the elevators.   I sat down with low expectations and I was shocked. I ordered the pad Thai, basil beef and Tom yum soup. The service was good as well, everyone is really nice and my waitress accidentally ordered me the wrong soup but was really sweet about it and made sure my order was correct.   Pad Thai 5/5. It was really flavorful and had a really great taste to it. It wasn't dry and it wasn't just a plain red/orange sauce they for sure added a lot to it but in a good way. I can't really explain it but it was really good.   Basil beef 4/5. I enjoyed this, it was really tender and flavorful. I've had better but still amazing.   Tom yum soul 4/5. I don't like the mushrooms they use. They're really big I like the traditional small mushrooms, but overall the flavor and spice was there. I ordered spice level 4 on everything and it had a good kick to it and I like spicy.   So cool that it's open until 2AM. I'm definitely going there for a late night bite.",

The interior is beautiful but I did not find the couch booths that comfortable. Waiters were attentive and nice. Food presentation was pretty nice but overall it was so-so. I enjoyed the Tom yum soup and the chicken skewers with that peanut sauce. YUM! I was looking forward to their spicy cucumber appetizer dish but that was so-so as well as their pad thai.

The service is great, quick and friendly. OMG they have THE BEST sesame chicken seriously!! I strongly suggest the dish as one of your choices. The cucumber salad was bland, the fried rice was ok, the noodles were very thai-ish; the restaurant is an Asian fusion type of place that is very chic with dim lights and great ambiance. The price is $$-$$$ and the drinks are expensive in my opinion but that's Vegas. Over all the place was bomb diggity and I totally recommend it, especially that sesame chicken!",

They did make him another plate but we thought for sure because of the disgust from the hair and having to wait for another plate, that the restaurant would at least comp us his meal. We were charged full price for it. They could have at least comped half for the trouble/the fact that both of us were grossed out. We felt like they should have done more than just apologize/remake the meal.",

I've been to many Thai restaurant for some reason they are all different, the way they cooked and flavor each dish. This place is on the mild version (not in a bad way). I had fresh coconut, chicken satay and green curry. I say it's pretty good and tasty and the service is fast too. Well I came here before everybody else and it's very quiet.  Although I think it's a bit pricey but generous in portions, knowing that there are so many Thai restaurants who offer cheaper prices and may be a bit better (taste wise). I've been in Thailand and yes I've had authentic Thai food. I'm just saying",

We had no clue what would be open but to my surprise there was a spot called LemonGrass open in the Aria hotel.   We headed over there and sure enough it was like midnight at they were open till 1-2AM and still were doing tasting menus. We were quite toasty at this point however they served us. They also don't think had any idea what \"gluten-free\" meant since our waiter didn't even speak English. Which in the food industry hey, It could be a good thing! The food was excellent, the drinks were tasty and overall I'd go back to LemonGrass, especially for being open late night.",

They sat us right away without a reservation which was nice. We got ice waters and my bff got a watermelon caipiro (vodka based). The cocktail was delicious and you could barely taste the vodka because the watermelon juice was so flavorful and delicious.   We started with the potstickers app. They were delicious. 6 pieces Steamed soft in the middle and then fried to a light brown crispy texture - perfect and delightful.   I ordered the beef brisket egg noodle soup and my bff got the pad Thai with vegetables. This is where the evening took a dive.    The egg noodles were super thin and bunched up. I had to fight them to get them to seperate so I could eat them.  They were totally flavorless and bland.  The beef brisket came in as cubes of tough meat that was hard to chew and had fatty sides on each piece that I had to try to peel the meat away from to eat. The broth was flavorful and there were Baby bok choy pieces that were plain but yummy.  I stopped eating about halfway through - just couldn't keep fighting the dish with the huddled up noodles and tough meat squares.   The pad Thai was spicy and flavorful. It came with raw bean sprouts, a slice of lime, peanuts, and the veggie option had huge pieces of veggies - big slices of carrots, Asian corn, asparagus, mushrooms. There were way more veggies than noodles and they were cut into such big chunks that it overwhelmed the skinny noodles.   The entrees were a total bummer. However the cocktail and appetizer were very good.",

We ordered the chicken satay grilled sticks to start and it came with a delicious peanut sauce, bread, and pickled peppers and cucumbers. Very delicious!  Next, we had the chicken Penang curry (yes, despite the menu confusion, you can order it with chicken). We wanted it to be medium spicy so ordered the 3 per our waiter's (Pei) suggestion but it was not spicy at all (probably because it's sweet). But it was very delicious and the curry was creamy and perfect.  We also got the Thai Basil Chicken which was overall good but not as great as the curry. If you love basil though, it is very strong on the basil taste along with the satay chicken.  Lots of chicken too!  We ordered sides of brown rice (You have to order as extra) which was average.  Overall, a good experience, lots of good food, and good service by Pei. Thank you! We would go back.",

I arrived 115-120 am and host offered a table but since I was alone I requested the bar to which the bartender says we stopped serving here I can place order but it will come in a box to go and no problem if you want to eat it here! My jaw dropped I immediately requested the manager she stated we stop serving at 130 is 129. She adds we will serve you this time.  Yes please because it wasn't 130 and I won't be returning. Change the closing time! Because 130 is not 2 am original closing time and tasteless noodles don't take 30 minutes to prep!",

    "text": "I dined at Lemongrass with my vegan husband and a friend of ours on a Tuesday evening. We arrived around 6 pm, did not have reservations and did not have a wait to be seated.  The ambiance was lovely, as expected from a restaurant within the Aria. We were seated at a comfortable table that allowed us to converse easily while we dined. I have absolutely zero complaints about the service, the staff was efficent and amicable.   Of the items ordered, Tom Kha soup with lobster was my favorite dish. $24 got us serving that was large enough for 2 to share, with great flavor and huge chunks of lobster. The Phad Thai was average at best. I would recommend passing on this dish.  The serving size for the chicken Larb was a bit small but it was minty and delicious.  I did not eat any of the Panang Curry, but my husband enjoyed it. A bit of a bummer that rice is an additional $3 for this dish, but overall I found the pricing fair for the items we ordered considering we were eating at one of the higher end resorts on the Strip.  Mango sticky rice for dessert was the perfect way to end our meal.   I left stuffed and happy. As a local, I have a few Thai restaurants located off-Strip that I would choose to go to over Lemongrass, but for on-Strip dining I would return here.  Yelp Reviews 2018 36/100",

I love variety.  This place is located inside of the Aria Hotel and Casino. Across from Blossom.   The inside was nice. Vibe was pretty good, not super romantic. We were able to get our own side table which was big enough for all of the food we were about to order!  Service was was bad. Our server took forever to come and check on us. We had to grab different waiters throughout the entire dinner to ask or get things. Also, it took forever for us to get our food. Even just the appetizers.  As for the food - We ordered pretty much everything they had to offer:  Seaweed salad - Huge portion. Very good.  Assorted Dim Sum - Good. I've had better  Chicken Green Curry - Really good. Good portion  Duck Panang Curry - Really Good! Lot of duck.  Sticky Rice - Very good  Seafood Drunken Noodles - it was ok, I've had better  Pork Pad See Ewe - We asked for Chicken...they still gave us pork. Dish was still good.  Chicken Pad Thai - Huge portion. Had all the ingredients to me awesome. I don't this it had enough spice.  Sweet and Sour Chicken - Very good  Sesame Chicken - Very good!  Pineapple Fried Rice - Very good! Huge portion  Overall - very good. Huge portion on food. Love the variety of dishes. Nothing blew me out of the water. Service was awful.",

The food here is bland for there is no Thai flavor in it at all but when I'm hungry I'll eat pretty much anything.  One thing that I had ordered was \"Fresh Orange Juice\" which I had them remove because what was served is by far fresh and even in my state I could not drink it.  It was like cheap OJ from your local supermarket.  Anyways I don't have anything good to say about the food here.  Service was good still at that time so that would be the reason why this isn't 1  Update to the comment:  That was only 1 pic which are not what we ordered as a whole.  But I know what good food is because I'm eating it so all reviews are just my opinions.  I appreciate your comments however the food is still not good regardless.  No justification will make it better and you say your chief is from Bangkok...well he needs to go back to school to learn to cook and hire someone that can cook real Thai.  this may come across as mean, however this is the truth and not everyone can handle it.  Best wishes for maybe someone else might like it but your food is not for me.",

We ordered chicken satay skewers, papaya salad, pineapple fried rice, duck panang curry, baby bok choy, sweet and sour chicken, and a tofu dish. Everything tasted good, just as you'd expect but honestly nothing to write home about.   What DID stand out? Our server, Bank. All of us agreed that it was the best service we have ever encountered by a server, ever! And that is saying a lot.   Our curry was on the salty side and he insisted on getting it remade for us even though we told him we were fine with keeping it. Food was coming out really slow because they were short staffed, but Bank continued to check on us and update us.   Three stars for the food, five stars for the service.",

    "text": "We arrived to Vegas in the evening and Lemongrass was one of the few restaurants that is open after 10pm, so we decided to check it out even though we were planning to come back in the morning for dim sum.  Thankfully, there is a good selection of food and our two meals felt like they could have been from two different restaurants.   Lemongrass is a fusion restaurant. I'm usually weary of Asian fusion as I feel it's often a watered down version of what the authentic dishes would be, but Lemongrass does a good job. Is it going to match the country-specific cuisine I can get back in the Bay Area?  No, but it's good enough.   For our first meal we tried the tasting menu. The chicken and seafood skewers were tasty, nothing mind blowing, but a good start. The soup, unlike what I've read from other reviewers, was actually quite good. The seafood and vegetables were fresh, tender, and broth so good I made sure to finish it to the last drop.  For main course, we both had the pad thai.   I understand the criticisms of other reviewers.  There are many variations of pad thai and this one is less flavorful and on the blander side than most. However; the key to the more mellow style is to let the basic ingredients and cooking technique shine, which the chef did quite well.  The freshness and technique made what otherwise would be a zero a hero. I'll admit I usually like a more flavorful sauce, but I enjoyed this dish. The spice level, was a bit higher than I expected though.   We returned the next morning for dim sum. Again, this is a fusion restaurant so I went in expecting that it wouldn't match what I can get back in the Bay.  I agree with other reviewers in that the traditional flavors were not there, but the execution was done well and still tasty.  I enjoyed the twists Lemongrass put on the traditional dishes.   When we went later at night the service was a bit cold, yet still professional. The morning staff was much more friendly and pleasant. I chalked this up to the night staff having to deal with all the party people.   Many reviewers have mentioned the inflated prices here. EVERYTHING in Vegas is expensive, that is just how it is.",

Nearly 10 minutes later a woman appeared with not one drop of interest in her job and seated us.  After waiting 10 minutes and not being waited on, we left.  I politely introduced myself to the manager as we left and I was told, \"So sorry.\"  It's unappetizing when seemingly half the tables in a restaurant have not been cleared of dirty dishes.  Lemongrass wins the award for the most uncleared tables!  Needless to say, I cannot score Lemongrass favorably.",

The entire meal, the waiters were hovering over us and the restaurant was not even close to full. We asked to be moved. The waiter came back and said the hostess told him he couldn't move us because there was nowhere else we could sit. Literally three tables were open the entire time we ate and that's just in view of our seats. There's a whole other half to the restaurant. Made me feel really bitter about the whole experience.

I only have good memories from each of my visits from this place and I highly recommend this place to everyone who is a Thai cuisine lover looking for Thai food in Vegas. The variety of food is good and the portion sizes are huge for the price you are paying, compared to most of the places within the resorts on the strip.  On my first visit, we had the red and green curries with pork and chicken. You get to dictate the spice level in your food from 1-10 and I think 6 is the lucky number if you like it spicy! The flavors were spot on and the quantity was huge and we had to get it packed. On my second trip, we got the dim sum platter with the duck red curry. The dim sums were sooo good and the duck curry was most perfect duck curry I have had so far. As always, the curry was soo much that we went through 2 bowls of rice without even realizing it as it was all so good. I always get the warm satisfying feeling after having food here and the restaurant is right there on the strip as well which is very convenient.  I hope you all visit and have a great time as we did.",

    "text": "I'm definitely a fan!  First of all, you can't beat the hours - they are open until 2AM every night - you just don't see that with a nice restaurant like this. Plus, the food and service are top notch and I feel like the prices are very reasonable.  The restaurant is made to resemble a Thai Silk Factory - it's dimly lit and this might sound weird, but I love the lamps at each table. They specialize in Thai cuisine, but also have quite a few Chinese dishes as well.  When I dined here, I had the yellow curry with chicken. At $16, the portion was HUGE and could definitely be shared. I was disappointed that they charged $3 extra for rice - this is something that usually comes standard with curry. However, for less than $20, I thought it was a great portion and REALLY tasty. I ordered it at a level 5 - their scale is from 1-10 and I was advised that 3 was medium. Although 5 was a bit spicier than I anticipated, I would probably go with at least a 6 next time (for that extra kick).  Overall, it was a great experience - considering I was there just before close (at 1:45AM). The service was prompt and friendly and I was surprised at how busy it was at that time. If you are at Aria and looking for something a little different (this is the only Thai restaurant on the Strip I believe), definitely check out Lemongrass!",

A lot if restaurants closed before 12AM, this was one that was open late and still served a full menu after hours so we decided to try it.   FOOD: Chow Mein (3.5 stars): Regular noodles, good, but nothing special.   Prawn satay (5 stars): Cooked perfectly! I'd recommend this if you like prawns.   Yellow curry (4 stars): Needs more chicken. Broth was still good though.   Sake: They only have it warm here, wasn't used to that. I like cold better.   SERVICE (4 stars): Everyone was nice but the waiter would disappear at times.  ATMOSPHERE (5 stars): Nice decor, spacious, clean.",

We started with potstickers which were good, but nothing special.   We decided to try out a couple of soups, the wonton noodle soup and a duck and BBQ beef soup. They were just terrible. They tasted like mop water. Our server did not drop them off and never returned to check on us or refill our waters. We finally flagged him down to get our check. He saw our uneaten meals and asked if we wanted to-go boxes. We told him no and he said okay and went to get the check. He never asked if we liked the food or why we didn't eat more of it.  I'm sure there are other options that we would have enjoyed, but we won't be back to try them.",

The Satay skewers are their \"special\" but I really don't think it's worth the $18+ price tag depending on what your choice of meat is.  Another must try is the Crab Omelette, very hearty and comfort food.  I would skip the appetizers like the jellyfish or cumcumber, but I would definitely go for the Fish Cakes.  If you're in the mood for a fried noodle dish, I'd reccommend the Mee Goreng.   The service here is great, but it's kinda pricey for a Thai restaurant.",

Had the tom kah and chicken satay (full marks for their peanut saurce) for appetizers, both really good.   For the Entree, I had the Crab Fried Rice, along with Green Curry, and Black pepper shrimp. I simply loved the fried rice, the crab meat was so tender and juicy.  The black pepper sauce was beautifully done, and the consistency was perfect to be paired with the rice.  For dessert, we shared the Sticky rice with Mango. One word YUMM! Although, in some other places, the sticky rice is black jasmine rice which somehow makes it all the more appealing. Still, this dessert did a good job.   Great value for the price if you're looking for a slightly more reasonable dinner tab.",

The tom kha was pretty fantastic, but the curry was just meh.  I can't really put my finger on it, but it just didn't taste..authentic.  Our main gripe with the restaurant was the service.  It took FOREVER to go get our bill settled.  Our order was literally just the tom kha and panang.  To just ask for the bill, it took over 15 minutes. We put our card in the weird card holder boxes they had, and then....nothing.  At this point our waiter must've been kidnapped or roofied or something because he was nowhere to be seen.  Eventually, the boyfriend had to get up and walk directly to the check stand to drop off our card, just to get someone to process our payment info and get us the heck out of there.  From there, it took another 10 minutes for them to bring us our final receipt and return our card.  This was on a slow Tuesday night when there were maybe three other tables there.      The second time we ate here during our stay, we got our food to go.  This experience was much more positive.  The girl at the front who took our order was super helpful and friendly, and showed us how to charge the food to our MLife account.  This time we got the lobster satay and it was absolutely AMAZING.  The sauce was delicious and fresh, and the lobster was cooked perfectly.  We'd definitely return here just for that, but would probably get it to go just because of the dine-in service deficiencies.  I'd recommend the tom kha and satay here, but I'd definitely advise others to budget the time for the uber slow service.",

However, it was verrrry pricey for basic thai food.  My bf ordered the drunken noodles with seafood for $20 and I ordered some sort of basil chicken rice or something for $15.  After tips and tax, it came out to almost $45 (and to think that a lunch buffet  at bellagio only cost us around the same price, it was a killer).    Not sure if it's because we were both sort of starving, but the food was pretty good.  But with that ticket price, it's only A-OK!",

    "text": "This is very unusual for me to not like a restaurant this much, I swear!  However this was such a disappointment, that it will be some time before I feel the need to go try another restaurant at Aria.  Especially since this the second time dinning there and both places have been mediocre at best. I will take some of the responsibility though, for having a bad experience, because we we're in a rush to get something to eat before Viva Elvis.  I had quickly searched before we left the house just to get an idea of what type of restaurants there was to choose from.  Being that me and my fiance visit Thailand at least once, every year, we really love Thai food.  Therefore, I was excited to try this place, eager to replace my last memory of the English pub that wasn't exactly delicious.   We started off on a bad foot, I admit, by being in such a hurry and it only got worse from there.  I had to basically argue with the waitress on how spicy I wanted my food.  I know I'm a round eye, but what kind of scale goes from 1-10 with 2-3 being medium, huh?  We always order around a level 7 at all our neighborhood Thai places and it comes out perfect.  So after a few minutes of bantering back and forth with the waitress, I finally get to a level 5 on our papaya salad and curry.    When I ordered peppermint hot tea with the food, instead of earlier when she came for the drink order, the look I received spelled trouble.  They served green tea, instead of peppermint, and then it took quite awhile to finally wave someone down so I could get it fixed.  Then the food came out.....Ugh! The papaya salad was seriously the worst I have ever had!  Not spicy at all and seemed to be missing an ingredient.  The curry was also very bland and thank goodness I decided we need some veggies at the last minute because they were really the only good thing we ordered.    The street vendors in Thailand could definitely teach these cooks a thing or two.   Like I said, I hate focusing on the negative, but save your money and go to a small neighborhood Thai place like Jasmine or Archie's, where the food will be authentic and the service friendly!",

I always love the soups and the pad-see-ew. The fried rice was kind of off, as it came covered in this liquidy sauce but we asked the waiters to bring out a new one, prepared more traditionally which was great. However, it was an interesting taste if you would like to try. Our first waiter was a little snobbish which was annoying but the waiter working our table was a delight so that is definitely not a reason to pass up on this amazing restaurant. If you're in the mood for thai food in an elegant setting, I recommend Lemongrass for sure! Hope you enjoy",

    "text": "The menu here was very standard American Thai -- nothing out-of-the-ordinary. You've got your Pad Thai, some various noodle dishes, some soups, a few curries, and so forth. Some were dressed up a bit (lobster in the Tom Yum soup), but it was basically a standard menu.  But it was as fresh and clean and well-prepared as any Thai food I've had. Flavors were right-on. The soup was perfectly balanced (cool + hot). My shrimp were nicely crusted. There was a bit too much syrupy sauce on one tofu stir fry dish for my liking, but that was the only loser.  The restaurant is a little hidden in the Aria, and both times we went there was no wait. The price is about the same as the buffet upstairs (which can have long lines!), but the food is definitely a notch higher.  And, they take the heat ratings seriously here. I asked for mine to be 8/10. I'm usually good with the heat but this was a bit too much! (They warned me, so I can't hold it against them.)",

The tofu in the Pad Siew was too hardened and overpowered the dish. The Pad Siew lacked enough noodles.  The Cashew Chicken lacked flavor.  We had to add generous amounts of chili sauce to both dishes to try and consume both the dishes.  We didn't finish our plates. I was really disappointed considering what we paid.  There aren't many thai options on the strip.  But if you are craving thai I would go off the strip or wait till you return home.  I would never come here again.   There are plenty of other eat around the strip that are well worth the visit.",

I had the lemongrass chicken, the mint basil chicken, the spicy egplant chicken, and the chicken w/ peanut sauce (yes, shared). While the food was good, it was overpriced for Thai cuisine. Considering the hotel it's in, and the town, the price is rediculously cheap. Now, considering it is thai food, the ambiance and presentation were much better than most quality thai restaurants.  If you want a repleneshing meal that is actually good for you while in vegas, scope this place out!",

The Sesame Chicken was pretty good, but tasted more like Sweet & Sour sprinkled with sesame seeds and was a little heavy on the sauce. Not bad - but just not what I would call \"Sesame chicken\". One friend had a vegetarian dish and it was good. The rice doesn't come with the meals so we ordered chicken fried rice to share with the table and it was pretty decent. The chicken, itself, wasn't great but the rice and egg were good. The cashew chicken was the real winner of the table. Generous portion and lots of amazing veggies! It could easily be shared! I wouldn't make a priority of coming to this place again or anything, but if you're staying at The Aria its good food, open late, and reasonably priced compared to other Vegas restaurants.",

We went on a Sunday afternoon, and were surprised to see a list of dumplings on the table. The cart doesn't come around too often, which could be frustrating. From the cart we selected the soup and the spinach and shrimp dumplings. They weren't as piping hot as I might have enjoyed, and the soup dumplings weren't as soupy as your dreams. However, the taste, especially of the shrimp/spinach, was excellent. I would get those again. Plus, the environment is about 5 times nicer than your usual dim sum establishment. We also sampled the chicken wings this time around, and they were surprisingly delicious. Their soft tofu is superb in their curries. They don't take it easy on the spice though, so be careful what you ask for. We also tried the Three Cups Chicken, but for the price and execution, you're better off doubling down on the chicken wings!",

We were staying at the Aria, and Thai is one of my favorite cuisines, so I thought we'd play it safe by eating at Lemongrass.  We started with calamari, one of my favorite foods, and it was chewy, bland, and all around blah. The other appetizer we got was the jellyfish, which is probably the only thing I would recommend--loved the sesame flavor. My entree, the Drunken Noodles, was horrendous. Flavor was bland even though I requested it \"very spicy\" and the seafood was even worse. It seemed like they just cooked it separately and threw it on top, and it wasn't even that fresh. Maybe the Southwest just isn't an Asian food mecca, but I didn't think Central Pennsylvania was either, and I have had much better Thai food back home. This food isn't just Americanized, it's gross, and especially at this price I'd definitely recommend getting your Thai fix elsewhere. To top it off, the service was a little too pushy for my taste...they kept trying to get us to order more! It was creepy!  On that note, I highly recommend the drinks here, and the atmosphere is nice. Next time I'll stick to the bar and jellyfish (well, I don't think there will be a next time actually. Sorry, Lemongrass).",

It was promptly served, a good sized portion, and tastefully flavored. Although it was a bit pricey for pad thai ($18), I understand, given the location.  My second experience was through the delivery service. Our group ordered multiple dishes to be delivered to our SkySuite. I decided upon the Duck Noodle Soup. Given I've had duck noodle soup multiple times before, and had a great experience at the restaurant the night prior, I was extremely excited for my meal! However, after taking the first bite, I realized that might not be the case. The soup was extremely salty. The noodles were very thin and undercooked. There was a good amount of duck, but considering the soup base and noodles were not good, the one good part was not enough to salvage the meal. My friends who got Pho said their meal was amazing, which is odd, considering Pho is not even thai food. I only consumed about 1/3 of my meal, before giving up. Another friend ordered the duck noodle soup and had the same thoughts as me. Definitely a disappointing experience.",

The only thing extraordinary about this place was the peanut sauce that comes with the skewers. It was delicious I loved it and so did everyone I was with! The service is okay, not too attentive and a little aloof but they were busy so it was understandable. The chairs and tables are very awkward the table is low and the booth chairs have low backs so it's an awkward sitting situation.

Seated and took a bit to get the waiter to take our order--we should have left then. Ordered and it was a good 20 min before we got the satay we ordered. Then we waited, and waited, and waited 45 more minutes with no food. Waiter never came to say anything. In the meantime, people were seated all around us, ordered and started getting food. A very large party sat next to us and got their food shortly after we finally got ours. Ordered two dishes, finally got one, and had to ask why it was taking so long. Waiter said they \"made it wrong and had to remake it.\" It was a single dish. 4 tables sat around us and ordered and got food within 10-15 min tops. I don't think it takes an hour to remake a dish. We then tried to get the check figuring it would take awhile--we were right. I watched the waiter walk around, stand near the cash register but not print the bill, then get food and serve the table next to me--a party of 6-before even giving us the check. We had to ask AGAIN for the check--he walked away after serving them and still did not get the check. When we asked why it took so ridiculously long to get food, he had some excuse there was a large order in the kitchen. We asked to see the manager, who we learned was Connie, but after sitting awhile we gave up and left. I would never go back here and wish I grabbed some pizza downstairs. I got better service at the bar.",

I can't remember the names of the dishes but one was a mixed seafood salad that had a nice kick to it and the other was wonton noodle soup.

Situated towards the back of the hotel on the casino level, Lemongrass sits next to the Baccarat room & Blossom restaurant. Lemongrass has a relaxing vibe, both beautiful and modern inside - lots of dark woods, sleek booths, and eye-catching, large lantern lightings.  We ordered the Tom Yam Talay soup to start. Lemongrass ranks spiciness as mild, medium, hot, and very hot. We chose our soup to be medium/hot and it came out very spicy!! We love the heat but wow that soup was difficult to enjoy. Either way, the spicy, creamy broth was filled with all types of delicious seafood & had a great mix of lemongrass and ginger flavors. The abalone mushrooms were so tender and yummy too!  We were not too hungry so we decided to share the Singapore Noodles.  Wow, these servings are large! Surprisingly we weren't asked our desired spice level for this dish, and actually found it a bit bland. While we weren't particularly impressed with the noodles--it wasn't better or worse than your typical Thai hole-in-the-wall spot--the portion size is perfect for big eaters who want to dine at a fancier restaurant without breaking the bank.  Overall Lemongrass ranks at 3.5 stars. We weren't really blown away by the food but the ambiance is very beautiful and cozy.",

Vegas is a tourist destination at the end of the day and service should be front and center every time, for every customer. Lemongrass is kidding itself if they think otherwise.  The food is just average...Thai food is usually good at most places...this is your typical fancy Thai spot that just misses the mark.  The spring rolls are average, the cucumber salad...meh.  The penang curry w/shrimp had a slight kick so was the best thing we ate since it actually had decent flavor. The pad thai was just plain boring.  Wine selection is average...nothing crazy but then again, at a Thai restaurant, can't come in expecting spectacular vino selection.  Please do yourself a favor and skip the nonsense...find a hole in the wall Thai resto off the strip and satisfy your belly and your experience.  Again, the snooty service is the biggest turn off here.",

    "text": "I hate giving this low rating because I really loved the restaurant, but I had the weirdest experience here with my food, and it definitely needs to be addressed.   I ordered the Dungeness Crab Curry dish, one of the most expensive dishes on the menu which I had no problem with...until it was served. The chef very much needs to re-think the way this dish is done because it kind of blows my mind that it was presented the way it was, clearly created for presentation instead of practicality. The waitress, who seemed to be timid and not friendly, served it with nothing that I needed to eat it with. I'll admit it might have been a slight miscomprehension on my part because the description did say whole- but never did I imagine they would serve it with the shell totally intact. This restaurant is a very nice upscale place, so this dish has no business being served inside of the shell- I was going to wear a very nice dry-clean only dress and had changed at the last minute, if I hadn't we would have had a very big problem. I digress...there were no utensils except chopsticks and they had gone as far as to remove the top shell of the crab, gut it, and place it back on top so it has an awesome presentation- but I needed to treat it like an actual crab picking fest including cracking the shell and digging for the meat. Okay, I can deal with that- except they had cooked it with the curry so going through the arduous process of digging the meat out was made MUCH harder because it was now coated in slimy curry. I do not understand how they thought this was practical, by the time I had dug out enough meat everything was cold! Before I commenced with the operation of slaving for my bit of crab meat, I had no idea what to do with it. I thought maybe I could eat it with my chopsticks and sat there poking around for a good 15 minutes when finally the waitress came to check on us and I asked her how I was supposed to eat it. She said \"I'll get you some crackers and a bowl and teach you how to eat it\" I really wish she had explained all of this to me before ordering because I would never have spent the money on this otherwise. So she comes back with two extra bowls (one for the shells and one for the final assembly) and tells me that once I'm done cracking it open, I put the meat in the bowl with some of the steamed rice and scoop the rest of the curry dish into it and eat it that way. I mean WTF! Firstly, why present it that way at all? Why not cook the crab separately then remove the meat, put it in with the curry dish, and do your cute little presentation with the top crab shell so that people don't have to get incredibly messy and take forever to eat a simple dish at an extremely nice upscale restaurant?! Please explain how any of that makes sense.  Aside from all that ridiculousness, the shrimp appetizer dish we had was very good. My husband ordered fried squid and I didn't like it all but the duck sauce it came with was much better with the shrimp thingy. My husband didn't seem overly wowed by his dish choice of drunken noodles but didn't dislike it either. There were a lot of other dishes I was interested in and I wish I had just sucked up my pride and asked for my dish to be taken back once seeing how stupidly involved it was. This was our last dinner of the trip and I gave up trying other places I wanted to go to because the menu here sounded good, but this stupid dish ruined it the night. I hated that I was so absolutely messy and the curry stained my nails and fingers, nothing I did took away the greenish yellow tinge and smell until I got home and had my nails redone.",

My uncle reserved the private room for my family to celebrate my mom's birthday, and he preordered the food ahead of time so I don't know what everything was called.   He also ordered way too much food, not knowing what the portions would be like, which are decent-sized. We had pad thai, some sort go orange chicken, tilapia, fried rice, etc, but the two that stood out to me were the crab cake/pancake (my little brother is annoyingly picky, but he loved this dish) and the seafood curry (nice spices, and it was different from everything else I've tasted).   I also ordered one of their specialty drinks, the Berry Botanical, which was a green tea infused gin with whole blueberries. It was really refreshing, and they were not stingy with the alcohol, which I appreciate.   The ambience is what you would expect of Vegas, trendy, clean and modern with dim, mood lighting. The service was great. My family didn't like the tiny individual plates they gave us, and our server was more than happy to replace them with bigger plates.",

While the food was decent, the service was awful. They were quick to bring out food and that was it. No one came to ask if everything was good and if I needed anything else. That's the bare minimum a restaurant/waiter can do. Had to ask someone to get my leftovers to go. Had to ask for the check twice. The total came out to be $41+ and paid $50 in cash. Never came back for the change. Had to ask them for it. There's no way I was going to leave $8+ tip for such a dismal service.   In a city where they get tons of tourists who probably don't tip and will never see again, I suppose it's ok to have subpar service. If that's your cup of tea, feel free to patron Lemongrass.",

I must say, however, that our visit this past weekend, 12:10 am early Sunday morning, was a bit off.  My wife ordered the Drunken Noodle, a dish she orders at practically every Thai restaurant we go to, and the noodles were, let's say \"different\".  They were chopped up rather than the usual long strands and they looked like they had been sitting a while.  BUT more importantly, the dish was room temperature!  Not something you'd expect with seafood.  I asked our waiter to send it back; however, when he returned with a plate, the dish did not appear to be fresh and it was initially hot but cooled off quickly.  So, clearly it was not a fresh order and it appeared as if it was placed in a microwave since it didn't retain its heat.  Well, needless to say, this wasn't the best experience we've had at Lemongrass, as it's usually VERY good.  Not sure what happened this time around but for those interested, I'd certainly give this restaurant a try.",

    "text": "We ended up here after my boyfriend's father was craving Asian & we wanted something on the cheaper end of Vegas dining. We also love Thai food and are frequent patrons of Thai restaurants. This place still is Strip-priced, (expect $16+ for fried rice or chow mein), but was decent for where we were.  The atmosphere is nice with dark booths and dim lighting. The service was friendly, but were not as attentive as I would have liked.   I ordered the vegetarian pad see-ew, which comes with flat rice noodles, broccoli, egg, & tofu. Simple. It also had a green leaf next to it on the menu indicating one of the vegetarian options- which I loved and appreciated. Regardless, when I got my meal (& I was so ravenous I just dug in), my 1st bite was a mix of white tofu & white CHICKEN!!! UGH!!! Manners & impressing the boyfriend's parents pushed aside, I immediately spit up the contents in my napkin. I have been a vegetarian for 17 years now, that was absolutely disgusting & such an inappropriate mistake for a restaurant to make. Also, why on earth would the kitchen staff put in two proteins?! They clearly charge you double for adding extra protein, & this was one of the specially marked vegetarian entrees. Normally I inspect my meals just in case, but I was just so hungry & trusting... It took a long time to get someone's attention to make it right, & they had to remake my dish while I sat there hungry watching everyone else eat. We were also in a hurry that night as we had after dinner plans. When I finally got my new dish, it had no meat, but it was much drier than the original dish. It also did not taste Thai, or like pad see ew, it was like regular Chinese chow fun. Very disappointing.   The other people in our party ordered the basil beef fried rice, shrimp curry, beef chow fun, & chicken curry, & each enjoyed their meals. I would still recommend this place if you are craving Asian cuisine in Vegas, but beware, vegetarians!",

    "text": "I loved everything about this restaurant. It serves a full menu after 11 pm. The service was great; my water glass was never more than half empty before it was refilled. I ordered prawn satay which had a delicious peanut sauce and duck panag curry. We ordered our food medium spicy and it was spicy but not overly so. The duck was perfectly tender mixed well with all the flavors in the dish. The portions were very large so I recommend sharing an entree if you aren't too hungry.",

    "text": "Lemongrass is located inside Aria hotel right next to blossom. I came here for lunch two days ago with a party of about 10. The service was awful. When we sat down, there was no waiter to be found anywhere near by. I kept having to turn my head back and forth just so I can wave one down. I had to walk to the hostess stand to ask for some menu's to look at. By the time the waiter came, we were ready to order.   I ordered the thai tea as my beverage. It took almost 10 minutes to come out. The thai tea wasn't sweet enough. I've had better.   My boyfriend & I shared the jellyfish and the Lemongrass prawns as the appetizers. I don't recommend the jellyfish. It was too largely cut that it was so hard to chew. I wish it was thinly sliced. So the \"Lemongrass prawns\" came out. And it looks like a fishcake or something. So I asked the waiter what it was and he said fish cake. I told him we didn't order that and that was ordered prawns. So he added that in as well. Then the \"prawns\" came out and it was an eggroll prawn. There was 3 different waiters at this table and they were all saying different things. Finally we verified that it was the Lemongrass prawn and just turn into a mousse. The Lemongrass Prawns was actually pretty decent. It was just a hassle to figure out what everything was.   As our entree we ordered the drunken noodles with seafood. It was okay. The portion was kind of small. There wasn't enough flat noodles. It was about $20 for this dish.   I thought this restaurant was pretty pricey for an \"Asian\" restaurant. And it wasn't even satisfying.",

    "text": "I loved it! Service was excellent, food even better! I got noodles that were out of this world with flavor, never had better to this day. Also tried my friends meal which was some kind of spicy beef that also rocked! And good god, for dessert I tried the coconut soup, yes for dessert you heard me right haha. I can't say it was like a broth because it was way creamy, it is served warm and is supposed to cleanse your palate before you eat a \"real dessert\" as my fiance would say (which I'm not gonna lie,I ate most of his fried bananas too). Just typing this makes me want that soup sooooo bad! I can't describe how yummy it is. Also side note- fried bananas were terrific as well, they use plantain and are the best I have tried so far, great sauce on it and a ton of ice cream is put on the side of it.  You can even order a coconut with the milk in it to drink out of! Will be back...  And soon, cuz now I want that soup!",

Its thai food with a bit of a twist... honestly, it all tasted great but a little sweet. besides the wings being a bit dry:  The panang was awesome. Shrimps (any dish) were great, nice size.  Satay was good along with their Peanut sauce!! Noodles were good Service was good as well...  Thai iced tea, not to sweet, was good!  All together the good and everything was good, no complaints, would go here again.",

The design and decor was nice ( what did you expect, it is inside of Aria )   I started with some hot and sour soup which was great. Everyone ordered the satay grill and some chicken wings were ok. I had the basil meat with chicken and asked for level 10 Thai hot. Let me tell you this, it wasn't even a level 5 on a USA hot scale. The dish had flavor but I've had better. Service was very good. All around decent spot to eat, but for 40$ for a basic Thai meal, I can do WAY better. Probably wouldn't come back unless I am staying at Aria.",

Their reason was that the got some walk-ins that they did not registered on their computer system so their reservation program allowed us to book the reservation.  WT!!!  Who's fault is it that they hired lazy hostesses who doesn't notate the walk ins in their system.  I doubt that we'll come here in the near future.  Wanted to give zero star for service but yelp doesn't allow it.  Don't know how's the food as our reservation was refused.",

    "text": "This place was okay. I came in to Lemongrass because I had a 7:00 show to Zarkana and we needed a quick fix before we went in.   I really like the decor of the small but intimate restaurant. Very cute design. However, if you end up being seated at the booth, those booth chairs are SUPER uncomfortable to sit at. The booths are shorter so it kind of forces you to sit up straight the entire time. I couldn't relax and rest my back onto it without sitting up straight. I guess that's good for my posture but man, imagine sitting up straight for an entire dinner! Sure would have made my mom happy!!  We ordered a various kinds of food. Green curry, pad see ew, shrimp soup, and cashew chicken. All was good but nothing spectacular. For the prices you're paying, I'd say it's nothing that great you couldn't get at a smaller and cheaper Thai joint.   Like I said, it was okay. I enjoyed my green curry but don't enjoy the price I'm paying for it. Would I come back? Depends. If I'm short on time like last time I'll probably stop by here again, but it's probably not on my go to spots here in Vegas.",

However, dishes that were tasted did not stand out from other Thai restaurants (e.g. pad thai, sweet and sour chicken). Though some of the dishes may not have that \"wow factor,\" there are some that are pretty decadent. I'm talking about their red curry. It's amazingly flavorful immaculate Thai dish. Just make sure to not order it too spicy otherwise you won't get to indulge in its rich flavor. Try out the coconut ice cream. It is sublime.",
