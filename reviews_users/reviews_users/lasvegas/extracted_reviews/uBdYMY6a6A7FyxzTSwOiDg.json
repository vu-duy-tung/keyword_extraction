The first time we ate here it was too hot in June so we endured the incredibly loud environment unable to converse, and vowed to eat when the weather was cooler. Instead we were sent along to try another place, which we did. Try the Craft Kitchen on Eastern, less than 5 minutes away. Same kind of food, accommodating customer service and pleasant environment.",

I had to go inside to remind them that 10 people were still waiting. We ordered, took kinda long, then when we got it, it was considerably colder than I thought it would be.. But that could've been partly due to weather (it was like 50 degrees outside). My husband got the pork belly in green salsa which I tasted and it was delicious, but could've been served hotter. I got the meatless Benedict it was ok. But my fried green tomatoes were red, And it was slightly cold. Coffee was really good, and one of my nieces got the spicy Mexican hot chocolate- it was awesome, but probably not recommended for kids (it's actually a teeny bit spicy). My son got the fruity crepe, and he said was really good but not good for filling you up. Maybe it would've been better experience if we ate inside, they forget about you outside I guess.",

Received my plate by our nice server but nearly threw myself off of the sofa I was sitting on because I was in SHOCK of how small these were. I looked on Yelp beforehand and yall must have zoomed in super close because that was a LIE.  I had to order a plate of french toast afterward (which was good), but seriously? Why wasn't this in the starters menu? How is this considered an entree? I understand that caviar and quail eggs are pricey but this TINY blini? This HINT of smoked salmon? COME ON  The lighting in this restaurant was phenomenal tho! Bright and sunny with the large windows. Great restaurant for snapchatting AND getting slightly ripped off!",

Love that the restaurant is small and accommodating but was still roomy enough for them to fit a high chair for our infant car seat (a super plus!). The wait was not too bad on a Sunday (25 mins-ish) they got us in quickly and had a server over within minutes to take our drink order. The service was quick and she was very sweet.   For drinks I wish I could have tasted one of those delicious mimosas I was drooling over on the menu (they have so many cool options). I ordered the creme brulee latte which was TO DIE FOR, the torched sugar on the top is a great touch and my husband's honeycomb cappuccino was awesome and tasted like honeycomb cereal!   The plates came quickly. I ordered the pork belly green chilli which was very tender and tasty (I think it's a great touch to get mexican food that doesn't taste like the only spice they used was cumin). My husband ordered the strawberry shortcake French toast which is drool worthy, I would go back just for that plate. The Empanadas were a nice appetizer, however they do taste a little doughy (or I guess in this case masudas). Loved mostly everything that I tasted on our plates and it was a pleasant foodie experience no doubt.  Would definitely come back and recommend this place! A great brunch option in the Henderson area!",

Either the reviews are bogus, or the people writing them are clueless.  I had the much touted pork belly Benedict. The pork was dry and covered in BBQ sauce and the eggs looked like they were boiled in fruit or ice cream scoopers!  That's right.  I said boiled.  The eggs were boiled and not poached.  Whoever thought hollandaise and BBQ sauce went together is dillusional.    Maybe the chef was having a bad day.  Regardless, they only make breakfast. I expected them to do that correctly. I do not recommend this restaurant.",

I did not like it. It was very very bland. I should have looked at the photos via Yelp before ordering. My friend ordered the veggie sandwich which was very good. It's a great vibe in there as well. I would def come back but order something else off the menu.,",

She had gloves on but she would touch her Hair with the gloves.  She also would deliver the food to the tables outside wearing her gloves and would touch the door handle etc and then would return with the same gloves on and continue dressing the plates.  I think they need to check their filter on their dishwasher because their plates have An odor as though it needs to be cleaned.    My chilaquilas were served cold.  The beans and pulled pork were cold I'm certain that they had not been heated up properly before serving.  The pork appeared to be more like boiled not their normal from their bbq.  Maybe their under new management and someone needs to tighten things up.",

Her exact quote was \"I apologize but I didn't realize we had reservations in front of you and it's not like I can make people get out of their seats\". That's not what I was asking her to do.

Good restaurants start with good service the second you walk through the door and unfortunately these business owners need to realize that and do some more training with the blonde.",

The downside of this hipster, bacon/smoke smelling Kitchen is the service needs a lot of work/improvement. Mind you, this is a new place, so I won't hold it against them, yet. The owner/chef visited each table & he was working too (they were slammed with business).  I will return because the food was that good. My fiancee had the tacos huevos, & our good friend had eggs benedict. We all LOVED our food & the restaurant set up.",

I have never had a bad meal or service they are very popular and busy so sometimes you will wait a bit for the check or a refill but they bust their butts to get the food out and it is amazing, delicious and worth the wait wether it's savory or sweet it's all good all the time. The manager came around to check on us and we were told they are opening another location on the west side very soon. Good to hear as they are truly a special and very unique place for exceptional food and service.",

It's hidden in the corner next to a spot called Shabu Shabu. A good friend of mine wanted to catch up Monday morning over some brunch and I let her pick the spot. I wish I knew about this place before I moved clear across town. It's definitely worth the drive!  The service was great!! Our cups were never empty and we never had to try to catch their attention for anything we needed. I did want to try their strawberry shortcake French toast but the waitress stated that and a couple other things are oh offered on the weekends. Which gave me another excuse to return lol. Oh and they have different, variety of pastries available as \"starters\" aka appetizers!  As I've mentioned before I love that concept.   They definitely had one of the best brunches I've had in a while. Oh and if you're wondering what I munched on, I got the country Benedict and it was to die for. It was so good I digged in before taking a photo op! Maybe next time no guarantees!",

They have expanded the menu since they first opened.  I like to get their bagel with egg, cheese, and sausage.  It normally comes with bacon but I ask for the sub because I'm a sucker for homemade sausage.  This dish also comes with a side of potatoes.  For a nice vegetarian option, their \"meatless\" is a nice choice.  It's like an eggs Benedict but with fried green tomatoes instead of ham.   Service is nice and friendly.  I also bought a blueberry muffin to take home and really enjoyed it the following morning.  Not too sweet with plenty of blueberries.   A very good off the strip bfast option.",

From the classic oatmeal with real maple syrup and choice of toppings to the exceptional melted cheese, tomato and egg sandwich on excellent bread, a vegetarian will find plenty to indulge in.    We meat-eaters are in our glory though.  Try the chicken fried steak made with a filet cut, the burger with bacon smoked on premises, the ham and cheese crepe that will make you sing... Order one of the Benedicts with chipotle gravy and you'll want a tanker full to travel.  Great coffee, white sangria, mimosa, hot chocolate topped with toasted marshmallow, beer.  I am lucky to live close by. but it is worth a drive to get to.  Just a few blocks off the 215, plenty of parking.    Naturally, there's a wait at noon and on weekends, but order a beverage and enjoy the patio.  Say hi to owner and hottie, Javier. or manager Arely from Peg.",

After my bf and I waited about 30 minutes for a table. the hostess seats us at one that was halfway exposed to the sun. We did comment on it but she seemed to be a bit put off and said the curtain could be released but never did it. So after a while, as the sun moved, we became more uncomfortable and got another table. My bf specifically asked for his eggs prepared a certain way and he received exactly what he was trying to avoid. I had a fruit crepe and was less than impressed.  We were both disappointed and don't plan on going back.",

I order the Salmon and Begel then topped it off with a plan crepe. My palette was pleasantly surprised. It was just enough food to fill my late morning /early afternoon appetite.

Everyone around us was also upset. While waiting outside we heard multiple staff setting up tables in the patio complain about being there and how much they hated their job. This was definitely not the vibe you want when treating guests to a \"nice\" brunch. We finally got a table outside and it was pretty underwhelming. The seats were ripped, we got a bunch of disgusting, dirty paper menus, and the wait was ridiculous to even get our drinks. The food we ordered was overpriced and under seasoned. I was embarrassed because I went off of the yelp reviews but honestly, I think I've been more impressed with ihop. If you're going to charge on the higher end of the spectrum for the area at least have presentable menus and staff that have enough sense to talk crap about their job when they're out of the restaurant. I think these reviews are most likely the result of some type of incentive and I would strongly suggest spending your money somewhere else.",

My husband and I attempted to go one Sunday, but wait was 25 minutes... We left.  We tried again the following Sunday and we were seated in less than 5 minutes. I had the short rib Benedict with foie (additional $13) & mimosa. The short rib itself lacked flavor, potatoes were good. My husband had the Egyptian, it was too simple for his taste and Crafthaus IPA beer. Servers were friendly, but waited a bit for our drinks and food.... A guy who arrived AFTER us, got his food before us!! The staff all seemed to know him, so it seemed like they serve base on favoritism. I really wanted to like this place.  Hi Antonio,  Thank you for taking the time to respond. I think it's awesome to acknowledge regular customers. I feel customer service tends to lack in some restaurants these days. So it's nice to hear your staff takes the time to meet expectations. Though for the record, the gentleman did not order poached eggs and oatmeal. It looked a lot more elaborate, such as a country fried steak.",

The chef served our food (well actually he served us the food for the table next to us, LOL! But they were right on it for making it right and it was actually kind of funny) and shook our hand on the way out. The menu has a farm to table feel with my favorite Mexican/American flavors. Don't leave without trying some of the fresh pastries. Considering brunch is my favorite meal of the day, looking forward to trying something new every time I go. This trip we had the \"Shorty\" (short rib benny), tacos huevos, lemon/blackberry muffin & cinnamon twist. I literally can't think of a way to improve on any of the dishes.",

Our coffees took about five minutes to come out. Our food took 40 minutes! The people who sat down next to us twenty minutes after we ordered got their food right after we did. That's a bit ridiculous for that late in the day on a Saturday for French toast and an omelette. The French toast is just cake dipped in egg, fried and topped with whipped cream and strawberries. I honestly didn't care for it and the whipped cream was almost completely melted by the time I got it. My husband's chorizo omelette was good, but the portion of potatoes on the side was tiny and burnt. Like it was the leftovers from the back of the griddle. I loved the decor and ambiance, but that's not enough to get me to go back for another $42 breakfast/lunch.",

We had to wait about thirty minutes to be seated (there were four of us) but I've heard it's usually pretty crowded there, so be prepared to wait.  They have a small pastry bar by the indoor waiting area and everything on it looked delicious. There were also employees making mimosas behind the counter.  The menu is fairly large, which made it hard to choose what I wanted (also seeing all of the food on the tables around me) but I decided on the traditional eggs benedict. It was delicious, the eggs were poached perfectly. Every bite was full of flavor. The potatoes served on the side were really good too, could have been a little crispier, but that's just personal preference.  My girlfriend got the meatless eggs benny, which features a fried green tomato. We also shared some of their monkey bread, which was good but probably would have been even better if it was a little more fresh.  Our waitress was nice, the food came out fairly quick and even though the place was small we weren't forced to sit too close to the people next to us.  My table wobbled and it was really annoying. I tried putting a napkin under the leg but it didn't level it out enough.",

Found this \"Kitchen Table\".... We always looks for 4 or more   Did the wait list on line for a table - was told the wait is an hour, but we can come & Check-in, so we did.  While waiting to sit outside we ordered drinks at the very busy, and disorganized counter/bar. PS don't order the Bloody Beer!!! Very messy! , I had to go to the restroom just to wash my hands from all the stuff.... the restroom was disgusting ~ paper towel dispenser was not working ~ toilet paper all over the floor, pee on the toilet seat, etc. totally gross! If we hadn't ordered our food, I would have left right then!!!   We were seated outside, per our request (unfortunately)  the table behind ours had a dog!!!! It kept shaking its head & drool & slobber was being slung all over!!!! TOTALLY DISGUSTING!!! Not sure why a dog is allowed outside next to other patrons & wagging its tail & the owner would not keep it next to HIS OWN table!!!!  The best thing about this place was our server, Ilse- she was very informative about the menu & had good suggestions too.   I'm very surprised this place had so many stars for their rating!!!!  Just a heads up, look before you are seated & order!!! You may change your mind & go elsewhere!  They need new management or a Manager that takes pride in his or her place of work!!!  We have been traveling all over this country - I'm honesty saying ~ keep looking!!",

The only thing that kept me away from here was the wait. On the weekend, this place is the hip place to be in terms of brunch/breakfast, and I can see why. The interior and outdoor seating is charming while the fresh pastries are bringing you in with their flaky exteriors & warm, fluffy interiors.  I came during Memorial Day Weekend, and the wait wasn't as awful as I thought. It was about 45 minutes which is still pretty long, but hey, it was MDW so I can't complain all too much.  We got some coffee, OJ, and monkey bread to start. Afterwards, I got the country benedict. All in all, everything was pretty good. I'm not sure why I got the country fried steak benedict when I don't really like country fried steak in the first place. I guess I was feeling incredibly zesty that day. It's just not my favorite kind of breakfast food, but nonetheless, Kitchen Table made a solid, hearty benedict over a housemade biscuit. It was pretty good for what it was. The only thing I didn't like was that the poached egg for the benedict wasn't quite runny. The yolk was soft but almost like a creamy, thick yolk that has just past being soft boiled. It wasn't bad, but at the same time, it shows how the egg wasn't cooked well. At this point, I'm just being picky because things were overall pretty good.  The fabled monkey didn't quite meet my expectations. There wasn't much of the cinnamon/butter syrupy goodness, so I was kind of eating a biscuit with a light drizzle of sauce. I think people may have hyped it up too much for me, and when I actually had it, it wasn't as transcendent and decadent that everyone said it would be.  All in all, this is a great place that the neighborhood really enjoys. Is it my favorite? Not necessarily, but it's still on the list of places when people from out of town ask me where to get a decent brunch.",

The sweet, warm, pillowy soft monkey bread was everything I thought it would be and more. The pork belly benedict had enough heat from the jalapeno Hollandaise to wake up my palate, without numbing it and the pork was crispy, yet tender. The salted caramel pecan donut, to finish my meal was a nice, sweet way to end a great meal.",

We were the first ones to arrive at 7:30 and had our choice of tables. I did notice they were extremely close together so when it gets busy that may be an issue for some.   Our server quickly brought over water and coffee which is always appreciated. We started with an order of monkey bread and after so many good reviews I ordered the pork belly benedict. My other half chose the breakfast burrito. The monkey bread was served warm with a melted cinnamon type sauce.   The main entrees came out a little while later. After about 3 bites of my bene my nose started to run. The jalapeno hollandaise was extremely hot and spicy, way too much for me for early in the morning. It was just too overpowering drowning out the eggs and pork belly. I had to scrape it all off to finish the rest of it. My other half said his breakfast burrito was dry inside and needed some sort of sauce. The potatoes on both however were good.   The check came and it was $42. I left the $50 gift card and we began to leave. This is where the problem started.   As we reached the door the waitress stopped us and said we couldn't use the balance for the tip. The gentleman at the register (The chef I presume?) said the gift card could only be used for food. Since we didn't have any cash we had to buy a pastry and then add the tip to that. Ridiculous. I have used gift cards from everywhere from Mimis and Carrabba's to Flemings and Roy's and have always used the balance for the tip. Gift cards are the same as cash so whats the problem?  I wanted to leave 2 stars as I have had much better, however our service was good as well as the pastries so I will leave 3. The issue with the gift card really turned me off to this place.",

Food- I got the avocado toast which was tasty and the toast reminded me of a good Challah bread, with 3 egg small omelette, green salad and a side of chicken breads. Overall extremely yummy dish! 2. Service- besides of the waiting list outside the service was quick and professional.  3. Price- I must say that it was a nice surprise! Extremely affordable and yet high quality of product!  The one thing I would say is that the portions weren't that big. Honestly for someone like myself with a big appetite I would probably want and extra side dish.",

    "text": "My husband decided to take me out for breakfast to one of my Yelp bookmarks.  Kitchen Table was perfect as it was close to home.  Located on the corner of Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde, it's easy to find.    Kitchen Table offers delicious and unique items. They have fresh pastries staring at you when you walk through the door.  All look fantastic and eventually one day I will indulge!    Service was really great.  She came by frequently to refill my coffee which is always good.  The coffee, by the way, is delicious and full of flavor.    We decided on the Country Benedict and chorizo omelet to get a taste of each.  The Country Benedict is served on a biscuit with the poached egg and chicken covered with a chipotle hollandaise.  Yum.     I wished I had a bowl of that sauce to take home.  Fantastic.    The omelet had a great flavor from the chorizo. It's also filled with roasted chilies, braised onions and oaxacan cheese.  Spicy and that's just the way I like it.    It was especially nice to chat with the Chef.  I'll thank Mrs Shirley B for that little bonus.  I really enjoyed our breakfast here and I'm looking forward to trying many more of their menu items.",

No big deal considering how busy it was. What was a big deal was how long it took to get some bacon and eggs with pancakes. Over 40 minutes easy. Took like 20 minutes just to get our sweet bread.  My friend and I saw other people getting their food before us even though they ordered long after we did. Finally get our food and my potatoes aren't even warm. Ontop of which, we ask a runner to not put any butter on his pancakes which at that point was 20 to 25 minutes before our food came out and the runner says that it's already on the pancakes which sounded like our food was already made. At that point it should have been taken off. They couldn't even do that much based on how long our food took. And I'm not sure if the server just maybe forgot to put our order in but we barely even got checked on and only got asked how thing's were just the one time after our food was served and shortly afterwards, a check just came up. Not happy about this place at all.",

    "text": "The breakfast gods are pleased.   The hype around this place is definitely warranted, the food is amazing, the service is on point and the energy is intoxicating. The Kitchen Table warrants another trip to try a few more things off the menu.   Coming in on a Sunday isn't the best idea with the wait being about thirty minutes, but you can grab a mimosa, coffee or beer to sip on while hanging in the \"back\" patio area around the fire pit, I went with an iced Americano. The space here is cozy with the seating being pretty tight; your brunch buddies are literally an arm's length away.   The menu is veritable food porn at it's best, Pastrami Hash, Monkey Bread, Croque Madame, Foie and Cake, and a Hot Chocolate Muffin with Charred Marshmallow.  This is just the tip of the food iceberg, seriously this menu is stacked with greatness, and the greatness I chose was The Duck Confit omelet, a glazed doughnut, and a side of jalapeno bacon.   The Duck Confit is kind of a mind bender; eggs, tender duck, and a house made mac and cheese. So there's cheese in this, but not in the traditional sense, just the creamy salty cheese sauce from the mac & cheese. The duck was beyond tender and cheese complemented everything perfect. This was an amalgam made in heaven, mac and cheese, egg and duck. Nummers!  The side dishes were great as well. The Glazed Doughnut was insanely light, fluffy and disintegrated like cotton candy in your mouth with each bite, not heavy at all. The jalapeno bacon was tasty as well, I mean it's bacon, but I could have used just a touch more spice with these little strips of greasy happiness.   The menu has so many options, you may need some snacking advice from your server, but don't be afraid to ask because they are very knowable with the menu and can help you zero-in on your brunch option.   It's great to see more and more spots like this opening up in Henderson. Feels good man.",

Tucked away in a random, hidden corner of a strip mall with not much visibility means it relies highly on strong Yelp reviews and word of mouth. The 25 minute wait they gave me also meant the food needed to blow me away. And it did.  Communal tables, Pinterest worthy decorations, clipboard menu, hipster mugs and a full pig being roasted in the back right before your eyes. The customers almost seemed fake and placed by the restaurant, I've never seen anyone in Henderson dressed this cute! Atmosphere, check.  Breakfast/brunch food that are all Instagram worthy, check.   We ordered the traditional benedict and the Shorty benedict. The pork was too good to pass up on, order the Shorty over the tradiitonal.  The pastrami hash had thick slices of pastrami that made me want to munch on pieces plain. It went perfectly with the potatoes and eggs. The toast that it came with was PERFECT. I consider myself a bread connoisseur and the bread was as soft and delicious as plain toast can get. Don't bother asking for butter or jam- ya won't need it.   Come too late on a weekend and they'll be out of monkey break, coffee cake and biscuits. Kitchen Table was packed. I guess it just means I'll have to come back to try their pastries.",

I'm sure the unique menu is what draws everyone in.  It certainly was what sold me.  Duck confit AND mac n cheese?  Yes yes please!  Caviar on blinis?  Oh you fancy.  Doughnut sandwich?  Donut ask me again!  Inside looks like a flood of community quaintness - oak tables, open aired, modern, earthy.  We opted to sit out back in the patio after our server set up heating lamps for us.  Best seat evahhh!  We were the only ones out there.. all mine!  Just how I like it!  Loved the patio space.  Loved all the teeny-bopper pop song covers by dudes pumping out of their stereos.  Guy version of Miley Cyrus's \"Party in the USA\"?!  How can anyone say no to that flaming awesomeness?  Even though we were the only ones out on the patio, that didn't mean service suffered.  Our server checked on us several times and even had a chat with my \"celebrity\" friend about his artwork.  We ordered: * Country Benedict (added Foie Gras) *   You can add foie gras to anything for $12 so my friend opted to do so.. but $12 for a tiny sliver on only ONE out of the two benedicts?  \"What the foie?!\" indeed.. seems a little jippy to me.  Might as well not get it at all and support PETA.  If you know how they produce foie gras, you would feel as guilty as I did after I took a bite.  Besides the guilt, the benedicts itself had a nice combination of textures - crunchy fried steak, flaky biscuit, creamy sauce, and richness from that perfectly poached egg.  * Pork Belly Benedict *   Way better flavor than the Country Benedict, but lacks the different textures.  Delicious, but after the first benedict, my palette needed a cleansing from all the bold sauces and mundane, mushy texture.  The side house potatoes did not help.  I wish I'd swapped out half of my potatoes for a salad instead.  Two plates of benedicts is enough to fill us up and some.  Considering how heavy the meal was, the portion size was pretty generous.  I had a nice brunchy experience and their menu is definitely intriguing.  Can't wait to try more..  But no foie this time of course.  Ducks are cute!  Support animal rights!",

But don't let this scare you away - you most definitely want to wait for this food. We went on a Sunday and were told it was a 30-40 minute wait for a table.  So we did what any person wanting instant gratification would do.  We ordered food to go from the coffee counter.  You can order anything from the menu to go.  And we did! Avocado toast, Salmon Benedict, a chicken sandwich, and monkey bread..and a caramel macchiato.  I was disappointed that they didn't have chai lattes or fresh OJ but my macchiato was divine.   The food though! Absolutely scrumptious and a ton of it.  The avocado toast comes with eggs as well.  The benedict came with matchstick home fries - does that make sense?  And they were sooo good.  The eggs were poached perfectly as well.  The chicken sammie was served with chips, I assume housemade? All in all the food was wonderful and we got it in about 20 minutes!  To-go FTW. The prices are a little high but not when you consider the quality you are getting, and really I couldn't even finish my benedict there was sooo much food!   I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast tacos..and the cinnamon roll...and about 10 other things I saw on their menu..including mimosas!",

Then we get seated and it takes twenty-five minutes for our order to even get taken. Again, that's fine I guess, our fault for coming at a busy time. After we order though, it's another twenty minutes before our food is served. We ended up spending over an hour to get our lunch. Then we had to wait for our check... another twenty minutes.   It wasn't the waiter's fault, he was awesome. It was the management. The food was good but it wasn't amazing. I can't say that I would come back for lunch anytime soon. I would normally give this place a 4/5 if I was just reviewing the food, but the service was so bad I just can't.  Just a tip for the management, the faster you take an order and deliver the check, the faster you can turn tables and serve new customers. I saw 6-7 people leave the restaurant because they couldn't get seated in a timely manner. People only have so much time for lunch before they need to get back to work. The atmosphere and the food is good, you just need to work on your service times.",

Had the pork belly Benedict and it had so many wonderful flavors, the sweetness of the pork belly, the savory flavor of the egg and sauce, the spiciness of the jalapeno, the tartness of the greens all blended so nicely. Will definitely return again!!",

We tried to go back before we left and all their baked goods were sold out and the line was an hours wait! . We should have gotten up earlier!  It would have been so worth it!

I called at 7:30 to see if I could make a reservation for 1030a since we were going to be a large party and wanted to a least give fair warning . They don't take reservations but put us on the waiting list out of courtesy for a large party which I thought was nice. When we got there we were seated within 10 to 15 minutes and began to order.none of the sweet pastries i.e. monkey bread cinnamon rolls are even really worth eating so I started to get nervous. But once we ordered our regular breakfast and it arrived that all changed. Crepe was excellent, Benedict was excellent, chicken fried steak Benedict  was excellent, white chocolate French toast was excellent, monte crispy was great. They do need to work a little bit on the timing of getting the food out since a lot of it came out 5 to 10 minutes before the others at our table . Service was decent but not great. I would still recommend it",

Probably due to the volume of business that was going on. My father ordered a foie Gras and apple pancake creation that takes 25 minutes to bake. My complaint is that we should have been informed of that extra wait time at the time of ordering. My father probably would have gotten something different, had he known. The minor hiccups with the service are the only reason this place gets points off. I would definitely return because they have a lot of interesting items on the menu. Hopefully I can come back at a time when they are less busy.",

The bread fresh and the condiments perfect and accompanied by the home made chips-the perfect lunch.  I highly recommend the Kitchen Table-always good. Always fresh and very enjoyable.",

    "text": "After reading several good reviews about Kitchen Table in Henderson we (three of us) took the 15-20 minute drive to Henderson from the strip. The restaurant itself is tucked away in the corner of shopping center and not easy to recognize until you see the temporary signage the have hung outside. upon entering you are immediately struck by the amount of delicious looking pastries in the front with the kitchen immediately to its right and an expediting table in front. The dining room is attractive and spacious and will love it when the outside temperatures allow dining.  The three of us got the sausage sampler, smoked salmon and caviar blinis, and deviled eggs to start followed by three different egg benedict preparations and the french toast with foie. Loved the coffee, not the best I have had in Vegas but very enjoyable. The sausage sampler, with the two dipping sauces (maple syrup and a bourbon one) was fine, not great. The smoked salmon caviar blini were excellent bites and well delineated flavors. The deviled eggs were just ok. The thing that threw us off was how chilled the eggs were. I'm not sure this is a health department requirement, serving devil eggs chilled, but for this preparation it stunted the overall flavor profile of the dish.  The three different eggs benny war a bit of a mixed bag with the Pork Belly and Shorty better than the Country. The complaint about the country is while all the ingredients separately are great, we were not sure the biscuits held up well enough to act as a vehicle for eggs benny. Alone the biscuits were great but the one quality that makes a biscuit great, tender and flaky, detracted from the dish as a whole as the biscuit soaked up all the gravy and egg. I'd also say that the fried steak itself really lacked a great crust seeming a bit wet, as off the oil was not up to temperature for frying. Just my guess. Finally, the french toast and foie was fabulous. The caramelized pears with the nuts worked great with the toast and when you added the foie to the bit, simply bliss. My one gripe, which seems to many peoples complaint, was the minuscule size of the foie. At $22 they really need to step up the cut of foie to justify the fare.  Finally the best part of the meal was the staff and owners. Holy cow! What a pleasure it is to dine at an establishment that has such attentive, nice, proud, vibrant and beautiful people! From the bubbly hostess, wonderful waitress and nice owners, the Kitchen Table is what makes for the perfect start to any day in Las Vegas. I highly recommend, if you have transportation, making the trip to Henderson to start any day when you are in Las Vegas or if you live there.",

We waited an hour to be seated then another hour for our food to be brought out. They don't even seat ppl in order that they arrive; they seat by preference. I understand that seating is limited in such a trendy and new restaurant, but having such a cocky attitude doesn't help for their lack of accommodations . I probably won't recommend nor will I be back considering there are many other brunch spots that satisfy your appetite without making you feel like you're an unwanted nuisance.",

    "text": "I told my husband that we had to take one for the team and go on a scouting trip to check out breakfast places for when family is in town...  He happily agreed to join me and off we went to Kitchen Table.  Unfortunately, our first attempt was on a Monday Holiday and the wait was 40 minutes...  Good for them, bad for us.  We did not wait but returned the next morning to find no waiting.  A lesson in timing. We started with a lemon loaf and a cinnamon twist.  Delicious!  Moist and sweet, perfect with a good cup of black coffee.  My only recommendation is to bring more people with you so you can try more items from the bakery counter.  (Unless you are Michael U and order for 12! haha)  He ordered the Blue Collar and I ordered the Monte Cristo.  I am always on the hunt for a good Monte Cristo, so could not pass up the opportunity.  This was good, but I probably will try something else next time.  Just a little too heavy and crispy for me, but very tasty.  The Blue Collar was said to be excellent, eggs cooked perfectly and crispy bacon the way he likes it.  Somehow I missed out on getting a bite so will have to take his word for it...  The best endorsement is that he said he would happily return, which is a high recommendation.    The service was top notch, which we discussed after leaving.  We often have 'favorites' that are as much or more due to the service as opposed to the food.  The food of course has to be good, but we are going to cut them a lot more slack if the service is good.   At Kitchen Table, it was the best of both.  Excellent service and food. The family will be pleased with the mission's outcome.",

    "text": "We stopped by Sunday afternoon for brunch on a recommendation from a family member. The wait was 45-60 minutes, but we got skipped over on the list and it was more like an hour and ten minutes.   We finally sat, then waited another 10 minutes before the water guy came. Another 5 before the waiter came and brusquely asked what we wanted. Another 30 went by before we gave up and left since the couple before us gave up and left and they had been seated about 15 minutes before us.   The service was terrible, we were basically ignored. After the one couple left, their food came out and the waiter just started passing it around, being fairly rude about it. We weren't unique, the entire restaurant was full of people and we saw four dishes come out in 30 minutes and only three tables had food.   If you're looking for a up to two hour wait for food and iffy service, this is your place. It certainly won't be somewhere we would return to. As a small business owner, I'm appalled at the lack of service and inability to deliver food to that many waiting customers on a busy afternoon.",

There are tables designed for you to sit next to a complete stranger bench-like but allows you to be open and able to ask your neighbor what they are having to eat! They even have tasty desserts to finish it off. Overall a great experience dining there and recommend it to everyone in the henderson/ Las Vegas area, I'm sure they get many visits from all over!

    "text": "In short:  Positive: Food Service  Atmosphere  Negative: Noise level  Portion size to cost ratio  Wait time  The service was pretty good and the restaurant has a great concept and so does the food. Personally, I give this place 3 stars because I didn't walk out full. The food was decent, I had the french toast and it was 4 stars. The only caveat was that I like to eat a lot and I like to sometimes have bacon, if not some eggs and hash browns along with it. The French toast was $12 and I got 3 (on the smaller side) pieces of toast. I walked out full because I didn't want to spend $60 on our breakfast by ordering eggs and bacon. It was sort of hard to talk to each other and the server. I found not only myself but also our server asking to repeat what we said multiple times. The atmosphere and decorations were pretty cool. I like the idea and am a full supporter of mom and pop places. On the bright side, the food is good and so is the service.  For the most part, I believe my opinion was contingent on the choices I made. The restaurant is not bad, just a little over priced and loud. If you sit outside noise isn't an issue I'm sure and if you order something like foie gras or have a smaller appetite, it's worth it.",

Flavor to the max. - Eggs Benny Shorty - Eggs benedict with their braised short ribs they slow cook right outside. The sauce was bearnaise instead of the hollandaise. Delicious. - Pork Belly Nachos - Not as flavorful as the Chicken Fried or Eggs benny, but by far the most tender. A much more mild flavor with a green sauce salsa. - Hot Chocolate with charred marshmallows - Saw a lady next to us get this and we had to have it. They blow torch the marshmallows on top and it was the best cup of hot chocolate I've ever had.",

I was so excited to go for Mother's Day and asked if I can make reservations I was told no,if you're coming early morning just call ahead an hour. On Sunday morning I called ahead and they put me down for 8:45 a.m. we arrived and they were busy which is understandable because it's Mother's Day. It took about 5 minutes to check in and when I did the girl said she didn't have me on her list she would check with another to see if I was on that list. 5 minutes later she came back and said she had the table but could not seat us because they were behind. We would need to wait another 20 minutes just to sit down. There was no way we could do that with having a 19 month old with us, again, why I called ahead.  We left and that pretty much ruined Mother's Day.  I was still very excited to try it so, today,  on Monday,  I figured I would go in and grab something to go with my little boy. I walked up to the to go bar and there are three people standing back there all talking amongst themselves and don't even so much as bother to acknowledge me. Then,  they look at me and all walk away from the counter.  I have been in customer service, as well as business development for over 20 years and this is not the way to run a business. I called to speak with a manager and was asked who's calling and I just do not have time for this. I figured it would be best to articulate my experience online for the manager to look over.",

We got the cinnamon roll, monte Cristo, the burger, and the short rib Benny. Everything was delicious. I took away one star for the cinnamon roll; it was not great, I will try monkey bread when I go back (because I WILL go back). My friend asked to have the monte Cristo covered in powder sugar and they accommodated no problem, but the strawberry jam that came with it was delicious! I ate it with a spoon because pouring it into my mouth was too barbaric.   The burger was the best we've ever had--jalepeno bacon whaaaaat?--SO GOOD. Short rib Benny was perfect, poached egg gooed all over my muffin and the potatoes were super flavorful. I can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu.",

But I think the A/C was broken so they have a plug in unit which helped but it was still hot inside, which is why I gave them only 4 stars. Service was friendly but a little slow. They were packed and we waited 45minutes to sit but totally worth it. Fresh pastries and interesting meal options. Had the daily special of braised short rib hash in a sourdough bowl and hamburger helper omelet (seriously amazing!)  Will go back!!",

It makes me wonder what time you need to get there in order to try this unicorn treat. So instead we ordered an orange juice for my son and he also tried the chocolate banana walnut loaf. It was moist and flavorful, like a cake. It still wasn't monkey bread though so he was disappointed no matter what (#5yearoldemotions). My husband also ordered the sweet bread. It looked like cinnamon toast but it was slightly different and was served with a strawberry jam. My husband enjoyed it. It reminded me of a cinnamon toast and churro lovechild. My husband ordered just the standard eggs, sausage, potatoes, and wheat toast. I cannot even explain how scrumptious the sausage was. It was tender, flavorful, and it melted in your mouth! I would eat a whole plate of it. The potatoes had more of a Tex Mex twist with peppers. He said the eggs were standard, but he also loved the sausage. I had the fruit crepe which was light and gently sweet. It was served with a large dollop of creme and a mixture of strawberries, blueberries, and a slice of peach. Inside the crepe was a mixed berry jam mixture which wasn't too sweet. It was a nice balance. Our entire bill came out to $26 which didn't seem right I thought just the crepe, eggs, and orange juice was already $24. But we aren't complaining. I'd love to come back and try some of the lunch items as those looked good too. And someday...I don't know when, but someday, we WILL get the monkey bread!",

When we got there we checked in thinking it would be a short wait but we were told an additional 20-30 minutes. Right after I checked in I got an email saying I was taken off the waitlist. We waited and waited watching people who arrived after us being seated. After 30 minutes we asked if we were close to being seated. The hostess informed me she emailed me 25 minutes earlier to say our table was ready. For one I did not get any email saying our table was ready. Secondly we were sitting 5 feet from the hostess stand and she had been regularly calling out names of parties the entire time. Why couldn't she call out my name considering I was sitting right there?  We were finally seated and met by our waitress. We told her about the waitlist situation and expressed that now we were in a crunch to get to our appointment on time because of the hostess's mistake. She quickly took our order and our food arrived in under 5 minutes. We were very pleased with her service and for taking the time to listen and care about our situation.  I had the pork belly eggs Benedict and the monkey bread. Both were delicious.  We will be back but hopefully the restaurant fixes the hostess situation.",

Kitchen Table is a good place to socialize with friends/family. It has Southern California ambience due to the open windows with green surrounding the area.   Quality/Quantity: 3.5/5 I ordered the meatless Benedict with egg whites and it came with fruits. The Benedict was filling but was not overpowering. My cousin Reanne ordered the ham and cheese crepe. The crepe has a refined texture that adds a well-rounded compliment with the bechamel sauce. The quality of the food was well balanced yet healthy to make you feel fulfilled. The quantity was a reasonable size and of did not overpower each other.   Experience: 4/5 I had a efficient professional experience at Kitchen Table. They were attentive but not demanding. They refilled our waters consistently, they cleaned our table, and asked if we needed further assistance. Unfortunately, there was a fly that went around our food that cause a slight disturbance. Overall, I enjoyed the service that was given at Kitchen Table and the professional that was captured.",

    "text": "So I came here once before and I had a horrendous experience with customer service so I decided to leave my review pending because I am the type to feel that one bad visit does not determine the overall quality of a restaurant.  However upon returning to kitchen table with an open mind I was met with disappointment. Not only did I have to wait 15 minutes to be attended to when we were first sat, I actually had to pull a Buser aside in order water and the appetizer that I wanted. After that it was also pretty much downhill. The waitress walked by me and my family multiple times with empty water glasses. When I first ordered the waters I asked to have a couple lemon wedges as well. The waitress whose name I do not know because we were not taken care of as the 7 steps of service would ensure(bartender and server experience) you should always make sure that your table knows your name. After about 45 minutes our appetizer arrived which was DELICIOUS. The only reason I'm giving kitchen table 2 stars is because of the busser named Rocky who after pulling him aside and asking him to refill our waters, from that point on our experience was completely different because Rocky never let us have an empty glass of water and consistently attended it to our table and removed any unwanted trash or plate. Sadly I will not be returning unless I see on the reviews that the service for has a improved. I'm never the one to leave these kind of reviews but when sitting at a table and being thirsty and not attended to with family who are also feeling the same way. I can't help but to express my views and how I felt. Thank you rocky for doing the most that you could for us.",

In fact, the only time we saw the waitress was to place the order and get the check and tip. No coffee or water refills, nothing. They were out of the crab dip, out of the jalapeno bacon and out of something else. By the third \"out of,\" I must have rolled my eyes, because she said, \"It's not my fault. I just work here.\" Okaaaaay, it isn't but your management sucks.  The biscuits get to the table and they are mealy. The tacos huevos get to the table and they are cold and not well filled. The regular bacon gets to the table and there are only 2 pieces in each pan. I said, \"We both wanted an order.\" She said, \"That IS two orders.\" Okay, so that's $4 for two regular thin slices of bacon. I can't do this.  NEVER AGAIN!",

We walked in as a party of four and several waitstaff turned their head to look at us, and then silently back to what they were doing. After about two minutes of standing the waiter cleaning silverware directly in front of us finally offered us a table. Weird. We asked to be seated on the patio which was comprised of several ripped booths, arranged in a semi circle surrounded by umbrellas laying on the ground. The food was priced where my expectations lead me to think I deserved better than a tattered seat for a $16 sandwich. The food all tasted like the same mustard-y vinegar-y flavor and was no better than subway or home cooking. I will not be returning, mostly due to the uninviting staff and makeshift ghetto patio.",

    "text": "First time here on a Sunday for brunch. Ill give it a 3.4 stars.  The wait was very long (40-45 mins). COME EARLY if you want to try this place. Its not a very large restaurant especially when we arrived they had closed off the outdoor seating area (possibly due to the heat).   Food selections were very interesting and all very tasty!!! Staff were friendly except the hostess that day was a tad slow. When tables became empty she just let it sit, and didn't call for the next group to come in, which delayed the wait time even more.... overall the other staff were good.   Items ordered on this visit: Monkey bread- similar to a cinnamon bun, but made in a skillet Croque Madame- made with Challah bread and cheese and ham. tasty! Foie & apple skillet cake- this was a very interesting one, made very well with the pancake very fluffy, not your normal pancake. EXCELLENT!!!",

    "text": "I've had Kitchen Table bookmarked for a while and finally gave it a try today. I left satisfied but not blown away (especially given the wait time).  We had the peaches and cream pancakes and the country benedict, both of which were good (8 out of 10). Pancakes cooked perfectly, the peaches, cream and syrup weren't too sweet. It's also a large portion, enough for leftovers. The country benedict was a biscuit with country fried steak, poached eggs and chipotle gravy. Great flavor and filling.  For $12, the crab and avocado dip was disappointing. It's more like a queso - 90% cheese, some poblano pepper, about 1/3 of an avocado, and very little crab.  I love the waitlist function thru Yelp, but the wait was longer than estimated and I noticed some people who arrived after others (no reservation, no waitlist) and yet they were seated before them. Once seated, service was also very slow. It took a while for the server to take our order and a long time for the food to come out. As a frame of reference, we put ourselves on the waistlist at 12:35, arrived at 12:50, seated at 1:30, received our food at 2:15pm - on a weekday :/",

On that particular day the heat was broken and it was very cold inside. We should have turned around and left. However we decided to stay since we had a doctor's appointment close by. The atmosphere was casual. Menu was quite extensive including all different and unique dishes for breakfast as well as lunch salads and sandwiches. My boyfriend had the oatmeal and I had eggs bacon over toast. My meal was good but nothing special. My boyfriend's oatmeal was average and for the price the serving was small. The biggest disappointment was the fact that it was too cold to be comfortable. We had to keep our coats and scarves on just to be warm. Because it was cold outside they should have  close  the place down or provided heaters. I asked our waitress if there were any discounts such as free coffee or something that management was doing for the environment and she said unfortunately not. The bathroom also needs to be cleaner. Will not be coming back. Too many great places to eat for breakfast to pay over $30 for a mediocre to bad experience.",

    "text": "First things first, I would highly suggest that you join the waitlist via Yelp to put your name down, especially if you plan on dining on the weekend. My sister and I visited Kitchen Table on a Saturday morning and were quoted with a wait time of 45 minutes to dine inside. While we were putting our name on the list with the hostess, the other hostess was on the phone with a customer and putting their name on the list as well. I'm not sure if this would count as a reservation, but regardless, use the waitlist option on Yelp or call ahead!  After waiting outside for about 25 minutes minutes or so, we were called inside to be seated. The dining area inside is a lot smaller than I had imagined, but they definitely managed to make the space work. The interior is very hip and charming. I loved the wooden tables and lighting accents. The atmosphere definitely gave off that \"social eatery\" vibe.  Upon being greeted by our server Raphael, we immediately placed our order with him since we had some time to check out the menu while waiting for our table. The menu is not your typical American eatery menu. Kitchen Table has a very unique menu and the flavors are extremely diverse. We ordered the Monkey Bread to share, I ordered the Chilaquiles, and my sister ordered the Eggs In A Basket.  Monkey Bread- I personally thought that the Monkey Bread was a little too dry. It wasn't chewy like I had expected it to be, but instead a little crispy on the outside. The cinnamon glaze was amazing. Overall, a good way to start (or end) your meal. The presentation was very cute!  Chilaquiles- I am definitely here for this! The Chilaquiles is a must! My meal was so filling and packed with flavor. I'm not a fan of sunny side up eggs, but this was the perfect touch for the dish. The dish had just enough spice, but I had to add some of the green habanero hot sauce! I love my food spicy. The smoked pork was nice and tender, not too much fat. I would order this again, no doubt.  I enjoyed brunch and would definitely return to Kitchen Table to try other dishes offered. How am I going to order something else besides the Chilaquiles though? It was that amazing! Next time, I have to try the Prickly Pear Mimosa that everyone is talking about! Thank you to Raphael for the awesome service!",

Can't wait to now experience the new dinner vibe and menu.  We have our go to favorite \"pork belly chili verde\" on a regular basis. My husband has had the hamburger, French toast, pastrami hash and so on.   The outside ambiance is amazing with shared tables and the inside is like eating at home.

Our mission was to find a bloody mary spot but unfortunately they only sell beer and wine. Our waitress recommended their Bloody Beer and I ordered an iced mocha.  - Iced Coffee Mocha This was very delicious. I was shocked to see there was no mocha syrup inside my cup, normally you can see some chocolate but it was still bomb! Worth it.  - Bloody Beer Since they didn't have any BMs we decided to try their beer version. It was pretty good, I have to admit. I'm not a beer person so that says a lot. Beer makes me bloated so I didn't drink much of this. Worth trying if you like bloodys and beer.  I didn't want to eat anything too heavy since we were going to EDC that night. I only ordered two appetizers:  - Greek Yogurt Don't let the small cup fool you, there was actually a lot of yogurt in this. It was good too, came with fruit and granola. Nice little meal if you're trying to stay on the healthier side.  - Bacon & Egg Shooters I love deviled eggs, so I was stoked when I saw they had some. I don't know if my stomach shrunk but I couldn't finish this. I saved two eggs for later and glad I did, it was yummy having them for leftovers later that day.  Our waitress was very helpful and gave great recommendations. She checked on us frequently and was very friendly. We left happy regardless of not having what we originally wanted.",

He asked me what types of fruit I liked and prepared a mango flavored tea that was a hit. The servers are highly attentive and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. It feels as though you are eating at a friend's home.   I was happy to hear that they have or are in the process of opening a new location in Summerlin (closer to home).

I've come here quite a few times over the last year, and my opinion of it has lessened gradually. I probably won't come back after this point.  Firstly, it appears that they don't always have air conditioning, which is troubling during the summer. they have large fans on the floor to circulate air, and the doors are open frequently--leading to an occasional crazy amount of flies hanging around. I'd go outdoors if I wanted that.  Secondly, I came in today, and they had no pastries, duck, one type of tomato, or green chilis, and their coffee machine was broken, so we couldn't get any specialty coffees. Maybe this was bad luck, but that's an absurd amount of things to not have--basically a third of the menu. Also, one time they had coffee, but no coffee CUPS for us to use... That was odd.  Thirdly, I tried to come in a month ago, but they were closed. There was no sign posted stating they would be closed, but an employee from the kitchen happened to walk by and let us know. Some sort of advance notice would've been nice.   Anyways, this place can be great at its best. But quirks hold it back. Normally, with this many gripes, I'd give a place one star, but man their food is good.",

    "text": "We have enjoyed coming to KT since it opened but this visit was disappointing in the extreme. First the actual restaurant is really looking tired and run down. Second we were seated at 1030 and informed they were completely out of all pastries, really not a good sign. My eggs Benedict were over cooked as well as my wife's scrambled eggs (looked more like a pre made omelet you would get at a motels free breakfast) In my opinion with the opening of the owners new restaurant the Stove, this restaurant is floundering. It's a real shame. I fear that this once great spot is dying from lack of attention.",

    "text": "We really love this place. We are from the NW and lived in Portland for nine years where this community farm to table fresh food feel is the norm for almost all restaurants. This restaurant felt like home!   There was a wait for inside about 20min, but to wait we were asked to go outside where it is over 100 out. Inside the tables were very close together and it was pretty loud. For these reasons we decided to deal with the heat and eat outside since we'd have to wait outside anyway. That was about the only downside. They also don't have misters or fans so it can get quite hot.   My husband ordered the egg white frittata, it came with toast. He also added a chicken breast to this. We had water to drink because of the heat. They kindly brought us extra ice and left us a pitcher of water.   I ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict over English muffins. They were delicious!! Perfectly poached eggs and ordered the hollandaise sauce on the side. The pickled onions added a nice flavor and mixed well with the salmon. These came with their house potatoes, delicious diced potatoes with peppers, I loved that you could taste the flavor of the potatoes and the chilies with minimal to no oil.   I also ordered the strawberry shortcake French toast, AMAZING! I liked the thick bread and the strawberry sauce wasn't overpowering or too sweet, it was just right.   We will definitely be back to try more dishes. I drive by this spot everyday, wish we had tried it a lot sooner!",

I woke up Sunday morning, looked on yelp to decide where to go, saw kitchen table accepted reservations via yelp....awesome!  Put my name down, my phone number, it says via text to arrive in approximately 35 minutes. Great. Get my family together, drive down, check in and the hostess tells us they do not use the yelp app and it's going to be an hour and a half wait. Needless to say, I was not happy considering my other options, the stove and craft both take online reservations. I however could not get into either of those either because I wasted my time with kitchen table. I do love this restaurant but I think this is a deal breaker for me. Had the hostesses been more apologetic or tried to accommodate at all, I might have reconsidered but I  sadly think I am breaking up with kitchen table.",

The moment you walk in, there's an open bakery to grab some monkey bread or chocolate chips, you can sneak a peak in the small kitchen. The place was cute and felt like home.  Some of us got hot  and I got Mexican hot chocolate, super yummy it's more of a spicy cinnamon hot chocolate. Definitely got a kick. It's topped with torched marshmallows and chocolate syrup. Maybe because it was busy but our food took a little long to get but everything came out right and everyone like the food.  The bourbon syrup that came with my husband pancakes were also delish! We wanted to buy it but it was $12 for a small Bottle, were talking like travel sized listerine bottle here.. a little steep for my liking. But overall  Can't wait to go back.   Updated: When first time we ate here, I didn't really want to include the service because the food was really good. But when we went, refills took a long time and we ordered a side of hash browns, which they ended up giving for free because we were done eating and they finally came out. Next time we came, Sarah, the manager came by and made sure we were taken care of. Our food came out super fast and our server was so attentive and great! Seems like the place is more organized.",

The food was looking great but the chilaquiles were bland. The pork was not even flavorful and the sauce was bland, no spicy flavor and they were very dry.Service did forget to serve my crab cake after everyone at the table had their food. The crab cake was really good so I think it's was just a bad day to go because it was too busy. I do recommend this place give it a chance...your experience might be different than mine. Also the cream brulee late is good.",

    "text": "I had French toast with bacon and eggs. Everything is on separate plates which was different. My over medium cooked eggs ran off the plate due to being on a coffee coaster sized plate.  That how small the two egg serving was (must not use grade AA size eggs).  My over-cooked French toast had no butter so I had to ask for some.  Bacon was was ok for taste but was hard and chewy.  The coffee was weak even though they give you allot as it is served in a 12 oz cup. I then tried a cappuccino to see if it was better and all I tasted was the foam so it must not have had an espresso in it or the cup was too big n they put too much milk. They may have to double up on the espressos if they are going to serve cappuccinos in the 12 oz cups. Overall there a other breakfast/brunch restaurants that are way better in the local area, so I will probably not ever go back to this one.",

It was the greasiest sandwich I have ever eaten. Like the oil was literally dripping out of it. Asked the girl that dropped out food off for some sauce to dip my chips in, which I never got.

We had the bagel egg sandwiches, which were very oily and heavy as a result. The jalapeno bacon was very soggy and eggs were over cooked. The egg wrap was half decent, probably a 3/5 given it was somewhat dry and overcooked.   I will give a 5/5 for the bakery items... the muffins and bread are both amazing. I'll likely return for a muffin and call it a day. Certainly will not return for an in-house meal, I'll take my muffin to go.",

    "text": "This place opened right around the corner from where I live and thought my husband & I should finally give it a try.  I've been looking for a small, quaint place to go for coffee where I can disappear, other than Starbucks or Panera.  So, the location is obviously perfect & we tried it on Sunday around 930-10; it was packed (obviously a good sign)... We had to wait about 40 mins.  There's indoor and outdoor seating; we got seated indoors.    So, the only thing I HATED was the seating arrangement, which is huge for me (I almost gave 3 stars because of it).  There's several tables & booths throughout that are very tiny and close together.  Then there's one long table that I believe has seating for 16-18 people.  They seat multiple parties at this one table even if you don't know the people; it's completely awkward and uncomfortable.  So, you are basically sitting right next to people you don't know & can hear their entire conversation.  We were seated there first (we had our toddler with us) and I told the host ABSOLUTELY NOT!  He wanted to give us a booster seat for a chair, which is completely unsafe.  So, he kindly moved us to a corner booth seat, which is the best seat in the house.  The only other complaints were that they didn't have the air on.  Omg!  It was stifling... I felt like I was having a never ending hot flash.  The other complaint was the music was too loud for a family-type upscale joint...it felt like a bar atmosphere with the volume level.  Now, the most exciting part was that they were playing 90's R&B music (kinda weird with the rustic chic decor), but I was in heaven.  Not to mention 80's music including, none other than Ghostbusters... My fave!!!  We ordered coffee, which tasted amazing!!!  The menu offers more upscale food (i.e. Duck, quail eggs, caviar) and my immediate thought was, uh oh, I'm not going to find anything I like.  I came across the Frittata, which consisted of egg whites, zucchini & cauliflower puree.  OMG... The puree was unbelievable; the best I've ever had. It was pricey ($13), but I was not disappointed.  My husband got eggs Benedict and he didn't leave one crumb on the plate.  All in all, I would definitely go back for the coffee and am excited to try other entrees.  The downside is definitely the seating arrangement; very awkward & kinda pricey.  The owner should think about expanding because it was jammed pack and the wait was a little too long.  If I had somewhere to go after, I would not have stayed.  Several parties left after they were told how long the wait was.  Oh, and the staff was amazingly friendly; our waitress was on the ball.",

I won't go back service was terrible. I didn't even get to try the food and this was the second time I've been there and left. Won't bother for a third. Tried to get my comment removed I'll just repost it!!  Edited 5/11/16 gave it another chance! First off the hostess rolled her eyes at me when she found out there were 4 of us and had to set up a table. My apologies for having a family!! So the table she set up for me and my family was kind of a joke. Imagine myself at one end of the table and then my wife and two boys on the side in an L configuration! Wasn't happy but I let it roll. Hostess then decided to take out drink order. I opted for just the water, my wife did the same and we ordered my boys two Apple juices. She came back two time to confirm what we were drinking. Really!! Half the drink order was on the table!   Our waiter was cool and the food was actually pretty good. A little expensive but good! I got the taco's huevos, my wife got pork chili verde, and we got the boys some sausage and a cinnamon bun and a muffin. My wife's was the best and the sausage was super good. The cinnamon bun was a little undercooked I think some might like hat I don't and the muffin while my wife liked it the kids and I didn't. I got a hint of dishwater rag in it. I originally gave this joint 1 star, I have since changed it to 3 only for the good food that we had and our waiter who took care of us! But the hostess gave terrible customer service and was super rude and obviously doesn't know what she's doing. Still wouldn't recommend because of her!!",

    "text": "It's hard to give an accurate rating for Kithcen Table. A friend and I came here around 10:15 on a Saturday and was told a 30-40 min wait, which was fine. The wait ended up being an hour and 10 mins not because tables were full but because they weren't being bussed fast enough. Our waiter was a little too friendly ( close talker) but helped make menu choices. My friend ordered the salmon bagel and a carrot muffin and I chose the standard breakfast fare- eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes. The flavor of the food was decent but everything was really greasy- even my friend's food. So here's how I would rate kitchen table if it had categories:  Atmosphere: 5 Food:3 Service: 3 Prices: 4 - everything is priced decent  I would probably return on a weekday and try something more adventurous because it is a really cute place,  located fairly close to my house.",

To our dismay, we were politely informed they were out of monkey bread...my wife was disappointed, however the staff quickly picked up on it and provided a chocolate muffin as a substitute.  It was very sweet and perceptive. Soon after, Chef Pedro greeted us and explained the menu.  This was a delightful surprise.  We ended up ordering everything on the menu.  The Nutella French toast, the duck confit omelet, the shorty, the cirque madame and almost every appetizer. Everything was incredible and the champagne with guava and mango juice was refreshing and delicious.  This was one of the best brunch experiences I have ever had in Las Vegas.  The staff, the food, the attention to detail was amazing.",

I loathe eggs with a passion, but found the traditional eggs Benedict and veggy Benedict to be perfectly delightful.   No one talks about the chicken sandwich. This dish is amazing.  One of the best sandwiches I've ever consumed.  The side of 'tatoe chips is kind of a letdown, but whatever. This sandwich is KILLER.   I'm not sure you could go wrong with anything on the menu.  It all seems delicious and fresh.  I hope this location keeps up the good work!",

    "text": "The food is still good, but the recent experience, which was yesterday, was not so good.  We arrive at the restaurant around 1:20 pm and waited about 30 -35 minutes before seated. We were place at the 2-person table right behind the check-in counter.  If you have been to the place you know exactly which table I am talking about. It took us less then 5 minutes to order our food (around 2pm) , but it took the kitchen 45 minutes to prep our 2 entrees.    It would have been a okay experience, except 1) the kitchen ventilation was insufficient, so while we were there we sucked in enough burned kitchen grease to last us till the next visit which wont be soon; 2) the 2 person table needs to be removed or avoid it at cost.  It faces the kitchen where the greasy smell is overwhelming at times and staff bumps your chair everytime when he/she need to get/drop off utensils and plates.  Very annoying!; 3) please improve your food prep time!!  45 minutes for 2 entrees - a Frittata and a shorty, was excessive.  We come the restaurant on average once a month; however, due the recent experience we won't be coming back soon, unless the location improves it s ventilation system and improve its food prep time or I have 3 hours to kill and missing the greasy smell of the kitchen.",

Brooke was awesome with dealing with my food allergies and being attentive. I first ordered the empanadas made out of squash! Those were pleasantly delicious and would order again. I then ordered the foie and apple skillet.  I paired all of that with a prickly pear mimosa...say what!!! The flavors were outstanding. Who would have thought to put those two together? I would definitely recommend coming here and I guarantee I will be coming again, there are so many others items I need to try!",

Chef Javier and his partner have created something very special right here in Henderson.  I had the Pork Belly Benedict with jalapeno and BBQ Hollandaise. The combination of flavors was awesome.  Coffee served in over sized mugs. Very fast and friendly service with live music on the weekends gives it a very festive feel. They even have an outdoor patio and gazebo dinning for larger groups.  My only problem was choosing from a very full offering of menu selections.  I will simply have to return many times to taste each dish.  Oh did I mention the fresh baked on premises muffins and breads.... -)  Definitely under priced for the value. A real winner!",

The menu online is different from the menu at the restaurant and what you get is different from the menu at the restaurant but that wasn't a big deal. The service was probably the worst part. We were 1 of 2 tables and our food took 30 minutes and came out cold. The fresh mimosas were good but $8 each and we finished those before our food came and was never asked if we wanted another. I would give it 2 stars for service and 4 stars for food (if it was warm) for a total of 3 stars. It's worth a try but I wouldn't go back. Could have been an off day which I would assume based on how much everyone raves about it.",

You're welcome).    Chef Antonio was a fantastic host, and I do mean host.  He made a point to circle around the room and visit every couple or group eating to check on the meal and see if they needed anything.  He gave us free muffins (beyond description) because of some tiny mistake by the waitress (a who-would-actually-care-type-of-mistake).  With that being said, Yelpers, don't go in there being a douche expecting free anything because someone else got it and you've written 179 reviews.  It was a very impulsive, kind thing he did, and we sincerely appreciated it.  The only reason I even wrote that was to try to shed light on how much Chef Antonio actually cares about the people eating there, sharing his works of food-art (as corny as that sounds).      Rare, delicious, and flat out friendly would be how I would describe the Kitchen Table.    We talked to almost all of our neighbors who insisted we try their food (I can't believe I actually did), and they guided us through what I consider an impressive menu.  This is a place for the loyal \"breakfastier\" (I made that up).  I loved it - straight up loved it.    I had the Chiliquiles by the way, and will be going back.  I plan on telling anyone searching for a good spot about this place.  No questions asked, the best breakfast I believe I've ever had outside of when I tell my mom she cooks the best breakfast I've ever had.",

    "text": "Sharing positive dining experiences with friends and through Yelp, as well as becoming a regular at your neighborhood restaurants are of the utmost importance to these establishments! Supporting your local business's and spreading the word is how these places become successful and stay open!  With that being said,  I have been here more than a half dozen times, I have taken several friends and family members in, and I tell EVERYONE about all the delicious dishes, friendly atmosphere and vibe Kitchen Table offers. From the moment you walk in to the end of the experience, everything is spot on. Being acknowledged right away is key and they do a great job of that. Once you are sat, you are greeted by a friendly server (Brooke is my favorite) and a drink order is taken. Take your time reviewing the menu as there are tons of incredible items to choose from. My absolute favorites are the Pork Belly Green Chili and the Short Rib Benedict. Let's not forget the Prickly Pear Mimosas that I can't get enough of. The manager Arely and the owner Javier are wonderful too. They always make a point to come by the tables to make sure everything is great and that you are enjoying your experience!   I will continue to frequent Kitchen Table as often as possible and bring my friends and family in. You should do yourself a favor and check it out! You won't be disappointed!",

Don't order baked goods!  I soooo wanted this place to be good.  I ordered the ham and cheese crepes with Mornay Sauce, they were good, very rich though, could have used a few berries or something for acid, but good and I do like rich.    My husband however made the mistake of ordering the Monte Cristo.  My husband had a cold so he couldn't taste the food that well, I kept asking him how it was and he was saying ok....men!  Anyway he gave me a piece to taste and it was saturated with rancid oil or something that tasted so rank I had to spit it out.  I think they must have reheated someone's order or something I don't know.  The waiter was very nice and took it off the bill, but ewe!  I wish the manager or owner would have come over to say something though.    I loved the diversity of the menu, perhaps it is too diverse if a simple Monte Cristo can't be navigated.",

However, inside is a bit crowded. I really think once it get warmer, it would be nice to eat outside. Service staff was friendly. Getting your drinks and food took some time. The food was delicious. The Shorty was a five star. Everything my friends had was great. The only reason I gave this place a four star was I wished the dishes that came out was warmer. I like a hot breakfast and service for coffee needed to be quicker. Definitely, will go back and try something new.",

Service was a little lacking considering there were only 3 tables of other diners, but it was almost closing time so maybe they all had to go clean something. The muffin was a little lackluster. The veggie sandwich as amazing. Cute ambiance but the fake flowers detract. I think foie gras should be banned for animal cruelty, so that was a con as well.",

Also nothing more annoying then a rocking table. With all that small stuff aside the food is incredible. My son had pork chili Verde. It was awesome. The pork was moist and chili Verde was not overpowering. It was there to compliment the pork. Also came on top of chips which added a nice corn crunch to it. I had a pork belly Bene. Everything about this dish was top notch. Eggs cooked to perfection. Pork was very good and the English muffin under it all was still nice and crunchy not soggy. I give them a 4 star only because they were having kitchen issues. Food was coming out real slow. The patio was nearly full and only one table had food. Our server and forgive me for forgetting her name but was on top of things and offered us some of the tastiest muffins. Banana nut and a chocolate chip. Sooooo good.       Also being on the patio we were provided some entertainment by a pigeon. Some people might find that gross or annoying but it took our mind off of how long our food took. I will return the next time I'm in Henderson. Kitchen aside 5 star for the food and the friendliness of all the staff. Great place!!!! Go!!!!! EAT!!!!! NOW!!!",

My boyfriend and I decided to try this place this past Saturday and expected it to be busy so we didn't mind waiting. We decided to sit outside as it looked less crowded and there were seats in the shade. However the hostess took us to a table sitting directly in the sun even though there were two empty tables in the shade next to us. Apparently those tables were reserved for friends of the staff and manager (who did not have to wait in line to be seated and already had their food on the table upon arriving 10 minutes after we did). The silverware and glasses were too hot to even touch but there was no where else we could sit.   My boyfriend wanted a cinnamon roll to start with and the waiter said they were out. Two minutes later I see him bring one out to his friends at the table next to us even though they didn't order one! Throughout the whole meal we needed refills on water since it was so hot sitting in the sun but all the waiters and manager bypassed us to talk to their buddies. Even when we tried to ask the waiter about items on the menu he would interrupt us to talk to his friends. Our waiter did not check on us until he brought the bill.   My boyfriend always finishes his meal before leaving a table but we were both so annoyed and hot that we just gave up and took most of our food to go. The service here was so poor that I probably won't be going back, which is unfortunate since the food was tasty. The staff needs to focus on taking care of paying customers instead of hooking up their buddies.",

The place was so inviting. Staff was friendly and genuine. We ordered. The table next to us got their food which made me instantly regret my choice. The server and table noticed my dismay and assured me I would me happy with my selection. They were absolutely right. The food was absolutely delicious. The whole experience was fantastic. It's only breakfast, I know. But it was the perfect ending to our time in NV. Next time we go to Vegas I will make it a point to eat there again. I have but 2 suggestions. Pillows because we sat in the corner. Couldn't lean back. Maybe upgrade the coffee. I suggest Kona. But I drink it black so take that with a grain of salt. Salt... That reminds me. They have Himalayan salt in their shakers. How cool is that? Ok enough. Go eat at the Kitchen Table. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Hello and welcome to Kitchen Table. Greeted instantly and seated right away. This is a social dining experience so there are a few tables that seat many people and seemed like it may be cramped. We were seated at our own table against the back window, As you enter the store you notice a giant butcher block that is the center piece of the restaurant and has a big logo on it. Our table was unique, made from 2x4 planks and not planed down, So if a board is warped you will notice it in your table. I actually wanted to find issue with this but found it authentic. The hostess took our drink order and we had to wait a bit for our waitress Ilse to bring them. We arrived at or near the same time as the other guests around us so the delay is forgivable. The guests near us were all trying this spot for the first time as well. The menu comes on a clip board and you can flip through it to find your meal. I might add they do make their own pastries and there is a counter at the front to order from.  We ordered french toast and the meal that every good breakfast spot is judged, Chicken Fried Steak. French Toast was actually french bread not Texas toast or a random flat bread. The Syrup was amazing also. (see Photos), Chicken Fried Steak with Chipotle Sausage Gravy, I was reluctant not to see traditional gravy, but this place is far from traditional. The Steak was thick and delicious, Gravy had sausage flavor with a small Chipotle bite. There is not salt and pepper on the table, my eggcame peppered for meI found this very impressive, Big fan of this meal. We spoke with guests around us and all enjoyed the meals they had as well. There was this Mexican Hot Chocolate that one guest had that I need to try. It had toasted marshmallows on top. I will take back the social aspect being negative since Josie pointed out that I am one of the most social people she knows. Drinks were always filled and waitress was very aware and kept checking in.,  I saw a grill outside and asked what is was used for. It seems every couple days they smoke a pig and pork belly, so every pork product on menu is from their own smoked pig or pork belly. I did not know this before ordering now I will try the Pork next time we eat here. Goodbye and thank you for dining at Kitchen Table. On the way out Chef Antonio shook our hand and thanked us for coming. He and another chef there were very personable. As we left the wait was greater than when we entered so get here early, We will be going again and I believe we found a new favorite breakfast spot. Take the time and effort to try this great place. You won't regret it.",

We ordered the pork belly Benedict, Jersey Joe sandwich, and bacon and egg bagel. Wait staff was great.  Host staff was the only reason for the loss of one star - we didn't receive a normal level of customer service to be expected when we entered. An enthusiastic greeting/farewell would have been the icing on the cake.  We enjoy supporting local businesses so will definitely go back to try to sweet side of the menu and coffee.",

We ordered the duck and cheese omelet and the vegetarian hash. Both were pretty generous servings.

Honestly I have plans to eat there again, but it'll just be to give the tip to whom deserves it. Not sure why the manager was begging me three times to leave a tip, maybe it was for her.

Tucked behind Paradise Shabu Shabu so it is difficult to locate from the outside, but they have a giant sign pointing to the restaurant once you are in the parking area.   The place is very cute, you really do feel like you are sitting in a kitchen. We got there at around 11 and they were full, a few minutes later and we should have had to wait. Service was very quick, hostess was friendly, water was brought out and orders were taken very quickly.   We shared The Cavier, which was 3 little pancakes topped with smoked salmon, quail egg and a little caviar on top. This was amazing! I have never been a fan of smoked salmon, but their smoked salmon was amazing. The fish was fresh, firm, not too salty , didn't smell fishy at all and simply delicious!! Definitely recommend this dish!  I had the Pork Belly Green Chili. Came with breakfast potatoes, topped with chips, pulled pork, two poached eggs and green chili...absolutely delicious! The had two big chunks of pork belly along with some shredded pork scattered on top. The green chili was sour and salty, tasted so fresh and delicious! Portion was huge, could not finish the dish on my own.   My sister had the Pork Belly Benedict, this was also really good. The BBQ sauce on the pork belly was sweet and savory, two big slices of english muffin, lots of pork on top with two eggs, served with side of breakfast potatoes. I liked the potatoes but they were very soft, my sister would have preferred if its as more crispy.   The only negative thing about is place is that it is quite small, tables are very close together, it was very awkward trying to sit and get up without hitting people at the next table.   I will definitely come back, they have a really big menu with so many items to try, so many items sounded good and it was difficult choosing which dish to try. Until next time...",

I ordered the vegetarian hash as my \"main\" breakfast based on our server's recommendation and I'm glad I listened. The hash was roasted veggies including corn, peppers, onions, zucchini, and potatoes. There was a ton of flavor because of all the spices used. The hash was topped with two perfectly pouched eggs.   Deliciously, flavorful comfort food!",

I like the decor and i like that theres outside seating available. Although it was windy so we sat inside. There was no wait time when we arrived which was great because we were so hungry. I ordered the chilaquiles and they were so good. However i had to add sour cream because they were too spicy for my taste that i stared to not enjoy it. Maybe next time ill ask if they can make it with no spice. My friend got a burger. I also got a black coffee which of course gets refilled but they already serve it in a oversized mug which is great.",

Something about a fried green tomato!!  Don't forget to get a bucket of mimosa.  Personal favorite was guava and blackberrry   Loved sitting outside on the patio.  Such a beautiful restaurant inside and out. This is a must stop for brunch or lunch.  The plates come out so beautifully that you don't even want to eat it.  Finish off your meal with monkey bread and your day will be just right. Thank you to all the staff for taking such great care of us.",

    "text": "For appetizer, we started with the bacon and egg shooter. Those were tastey but average. They were composed of a hard boiled egg, with some mayo, pickled jalapeno and bacon bits. Like I said, it was tastey, but left me wishing there was something else to it.  After we went to the avocado toast and the pork belly benny. I was told the toast was good (I didn't get to try it) but the pork belly benny was amazing. It had a nice kick and left me licking the plate at the end. I am already thinking about going back tomorrow to get another one.  The mimosas are great. They use Wycliffe which is a horrible excuse for champagne (it costs like $1.50 per bottle to the restaurant) but the mixers made it delicious. Try the blackberry mimosa. I wanted to just set up an IV of it directly into my blood stream. The mixed berry was good too, but the blackberry was much better.  Service was very good. We were created with a warm smile when we arrived and were seated quickly-- it may have helped that we used the yelp check in for wait list. Service was non intrusive and added to the experience.  Try sitting outside. During the right time of year, it is beautiful. There's plenty of umbrellas and covers which make it so you'll be nice and comfortable.   I can't wait to go back!!",

That didn't stop  us, it just made our decision easier. We ordered a bottle of sparkling and classic orange juice. I was also excited bc weather is nicer now and they have patio seating. I love being outside! We ordered the crab queso avocado dip while we made our decision on our entree. Almost everything in their extensive menu sounded delicious. We then ordered the tostada and green chili pork. Everything was delicious! Our server was genuinely friendly and accommodating. I did rate this place 4 stars bc another person sitting by us pointed out the patio seems to be a bit let go. The umbrella had a few burnt holes in it, a lot of the chairs were torn from the bottom, and there is a shed that looks dusty and the doors seem to be broken. Regardless, those are minor factors  compared to the delicious food and the great service. We had a great time here. I will definitely come back here again.",

Fun selection of breakfast mimosas if that's your scene, and don't miss the bacon and egg shooters. Don't miss this if you get a chance  Also FWIW, watched the chef come around to every table to ask how the meal was and even go grab a cup of coffee for a guest.",

I initially ordered the Apple Skillet, but was told by the waitress it would take 30 min. to make, which it would've been helpful for that to be stated on the menu. I was hungry and didn't want to wait that long, so I orders something else.(The regular French toast) Well my food took about 30+ min. to come out. Had I known, I would've just stuck with my original decision.",

My sister was here visiting and we made the trek from the northwest for breakfast.  We each had the Country Fried Steak Benedict.  This was the final day of our visit and we had eaten country fried steak in three different cities.  Her words were, \"This is the best breakfast I've ever eaten\".  It was certainly delicious.    One of the highlights of any visit is the coffee.  I had just had diner coffee  for four days, so good coffee was one of the highlights of the visit.    The service is always good and the atmosphere is always great.  I've eaten inside and on the patio.  This is a place I recommend to everyone",

    "text": "Ok this place is awesome and I wish they had one closer. The Kitchen Table is located in a strip mall in Henderson. Not your normal strip malls, this one is super clean and very nice. We were immediately greeted in the front with their cute entrance way decor. It was such a beautiful day so we decided to eat outside. The place was packed but it wasn't overbearing. We had a booth outdoors with a shade overtop. The only thing that could have made it better if they had some live music. It was only breakfast so they may have had in the later hours. We had mimosas with our meal. These mimosas were delicious. Prickly Pear and Pineapple. The menu was great. So many different choices. What caught my eye was the Egyptian breakfast plate. ( pictures included) Poached eggs, spinach and a Egyptian sauce with little nuts. It was delicious. The rye break that they serve is so plump and full. My husband had never heard of monkey bread (where has he been living?) so he had to have this. Not quite a morning plate but he had to have. Oh so good..reminded me of my moms she used to make us.   When we were leaving we noticed they had a bakery bar too. For quick meals. I highly recommend the Kitchen Table. It is more upscale and a little more money than your average breakfast joint but it is the experience that you're paying for and the atmosphere. Cant wait to have breakfast here again.",

You'll definately come out stuffed, due to the quantity they serve. The food tastes fresh and delicious. I loved the empanadas. They were so soft and flavorful. The chilaquiles were packed with so much flavor that we cleaned the plate.   My suggestion is that the fruit crepe has more fruit. They do call it a \"fruit crepe\" on the menu after all. I felt the fruit was a bit on the stingy, they only had about 4 pieces in a very large plate.   And lastly please don't bring us the bill so soon. We know that there is a waiting line, and we'll hurry. The fact that they bring us the bill before we're done is kind of rude.   We are coming back. We very much enjoyed it.",

    "text": "I have been here a few times so thought it was about time to write up a few words for them.   Starting with the food.  I've had the opportunity to try a good amount of food.  Everything I've tried has been on point.  Great selections with lots of options.  Good flavor profiles.  The chilaquiles have a great flavor and spice to them. Eggs cooked exactly as asked.  The huevos rancheros has a nice smokey taste and cooked very nicely.  The croque madame was to die for.  Nice rich gruyere sauce over perfectly cooked eggs. Great flavor profile. The sweets!! White Chocolate French Toast, Crepes, even the short stack with the cream they place on top was amazing.  No syrup needed.  The mimosas were probably the main reason for me going there the first time lol...they have a few sweet, syrupy ones to choose from.  All very delicious.    I've had 2 different experiences with the service when I've gone.  A couple times it was great, and a couple times it was sub-par.  The times it wasn't great it seemed they were short staffed.  Food took a bit longer and server didn't come around very often for drink refills.  Even paying took a while.    I would say between service and food I would give it somewhere between a 3 and 4...but the food will push it to a 4 above a 3.    Tips:  Arrive early, as it gets pretty busy.  You can avoid lines if you get there early.    The monkey bread is so delicious although they sell out quite fast so you must get there early for that as well.    Indoor seating gets pretty warm.  Probably due to the semi open kitchen right there.  Outside is very nice if you go when it's cooler out.",

Just a tip the Yelp check-in time is not accurate as when we arrived on time according to Yelp we still had according to the host 40 minutes but it actually only took 17 minutes to get seated.  Started off with the sausage sampler which was amazing with the little cups of syrup my favorite of the selection was the Texas hot link.  Was in a Benedict mood so we ordered the short rib Benny as well as the pork belly Benedict. Both were delectable and the eggs were poached to perfection.   To drink I had a Mexican hot chocolate which I wish the marshmallows were toasted a bit more. I really like it whenever they're almost black! Also the regular coffee was pretty legit to.  My only complaint was that the water glasses smell like rotten eggs and fish. Not the water just the glass itself because I ordered sparkling water and when I smelled the glass with the sparkling water in it it smelled pretty bad.",

So once we got there at the designated time they told us ten minutes. Which is whatever - who cares, it's ten minutes on a Sunday morning!  Thirty minutes later we asked about our table. There were huge parties being served before us. (We were waiting outside - dying in the Vegas heat. Other guests that were waiting had iced water I'm assuming they got from the restaurant) So the hostess didn't apologize or anything and said it'd be two more minutes! Our party was excited! We're in Vegas for the weekend for a bachelorette party and we were starving.  So after waiting anything 15-20 minutes after being told '2 mins for our table' we went back up.  No apologizes - the hostess barely took the time to look up at us and told us another ten minutes.  At that point we were done so we walked out.  Overall very disappointed and will not go back.",

We definitely ordered more than we needed because the portions were so big, but we boxed them up and took them with us and they were gone by the end of the day.  Service was wonderful - our waiter made great recommendations and answered all of our questions attentively. Even the kids.   There are pastries to buy at the bakery at the front of the store as well. We skipped them but had many regrets later.

    "text": "Eh , Well, I really want to leave a 2 star review but I will go ahead and leave a 3 star for now.  So I came for a late Mother's day brunch with the fam bam. OMG that Vegas weather is killer hot. First impression after walking in, Like all the baked goods were sold out already , yeah that sucks.., and MAN it was SOOOOO hot in there. Turn up the AC past a tickle will ya ?  We put our name on the list, went to go run a quick errand, and were like seated in like under an hour or so.  What we ordered:  chiliquiles country fried steak benedict croque madame and * cant remember the exact name of my dish but it had short ribs, english muffin and egg w/foie gras  Le sigh.  I was like soooo excited to try this place, you can add Foie to anything?? Could this be too good to be True? But sadly, I left seriously sick to my stomach. Puuhhhlease look at my pics and you will see why..  Anyways, Everyone enjoyed their food, BUT me. I tried a little nibble of the short rib meat, eh.. plain. So , the short rib meat lacked flavor, but that would have been bearable, Nothing a little hot sauce can't fix right? I checkout the plate, and literally EVERYTHING is swimming in straight oil! Whyyy... Whyy would you do that?!??!  I ate the egg, picked at the meat, but the salad was wilted from the hot oil bath, and the potatoes and the muffin bread had also absorbed some of the excess oil. Well well... this is the first time foie has lead me astray. WTF happened u say? It was obvious that the oil used to sear the Foie gras was also dumped onto my food, ALL OF IT, ALL OVER MY FOOD. Since we were there celebrating Mommas day, I didn't want to mention it, but when our server came around, I finally decided to tell her. She saw the oil, and said she would tell the chef about it. She comes back to tell me, Foie gras is supposed to be oily. Uh yeah the Foie itself is fatty, but my food should not have been swimming in the oil it was seared in.  Mr. Chef Antonio, Did you even look at my dish to see what had gone wrong? It was a simple newbie mistake that someone in your kitchen made that could have easily gone noticed and fixed. However, you were too busy meeting and greeting guests instead of checking the food quality before sending it out. Yeah people pick your jaws up off the ground, I did just say that. Oh no she didn't ! While its nice to mingle with guests, food needs to be up to par before socializing etc.  I'll probably be back when visting fam again since they enjoyed their dishes, but I will steer clear of the Foie Gras.",

I almost didn't want to touch it but when I did I couldn't stop.  It is very homey inside which is comforting.  I can't wait until I come back here!",

Highly recommend putting your name on the waitlist prior to arrival. We had a party of six and it was a gorgeous day so we sat outside. We arrived at 11:20 a.m. on a Sunday morning. We heard to order the monkey bread but when we place the order for monkey bread it was already gone for the day. Seemed a little early for their best item to already be out for the day. For appetizers we ordered the empanadas, breakfast taquitos and crab queso. The appetizers were very good.  For breakfast I ordered the chorizo omelette. There was very little chorizo in my omelette and almost no flavor. The potatoes that came with it were way too greasy for me to even eat. I'm still giving the place three stars because I really enjoyed the appetizers however I would never ordered the chorizo omelette again and I'm a big fan of chorizo and omelets.",

    "text": "True enough, this small tightly confined restaurant serves an extensive variety of foods both for breakfast and lunch.  I was shocked and dismayed, however, upon realizing that the restaurant serves foie gras (seared foie).  To produce \"foie gras\" (the French term means \"fatty liver\"), workers ram pipes down the throats of male ducks twice each day, pumping up to 2.2 pounds of grain and fat into their stomachs, or geese three times a day, up to 4 pounds daily, in a process known as \"gavage.\"  This process is cruel and inhumane. Typically, the ducks or geese subjected to this type of torture are confined their entire lives in tight pens that do not allow enough room to even turn around.  When you consume foie, you are supporting animal cruelty - all creatures being considered as \"animals\" for this purpose.  When a restaurant serves foie, it is promoting animal cruelty.   Therefore, when you patronize a restaurant that promotes animal cruelty, you yourself are supporting animal cruelty.  The person(s) who owns this restaurant should be ashamed. They should immediately cease and desist from serving any food which represents the byproduct of animal cruelty.  If you are somewhat claustrophobic, you may have a difficult time maneuvering at this restaurant. The restaurant environment itself is tightly confined, consisting of two or three large couches with benches, forcing people who do not know each other to sit adjacent to one another. Makes for some very uncomfortable situations. And coffee is an astonishing $3 per cup, totally outrageous.   For ethical and moral purposes, I will not patronize this restaurant.",

When I asked the front hostess if somebody could at least bring me water she said someone would be right by and no one ever came. I ended up walking out and leaving without ever having contact with any staff. I did go back another time with a group of friends, and the service was still mediocre.

    "text": "Stopped in here on a late Monday morning as my parents were heading out of town. Place was packed. I didn't realize that a lot of their seating is at a long large table. I am not a fan of that type of seating. I was there with my elderly parents who do not like this type of seating arrangement either. It was hard to talk to them since the noise level of the other patrons was so loud. They also had heavy thumping music playing in the background which caused every person to talk louder. I am OK with music but make it something lighter & softer as then people tend to not talk so loud. Ordered the Blue Collar ($9), Kielbasa ($11), Pastrami Hash ($13), & Green Chile Eggs ($12). My Mom said the Pastrami Hash was spicy. I've never known Pastrami to be spicy so I guess maybe this is Kitchen Table's take on it? The Kielbasa was OK but I wasn't impressed for the $11 it cost. All the salt & pepper was dumped on 1 spot in the middle of the eggs. The Kielbasa was hard to cut so I don't know if it was the skin on the Kielbasa or their knives need to be sharper. But I wouldn't order it again. I also was not of fan of the house potatoes as they were mushy instead of being crispy. I did like the rye toast. My Dad enjoyed his Blue Collar although he mentioned the toast didn't have hardly any butter on it. We asked on of the waiters (not ours) for butter & he said he would get it but never did. Once our waitress came back around we asked for it again & she promptly brought it to us. My brother said the Green Chile was good but a little too spicy & he likes spicy food. The chef had came out & talked to many of those around us to see how they were but never bothered to see how we were doing.

I had the chicken fried steak and the chopotle gravy was truly amazing. My daughter had potatoe soup and homemade biscuits. Once again amazing and my mom said it was one of the best monte cristos she ever had. We will be back!! As another reviewer mentioned, you can tell the difference between a cook and a chef! The Kitchen Table has an amazing chef!!!",

The chefs are strip-experienced and the high quality food they make shows that these guys really know what they are doing!",

I bring all my visitors here. The service is great, the girls that work here are sooooo nice and attentive (and gorgeous). Yes there will be a wait on the weekend, but it's a small place with a ton of loyal customers. A wait for a table does not equal bad service or deserve 1 star..... that's just crazy. Call ahead.....A wait is a good thing!!!! Short rib is incredible, everything is incredible. Try adding salted caramel to your French toast!!! A friend asked if it was possible after seeing it used on the drink menu and they were happy to accommodate. Delicious.",

When you walk it in smells so good and they have several baked goods displayed to get your mouth watering. We had the short rib Benedict, the bagel and egg sandwich with bacon, and the blueberry French toast.  The short rib Benedict was really yummy, and the eggs were perfectly poached. The meat had lots of flavor without being salty, and the hollandaise sauce was delicious, and actually pretty light tasting, somehow. The breakfast potatoes were also soft and flavorful, though I personally prefer a little crispyness, they were still tasty. The breakfast bagel was a surprise hit, for being such a simple dish it was delicious, again the eggs were perfectly cooked, and the jalapeno bacon was unbelievable, so good, and of course, cooked to perfection, the bagel was griddled which added a buttery toasty crust which was delicious, and a nice touch. This dish also came with the same breakfast potatoes, which were good. The blueberry French toast was also good, the bread was high quality and the dish was good. The blueberry compote was a bit sweet for me, but I am not a huge fan of sweets, or blueberries for that matter, so take that for what it's worth.  The service was friendly, and perfectly adequate, we weren't wowed but we also weren't displeased. Overall we would definitely recommend this place to friends, and we will be back if we are in the neighborhood.",

Not a problem waiting for a table but noticed that there were several empty tables and no one seated outside. More people came in and the wait now was 30 minutes, I heard the person at the door say that they were backed up in the kitchen so that is reason for the wait. Finally seated and was greeted immediately, we placed our order and the coffee came which was lukewarm. Shortly later our meal came and looked and smelled fantastic. The Eggs Benedict was very tasty, but not very hot even the potatoes were cold. Very disappointed with the temperature if the food and drinks. Still debating if I will go back.",

The interior is uniquely \"rustic\" (very cosy) and the outside seating is wonderful as well. Last time we went (Sunday) they had a fantastic singer playing for us on his guitar! The food is DELICIOUS! I can never make up my mind of what to order since it all sounds great! Service is awesome! My favorite breakfast place in town for a relaxing Sunday morning!!!",

The egg shooters also a favorite of mine along slide with the monkey bread to start. The Mac n cheese omelette is vey unique and delicious.

With an inventive menu that is constantly evolving I can't wait to go back often and enjoy everything the restaurant has to offer.   The restaurant gets extremely busy so I recommend coming early. We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday morning and we had no wait at all, but it filled up almost immediately after we were seated.   We started with the monkey bread which was amazing. I ordered the duck Mac and cheese omelette. An extremely creative take on breakfast that left me excited for my next visit.  The service was excellent. Our server was attentive despite being very busy and the chef came out to check on all the tables as well.",

    "text": "*Military discount*   Went on Sunday 2-21-16 at 9:50 AM with my girl Jamie P.  This restaurant is located on Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde in Henderson.  The place was busy but we only had to wait about 30 minutes. The hostess puts your name on the list and then comes to find you when your table is ready.  I can only imagine they do that by writing down a small description of you.  It's a nice change from just hollering out names and I thought it was unique.  I wondered what my description said.  Probably \"hangry lady with floral pants\".    When I put our name on the wait list I told the hostess two adults and a high chair, please.  We were seated inside at a cramped table.  People were packed in there like sardines!!  Chef Antonio offered to take my stroller to the front for safe keeping since there was literally no room at the table, which I appreciated. No high chair was ever brought, nor did they bring utensils or water for my son.  This place seems to not be very kid-friendly.  Most places at least have crayons or something for the kiddos.    $30.28 got me a biscuit, PB&J pancakes, coffee, a mimosa, a tostada, and a side of fresh fruit for the boy.  I also sampled my friend's taquitos, croque madam, jalapeno bacon, and pecan roll. They were out of two things that we ordered and we had to make a last minute substitutions with the waitress breathing down our necks.   It took about an hour before any food came out of the kitchen.   $6.00 Pineapple mimosa was tasty...very natural, fruity, and fizzy.  This is my first mimosa so I have nothing to compare it to but it was very refreshing and I enjoyed it.    $3 biscuit with house made jam was delicious.  It was buttery, flaky, warm, and everything a good biscuit should be.  Their house made jam was exceptional and went very well with the biscuit.    $6.00 fresh berries and fruit consisted of a coffee cup full of cantaloupe, fresh pineapple, and one strawberry cut up on top.  It was my son's breakfast and after waiting an hour and 20 minutes for it he began to melt down. Turns out it was just sitting on the pass and out waitress forgot about it.  With no high chair it was like trying to tame a wild, rabid, wolverine.  He finally calmed down after his fruit arrived.   $8.00 Tostada was....alright.  The tortillas were nice and crispy and topped with black beans, pork, a refreshing cilantro slaw, and a quail egg.  A little too expensive for two tostadas, although they were much better than the $9 taquitos which were poorly rolled, broken, and had almost no filling.    The best part of the meal was the PB&J pancakes.  They didn't even need syrup.  I would have loved a bit more peanut butter and jelly but I found myself wishing I could eat these again tonight.     The whole time we were there I was sweating.  The thermostat on the wall said 80 degrees which is just too hot for me to be able to enjoy eating.  Also it took a little over two hours to eat here which is just too long IMO.  You can get a meal comparable to this elsewhere, cheaper, and faster.    We paid and I went to the front to get my stroller and they had it folded and shoved it up under an armoire by the hostess stand.  Thanks for putting my stroller on your dirty floor underneath the armoire.  I loved pulling the dust bunnies off it.",

Luc or Loose the new manager is the most repulsive person I've ever met in my life not only does she speak to everyone with uttermost disrespect, she is rude,unorganized and has turned the kitchen table into a cluster! I'm so sad to see this place in the mess she has turned it into. I will not be returning while she his driving KT into the ground.   Original post: My favorite breakfast in town! Yes wonderful food. Unique, eclectic,and delicious. Even better the service. My husband and I go at least once a week, usually more, for the staff treats us and everyone else extremely well. There is a strong sense of family, just like Cheers. They know most everyones name and are so pleasant to be around. The entire team makes an effort to ensure you have a wonderful experience; from the servers, management, owner, and chefs. I love this place dearly. Primarily server Maria. She's on her game! Beautiful! Personable! And expedient. If it wasn't for her perfected service i wouldn't be there weekly. Thank you to Maria and kitchen table staff.",

There always seems to be a wait.  I'll get right to it. The service was excellent. Our server Nicole asked us if it was our first time there and then gave us the story of where the chefs came from and how they came up with the menu. She was very friendly. The chef even delivered our lox and bagels to the table.  The food was outstanding!! The Lox and Bagel with a fried egg was delicious. The meatless eggs Benedict with fried green tomatoes and the eggs Benedict with short ribs where also amazing. The house potatoes where also very good. They were a bit spicy, just the way I like them.  I definitely recommend that you pay Kitchen Table a visit. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Five of us gathered at Kitchen Table for brunch recently.  We tried a number of dishes that Chef Nunez selected from the menu and it was obvious from the beginning that we were in for a treat.  Two of us were there a little earlier than the rest of the group and we had some sweets.  Soon the others had joined us and the parade of dishes began.  Each one so very creative and tasty.  We were served:  White chocolate French toast PB&J pancakes Parmesan broccoli tort with smoked salmon Strawberry shortcake French toast Egg Mac Kitchen Avocado toast with poached eggs Pork belly Bene White chocolate French toast Foie Mac Muffin  We thought we'd have the sweets first and then the savories but it turned out that many of the savories were sweet and oh so good!  There wasn't one dish that fell short.  Everything was on point and some of them seem like they come from a mind that says, \"What would happen if I put this on that and then served it in an English muffin with a side of greens.\"  I was really taken by the avocado toast with the poached eggs.  What a different dish!  The two mac muffins were very good and definitely savories while the white chocolate French toast and strawberry shortcake French toast were delicious and perfect for the sweet tooth.  I can't end without mentioning the PB&J pancakes.  They were buttermilk pancakes with house peanut butter and house made jam.   Service was excellent.  Clean plates and silverware were brought for each dish (which the 5 of us shared lest one think I'm truly a pig).  Coffee was continually refilled.  Speaking of which, they have outstanding, rich flavored coffee.  I can't recommend highly enough Kitchen Table for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  Now I know why my friends have been buzzing about this place.  It is good!",

It's worth a try but maybe not worth the drive. Our crepe was under cooked and the chilaqueles were missing color and flavor. Hollandaise sauce was good and the pancake was very good.",

We had the traditional French toast , chorizo omelette and the country which was a chicken fried steak with a pouched egg on a biscuit. It all was perfect and amazing. A must try for sure.",

Such an adorable atmosphere, very cozy and quaint. Did not get to try the monkey bread or cinnamon rolls because they ran out, but I will definitely need to go back for those. Took my vegetarian friend here and she loved it. We tried the egg white frittata and the vegetarian eggs benedict, both fantastic and a must try!",

The venue is rather small and doesn't take reservations. I came on a Friday morning and my group had to wait for about 15 minutes before we were seated in the outside patio space. Our table was right by a speaker blasting covers of top 40 songs from the 00's. One of the waiters even made a joke about how we were sitting right on top of the speaker. It wasn't annoying as much as it was bizarre. I guess we just lucked out with the prime seating.  The service was attentive. Our waiter was polite and patient. I ordered the vegetarian hash with a coffee. The hash consisted of squash, potatoes, and similar tubers topped with two eggs over easy. The food was surprisingly filling. The coffee was good as well. I liked the look of the speckled earthy stoneware plates and mugs - imagine something out of a Pier 1 Imports.  As a Hendersonite, I'm glad I can get cool brunchy food close to home without paying the Strip premiums.   I'd recommend this place if you have friends visiting and want to go somewhere with good food and good mood.",

The seating process is disorganized and more than once after being seated we are left waiting .... waiting ... waiting to be acknowledged for the initial drink order. It's often happened where another table that was seated after us was approached before us. Servers seem either inexperienced or like they don't care about providing their customers a good dining experience. We've tried giving Kitchen Table the benefit of the doubt as we love the food and WANT to love this place ... however, after our last experience where a famous DJ and his entourage were served their food before we even had our drinks (we were seated at least 20 min before them) .... we gave up on them. Hopefully they read this and can do some staff development because their food really is very good.....",

    "text": "I can't comment on the food because we didn't stay long enough to try anything. I was pretty excited to try this place given the innovative menu. Unfortunately this is one of those restaurants that believes in packing in as many people as possible. First thing the hostess does is bypass several open tables at the front of the restaurant to seat us in the back where everyone is packed in like sardines.   The tables were so close together that my husband who is tall and thin had to turn sideways and shimmy between. I may think my husband's butt is spectacular but I doubt the people sitting in the table next to us held it such a high regard as it swept past while they were trying to eat. Does anyone really appreciate this communal type seating? It may be ideal if you know the people sitting a foot from you but it is pretty awkward and uncomfortable if you don't.   The final nail in the coffin so to speak was the noise level. As if the patrons packed in so tightly wasn't loud enough the piped in music competed and resulted in a cacophony of unpleasantness. We had to resort to yelling at each other from across the table which ironically was generously sized in that direction.   Finally when I voiced my concern to the hostess as we left she just smiled and apologized rather than offer us a different seating option.",

    "text": "Ugh. I loved this place. It was perfect. And part of it are still perfect. The food is absolutely the best you can ask for, and the location is perfect for me. This was \"my official breakfast spot\", but it's been slipping and now I don't know if I will go back.   I am a \"go with the flow\" kind of person. Super chill and relaxed. So it takes a lot to get me going, and I have never written a review like this, but the state of the place compels me to write this in hopes that the owners read this and try to make changes.   My main complaint is the service.  I don't know if you were trying to save money by only having two servers working on a busy Saturday and Sunday morning? You have like seven bussers running around doing things, but only two official servers. There are open tables both inside and outside, but they leave so many people outside waiting for seats because they don't have the ability to serve them.   Now let's talk about the speed of the service.  When I sit down I shouldn't have to wait seven minutes for someone to come and do the initial greeting at the table.  I know this sounds kind of petty, but it has become a normal thing there.  Our group of four put in  an order for lattes, and this time I decided to actually time it.  After 20 minutes I decided to say something to the waiter. He got frustrated with me and said there's no way it's been 20 minutes. (I honestly timed it) Three minutes later he brought out two of our coffees, and of course, becoming the norm, mine was cold (and I do mean cold). I started another timer after the first two coffees made it, and it was another seven minutes until the other two showed up, hot I might add.   Last time we came, we got our coffees after our food arrived. What's the deal?!?!  Look, you were the jam to my toast, the milk to my cereal, the bees knees, buts it's all slipping away.   I'm not writing this so that people don't try this restaurant. Please go here and try it.  It has the most amazing food.  I just don't get it with the servers.   Please hire more servers, and speed up the damn coffee.   Thank you.   May 2017 update  Things have been better here the last few times I have been here. It's good to start to see the service starting to catch up to the food.   June 2018 update  Well the service has been consistently really good. The food is still awesome as always. I see good things in the future for this place.",

    "text": "FYI. DO NOT BOTHER TO \"JOIN THE WAITLIST\" Off of Yelp, this restaurant does not honor it. We joined the wait list 40 minutes upon arrival as per instruction. When we came inside, there was 3 hostesses that did not bother to give us any eye contact even though we were less than a foot away from them. 5 minutes of standing in front of them, we heard one of the hostesses say \"you need to stop taking in these people\" mind you it's only 11:30am.   Not a welcoming environment. All the hostesses rolled their eyes at all the customers waiting outside. I understand that the establishment was busy, the food in these pictures look amazing but that's something you expect when you know how popular this restaurant is. Don't take the job if you are going to roll your eyes at people that are waiting in the heat with their families. Left a bad taste in my mouth.  When I let the lady know that we checked in through Yelp, she said \"we don't do that\" and I proceeded to tell her that it's available on their Yelp page she yelled at me and said \"I don't know why Yelp thinks it can do that to us, but we don't do that here. It's going to be a long while before we can seat you.\" I walked out, this establishment will never have my business. There are plenty of places in the area that serve a great breakfast and brunch. This establishment does not deserve your business because of how they treat their customers.  Note: not kid friendly since you will have to wait 1 hour + outside, in the heat. Children will not do well with waiting that long. Also, I don't think their AC works. It's pretty warm inside.",

They were out of 2 of the mixers we wanted. We finally got our mimosas and continued to sit outside and wait.   After waiting for 40 minutes we were offered an outside table. We turned it down as we wanted an inside table. After 60 minutes of waiting (in addition to the 50 we waited on the waitlist) our name was called and we were brought to an outside table. When we told the hostess we had already been offered an outside table and were waiting for inside she told us no one told her and this was what was available as everyone inside had finished and paid but hadn't left.   We ordered mimosas and now they were out of 3 of the mixers. Sat outside for 20 minutes before ordering. Food came quickly and was good. Took another 20 to get our check and pay.

It does have outside seating, however, during their rush hour, be prepared to be on an extra long hour waitlist.

Then we asked to move and they did, but to a seat in between windows with only a bottom cushion. I would consider having some sort of back support in that seating area towards the back windows facing the road. Overall, not the greatest first impression of the restaurant.   Waiter/Waitresses: Besides the whole seating shenanigans, the service and interaction with the waitresses/waiters were extremely pleasant! They kept our waters high, checked up on us but not overdoing it, and were helpful in regards to what to choose on the menu.  Food: two words... HELLA GOOD. I ordered the Chile Verde and that pork belly was beyond words. The white chocolate French toast was perfect and the jelly on top was like the icing on the cake! My partner got the duck omelette, and he was a huge fan too. The lattes were so cute and unique depending on which one you ordered, so it made the experience a bit more fun!!! Overall, you may see me back there next week!!!",

The main problem here is that they said we had to go at the end of the waiting list for the table and would not honor us waiting there the whole time.",

I had the tacos huevos. I wanted to love them, but they were surprisingly bland, even with the extra salsa I requested. The cook must have forgotten salt and seasonings which is sad because they could have been so good! My husband had the country benedict and it was far more flavorful. We both liked his choice much better.   Even though my dish wasn't the best, I'm definitely interested in going back to try something else due to the quality of the food and the good customer service.",

The best part of this place was the staff, thank you to our waiter Maria and the food runner Lilly with the speedy clean up and assistance!!!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Henderson / Green Valley. Everything I've tasted on their menu has been spectacular. They have plenty of options for your sweet (strawberry shortcake French toast, or peaches and cream pancake) or savory (croque madame or tacos huevos) cravings, and they offer gluten-free versions of many of their dishes. Their Mexican Hot Chocolate with torch-blown marshmallows is as beautiful as it is delicious (see attached photo), and their \"Social Bucket\" of champagne (one bottle, your choice of juice, and as many glasses as you can fill) is the perfect way to start off your meal with friends.   A warning: this place is ALWAYS busy on the weekends. However, you can join the waiting list through Yelp! so that you do not have to physically be at the restaurant in order to get in line. If you use this feature, though, you are still required to check in with the hostess once you arrive. My only complaint with this is that they often times give you a 20-ish minute window of time for when you will be seated, and you are seated towards the end of that window (if not a bit beyond it) more often than not. But that's what happens when you decide to dine at one of the best breakfast / brunch places in town (and it sure beats not getting on the waiting list at all, and having to wait for a full hour or more to be seated)!",

I on the other hand had a tough decision on what to eat because everything  looked awesome ( reason why he didn't complain right away)  * main squeeze complained to hostess and chef/manager/owner? overheard and came to our table and genuinely apologize for the miscommunication and took care of us- a big plus in my book.   * my food had lots of flavor and my shorty Benny was super tender.

    "text": "Where do I begin with this place! Kitchen Table has been on a raider for quite some time now; everyone was raving about it. Now, it's not a restaurant in my neighborhood so I mentally had to prepare myself for the 'road trip'. And needless to say more, it was well worth it!  I got there around 1PM and was not anticipating a wait; 30 mins. They had a nice patio with enough seating for the ones waiting to indulge on some deliciousness. I started getting antsy & made my way inside. To the left is a cute little walk up 'cafe' I would call it. It's for the on the good quick grabs. Loved his concept! I ordered a guava mimosa to enjoy while I waited. Fresh baked goods were also displayed on the counter. My only concern for this is that it was open. Customers are constantly walking up and hovering over these goods. The least we would want is germs and debris falling on them. My only recommendation is to cover them with those cute bulbous glass covers.   Now the food! Mind you I have been very excited to try this place out so I was constantly looking at pictures on Yelp and IG. Everything looked amazing! We were the 2nd table from the kitchen and joked that it was the worse table; I changed my mind on my order about 3x. Everything that was coming out was perfectly displayed and approved from one of the head Chefs. Our starter was the bacon and egg shooter; something like a deviled egg. It's was perfect. So much flavor in one bite! My entree consisted of the Pork Belly Bene. My mouth was bursting with flavor in ever bite! Now if you are not a fan of spicy, I suggest to steer away from this dish. The pork was so tender! The hollandaise was probably the best I have had yet & and I love my bennies. You could taste every ingredient and nothing was over powerful. I also was able to sneak in a bite of the Social Burger; amazing! The meat was perfect cooked and didn't skimp you out on the patty. Every bite stayed in tacked allowing the bread to never flatten.   Being in the hospitality industry I am more aware to customer service than one should be. This place nailed it. Everything was perfect from me first walking in to leaving. The presence of the chefs was always a nice touch. It's something you don't see that often in a neighborhood restaurant.   I'll be back next weekend! I already have the tacos on my mind.",

The Chef Pedro came out to greet us to see how the food was, he was really nice. Chef Pedro did a great job with menu! Melanie came over to greet us as well. Melanie was so sweet and spoke to us a little bit about herself and how she started with Kitchen Table. Overall the experience was memorable.",

    "text": "Great breakfast spot! We ordered the regular french toast, veggie hash, huevos tacos, drip coffee, and a cappuccino.  French toast - absolutely delicious! They use brioche and it was cooked to perfection, along with vanilla infused whipped cream! Was probably the best french toast I've ever had. When I order french toast, I sometimes taste the oil they cook it in. That was not the case here!  Veggie hash - absolutely delicious! They veggies were cooked just right, and weren't oily. I would've liked it if they added more spices/flavors to the veggies, but it was nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix.  Tacos huevos - also good! They look small but they're filling. Again, a little spice (salt & pepper maybe?) would've helped, but thankfully we had 3 hot sauce options.  Drip coffee - this is the reason for only 4 stars, not 5. I'm sorry, but the coffee was not good! I've had better coffee on planes (s/o to Lufthansa). Maybe I should've asked for dark roast? If you're a breakfast place, y'all have to invest in good coffee! I don't want to drink panera coffee. Cappuccino - good, but nothing to write home about.   Ambiance was nice and homey. Trendy without being too hipster. Loved the mugs and plates!   All in all, best breakfast in Henderson. Would definitely recommend!",

For a restaurant that has only been in business a few months, this place was crazy busy for their Sunday brunch (okay, it was Valentine's but I still think that it would have been busy nonethless.)   When we went to put our names on the list, the wonderful smells that were in the restaurant made us stay no matter how long we would have to wait.    The food was delicious (Monte Cristo, crepes, egg shooters, and french toast) and I wish I was local so I could try about 10 other things on the menu.  They use great ingredients and plated things nicely.  It was very well prepared and tasted delicious.  Very reasonably priced also!",

    "text": "I love everything about this place. The chef is just the coolest guy, really makes you feel like he's having you over to his home for brunch. Adorable decor, very high energy. Usually a short a wait for a table, but I promise it's worth it. I have loved most of what I've had - which is almost everything on the menu. Favorites: croque madame, the benedicts, and the pancakes (especially bananas foster). Only thing I disliked was the donut sandwich. Sounded like a great idea as I imagined an egg sandwich on crisp, sweet beignets...but it ended up being on regular glazed donuts and topped with a salad tossed in vinaigrette, which ended being really, really weird. So I'd stay away from that. I also wish they'd serve fresh squeezed OJ, even if I have to pay a pretty penny for it, it would be so lovely with their breakfast. Anyway, you must try Kitchen Table. You'll love it!",

The greeter came back after 10 minutes to say Neither flavors are available so I asked for mango and another 10 minutes went by and our server came for the first time to say there's no mango either.  Ok so we had peach it was on and I ordered a creek brulee latte. After another 15 minutes and we asked to order the avocado crab dip.  Our coffee finally came and then our sever said there's no dip available so we ordered crab cakes.   About 10 minutes later we were there's no crab cakes either so we were brought empanadas.  They were ok.  We ordered the white chocolate French toast and tacos.  The tacos were kind of boring but fine and we waited for new silverware so by the time we tasted it it was ice cold.  We were there for almost two hours because the service was so incredibly slow. Nicole was nice but overwhelmed and we asked several times for the same items. The inside was so outrageously loud we could hear the blenders from the kitchen they were ear piercing.  They were out of so any food items at 1245 they're open til 3pm.  I don't know where the manager was because we never met them but I will never go back.  This experience was ludacris.",

Which makes no sense, in that case why offer that service.  Anyhow we showed her on our phone that is was called in.  She told us we still had to wait an hour.  The service was horrible from the minute we walked in the door to when we walked out.   All 6 of us agreed the food wasn't good and we all were going to write a review. Sandra",

I got the monkey bread both times and it is so yummy, gooey and warm.  The decor is beautiful inside and so is the outdoor seating!   The second time around I got the American breakfast. I asked for extra crispy potatoes and what I got was not very crispy. I don't know how soggy they would have been if I didn't ask for extra crispy.  I got my eggs scrambled and they were weirdly smelly, not sure if they use real eggs.  The toast I got with it was the best part and super yummy. But, the breakfast as a whole was not the best.   Another con is that their water glasses kind of smell like \"wet dog\".  The first time I was here we asked them to get different waters and the second glass was somewhat better. The second time I was here, the glasses smelled the same and I just used a straw.   Pro: great seating, great decor and decently good food, awesome monkey bread  Con: smelly glasses, smelly eggs, mediocre potatoes  Next time, I would probably try a different spot then return.",

Classic French omelet topped with duck Mac and cheese. Not quite what I expected but was pleasantly surprised. Their potatoes are killer. Small diced potatoes with bell peppers. Seasoned perfectly.  Wife had country Benedict. Country fried steak on top of homemade buttermilk biscuits topped with a cayenne hollandaise and poached egg. Very flavorful but had a little too much heat for Carey to eat it all. I prefer my poached egg to have the yolk a little more runny than it was.   Emi had a single pancake that wad the entire size of the plate. Topped with powdered sugar and a sweet whipped butter.   They have plenty of seating and also outdoor seating with cabanas. Really great place. Can't wait to try the French toast I saw on other guests' plates the next time I'm there.",

In the waiting area there's a coffee shop!!!!!! It was worth waiting when you can get coffee. So I got a macchiato. It was good.  We were seated and the menu was pretty diverse. I'm like caviar? Lol I'll get the chilaquiles. The chilaquiles were delicious, way better than lindo Michoacan. This are my favorite and not willing to try anything else since how amazing they are. We also tried the breakfast taquitos which were spicy and amazing. The buttermilk pancakes are best in class. The best pancakes I ever had. We had a guava mimosa and a black berry mimosa.   Overall, Amazing brunch! My favorite brunch spot in town. It's worth the drive and the waiting sacrifice.",

The food overall was good.  I ordered the chilaquiles as I'm a huge fan. And although the were good, they weren't the best as they were missing something.  That something is onions.  I feel that the onions would balance the stronger chili taste.  I told this to my boyfriend and friend who also tasted it and agreed.    The hot chocolate was really tasty and the roasted marshmallows on top made it look extra special.    The portions are big, so if you're hungry you're not going to leave disappointed.",

We got there late in the day and they were out of pastries so we ordered the gluten free sweet bread. The strawberry jam that came with it was fantastic! I wish they bottled it and sold it because I would buy it! The bread was surprisingly great too. I had the croque madame. Perfection. I hear their coffee is great but didn't try that. Instead went with mimosas. Only downfall is they don't have a liquor license so they only serve beer and wine (no bloody Mary's). Other than that it's a cute and great choice for brunch!",

We have since tried a new breakfast spot and have gone there for several weeks so had been a couple Months since we have been here. We decided to go today as it was one of our favorites but they have gone completely down hill. Issues:  We typically order the monkey bread; today it was hard and cold inside, we sent it back and it came back warm but still hard inside, almost stale.  My two month old was diagnosed with a milk/soy allergy so I have been unable to have any dairy in my diet, I asked the waitress what they had as far as dairy free options, she basically looked at me and said \"everything we make has milk in it do you want me to ask if there is soy in our food now or later?\" Normally when I ask a restaurant about allergies; the chef will actually come out and talk to me or they will at least attempt to offer other options.  Their espresso machine was down, waiting for a part; I guess that's not their fault My mom has a gluten intolerance; Keep in mind this is Saturday morning; they are out of their gluten free bread???  My husband always orders the pork belly Benny and he said it tasted awful today.  Not sure if they have new management, but we were very disappointed. Sad but we will not be returning.",

However, kitchen table is phenomenal and makes you forget about the places you were once forced to eat at. I come here often and have never had a bad meal. The strawberry french toast is to die for. I've never had a better snickerdoodle latte anywhere else or in general & the staff is friendly. The chef personally serves your food to the table which is sweet and so professional!",

    "text": "I arrived here at about 9:30am on a Saturday, and there was a good amount of people and a 30-45 minute wait. I've been wanting to try this place for a while so I decided to wait.  The wait was 36 minutes.    While I waited, there's a counter where they're selling pastries, coffee, and other brunch beverages.  I got the blueberry lemon muffin and a latte.  The latte I thought was a pricey $4.50.  A lil disappointed on the order because it took almost 10 minutes just to get my latte.  I also told them not so hot and to add 2 packets of raw sugar, but that didn't happen.    Luckily the weather was nice and there was plenty of seating outside.  This is the area you sit before being seated inside.  I took the time to enjoy my coffee, muffin, and to browse through the menu while I waited.    36 minutes after I put my name down I was seated.  The interior looked cute.  Not too hipsterish.  I was seated in the back at a table that had a plush couch looking seat.  It was super comfy.  I really dig the interior.  Their ACT ceiling has an interesting look to it.    I started with some bacon shooters.  This is pretty much a deviled egg with mayo, jalapeno, and bacon pieces.  Not much of a fan on this because of the mayo overload.  Still good, but not my favorite during this brunch session.    Chilaquiles came with tortilla strips, pork, black beans on the bottom, cheese, sauce, and an over easy fried egg on top.  It looked so good that the table next to me asked what it was.  Not only did it look good, but it was good!    I had the smoked salmon with quail egg, caviar, and a small blini pancake.  This was my favorite!  Not your traditional breakfast food for sure.  The smoked salmon had the perfect flavor to it, which did not involve loads of saltiness flavor.  The quail eggs were friend over easy.  Caviar gave a simple salt flavor to the dish.    I think I'd like to try their Foie menu next time.    This was a unique dining experience, and I'll be sure to come back soon!",

I sat there for ages with my menu in my hand waiting for the server to come and take my order. When he finally did come back it was to bring their food (which I didn't realise they had already ordered because all the menus were still on the table). I waited until everyone had their meal and tried to order a small appetizer. I was told that the kitchen had closed at 9:00. I don't understand a server who ignores a person who is literally holding the menu the whole time and doesn't tell them the kitchen is closing. I was in the restaurant for a full 40 minutes before I even got a drink. I am sure the food is fine, but the service on Sunday May 20th was terrible.",

Walked in and I smelt something a bit off in the outside waiting area. Came in & the hostess didn't acknowledge me... ok, she's busy. I stand in front of her for a moment but after awhile I decide to wait near the wall. People walk in after me and she gets their information before me. It's her job to know who's been waiting for help first. I go over to say something and another employee who clearly has had too many coffees just walks up and starts talking to her, interrupting me and cutting me off when I spoke. And it was to talk about another guests' sweater. Rude.   I walk in the outside waiting area after learning how the long the wait is to inform my party and they were standing next to full trash cans. No wonder it smelled outside. I know it's busy and everything but full, smelly trash cans outside are not attractive to your guests. Decided we are going to bail and just get coffees. I go back inside to order and I'm yet again waiting forever for someone to acknowledge me near the coffee machine. A lady finally takes my order and I get 2 coffees for over $8. That's a bit much but when in Rome I thought. Our barista did a good job on the drinks, we enjoyed them.  As I wait, I take in my surroundings and the place is just dirty in my opinion. There are multiple people dealing with money then going behind the bar making mimosas, the counter is sticky, the cookies and what's left of the pastries are all uncovered in a very busy area where people are talking over the food constantly, my shoes were making a noise as if it were sticking to the floor. In combination on that and how it smelt outside, I won't be making a return here.",

Starting with a sprawling menu intended to gauge local tastes and since curtailing the offerings to focus on favorites while also allowing for creativity despite a small kitchen, it was once again with a great showing of hospitality that hosts, severs and chefs greeted diners within the jammed-packed space now generating 45 minute waits as patio season is about to begin, and although wait times may seem excessive to those used to chains the quality of craftsmanship and expediting remains remarkable even when compared to the best of what is offered nationwide - whether Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, or even trendy Brooklyn.  Stating that the new menu is meant to make things seasonal while also giving diners the chance to experience novel ingredients in ways that they may have never conceived, it was with carte blanche deferred to the Kitchen that the morning's family-style experience was undertaken and kicking off with pastries the new menu sees a focus on American Classics, the Pumpkin Donut and Pear Fritter so lightly fried that they may as well have been baked while the Monkey Bread remains a city-wide standard bearer, the Social Pecan Roll tasting great, the current appearance admittedly a bit deceiving.  Impressed by the buttery Pecan Loaf plus Cookies with a crisp rim and soft center, but finding the Berry-based Muffins to have regressed to the dryness experienced early in the restaurant's existence, menu based items got underway with a pile of three buttermilk flapjacks shellacked in housemade peanut butter plus jam and with even those who tend to avoid \"sweet breakfasts\" already smiling another cup of coffee helped clear the palate before veering savory, the vegetal Broccoli Tort eating something like an egg-souffle or fluffy fritatta with saline cheesy notes underlying vibrant Sweet Pepper Coulis and gently smoked Salmon.  Presenting a few new spins on the breakfast sandwiches made famous by a clown and Golden Arches the kitchen next sent forth the Egg Mac Kitchen and with the crispy English Muffin already an upgrade on the original Chef Nunez raises the bar further through the addition of spicy Guacamole plus charred Corn to a nicely fried egg with a bit of levity added by tangy Crema.  Claiming that he was generally unaware of the Avocado Toast trend run amok in LA, a clear sign of a man spending too much time working and not enough traveling or dining out, Nunez's take on the modern classic slightly misses the Veg-Friendly point by adding Poached Eggs and Bacon Vinaigrette, but proving all the better for it and thus actually quite stunning it was perhaps more expected that the follow-up citrusy Strawberry Short Cake French Toast quickly nudged its way into the spotlight with soft layers of  Angel Food Cake happily sopping up cloudy Whipped Cream and lightly sweetened Strawberry Gastrique.  At this point just showing off, some at the table already starting to claim satiety while others more appropriately peered at the ope kitchen in anticipation of what was to come next, Antonio strayed slightly from the menu to present the Pork Belly Benne and with house-smoked pork mixing with beans, masa, and salsa the heat was raised just a touch through the addition of tangy Guajillo chili but still kept in check with creamy Bearnaise, the overall composition appropriately-deemed a table favorite.  Rounding out the meal with two more plates, the White Chocolate French Toast undoubtedly the sort of thing that spoke to  holiday often celebrated with sweetness, it was as a grand finale that Kitchen Table sent forth a second 'breakfast sandwich,' the Foie Mac Muffin not just featuring a roasted slice of liver but also seeing the bun itself soaked in the pan jus with a topping of tender Short Rib and Bearnaise offering up plenty of richness even before rupturing the soft-poached egg.  At this point seeing the endorsement of nearly every media outlet in town, a great thing for the restaurant but a growing concern for those looking to walk-in on a weekend, the only question remaining for Chefs Chavez and Nunez is how long the Buzz will last, a question each seem happy to confront with the sort of menu that never seems to for innovation and a commitment to quality that provides plenty of reasons to come back.",

    "text": "We have been trying to go here for a few weeks, but every Sunday when we go, the wait is an hour, and we never have time to wait. Today, we were told the wait was 45 minutes, and decided to be patient. While we were waiting for our table, we stood in line for the coffee/pastry bar where we ordered a latte and mocha. It took us about 20 minutes to get through the line and get our drinks, which was a little on the long side in my opinion.   Service: All of the staff we interacted with were very friendly. Our server was attentive and helpful. I asked for hot sauce, and she brought a few, pointed out her \"favorite,\" and it was the best hot sauce I have ever had. I will need to go but some from the store soon.   Environment: So a \"social eatery\" apparently means \"we don't have much space, and don't use our outside patio space well, so we are going to cram as many tables in a room as we legally can, and have multiple parties sit at the single long table.\" That part didn't bother me in any significant way, but we kept laughing throughout our meal because we felt like we could hear every word of every table's conversation in the place because we were so close to each other. There were also A LOT of screaming children in there when we were there, and in such a small place it was rather disruptive. But we have come to accept that parents who live near the Green Valley area are the worse type of parents out there, and let their overly privileged children run around screaming and putting their mouths on every table/surface in sight (yeah that happened, with two different kids while we were there). My final note on environment that I mentioned in my picture, the patio is not a well designed use of space. I could easily fit 15-20 more seats in the sectioned off area, hire 1-2 more servers and reduce the ridiculous wait times here and get more customers served. I just do not understand why that area was set up that way at all (it almost looks like they ran out of money for furniture and just gave up as 50%+ of the patio is just empty space).   Food/Drinks: The drinks from the coffee bar were decent, not the best I've ever had, and both were disappointingly room temperature. The mimosa flavor options were pretty impressive. We loved the prickly pear! Both of our entrees were really good. Relatively simple dishes packed with a ton of flavor. The food made the overall wait and environment downfalls worth the trip. Of important note, the prices were also reasonable given what we were served. It would be easy for them to charge another 2-3 dollars per dish and get away with it, but they don't, and that is appreciated.   We'll probably be back, but probably later when the wait isn't so ridiculous and the children are all at home napping....  2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge: #30.",

We were seated shortly after arriving. I ordered the vegetable sandwich. More bread than vegetables and very difficult to eat. Unfortunately the vegetables did not have much flavor and there was no type of dressing or cheese on the sandwich. My one daughter ordered the taquitos, which she said were dry. The other daughter ordered the Turkey BLT which she said was just ok.  I am looking forward to going back and trying something else on their menu!",

Look, if you are looking for basic breakfast that you get at \"basic\" breakfast joints, then you're probably only in it for the huge portions sizes and you don't truly appreciate good quality food, put together whole heartedly.. Kitchen Table brings you a wide variety of traditional breakfast and lunch with their own twist.. Quality food, tasty dishes, portion sizes were perfect and not overwhelming, which is how breakfast should be.. Staff is personable, polite and fun. Chef Antonio is very friendly and I never saw a smile leave his face. He loves what he does and that's enough for me.. I plan on being her once a week;) Did I mention the DONUTS... Oh my gawd, the donuts! If you're looking for the same old boring breakfast stuff, you won't find it here, the food alone gets me excited, every time. If you've had the same hairstyle since 1986, Kitchen Table is not for you, unless you're ready for a change. The right people will love you guys! Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "Went here based on reviews.  Not disappointed and we will return, but...  Pros:  Very nice ambiance - windows that offer natural lighting indoors, outdoor seating available, attention to detail (ceiling, tables, cloth napkins, attractive dishware, etc.).  Big menu with both sweet and savory options.  Emphasis is on pork.  Friendly server and busser.  Cons:  Lots of people were waiting for tables even when there were many sitting clean and empty.  Server was very friendly and attentive during the middle of our experience - from ordering through getting our food and a coffee refill - but we were a bit neglected when we first arrived and again while waiting for our check (which we finally had to get up and ask for).  Other details:   1. The menu has a lot on it, but if you want meat, you'd better like pork.  Bacon, ham, pulled pork, pork sausage, etc.  Granted, we were told it's their specialty (and it was good, just not what we normally eat).  Why is there no alternative meat?  I think there were a couple vegetarian dishes, but those options were pretty limited and I don't think I'd recommend this restaurant to my vegetarian friends.  Even my potato soup had bacon in it.  It seems weird that they don't offer a chicken or veggie sausage options, at least.    2. The hostess had a really hard time getting people seated.  We arrived during what we thought must have been the tail end of an early rush (just before 8:00).  A few people were waiting up front but we could see enough open tables for everyone, so I was confident that we would be seated shortly.  It wasn't too long, but it also wasn't like the hostess seated a party then came right back and seated the next one.  She seemed to hesitate and wander around looking uncertain about what she was supposed to do next.  When she took us back, she was going \"Um...\" and looking left and right and hesitating at each empty table we passed.  She finally selected the farthest one for us and I didn't think about her again until we were leaving.  As we ate, I made a note to myself that we should come after 8:00 next time because it seemed a lot less busy.  (There were as many as five empty tables around us at any given time and each seemed to sit empty for a pretty long time.)  However, strike that thought!... when we left I saw a large number of people inside and outside the front door waiting for tables.  Maybe there weren't enough other staff and they would have just been behind on taking care of customer after they were seated rather than before, but whatever the reason, it looked like a big missed opportunity for the restaurant to handle a lot more customers.  Finally, I saw the review that noted that it was difficult to get seating for more than two.  I observed quite a few tables of four and six.  Again, that's a matter of the restaurant planning properly.  Most of the tables seem to be for two, but were pushed together to seat more.  At least it appeared that they have that figured out now.  3. Value:  Prices are quite fair considering there is attention to detail in both the food and the ambiance.  I think you could spend a lot if you order sides, but I had a combo of empanadas and potato soup that together amounted to $13.50, which is about the same as a lot of the other entrees and, I think, reasonable.  And the empanadas alone would have been plenty (I took more than half of that dish home as leftovers.)  If service/seating issues were resolved, based on the rest of our experience, I would give 5 stars.",

The food came out to us in an okay time but the food was just that, okay. Not worth the price at all. Awkward blend of flavours in both dishes we ordered and we didn't go for the cheap plates either. We finished our food and not once did our server come by during that time to check on us. Instead we watched him talk to the staff (girls) in the kitchen. We were done with our food for 20 minutes and still no one to be seen...except for the manager who was very attentive to the table next to us for some reason. We tried flagging hostesses and servers down and we're met with nothing. Finally I had to hand a busser my credit card so I could gtfo. The server finally came with my card and check and never even apologized. Nothing about this place made me want to come back. Very disappointed.",

Everything is fresh, all baked goods made in house and it tastes like a home cooked meal; that is if you lived with an excellent chef . From the sandwiches to the pancakes, waffles and muffins, the food is just so tasty and the flavor combinations are excellent . This is sure to become a hit, make sure to make reservations and plan for some time to chat as dishes come out. There's a real home feel to this place, and it's a great meeting place or family spot . The food rivals any expensive restaurant at the strip . The foie gras is the best I've had in Vegas . All the ingredients, even the syrups are selected for high quality and taste. Truly a great find and a must try, you'll want to go back and taste everything on the menu. Come with friends and family so you can share more and prepare to leave stuffed . The chef was also so warm and inviting, managing to converse with every table which I thought added a great personal touch .",

I counted 5 different servers outside and not a single one acknowledged us. Now im pissed. I ask to be moved inside. They say give me 5 min. We sit out there another 10. Waitress says what do ypu want to order? Ummmm im moving inside. Ok and then I had to go back in and remind them I am moving inside? The rest of the experience was average inside and very slow staff.

    "text": "I almost hate to review this place because it is so good and is getting so popular--but it deserves the credit.  The food is different and delicious!  The servers are friendly and know a lot about the food.  If you want something unique, try it (but it also serves regular breakfast fare)  Everything I have ordered tastes like it could be served in the fanciest French restaurant rather than a neighborhood place.  My only comment would be get a bigger restaurant, you are going to need it.  Luckily there is a large outdoor area so on a nice day, the size of the place can double.  Awesome food and service!",

We waited nearly 2 hours and after a little frustration we were seated. The hostess is very clueless to customer service. That being said, this place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I wish I had tried the jalapeno bacon but now I have something to go back for! Adam, our server was on his game 100%! We felt very much like family! He talked to our 6 year old son asking him how he liked his food! Javier, the owner let us bend his ear about the hostess and cared! Chef Antonio, the food is beyond Excellent! The plating and presentation looked like it came of the cover of a fine dining magazine! I was so excited to eat I forgot to take pictures! My wife ordered the breakfast taquitos, mother in law got the chorizo omelette, son got strawberry short cake French toast, and I ordered the Smoked pork belly benedict! WE WILL BE BACK! THANK YOU JAVIER AND STAFF!!",

We sat outside because it was very crowded in and the wait would have been long which wasn't a problem even though it was very hot outside we waited 22 minutes after placing out drink order to get out drinks as a matter of fact I had to go inside to approach our server by the name of Raphael.. the server had great hair but the service was terrible. We had no problem with our food even though there were condiments that we had requested that we didn't get and had to wait a long time before we were able to get those things. Our drinks had water down pretty much to nothing we had to wait a long time before we were able to get refills. The service overall was just horrible. We will definitely go back but I will make sure we are not seated in his area. I do recommend this restaurant I just do not recommend this server",

I had the meatless which caught my attention with poached eggs, fried tomatoes, avocado, with potatoes and the other typical eggs Benedict stuff (just realized there wasn't any hollandaise sauce! Definitely ask for it). Wife had a tradition breakfast; eggs over easy, sausage, potatoes, toast. Both of us basically said it was an 'eh' experience.   To begin with, the portions were 'foo foo' small. I've never seen smaller slices of avocado (literally 1\" length slices. Had no idea avocados could be that small), thin English muffins, and thin fried tomatoes. The country potatoes had absolutely no flavor and were mush. Even salt couldn't save them and I left most uneaten.  Again, wife was unimpressed but I can't get into detail about why as she didn't share the details beyond that.   I get that this place is trying to be trendy and a boutique type breakfast/brunch place but, leaving 4 and 5 star reviews without the product quality is a disservice to those who rely on Yelp to find exceptional dining experiences.",

    "text": "Best brunch in henderson for certain. I have been coming here since they opened. There are a couple of reasons why I have rated them a 3/5 stars. First, the indoor area is not adequate in size to the amount of traffic they bring in. Because of this there is ALWAYS a wait. Second, they took away the ability to check in on yelp so that we could show up shortly before the time of our check in. When I questioned the hostess about that, she was extremely snarky. She said that is wasn't fair to the people who were waiting at the restaurant. I am not sure how that is not fair considering the fact that ANYONE could use the feature. This is the second time I have had to walk away from this restaurant and head across the parking lot to there competitors. (Who remember my name, my kids, and my order.) Final",

While waiting another couple walked in and were seated immediately, which was a little odd.  Finally we were seated! It took 15 min to get our coffee ordered and other 15 min to get that coffee. When our coffee came the waitress took our order and we sat and waited...and waited....and waited...and waited.  The restaurant filled up, people were seated, and food came for them. However, our food was nowhere to be found. The waitress came to us and said that she'd check on the food and we waited again.  Eventually we got up, offered to pay for our coffee, and left.  I'm not going to get up and make a scene, but I can't be at a restaurant for a total of an hour an a half and only be seated and served coffee with a distant promise of food. It's hard to satiate the hunger of a wife and 9 year old with that.",

    "text": "I'm not usually one to leave a bad review, I prefer to spread positivity. But I feel something needs to be said about my experience.   Someone immediately took our drink orders, but then they took about 15 minuets just to bring one beverage. I ordered the delicious looking Bloody Mary I saw in the photo on here, but they informed me it's just a \"bloody beer\" which is beer and tomato juice for $8. And for a \"cafe\" type place to be out of espresso is not cool, but amy husband settled for basic bitch coffee which never came, even after the long wait. We had to remind them to bring his drink.   After the already 15 min wait for one drink, the wait for the food was an additional 30+ minuets and the restaurant wasn't even that busy.   I ordered the taco plate which was $8 for three very small street tacos with No meat included. Just egg and potato. I asked them if I could order some meat tacos, and they said sure, and added a very minimal amount of chorizo to my tacos. They did not mention an up charge. It brought the mini street tacos up to $11.   My husbands eggs Benedict came cold and was nothing special for the premium price.  I had to change my daughters diaper and there wasn't even a baby changer in the restroom, so I had a very dangerous and messy time trying to change her on the dirty, wet sink.  When it was time to pay the bill, one of our literally 4 different servers apologized for the \"long wait\" but did not offer any sort of consolation to make it right.   Can't believe we drove all the way here from 10 miles away to try this place. Don't be fooled by the pictures. It is nothing great and I leave very disappointed.   Usually when a bad review is posted an owner will reach out with a response, an apology or an attempt to try and make things right. It's been a month and still nothing. Guess this place really doesn't care?  Best advice: You guys have plenty of children and babies dining in. You provide high chairs, so obviously it's not an adults only restaurant. Install a baby changer in the restrooms! I don't want anybody else to experience what I did.",

    "text": "My wife and I got burnt out with all the overpriced, trendy restaurants in Vegas so we decided to venture out to nearby cities for other options.  Henderson area seemed to have several good restaurants, and the location seemed family friendly, so we decided to check out this place as our first option.  I was rather amazed with the food here.  Even compared to many of the breakfast places in OC and LA, I thought this place was better than most of them.  I always have a tough time eating out for breakfast because traditional breakfast items are extremely boring to me.  I didn't find too many boring items here.  Almost everything on the menu looked good, and this place did a great job making enough tweaks and twists on traditional items to make them interesting.  Even the maple syrup at this place isn't typical.  It uses Noble brand maple syrup, which is matured in charred oak barrel with a little bit of bourbon.  It has a rather distinct, robust taste compared to other maple syrups.  I had a tough time deciding what to order because I wanted to order at least 70% of the items on the menu.  I eventually narrowed it down and went with Monkey Bread, Peaches and Cream Pancakes, and Shorty Benedict.  The Monkey Bread seems to be the most popular item here because almost every table ordered one.  It's a simple bread glazed with salted caramel and cinnamon sugar.  It's served warm on a cast iron skillet.  At first bite it kind of reminded me of a cinnamon bun, but more dense and less sweet (due to lack of icing).  I didn't think it was mind-blowing or anything to have an orgasm over, but still very good.  I definitely would recommend this to all first time visitors.    Peaches and Cream Pancakes were simply delicious. My wife said it was the best pancakes she ever had.  I thought this was going to be too sweet and rich, but it was actually just right.  There was enough sweetness but certainly not overwhelming.  It was good even without any syrup, but I still poured a little bit on, just so I can experience what Noble brand syrup tastes like.    Shorty is a braised short rib Benedict, which comes with poached eggs, red wine reduction, and hollandaise on English muffin.  Eggs were poached perfectly and short rib was very tender.    This place also has a decent selection of beer, wine, mimosas, and few other alcoholic beverages.  I didn't see one on the menu but I saw some people drinking Bloody Mary, so there may be other alcoholic beverages not listed on the menu.  The restaurant is difficult to see from the parking lot because it's located diagonally on the corner.  Just look for Shabu Shabu Paradise, which is located next to this place.    This place is pretty popular around here.  We came little before 11 a.m. on a Monday and had to wait about half hour for our table. Luckily the food came out fairly quickly once we were seated.  Service was friendly and attentive.",

I always start with the basics:  1) The cook on a over medium egg.  2) The cook on the bacon.  3) The taste of the potatoes.  All were perfect. I have been at 5 star hotels that could not get the cook on an egg correct. Rittenhouse in Philly, 5 star restaurant that I gave a 1 star review to for a broken yoke. Lot No. 3 in Bellevue, WA known for their Eggs Benedict and the eggs were cooked solid with a broken hollindaise. 1 star,  Again, perfection.  I ordered a side of the gravy for a taste. OMG.

The Chiliquiles here is amazing, I had the one with pork belly and scrambled eggs. It's probably the best chiliquiles I've had in town. My friend and I also shared the monkey bread, which is super sweet and delicious, I can see why people go crazy for it here. However if you're not a big fan of sweets for breakfast, I'd leave it to the sweet tooths to devour this dish.  The service was great and all the wait staff was friendly. They have an assortment of unique mimosas available, including blackberry, guava, peach, and my favorite, prickly pear.",

    "text": "Decided to explore the brunch scene in this corner of Henderson. Decided to give Kitchen Table a try! We got there around 11:30AM on a Saturday morning. We had 5 people and we were seated in about 5-minutes. They have a variety of seating designs include a community table/seats which is always a cool concept to bring people together for BRUNCH!  Glancing over the menu-they have quite the variety of items, ranging from their delicious eggs benedicts, avo toast, gluten free bread dessert options and other breakfast entrees & sides.   I was tempted to order one of their hot chocolate options with a floating marshmallow, the temptation was real! I hope ya'll try it out because the photos look great.   I opted for the Shorty Eggs Benedict. Everyone in my group nearly had an eggs benedict: salmon, pork belly, country style, meatless. It sort of just worked out that way!   The food came out fairly fast. The eggs were poached perfectly, the portion was perfect. The short ribs were delicious. A little sweet but the egg and hollandaise evened that out for me.   I got to try their empanadas as well, it was slightly spicy but in a good way. The service was friendly and fast. They seemed busy but she answered all our questions and gave suggestions as well!  Service 5/5. Food 5/5. Friendliness 5/5. Space Design 5/5. Love the concept with community tables.",

I took a friend here back in November (Thanksgiving week) to be exact and wanted to order their famous monkey bread, but was told the baker quit on them and couldn't serve anything that had to be baked.  We said ok and went on to order our food.  Our lattes arrived cold and the service was absolutely horrible.   Today we went back to celebrate Father's Day.  I called and made reservations for 5 over a week ago, so they anticipate our arrival.  We arrive early and we were seated right away, which I was happy about.  We again order lattes and they arrive timely.  However, our food took over 50 minutes to arrive.  I had my 6 year old who is now starving.  Again, the waitress tells us they are down a cook today and we we were 3 in line.  I laughed as that was the exact thing 6 months ago.  I don't know if this place is under new ownership, but will definitely not return.  I didn't mind paying for the overly priced breakfast, but we expected much better service.  Lattes were ok, food quality for the price is below average and service is horrible.  Save your time, this is place has gone down hill.  So disappointing!",

The strawberries had this weird look to them (see photos) and I was told they are dipped in some sort of sugar solution. Either way they did not taste good and I returned it. The waitress was very friendly and accommodating (5 stars).  My friend had the hot chocolate which is made with milk chocolate and has marshmallows on top. She enjoyed it as well as her yoghurt parfait.  As for the ambiance, the tables were very close to each other and the bench was very low compared to the chair across. I felt very awkward sitting at the table like a child barely able to put my arms on the table while my friend sat across from me quite a bit higher. I felt like I needed a booster seat or pillow. It was also quite loud since the tables were so close to each other, which made it more difficult to have a conversation.  I'm giving 3 stars since I didn't enjoy my food even though the reviews and pictures gave me high hopes and the seat was awkward and low. I will probably give them another shot in the future and order a meal next time. Hopefully I'll be able to give more stars next time.",

    "text": "I rolled in solo on a Sunday morning. I had bookmarked Kitchen Table about a month prior, so I thought it would be good to swing by since I could add myself to the waitlist right from the Yelp app! I had spent the morning at Seven Magic Mountains and and needed some grub.   The place was packed, minus the Patio. I imagine that once summer comes to a close, the patio will be magical, but there were some breve would dining in the 105 degree heat. I was not so brave and ended up at a table inside against the wall. There were all kinds of groups-ladies brunch group, families, couples-so it a great location for any occasion.   Maria was my server and brought coffee and water right away. The menu is full of juicy and delicious treats that I wanted to try but I kept it simple and had a side of bacon with the Meatless Benedict. It sounded amazing, but I felt it was missing a bit of flavor. Salt perhaps? But there was none on the table and I didn't want to ask for it because you never know if it's an intentional choice by the chef. It came with a side of fruit and although I wished it had a bit more of a WOW factor in regards the flavor of Benedict, the fried green tomatoes gave a nice texture with the English muffin and hollandaise. Avocado addition was nice, but almost unnecessary.  The ambiance, service, and full choice of menu items is enough to bring me back to try more things. I won't be diving into the Meatless Benedict again, but you better believe that I'm going try the Monkey Bread that the table next to me ordered.",

We told her what we thought.  She didn't know what the green tomatoes were supposed to taste like?!?  And she said it was their 'version' of hollandaise.  No lemon taste whatsoever.   I sent mine back and left hungry. We sat outside.  The seats were torn up.  We had to climb over wires to get to our table.

    "text": "Now that I've been to Kitchen Table a few times I know that I need to upgrade them to a five star. My husband and I love this spot. We'd probably come here more often if they weren't so busy! I'm glad that a local spot is popular enough to generate a consistent wait on the weekends though. I would advise not arriving hangry since the wait can be around 45 minutes mid-morning and lunch time. There is a to go counter for pastry and coffee if you need food immediately.   Each time we visit I see improvements to the service. Our first visit wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. During my other three visits we've had great service.   At this point I've been able to sample many different drinks, pastries, and breakfast entrees. Wow! Everything I've had has been amazing. The monkey bread is to die for and enough for two to three people to split. The Chicken Fried Benedict is also crazy good. The chipotle gravy, flaky biscuits, fried goodness, and egg yolk are an explosion of flavor.   Kitchen Table is definitely an asset to the area. I'm lucky to have this spot so close to home for decadent weekend brunches!",

Today we came again...the espresso machine was broken so no honeycomb cappuccino. Then I ordered the oatmeal which sounded really good with candied pecans/nuts. I got watered down oatmeal with no candied anything. When I asked he said they were running low and brought me out 5 small pieces of something that looked like candied nut crumbs. When I asked for a little more brown sugar I got packets of turbinado sugar.  Not really brown sugar in my opinion.   The benches are all torn up and the place doesn't look like it's being maintained well.   It makes me sad because we used to come here every weekend and now it has changed so much I can't imagine coming back.   The mimosas are still good though.",

We reviewed the menu and we ordered the monkey bread as an appetizer.  We were a bit underwhelmed by this dish because it was served at best lukewarm  The monkey bread tasted fine but it would have been better if it had been served warmer.  My wife ordered pancakes with a side of bacon but not the jalapeno bacon.  I ordered the pork green chili with poached eggs.  My wife also ordered a mimosa and I ordered a cappuccino.  The meal itself was really good and we ate our fill.  My only suggestion here is to be sure the monkey bread is served warm.",

I informed the waiter that we have been told this before and I know that they keep some in the back. That is all I want for breakfast. He said he would go check for me.   The waiter never came back.  The other person with me was served with her breakfast and no one asked if I wanted anything else?   Your wait service found it appropriate to serve one person and not the other AND not ask any questions ???  No monkey bread and now my guest is eating without me ?!?!  Finally I flag down someone to get a menu while my guest is eating.  No one ever comes back to take my order and my guest finishes. I ended up going else were for breakfast.  While your service staff is quick to brag that the owners stole them from STK (and I really doubt that these people were stolen, these are obviously the rejects from STK), your what staff needs some serious training.   Also, just remove the MONKEY BREAD from your clipboard menu. If you don't have it at 11am on a Thursday, you really never have it. Don't try to lie to customers and say that people come and pre-order it at 7am.",

But this time while sitting outside the umbrella that was blocking the sun where I was sitting was moved to another table to leave me with a spotty shade from a palm tree. The table it was moved to now has 3 umbrellas. I am extremely fair skinned and burn in the matter of 10 minutes at this time of day in high UV rays that we have. It had the perfect amount of shade when we were seated otherwise we would've requested another table. Super inconsiderate of the individual to do this. And I'm wondering why the other table needs 3 umbrellas when there is only 5 people to a huge table? They are only using half of the large table.",

Took my wife to birthday breakfast this morning and was told to expect about a half hour wait. After 40 minutes my wife was told by the dark-haired hostess, \"We ran out of clean glasses and silverware.\" When wife (49 today) pointed to the full tray of silverware & complained about the wait, the hostess said, \"Well, what do you want me to do, girl? I am trying to help you.\" We returned to our spot on the bench directly outside the doors and waited another 20 minutes, watching other couples and small groups who arrived after us get seated. We went back in to ask about being seated and were told the hostess had called us twice with no response. This was obviously not True, as we were indeed right outside the door and heard every name called as we sat for that hour. Rudeness and untruths spoiled hopes for lovely birthday brunch.",

    "text": "I do love this place. I took my  teenage daughters for lunch. I haven't been here in a while, at least 1 year. I noticed one partner is gone, now there's only the name of the chef. I didn't see the grill outside were they used to cook the pork, instead i saw many very comfy tables and pretty umbrellas. It was Wednesday noon and it was very busy. My kids had the teenage face of boring/i don't care. The menu changed from the last time, at first i didn't know what to order until i saw food coming from the kitchen line. I had the Croc madame (or something like that) which i still remember with love! One of my kids had french toast and the other chicken sandwich.. My kids came to life with excitement!. The food was very San Francisco; pretty, tasty, big but not huge. I can easily consider this the best restaurant for breakfast or lunch in this side of the city.",

The place is pretty small, semi clean, and workers who didn't even want to look at you because they were so busy doing other things.   We decided to wait and in the mean time ordered a muffin. We stood there for a good 5 mins. for someone to even look at us and ask if we've been helped. I thought that was poor customer service for how many workers walked by and were fixing drinks right in front of us. At least take the time to look up and acknowledge us.    Other than that, the food we ordered was pretty good.  We tried to get the monkey bread and the empanadas but they didn't have either. We had the egg shooters (4/5), duck and cheese omelet (5/5), the burger (3/5), fruit crepe (4/5), and the salmon Benedict(3/5).    My husband liked it more than I did, I'm not sure if it was because of what I ordered. Maybe next time I'll have to choose something else.",

    "text": "I came here for brunch last week and I wanted to like this place. I really did.  And to some extent, I did--I got the salmon with caviar and it tasted great. I loved the cute little presentation and how it didn't overwhelmingly taste like caviar. I also tried the french toast and I loved the hints of orange. Not sure if the flavor came from the toast itself or the syrup, but it was unique for a basic french toast order. Wish we could have tried the monkey bread, since they were out at the time we ordered (it was around 11:30). If I have plans to come here again (or maybe order ahead of time), I still want to try it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the wait time and the lack of service during that extended period. Usually, I'm not very picky with waiting; I know things can get busy and hectic and I don't want to bother with complaining since the staff is already pressured to get all the orders in and served. However, I would have appreciated it if someone at least checked in during the almost half-hour we were waiting for the two dishes mentioned above. We didn't even get our glasses of water refilled (or offered to be refilled) during this time. Based on the food alone, I can say that it was *barely* worth the time we had to wait.  I'll consider coming back when it isn't busy, and hopefully I'll have a better time then.",

Once seated the waitress was very helpful and made some recommendations since I mentioned that I had never been there before.  I ordered the Egyptian and my cousin ordered the Mac Kitchen (I think that's what it was called). I don't know what I liked better!! Mine was fresh, healthy, and so tasty! Her was on the heavier side and packed with flavor! We decided to share both plates because we both wanted to try everything we could.  I also got the cappuccino with the marshmallows on top and it was MAGICAL! I want another one right now! it was a good large size and the the marshmallows added the perfect amount of sugar so I didn't even need to add sugar to my coffee like usual.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Come on, meet us in the lobby.  You drive.  Breakfast BBQ time!\"  continues the voice.  15 miles, 20 minutes later, greeted by the smell of fresh baked muffins, fried donuts, and roasting pork, Kitchen Table.  This is brunch done right.  Wasting no time, the smoked pork Benedict is excellent.  Creamy soft poached eggs that spill their yolky goodness over juicy, slow smoked pork belly.  The Jalapeno hollandaise providing a welcome heat, and acidity and finishing in a clean, fresh chili flavor.  Hawaii yeeps, think the best kalua pig bennies you've ever had.  Chiliqueles, a tasty hot mess.  Basically black beans, scrambled eggs, hand pulled smoky pork belly, a tangy Oaxaca cheese, drizzled in a creamy ancho sauce and topped with a sunny side up egg.  Get messy, mix it all up.  Flavors just work.  The basics are definitely done well.  Simple, made from scratch buttermilk pancakes with a good chew and mild sweetness.   Well made French toast.  Crisp and buttery on the outside, slightly creamy on the inside.  The muffins, controlled sweetness and tasting as they should (the banana walnut muffin FTW).  The only weakness, dishes using foie.  Totally unnecessary.  The Foie French toast is a pale imitation to that served at the venerable Sage Restaurant.  Foie and apple skillet cake with its wonderful caramelized apples and maple gastrique ruined by the fatty, oily, richness of the foie.  Very friendly off Strip service.  Fair, local pricing.  A great addition to the Hendertucky food scene.",

    "text": "Once upon a time I left a 5 star review. After my experience this morning I'm changing that rating and never coming back which is unfortunate. We sat outside where we ordered breakfast. Someone in my party who happens to be gluten intolerant ordered gluten free toast. The toast was brought out and she took a couple of bites and determined it probably wasn't gluten free. We call someone over to take it back. Here's where it goes bad. The manager came over to apologize which didn't end up being much of an apology but more of an opportunity to sound incredibly stupid and racist. She stood at our table and said \"honestly our kitchen is all Mexicans and they don't get it\"  Um excuse me? Hold up real quick as I pick up my jaw off the floor.   Fast forward 2 min, a blonde girl with a nose ring brings us the rest of our food and stands in front of our table looking at the food she's carrying as if she's never seen breakfast items in her life  \"Here we have the ummmmmmm.......toast?\", she says looking at the plate.  It was eggs in a basket off the menu and some other egg dish one of us ordered Like wtf. Honestly I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to run out with a team of cameras for the newest edition of punkd  I'm completely appalled that a manager would have this type of attitude towards her team. Along with being offended, as I'm a proud Mexican American, I'm embarrassed for kitchen table. I can't support a business that makes racist comments about their employees",

Then there was a delay in our meal because they lost our ticket. They decided to pick up our tab and the food was fine, but I had lost my appetite by that point. As someone who researches race and racism, I'm aware of the subtle and not so subtle ways it manifests itself (e.g. stereotypes about racial groups and their tipping practices). I recommend that the manager or owner consider sensitivity training. I'm happy to change my review when they do.",

I asked the waiter if he could recommend something that was comparable and he gave me a very nonchalant shrug. He basically said he has only tried a few dishes there so he couldn't do a comparison: I can't even remember what I got at this point , because I was sorely disappointed with the service and the letdown of not having their dish available.

Being a Sunday, my boyfriend reserved a spot ahead of time through Yelp. We got there right on time and the hostess (very friendly) told us it'd still be a 15-20 minute wait. We were fine with that. Then we noticed that the outdoor tables were mostly empty, so we said we'd sit out there. She said it was still a 5-minute wait. We weren't sure what the hold up was since there were so many empty tables, and we definitely waited longer than that.    I was shocked at the lack of selections, but then we realized that my boyfriend and I had two different versions of the menu, and mine seemed to be missing stuff. I ordered the All-American breakfast (eggs, sausage, toast, potatoes). It was ok. Not bad. Not extraordinary. What I didn't like was that the food was dripping in oil. I haven't felt very well since. My boyfriend ordered a prickly pear mimosa, French toast, and a smores crepe. He was happy! The ice water had no ice, and it took us quite awhile to get one straw. Just one.   Our waitress was very, very nice. I think that maybe they were overworked. The place was PACKED (so the food must be good!). Numerous times, food was brought out and served to the wrong table, or they didn't know at all who ordered it. Maybe they needed more waiters so that the service could be a little better.   I see all the great reviews, and this place was full of customers. So I think maybe this was just my experience. I don't plan on returning, but I think others would enjoy this (maybe not on a Sunday, though).",

Unfortunately, they hid them under the tortilla chips and I didn't see them until I was half way through.  Landon was incredible and offered to remake them and not charge me. I ended up just picking them off but the gesture is what matters. This is what customer service is all about! Thank you Landon for making our experience incredible!",

She is still there and now they have added another gal, a tad bit older and she looks to be the first girls boss OR at least giving her a lot of instructions which is probably OK however there were guest trying to check in, and we all were being ignored...no \"Hello, please allow us one moment\", No\" well be right with you\", and the topper was the S--T bomb was dropped..... quite inappropriate. (at least to me) Look this job isn't rocket science,  ( I should know as I trained the host staff for Ruth's Chris for 5 years~) you do need someone personable, out going and with an understanding that the most important person is the person standing in front of you. The 2 owners are so nice & personable, the food is DELISSSSH & very nice servers, this is the only crack in this restaurants facade.",

The atmosphere is very welcoming and yes it feels like you're eating at your mom's kitchen table. The staff was absolutely delightful and service was quick and efficient.   My wife - who is incredibly picky - loved everything. We started with the monkey bread which was good but not great. Obviously microwaved with some caramel drizzle but it was tasty.   Next came the corn empanadas which were delicious. The filling in one was a little cool, but the taste was incredible.   Main courses included the donut sandwich and the breakfast burrito. Both were amazing.   Small complaint - the menus. Worn out, tattered and stained paper photocopies on a clipboard?  You can do better.   I'm very happy I finally tried this place. Wasn't perfect but it was very, very good. I'll be back!",

My husband had the duck philly and although I hate duck, this was pretty good--he compared it to \"sisig\", it didn't have the duck taste. I thought the honeycomb latte was good although it did not have any honeycomb taste.   We came on a windy day so it was packed inside and we sat in a \"communal\" area, which I think is great for a bar but not for a breakfast lunch place. We sat next to a couple of women who were very talkative and I could not have my own conversation without yelling. I know there is some outdoor seating, which would be awesome for spring and fall.  I really enjoyed the food. Although, I would only say there if I had my own table.",

Servings were of a very generous size and we could not finish our plates.  I was very happy to hear that they will be opening a new location in south west at the Grammercy.

The potatoes were too salty but tasty.  The food here is 5 stars. I give the joint 4 stars because it's just so fucking loud. Hordes of taking people crammed into a small space and then on top off that din the restaurant is playing loud fucking pop songs on top of it. My ears are still ringing. I would suggest eating outside or going at an off peak time. I'll go again but not on a fucking Sunday.",

I do like the design and vibe of the restaurant and their coffee and pastries(monkey bread, biscuits, cookies) are GREAT! However, their food just isn't good. I've had their Chilaquiles, the smoked salmon benedict, the chicken fried steak, egg mac kitchen and pancakes & bacon. Everything was just off. The smoked salmon was too fishy, the chicken fried steak's chipotle sausage gravy, although adventurous, the flavors just didn't mend well with the rest of the meal. I've also been to Served which is in the same complex. Served is just good GOOD food even without comparing it to Kitchen Table. If you're deciding between Kitchen Table and Served- choose Served, you will not be disappointed. After 2 times, I will not be returning to Kitchen Table.",

The greens that came with it were so fresh and dressed perfectly. I also tried some of my dads pork belly bene and it was also very good. I just might need to order that next time! So flavorful. The chef came around to our table to make sure we were happy with our meals and was such a nice guy. He even complimented my young son's clothes. I highly recommend this restaurant!

Kitchen staff were arguing and all around bad morale. They took the dish off our bill but I'm Super disappointed as this is not the typical Vegas restaurant but it has gone downhill in a bad way.

It was extremely rich and filling. The kind of delicious, nap inducing breakfast I was looking for, quite opposite the light but flavorful salmon dish. I don't think I need to mention that the foies was delicious. Most impressively, we had a breakfast laced with foies gras and caviar for $60.

    "text": "I'm going to start out by saying that the decor and ambiance are wonderful. It's a beautiful, cozy and comfortable atmosphere, and the staff are all very friendly and attentive.  I came here for lunch, after a long morning of appointments, including a personal training session, so for me it was more like a late breakfast. I didn't want to derail my workout, so I was extremely happy when I saw steel cut oatmeal on the menu.  If you're a fan of steel-cut, you already know it's an entirely different taste and texture than regular old fashioned rolled oats, and hard to come by at restaurants.   When our meal arrived, I was incredibly disappointed to see that my $8 steel-cut oatmeal was nothing more than regular rolled oats. The flavor was good, but overall very dissatisfying. I didn't want to make a big deal of it, as my boyfriend had suggested sending it back for something else, but I really didn't want to have his food get cold while waiting for me to receive a substitution. Maybe the rolled oats were just a last minute replacement on their part, and it just happened that was the day I ordered oatmeal, or, they honestly are not aware of what steel-cut oatmeal actually is. How does a disorganized tourist trap at SLS know the difference, but this place doesn't??? It's a shame because based on the appearance and incredibly thoughtful and unique menu, you'd expect an establishment like this to get something as simple as oatmeal right.  I'm certainly in no rush to go back, but I suppose if I do, I'll stick to bacon and eggs or a simple pastry.",

I know here's more to add to the list but I've forgotten! Our kids love this place and Anthony couldn't be a better host or chef!  I would have more pictures but it's gone before I can get my phone :) I hope this place is around for the long haul, we've needed somewhere like this for a long long time",

Very good service even though they were quite busy during lunch; no wait due to one of the communal tables we sat at, which gave a nice sense of community because of briefly chatting with other diners.  All the other tables were individual ones like other restaurants. The chef is personable and has a good rapport with customers. If I could give more stars, I would. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "How have I not reviewed Kitchen Table yet? I am an unapologetic breakfast enthusiast. Not a snob. I like some perfectly-done eggs at a good diner as much as a fancy brunch. Kitchen Table is the place I would recommend first for people who visit from out of town.  First things first - there will be a wait. That tends to happen at places that are popular and make good food. Know this going in. They have indoor and outdoor seating, which helps with wait time, but you'll need to be patient unless you're an early riser. It's worth it.  The coffee is really good, and I feel like that's often an neglected part of reviews for breakfast places. Their baked goods are worth trying out, even if you just share biscuits and jam with someone, or try the Monkey Bread. They have mimosas with various juices and I think they do specials on buckets of beer. But the stars are the entrees. I've made it my mission to work through the menu, and I'm happy to report I've made good progress. My favorites so far: Duck and cheese omelette: If I need to explain why this is a good idea, we can't be friends. Country Benedict: many places do this dish, but KT's version is outstanding. And it has good kick, so be prepared. I believe it comes with some greens on the side, and I like the dressing they use. But the chicken fried steak and chipotle gravy combo on this keeps me coming back - at least on those mornings when I know I can take it slow the rest of the day.  Meatless Benedict: a bit lighter than the other options, but still packed with flavor. My wife gets the Croque Madam just about every time we go here. She is always tempted by something else, and ends up ordering this, because it is so good. Just look over the menu - you'll probably find at least three dishes that have you curious.",

Another great experience was that both the chefs/owners were at the restaurant greeting/seating people, chit chatted with guests, and came to different tables making sure everyone liked their food and satisfied.

The smoker was going outside, where we first attempted to sit before we were smoked out, but they did warn us prior to seating us and said they would be done in 20. So we moved inside.  We also ordered iced coffee (black, no sweetener or flavors), and it was a little bland/watered down, like it was hot coffee that they threw on ice. Not bad, but not the best. Don't let this hold you back!  Waiter and other staff were very friendly. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area.",

My coworker who lives in Henderson recommended this place so four of us met up there for lunch and needless to say, I was certainly not disappointed. It's really cute, with a cool vibe and there are really long tables so you get to socialize with other parties if you want, which I think is such a cute idea. Their coffee was delicious and so is their iced coffee as well. I got their breakfast taquitos which were soooo good. Very good portion, especially for the price. Super high quality for the price too. The breakfast taquitos tasted delicious but also looked beautiful: just excellent presentation. They were only $9!! My friends empanadas were yummy too, lots of delicious melty cheese. Then I tried my other friends' items: French toast and traditional eggs Benedict. Both were excellent. The French toast had such a good flavor and the homemade syrup on the table was perfect on the French toast. Extremely fair prices, excellent quality and service, cute atmosphere. I will definitely be back to Henderson, if only just to eat at this place!!!",

We came around 12ish had about a 25/30 minute wait. We had our hearts set on the monkey bread and when we went to order the waitress said they were sold out! She stated we needed to arrive early to get that. Umm if you're only open till 3:30 and it's a hot item you should know to have that in stock. So started out rocky. We sat outside and enjoyed the music one thing that was gross was they keep the trash cans on the outside porch there was flies non stop if you could put them out of sight and not around where people are eating that would be great. We ordered coffees after our meal. My husband went to order his after I did and was informed they ran out of milk so he couldn't have a speciality drink. I think this place will only learn from this and get better I hope! We will def give it another chance and hope they fixed these issues. Overall the food was Delish I would check it out!",

As Chef Antonio informed us over multiple visits to the table, everything here is made in house or made specially for this restaurant, from the bacons (yes, plural) to the baked goods.   CHOCOLATE CROISSANT: Unfortunately this was our only venture into the baked goods offered here, but it was a solid one. Not quite shaped as expected but filled with a rich, fragrant chocolate amid a lovely risen interior. EMPANADAS: My favorite dish of the morning! Simply served as a trio of tiny filled pastries over a bed of black beans and greens, these are filled with ample asadero and veggies, topped with a delicious crema and a spicy salsa.  TOSTADA: Happily served as a duo despite the singular name! The tortilla itself lacked the crisp I had expected, but was generously topped with shredded pork and slaw, as well as a fried quail egg. This needed a touch of something else, maybe the salsa from the previous dish? CRISPY FRENCH TOAST: I'm not a French Toast fan, but our server recommended it. The toast itself was crusted with granola, but wasn't particularly crispy. The creme anglaise and coffee flavors made this only lightly sweet, but it went unfinished at our table. CROQUE MADAME: I haven't met a Croque Madame I've liked until now. Usually the layers of ham and cheese and bechamel are just too rich and salty, but this version on challah highlighted the salty gruyere and showed restraint with the sauce. The egg was perfectly poached and the side salad lightened things up.  SHORTY BENEDICT: Worth the hype. Generous amounts of tender short rib (roasted on site!) and more perfectly poached eggs top the grilled bread with a bernaise-red wine reduction. This could have used just a hint of salt but it was pretty great as-is too. The side of house potatoes were nicely crunchy.  The menu alone makes this a spot I'll return to try more- there are still so many tasty things I want to try here! I especially enjoyed the personal touch of service that Chef Antonio provided, visiting each table and chatting with patrons. Our server was very sweet but could be a bit more attuned to timing. I enjoyed the crowded yet friendly atmosphere, very welcoming and homey, a successful execution of \"social eatery\".",

Considering that brunch is my favorite meal of the day, I was very sad when I moved to Vegas and had to abandon my regular brunch spots....until I came across this beauty!  Any spot that has mimosas has my heart, but when they offer as many flavors as Kitchen Table does, UGH! Real purees are used to mix the different flavors. I've tried that peach and the BlackBerry and both are equally as amazing. I do have to say at $8 for the amount that you get, is a little pricey.   The first time I can to dine, my friend had not finished her plate cause she was full. The manager (?) came to the table to let us know that he had to took the dish off the bill because he didn't believe it was up to standards. That kind of service and care what instantly had me hooked. She genuinely loved it and was full but he still took it off! If that doesn't show care, I don't know what does.   The food is fresh and absolutely delicious! Definitely going to be coming back at least once a week. Thank you for filling my brunch void!",

The omelet was an interesting idea but didn't work. It was filled with a cream like cheese and Mac n Cheese (yes, pasta), and had pieces of duck on top. The side of potatoes were cooked to perfection but seasoning was WAY off. WAY to much pepper. I was choking over the spice. I did really like how they were prepared besides the pepper though. Im happy I tried it, but it's not a place Id return to again and again.",

Eggs cooked perfectly, love the house potatoes and quite a selection of sausage. I got the Texas Jalapeno Hot Link. Great breakfast. My friend got the pork belly green chili breakfast. Can't remember the name but he loved it. My wife ordered the eggs in a basket and she loved it as well. We had amazing service and it was a great social environment. The manager had even introduced herself to us. She was very nice.  I'd recommend this place to anyone. Great food, great drinks and great service.",

    "text": "Another win for small business in Henderson. The Kitchen Table is located on the corner of Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde, right across from McDonald Ranch.  A small location perhaps, but packed full of delicious dishes. The menu is extensive and offers all traditional breakfast-brunch-lunch items, but many have a depth much more than just traditional. Pancakes, crepes, French toast, omelettes, egg dishes, chiliquiles, sandwiches, salads, a variety of baked goods, but each has choice ingredients and obvious thought has gone into each recipe.  The interior is lined with wooden tables, either wooden chairs or velvety booth seats. It's a natural feel and slightly sophisticated, yet homey and casual.  Antonio, one of the owners and chefs, introduced himself and sat us, was very friendly and made everyone in there I noticed feel attended to and important. He walked the restaurant a couple times to check on patrons. Our waitress was equally friendly and attentive.  The food was awesome!! I ordered the tacos heuvos (potatoes, eggs, chilies, avocado, ancho salsa) which was fantastic! Best breakfast tacos I've ever had. My hubby had the Blue Collar egg plate (eggs, potatoes, toast, homemade jelly) which he said was amazing. I ordered a foamy cappuccino, also quite good, as they source out their beans from a speciality coffee roaster. We also sampled a in house made glazed donut, light and airy, with yeasty overtones paired well with the sugary glaze, everything is top notch.  The bill for 2 plates, a large cappuccino and donut was $31.00.  We'll definitely be returning and I have a few plates in mind for my next visit!!",

After an hour was told it would be another 45-1 hour and there was a hold on the door. I asked for an explanation given there were 2 dozen people outside and a lot of empty tables. Said no explanation needed and the wait was the wait. I asked were they going to actively inform people a hold On door and was told no. I have been pleasantly surprised at how much customer service oozes out of every part of Vegas, not just strip. This was the worst i have experienced. Everything i have seen says the food is amazing, but first impressions last. I won't go back.",

    "text": "My friend is a local to Vegas, and had dined at Kitchen Table, previously. She mentioned it as a delicious breakfast option, for us to hit, before heading back to Orange County. I pulled the restaurant up on Yelp, and the decision to visit, was easily made, based on what I read and saw (via photos).  Kitchen Table, is tucked away, in the corner of a shopping center. They have indoor and outside seating. Restrooms are on site, of course. Upon entering, they'll likely be a short wait. The counter near the hostess stand, had assorted pastries, rolls, and other bakery-style goodies, to purchase. The decor was warm and inviting and the interior tables are wooden slats, with chairs and comfortable bench-style seats.  The menu is presented on a Staples clipboard. Kinda cheesy/funny, but ok. My boyfriend selected the Bacon and Egg Shooters, for us to indulge in, for an appetizer. It was good, but a tad too much mayonnaise, for me. It was also slippery underneath, so some of mine spilled, before I could transfer it to my small plate.  I chose the Pork Belly Bene, since eggs benedict is a go-to dish for me, and pork belly isn't an enemy either! It was presented well and tasted delicious. It had a slight, spicy kick to it, but was manageable. The english muffins were thin (thankfully) and seasoned wonderfully.  My boyfriend chose the Chorizo Omelette. It was so fulling and the chorizo they used, was kinda sweet, versus spicy. Again, we liked it (yes, I had a bite)!  My dear friend, ordered the Ham & Cheese Crepe. Great choice for those who want a lighter option (filling, carb wise). The sauce was terrific.  We'll return here easily, and also feel confident about recommending, to others.",

The jalapeno Bacon was delicious  The Bad- Coming from NY and being a cook myself, I think my expectation was set way to high. My husband had the oatmeal French toast...it was ok. I had the Pork Belly Benedict because it had been highly recommend, but needless to say I was highly disappointed!  Pork Belly is such a delicate cut of meat and should be handled as such....this restaurant completely butchered it, it was overcooked and doused in BBQ sauce, Pork Belly has such an amazing flavor, why would you French it in BBQ sauce?!...it should have been fried or seared or even candied but not bathed in generic flavored BBQ sauce, it honestly tasted like pulled pork, if I wanted pulled pork I would have gone elsewhere. The coffee was not great either smh  The Ugly- this is the kind if restaurant that has all the bells and whistles but not worth the effort. The problem begins with the menu, it is approximately 6 pages Long and stapled uneffortlessly at the top, It was soo extensive that I felt as though I were a teacher grading papers, I kid you not! When you have too many options on the menu ppl loose interest and become indecisive when it comes time to order. Also having too many options on a menu depreciates the quality of each dish, hense why my plate was less than average.  Overall I will not be returning",

The menu has something for everyone, If you want traditional, this is more on the inventive side but don't let that stop you, it all taste scrumptous! Seriously, I wanted to try all their baked goods, but my tummy was full from cleaning my plate. They have outside seating, but I'm a bay area girl and preferred to be seated in the cooler inside. It was summertime. Luckily, hubby and I missed the crowds, so we enjoyed both our meals 2 days in a row back to back. This will be my go to breakfast place in LV. Notable Dishes: Peaches and cream pancakes (sweet but so good) short rib benedict. Really, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. All depends on what your in the mood for!",

The outdoor patio was not being used, but the furniture is ripped and torn, and one fabric cabana was ripped to shreds. Continuing inside, the greeter looked like she would rather have been anywhere else than in this place and was definitely not welcoming. Once we were seated, I needed to use the restrooms - and it was filthy. You should never have to see someone else's diarrhoea splashed all over the toilet in a cafe - yuk. When I sat back down, and got a menu, it was food stained and had seen better days. All the other menus at our table were similarly filthy dirty. Looking around it was easy to see that the care of the place was at a bare minimum. I would have left, but was with a group, so we ordered and the food was tasty when it arrived, but all the other bad points about the place were distracting. This was such a great place to take friends and visitors from out of town when it opened, but I would not go there again quite honestly. As I said, the food was good, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but the rest of the place was shambles.",

We arrived before another couple and to our shock the owner told the hostess to seat them first since he knew them personally. That soured my experience from the beginning because it was very blatant. They were seated one table away from us and another older couple was seated next to us. They were regulars too and it was very obvious they knew the owner since he stayed by their table to rant about everything. He talked about a one star Yelp review that complained about the service and how it kept him up all night...how he talked to the waitress about it and on and on he went. So here he is airing his dirty laundry to regular customers about his/her bad customer service issues when he just seated his own friends before us and he clearly knew we came in before them. He also comped his friends tab which is his choice but seriously no one needs to hear about these issues, not even your regulars because other people can hear you too! The menus were hard to read with tiny fonts printed on brown paper that were clearly very worn. There were items on the menu no longer being served.  I had the pork rib Benedict and it tasted good but the potatoes were very soggy and bland. The short stack of pancakes were flat and not the least bit fluffy. What's the point of having really good maple syrup when your pancakes taste that bad!?! Other people have complained about the same thing. Why doesn't he fix these items ?!? I know why. He's too busy gallivanting around the restaurant.",

It's almost embarrassing when I sing its praises to friends (because I want them all to know about it so we can go there together!) and they say, \"Yes, I know. You've told me about it...MANY times!\" I've been here so many times, and each time, I'm greeted by a friendly hostess. Chef Antonio has been by my table to say hi and check on us more than half of the time we've visited. Okay, but I know you really want to hear about the food...  The hardest thing about going to an amazing place is trying something new because you fell in love with whatever you had last time; however, I have been making it a point to try out the new things. The Croque Madame is amazing, and you can't go wrong with any of the Benedicts. My favorites are the Meatless (those fried green tomatoes, tho!) and the pork belly. The pastries are delicious as well, so we usually order one as an appetizer. If you're lucky enough to get there early before they sell out, try the Monkey Bread. Yum!!! The cinnamon twist is great as well.   Now, if you're there for brunch, you must get a mimosa. I would suggest the pineapple, which they muddle themselves from fresh pineapple. It's so good! Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything here, but do get here early or prepare to wait. The place is small and a social eatery, so the wait can be upwards of an hour during busy times.",

My wife chose the peaches and cream pancakes that were fit for a king and large enough to feed his entire court.  Large bottles of two types of Noble syrup accompanied the order.  I chose the croque madame - challah bread, gruyere cheese, bechamel sauce, a thick slice of ham topped with a runny egg and a side salad of baby greens that featured highly addictive roasted, pickled tomatoes.  How good was my croque madame?  So good that I nearly croaked before I could lap up each and every morsel.",

We got a white chocolate pistachio muffin, which happened to be the best thing we ordered. Muffin was warm, moist, and not overly sweet. I ordered chicken fried steak with a bagel (instead of toast). Steak was so chewy that I couldn't finish a quarter of it. It took me a long time to cut and chew (lol). The breading was soggy and greasy. It fell apart from the steak. The country potatoes and sunny side up eggs were good. Bagel tasted more like old bread than a bagel. So I basically paid $15 for some potatoes and two eggs.  My husband ordered chile verde. Green sauce was good; pork belly was tasty, but the fat layer was so thick and not crispy that it felt like we were eating straight up pork fat.  We might come back just to pick up some muffins.",

It's my boyfriends birthday weekend so we started it off by coming here for breakfast right when they opened this morning.   The noise level in here is always high & the tables kind of feel crammed together - but i believe the chef wanted it that way so people interact and share their dining experience.   I almost always order the Turkey BLT because it's perfection with their jalapeno bacon and cranberryish sauce on it. ITS SO GOOD!!   But because it's Chris' birthday he wanted that so I wanted to order something different. So that's when this happened:   So I decided on the duck confit philly sandwhich - was supposed to have orange marmalade on it but didn't taste it so I ordered more on the side. The sandwich was so incredibly greasy it soaked all the chips that came with the sandwich so they were actually inedible. If they would have drained the duck before putting it on the bread it would have helped a LOT! The flavor was still good, but wouldn't order this sandwich again.",

We waited for 50 minutes, even though we did the check in online. We were seated outside but was never given a choice of inside or outside but I guess it was busy inside so we didn't have a choice.  After we were seated we waiting over 20 minutes for the waitress to take our drink order but we put the food order in too since we had a lot of time to look at the menu. It took a good 15-20 minutes before we got our drink order and not once did the anyone check in on us. When the food finally came out my order which is the simple breakfast of toast, eggs, potatoes and bacon, came out with 3 of the 4 items wrong.   My order was regular bacon, wheat toast and scrambled eggs. The order that came out was white toast, jalapenos bacon and sunny side up eggs. Our normal waitress didn't bring it out and I knew it was someone else's order but we kept waiting and waiting and no one came. Again, not once did anyone come by to check on us. My husband finally went into to tell the waitress the issue and she came out to give me a plate of scrambled eggs, by that time I realized the bacon was oddly spicy and I don't eat spice. We had to wave her down again and she tried bringing me a whole new plate with the right stuff but we were already too put off by the lack of service, follow through and correct food order. We had to get up to ask for ketchup and by Type of water refill. It wasn't that busy outside and everyone else's waitress and food seemed ok except for ours. My husband said his food was good but due to the terrible service, we will never be coming back here again.",

    "text": "Summary: they didn't honor our reservation; they did not tell our group they were out of several items; food was overcooked.  They do not honor the yelp reservation system. We made a reservation via yelp, and when we got to Kitchen Table (still before our check in time), we found out we had been removed from the list as they call by first come first serve (in person) at the restaurant.  Also, they seated us with an unrelated party at the same table with no space between. It really seems like we should have been asked if this was alright first (and we would have said yes, it's fine) but not being courteous to your guests is kind of a red flag.  The water cup I had was dirty, and had stuck on food debris. The table was not clean, and the paper napkin stuck to the surface of the table. They were out of several items, and did not let us know beforehand.  It was as if they were hoping we wouldn't order them and so when we did, it forced them to come clean. That's just not a good practice. They did not have cappucinos duck, or many of the mimosa flavors. Again, we were not told beforehand. They overcooked the eggs Benedict. They left out items on the plate that were mentioned on the menu.  The place is a bit overrated. Was not impressed by the food or service.",

The taquitos were super delicious but they were spicy so if you do not like spicy I would stay clear. The pancakes were amazing! The texture and flavor was great. They give you maple syrup and I need to find out where to order it because it made the already great pancakes even more amazing.   For drinks: they have a little coffee shop inside and we ordered some drinks while we waited waited for our table. I got a hot chocolate and it was topped with marshmallows. I also ordered a blueberry mimosa which was good but nothing about it made me go for seconds.   The only reason I am giving this place a 4 stars instead of 5 is because the glasses where they served us water smelled like eggs. I can't stand when dishware has that egg smell and it was so strong I just couldn't handle it. You could smell the strong egg smell the second they put the glasses down. It's a bummer but it won't stop me from going back.",

Given this is my third visit this month I'm getting to explore the extensive menu a bit more. Coffee cake was moist and delicious and not overly sweet. Biscuits are tender perhaps overly so and they tended to crumble when house made jam was spread on them. May need a bit better incorporation of the wet & dry ingredients in the batter - always a challenge to get the right consistency without over working and making a tough texture.  Eggs in a basket was delicious and filling. My wife could only eat about a third of her buttermilk pancakes ...very tasty but too large a portion. Lastly, I reconsidered my prior review on the house coffee as being excellent. I will drive from Anthem to eat the food but won't go outta my way to stop in for coffee. For a neighborhood gathering spot that primarily focuses on breakfast and brunch they need to offer great coffee to build a loyal following - it should be better. Don't know if it the beans or the brewing method - but Craft Kitchen a couple miles away has their coffee service nailed.  KT is well on its way to being a go to spot - but needs to focus its menu a bit so that execution is more consistent.",

Seated inside and after about 10+ minutes no one had come by to offer water or to take our order.  About 15 minutes in someone (not our server) came by to fill our water and we said we had a bit of a time limit so could we get a server?  She took our order.  While we were waiting for our food to arrive, our \"server\" came by to introduce himself and tell us he knew what we ordered and it would be out shortly.  It did come quickly, and it was delicious.  I was disappointed that our \"server\" never came back to see if our order was correct, or if we would like fresh drinks (we ordered mimosas while we were waiting, and had three empty glasses on the table).   About halfway through our meal the \"server\" brought the check, put it on the table and said \"no rush.\"  Still didn't ask if our food was okay or if we would like another drink.  Our party of three all looked at each other and said \"eh, not sure if I'd give this place another chance.\"  Too bad because the food was great!",

Once I bit into each, they weren't soft and weren't tasteful. Not to mention they were out of monkey bread and have only been open 2 hours.. Their response was \"early bird gets the first worm.\" However, this is really just a lack of leadership and preparation. They need to prepare ahead of time for the amount of food people will buy. That's how corporate chains thrive. Made me feel like this is such a \"baby\" company. From a business standpoint you have to know what's popular and over prepare, because at the end of the day, it's about making a great experience for the customer. On top of that, the server wasn't very kind, criticizing our order and kind of making fun of it when asking questions about healthy omelette options. Also, all of their boosters and high chairs don't have buckles for safety. Huge parent's points fail. Overall, I will not recommend this place to anyone that I talk to because the food is mediocre and so is the business side of the restaurant. They have a lot of room for growth before I come back and spend $13-$15 on a meal. If you expect me to pay for high standards, you better match what I'm paying for.",

We ordered baked goods as as well as menu items and as I stated earlier the food was amazing. The only problem I had is with the cleanliness of the place. There was a lot of crumbs and chunks of food under our table as well as a piece of broken glass. It appeared that the purchase of a broom might solve the problem. I'm not usually one to complain about a few crumbs here and there, but this was bad. My son had to use the bathroom and that's when the cleanliness issue really became a problem for me. The toilet seat was so loose I could pull it off and either they just got bombed by a customer of the toilet had not been cleaned for a while. I had to hold my son in the air to go because there is no way his little butt was getting anywhere near that toilet. There was trash all over the floor as well. It just seemed that they had never cleaned up after service. Hopefully this issue gets addressed because the food is great, but if the front of house is dirty what does the kitchen look like.",

When we were greeted we were told 5-10 minute wait( there were at least 6 tables inside that were available). After waiting 10 the hostess informed us it would be another 5-10 minutes because they had to set up the patio tables and the server had not arrived yet for that section. We were finally seated at the patio and placed our order at 830. Our server never apologized for the wait or delay. In fact his only words were to say \"I'm so tired, I got off from my second job at 3am\" . Our food arrived shortly after 9. My wife ordered the traditional Benedict and I had the Chorizo Omelette. The Benedict clearly sat in the kitchen window as by the time it arrived to our table, the medium eggs cooked through and the potatoes were ice cold. The flavor in my omelette was great, but also cold. When we asked for salt and extra lemons, our server casually went to the service station on the patio and stood and talked with the other servers until my wife had to go up to them and remind him about the salt. Finally when he returned to the table, he made no apologize for the delay and another snide comment of \"did we chop down enough lemon trees for ya?!\" All in all, the taste of the food saved this from a zero star review. It doesn't matter how good the food is if the hostess is unprepared and the service staff simply doesn't give a damn. I don't think we will return. There is comparable food and much better service at other local breakfast joints.",

When we walked up, we saw several parties of people waiting out front, I thought oh crap! Went inside and the hostess said only a 15 min wait, they were getting more tables ready. I noticed there were a dozen open tables inside and on the patio, so I took her word for it. Well, after 40 mins of waiting, and still several empty tables, we had enough. There were 3 other parties that left as well. What made me really angry, and actually a few other that were waiting as well, was when two hipster dudes walked in, and the chef greeted them and immediately sat them! Honestly I would rather go to Eat in downtown Vegas, they know how to make great breakfast/brunch and know how important it is for a resto to turn over tables.",

    "text": "Kitchen Table is very consistent. By that, I mean that the food is consistently good, but the service is consistently bad.  Let me explain.  With today's visit, it took about ten minutes for us to be seated despite a dozen employees frantically pacing the restaurant. Upon being seated, it took another ten or so minutes for a waitress to appear. From there, I was hoping the service would improve, but per usual, it didn't. It was slow and our waitress seemed indifferent about us, her job, and maybe life in general. In entirety, our \"quick brunch\" took about half an hour.  As for the food, it's very good. I appreciate their vast array of unusually flavored mimosas. Today I ordered the guava one and it was perfect. I can't even think of another word for it...just perfect. Every time I've been here, I've ordered the monkey bread. It's a fair portion for a fair price, and topped with a caramel-y glaze. I wish I could offer a picture of it, but it was devoured within minutes. I ordered the meatless Benedict as my meal and (as always) it was great. This is the only restaurant I've seen fried green tomatoes on a Benedict and it offers such a unique twist to the traditional textures and flavors of an eggs Benedict.  Long story short, Kitchen Table has a five star selection of fantastic food, but the service always disappoints. Hopefully they'll eventually work these kinks out and I can give them the five stars that the monkey bread deserves.",

    "text": "First visit here for lunch, accompanied by friends.  Upon stepping inside, we noticed that it was extremely noisy and loud, to the extent it was difficult to carry on with a comfortable conversation.  It may have been partly attributed to the fact that we came near the peak of lunch, or perhaps it was due to the presence of a very large group, that was also very loud.  Thankfully, as the restaurant emptied out, along with the large group next to us, the decibels dropped drastically, and it was much more pleasant.  Nonetheless, it was somewhat of an irritant during much of our meal.     As for the food, it was fine, nothing particularly special.  I enjoyed my kale salad with a pear vinaigrette dressing.  There was am ample amount of cheese dispersed throughout the salad, and although I liked the addition of dates, there were almost too many, making the salad sweeter than I would've preferred.  I think they used medjool dates though, which are my favorites, followed by barhi dates.  I'm thinking because of the close proximity of Las Vegas to Palm Desert, they must have easy acess to phenomenal dates from the Desert.  I was able to sample the pastrami sandwich, which for me seemed overly salted.  Personally, for me, having pastrami outside of New York City is literally criminal, so I selectively choose not to commit that crime.  However, who am I to critique anyone else's selection?  So...I didn't.    The smoked salmon and benedict looked presentable, and appeared well liked.  However, I didn't get to try either.  Remember friends, sharing is caring!   The atmosphere was cute, but again, the noise level was bothersome.    Parking was easy and plentiful, as almost everywhere off the Strip is.    Apparently, this location will be briefly closing, but unbeknownst to us, there's also a Summerlin location.    For me, this falls into the category of mediocre all the way around.   Meaning, fine if you're in the vicinity and can't find anything else better, but certainly not worth an out of the way trek to.",

The entire time I was there the place was hopping non stop and the waitresses in there were running laps non stop and they did a fantastic job keeping everything rolling.  Now the FOOOODDDD!!! So when you first walk in you will see a counter of homemade bake goods that look and taste so amazing and prep your taste buds for what's to come. I tried the monkey bread and a lemon blueberry muffin, the muffin was amazing and the monkey bread was decent, I will say in order to try there sweet treats you need to arrive early because it all sells out fast and when it's gone it's gone. So for the main dish I had the chicken fried steak Benedict and man was it ow weeee good, the portion size was huge and it had a plethora of flavor and spice and everything nice.  I literally ate everything on the plate and scrapped the sauce off, we also ordered the jalapeno bacon which had a slight  I spice to go with the bacon flavor and is a must try.  Even as I was eating and enjoying my plate I had food envy for all the food that was being ordered around me, I couldn't help but to stare and I imagine if I wasn't so big people would have been mad and telling me not to stare lol. The presentation on the food was so good that I wanted to try everything so I'm definitely going back multiple times...... oh and don't forget to try there homemade syrup which is to die 4 and the prices are beyond fair  Happy eating :)",

    "text": "I had came here for Brunch recently on Sunday with my friend. I had wanted to take her to some new places around town which she would normally not go to. Originally, our plan was to go to Served, which happened to be in the same complex but their wait time far exceeded my expectations, so we moved places and came here instead.   This was another place I had wanted to come to for brunch, but never  had the opportunity. She had used the online waitlist function on the Yelp app to help us get a spot in line before we even left Served which helped on the wait time to get a table.   Cute little place sitting on the corner of the complex on Horizon. Mildly hidden away from the parking lot but they have a big sign facing towards the parking lot for easier visualization. Restaurant itself has a small open style kitchen with seating inside and outside in the patio. Plenty of people seating inside and outside.   Upon arrival, we had \"checked in\" and was seated within 5-10 minutes. Waiter had came up quickly and took our order.   Mimosa's sounded like a good idea and we each got one. She had picked a mango mimosa and I had gotten the prickly pear mimosa, by recommendation from the server. Beautiful yellow color for the mango and deep pink color for the prickly pear. I can see the preparation in the kitchen from our table, and saw they used like a fresh fruit concoction to make the mimosas versus like the usual juice + champagne.   We had gotten a monkey bread to share as many other reviewers had seemed to rave about this appetizer. Served in a small cast iron pan, 7 pieces of hot baked \"monkey bread\" consisting of a sweet dough w/ salted caramel drizzled on top and cinnamon sugar. Very crispy exterior and a super soft chewy interior, very reminiscent of a cinnamon roll in flavor ! Good thing to share between more than just 2 people. She had 1 piece only, where I had 2 but that still left 4 to take home. Lol   She had ordered a 'country benedict' which consists of 2 portion of country fried steak, poached eggs, chipotle gravy on top of biscuits with house potatoes. This was the only one on biscuits, whereas every other benedict is on English muffins. Typically, i like getting biscuits over English muffins but in this case, i think English muffins would have worked better. Their muffins were softer and moister than normal which didn't hold well to the gravy nor the creamy, runny yolk from the egg.   I had gotten the 'Duck and Cheese Omelette' because they were out of the 'Shorty Benedict' (sad!). The omelette consists of duck confit, elbow pasta?!?, bechamel sauce, Gruyere cheese, house potatoes, and toasted bread. Not sure why the elbow pasta is needed. Bechamel sauce w/ gruyere cheese made it light but heavy as the same time. The duck confit was a bit different from what i had imagined. It had more of like a soup meat/braised stringy texture but it was quite tender. Not that flavorful in terms of a duck flavor aspect though. I had requested sour dough bread but had gotten white instead. I didn't care too much as this omelette had stuffed me really well.... So well that i had not ate anything for the rest of the night, up until almost 23 hours later ! What did they put in this omelette?!? LOL Oh the food also knocked me out for 3 hours after getting home !   My friend had ordered a 'Strawberry Shortcake French Toast' too which consisted of challah, orange zest batter, strawberry gastrique, and whip cream. She had taken a bite but i was way too stuffed to even try it.   Overall, the meal was decent but the wait for the food was very long. We couldn't understand why. It was later on in the day and the tables were kind of clearing out. Besides the monkey bread and mimosa's that came out fairly quickly, the main dishes took almost 30 minutes to come to our table. The new customers who came much later, had ordered and gotten their food during our meal !",

This for Breakfast would have been perfect but of course I continued to keep reading the menu. For starts it's a great menu but not very informative about GF options par the GF Sweet bread. The server wasn't that helpful either. My guest finally arrived and we order the smoked salmon caviar but asked for It on GF bread. A little disappointed as it wasn't quail egg like stated on the menu, it was a fried chicken egg :( when I asked the server if it was meant to be quail she said yes but they ran out so they just switch it to a normal egg... not so cool should have asked if we still wanted to do that!  The other dish was Egyptian. It was poached egg bacon and salad and GF toast and the topping was walnuts with something Lemony not sure if it was the walnuts or the salad dressing. Not bad but won't try it again.  The space between some of the tables is a little awkward to get through if you don't want to end up sitting in others food (I have size 7 feet took my shoe off just to see the gap size and it was half of my shoe lol)  Everything seems clean and very relaxed. Wouldn't suggest it for families with small children. As the space and noise may be to much. Because of the close proximity of the other tables not a great place for business. Good space for Friends to meet and have breakfast/brunch. Not great for GF options but definitely have some interesting menu i teams and for sure great for that Creme brulee cappuccino",

    "text": "Worth the wait! Kitchen Table was delicious. We were seated promptly after previously signing up for the waitlist on Yelp. We started with two Micheladas and the Crab Avocado Dip. The dip was cheesy and flavorful. It wasn't too rich so the avocado wasn't necessary. Be prepared to request additional chips as there weren't enough. For our second course, we had the Croque Madame. This was a wonderful dish. The slight sweetness of the Challah paired with the rich flavor of the Gruyere, the juicy ham and topped with the creaminess of the bechamel was PERFECT! Even though we were completely stuffed, we managed to overfill our bellies with their White Chocolate French Toast. For this, I am grateful. I would've hated to miss out on that! All in all, Kitchen Table provided a robust experience. One that I plan to enjoy again on our next visit.",

BAD: It was $73 before tip for three entrees, coffee, and appetizers. Way more than the two $$ would imply.  I haven't the foggiest idea why this place has so many high ratings. Skip it, go Eggworks or Egg and I instead.",

The server was really sweet but never came to check to see if we needed more water, another juice, more coffee, or if the food was okay in general.   I don't remember what I had the first time I came here, and the second time I had the chilaquiles. I don't understand how the owners are Hispanic and feel that the dish is okay to serve tasting how it does. The tortilla chips I'm pretty sure are store bought, and the amount of pork they put is so minuscule it left me wanting more.   All in all, I'm not driving out of the way to come back again. I'd rather swing by Served or Craft Kitchen for breakfast in the area.",

I must admit, looking at the menu was overwhelming with the diversity of brunch entrees, but I could tell a lot of creativity was put into it.One thing is for sure, it leaves me with something to look forward to next time, that's always a plus!     They also have separate to-go entrees which is good when I'm on the run.   I walked in right after noon time, it was packed luckily its just me so I didn't have to wait.   I ordered these items:  Empanadas consists of squash, corn, roasted chilies, asadero cheese and salsa verde.  I don't even care that these were vegetarian, these were so good, the filling was cooked just right.   Pork Belly Bene  Smoked Pork Belly, Jalapeno Hollandaise, English muffin, and potatoes. All I can say is Wow!  The pork belly is super rich, fork-tender and flavorful, and has the most wonderful caramelized crispy bits. Add the egg and Jalapeno Hollandaise sauce puts it way over the top. Must Try!  Overall, my experience was fine and I felt the prices were justified for what I ate.",

They did the right thing By taking an entree off the bill, but sadly it put a tarnish on our Fathers Day lunch there.",

    "text": "Beautiful spot with a great outdoor dining option. When you walk in, you're immediately greeted with a large counter covered with pastries. Then, you get a look into the open kitchen with Chefs Antonio and Javier working right in front of you.  I've had several of their pastries and my favorite was definitely the Monkey Bread ($5). Sticky, gooey cinnamon balls compressed together in the form of a muffin. They're tender and perfectly sweet.  Mexican Hot Chocolate w/ Charred Marshmallows ($4): Uhh, YUM! Really good, slighly thick hot chocolate with a little kick of spice and roasted marshmallows. Also, very pretty.  Tostada ($8): Suckling pig, black beans, cilantro slaw, salsa, and quail egg. Delicious combination of toppings with a crispy tostada and flavorful salsa. It was also refreshing with the slaw.  Steel Cut Oatmeal ($8): Brown sugar, dates, and toasted walnuts. My friend absolutely loved the oatmeal citing it the best oatmeal she's ever had! And she was right - it's so yummy!  Duck and Cheese Omelette ($13): Housemade mac and cheese and duck confit. The creaminess from the mac and cheese is amazing with the fluffy eggs and duck. This is far from being a simple omelette, yet not overly complicated.  Pork Belly Benedict ($15): Chipotle BBQ, poached eggs, and jalapeno hollandaise on English muffin. The pork belly is great, though I could've done without the BBQ. Solid benedict overall.  Warning: It is quite spicy! The accompanying potatoes were delish.  Chorizo Crepe ($12): Roasted poblano, chorizo, green chile, Oaxacan cheese, and crema. WOW! I adore savory crepes and this one really blew me away. There was so much depth of flavor and everything just really came together. Really amazing.  Foie French Toast ($21): Amaretto batter, seared foie, caramelized pears, and candied nuts. There's really nothing to dislike about this dish. A delicious french toast (Hello, amaretto!) with a creamy seared foie. I LOVE FOIE.  Smoked Salmon and Caviar ($14): Caviar, smoked salmon, sunny side-up quail eggs, blini, crema, dill oil, and micro greens. More of my favorite foods (smoked salmon and caviar) and I loved the combination of everything on the blinis. Great little bites.  Bottom line: The food is delicious. The menu is vast. There are touches of creativity everywhere. They're killing the breakfast and lunch scene!",

This time they appeared and tasted like they were from a store bought frozen package.   The oatmeal was nothing to write home about. Despite the menu reading that it had raisins & dates, mine was served with 1 raisin and 2 very small pieces of date.   I don't know if today was an off day but we will definitely be back in hopes of finding a great breakfast again.",

It gave us a chance to decide what we were having anyway. Unfortunately, we came in too late in the brunch service, so all the pastries were sold out, including the D'Nuts and Biscuits. Ah well, maybe next time.   I had the Bagels and Lox, Jalapeno Bacon, a guava mimosa for Mr. Lefty, and a peach mimosa for Mr. Righty.  Bagels and Lox were good. $15, but it comes with a lot of smoked salmon, and a mixed greens salad. I wasn't too impressed with the bagel, though. It was a bit soggy, so I ditched it halfway through and just made a salad out of some extra greens and the lox.  Jalapeno Bacon was great!  They had a nice little kick to em.   Mimosas hit the spot too, a little on the strong side, which was A OK with me hehe.   I had a bite of my friend's pork belly benedict, and holy! That pork was sooooo good! The fat just melted in my mouth, and it was a perfect blend of spicy and sweet. I'm definitely ordering it myself next time (when I come earlier in the day for the pastries).",

Just looking at the food alone is so appetizing, and it's always worth the wait and literally anything on the menu is amazing.  I kid you not, I'm here ALL the time for a reason.  The pancakes are the fluffiness pancakes you'll ever have, I'm not a pancake person, and these are by far the best pancakes ever! Definitely worth ordering. Like I said anything you order at this lovely bistro is worth ordering, and I come here time and time again just to order more and different things.",

She even brought us some muffins because our order was taking a while. I had the pork belly benedict, which is my new favorite breakfast item! This is my new spot, and cannot wait to take some more friends and family members here... seems to be one of green valleys best kept secrets.",

    "text": "Had heard a lot of buzz about the Kitchen Table and was eager to get myself down there to see for myself. Being a Thursday at 9am my girlfriend and I were sat immediately and the place was not too crowded.   First and foremost the decor was rustic which I liked and the plates and mugs were all very in tune with the atmosphere. You certainly get a comfy neighborhood vibe within the kitchen table which I also enjoyed.  Our waitress Nicole greeted us promptly and was attentive throughout the service as well. Water glasses were never empty and she was present throughout the meal without being intrusive.   As for the food I got the the Shorty Benedict which is an eggs benedict made with braised short rib with bearnaise and red wine reduction. It was astounding. The meal was hearty and left me very content for the remainder of the day. All the flavors complimented each other extremely well and was only made better by the side of potatoes that accompanies it.  My only gripe as a self proclaimed coffee snob was that the price point for the iced coffee is a bit high for what you get. But that alone was not enough for me to even consider wavering from a 5 star review of the Kitchen Table. Absolutely must try new venue in the Henderson area.",

It was very light and the fruit compote was just right. My friend ended up ordering the strawberry French toast and O M G was it delicious!! The strawberry syrup that they drizzle on top was so fresh. You can instantly tell it was fresh fruit and just made. Definitely recommend this place for brunch!

Egg was perfectly cooked, hollandaise was on point and the beef was super tender. Everyone in our party loved the food. They also have a great choice of Mamosa's. The only issue we had was the air-conditioner wasn't really working that day, so as you can imagine it was hottt in the restaurant. We will definitely go again, this maybe my new brunch spot in Henderson.",

I tried to flag down the waitress because 2 tables over had cloth napkins, the chef interviend and got the napkins saying his order of napkins had not arrived. WHY NOT GO TO A GROCERY STORE AND BUY 5 PACKS OF NAPKINS.  The waitress served ice tea AND water and 1 straw. The English muffin was stone cold and when I asked for butter I was told that their clientele didn't use butter. My eggs in a basket had salad on top with bacon strips over that and hot peppered potatoes on both sides, very nuovo but all was cold.  The menu words were so small it was hard to read. The bathroom fixture was falling off the wall.  In conclusion, the attention to detail is lost here.  You are paying for better attention to details.",

The pastries are fresh and they bake only so many a day; which is a good thing (they don't recycle) and a bad thing (I missed out on that yummy monkey bread twice).    I highly recommend the quail egg and caviar bilinis!  They were absolutely fantastic, but were not filling... Make sure you order a sausage or something.    The chicken-fried steak with the potatoes and egg cooked any way?  Flavorful, but the steak was a little tough and gristly.   Coffee = 5 stars. I love the coffee cups and the dinnerware!   Service is nice.  Kitchen was a little slow both times, but it's nice you can see the cooks and the chef busting their asses.  Seating could be a little more organized...   It's a little crammed; I can listen to my neighbors' conversation rather than my fiance's.  But overall, delicious.",

    "text": "I willl start by saying my review is based solely on the customer service. I have eaten here twice and was happy with my meals, the first time I had a salad which was ok and the second time I had the pork belly eggs Benedict. The pork belly was a little overwhelming but I suppose that is what it's supposed to do. Overall a good plate, perhaps just not for me as it was my first meal of the day and was too heavy. My one star review was given because this past Monday around 11 am I called to place a phone order and was told that they don't take orders over the phone and that I must walk into the restaurant to place my to go order. I thought that was a bit strange but I live 1 block away and decided to go in anyways. As I arrived I was not greeted by anyone but was directed to the bakery section by the host to place my to go order. Once again I had to greet the bakery host as she stared at me with a blank face. I told her that I wanted to place a to go order and that I needed to see the menu. She informed me that they do not offer take out. At this point I'm extremely frustrated and annoyed that once again my requests cannot be made. I explained to her that the hostess who answered my call said they will only take \"to go orders\" if present in the restaurant. She did not offer any type of apology she just explained why they do not offer it. Apparently they have received complaints about their food being soggy with take out orders. I  completely understand that as all of their plates are very very saucy, almost overwhelmingly saucy which is why I've always requested all sauces to be placed on the side. I was hoping that she would accommodate me as I was misinformed by their staff and was only requesting scrambled eggs and plain pancakes- absolutely no way for there to be sogginess. Once again no apology she just replied, \"I can't do that.\" I am not an unreasonable person, I am well aware that people make mistakes. Trust me when I say an apology and a thank you would have gone a long way. She made me feel bad and let me leave upset and disappointed. She clearly has no respect for where she works and made the establishment look very bad. Living a block away this should be my go to breakfast/lunch restaurant as they have a nice patio area but after this mistreatment I will not be back. Such a shame, all of this could have been avoided with better customer service and perhaps a crack of a smile.   To the owner- we can see and appreciate that you have spent a lot of time on the menu and decor, there is no reason why you should lose what would be a loyal customer because your staff offers no customer service skills what so ever. Time to clean up shop.",

Tried the traditional eggs benedict, Pork Belly Green Chille which comes on nachos, and the Chorizo Omelette. All were good. The traditional eggs benedict was... traditional.   Drinks also good!

We wanted monkey bread to start but we were too late and they were sold out so we ordered the muffin of the day which was a triple berry muffin. It was very good and moist.

The restaurant itself is a little hidden from the parking lot, but there is a clear sign indicating that they are open for business.  As you approach, you can see a large seating area on the outside...looks like a pet friendly patio, but it was too cold on this autumn morning to even have this area open. Inside, you can sit at a communal table or 2 top tables...I am a 5'4\" on a good day and the table was way too high for me. As such, I literally had to sit on a booster seat.  The table was nicely made with woodblock, creating a whimsical and natural feeling, though it also ends up with an uneven surface, causing me to keep moving my glass in order to make sure it won't fall. Some ceiling panels were missing, revealing portions of the ceiling open to our sight...I found it very uncared for. I am sure it is a temporary situation, but too bad it was there for me to see.  We had The Shorty, a short rib benedict. This dish was a good portion and rich in flavor. We also had the Chorizo Crepe, an item well-balanced in flavor with a refreshing sauce. Finally, I partook in a Red Sangria, which had an ample amount of fresh fruits.  I chose the Shorty Benedict because of the mouthwatering pictures on Yelp...very yummy, but as is often the case with short ribs, there was a big chuck of fat I could do without.  Service was very good and it seemed like everyone around us already had dined at Kitchen Table many times before...friendly hugs and well wishes were in the air...I can tell this place is loved and appreciated by the community.",

We came for breakfast and got a coffee, pork belly with green chilies and eggs, and an egg white veggie frittata.  The menu is very eclectic and modernizes classical dishes in new ways. Lots of things looked good and seeing other dishes come out made us second guess our choices. But we chose well! The pork belly and eggs were delicious. It had a very authentic taste and a depth of flavor. Quite spicy but we liked the heat. The tortilla chips were fried well - they were thick, not those flimsy overly oily things you sometimes get - and were great for scooping up the rest of the dish. What set the egg white frittata apart from others was the cauliflower puree. This was so cauliflower-y in the best way possible. It added an earthiness and a creaminess to the eggs. The frittata was under seasoned but It was ok because I got to try their homemade salsa. Delish, but really hot as well! Glad we stopped in here :)",

    "text": "A friend of mine kept raving about this place, so I decided it was time for me to check it out. I brought my food road dog with me, my mom. We enjoy checking out new places in the valley. especially if they're in Henderson! Score! Seems like all the good places are outside this growing town, but bit by bit we're getting more specialty eateries, like Kitchen Table.  When you walk in, the inside is very small, but cute and country like. There is not really a lot of seating inside, but they do have some outside. The tables are big enough to hold your drink and food, not like you need to shuffle things around to make room.  Now, onto the food.  I order the vegetarian hash, roasted seasonal squash, peppers, potatoes,garlic confit, fresh herbs and 2 eggs, but I don't get eggs. Still tastes so fresh and delicious. For some reason I love eating the garlic cloves and find myself saving some for last. Toast is also served with it, which adds to the deliciousness. One morning, I felt a little adventurous and ordered the Mexican hot chocolate.  The lady said it has a \"little kick.\" I'm not sure what was \"little\" about that kick because my mouth was on fire.  I usually have a high tolerance for spice, but this completely caught me off guard.  Definitely a wake-me-up! It comes with marshmallows, but I didn't get them.  Although it kicked my butt, it was still good.   Staff here are always friendly and check up on you to see how you're doing.  My mom and I really enjoy coming here to eat.  I may eat the same thing every time, but the vegetarian hash is just too good to switch from haha! The prices here are not too bad either. Between my mom's coffee, her meal and mine, its a little over $20.  Not too bad!",

On average it seems that they have at least about a 30 minute wait on the weekends but you are able to be waitlisted if you are within 10 miles of the restaurant through yelp which is pretty awesome. They do have a decent sized menu and they offer beer and mimosas. My friend tried the blackberry mimosa which tasted ok and then I had the snickerdoodle latte which was actually really good. I had the fruit crepe which was ok and a side of potatoes which were pretty good. My friend had the Egyptian which he said was ok. I feel like the price is a little steep but I would definitely check it out at least once because the vibe is pretty cool.",

Same as the first time the hostess does not seem into her position.  We waited at the front and were looked by at by three people and addressed by a chef who came from the back??  The hostess finally jumped in and sat us and then gave us an eye roll when we made small talk. Crazy. The place was not even busy.  How come I feel like I am imposing when I come here and give money for bad treatment.   My wife spoke to the manager who apologized.    Our server was good and the food was too but tough to overcome the initial treatment.    There are too many places that will appreciate its customers.  This place is just not for us.

    "text": "\"It's not about time, it's about choices. How are you spending your choices?\" - Beverly Adamo  Pork Belly! Foie Gras! Short Rib! Chicken Fried Steak! If this list catches your attention then Kitchen Table is the place for you...besides, why have bacon when you could add foie to your pork belly? Kitchen Table offers an impressive variety of breakfast and lunch options. I don't know many places where you can choose from a Monte Cristo, Croque Madame, Chiliquiles, Duck and Cheese Omlette, Chorizo Crepe, Pork Green Chilie, and Lox & Bagels, but you can at KT...Comfort food on steroids to say the least.  I was glad to have the opportunity to check out Kitchen Table. We split the Beef Short Rib Benedict and the Chorizo Crepe. In general, the dishes were heavier and richer then what I'm typically looking for. Still, what they do, they do well. I think I would have enjoyed a smaller sampling of several items quite a bit. There are a few healthier items on the list, but I feel like these are more appropriate as attempts to appease guests of those coming to eat the dishes that Kitchen Table has become known for. KT also has a nice selection of baked goods, though there were only two of us and we were not hungry enough to share more. It did make me think that this would be a nice place for a larger group to come and share some items.   It was too cold for what I would guess would be a happening patio during warm days, so we sat inside on a 2-top...one chair and one sofa/banquette. The banquette has a serious issue however. It is 3 inches too short for the tables and chairs, so unless you are over 6' 6'' then you are eating somewhere around chest level...making for an uncomfortable situation.   In the end, although it's not a spot I'm going to rush back to, I can appreciate what they are doing at Kitchen Table. 3.5 Stars seems right for me, but I'm rounding to 4 Stars since my love awarded 3 Stars and I can justify balancing things out in my mind.",

The hostess sat us outside as requested but she had few words to say...we had no idea if she would be back, someone would come over to us, etc.  While someone filled our waters shortly after arrival, we were not able to order our coffees for about fifteen minutes yet meet our actually server.   It was hard to flag our server let alone any other one, and communication between them seemed disjointed.  However, when we had any server's attention they were nice and apologetic, but still things were forgotten. Seems as if different people have different tables and only look out for those and if your server doesn't come around then well you are for the most part...* out of luck.    The food was excellent and prepared as ordered.  So no complaints there...Love this place I hope they can get service to match the food. None the less we enjoyed the outdoor space.",

I've seriously heard such amazing things about this place that we decided to try it out this past weekend.   The location of this spot is probably the most hole-in-the-wall location you can get in Henderson. It's across the street from MacDonald Ranch and is in a location where mainly doctor offices and nail tec spots are. I could be wrong, but I don't think there are any other restaurants in this spot.   When you walk up, there's a super cute patio area that I'm sure will be so great for the fall/spring time or if we had got there a little earlier. We got there around 1:30pm, which from overheard convos is definitely the time to get there as it sounds like you could be waiting a bit if you got there early so kudos to us I guess for not really being early risers haha.   The inside of this restaurant is adorable. A hutch hides the cute glassware directly behind the hostess stand. You can see directly into the kitchen right when you walk in, which I always love! We were immediately sat at a long table that had other groups sat at it as well. I love when places have seating like this. It just feels like you're right at home. The wall had an adorable chalk sign on it stating they were established in 2015. And I felt worse than it's taken me 4 years to finally get there. Where has the time gone?!  Now on to the drinks and food. The menu here is perfect. Not too long. Not too short. There are plenty of options, but not too many that you feel overwhelmed. I had looked up pics of the menu on Yelp before we went and decided I wanted the Nutella crepe but when I got the menu from our server, it was missing from the menu. In a way, I was super glad because it allowed me to step a little outside my comfort zone and try something different!   They have a really great beer and cocktail menu. I ordered the white sangria spritzer and my husband ordered the Kona Big Wave, which was served in a super cute mason jar. We ordered monkey bread to start. HOLY CRAP! Absolutely outstanding. It was server in a cast iron skillet with some type of sweet glaze over the top and left me wanting so much more. So good!!!! Definitely can't miss out on ordering that when you go.   My husband ordered The American and some pancakes, which we were surprised came with three pancakes instead of the traditional 2. He loved his meal and scarfed it all down. I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict, which was filled with flavor. It was definitely seasoned a lot with pepper but it was so good. The potatoes we both got with our meals were also so tasty and delish. We were big fans.   Now that we have officially tried this spot, we will DEFINITELY be back. Such a gem. And a new must in our rotation of breakfast and brunch spots.",

This was my idea of average.   On a recent weekday morning, I went with my family and found some flaws in the execution here at the Kitchen Table. To wit:  - A \"pork belly\" benedict made out of chewy, dry shredded pork. It did have a good flavor, but the consistency was about as far from pork belly as one can get.  - A ham crepe with ham that tasted like cardboard  - A yogurt parfait with macerated strawberries that lacked any favor  - An iced coffee that did not come with refills despite being coffee poured over ice  - Hash browns that were about as crispy as a week-old banana  Now, to each their own. I'm sure there are some people who like shredded pork as a stand-in for belly. I'm sure there are those in this world who like the look of a strawberry but not the taste.  And I'll give some credit here, the hollandaise and the English muffin were actively good.   But the brunch, on the whole, left a lot to be desired. A noble effort, and a swing-and-miss delivery.",

The fruit tasted fresh and the melon was amazing. Loved that it was served in a cup and there was so much fruit. I got toast on the side thinking I wouldn't have enough food but those two items were plenty! My friend loved the cream of potato soup and crab po boy. It came with a big chunk of fresh avocado. I'd love to come back and have more things off this menu! I will definitely be returning to this restaurant. I got a crab po boy to go to enjoy later and definitely enjoyed it for dinner that day.",

There is a big breach outside where you can sit and wait for a table. Lucky it was not too packed when we arrived.  The place is newly remodeled and very nice!   Drinks: Guava mimosa! I have never had a guava mimosa before so I thought I try it out. Wow it was flavorful! I very much enjoyed it!   Food: Egyptian with Fiesta chicken sausage. What in the world is that like was my first thought when I was reading the menus. Again, never had anything like it before so I decided to try it! Amazing! The flavors are well paired and it was one of the best toast (not exactly sure what they put on it and I'm usually not a fan of toast but I ate the entire thing)!  Green Chile - the flavor of the poke was really good! And the green Chile itself was amazing!!!!   Customer service was awesome as well. Thumbs up everyone!",

We had an array of dishes, but I had the pork belly eggs Benedict... which had me at \"pork belly\".  The eggs were poached perfectly and paired with the house potatoes made it a delightful brunch on a Thursday afternoon.  Finishing off the meal with their Nutella French toast was totally worth the extra 30 mins on the treadmill.  =)  Because of the local following, be prepared to wait for a moment on the weekends... but worth the squeeze!",

Came in on a Monday around 1030A and it was actually quite busy inside.  My mom and I were seated right away.  The table was against the wall with a couch on the wall side and a chair on the other.   We got our drink orders in quite quickly and were given a good amount of time to decide.  I went with the Croque Madame and my mom went with the All American, no meat.  I appreciate that they offered her fruit upfront instead of her asking (as per usual).  A lot of places won't substitute without a charge.    The food was very good.  My mom's plate was cooked well and they use a really nice sourdough here.  My Croque Madame was ok.  I thought it lacked a little in flavor but it was rich and filling.    I can see why some people might have mixed feelings now that it has been open for a while.  The service is a bit slow and the place needs a bit of a spruce up, especially in the toilets.",

The inside seems very loud and crowded so the option for outdoor seating was nice. The only downfall is the outdoor seating is near the main road so you can hear and see all the traffic but it wasn't too crazy. The menu has some very unique items some classic foods with a twist. I ordered the croque madame and my girlfriend ordered shorty. They do have a fairly large menu but, nothing too complex or overwhelming. The croque madame was mouthwatering! Two pieces of thick bread with cheese and egg in the middle with a tasty white cream sause on top. It also came with a nice lightly seasoned salad to clean your palate from all the creamy cheesy goodness! My girlfriend's shorty was yummy as well but, I only got one bite because we both loved our dishes so much and this is rare ! The service was okay, nothing amazing but, they got the job done. I will surly be paying this place another visit soon !",

The Kitchen Table menu had a lot of Southwest options like tostadas, empanadas, chilaquiles, etc. The restaurant was quaint; it wasn't too busy when we walked in but definitely became more crowded closer to brunch time.  My husband selected the Croque Madame (challah, gruyere, bechamel, thick ham over arugula greens, tomato, topped with a sunny side up egg). He enjoyed this dish and said that the bechamel sauce was really tasty. I went with the Meatless Benedict (poached eggs, avocado, fried green tomatoes, arugula, English muffin, hollandaise) with potatoes. This dish was the biggest disappointment. First and foremost, the \"green tomatoes\" were served red (over-ripe). When I brought this up to our waitress, she mentioned that the chef said the tomatoes turn red when they are cooked, \"they are weird tomatoes\". Moreover, the breading on said tomato was soggy, especially with the egg and hollandaise sauce that was lacking flavor. I would not recommend this dish.  Upon second look at their menu, I think I should've selected one of their non-traditional options. With the number of restaurant options in Vegas, it's always tough to select one but we may return here at some point!",

We both got the Chicken Fried Steak Benedict,  Mark H has had it before but this was my first time ordering this...it was delicious!  It comes on a house made biscuit that was really good. They put the biscuits on the flat top for a second to roast it a bit, really nice touch.  It's topped with a chipotle gravy which is also a nice touch.  Definitely a nice southern themed spin.  The plate's rounded out with some breakfast potatoes.  Kitchen Table is a great breakfast/lunch place in Green Valley.  Definitely don't need the excuse of driving out of town to grab some solid food.",

It is only available on the weekend menu so you kind of have to be careful bc some of the things pictured on yelp might not be offered on certain days of the week. This place gets busy super fast on weekends so prepare for long lines. It is definitely worth it though because the food makes up for all of it.

We definitely would have paid more for our bill! 5 stars !",

They have a wonderful staff amazing food and the Ambiance is beyond great. Not only do they have the indoor seating which is a lot like family style they have an outdoor section with tables both in the open and under canopies with music playing and just wonderful to sit in  when the weather's nice. Again the food is really amazing. They have unique dishes that may not seem to go together but when you try it it's absolutely amazing. If you're in for a great brunch lunch or breakfast, it's worth the drive no matter where you are in Vegas",

    "text": "Listen, I really want to like this place. The food is good (when I get to finally have what I want), the coffee is good, and the location is great. But I have found myself disappointed time and time again. First, and probably the biggest issue, they run out of biscuits every time I go there. Biscuits. At a brunch spot. At 11am and 1pm I get told the same garbage and I can't enjoy biscuits and gravy and multiple other dishes on the menu. The menu is a mile long, it's no wonder they can't prep enough for a full service. Second, the man who I presume is a manager seasons the food right before the dishes go out. He does this without gloves which is fine if that's all he's doing. But unfortunately he opens the patio door, carries small children, and touches customers and chairs and then continues to salt my meal. Lastly, the service is spotty. My boyfriend and I were practically yelled over our entire meal as our server was trying to resolve another customers complaints. Also, it is so packed in there that if you are the unlucky patron to sit by the patio door you are constantly being run into and disturbed because the table is in a terrible spot. Another thing, the music was so loud today I had to yell across my table to have a conversation. Like I said this place has great potential but has some big kinks to work out. Today I just left after my coffee to enjoy brunch at a more consistent spot.",

The hostess was very nice and welcoming. She sat one party in front of us and then sat us. There was also a party after us who was seated shortly after us. This party was a party of two waiting on one other person. Once seated we were never acknowledged, not asked what we'd like to drink, not I'm really busy I will be right with you, nothing. We left once the party after us, who was still waiting for part of their party, was asked what they'd like to drink and served their beverages. There really was no excuse. The establishment was not busy at all! We weren't acknowledged as we left either.",

The wait was 45 minutes or more and the hostess admitted our wait was longer because a friend of the chef showed up with some friends and took our table.  That might not have been a big deal except the restaurant is so small.  There was a singer that was ok but way to noisy to talk in a breakfast place.  Not all the food got there at the same time and we had to start while one person waited almost five minutes for her food.  The food was very good but if I was nitpicking there was very little hollandaise on the eggs Benedict.  They have food to go which is the way to go, since the food is good but everything else brings it down. The service was marginal at best and my friend said the rest room  was a mess!",

My party of 2 was seated quickly.   The service was excellent. We had an appointment we had to make at a certain time. Asked for our check, received it promptly. Drinks were refilled with barely any wait time. Even after signing off on the check, our server came back to make sure everything was still going OK! That is a star within itself.   The food was PHENOMENAL! Believe the hype , it is real. I am from Texas and since moving from there, chicken fried steak is a hard thing to find done right. This place does it well. So well, it is now my second favorite chicken fried steak. My dude ordered french toast. He doesn't normally take food home. He took this home.   Don't be surprise if while eating other tables will talk to you. This place attracts a happy crowd. The only sad thing is they don't do dinner. Yet if you feel like my dude, one specialty is a great thing!",

The decor I thought was homey and rustic.  Our waitress was friendly and did not have an attitude about serving such a large group, which is a frequent experience of mine unfortunately. Before we ordered they gave us some cookies as a \"starter.\" 6 cookies to be exact actually...for a group of 13? I guess I can't complain since it's free but we had to basically pick at them so we all could get some.   I ended up ordering the pork huevos rancheros benedict. Smoked pork, charros with guajillo sauce, salsa tomatillo, corn masa and bernaise sounded like it would be an explosion of bold flavors. The presentation of my dish was actually very beautiful. A friend compared it to a painting. However, the intense flavors I was expecting were not there. The sauces were bland so it didn't add to my dish except make my corn masa soggy. Adding the chipotle hot sauce made it taste much better. Other friends had the same comment on their dishes, \"it was alright.\" One friend's poached egg was actually overcooked as well. No yolk porn.   Despite the hype, the food fell short for me and it's definitely not something I would wait in line for...especially since they don't take reservations.",

We had the pastrami hash and chorizo omelette the pastrami hash was a great dish with great tasting meat and a concoction of peppers and onions and potatoes diced in the skillet. Add some hot sauce and I'm in heaven. The chorizo omelet is quite large and deceptively cheesy. The entire meal comes with toast and potatoes so it's for the hungry for sure. My only issue would be the mimosas aren't cheap at $8 each but they do offer a nice variety. They also offer champagne or beer bucket deals if you want to chill and drink but it will cost you as much as the strip. The food at Kitchen Table is affordable and some of the best brunch options around - we paid $25 for both meals combined. Be sure to sit outside if possible to experience the relaxing patio. There will most likely be a wait though so come prepared to sit around before indulging in great food.",

On a Saturday afternoon, 15-20 minute wait for 2 people: not bad at all. #1 WIN  beautiful, farm-house style open kitchen greets you when you walk in. Fresh flowers everywhere. Visible chefs. #2 WIN   Pleasant waiter with prompt service style and attentiveness. #3 WIN  Now, FOOD...   coffee is GREAT. Breakfast taquitos starter: nice crunchy tortilla, not greasy, yummy filling, nice slaw, excellent sauce, perfect portion for 2. WIN #4  Chorizo omelette: not too spicy, eggs fluffy, chorizo texture appealing. Breakfast potatoes on side were nicely seasoned, NOT salty, and had a good balance of peppers and onions. WIN #5  The all-star in this meal was the ham and cheese crepe with a poached egg. This is by far, the BEST crepe I have ever eaten. It surpassed those eaten across the U.S., in France, in Germany, and in Amsterdam. The texture and thickness of the crepe was spot on, it had a mildly sweet flavor and soft delicate feel to the tooth. The ham balanced nicely with the Gruyere cheese and was julienned throughout the whole crepe, instead of piled in the center. Mornay sauce on top added a \"Je ne sais quoi\" I added a poached egg to the side of this and it was a great touch! Again, perfectly cooked. WIN #6  The chef delivered our food, appetizer and main, which was a wonderful sight and comforting. WIN #7  The whole atmosphere of the place was a reflection of him and the staff: pleasant and inviting. If we weren't so full, I could have sat there and just kept eating.   The Kitchen Table knows what it's doing and it isn't doing anything wrong! Will be back as soon as possible!!",

Though they appeared busy and hectic when we arrived on a Sunday morning, we were seated promptly and Landon began serving us.  I have to say that the staff is very friendly and attentive - and Landon did a fantastic job and his service was excellent.    The food was excellent as well.  My girlfriend got the tacos and I ordered the avocado toast.  Both had an abundance of flavor and the portions were absolutely perfect.  Normally, we like to half our portions and share a bit of each other's entrees, but neither of us wanted to give up a bite, that is how good it was.  I would and will recommend this spot to my friends and family, and we will be returning soon.  It is arguably our new favorite brunch spot.",

    "text": "I don't know what the hell is wrong with people... I don't think they know what quality food is if you're giving it a bad review based on seasoning and saying it's overly salted...there is no salt. Things are seasoned with herbs and spice rubs... I also don't know why people give a 1 star review because there happens to be an item on the menu which you don't like but didn't order...  That makes a lot of sense? Just don't order it...  And stick to reviewing what you actually physically consumed...   Now... Onto the actual review..   Service was chaotic... Too many servers getting lost on what tables are theirs... So it took too long to get our order taken and I waited for over 10 minutes for someone to come back to the table just so I could retell someone I wanted cold press coffee..  However, they're new and work flow will hopefully be tweaked.   Traditional eggs Benedict: The poached eggs were overcooked. The hollandaise sauce was to die for...  I wish there was more. Perfectly seasoned potatoes, and a pastry chef made the English muffin. The muffin was a little too glutinous for my liking but the quality was still excellent. The ham was tender and perfectly cooked. The meal was rich but delicious.  Egyptian: again, the eggs were overcooked. The dressing on the greens was perfect. Seasoning was great. The bread is delicious. I got it with strawberry jam which is a little runny but it's basically a compote. Natural and delicious.  Baked goods: monkey bread was good, I wish the pieces were smaller and the syrup was throughout all the pieces and not just in the top and bottom. Chocolate croissant was delicious.   Overall, this is fine dinning experience for breakfast and it's worth the price... I wish I had one in my neighborhood..  But unfortunately I don't but this business is going places. Good luck, chef Antonio.",

We asked the server what was the most popular item on the menu and she suggested the pork belly Benedict & the country fried chicken Benedict. She also said that anything with pork is delicious. We went ahead and got what she suggested. Also, added a buttermilk pancakes on the side. I didn't like the country fried chicken but I did like the Benedict part. Who wouldn't like eggs right? My boyfriend really liked the pork belly Benedict maybe I just ordered the wrong item. But overall service was good breakfast was good but I'll come back and get something different.",

Sit next to your friends, or even to neighbors you don't know, and just enjoy a unique and delicious breakfast.   The ambiance is great. I guess I'd call it sort of rustic chic. The tables were built and stained by the owners/chefs. There's a stunning vintage server in the front and the chairs are velvety and comfortable.   The coffee is out of this world. What do they put in it to make it so simply perfect?   On our first visit, Chef Antonio came over to introduce us to the concept and the restaurant. He was so welcoming and friendly! The service has been very good, albeit slow at times. But the servers are sweet and attentive.   The food is like no other. Try the nutella french toast. And that monkey bread? To die for! Skip dessert tonight and go have to Kitchen Table tomorrow morning! The pastries are baked fresh on premise. You can smell the bacon cooking out back from a mile away and it calls you closer. Don't worry - there are healthier options available and I should really start choosing them, LOL.   A few kinks to work out service-wise, but this place is going to be a hit around here. Welcome to the neighborhood and I can't wait to make you part of our weekend routine, Kitchen Table!",

They also had great music playing! The atmosphere overall was 10/10. The menu was HUGE! I believe it was 4-5 pages, with everything from Mexican inspired dishes to French inspired food. They also had 10+ varieties of mimosas and even a selection of Kombucha that sounded delicious. I had a peach mimosa (a Bellini) which was delicious! I had the fruit crepes and my friend had the Croque Monsieur. Both were delicious and plated beautifully! I can't remember a time both of us left our plates completely empty-I wiped up every last bit of sauce with my crepe! When the waiter came to ask how the food was, he took a look at our plates & laughed because we finished our food in record time.  The bill came out to less than $30, which was super affordable and worth every penny. I will definitely be back!",

We first ended up at the wrong restaurant in the same plaza, which they served bottomless mimosas (extra points them), however they didn't have crapes on their menu.  After being slightly embarrassed that we weren't at the right place, we went to the other end of the place to The Kitchen Table.   I was excited to see their were crapes, exactly why we went to brunch, but disappointed that there wasn't an endless mimosa option.  Rather a $8 mimosa which I did buy, but wouldn't get a second.   When my friend and I ordered, they got a plate full of what look delicious.   Mine however, the fruit crapes, looked anything but what I was expecting.   To add to the disappointment, my side of bacon wasn't that great either.    On a side note, the staff was friendly, fast and efficient.  But, I don't think I will go again based on my sad sad crape experience.",

Kitchen Table, however, left a good impression on me with their excellent creativity, variety, and great flavors. This is a place worth coming back to, without a doubt. We had the Egyptian, best described as a salad with toast with poached eggs and avocado and bacon. It was really enjoyable and the dressing was excellent. We also had bacon and egg shooters which were not necessarily great but still enjoyable. The lemon poppy muffin was not overly sweet and had excellent texture.  I'm definitely going to have to come back here again to try some of their sandwiches and other breakfast selections, though it is definitely out of the way (and hidden out of the way) and the construction in the parking lot created a lot of dust outside.",

    "text": "After we arrived we were told it would be a 5 minute wait before a table for 2 would be ready. Of course this was fine. I requested to be outside and have a high chair for my son and decided to wait inside in front of the hostess stand to enjoy the ac before moving outside. During my wait, several parties came after me and got seated before me, so after 30 minutes I ran out of patience and asked about the status of our table. It was ready as soon as I asked and the hostess just told me she forgot about us! Remember, I was standing in front of the hostess stand 5 feet away from her all this time! Then she guides us to a table inside and I told her we requested a table outside. She said that they put all the tables together outside to make them available for larger parties, but half of them were empty and when I checked in she did not mention that an outside table would not be an option. Did she just tell me that I did not get what I requested and that I waited for 30 minutes and other parties went in front of me because my check would not be generating sufficient revenue? I did not want to make a big scene and decided to take the table inside, but at that time I already felt so unwanted! As a paying guest in a restaurant! We ordered and ate the food but no matter how good the food could have been, we had a nasty taste in our mouth that would not go away. We ate quickly and paid our bill and went on our way. It's a shame that I did not enjoy this place at all, because we just moved into the neighborhood and usually like to have a \"go to place\" and this is not going to be it. The 2nd star is for the wait staff because they were nice and I can't blame them.",

My mom wanted to take me because she went with her friends and they had a great experience, so naturally I was expecting that too. It didn't take long to get seating despite the huge crowd that was good, yet once seated and once ordered it took almost 30mins to get the food. Ok not so so bad. Yet while sitting there waiting I observed the kitchen staff and must tell you they went against so many health standards in my book I was getting disgusted watching. They were pulling food from the window then putting it back in the window over and over, the expediter was pinching sea salt from a bowl and sprinkling it on every single plate that went out with his hands (uncovered) then grabbing other garnish with bare hands over and over again topping off everyone's order, at one point he actually picked up a piece of food to replace it back on the plate so it \"looked\" more presentable. He had to keep going back on the line to help because they were so backed up, so the next person (waitress, hostess whoever) would come up to expedite and the same thing, grabbing the salt, sprouts and other garnishes and topping everyone's food with bare hands after who knows what they were doing prior.. I was absolutely disgusted and they should know better. After all that my food sucked, whatever spice they thought was cool to put in their hollandaise did not work (don't do it, doesn't work) then my poached eggs were so undercooked they were almost raw.. Too many menu items, not a big enough kitchen to accommodate that many items, kitchen staff didn't have it together and the constant touching with bare hands by anyone who walked up to help was unacceptable. Vegas is a tough town you better get it together or you will just be another distant memory like so many others.",

On top of it staff was just diddling around , chatting with each other and looking at their phones after we and several other people were waiting passed the beyond given time frame . My husband went to ask what the deal was and they gave us another 30 minute more wait time !!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ???!! Bad service ! Get better staffing !!!! Never going back !",

It's a hidden gem tucked in Henderson!  I've tried the Meatless, Vegetarian Hash, Monkey Bread & Mimosas. They were all amazing! I loved the meatless since you get a lot in one bite. The runny egg-porn is instagram worthy. Veggie hash has a lot of potatoes and balances well with the veggies and egg. Monkey bread was a little over welcoming, but shareable so you don't have to eat it all yourself. As for mimosas we've have different flavors that you mix the syrup in your bubbly which is fun, but kind of messy!  Overall, great place for dishes that have a hint of Mexican and American influences!",

Solid five star!! Came here for Sunday lunch. Had to wait about 20 min. I usually don't like to wait but it was worth the wait.  Chopped salad... Ordered this dressing on the side. Very flavorful and tasty even without the garlic vinaigrette dressing.   Crab avocado dip... Delicious!! They put a lot of big chunks of crab meat in it. Nice and creamy taste comes with chips. Must try if you are not watching calories.    Frittata... I asked the waitress what's healthy and she recommended this. It was egg white and lots of veggies. Loved it! Maybe they forgot to put salt?? But it was good since I'm trying to be on low salt low sugar diet when I can. Plus you can always add salt yourself anyways.  Note: I think it's cute to use tin laundry basket as a trash can in the ladies room but the used paper towels and trash was piling up like a mountain (on the floor, too) and I saw some disgusting stuff in there... I thought using the cute tin basket as a trash can for place like this (busy and packed) was not a good idea.",

My sister ordered the chilaquiles, presentation was awesome with the sunny side up egg on top perfectly cooked. The flavor was even better !!   If you like spicy, it does have a kick. Enjoyable. Not to smack in your face spicy.    Along with my crepe I got pork sausage. It was okay, sweet not as savory as other sausages.  Server was dope, pretty and helpful with menu item help !

We decided to go for some birthday brunch.  We dined al-fresco, which is always nice. I ordered the eggs in a basket, the avocado toast, and the berry crepe. The eggs in a basket was completely underwhelming. I was hoping that something amazing was to become of my egg-cooked-in-bread. Alas, it was not to be.   The avocado toast was good. But nothing spectacular. The bacon was crispy, the tomatoes were roasted perfectly, but the avocado smash just did not have the required amount of flavor to make me say \"WOW!\"  The berry crepe was good, although very sweet. Now, I expect a crepe to be sweet, but when I cannot eat the whole thing because it is just too much - some sugar should be removed.  The service was nice, and prompt. The seating was OK, and the outdoor area was well-kept. It just didn't make me say \"I HAVE to have breakfast here again.\"",

From the decor, to the social atmosphere, this place is a hit for all the right reasons.      I heard coming here to make sure to get on the waitlist prior to arrival. For that to work, you must call an hour before you intend to be there to be on the list. Once we arrived it took less than 10 minutes to have our booth ready for us. Our servers name was Brooke, she was quick about getting our orders and helped with getting a cup with a lid so my son (four year old) wouldn't spill. She recommended the pork belly bene, so I ordered, while my best friend ordered the shorty which consisted of braised pork ribs, and my son had the ham and gruyere cheese crepe.      The food came out about 15-20 minutes which was a surprise because the place was packed. The food  was artfully plated and we dove right in Everything was perfectly seasoned and not once did I think about adding salt and pepper. Every component on each dish had a flavor of its own and it truly reminded me of classical French cuisine with a twist. This place is amazing! I highly recommend it for anyone and everyone.      Also a special thanks to the Manager Melanie, she checked on us and was great to talk to! She was very knowledge about the restaurant and created a friendly, fun environment! Thank you so much! We will be back!",

You are hot, your environment is hot, and your food is hot....just no.   There were flies all around us. For the price I am paying to eat out I don't want to have flies buzzing around me. It's a good thing I didn't bring my daughter who screams bloody murder every time she sees a fly. If this was the case outdoors, I wouldn't complain, but indoor setting shouldn't have flies.

All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked phenomenal! Found my new breakfast spot when I'm up. Even with all the great breakfast places in the area, this place shines. Even got my mom to try it after I went & she loves it",

Our party had Some late comers/early departures which they seemed annoyed by, but overall it was a good place for our event.",

Too many new places will allow a once over of the menu to limit your selection to one or two items, with the rest being classic staples or boring options; not here.  Everything looked amazing, and selection was difficult.  I selected the sausage platter as an app with the pork belly bene as my main course. The sausage was cooked to perfection. The dish was put over the top by the pairing of a jaleoeno syrup.   The bene was perfect. The eggs were poached with precision and the bernaise was well balanced. The patatoes were also delicious.   I will be back.",

I'm from Seattle and I can't find many places here that don't feel like a chain...but this place takes me home!    There is a fun little outdoor patio or an intimate indoor area!

Today, on Mother's day, I chose to come to this restaurant for brunch, knowing that I will have to wait a little. We arrived at 11:30AM and were told that the wait is about 45 minutes. fine.  45 minutes turned to over 2 hours !!!!! and no table in the horizon. I have to say that half of the restaurant was empty, and the manager (who couldn't care less..) explained to me that the kitchen is overwhelmed with orders.  I was trying to make reservations the day before but they \" take reservations for party of 8 people or more\" even though, when I was there I was told that a table of 4 was reserved. Bottom line, we left, frustrated and angry. A business that does not respect my time and lie to my face will not see me or anyone I know ever again. Very poor on customer service.",

I had the French toast last time. Didn't care for the flavor. They use a sweeter bread and an amaretto batter. So maybe others will enjoy it, just not for me.   Also they have a great assortment of pastries that they said they make fresh overnight.    Very nice decor and option to sit outside with dogs too I believe.",

We really wanted to try this place so we took our pup home and came back the SAME day. What really irked me was the fact that when we came back, we spoke to the same hostess, and she didn't even acknowledge the fact that we came back without our pup. Maybe it's just me but a little acknowledgement would have been appreciated.   The restaurant is really small so we opted to sit at their patio section. Our server was great and she was on top of everything. They had great food and beverage selections and food was amazing! If this place wasn't so busy, we would definitely come back on a heartbeat.",

My group of 6 and I ordered the Pork Belly Benedict ($15), Meatless Benedict ($11) and Shorty Benedict ($15). We also ordered the Peach Mimosa ($8) and a sangria. I didn't see a bottomless mimosa option but I can see why they don't because no one would probably ever leave! The place it self is quite small but there is also an outside seating available. My party was seated inside and can't image how hot it would be to be outside..  I personally ordered the meatless Benedict and it was to die for-- It was my first time actually having a poached egg and it was perfect on top of the English muffin! A down about my dish was that I didn't get the house potatoes with it but the fruit sufficed.  Major Tip--- call ahead for a reservation or check in online and reserve your seats! We came in at 1030 AM on a Saturday without calling ahead and waited an hour. Though it was a long wait and extremely hot, the food made up for it!",

We were estimated about 30 min. & that was exactly what it was. We were seated at the LONG community table where multiple different parties could sit & get to know each other while eating some good food.   The space of the place is BOUTIQUE size. The decor is HOMEY status &windows to look out everywhere. They even have a HUGE patio area outside w/ cabanas & an area where they grill up all of their DERICIOUS meats! The KITCHEN is wide OPEN.... so you can SMELL & SEE EVERYTHING that is being created.   Our server was patient & informative. It took us some time to come to a verdict of what we wanted to eat. I of course wanted EVERYTHING!! Our table was VISITED by the CHEF/ OWNER ANTONIO which was HONESTLY a nice touch to the whole vibe of the place. He made his rounds to EVERY freaken table to check up on everyone... (uhhh who does that!?!?) A HARD working one OBVIOUSLY.  CHILAQUILES $13.00 - oaxacan cheese, anchor sauce, smoked pork, scrambled egg, black beans, & a sunny side up egg. This reminds me of a breakfast NACHO...  (maybe that's what it is... I just dunno breakfast food) so much flavor & a bite of EVERYTHING in each bite & the runny yolk to give it creaminess.  CREAM OF POTATO SOUP $3.50 - I LOVE cream of potato soups! This is another one on my top list. One thing I wasn't sure if it was on PURPOSE but the potatoes seemed a bit hard... but I typically like soft potatoes. I also got a CUP size... it was served in a HUGE mug ahahahha   CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD $12.00 - hubby ordered this... he wasnlooking for HEALTHY & healthy is what he received! Cabbage, kale, craisan, squash, Bacon, cheddar & oaxacan cheese, corn, cucumber, roasted garlic vinaigrette.  NUTELLA CREPE $10.00 - carmalized banana, toasted almonds, whip cream, nutella, & marshmallow sauce! I added strawberries to it which made it even better. I will have to say though I dunno if I would want to pay $10 for it again... but it was GOOD.   COUNTRY FRIED STEAK 14.00 - initially ordered the crepe as my dish but in my head that is dessert... so I needed a REAL entree. BEST DECISION EVAAA. House breaded steak w/ chipotle gravy served w/ hour potatoes (frealem AWESOME) & 2 eggs.   I gotta come back to try more.... O_O x3",

They said our place in line would be ready at 10:13am. We waited until 10:00am and walked up to the host station to let them know we have arrived for our 10:13 hold. She stated it would be another 45 minutes from 10:00am to be seated. I said we use the Yelp \"join waitlist\" and it said our table would be ready at 10:13am. She said that's not how it works that you have to check in when you arrive and you will then be added to the list. Told her this makes no sense since waitlist is supposed to put our name on the list when we join so we are already in line, not to get here, check in, then be placed on the list. We would have waited almost an hour and a half to be seated when we could have walked in at 9:37, put our name on the waitlist with the host and probably would have been seated sooner.   Not sure if this location or if it was just the hosts that didn't understand how waitlist on Yelp works but I will not be using it again here!",

Our server, Jean, was so nice and patient with us.  She made us feel welcome and waited for our whole group to arrive. All the food was delicious and it was a generous amount of food. We had a variety of muffins, a couple of mimosas, and different types of benedicts.   I would definitely come back. Can't wait to try some of their appetizers and maybe some caviar next time!!",

They have been open long enough that it should be well worked out by now. She told us 30 min when it wound up be a little over an hour, definitely almost left. They said they weren't seating all of outside because they had one server. A lot of people wound up walking out because it seemed inefficient and were then being told wait was hour and 20. I'm glad they are busy, but absolutely they need to communicate better. The hostess called our name finally and from the front door said \"go all the way to the back the one set up for three\"... What? A hostess should walk you to the table not tell you the directions to get to it. Pretty unprofessional, even for a casual atmosphere. As we aimlessly look at each table to see which one open is set for three, we finally found our way  Their menu doesn't list each item that was on my dish either. Not listing sour cream/crema? yuck. I know now to ask for what it really has on it. A more specified menu and communication please. I'd like to come back. I'll probably give it another shot on a less busy day",

I had high expectations for this place based on all the reviews. I ordered the traditional eggs Benny and my friend ordered the veggie frittata. We placed our order and our food came out 5 minutes later. I also asked to add spinach to my Benny and they put a field green salad drenched in balsamic under the poached egg instead. And my dish was swimming in hollandaise and it saturated the cold potatoes. As stated, the potatoes were cold and the ham on my Benny was at fridge temperature. My friend's frittata was raw in the middle, oozing raw egg. I got a new Benny and it came out in a couple minutes, so it was nuked. The chef was cool though, he comped it. My friend also ordered a side of avocado and it took 15 minutes to get it after our food was served. They brought it out on a piping hot skillet and seared the avocado. Also, the service was terrible. Our waiter pretty much forgot about us and I was drinking water from my personal water bottle I carry in my bag since no one came to check on us for over 30 minutes. Then it took an additional 30 minutes to get our check. Such a disappointment! My friend and I will never eat here again. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because my Benny was comped and I liked the ambience.",

    "text": "There are lots of breakfast joints in Las Vegas & Henderson, and they have their signature offerings -- skillets galore, kitchen-sink omelets, kick-butt potatoes, more pancakes than you can shake a maple tree at.  I've now found a place -- Kitchen Table -- where *every* item is special. The food is so varied, imaginative and outstanding that it's not a place you hit on the run while scurrying to Home Depot, but can be a destination to linger over breakfast or brunch with a date.   I had oven-baked French toast battered with granola and resting in swirls of creme anglaise (OK, so I don't know what that is, but it was really good) and accompanied by various offerings of True maple syrup infused with bourbon, vanilla and the like. Hello! French toast like none other, ample and substantial, not some fluffy grilled bread that shreds when the butter is spread. There were other French toast options, like one dipped in amaretto batter and accompanied by seared foie caramelized pears and candied nuts.  But don't take from this review that Kitchen Table is a French toast place. Everything on the menu sounds seductive. Check out the menu at its website. I'm afraid if I swoon much more you'll think i'm a quiet investor in the place. I'm not. Nor do I know anyone who works there (but one of the two chef/owners, Antonio Nunez, did come to our table to explain the menu and offer sugestions.) I'll certainly be back. Home Depot can wait for another day.",

He offered us a rocket mimosa ( champagne with a rocket popsicle ) which we were excited to try. After bringing us the drinks (which did not have a rocket popsicle it was a twist version of a big stick) some customers notice the drinks and wanted to order some. He brings the other customers mimosas and theirs had an actual rocket Popsicle which is no big deal, until he tells the customers that the reason why our Popsicles were different was because ours were leftover and melting in the counter so they were trying to get rid of them, and not to worry theirs were fresh and frozen. I tried not to make it a big deal as I was with my family and was not gonna through a fit in front of them. I was just waiting to see if he was going to apologize because he clearly saw that I had listen to his conversation, but he didn't and he didn't even remove the drinks from the bill. Let me just add that we were Hispanic and the other customers were Caucasian. So how can I not get offended.",

    "text": "I took my mom here for the first time today, and we were absolutely blown away. So much attention to detail is paid to every little thing on the menu. The two chefs, who are also the owners, prep everything on a wooden table which is visible from the main room. As soon as I saw them hand sprinkling sea salt on the dishes I knew we were in for a treat. We ordered the Pork Belly Benedict and the Foie & Apple skillet cake. Both were just out of this freaking world.  They smoke their own pork outside in this giant bbq, so the flavors were just insane. And the skillet cake was so savory and sweet, definitely a must have if you like foie gras. Our waitress Nicole was fun and informative, and definitely added to the experience. She also told us that they get their food delivered daily, so they don't freeze anything! It's so refreshing to go somewhere that is owned by chefs. A lot of the time places will cut corners when it comes to quality, but you can tell they have pride in everything they do here. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This restaurant is usually a rock solid place for brunch with some great food. Original ideas and good comfort foods - from monkey bread, Chorizo Omelet, great biscuits - a solid menu. However, the process in just to get to being served and being able to leave in a timely manner is poor: There is no reasoning behind their poor service. Hard to get seated. Patrons sweating inside, no air conditioning..Then you see a handwritten sign at the front of the door talking about closing early?  Sounds like a diner, not a place that has been considered one of the top brunch locations in Henderson.   This has become a theme - weekend or weekday, hit or miss service. When you are forced to wait, while open seats exist. Then two different dining parties - can sit down next to us, have orders taken, food served, checks cashed out and plates cleared off - before our 4 plates can even be cleaned off the table. It is bad service. Plenty of choices are available to have a great brunch at the same prices with the ability to get in and out.  Sad to say food is great, but service does not match it at all.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place because I've heard good things and the food looks just as good. One disappointment was finding this place. It's literally in the corner of the two buildings in the lot. There's a sign on a wall (that needs a little more to make it stand out) We obviously missed it and ended up driving into the next lot. We then saw the main sign when we were on the street. Sooo for future reference: it's between a Shabu-Shabu restaurant and Brighton Family Medicine.   We walked in and it was surprisingly small and packed in there. We came at 9am, thinking it was going to be a bit more empty... Nope! People like eating early lol. Despite how busy it was, we were seated immediately. I wasn't too thrilled with our server, I don't even think he introduced himself. But he did check on us a couple times and made sure we had what we needed before disappearing.  It was packed in there and just as loud. I could barely hear myself or my sister talk. That's where the fifth star went -- disappeared with my unheard words.   The food is where the four stars came from, though! There was a lot to choose from, everything sounded delicious! I ended up with the country Benedict. Pretty much country friend steak just on a biscuit with a side of house potatoes. The house potatoes reminded me of Thanksgiving stuffing because of how it looks but it tastes better lol.   I'm coming back to try other things (monkey bread!!!) and maybe sit outside to be one with nature -- sucks it was super windy today and I would've died from allergies.   I definitely recommend trying this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant!",

    "text": "This was my second visit to this place.  Both times, the wait time was excessive due to the fact that they do not have an adequate sized facility to accommodate the business that they attract.  While ordering, we were advised that they were out of numerous items on the menu, which caused us to have to rethink our choices several times.  We were also told that the espresso machine had just gone down; so, any menu item that required the use of that machine was not available.  All of the items that they were out of or not able to prepare really limited the choices on the menu.  Extremely frustrating to think we waited awhile only to be told we could not have what we wanted on the menu.  I ordered the French toast, but requested that it be made with gluten free bread instead.  The first bite of my French toast revealed that every piece was really burnt; and, they had used the old kitchen trick of turning the burnt sides down on the plate.  The sad part is that they didn't even offer to replace my burnt toast when they saw me taking the photo of it.  Sad because this place has so much potential because most of the creative menu items (when available) are really good.  It's just very poorly managed all the way around.  This is not somewhere I'd recommend to any of my friends having had two bad experiences out of two.",

The server always checked to see if we needed anything else, but not so much that it was annoying. When we were ready to pay we thought you had to go up cause we saw the table next to us do that, but the server made it a point to tell us we don't have to. He said that they don't want anyone to feel rushed to leave, which was nice. I always find it annoying when servers bring the check 5 min after we get our food.  Food: we got biscuits to start because we were starving. I liked them with the jam and honey. I would def recommend, especially since they're only $3. My boyfriend and I shared the monte Cristo and country Benedict. The country Benedict was so good and definitely different from other ones you've had. It looked so good that the table next to us had to ask what we got. The chipotle gravy on top was a really nice topping. My boyfriend loved the monte cristo. He felt like the bread was similar to a donut and it had a good balance of savory and sweet. Definitely will be back to try some other dishes here!",

    "text": "My incredible girlfriend decided to surprise me this morning by going to a new breakfast place. I'm not sure how she found it but this is Godsend. Yet again, I'm not a fan of many restaurants serving \"breakfast\" in Las Vegas but lately, I've been taken aback.   From the parking lot, this place seemed a bit hidden. I mean, not a lot of things were happening around there and it seems a bit off to place an eatery next to places without competition. Well, now that I think about it, that's pretty damn genius. Nonetheless, we found it hiding in the corner adjacent next to a large banner placed along the plaza's planters. How we missed it, I do not know.   I was afraid that they'd accommodate a large waiting list on a Saturday morning but to my surprise, I was wrong. Both the inside and patio had a high volume of guests but we were seated right away. By 9 AM, hardly anyone was seating in the dining area as most patrons decided to enjoy their meal outside. Well, it was a beautiful day.   Anyway, enough babbling! The food was delicious. And I feel like that was an understatement. The scrambled egg with duck and mac and cheese just took the words out of me. Whoever thought of it is a pure genius, and whoever cooked it was a culinary talent. The eggs were soft and fluffy but the flavor from the cheese along with the texture of the duck was out of this world. It's a must try.   I had the pleasure of trying the country steak egg Benedict which was not something I normally do. Still, it seemed like it was a popular entree so I went along with it. My issue with Benedict is the runny yolk that tends to turn me off. However, Kitchen Table really understood the robust flavors they needed to incorporate in the dish so that all ingredients worked well together. First, the Benedict was doused in house sauce which was creamy and delicious. Then you're almost tasting breaded steak is really not something I would consider but it worked. Bite it with the egg and you're in for a treat. It was truly a remarkable dish to say the least.   I was telling my girlfriend that I wish there was a cafe and a breakfast placed mashed together so you're enjoying delicious latte with your meal. Coincidence or not, this restaurant had everything I was asking for and more. They had a small selection of drinks like snickerdoodle latte, Oreo latte, Mexican Hot cocoa, etc.. Still, having the choice instead of a regular coffee was a great change. Okay, but really though, those beverages hits the soul as inventive as they may seem. God, I would do anything to take a Mexican hot cocoa any day of the week.  Also, the monkey bread was amazing. It comes placed in a warm skillet ready to be pulled apart to your heart's desire. Its not overbearingly sweet but enough to satisfy the sweet tooth. Sticky and gooey? Indeed.   I could go on and on about Kitchen Table from their fast, friendly service to the ambiance in the room. But I really want you all to try it so do whatever you need to do get there!",

I'm giving them 5 stars despite the wait (20 mins) which was understandable because it was a Sunday and people were hungover.   Got there around 11:30 with friends and waited roughly 15 mins for a table.  The decor inside is very homey and welcoming. We looked over the menu while waiting outside so we already knew what to order as soon as we sat down.   We started off with the avocado toast as an appetizer and we decided to treat ourselves with a pitcher of guava margarita. I went to silent mode after the first bite. I knew right then that I made the right decision getting the pork belly benedict.   Our orders: burger, pork belly benedict, pork belly chilaquiles and regular benedict. My benedict was out of this world bananas good. The chilaquiles was good too, but mine was cooked more as bbq. The burger was bomb, but I would suggest for there to be more meat.   Despite those little setbacks, I'm giving them 5 stars because the food is fantastic. I'm fairly certain everything else on the menu is equally delicious.   Do yourself a favor and stop by here on your way out of Vegas. You won't regret it.",

The food was good as well. I had the duck omelet because \"why not.\" It was good and was sauteed in a white gravy over eggs. The breakfast potatoes was good as well. The only thing I didn't like was the avocado crab dip. They used imitation crab meat which I hate. I am a southern girl I rather the real thing. Other than that it has great ambiance and good service. Also you must try the Jalapeno bacon it was the best part!!",

Call ahead or put your name on the list through the yelp app, there's always at least a 20-30 minute wait (not a huge place)   Come here and try the Short Rib Benedict with a peach Mimosa - you won't regret it!",

Or maybe the beautiful setting that they have outside. No doubt, it looks like a beautiful place to have brunch but not after you find out there is an hour wait!  Or that one crab cake was $15! Or how about a crepe that was (I think) around $12?! I honestly was still hungry when we left this restaurant.  The food was tasty, but not worth the price. Although I must note that when you order a coffee, it comes in a huge soup bowl! I thought that was pretty cool.  Or if you don't mind prices but are looking for a cool place to catch up with friends, this place would definitely be it. Don't forget to \"skip the line\" with yelp!",

There is a small indoor dining area, and a super cute patio that has heaters for cooler weather and umbrellas for when it is warmer. On the day we came (a Sunday morning) there was a gal performing songs live with a keyboard. Their mimosa menu was quite extensive but I didn't have any the time I went - I'll have to come back again and try one next time! We ordered the taquitos and monkey bread to start off with, which were both excellent. Everyone at our table seemed to really enjoy their main dishes. I got the avocado toast which was very filling and delicious. It was a little spicy for my taste so next time I would ask them to keep the spice away. I also think this place is very reasonable with pricing and you get good portions. When I order avocado toast at other places, it's more than $20 and is only one piece of bread (i.e.: Yard Bird at the Venetian). Here, it was only $12 and the portion size was twice as much! I think I would like to come back mid-week when hopefully the wait isn't so long. The food is really good and the service was nice and speedy. But just hard to want to come back on a weekend knowing that you'll have to wait quite a bit to get a table (I think we waited 45+ minutes for ours). A nice addition to the Henderson / Green Valley dining scene for sure! I'll definitely be coming back!",

Our server Brooke was fantastic and attentive, and took great care of us. The manager Melanie came over to check on us and we had a great, genuine conversation with her. She sat down and we exchanged stories and laughs, which was a breath of fresh air from the constant \"get them in get them out\" food service mentality.  How could I forget to review the food! I ordered a peach mimosa which was fabulous, their coffee was so smooth and sweet already it didn't need any additives, and the country fried eggs Benedict was out of this world. Almost everything was made in house, including the biscuits and gravy which were the best I've ever had. At one point I literally said \"I wish my mouth was bigger so I could eat more. If I could give this place 100 stars I would. Can't wait to come back!",

When you walk in you're greeted by a collection of fresh and perfectly-sized pastries (muffins, donuts, coffee cakes). You're a guest, better yet, treated like FAMILY...and you're sure to return for another morning. I wouldn't want to start my day any other way! Try the almond-cran muffin, the walnut maple donut, and/or the coffee cake - nothing here disappoints.",

Then we had a pineapple and guava mimosa. I preferred the guava over the pineapple. My boyfriend had the chilaquiles which was a blend between perfection and spicy. The pork was so tender. I had the tacos huevos which was beautifully presented and tasted just the same. We shared the jalapeno bacon, I have NEVER tasted bacon so good before. The people sitting next to us were friendly. We had conversations with everyone around us. True breakfast joint. My compliments to the chef, who comes out to the tables and ask what your opinion. I was blown away by the service and food.   Will most definitely return. I can't wait to try everything on the menu, which is also unique. Ask about the chef's story.",

You can tell that Kitchen Table uses the best stuff. Their food just tastes better. Anyone who is a food snob knows that I'm talking about. When you consume a lot of locally sourced ingredients, the other stuff just tastes bad.   The staff was also pretty great. My girlfriend and I stumbled in after an all-night dance party and the hostess bemused us, asking questions about our night.   All in all, a very delightful and surprising experience. This California girl is discovering that Vegas has some pretty good local eats and Kitchen Table is one of them.",

I had the pork belly Benedict and it's by far one of the best I've ever had!  The flavor was phenomenal and I HIGHLY recommend it!       The service I wish I could see say the same. It took almost 10 minutes to be acknowledged by our server today. I get it, it's Sunday brunch, they're busy, but as someone who used to serve for many years, how hard is it to say, \"hi guys, I'll be right with you.\" ???  That alone takes a star away automatically for me. Other than the slow initial greeting our server was not very attentive and hardly checked on us, she didn't even check on how our food was. The numerous bussers roaming around checked on us more. I'm super laid back and would never complain to a manager about something so trivial but a lot of reviews mention the lack of actual servers on the floor. It seems like a place as busy as this, and being a \"turn & burn\" breakfast/lunch spot they would have at least one more server. The faster people get acknowledged, orders in, they eat, and pay, that's another table sat and money in the server's and restaurant's pockets.  Seems pretty simple.       It's pretty far from us, we live in the southwest, but I wouldn't be opposed to the occasional drive for the pork  belly! If you aren't pressed for time I definitely recommend this place for brunch.",

I called the busboy over who was closeand asked if they still had the fried chicken even though it wasnt on the menu.  He told me just a moment and a minute later a gentleman came and sat down by us. He explained he was very sorry they don't have fried chicken never have. Turns out he was the owner and he gave me a suggestion for trying the chicken fried steak. He said it's made with filet mignon.   We thanked him and said we would find something to eat on the menu even though what we are hungry for was really fried chicken we stayed.  I'm really glad we did!  I always check out the restroom first before I order to see how clean it is and his was spotless.  Second there were so many things to choose from the menu it would be impossible for somebody not to find something that they would like. I did order the chicken fried steak and it was delicious.  The place closes at 3 PM so be prepared. It's mostly a breakfast place although I did see sandwiches on the menu and a cheeseburger.The waitress was so genuinely nice.The place was very busy and it is out-of-the-way little joint  but obviously they have a lot of loyal customers. They have a patio area if you want to sit outside or you can sit inside very comfortable seats. It's on the corner of Valley Verde and Horizon Ridge in Henderson! Considering what they offer on the menu and the quality of the food I can't believe such reasonable prices!  If you're looking for a quaint small little restaurant with awesome food great prices great customer service check them out.  Very happy to a found this awesome little place! I do not know anyone working there, I did not receive anything for free while we were enjoying our lunch nor have I been compensated to leave them a good review!",

I ate it, but not happy. I think I was tasting burnt sugar, I guessed that they may have cooked in balsamic vinegar, which may have enough residual sugar to burn. My wife had crepe with fresh fruit, the fruit was under ripe, the crepe didn't impress. Great staff, unskilled cook, attractive place. May try again because of their intriguing menu.",

So today I called at 12 pm arrived at 1pm the hostess told me that they were waiting to seat a table of eight and they were backed up... ok so we stand in the corner full of other people also waiting for tables. 15 minutes go by I check in and am assured that my name is at the top of the list. They start seating some of the people around us who have been waiting. 30 minutes  go by I again check with the hostess and was told the owner is making them seat people ahead of us because of business deals and they are doing as told in order to keep their job.  Another 15 mins go by after they seat a party of six who arrived after us and we finally sit down. A grand total of 1 hr 45 mins of waiting...This is a terrible way to run a business",

Our group has come here twice and we have shared so many amazing dishes it is hard to pick a favorite. My kids love the monkey bread and the stuffed French toast. We have tried the chicken fried steak egg Benedict and the short rib benefit, grapes, chicken sandwich and the croque madam.  Best thing we ate hands down was the short rib Benedict. Love that they have fresh orange juice and champagne/mimosas. Only downside is the wait (but what do you expect for a place this good) and no bloody Mary's. Love the open kitchen where you get to see the chefs, the outdoor patio seating and the music is on point.",

    "text": "Came here for Mother's Day. Based on the food and service once we were seated this place gets five stars. It was amazing, truly! Free refills on the mimosas, bonus! I had the French toast with foie gras and OMG was it tasty! Their bourbon maple syrup is delicious!! My mom had the croque madame and said it was great!  Now for the bad. We knew it would be busy on Mother's Day and they don't take reservations. We showed up 30 minutes after they opened and it was packed with a crowd inside and out. We were told the wait would be 30-50 minutes. At 30 minutes I checked to see how much longer it would be and was told it would only be another 10 or 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I checked again with the hostess, at which point she lost her sh*t. She actually told me \"It's just me. I don't have time to seat people because I have to stand here (at the hostess stand).\" You see, at no point in an hour long period did she (or any servers) ever come outside to get anyone waiting and seat them. And there had been empty tables since the moment we arrived. Clearly she didn't understand her position. Anyway, I asked for the manager and ended up talking to who I believe was the owner and I calmly explained the situation. Immediately, the hostess had some help from 3 other people plus the owner and people were getting taken care of. Once we were seated, everything was flawless. And to top it off, the owner gave us a complimentary plate of empanadas to enjoy as an apology for the wait. Very respectful and appreciated.  I will be back here again, but might bring snacks for the wait. :)",

The wait was less than 5 minutes and the staff was very polite and attentive.  As I was seated along side wall on the couch I noticed how close the tables were so I was so scared I would knock someone's drink as I squeeze my way in between tables to sit on the couch.  So if you have a big purse or jacket, beware! The menu is reasonably priced for brunch and they have a great selection.  We decided in the prickly pear mimosa, house coffee and some monkey bread to start.  All very delicious! Our main course was the pork belly benedict and the avocado toast. Everything came out quick and it tastes good. I say good not great cause my pork belly had some very tough parts, not what I expected since it is \"belly\" but I would say half my Benedict was tough meat.  Made me chew quite a bit which was disappointing. Other than that the servers always refilled our water without us asking and checked on us regularly.",

Although, this did not happen. First of all, they had no A/C so it was very hard to enjoy the meal. The drinks were no help either as the water was room temperature. I had the blue collar with scrambled eggs, house potatoes, toast, and sausage. The eggs, potatoes, and sausage were very dry. I feel like the potatoes were not seasoned enough either and it gave a weird taste. It seemed like it was supposed to be spicy but it didn't come off as strong as intended. I feel like the toast was the most delicious thing on my plate. My mom had the shorty and said she wasn't very pleased. Overall, this is not the ideal place to choose to eat.",

This allowed us to get seated within 5 minutes of our arrival otherwise it would have been about 30 minutes wait. The food was amazing. All 4 of us left there saying we would definitely return, and soon. We got to meet the chef after dinner and he was extremely gracious and friendly. When told that 2 in our party had birthdays, he was disappointed that we didn't let us know. He then invited us back tomorrow so that he could do something special for us. Looks like we will be heading back tomorrow as well!!!!  Had a second visit here on Sunday that was even more amazing. The staff and owner really do make you feel like you are part of the family. They remembered us from the day before and wished my wife and son a Happy Birthday. The food was once again amazing. I had the Country Bene which was fabulous. We also had a fruit crepe as an appetizer. One person actually had lunch and got the pastrami sandwich which was very tasty.

    "text": "Really welcoming and hip rustic atmosphere. Great to have an upscale casual brunch spot that isn't on The Strip. Service is extremely helpful and professional. The place gets busy really quick and there is somewhat limited seating, so the family dining table is nice to utilize the space and you can meet some new people too. Menu is creative, but it's backbone is American fare. Their benedicts come highly recommended and I decided to go with the Country Style Benedict with potato hash. It has a Southwestern spice to it, but it was really good. The biscuits underneath the eggs were fluffy and soaked up the sauce well. Our waiter was very polite and easy going. Checked to see how were doing and was very prompt with refilling our drinks. The crab and avocado cheese dip was also a highlight at Kitchen Table. I personally could have used more chips on the side, but not too big of a deal. The dip was super creamy and cheesy. Chunks of crab and half sliced avocado rounded out the flavors. The Monte Cristo was not too greasy and the Parisian ham was a nice thick cut. It was also drizzled with a fresh puree strawberry sauce which worked well all together. They also sell baked goods like muffins on to left side when you walk in. Overall, good service, great food, and cool atmosphere. Will be back to try more brunch yum yums.",

They were out of pellegrino and monkey bread which I was sad about. instead we ordered a biscuit, kale salad, empanadas, and crab po boy. the biscuit in my opinion had too much butter. the po boy was not what we expected. the filling was cold and prepared in a sort of tuna salad style mixture. i was expecting actual fried crab, but the roll it was on tasted good. The kale salad was good, but was missing the blue cheese that the menu stated it contained. The empanadas were by far the best thing we ordered. had it not been for the good service and the delicious empanadas and the fact that it's 5 minutes from my home I don't think I would try this place again. But, I did spot quite a few breakfast items I would like to give a chance, so we will be back with the kids for breakfast some day soon.",

My boyfriend and I started with the Monkey Bread \"starter\" which was delicious. Good for two people, maybe up to four if you all just want a little bite of something sweet. Both of us got plates with Pork Belly (Pork Belly Benedict and Pork Belly Green Chilie) which was cooked to perfection. They have a smoker outside so it's very evident they put in a lot of time to make sure that Pork Belly is on point. Neither of us finished our plates because we didn't want to be uncomfortably full, but we totally would have because the food was that delicious.  I'm looking forward to returning to try other things on their menu that looked amazing as well!",

It is definitely one of the best things that I have eaten in a very long time.  My husband ordered the crab cake po' boy and that was also very good and a generous portion. He says that he'd order it again, so, I guess he loved it!  I was bummed that they were out of pastries, but it was also already almost 2pm so I will have to show up earlier next time. We did get a chance to try the biscuits and those were perfect.  I had a special treat (Mexican hot chocolate - turned into a mocha by adding espresso) and it was delicious. Anyone who loves spicy/sweet combo should try it!

I can, and have, brought guests from all walks of life, and everyone has left happy and full.   My favorites are the chopped salad, the egg white veggie frittata, the tortilla soup, the empanadas, the turkey bacon club, and the monkey bread. They also have a great offering of mimosas, and will mix the juice for you (cranberry pineapple for the win!)  The egg white dish is really unique because they use a whipped cauliflower puree on top that resembles a bechamel, without the guilt. Brilliant!!  The only negative aspects can be found if you are dining on the patio. While I enjoy smoked meat, the smoker is overpowering and I have left smelling like woodsmoke more than once, and had to go home and take a shower and change clothes.   Also, service seems to be far less consistent on the patio...as in, you can expect to not receive as much attention from staff if you are sitting outside. I've sat outside as many times as I've sat inside, different time of day, and days of the week, and this has been an obvious difference each visit. Don't fret though, your frustrations will (probably) subside when you get that side of their jalapeno bacon.",

I definitely have my favorites like the huevos tacos with jalapeno bacon, chili Colorado (brunch), and always the Greek yogurt parfait.   Sarah, the manager, is awesome. She is so fun and very knowledgeable with drinks. Definitely try her new watermelon spritzer and pear elixir, both delightful with the summer heat.",

We got mimosas and a michelada. For an appetizer we got the bacon and eggs which was sooooo yummy and worth it, and the main dishes we both got benedicts! He got the brisket I believe, and I got the salmon. Both were really good (egg was cooked perfectly) but I would go salmon any day. Both were served with potatoes and was a really filling breakfast for the two of us. If you're ever in the area, I'd say give it a try! Nothing beats local food spots!",

The French toast had an awesome whipped cream, but the toast itself was a little more soggy than I'm used to. Our waiter was awesome.  Large parking lot and the restaurant is always packed. I checked in for the Yelp reservation wait-list at 12:17pm and it told us to check in with the host by 12:47, and we were there by the time. When we got there the hostess told me about another 30-45 mins, but I showed her our check-in time on Yelp, so she said 15 more mins. We weren't seated until 1:25pm, which is why I dropped a star. They should have more accurate timings bc the waiting area is cramped and people are getting there on time.",

    "text": "Yesterday was my first time at Kitchen Time, and I'm definitely returning!  First off, the name is simple yet welcoming because I think of all the times I've had great food and loud laughs with family and friends at the \"kitchen table.\" Secondly, I personally found the decor SUPER ADORBS! There are hanging antique light bulbs in the order to-go cafe area, an antique cupboard, beautiful 3D flower wall art, and the patio area looked cute from where I was sitting inside. It can get pretty cramped inside, especially when people are lingering in the walkways, but I don't mind it.  Now on to the food - my favorite part!  For my boyfriend and I, one section of the menu seemed a bit disorganized because we were pretty sure that the items were separated by category (such as French Toast) and should be read from left to right. There was a burger item under \"French Toast\" that had us thinking it was going to be served between french toast, which would've been unique, and my boyfriend said that the eggs benedict items went into the \"French Toast\" category as well. It didn't spoil our experience, just thought I'd mention it for future improvements.  Besides that, the food was THE BOMB. If I can remember the names correctly, my boyfriend ordered the \"Pork Belly Bene,\" I ordered the \"Salmon and Caviar\" and \"Strawberry Shortcake French Toast\" (only served on weekends told by our server), and \"Crab Dip\" as our appetizer. I only took photos of the appetizer and my dishes because my boyfriend couldn't wait to eat his! Everything was DELICIOUS. The \"Crab Dip\" was super cheesy, which made it really oily, but we didn't care. It came with a few slices of avocado, but it could've used more because I love avocado. The chunkiness gave it some texture, which was nice. There wasn't too much crab where it made it too fishy either, which was perfect because my boyfriend has a sensitive sense of smell. The \"Salmon and Caviar\" was beautiful. The smoked salmon, sunny side up quail egg, touch of caviar, and greens on top of a small pancake was just amazing. The French toast blew it out of the water for me! The bread was so moist and soft. Presentation - just gorgeous. The strawberry coulis was a tad tart for my taste, but overall I enjoyed it! My boyfriend's \"Pork Belly Bene\" was a bit too sweet for his taste. The description said chipotle and jalapeno, so he was expecting some heat. He still enjoyed it, but we recommend updating the description because it's a bit misleading. We definitely ordered a lot, so we brought home leftovers, which my sisters happily finished. Service was kind and friendly. Definitely bringing my sisters and mom here for a brunch date!",

My little sister is here for the weekend from San Diego and on her first day in town, we take her to Kitchen Table. Upon arrival we saw the magnificent Arely, location manager and she came out to the waiting area outside with brunch Mimosas for me and my party. This is a great surprise! She made a statement to us by this gesture that she will take good care of us during this visit.  When we sat on our table, Arely personally approached us with a bucket of a full Champagne bottle and two juices for more Mimosas! This arrived immediately before we even placed our orders. Wow!  Nicole, our hostess is very friendly and she gave my sister and I great recommendations for our brunch meal and her recommendations did not disappoint! What a marvelous woman, Nicole is. When you chance visit Kitchen Table, ask to be seated where Nicole is and you will be taken care of. Our food are delivered immediately and each dish are flavorful with the right amount of seasonings and garnishes. Yummmy!  Needless to say, we are happy and content patrons whi will definitely keep coming back!  Service and food at its best! Recommendation and satisfaction guaranteed !",

We had the frittata & benedict... Both super fresh & delicious. Average plate of breakfast cost $10-$14. They have Foie breakfast options, too if you want a little more upscale of a breakfast at $19-$21 a plate. I don't eat meat so the meatless dishes were perfect for me.   Definitely an awesome breakfast joint with great random tunes playing in the background. Check them out. (:",

The chicken fried steak on the country Benedict was a bit chewy, but the rest of the flavors are amazing. Really enjoyed the pork belly Benedict. Jalapeno sauce really kicked it up a notch and the pork belly was perfectly cooked. The crab cake was delicious, but not the best I have ever had. Foie gras, how can you go wrong. I could eat that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Mexican hot chocolate was a sight to see. Beautiful to the eye, but was over saturated with chili pepper flakes. The flakes killed the experience for me. First time I ate here I had a female server who provide great friendly service with a smile. However, the second time I ate here I had a male server that was very off putting and killed the entire experience for me. We asked for sugar for the coffee and his reply was, \"do you want me to get it now or do you want me to take your order?\" Never did get the sugar and finally had to ask the hostess who was seating people to bring us sugar. Then the server kept giving us dirty looks. Thinking that maybe it was just our table, I looked around and noticed other tables pissed off with the same server. Having driven across town and filled with excitement, I felt very let down and will probably never go out of my way for this place ever again!",

The manager Melanie had treated us to some sampling of a pie and chatted with us a bit about the menu, her favorites and introduced us to the chef. I was extremely impressed and I hadn't even sat down yet. Melanie had recommended the Country Benedict, so I gave it a shot. WOW! This was amazing!! This place is an absolute MUST! Plus you can throw foie grais on just about anything you want. The service here was absolutely flawless in every way from start to finish. The food was flawless.

After getting some mid morning drinks in me I then moved on to the tostadas for an appetizer, they were damn good with a great combination of flavors. For the main course I got the Green Chile Pork Belly, great portion size and an excellent pairing of flavors. There are few things I love in this world and brunch is towards the top of the list, if you're anywhere in the Las Vegas area this place is worth the trip to come and check it out. Little chilly right now hit the outside patio area looks like a great place to have a Sunday brunch get together.",

I had heard the wait take a while on Sundays, so I called ahead and was placed on the waiting list before we left. It was quite crowded and the wait for walk ins was about 45 minutes, but we only had to wait about 10 since we had called ahead. Once seated we immediately ordered cocktails and some monkey balls. Both were delicious!  For the meal my friend ordered the frittata and I ordered the avocado toast. Both were excellent.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was very cozy and the staff was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be returning soon!",

The menu i received was ripped paper stapled to each other lol So I decided to get the chilaquiles , The shredded pork was pretty much shredded fat. I didnt expect it since they show off their smoker, in the patio. I thought it would be better tasting, Other than that , the only thing i liked that i ordered was probably the over priced orange juice and my water. I think the omlet house is way tastier than this place. If you want a real breakfast dont bother to come here, but if you want to act rich and stuck up , you can come to this place. :) but your food will probably taste not so good. oh well , at least it was a nice area.",

    "text": "Oh man is this place amazing!! I was recommended by a friend to check out Kitchen Table and it was the best food decision I ever made! I've been here countless times for brunch. They also serve lunch here. I've only tried their breakfast items so I can't speak for their lunch but if it's anything like their breakfast then it's amazing.  They are only open until 3 so this is a breakfast/lunch place only. It's pretty small so expect to wait, especially on the weekends. Trust me, it's worth it. You can always order a mimosa or coffee while you wait. It's the most unique restaurant I've been to in a long time. You know the service is great when you finish your water and literally within seconds the waitress magically appears out of nowhere to fill up your glass when the restaurant is packed.  Okay now to the food.. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOh.my&s=98edab0cb2c458afb9b59a25bbadcf0054149a3363212accbb9e496ac87121c5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oh.my</a>.god. I apologize if I butcher the names... I've had the Egg Mac Kitchen which puts any breakfast sandwich to shame, the croque madame (my absolute favorite) and breakfast tacos (they're not called breakfast tacos but they were tacos). Literally everything I have had I love. I'm one of those people that likes to snoop on other tables and see what they ordered and everything on their plate is absolute perfection. I can't express enough how great this place is.  Let's not forget the mimosas! They have a ton of flavors that actually taste like the flavor! There are so many places that say Oh this is a blackberry mimosa, then it tastes like a glass of champagne and water. Not here! They actually taste like champagne and blackberry! They also have peach, Cranberry, pear, and a ton more.  You seriously need to try this place. I haven't brought one person here that didn't fall in love.",

I stopped by this place on purpose while headed in that direction from az bc of the great reviews (it's currently headed on a slow spiral down as of the day of this writing). Arrived early Father's Day and there was a line starting at 7 in the morning. Good sign since they open at 7:30. Greeted at opening from one of the owners, nice. Inside is small. But that's ok. Patio space is nice. And bigger than indoor space. Here is what was ordered and breakdown on food.   Chorizo omelet: disgusting but we chalk it up to maybe we did not like the chorizo ??  Pb j pancakes: tasty but where is the on and barely any jelly  Burger: my son says it was good but nothing he want to purposely return for. Nice that they were able to serve him a burger 7:30 in the morn  Pork belly Benedict: pork belly tasted good but there was so much inedible fat. Gross hollandaise , 2 pieces of mesclun lettuce (confusing) , poached egg was however perfect, best part was the English muffin bottom. Over all icky  Hot chocolate was just ok  Crumb cake was better than average and if you're there I would order one  Bathrooms were sad. Toilet paper roll holder broken. Garbage can was a wicker fabric lined basket thing and the liner was dis colored.   I was so disappointed that I waited for this place to open. I would not return even if I lived in this area. I am honestly confused by the reviews unless maybe they were better before. We ordered a variety of items and it wasn't just one that sucked.   I also want to say that our waitress was very nice and attentive. And the one owner was obviously very nice too. But the food and bathroom was a no no.",

My dad ordered the Meatless Benedict which has fried green tomatoes, a poached egg, avocado, etc and comes with fruit. I didn't try it, but he said he enjoyed it.   Service was good overall, I think our waitress was a bit difficult to flag down at times, but I don't really remember so it must not have been that significant.

At first glancing at the menu just knew that it was a place for my wife and not me, but surprisingly I had a very good experience and delicious food. I had the biscuit and gravy, sausage selection, and Pork Belly Benedict which were all delicious but the Pork Belly was phenomenal! Now my wife went with the Empanada, Monkey Bread, and Avocado Toast your more healthy side, and it was bad, but what do you expect with a healthy selection (HAHAHA). However we were very pleased with the service (Rapheal, very courteous, and knowledgeable), atmosphere, and presentation of food (definitely something that you would expect to find only on the strip). Though the wife may not had a good experience with the food, it's important that the man paying the bill is HAPPY  Regardless would recommend anyone to try this place. It got 4 out of 5 because I had to deal with the consequences",

I've been here a few times in the last year and a half and each time I've walked thinking to myself it wasn't worth it.   The whole place feels tired to me.  From the menu to the food and the restaurant itself. We were handed 2 menus you could barely read due to being so worn out.    We sat outside and there is a shed that looks like it came from an episode of Stranger Things (from the 1980s)  with used kegs visible behind it.    The food, that also seems to have taken a turn.  We ordered the heavily recommended pork green chile and a po boy.  The pork green chile had minimal pork and zero salt which meant no flavor.  The po boy was unexceptional and felt like a mistake while odering it, but for $15 it should still have redeeming value of some sort.  The po by came with a \"green tomato salad.\" Yea, it had 4 tiny pieces of tomato on some greens.   It's unfortunate, but for a $45 brunch for 2 in this town the options are limitless.",

    "text": "This place is hard to find, tucked away in a corner of an unremarkable little commercial development.   Find it.  You will not regret spending the time to locate the Kitchen Table.  Love this place.  The menu is different and amazing with a strong Hispanic influence.   This is not your regular \"egg and potato\" hash house.  The menu has been thoughtfully prepared, the food is fresh and full of flavor and the presentation is pretty enough to take a picture of it.  The Kitchen Table is a small restaurant and seating is \"intimate\" (meaning close to each other).  The menu is remarkable.  Fresh baked pastries are delicious.  The uniquely prepared and presented food items are fresh, not run-of-the-mill, unique combinations that are not to be missed.   Service is attentive and friendly.  The only \"dings\" I can tell you about is that seating is tight and the coffee isn't as good as it could be - its not awful by any means, but the coffee doesn't live up to the amazing food, hence 4 stars instead of 5.  There are pastries, delicious plated breakfasts unlike anything you will find elsewhere.  My favorites include a marvelous  pork green chile  with house potato, pork green chile, two poached eggs, cilantro onions with lime and corn tortilla chips .    Only on Sat and Sun can one experience the flavorful chili colorado braised pork, mexican chilies, charred tortillas, lime cilantro onions, pickled radish, pickled jalapenos, served in a small pan. The blend of flavors are so tasty and the servings are deceivingly large.        Benedicts are among my favorites and  while they are all delicious I can heartily recommend the Pork Belly Bene smoked pork belly, jalapeno hollandaise, english muffin, and house potatoes  or the Country Bene  which is a country fried steak, poached eggs, chipotle gravy, biscuits, arugula and house potatoes seasoned with a perfect spiced gravy.    Very different than the ingredients sound - the Chef has created a wonderful food experience.  A variety of mimosas are available on the weekend - orange, blackberry, prickly pear ,guava  ,  peach,  pineapple,  and cranberry in addition to champagne and a variety of beers.   I've had the pear and blackberry, cold, delicious and refreshing with brunch.   Chefs Antonio and Javier have done a great job with creating a menu with flavor nuances that one wishes to experience repeatedly.   We commend the Kitchen Table to you for  breakfast, lunch or brunch without reservation.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kitchentablelv.com%2F&s=ee68cd89febee7bee05bdcc0965e404f2ab3e1031b9dbd3c7e9415fbe376de6e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kitchentablelv.com</a>",

    "text": "If you can get past the guards and are able to interpret the menu, the quality of the food is outstanding and worth the visit. Just make sure you sit outside, get there 30-45 minutes early, and don't mind being ignored.  I don't appreciate restaurants that don't take reservations. We called the The Kitchen Table about a week before our visit to reserve a table. They don't take reservations, but suggest calling ahead 30 minutes to put your name on a list. We did so for brunch on a Friday, and were told to call back. We called back 10 minutes later and did the same thing, only this time we were allowed to put our names on a list. When we arrived to the restaurant about 20 minutes later, we went to the front counter and said we were here and that our name was on the list. The girl looked at us, said \"okay,\" then walked away. At this point we have had 4 interactions with the staff (3 phone calls, 1 in-person) and one of the workers was helpful. I waited patiently until another staff member approached the counter. I introduced myself again because so far nobody has acknowledged or greeted us. This person said I need to wait until another person could help me out. Finally, the correct person arrived, she was friendly and she sat us a few minutes later. All that to get a table at the restaurant!   We sat outside, as the inside was very noisy and played horrible music (as noted in other reviews). Service was fast but cold, and the food was good and hot  The menu is slightly confusing as they offer \"eggs, buttered toast, house potatoes, bacon or sausage\" and \"2 eggs, toast, house potatoes, bacon or sausage.\" What's the difference? Apparently $2. Also, the menu offers very few substitutions or dietary restricted options, which is disappointing for the quality of the food they serve and crowd they are catering towards.",

The place is super cute and super chill I went with my girl friends and we were catching up. We. Ever felt like they were kicking us out or anything. If anything they continues to serve us until we left. Some restaurants stop serving you after you've paid them. The chef Pedro was super sweet and he came over to our table to thank us for eating there and he told us about their new location. I will back for sure and I will be visiting their new spot as well.  Let's talk about the food!  Super yummy. I got the chorizo omelette and it came with house fries. The house fries were bite size which I love. The omelette was delicious and it tasted so authentic. I orders a coffee and they gave it in a good sized mug. So cute. They serve you chilled water without asking. And refills were never missed. I highly recommend this joint.",

The menu is varied, if oozing with \"trendy.\"  My wife ordered pancakes, which were outstanding, served with an excellent maple.syrup. My daughter had the tacos with egg and avocado and thought they were good.  So, now the reason for only 3 stars. I had the  \"Country Benedict\", which is chicken fried steak, on top of two biscuits, topped with poached eggs and a chipotle, sausage gravy..This dish should be all about the gravy, which is where the dish went downhill: the gravy resembled a chipotle bechamel, rather than a sausage gravy, with the mild spice and smokiness of chipotle. The biscuits were okay, along with the chicken fried steak - nothing to write home about. The potatoes had lost most of their texture.   The server forgot the one coffee that was ordered and never offered refills of the water. We finally flagged down another server for refills.  Also, the woman moving the food to the wait staff area had long hair with no hair restraint worn and rare use and change of gloves without hand washing in between.",

This weekend I had no other plans so I braved the waiting and came to Kitchen Table. Located in the very corner of the strip mall it exists in you just need to follow the signs or the crowd to find the entrance. Seating is available both inside and out so even with a long wait time given, it didn't seem long at all. With so many items to choose from, the first time here can be a difficult one. I want with a benedict with braised pork and was accompanied with a hash on the side. The pork was perfectly cooked both tender and flavorful with a perfectly poached egg and hollandaise on an English muffin. The other item I had was the artichoke crap dip. This dish was very creamy with large chunks of crab, it was almost like a fondue, served with tortilla chips.  I sampled some of my wife's pancakes as well. They were light and fluffy, what put them over the top was the bourbon barrel matured maple syrup. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu items. It may take several trips to get through most of the menu but it will be worth it!",

Two chefs here...one is Mexican inspired and the other does the French side. Both sides are delicious! Chilaqiles are supposed to be the most popular dish on the menu but we went with the French side because we were in the mood for Benedict.  Our Benedict came out ($13-15) and it was super delicious. Easily one of the best Benedicts I've ever had.   Country Benedict came with this huge chicken fried steak with jalapeno gravy on top of biscuits.  Short rib Benedict had this arugula type veggie with English muffins and the softest short rib meat with an awesome Benedict sauce.  Believe me everything was delicious and we ate it all so fast. One Benedict order is huge and could probably feed 1.5-2 people.  I could not reccomend this place more...ambiance was so nice and the smell of the whole roasting pig in the outdoor smoker really fires up your appetite.   Great concept and I'll be coming back!",

I took the servers recommendation for the short rib poached egg breakfast and it was a 10 out of 10. The chef visited our table which was a nice touch. I hope he stays \"hungry\" and stays consistent. We will be back!   2nd time going today. Don't go on Sunday. They are ready to handle that level of business. We waited 50 minute, when we're quoted 30. After being sat at our table, we waited another 15 minutes before I had to ask three times for a waiter. I ordered the same thing as the first time. We got our food after an hour and 40 minutes of being there. It was not as good as the first time. Got there at breakfast, ate at lunch time. Won't be back until they get some more experience   3rd and 4th. No avocado toast on the weekdays. Now Saturday trying to order for pick up to surprise my wife. They don't answer their phone or email. You have good food but figure out the business end",

The restaurant itself is small too. The last time we ate here, we ended up seated six inches from the people at the table next to us. I felt like I was in the woman's lap who was seated next to me.   That said, everything I have eaten here has been delicious. I've had the breakfast burrito and the French toast. They also have specialty items, like monkey bread. There have been a couple of times now when they have been out of something I've asked for. (On my most recent visit, cranberry juice.) Try the espresso or other coffee items though. I've never been disappointed in that regard.",

    "text": "I had this placed bookmarked from reading fellow Yelpers reviews for a couple of weeks. Since  I was having my car serviced out in Henderson on Saturday, I decided to give this place a try. We arrived at about 9:30am and we had a five minute wait from the time we walked in to sitting down. The hostess that greeted us was really friendly and made us feel welcome. I noticed there was outdoor seating but it was not offered. I suppose I should have asked..... Anyway we sat inside towards the back of the restaurant and it was a good location to watch the action and quiet enough to have conversation. They play some good music but at just the right volume.   The menu is full of some fun and different meals. It was a hard choice to pick just one but I ended up ordering Tacos Huevos and Mom had the Eggs in the Basket. She is not too adventurous when it comes to breakfast but her meal was still a good choice. She ordered coffee with her meal and the coffee cups are huge. For those coffee drinkers out there, you won't be disappointed as you can get your caffeine on with these cups! They also offer all kinds of flavored mimosas from your basic orange to guava. I enjoyed the peach which was more like a Bellini but great way to start the morning.   The food arrived and the presentation was nice. There were three tacos with potatoes, eggs, chili's, avocados and crema on top. The salsa on the side had a nice kick and complimented the mini tacos. Three tacos was the right amount to serve as one more would have been too much. The Eggs in the Basket came with wheat toast and the egg was right in the middle of the toast with two strips of bacon on top and a little slaw.   Our service was very good and the decor is a touch of modern and homey. When you first walk in there is a mini bakery with fresh muffins, monkey bread, and other assorted breads for sale. Everyone that works there seems to be very friendly and cool. I accidentally spilled my Moms coffee and it was cleaned up very quickly. Only one draw back, there is only one bathroom which when the place gets busy means you gotta wait so watch how many of those mimosas you drink (Ha! Ha!).   We left about 11:00, and there was a wait at this time with lots of people sitting outside enjoying the beautiful morning. This place is pretty easy to find, you just have to be careful not to pass it when you reach the light at Horizon Ridge Parkway. It is in a strip mall and on the corner.  I definitely plan to return again so I can have the chilaquiles next time!",

That wasn't a bother, we were able to get something to wet our throats while we waited and it was pleasant outside while we did.   The food is really amazing. You can taste the home cooking. My friend who joined me said that she has never had better pancakes anywhere. They were melt-in-your-mouth tasty.   I had the chorizo omelette, and it was melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly portioned, not too spicy and presented beautifully.   The food didn't take very long to come out and the servers were all attentive.   The food itself was well priced.   Will be back, likely very soon.",

Ok so I know that happens here in Vegas and it's hard,  but then well not even 10 minutes go by and yet another cockroach is right next to us climbing the wall. I was just disgusted after this and felt so dirty. I definitely will not be going back.   There are way too many other good restaurants here in town to go to.",

No one ever came back to check on me or ask if I needed or wanted anything else. Food is on the higher priced side for lunch so I was expecting and hoping for a great experience.

Just two of us were grabbing what was supposed to be a quick lunch. The place was half-full, so not busy at all. We were seated at 11:45..orders weren't taken until noon..took a while. Food arrived at 12:25..a salad and eggs Benedict. A whopping 25 minutes. The order of my guest was incorrect..they offered to replace, but who has that kind of time?! The table next to us had incorrect food delivered to their table. A guy there seated by himself left after 20 minutes of waiting for his order to be taken. Food is pricey because there's no place of its kind around the southeast side of town..I get that. However, I think this place is enjoying the fact that there's zero competition anywhere close with an interesting menu and outdoor seating in a great area of town.",

    "text": "I sat outside in the shade with quite a lovely little breeze. The environment is perfect for a brunch date with myself. To start, I had just one peach and creme pancake. The homemade whipped creme is to die for with a little drizzle of the Tahitian vanilla bean & Egyptian chamomile blossom matured maple syrup. THIS WILL NOT DISAPPOINT.  It was a challenge not to eat the whole thing before I dove into the Chilaquiles, which were good. They might have been even better but I'm afraid I slightly spoiled my meal with the decadent pancake . Overall, I have no regrets and want to come back for the breakfast tostada or taquitos and maybe try this foie French toast....  UPDATE: I came back for more. This time I brought my brother and his wife (always better to bring more people for sharing and trying more options). We had the avocado toast, salmon caviar, taquitos, kale salad, and chorizo omelette (not pictured). The toast was BOMB and it comes with a side salad that has a bacon dressing.  The taquitos were pretty good but you should ask for a little more of the green sauce. Kale salad was a perfect compliment with the fig, and the salmon we had for a starter was a good way to get your pallet going. It sounds like the chorizo omelette was okay (I didn't try it and the egg looked a little flat). To be honest, my first visit to Kitchen Table was better. I'm still giving it 5 stars because I enjoy the outside seating.",

Maybe because they were very busy but there was no warm welcome.    I myself ordered the ice tea and Po Boy Crab sandwich which stated came with chips. A \"salad\" with no dressing is not chips.  Paid $15 for lovely looking avacado. Nothing special about my plate. I even had to ask for sweetener half way through my sandwich.   The second plate was the chilequilles. Wich was okay but nothing special either. Overall the experience was nothing worthy of coming back. Overpriced food for 1 hour wait. The Mimosa in a cup and avacado is what we paid $40 for.

At 8 in the morning on a Saturday, we pulled up to find the indoor area packed.  With only few tables available, we were kindly greeted and seated inside right away (more space outside, but it was a bit chilly this morning).  That menu, damn, there is so much good stuff! I wanted to try so much but was only able to try a few today:  Monkey Bread ($5): warm cinnamon glazed bread balls - an appetizer that's more like a tasty doughnutty dessert  Sausage Sampler ($15): three thick sausages with sides of maple dipping sauces  Pork Belly Bene ($15): The pork had a nice crisp and the fresh greens was a nice touch too.  That jalapeno hollandaise was a tad hot for me.  Kitchen Table's menu has everything your breakfast tummy needs: pancakes, omelettes, french toast, benedicts, and really, so much more. What makes it great is that they take all those things and elevate it to a unique meal.   Things I want to try on my next visit: foie french toast, chilaquiles, fruit crepe...",

We had been sitting at the table for over 5 minutes before a waitress asked if we'd been helped yet and said, \"oh well I'll help you then\". We ordered coffee and a few minutes later she came back again and we ordered food. The food came before the coffee and the food wasn't very hot which made me think it sat for awhile before it was brought to the table. I also found the restaurant to be very loud, we were sitting next to 3 adults and 2 kids...we heard their entire conversation and the kids trying to get attention from their parents.   It might be a place I try again when it gets warmer to sit outside.",

    "text": "Look, I'm a fair minded guy.  If the place is jumping and busy, then I don't mind the wait.  However, for a simple order of two pieces of bread, some eggs, potatoes, and pancakes we waited 40 minutes and the place was NOT that busy.  Strike 1.  Strike 2 was offering Vegan toast at all, but bafflingly not removing butter from their pancakes??  Strike 3 was the food being mostly bland and mediocre save for the vegan toast ironically...which we waited 15+ minutes for.  Strike 4, was hilariously the portions and pricing disconnect.  We came in, saw that the portions around the tables and were impressed.  I got the pastrami skillet expecting a decent size for the more expensive item on the menu($16).  I was sadly wrong.. it was tiny!  If I had not replaced my piece of toast with it with 3 pancakes for $4...I would hesitate to call it a meal.  Again, I'm not expecting Black Bear Diner levels of portions here, but something akin to baby stacks maybe.  4 strikes, I take away 3 stars.  You keep a star for decent service.  My friend was considerably more angry than I am.  When food you waited in excess for was not worth the wait by any stretch of the imagination...when even the waiters are baffled by how long it was taking for our rather simple order....when the food costs a bit more than it's frankly worth, that's a recipe for disaster and a recipe for a less than stellar review.  And by the way, the impatient argument is automatically Noneified and voided when there were people behind us that got their food extremely quickly.  We took count, less than half our wait time.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place for breakfast. I'm a huge fan of the trend of breakfast lunch spots that close focus just on those two meals. This spot was good, don't get me wrong, but didn't leave me in awe.  First and foremost the staff and cleanliness of the restaurant was on par. The outside patio seating is very large and seats almost as many as inside. Perfect for a fall day with family.  The interior was interesting. Decor made it feel like it was homey. Long seating on both sides of the restaurant. First thing you notice as soon as you walk in is the fact they have their coffee pots near the host stand. Very interesting location.  We set down and our server introduced himself right away. What are the couple cups of coffee. Coffee is very good. Didn't catch the roaster. It was busy around 11 in the morning and progressed to get busier. The menu is a little overwhelming. About six pages or so. A page for each specialty such as starter/appetizers.  We decided to start off with the empanadas. They're priced at seven dollars and come in a portion of three. Great for vegetarians. We were slightly disappointed though. Not a traditional empanada. It's made with a corn masa like a tamale but it didn't seem fully cooked or maybe it's because it's a different style but it felt doughy in a way. We gave these 2/5  We literally got her appetizer one minute before entrees came out. That was slightly annoying. We noticed that our waiter took the order of three other tables right after he took ours and all the orders went in at one time.  I ordered the chorizo omelette. Again I was a little disappointed. Everything seemed very high-quality. If you're a traditionalist in the sense of a traditional Mexican breakfast, the taste palette is a little different. Not sure if they use a different brand of chorizo or what it is but the flavor was a little off. The omelette was a little lacking in ingredients. I like a \"fatter\" omelette and this one was a little flat. Gave this a 3/5.  My friend Heather popular peaches and cream pancakes. She asked for the peaches and cream on the side. The beaches don't seem to be canned. They came out in a skillet nicely browned in golden. The whip cream is very fresh. Pancakes were also golden brown and fluffy and cooked to perfection. Gave these a solid 5/5.  One thing that we found odd was that the table next to us asked for extra whip cream. A server came out with a plastic container of whipped cream that was obviously used in the kitchen and proceeded to spoon whip cream onto the plates of two customers next to us straight out of the container.I work in the food industry and if the owner or manager of the restaurant I was and saw that they would have a meltdown.  They did get pretty busy. It seemed like they were down to two servers and their female manager. Took a while for us to get any refills on the water or the coffee.  Overall good place. You can definitely see the Mexican and Tex-Mex influences. But this is far from traditional Mexican breakfast style food. Like I said overall good. Maybe a little short staffed and that's what led to the a little less than perfect service but still a decent place.",

    "text": "I've been hearing a lot about kitchen table and decided to try it today (Saturday around 10:30) for a brunch date with the hubs. I called ahead for seating and when we arrived only had to wait 5 minutes at most. We were sat at the long table in between two parties. That is my only negative. I didn't like being squeezed into two groups for a party of two. Besides the seating, the food is amazing.   We started off with the breakfast toquitos to share. They were crispy & full of flavor. The filling is a chorizo potato mixture (like mashed potatoes) and not spicy. But the sauces & slaw has a kick. But the creamy avocado sauce & slaw also provide a refreshing contrast. Would definitely order again. 5/5  I ordered the pork belly benny. The short ribs are cooked in a BBQ sauce & I felt like the pork belly was too saucy, making parts of the English muffin mush. But the taste was delicious with the jalapeno hollandaise. It is served with breakfast potatoes. They are diced in tiny cubes with peppers and onions. I would order again but ask that the pork belly be not so saucy. 4/5  The hubs ordered the chorizo omelette. It was a very generous size filled with lots of chorizo. I didn't have a taste but he said it was very good. Also served with breakfast potatoes.",

Very cute and aesthetically pleasing inside and kitchen gear they served. They have flavored mimosas which I'll be back for. Plates are big so definitely was not disappointed nor worried about leaving still hungry or unsatisfied. I was also impressed with how unique the dishes are put together, not strictly healthy but a more healthy choice if you are hungry.",

I'll play every weekend.  The menu here is extensive, but there is something on it for everyone. Seafood dishes, dishes for the meat obsessed, dishes for the meat haters. It's all there. The entire menu has a Southwestern touch, which as a former Arizonian, I appreciate this greatly. While everything I have had on the menu is great, and I've had a lot. The thing I continue to be most impressed by are their baked goods. The pasties here are unique in favor combinations and so delicious. Oh, and they have amazing Monkey Bread here. You need to get here early though, cause it goes FAST.   The mimosas are amazing. Fairly priced and they don't mess around with the ratio of champagne to juice. 85% champy, 15% juice. Praises! Plus they have a wide variety of flavors so you can switch it up.   As a seasoned bruncher, I ALWAYS want to order a savory meal, but I need to have something sweet on the side. Kitchen table makes this easy, the French Toasts are decadent and easy to share, and the pancakes are massive and probably the best pancakes I've ever had. And just because they can, they make their own syrup here, and it is amazing.   Who knew a place like this could pop up in Green Valley Ranch. I didn't. But I'm so glad it did.",

There are also seats outside.   I ordered breakfast tacos. It came with 3 tacos that had potatoes, scrambled eggs, pico and avocado. It came with a Salsa that was very good. Unfortunately the tacos weren't really anything special. Besides the salsa it really lacked flavor but maybe I should have went on a different direction with my food selection because my friend got the meatless Benedict and she loved it.   We also got the crab avocado dip. That thing is cheeeeeeeesy! It was pretty good. Artichokes would be a perfect fit in that dish if they ever want to change it up. Because the dip is good but if they make that into a Avocado spinach artichoke crab dip...  now that would be a hit!    The staff was great. The cook even came out and checked on everyone in the restaurant one by one. I think his name was Oscar but I could be really wrong. Our waiter was attentive and helpful.   Next time I gotta try the monkey bread I hear it's amazing",

And they sat us all together in the pretty patio.    The food was big, hearty and super tasty!  I ordered the Country Bene... think of an Eggs Benedict... minus the ham and add mini country fried steaks on each English muffin... and it was a gravy-style Hollandaise sauce... OMG.  I was in heaven.  It had a bit of spicy kick to it which complemented the dish well.  I'd definitely order this again if I were in the neighborhood!   I also ordered a guava mimosa and while it was really good... I don't think it was worth the $8 for that little flute of it.  I tried the white sangria and that was delicious too!    If you're in the area, give this place a try... you won't regret it.  Huge menu  with decent prices.  Parking is a breeze since it's in a strip mall.   .",

So far we've the Egyptian\", traditional Eggs Benedict, Croque Madame, and avocado on toast - all very flavorable / delicious! Perfectly poached eggs, amazing grilled baby tomatoes, Grayer'e sauce and dukkah were delicious  Service is excellent, attentive and speedy, and chef came out to see that everyone was happy.  Coming during winter, and sitting outside was perfect. But summer experience looses a star: indoors is too hot, too noisy, bench seats are too low to table.  Apparently there's a Kitchen Table Squared in LV that's bigger and serves dinner - will definitely check that out!!",

    "text": "I had a amazing experience the first time I tried here which I gave a 5-Star review in the past. The service was quick, consistent and accommodating, the manager at the time welcomed us with open arms, staff was very sweet, and the food was amazing.  Fast forward to now and time has changed. This time the service was not consistent at all for the following reasons:  -My friend Booked a table a day in advance for 6 guest, showed up to a unprofessional host or waitress in the front that said she don't have our reservation and to quickly blame a new hostess that's new. Unprofessional to blame your own co worker for that mistake, and to throw her under the bus  infront of your own customers. No accountability whatsoever.  You represent the restaurant so act like it with professionalism. Come Up with a better answer than what you gave us.  -Because they didn't save our reservation, we had to wait outside in 110 degree weather. I had to go in to ask for water because I was dehydrated from the heat.   -Staff don't seemed warm or inviting when you first enter.   -AC seemed like it wasn't working at all. It was very warm/hot and it was 110degrees outside. Don't know how it is appropriate to keep a restaurant open if the Air Conditioner is not working. Can't really give a amazing experience in a hot restaurant. Why even stay open?   -The front of house staff seemed pretty irritated, not very apologetic with the issues going on,  and also flustered. Only one of the waitress was really nice, probably realize what was going on and took care and comped our drinks as a nice gesture to make up for the chaos, and our frustrations. That was very sweet of her.   -It took 10 minutes to finally get some water served, and another 10 minutes fo the waitress to come back to take our order. That's a total time of 20 minutes waiting just to order.   -When ordered a Iced Drink, they placed the order, but comes back to disappoint us that they have no ice. How is that possible to have NO ICE? How can you serve any drinks with no iCE.  -Table setting was incomplete. We had to ask for forks. They seemed irritated. Also when asking for extra plates, they mention they ran out. We pointed out that there's plates sitting there that she could give us. Then she proceeded to give us plates. How can you say you ran out of plates?   Food arriving to our table was the only thing that saved the experience along with the nice waitress that comped our drinks. Food was great. But I honestly didn't think I didn't get what I paid for. They need to retrain their front of house staff, or get a brand new one. I work and also manage  in the service industry and certain behaviors, communication, attitudes, and the level of service would be unacceptable in my eyes.",

Unfortunately I am a spice wuss so with the sauce that was on them my mouth was on fire. I had the croque madam,  and hubs had the chilliquillas. Mine was SO decadent with all the cheese and the amazing sauce. Hubs said his was amazing, but I had to take his word for it because I could SMELL the spiciness lol.

The worst part is lost count over the years the amount of times literally ran past Kitchen Table doing loops from the Multi-Gen for triathlon training. Thankfully my beast partner Suzy H reminded me about this place and one day got together for lunch at Kitchen Table. It was the first time for me. No doubt not my last time.   I got the Monte Cristo. It been long time since had one in general. Talk about bringing back all the best things about a perfect Monte Cristo. The batter was perfect. It was fluffy, golden brown on the outside, and crispy. The inside the cheese was dripping to perfection, the ham tasty, and one of the best Monte Cristo in Vegas. The raspberry jam was top perfect compliment.   Suzy ordered the short rib eggs benedict and french toast. The eggs benedict was amazing. The short rib just alone stood out BIG time. It was braised too perfection. The meat was super moist, with tons of flavor, and had nice little spicy kick in it. I could have had bowl of Short rib braise by itself or pair it with anything else on the menu. Short Rib heaven on earth. The poached eggs were nice not over cooked then top it off with traditional hollandaise sauce. It was truly classic Eggs Benedict just taking another level with the Short Rib braise well well well done.   I enjoy the decor. The big Kitchen Table sign once walk in definitely give the place character. The outdoor patio area is nice on perfect days. You might even see a yelper running laps past you for brunch. LOL.",

But if you wanted to sit outside it was more like 20 minute wait. I'm guessing in the summer that wait time will be reversed.   We decided to get the deviled eggs as a starter. They ended up being not like deviled eggs. The eggs were hard boiled and the mayo was on top instead of all mixed together. It was interesting. Tasty, but not my favorite.   I liked the decor inside. We went for breakfast and I decided to get the pork belly Benedict. They smoke their pork right on site outside which I thought was really cool. I liked this take on a benedict. It was really tasty and the jalapeno hollandaise made it the right amount of spicy. I'd suggest this to anyone that likes eggs benedict and wants to be more adventurous.   I would come here again and try some if their more dessert offerings because that looked good too!",

It's a cute little restaurant and the service is good... I suppose it depends on the day you come. The prices are reasonable. It's great if you live in Henderson, especially at McDonald's ranch. This is a good place if you want good food. In my opinion, if you want fantastic food, this may be the place for you but it most certainly was not for me. This place cannot compete with the amazing places in Las Vegas that I have been to and the great chefs in Las Vegas. I will not likely be returning here because there are way better choices. This restaurant is just OK and this is why it got three stars.",

We came here on a Sunday, was slightly busy but nothing we couldn't handle. I had the Mexican hot chocolate which I love. Disclaimer: the Mexican hot chocolate takes a while to get but worth it. It's not powdered stuff either it's the real deal.  My husband got the chilaquiles, those were really good and the only other chilaquiles I like are my mothers so give them a try. They were super different from my mothers but they had a fun twist and great flavor. I got the pork belly Benedict's, those were fun to eat. They had a jalapeno hollandaise sauce, perfectly poached egg and flavorful pork belly. Do yourself a favor and order those. We will definitely be coming back to try other things on the menu.",

We were seated at the end if a long table next to another family.    Service was great.  Raphael was very nice at helping give us some recommendations.  We ordered the Social Bucket which came with a bottle of sparkling wine and juice.  We also had the Monkey Bread, Chilaquiles, and the Pork Belly Benedict.  Pretty plating and delicious.  Will definitely order the monkey bread and pork belly benedict again.  The chilaquiles was somewhat spicy, great flavor just know it has a kick!   Can't wait to brunch here again and try some new dishes.    The menu had lots if pastries and specialty coffees.  Wouldn't mind grabbing a pastry and coffee in the morning with some good company too .",

They were very busy at 11am on a Sunday, but the wait was only 20 minutes. They have a bar at the entrance so you can enjoy a coffee our alcoholic drink while you wait!   The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent. We ordered the French toast with a side of fruit and the beef short rib benny. The French toast is large thick cuts of French bread and has a nice orange zest flavoring that melts in your mouth! The short rib benny is superb. A large portion of short rib and perfectly poached eggs topped with bernaise sauce! One of the best breakfasts we have experienced in Vegas. We will definitely be back and next time we will try one of there many mimosa flavors!",

You can tell the breading was different and the sauce with the cherry tomatoes was a perfect combination together. Both chefs were even there  to serve us our food.

He is definitely coming back!   The location is a little tricky to see from the parking lot but it's in between a sushi place and a math tutoring place so look for it!  As for the food, everything is made to order and fusion brunch meals which is fun. The head chef is onsite to ensure that everything comes out looking good.  I ordered the vegetarian benedict which sounded amazing on the menu; avocado, fried green tomato, and poached egg. Unfortunately when mine came to the table it was missing avocado but they were very prompt with rectifying the situation so that was good.  We went on a weekday and apparently they don't encourage drinks like their fun variety of mimosas during the weekday because we had to ask for a drink menu. They also feature local beers...yum!  The decor is too cute...loved the furniture and the long family table. They also have a fabulous outdoor area you should check out!",

Don't get me wrong, the food is stellar and the kitchen staff deserves real credit, it is a shame that the front of house is such a cluster so many of the times I have come here.  It is typical to wait, even after checking in on yelp and showing up at the right time. today that wait was almost an hour for a party of 5, even tho we checked in 20 minutes before we arrived. As well, the wait staff has gotten orders wrong at least half the times I have been here. From waiting for attention of a server to forgetting the fact that one of us was vegetarian and putting meat on their plate after we were very specific when ordering, it is hit or miss to whether you end up enjoying the experience of what should be an awesome brunch.  As my grandmother used to say \"GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!\" And maybe you would get the 5 star review your kitchen staff earns.  And staff should not be camping at a table for an hour, while patrons are waiting. Do better.",

The folks next to me had cold food and an incorrect order as well plus they had actually come in for pancakes but were told the batter still wasn't ready 1/2 hour after opening.   Servers were very nice--no complaints there. On a Saturday morning be aware--there were children and babies at almost every table inside and some were running around and playing around the tables on the patio too.

    "text": "I am really surprised by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. Did we eat at the same place? Don't get me wrong, some of the food was good. But I don't think it was $75 good. My friend Rachel and I came in for brunch on Sunday 2/21. You can find this place in a small shopping center where BFE meets Far as hell. (Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde). It was pretty busy, but we only waited about 30 minutes and then we were seated inside at a small table in the back. I would have preferred to have eaten outside because it was such a beautiful day, but luckily our table was all by itself, although it was still a tight squeeze. We were given room temperature water, with no ice, and then some menus. We had a game plan and knew we wanted to try a bunch of things, so we both ordered what we wanted and then split everything. We tried:  Peach and Pineapple mimosas $6 each- I had the peach and thought it was tasty and reasonably priced. I wish they had a bottomless option though, because who doesn't love bottomless mimosas during brunch?   Croque Madame $11- This was very good. This sandwich was made with challah bread, thick ham, gruyere cheese and a sunny side up egg, then the whole thing was covered in bechamel sauce. It was savory, salty and cheesy. It came with a side salad of arugula and tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing which was good  Pb&J pancakes $13- Probably my favorite thing I tried. The pancakes were really sweet although there was minimal pb&j. I added some of their housemade vanilla syrup and yeah I'd like to purchase a bottle of that stuff asap.  Social Pecan Roll $3- We originally wanted the monkey bread but they were out, so we got this instead. It came out warm and had a nice flavor.  Jalapeno Bacon $4- It's bacon and it's jalapeno flavored. What's not to love?  Biscuits $3- The biscuits came out hot and were served with house made jam. These are the poster child of how biscuits should be-flaky, buttery and delicious.  Tostada $8- There are actually 2 tostadas to an order, which was perfect since we were sharing. The tostada had pork, black beans, slaw and a quail egg. There was also some sauce drizzled over the top of the tostada.   Breakfast Taquitos $9- The taquitos also had a slaw on top of them, this one was a lil spicy and had jalapenos but was quite good. I found myself eating the slaw by itself after the taquitos were long gone. The taquito itself was not memorable though.  Rachel also got coffee and a fruit cup for her son, which by the way took forever to arrive. I don't know if they don't have highchairs but we weren't offered one, so maybe think twice about bringing young kiddos. Our total for both meals was $75. Now I am by no means cheap, but this is ridonkulous for brunch. Looking back, I can't believe we spent that much money especially since we only ordered 2 main plates. We did get a military discount and that did knocked the price down $14, but nothing was so amazing that I have to come back and spend that much money again. All in all I think this was my first and last time here. The service was intermittent. Our food took about an hour to come out of the kitchen. They were out of 2 of the items (monkey bread and empanadas) we originally ordered so we had to settle for other things. And it was really warm in the dining room and made our dining experience a bit unpleasant.",

Appetizer so mouth watering. big pieces of avocado and crab(forgot the name)  Main dishes were soooo good. Had a little accident with my food (their fault) but the chef insisted on making me a new one right now. They took it off my bill. Super nice. And he comes and checks everything is okay.  Servers are on top of their job. Refilling and making sure if anything else is needed.  A little on the healthy?  Could work on the hash browns.  Deff worth the 30 min drive and will come back:)",

    "text": "Finally got to check this place out yesterday for lunch. Bustling and busy on a Monday, which was a good sign.  Food was very good but the service not so much.  We were seated and I told the waiter I would just like water and he asked me if I would like lemon with that.  He returned without lemon and then I asked two more times and he never came back with lemon so I let it go. My friend ordered a crab sandwich and I ordered a smoked meat Jersey Joe's sandwich - I believe that is what it was called. The waiter raved about how they smoke their own meats and it was fantastic and blah blah blah.  I also ordered a side of avocado with tomato as my salad. Our food comes out by another server and she brought me the vegetarian sandwich, which I refused. The crab sandwich was correct and so was the side veggies. The waiter came back over and asked me incredulously why I didn't want the vegetarian sandwich and I told him that's not what I ordered. I reminded him how he explained to me how awesome the meat sandwich was. Of course they were busy and it took a while for my correct sandwich to come out. When it did it was delicious but my friend was done with his meal. The manager she came over and apologized, but the server never did and pretty much avoided our table after that. I did not buy the lunch so I don't have the servers name or I would've included it in here. I will probably go back sometime but I will definitely avoid that guy.  I think every customer's pet peeve is for servers that don't write down the freaking orders and then screw it up. Please just use a pad and write it down. We only want our order to be right.",

    "text": "I like this place, and I feel like it offers something Vegas has been missing. Even my visiting parents, while we sat on the patio, said, \"It feels like Scottsdale!\" ...by which they meant the cutesy local restaurants, bars, and shops with nice outdoor space....not the overly tan women with fake boobs and rompers...but we saw those too. The ambiance is really great as the shopping center is at the base of McDonald Highlands, which is nice and green and leafy and tropical. The patio is big and well-secluded from the road and huge parking lot, but still open enough to give you views of those trees. We had no problem getting in with a group of 5, but then we were there on a Thursday at lunch time. Cool menu including empanadas, crepes, pastries, and traditional American breakfast items. My favorite was the egg in the hole (or something like that) which was a piece of toast with the center cut out and an egg cooked over easy inside. Yum! Plus, the beer and mimosa menu is pretty good. Prices are a little higher, as you'd expect, and the service was a little slower than I'd hope, but it could have been an off day. I won't go every day, but I'll definitely be back to Kitchen Table.",

    "text": "Wow. With all the excitement and excellent reviews about this place, I wasn't sure what to expect. When we came it was Saturday and there was a bit of a wait but nothing too crazy. Staff was very friendly and competent.   Their menu is unique, with some Mexican fusion options, flavored mimisas and a variety of homemade bakery goods. I ended up getting biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs which wasn't even on the menu on the weekend but they made it  for me anyway!  Love this chef here! He is super nice and came out to talk to most of the dining room while we were eating.   Our food was nothing short of amazing.  The biscuits tasted homemade, as well as the chipotle gravy. I got it with scrambled eggs and man was I delicious.  I ate the whole plate in about five minutes. I also had a blackberry mimosa to drink which was light and refreshing. My boyfriend had the duck omelette which  was huge, i tried it and the duck was so tender, the cheese gooey, the potatoes seasoned and fresh -clearly another excellent choice here.  Kitchen table is a game changer because it combines an open atmosphere  layout with delicious unique food, 80s music cranking and friendly fast service. I don't give out 5 stars  easily,  but this place blew me away on more ways then one. Keep it  up kitchen table and we will be back with everyone we know!",

The eggs were unimpressive and the sausage was okay. After spending almost $40 I would have definitely expected more.   It was something new, I tried it and probably would not try again.",

Our server Maria was extremely helpful, she went above and beyond to please us. Kitchen table would be 5 stars if they can fix there reservation policy, it's very upsetting to see people walk in first w/o waiting like most of us I had 3 different parties of 2 walk in before us. I was told that they call ahead to be seated which I didn't understand how that works, after the second couple was sat I asked what the deal was? I was informed that my name was pushed back for some weird reason. Putting that aside I will certainly be returning with my friends and family.",

    "text": "Ok let's be honest about this place,I drove all the way to Henderson to try it,I met my friend for brunch at Kitchen Table,I did not see her for a whole month so I wanted to pamper her to a nice place,I've heard about this place from other people and looked on Yelp! And all this great reviews made me want to try it! First off my friend said she wanted to go to Denny's,I suggested this place! Kitchen Table its behind some garbage dumpster,kind of odd.,even though there's a sign that it suppose to lead you to the restaurant it still hard to guess where it is.After driving around we made it! Yayyyy!! Walked in,no one greeted us,they had a 25 min.wait,we didn't wait that long. While waiting I looked around,crowded,loud and small restaurant. I really wanted a cup of coffee while we were waiting so I got up to the counter where the register is at,the girl behind it was talking to a server they both were drinking soda I guess,they both knowledge me,but no one care to ask if I needed help. Their pastries on top of the counter have no cover,so I wonder if it's safe to eat you know! What if someone sneezes?? Hmmm,have health department been there?  At our table.while we were trying to have a conversation it was impossible to listen to each other,seats are weird  and tables are just to long,we had to like lean forward on the table to be able to hear! (Too Loud)  Looked at the stapled menu they have,everything sounded good for two hungry friends,I ordered the country style Benedict,with potatoes and eggs,because I told my friend I wanted to eat like a pig (not thinking I was going to get leftovers)my friend ordered the pork belly one! Food came out quick it smelled good,first bite was interesting I thought I was eating at Denny's,my friend even said your steak looks and taste like it's been in the freezer for months,I laughed! Hers was too greasy. We rushed ourselves out,because we wanted to have a nice conversation.,our server never bothered to ask how was everything! KITCHENTABLE I really wish you the best!",

    "text": "On Saturday afternoon at approximately 1pm, my family and I entered this establishment for our first time. We researched the online menu and knew what we were going to order prior to entering . They told us the wait would be approximately 15 minutes to be seated. We then chose to walk over to the To-Go counter . We asked to see what the doughnut of the day was, since it was advertised online. Both employees, a male and a red headed female were by the pastries when we asked. They both looked at us as if they had no idea what the doughnut of the day even was. They then stated there was no doughnut. We then asked what flavor the green macaroons were and they had no idea. They then looked at the sticky notes and told us the green macaroons were of a butter cream flavor . After being seated, we asked for the waffles, but then were told they don't make waffles anymore.                                              My advice is as follows:                                                   The online menu should correlate with the paper menu at the establishment. Second, all employees should know what the pastry specials are. Especially the doughnut of the day. The two employees we asked shouldn't act too surprised if a customer asks a simple question. We felt as if we were bothering them. When we asked the waitress which pastry specials they had, she said they didn't have specials, they had \"just whatever\". The food we ordered (tacos, avocado toast, and Egyptian dish )were amazing! The jelly was much too sweet for the sweet bread. We give this place a 1 out of 5 due to its customer service. The food is 4.35 out of 5.",

    "text": "The food at Kitchen Table made my experience.   Thursday afternoon at approximately 11am was a bit packed more than i would have anticipated, so plan ahead if you expect to sit immediately. One of the first negatives that i noticed upon approach to the front door to get my name on the list was the very loud music that was playing from a speaker on the patio. And the type of music didnt really \"fit\" the food and atmosphere that was on display here either. I even made a comment to the hostess about not wanting to sit near the very loud music, and she said oh thats just the speaker right there. I was hoping she would catch on and maybe turn it down a bit, but of course it didnt happen. A 20 minute wait found me sitting outside on the steps getting a view of how there was not a lot of thought put into the decor, layout and presentation of the patio. There are enclosed canopies that if i were sitting in would feel kind of weird and stuffy. The long vinyl wrapped high back benches (cheap looking) that look as if they are styled to block the view in and out of the patio area from the passer bys. And the worst part was the hordes of empty food service cardboard boxes that were throw all around the patio, and even into parts of the surrounding landscaping. Does management know this is being done? I cant imagine that anybody can think that this is appealing to the consumer.  Simple suggestions...  If you are going to have music in a restaurant, fit the music and the level to that of the food and experience. I was sitting inside (speaker outside) and i had to speak above normal to be heard.  I think a more inviting patio for both the diners and the passer bys is an open one where people can see whats going on around and not closed in by walls. Passer bys can also see the welcoming patio and venture in to maybe even want to sit and eat themselves. Simple open tables and umbrellas for shade would be ideal under the palm trees you have back there.  And you must get a grasp on those cardboard boxes. There was at least 2 dozen boxes thrown around your patio, and actually made me want to leave, coupled with the music.  But... even with the above, i will still be back. What? Yes! I had the benedict, and it was the best that i have had. The hollandaise was simply delicious and balanced with the most perfect made eggs. If some improvements can be made on the atmosphere, this could be a regular spot no doubt. But till then i will not be rushing back for more.",

They would not take reservations. We wanted to eat outside because that area was empty because it was a little windy but they refused to serve us outside. I asked twice. The noise was terrible with kids screaming, etc. Some of my group left because it took so long and some texted and said they would not show up because they had been looking and just gave up and went home.   Finally we were seated and had an excellent young man for a waiter. The food was good and not the traditional breakfast food. Everything is cooked to order. That is only why I gave it 2 stars.",

When we first arrived we were told by the hostess that there was a 10 min. wait to sit outside which was fine, but they had plenty of tables open which I thought was concerning.  As we were waiting a lady came in after us and was given a table right away. Finally 20 min. later we were seated at our table.  We sat at our table for another 15 minutes before a waiter came over to take our order.  We ordered our food waited another 1/2 hour, and two sets of customers that ordered after us received their food, as we sat there waiting for ours to arrive.  Finally, I asked a bus boy where our waiter was and why our food was taking so long? After another 10 minutes we finally received our food but not together.  Luckily, the food was good, not worth the long wait and poor service.  The management really needs to work on their customer service!",

However this last visit I've had was very unorganized and I haven't experienced unprofessional service like this before. My party of 3 came at 10:25 and was told it would be an hour wait. We decided to wait as we enjoy the the food here and see it as worth it. Throughout the wait multiple parties of 2-4 came in after us and were sat before us.  I normally don't say anything but after the third party being seated before us, I asked the hosts how much longer would the wait be. Both hosts explained they seat parties of 2 before a party of 3 despite time of arrival. That was a strange excuse to as a party of 3 and 4 were sat during our wait time that came after us.  My party continued to wait, and more parties after us were sat. Including 2 parties of 2 and 2 parties of 3. After witnessing this I went in again to ask why have we waited so long when other parties have been seated. They explained they were trying to seat us inside instead of outside, I explained my party stated we have no preference and other parties were told a table was available outside and if that was okay prior to seating. Why was my party not given the offer? Also some of the parties were seated inside, so that excuse didn't make sense. The hosts were unable to explain themselves.  The rest of the meal wasn't able to be enjoyed due to the disorganization of both hosts.",

    "text": "Ok, I've been here twice now and it's definitely a great spot.  However, my first visit was better than the 2nd. I just wasn't as impressed with my food the 2nd time around, although it was still good.  On my 1st trip, I had the Country Benedict and it was EVERYTHING!! I was having trouble deciding whether I wanted eggs bennie or CFS, and this was the perfect compromise because it's BOTH! It was so dang delicious and I still dream about it.  The 2nd visit, I couldn't decide between the pastrami hash or chilaquiles. I went with the hash and I just wasn't impressed. It was a strange dish.....and the pastrami was almost non-existent (although in the picture it looks like there's a lot - this is not True. They were these weird little strips and the dish was just strange). Now I wish I would've tried the chilaquiles instead. Oh well, maybe next time. My friend and I also shared the foie gras french toast, which was AMAZING!! It was really good, and although you might think $22 is a lot of a breakfast dish - FOIE! Pretty hard to beat, and the serving was pretty large.   The guava mimosa I had was really yummy, but I wasn't a fan of the blackberry version (although that was my friend's fave).  This eatery is small and cute and made to be a \"social\" dining experience, with a large communal table highlighting the dining room. The service is great and there is definitely something for everyone on the menu. I just wish they would serve bloody marys - or at least a good michelada (right now they only serve beer/wine).  I 100% will be back and I suggest you go check it out ASAP!! Note that they don't take reservations and it gets very busy - so take your patience and appetite and be prepared to wait!",

We ended up waiting closer to 15-20 minutes.    Once we were seated the server took our order which was a mimosa, a bellini, monkey bread, jalapeno bacon, the traditional eggs Benedict, the pulled pork Benny, and a side of toast with foie gras.  They sadly don't have a bottomless option for mimosas which I always enjoy at a brunch.    Our drinks took a while to come out and it wasn't until after our whole meal came out we were informed that they had been out of monkey bread since 10am.  Wouldn't that have been nice to know when ordering?    While the food was good, my eggs in the eggs Benedict were almost cooked all the way.  They weren't runny as most benedicts are.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the jalapeno bacon but wish it had 4 pieces instead of 3.  My friend wasn't expecting the foie gras to come in the consistency it did.  We are used to having it pureed almost and this was more of something you had to cut, not spread, if that makes sense.  They do have an outdoor patio area where they were cooking a pig and it smelled great.  You can eat out there as well.  Once nice touch was that the chef took the time to come out and see how everything was.  It's always nice to have new restaurants open in the area and I'm glad I tried it however I don't think I would be back based on our experience.",

    "text": "Another new brunch spot in Henderson worth waking up for!   --FOOD-- Their foie gras breakfast selections is what first caught my attention, and honestly left me less enthusiastic for a repeat visit at first. I loved the french toast with foie, don't get me wrong, it just felt too rich for me to have in the AM and slight drain on my wallet as well.  Luckily everything sounded so tempting and one month and 9+ visits later, it's pretty obvious I really dig this place!  Going off by memory  Page 1 - starters & 'small' plates - the tostadas with tender seasoned pork and topped with quail egg, rocks!! My #1 favorite light meal/post workout grub to have here. The empanadas and the sausage sampler (with sausage made in-house) are delicious and great sharing plates.  Specialty - Chicken Fried Steak.,.after seeing and tasting it when I met up wit Teri W., it's on my list order.  Benedict - Pork Belly is my fave, then the Meatless one with fried green tomatoes. Still have yet to try the country one with chipotle gravy.  The lunch section has sandwiches and salads. I guarantee you from peeping at what other diners there had, you cant go wrong pastrami. The short rib sandwich that I shared was pretty good. Although not crazy with the bread that day.  Pastries - I tried them on community soft opening event they had. Pistachio donuts, monster cookie, warm biscuits all delicious, and perfect for a pastry /coffee meetup, but my tummy belongs to the fantastic pastry chefs over at GSS and Ck.    Mexican Hot Chocolate..with those puffy charred marshmallows is my Achilles heel!!  I tell ya, hats off to Chef Antonio and Chef Javier for pulling off such an ambitious and diverse menu, everything is so delicious.  Touching on service.... Everyone always on point for me. It's either Landon or Nicole and why I know their names, is they already made it a point to know all their regulars. 2nd visit in with Nicole, she remembered my previous order from the week before...then again, who orders a table full of food for one.  Same with Chef Antonio and Javier, always has a warm welcome for everyone.   My last visit here, a server passing by, stopped walked back and noticed the water pitcher was empty and offered to have it filled. I thought wow, pretty attentive. So great teamwork on KT crew's part.   Orders are at times a tad slower coming out, but understandably so.  That tiny kitchen can only cook so much orders.  Speaking of space....the dining area is a little more cozy since it's a \"social eatery\" so if you are looking for privacy, this ain't the place for it. Tables are lined up and down on either side.  There's the communal aka the 'cool kids' table too! So don't mind me when butt in and ask what you're having...lol ...  Love the vintage-country-glam going on in their decor with varnished wood tables they did themselves to the warm colors in their stoneware dishes. Love the huge cloth napkins.   There's so much more to say, but I'll save it for a future update after I try the rest of the menu!  FYI:  Since this place is fast becoming a popular spot in our neighbors and local celebs, be prepared to wait for a table during peak brunch hours.  If you are an early bird, no wait time at all. Worth waking up for! Happy to invite family and friends to dine at the Kitchen Table.",

I'm excited for their 2nd location to be opening by Avenue Church.  I'm ready to share this place with my Avenue family.  May God bless you as you open your second location Pedro. Bendiciones",

Either the wait is long, the kitchen is behind , the shades outside are broken so you have to sit in the heat or they've sold out of half their breakfast items. This particular time it was the kitchen. Came for breakfast on a Sunday and fully expected the wait. They don't have reservations or call ahead so fine. . It's brunch so what do you expect. Me and the other person in my party wait thirty minutes for a table to get seated. We start our order with the waitress and then ONLY THEN are we told the kitchen is behind and it'll be about another 45 mins for food. I don't know about anyone else but I don't have that much patience and if they were that behind that should be relayed to people prior to waiting . This place has a lot of hype and the food is decent however they haven't figured out how to keep up with business. My suggestion would be to skip the hassle here and go down the street to craft kitchen",

    "text": "The food actually is unique and the atmosphere much better than the surrounding breakfast/brunch options. The thing is, the lack of organization and slow service makes it hard to enjoy the great things about this place. The wait can be over 30 minutes and the seating order is haphazard, so larger parties that come after you can end up being seated first. The dining area is also more crowded than comfortable, making it hard to find any privacy.  If the above doesn't matter much to you,  I'd recommend the empanada appetizers. The avocado toast had a wonderful flavor but the toast wasn't toasted - just avocado on bread. I'm hoping they can be a little more organized and really make this place shine.",

We had the crab and cheese dip, egg and bacon shooters, country bene, pork belly bend and crab po boys.   Disappointed that even tho we came about 12 o'clock they were out of pastries and monkey bread, which people keep talking about!   Bomb pop was really good! It wasn't on the menu but I saw someone drinking it so had to ask our waiter.   Over all we enjoyed ourselves, the food was amazing and it's a little local spot that will definitely come back too.",

    "text": "Wow, they're growing like weeds. But in a good way.  Kitchen Table is the latest breakfast and lunch restaurant launched by folks with high-end restaurant experience. In this case, Chefs Antonio Nunez (Circo, Le Cirque, etc.) and Javier Chavez (Mercadito and Whist, presumably alongside Antonio) are bringing their \"social eatery\" concept to life in a quiet Henderson plaza otherwise notable for neighboring restaurant Shabu Shabu Paradise.  The menu has a seemingly endless array of from-scratch food and baked goods. They've actually trimmed it a bit based on customer feedback and orders, but it was still not easy to select dishes.  Chocolate croissant ($3): a mostly excellent start. Crispy golden brown exterior, fluffy interior, and... wait, why is the chocolate filling offset on one side and not straight down the middle? You can completely whiff on the delicious sweetness if you divide it length-wise, and it was inconvenient to eat because width-wise cuts were still too long to be an easy bite.  Empanadas ($6, 3 pc): filled with cheese and veggies, topped with a salsa and crema, and served on a bet of greens and black beans, these are likely among the better appetizers. It's yummy, and the heat wakes up your palate. The empanadas themselves are miniature, but it's a complete dish.  Tostadas ($6, 2 pc): this fell flat. The ample portion of suckling pork was appreciated, as was the fresh slaw, but there weren't any flavor pops as in the empanadas. Give me any sort of spice or sweetness and that instantly improves. Also, I'm not sure whether the texture decayed in the few minutes' delay, but the tortilla did not have much crunch. Even the crunch wouldn't have saved this dish.  Crispy French Toast ($11): maybe my fault partially for listening to the server's recommendation, but this was also quite a letdown. I expected a lot more crispy texture, but the toast was pretty soggy in the middle. Even the granola was somehow soft. The flavors were not in the sweet zone that I would have liked, but I could have excused that if it'd lived up to its name.  Croque Madame ($11): thank goodness for this. Definitely needed a salty ham sandwich to liven up my morning, and although the gruyere wasn't melted, it was also delicious. Loved the generous helping of bechamel and the sunny-side up egg with runny yolk too, and the salad with sundried tomatoes provided a welcome fresh and light contrasting element.  Shorty Bene ($15): I've noticed a pattern of short rib tasting like it's lacking salt, and it held True today. But this wasn't bland by any means, and it was super tender. With a perfectly poached egg, a bearnaise and red wine reduction sauce, and a salty crispy hash that makes up for any seasoning voids, this is rightfully one of the most popular dishes here.  Although I opted to stop and box up leftovers at this point, I noticed that more friends had filed in for breakfast. When I joined them for conversation, they insisted that I join them for food, and who am I to resist more of the menu that was starting to impress me?  Smoked Salmon and Caviar ($14, 3 pc): an appetizer-worthy dish that's hidden near the back of the menu. Delicious lox and caviar with quail eggs, dill oil, micro green, and crema atop blinis. It's pricey even as far as this menu goes, but it's worth a try.  Foie Gras French Toast ($21): the must-try french toast dish that I'd hoped to find earlier. Sweet but not soggy amaretto batter toast, seared yet tender foie that's the tastiest pure foie I've tried so far, caramelized pears, and candied nuts may well be the best bite in the entire menu.  Monte Cristo ($9): this egg-less cousin of the Croque Madame has a nice crunchy exterior and is drizzled with a lovely sour-sweet strawberry jam (more jam available upon request), but there isn't as much ham. And as gooey as the Muenster was, it's not as assertive in flavor as the Gruyere. Admittedly, I was very full by this point, but I'd be hard-pressed to choose this instead of the Croque Madame.  Chopped Salad ($7): a lettuce mix with cucumbers, corn, cheeses, other goodies, and vinaigrette. Fresh, tasty, and relatively light. Probably best if presented/eaten at the start rather than the end of the meal.  Service was fair, not quite as inattentive as the other new brunch spot. Granted Chef Antonio himself was working the room today, greeting and engaging with customers, bringing out and explaining dishes, and otherwise pitching in. The kitchen seemed to be slow and took 10-15 minutes each time to send out food.  A few more nitpicks: really crowded space, with a narrow aisle in the dining area. for employees and patrons alike. Also, I think that the pop/pop covers music was a little high in volume. I could've done without the communal long table that's probably meant to encourage conversation, but it wasn't uncomfortable.  I'm not sure yet whether it's the best new brunch restaurant in Henderson, but I'll surely return soon to Kitchen Table to try more food.",

I ordered a Mexican Hot Chocolate and Chicken Fried Steak plate.  We also started with a chocolate crossaint.    The duck philly was ok... I had to try hard to taste the duck, though hubby said he could taste the duck.  I think the ooey gooey cheese overpowered the duck a bit for me.  It was accompanied with a side of the most flavorful potatoes I have eaten.    My chicken fried steak was smothered with a chipotle gravy but still maintained its crispiness.  I chose well scrambled eggs to pair with this steak, and it was also accompanied by the delicious potatoes.  If I had eaten protein earlier, I would have ordered so many more pastries item.  Everything on the pastry counter looked so yummy.  Hubby and I have plans to stop by again on Saturday for breakfast.  He has his mind on the French toast foie gras, and me...well, all the pastries I am able to consume!   I have to wait until my baby is born before I try the croque madame, since the previous reviews raved of this item.  For next time, I will try the monte cristo.  Chef Nunez was the expediter and also found time to greet us and everyone else in the dining area.  We do love the decor and vibe of this eatery, and am glad that it is in our neighborhood.",

They had a wait with open tables, because they weren't staffed up early enough, servers were coming in the front door while people were waiting for a table.

Mom was a bit hesitant when we walked in and saw that the place is pretty small, and there is some communal seating (a large single rectangular table along the right side).  But we were hungry so she relented.  We sat in the middle of the large table with people on either side of us, which was a little annoying.  Hopefully you won't have loud or irritating table mates if you go.  Or request a separate table but you may have to wait a while.   As for the food...Delicious!!  Eclectic menu but nothing too odd.  Mom had salmon Benedict which she loved.  Excellent smoked salmon.  I had chorizo omelette which was delicious. Dad had a ham crepe and sis had breakfast tacos.  Everybody loved their food.  Fresh tasting ingredients, perfectly cooked.  Go for the 5 star food.  Just knocked 1 star off for the seating.  But a great little place for Henderson.",

My other half had the chicken fried steak with chorizo, house potatoes eggs and hollandaise.  Normally chicken fried steak is tough but this was tender and tasty.  I had a pastrami hash with house potatoes and two basted eggs on top.  It was absolutely fantastic and had many flavor profiles.  I may go back to eat here today.

    "text": "This place is clearly run by serious chefs.  The food is a much more creative version of breakfast & lunch diner food, made to order with quality ingredients.  One mark of a superior breakfast/brunch place is eggs benedict done correctly, with eggs cooked through but yolk runny when it gets to your table.  This place does them right.  My one caveat is that the service is ssslllooowww and they were out of a couple of key menu items (e.g. orange juice) when we went.  Otherwise this is worth a trip from the Vegas Strip for breakfast that is very good and will not empty your wallet.",

    "text": "Wait for a table long. There were a couple of empty tables when she took my name but I'm sure there was a reason. So I went in to order mimosas to help take the edge off from my hunger. I stood at the counter for several minutes without any acknowledgment. There were a few people back there so I wasn't completely sure who to ask for my order. I finally just interupted the gentleman who stepped to the register asking who could take my order. He said he would. I waited another few minutes to recieve my mimosa. Granted, they were busy. After about an hour (and 2 mimosas later), we were seated. After all that, the service (Landon) was excellent and the food tasty. The Mr had the Pork Green Chile and I ordered the Foie Mac Muffin. We started with the Bacon & Egg Shooters and Breakfast Taquitos. The chile was fantastic and shooters were yummy if you don't mind a creamy deviled egg. The muffin was good too but probably try something else next time. The Taquitos were not our favorite. Overall, I would probably go back to try something else at an earlier or later time to avoid that long wait.",

With a newborn, we thought to eat outside. We did not last long and they let us move inside without making it seem inconvenient, even though, as an ex-food server, it bumped the servers around.  Thank you for everyone making us feel welcomed",

I had the breakfast burrito it was super yummy! I didn't like the side of greens but The marble rye was AMAZING!  Everyone must try the marble rye. Sadly the fritata (spelling) was way over priced for what it was.",
