The layout is weird...the food sounded good on the menu...although more of the same:  do we really need anymore devilled eggs and tempura green beans? All the food was okay...but just okay.  My pulled pork baguette was kind of a modified banh mi, but really lacked flavor and textural elements. My friends had similar reactions to their lunch. I'm thrilled to see downtown do well, but I have to give SP a \"meh.\"",

Make sure you load up the chutney for the full sweet and savory experience. Next we had the crispy deviled eggs and seared tuna sashimi with alvacado. The fish was fresh and delicate and the eggs were a twist on deviled eggs I have never seen before. The sliced cornichon's added the perfect dill compliment. We had the Yorkshire popovers, light and rich with an awesome onion gravy...amazing. Finally we finished off with the desset cheese plate with derby sage, double creme brie, a stilton blue, and a chevre. All were served with a homemade fig jam and crusty baguette. The chef came out and offered us sticky pudding and we chatted about the menu and some of the offerings we should come back and try (the butcher's board). Everything was wonderful, a great experience in an exciting and changing neighborhood. I look forward of all the great things to come for this quaint pub with a marvelous menu. The service was top notch and the biggest asset this pub has is the obvious passion the staff has for food and service that can be seen in all that they do.",

Last I had the fish and chips and my girlfriend  had bangers and mash. Best meal in our 3 days in Las Vegas. So so so glad we didn't  go to a buffet.

Yelpers helped us decide to give The Smashed Pig a try. SO glad we did!!  We went on a Friday night around 730p. We were seated right away and our server, Lilly, was super nice. There were So many things on the menu that sounded interesting. We had a hard time deciding. Ultimately, we landed on the Popovers, the Fried Deviled Eggs, and the Bangers & Mash. Every single thing was fresh, piping hot, and delicious. With a wine and ice tea, the bill was $46 before tip.  The food is simple and yet innovative. The restaurant is small, and doesn't look like much from the street, but it is well worth a trip to check them out for dinner. We've already picked out what we want to try next time. I can see me becoming a regular here.",

    "text": "Sometimes, you don't need a picture to support a review of a business that's really good. Or at least that's my story after another phone battery outage during a restaurant visit...  (Sorry about that. I did get some photos courtesy of a friend who finally made time for lunch during a return visit to Vegas, I was originally going to introduce him to a certain new sushi burrito place but our mutual local buddy said that we should try this new place downtown called The Smashed Pig. I can be a bit of a sucker for brand-new places these days, so I agreed.)  (Oh, and that sushi note? Interestingly, Nobu Matsuhisa-trained chefs Linda Rodriguez and Martin Swift formerly ran a Red Rock Resort restaurant called Hachi, no relation to the new Hachi on Jones near Spring Mountain. That explains some of the Japanese influence in a simple one-page food menu otherwise easily mistaken for that of a British pub.)  This self-proclaimed gastropub opened a couple weeks ago in a former tattoo parlor, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Las Vegas Blvd. Interestingly, they're only open 2-11pm on the weekends right now. As I recall, the bartender/server mentioned that morning traffic has been slow on the weekends in this cold season. That all said, we were fortunate to arrive after opening, and we seated ourselves at the bar after being told that the restaurant section would be unavailable until the server's scheduled start time at around 4.  I could go on and on about the comfortable atmosphere and the bartender's menu knowledge and friendliness, but let's get to the food already.  French Bean Tempura ($7): wholly ordered off the bartender's recommendation. She called it \"crack,\" and I can't disagree. It's pretty straightforward tempura with chipotle mayo and toasted almond slivers, but I could hardly stop eating it. I'd get it next time in a heartbeat.  Lamb \"Tacos\" ($9): not the most beautiful colors ever seen in a dish, but a nice spice profile somewhere in the vicinity of the Middle East or India, some serviceable sour cream, an sweet pepper chutney that's addictive on its own, and a crispy eggplant that substitutes for a hard shell. Overall, another fantastic appetizer. I considered ordering a second helping, but I wanted to try other items instead.  Crispy Deviled Eggs ($8): served with cornichons (tart, mildly sweet pickle) and dusted w/ paprika. Lacked the oomph of the other two appetizers, especially in the hard boiled white. It's good, but not exceptional.  (I skipped the $3-a-piece oysters based on the bartender's description of their small/medium size,  verified by my observation, and they weren't particularly impressive per my friend.)  The Smashed Pig Burger ($14): seems like all beef to me, ironically. Ordered medium and without cheddar (+$1) per my visiting friend. It's served with sea salt garlic fries, which may be a tad underseasoned and not so potent in garlic but are otherwise perfectly textured (you know, the whole crispy/fluffy thing) and go well with either ketchup or the burger sauce (a mixture of ketchup, mayo, sriracha, and a sauce whose name escaped the 'tender but may be the \"HP\" brown sauce). This sauce really helps out the burger too, which is not great until the sauce is added.  Fish and Chips ($16): two large cod fillets with tartar, hot mushy peas (not joking, almost burned my fingers), and malt vinegar. I have had much less experience with fish and chips than I'd like, but even if this dish isn't done the proper way, it's done the right way. You can't go wrong with really moist fish inside a crispy batter, and all the condiments work, including the very palatable peas. Oh, and the same fries from earlier serve as the chips here. Maybe a little pricey, but I was happy enough even if my wallet wasn't.  Sticky Toffee Pudding ($5): this was somehow at least as wonderful as the toffee pudding that I recently tried at the now-closed David Clawson Restaurant. This moist, delicious cake topped with whipped cream and a caramel sauce that's less viscous that anticipated is, dare I suggest it, destination-worthy. It was certainly a worthy end to a marvelous meal  While the gastropub experience might be considered incomplete without particular beverages, I abstained from alcohol due to DD duties. I will note that my friends seemed to enjoy the canned craft beers, such as the Back Home gingerbread stout. Maybe I'll try it next time, or I could pick a beer pairing specific to each menu item.  With a disclaimer that I haven't visited nearly all of the other Downtown Las Vegas restaurants, I currently can't recommend another nearby restaurant over The Smashed Pig. I'd say that Carson Kitchen (NOTE: based on an old visit) isn't as good, and Park on Fremont across the street should just shut down now and save themselves the agonizing death. Whether you want a full meal or a quick bite, you should definitely stop here the next time you're in DTLV. Better yet, make this the focal point of your visit.",

    "text": "The husband (!! - that's new!!) headed to Las Vegas for a few days for a minimoon - our last night, we headed downtown for Carson Kitchen after hearing LOTS of top notch recommendations and reviews.  We called to ask for their normal seating wait.  We went, SUPER excited.    Then, we got there, and it was closed.  For a private event.  Something they did not mention when we CALLED.  Oh well.  Off we went in search of another spot.  We turned the corner, were given a 60 min wait estimate at another place, and then I saw THIS beauty.  It sounded fun, the reviews looked good, and we. were.  HUNGRY.    The Smashed Pig did not disappoint.  We each ordered a crafted cocktail - odd for us beer drinkers - and loved them.  Strong, did the trick!  The menu was SO hard to choose from, lots of great options.  We ended up going with the butcher block of the day, feeds 2.  We got the last one, so that indicated a good choice.  It arrived, and it was LOVELY.  The new Mr. said it was \"the best pork he had ever eaten, perfect outer seasoning and cook temp.\"  After dusting off my hurt feelings (lol, not really), I agreed.  The gravy with it was incredible, and the salad  had enough variety to make it worth eating, and a compliment to the board, not an after thought.  We will recommend this place to everyone who goes to Vegas, and we will go there if (when?) we return to town!",

We sat next to the kitchen which was cool so, we can watch the magic in the kitchen...we ended up smelling like oil and food after dinner but it's alright. Their dinner menu is small. A few appetizers, burgers, garlic fries, mashed potatoes, fish and chips, trifle, sticky toffee pudding, butcher's block for 2, and a few other items. Their drink menu is much longer. They feature special items for lunch.  Yorkshire Pudding: Warm balls of light and airy bread drizzled with sticky sweetness. The gravy you dip them in is wonderful. 5/5  Crispy Deviled Eggs: I've been having deviled egg cravings a lot lately and I'm not even a fan of egg yolks. This version has the usual paprika but with crispy bits and cornichons. Creamy egg yolk, soft egg white and crispy bread crumbs. 4/5  Fish and Chips: Two decently-sized fish that have been lightly breaded and fried until golden. The chips that they came with were crispy and flavorful. I asked our server to substitute my chips with garlic fries but I think she forgot - I'm glad she did though because it might've been too much goodness for me to handle.  Sticky Toffee Pudding: Warm pudding with toffee sauce and cream on top. The portion is not ginormously humungo - it's good for two people. It's sweet but what sticky toffee pudding isn't?  The service was very friendly. From the server, bartender, and the chef. They were playing songs by Brits: The Beatles, Everything But the Girl,  Adele, Rollin Stones...I didn't stick around long enough for Spice Girls. I'm happy that there's a proper British pub in town that isn't on the Strip.",

    "text": "Since my brother is in town he wanted to try something I haven't tried before so I decided to try Park on Fremont.  We sat outside and reviewed the menu and neither of us were really thrilled but decided we could swing it.  I was pointing out some of the newer places when I saw The Smashed Pig and said \"When did that open?\"  Since no one had acknowledged us at Park yet we got up and crossed the street to check out the menu.  The front bar guy sold us on the two person beef hanger steak butcher block and told us they had opened two days ago. So we came on in to give it a try.  That was an excellent choice.  We started out with the lamb tacos which had nicely spiced and tender lamb in a crispy fried eggplant shell topped with sweet pepper chutney.  Then our main arrived and it was glorious.  The beef was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was superb. The Sakai sauce that came with it was a perfect accompaniment to that and the greens.  The mashed potatoes had to have had at least a stick of butter in them; that was a very good thing.  And the simple field green salad that accompanied it had a ginger dressing my brother loved.  It was quite simply one of the best meals I have had in Vegas.  We also had the sticky toffee pudding which was good, but couldn't live up the main course.  I also ordered their Tow Rag cocktail which was quite refreshing and not very sweet at all.  My brother tried the Tenya Creek Hefeweizen which was so good we both got another.  Brandon was our server and he was informative and attentive.  Martin, the owner, even stopped by the table to make sure everything was fine.  I will most definitely be stopping back in to give lunch a try one Friday.",

I sat at the bar and the bartender (Paul) was awesome with the drinks he made and the  conversation he held. All of the cooks were great at what they do and produced some of the best tasting food that I've had downtown. I would recommend this to everyone I know and new people that I meet",

I can't recall the other drink I had but it was a treat. the bartender asked me what I like and whipped something wonderful up from there. dad enjoyed their beer selection too.",

Brandon even suggested he can serve it family style although we ended up not sharing because we loved our individual orders! Lol! My mom let me tried the fish and chips and it was so good because you can actually taste the fish and not the batter. I had to steal some from her. A must try is the butcher's block, the house made sausage, the steak frite and the roasted salmon.In the end, we finished them all. Go to fremont and try The Smashed Pig!",

We ordered the crispy deviled eggs, fish and chips and the pork schnitzel. Eggs were good but the oil in which they were fried was old and gave a bit of an off putting flavor. The fish and chips was a decent sized order but waaaaay too greasy. And the schnitzel was bland and a tad tough. I will write it off to it being a Monday and just not their best performance. As a frequent tourist this is one of the issues I have with restaurants that are not consistent.  I know they can rock certain items and take a great deal of pride in the product they area putting forth. But for the tourist who visits so infrequently, it's hard to return when the first impression was so blah and there are so many other options.",

The deep fried texture provided a nice crunch without taking away from the egg texture itself.   The filling  \"topped off\" the appetizer perfectly.   The food, atmosphere and service made this quick visit a memorable one.   I will make sure to stop by again for a full meal experience.",

Every single item was unbelievably delicious, we loved the casual, friendly atmosphere, and the bill was more than reasonable. Truly outstanding.",

Some of the dishes we ordered are Yorkshire Pop-overs, Spicy Crispy shrimp, Pop, and Housemade Banger and mash. They were all delicious.  Most of the dining is in the rear of the establishment and when the place was getting busy, it was very noisy to my liking.  The waitress was attentive.

The fish and chips were pretty good as well. The fish tasted fresh and the batter was great; not too heavy. The chips were good too. It came with ketchup, good tartar sauce and a lemon wedge. And instead of mushy peas, it came with a mushy pea fritter which ive never tried before. It was really good! I couldve eaten 10 of those instead of the chips!  Im going to go back there more and more so i can try more of their dishes! If youre looking for a nice place for great food and a grear drink menu, you gotta come here!",

After you order from the bartender you just walk in the back to get seated.  All the food here is really good, everyone was satisfied with their food. I would love to come back to try their dinner menu though because there's a lot more options. The only part going to this restaurant is you have to park in the meter parking which cost you some money. Overall, the ambient, service, and food were all great! If you're in downtime, it's a must try restaurant",

After a long day of seminars, debates, and lectures one needs to eat! Carson Kitchen, which I love, was characteristically busy. This time it proved too much. Now I have many times stumbled across The Smashed Pig during my Fremont adventures in a less than coherent state but never have I gone in. THAT WAS A MISTAKE! CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!   Walking into this little gem I knew I found a good spot. Fair notice that management recently changed and that the menu has been altered.   Food suggestions:  I don't see it on some of the menus I saw on here but THE LAMB CHOPS! oh dear god, the lamb chops. They were fantastic. Just cooked perfectly. Even my friend Christian, who isn't a fan of lamb, found them delectable.   But the best thing we had was the Steak Frites. Cooked to perfection with French Fries to die for. The good thing is that little fantastic feeling when you cut into the steak and your request for rare is actually rare. Very pleased with The Smashed Pig. I will certainly be back.",

Good combination of pork and beef, cooked right. I wanted to like this place, as I'm the one who chose it. $10 tiny margaritas with 3 oz. of mix and 3 oz. of ice was... disappointing.

It is a small more modern space and kitchen, but that's part of why we liked it! There was unfortunately only one waitress working this busy night when every table was full, but she couldn't have pulled it off better. The food was deeeeLISH. The appetizer shown above was an absolute MUST have- the mini stuffed Yukon's and Yorkshire pudding. Wow. Brings back mouth watering memories just typing that. My grandma had the steak which was truly cooked to perfection. The fish & chips, jumbo pretzel, and bangers & mash were all wonderful. The only thing I'd recommend potentially put skipping on would be the burger! Other than that, this place is amazing. I'd recommend making a reservation as well because this place is hit or miss- can fill up pretty fast on a short notice if you risk it!",

It's a cozy little place that goes back farther than you would think. Service was very friendly and helpful. We LOVED the fried deviled eggs and the mac & cheese (more pasta heavy, and less cheese but we enjoyed it all the same!)  Meh things: service was a bit slow. We weren't in a rush so it didn't bother us much, but there were moments that we felt like we were waiting for a while. The wine glasses were super tiny, and therefore the pours were light. The steak and frites were alright. We enjoyed them, but nothing to write home about. We were particularly excited to try the Yorkshire pudding and gravy, but we're sadly disappointed. The gravy was bomb, but the puddings were over-cooked and some slightly burnt. Might have been an off night. We got a side of vegetables and it seemed a bit steep, price-wise considering it was mainly sliced onions. Good flavor though.  Overall, it seemed like they may have been off their game that night. Would recommend people to try the place given that they have a lot of cool menu items we didn't get to try. We will probably give it another shot.",

Service and food both great. We started with the deviled eggs and tempura green beans since everyone yelped about them. Green beans had nice batter with a mix of a spicy chipotle sauce and a drizzle of teriyaki , yummy! The deviled eggs were exact as described with a nice slice of a mini pickle atop. For our main course we had Fish and chips and the lamb tacos. The batter was perfect on the fish and the thick cut fries were perfectly crisp on the outside. The lamb tacos were delicious. Looked like pulled pork but lamb. Had a definite \"lamby\" taste but in a good way. Loved it. Nice walk around Freemont street after dinner.",

After that, service was strange, our order was taken twice by the busser and then by the waitress. Nobody visited our table after we got our order and then our food. I got the steak and eggs, $24 plate since most of their menu wasn't available. It was good. My girlfriend ordered the hash, which was 95% pork fat.  This place just seems like every employee does everything instead of having a specific job. Very confusing. Second time we came was even weirder. The guy made me order then pay first, then said to wait to be seated. The bartender was like oh just sit wherever you want, and we did. She then brought us water. I'm currently sitting here wondering if the bartender is also playing server tonight.",

A few of us ordered drinks, including the Crown Jewel and Downtown Pimm's. Terribly sweet because of the flavored syrup and other liquers. No finesse whatsoever. Enjoy the hangover and a film of sugar coating your mouth.  We also ordered some food to share:  - Crispy Deviled Eggs were an interesting texture and weren't too bad, but they weren't anything fantastic either.  - Chicken Lettuce Wraps were sad. Instead of wasting your money on three little pre-filled wraps, go to an Asian restaurant specifically.  - Tartare was delicious, but it was a tiny serving that was mostly unshareable.  - Sea Salt Garlic Fries served with ketchup tasted very little of garlic oil. Most lackluster garlic fries I've ever eaten.  - Shepherd's Pie was plain. That's all I've got.  - Cheese & Cold Cut Platter was okay because it didn't require any cooking. You can't mess that up. There was a smoked cheese that was quite good.  Overall, cheaper prices in comparison to the rest of Vegas. So maybe we got what we paid for?",

A lot of the spots near Fremont are pretty pretentious and overpriced. Granted, I understand hiking it up a bit for the tourist market. I don't mind paying a little extra as long as the environment is good, the food is good, and the service is good. When you first walk into The Smashed Pig, it seems impossibly small. Then you're escorted passed the bar through a little passageway where the rest of the dining section opens up with the kitchen on display. The place is still not big, but doesn't feel claustrophobic. The food is homey but still creative. The drink menu is very tasty, and honestly not too pricey for Strip prices. I like that this place doesn't FEEL like it's in downtown. For a moment while you're eating and drinking your brew, it feels like a tiny respite from the business of the Fremont area. I liked it a lot, and from what I could tell, the chef was legit from England. We had the Lamb \"tacos\", the Bangers and Mash (oh my godddd so good), and the Sticky Toffee Pudding (my favorite thing about the British is not everything has to be chocolate flavored. Seriously, I freaking hate chocolate cake and American eateries are like 90% brownie/chocolate cake/cookie dough). Very good, glad we had the opportunity to try it out!!",

    "text": "Firstly I'd like to start off with the fact that the food we ordered was really good. Sashimi Garlic Fries Mac & Cheese Deep Fried Deviled Eggs Sticky Toffee Pudding All of it was good except for the mac & cheese which was oily opposed to creamy. This needs some tweaking. Sashimi tasted good but was warm from sitting in window too long. Cocktail was very weak and my husband is not a heavy drinker and thought it was just okay. My reasoning for the 3 stars is because of the service! Service gets 2 stars and that is really stretching it!. Gregory was our server & he acted like he would like to be anywhere but the Smashed Pig. Not very friendly at all. The most frustrating part was seeing our food in the window forever waiting and waiting for him to pick it up! It wasn't just our food either! Then there was this older man with an accent working in the kitchen that kept YELLING yes YELLING from the kitchen that the food was up. Gregory was M.I.A. and it was very frustrating. So when he finally brought our food I said hey, our food was in the window for awhile. He just gave me a blank stare, dropped the food off and never said a word. We were on vacation so we just chilled even though we were annoyed. He did stop by once and then I asked for a dessert menu. Never asked if we wanted more drinks or if we needed anything. This was the most disappointing part of the meal as this place is cozy, love the music and we were in good moods! He kind of ruined it for us. I left a decent tip but I usually leave WAY more. We go to Vegas a lot and not sure if we will go back to this place again. There is so much competition in the area and after the stellar service at Le Thai, Bocho just to name a couple of the restaurants where they gave us good service it is hard to get past a server with an attitude. And the yelling from the kitchen!!! STOP! Maybe get a better server that you don't have to yell at! We were of course seated right next to the kitchen! Lol...I protested and the girl from the bar said well it won't be so bad! Really?? Very disappointed in the Smashed Pig. After all it is the entire experience that matters. Should of taken the clue when she wouldn't allow us to sit somewhere else. Red flag out the gate. This place \"could\" be great.",

The food and atmosphere was excellent. Just think they need the windows wrapped with advertising as you see many places do. The neon sign wasnt on yet so it was a little hard to see the name.  I ordered the bangers and mashed, the gf fried fish, and several burgers were ordered.  Everyone loved the food. Especially the fish. ONLY complaint was the extra juicy burgers do not fair well on the cutting board plates. It dripped on one of our guests as it was served. Maybe get one with a cut ridge to prevent that  We loved the industrial look. Great design and Vegas pics.  See you next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "Came to The Smashed Pig for lunch, and there were some pros and cons. As for pros, the Grilled Salmon Sandwich is really good. Juicy salmon with a soft bun. Surprisingly the sandwich doesn't get too soggy, but that's probably because I ate it so quickly. The ordering method is pretty awkward: you order 1st at the bar and then you're seated. Ambience is fine for lunch hours and there are a number of skylights. Music selection included a lot of 80s hits. The waitress was a little abrasive and seemed a little curt, but offered no real problems.   *Be advised they do not serve ranch here*  This would totally be a 4-star review if they served ranch.",

Ordered the Butcher Block which was Slow Cooked Beef Shortribs w/ Marsala mushroom sauce, roasted pasilla mashed potatoes, roasted garlic bread and salad.   These beef short ribs are some of the best I've had. I would place them in my top 5, maybe even top 2 I've had. The meat was so tender it slid off the bone. The flavor was amazing and I almost placed an order for a second helping.  I would highly recommend this place. Good prices, great staff, amazing food.",

    "text": "In case you are unfamiliar with the term \"gastropub\", it is defined as: \"A self-indulgent hipster restaurant bathing in its own smugness\". The Smashed Pig is pretty much exactly that definition. Nestled in a small section of Fremont Street East, this minimalist bar/restaurant plays itself off as a British pub. It tries...it really does, but overall, it's just another \"meh\" restaurant that serves everything on cutting boards. I'm normally one to like to experiment with new places and my wife and I, who frequent downtown Vegas regularly, always like to find new eateries and are fans of many of the places downtown. So tonight we decided to give The Smashed Pig a shot. You can tell the designers of this place were trying for the hip/cool look, with chairs that don't match, refrigerator white walls, virtually no art on the walls, servers looking unkempt, etc. It's sort of like dining in a prison cell, only less interesting.  First, we started with some cocktails. I had a Gin Fizz, which was served warm when it should have been on ice and my wife had some sort of Thyme-based cocktail which was a little better. For the price, neither were worth it. We should have had drinks over at the Downtown Cocktail Lounge prior instead. As for food, rather than eat the same ol' boring bill of fare (bangers & mash, fish & chips, etc.) we went for a selection of appetizers. We ordered a cold cut plate, Yorkshire Pop-overs, Spicy Crispy Shrimp, and the Crispy Deviled Eggs. All the food, generally, was quite good. It wasn't anything to rave about or tell our friends about, but it was good. For a trendy/hipster place, I expected a little better. So my food rating would probably be a 3 1/2 out of 5.  The reason I give this place a 2 rating is mostly due to the noise. Let me be very clear here, THIS RESTAURANT IS SO FUCKING LOUD INSIDE YOU CAN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK!!! I've been to Metallica concerts that were more relaxing than this place was. You literally have to scream across your table to have a conversation and I will guarantee you that after eating here, you will have a migraine afterward so be warned, bring plenty of Advil for your entire table before ordering. When I dine out, especially when I'm looking at a $70 tab for my wife and I, I like to relax a little bit when I eat, not require a megaphone to converse with my spouse across the table. The noise level is nothing short of obnoxious and my bet is the owners just don't care.  So overall, I'd say the food is worthy of trying if you haven't been there but I certainly would not return nor would I recommend it to friends.",

Sat at the bar, and went for tradition- yorkshire popovers, fish and chips(with mushy peas) and sticky toffee pudding.   Everything was great. Yorkshires were good, with an onion gravy. The fish, I thought at first, was small portioned- but it was just right. The crisp on the outside is top notch and the fish quality. Mushy peas- i've never had- were better than regular peas. The fries- only a small knock- were seasoned fries, kind of unusual for fish and chips. Very nice beers, as well. The menu selection is small, but that isn't always a knock- the beer selection is much bigger.   The sticky toffee. Um...unbelievable. I didn't really have room, but I did it anyways. If someone had dropped another, I would have eaten it. It's that good. The service was very friendly. Good place! Good vibe!",

Our waiter (never got a name) rushed us through appetizers. Only to then presented 3 of 4 meals without mentioning the 4th. After fix several minor issues with the 3 meals. We final ask about the 4th meal. 10 mins later it arrives. A different meal than what was ordered. Send it back, it arrives again this time it a rushed version missing most of the ingredients, confirmed with chef not what i ordered..  Ask the bartender to find a manager ( waiter is hiding at this point). Manager confirms wrong item sent outs. Sorta get an apology comped the sandwich that was screwed up 3 times and a pretzel. But at this point we have to run to make the movie. I get mistakes happen, but just be honest and dont try to cover it up and not acknowledge that is happened.",

You can grab something to bite and have entertainment when you're done. The prices were reasonable and fair. The bathrooms were clean. I have to say the thing that impressed me the most about this establishment was that the owner was the head chef. This person puts love into every dish. Kate and I split the crispy fried devils eggs and the braided pork baguette. The sandwich comes with a side so we got the potato salad. Everything was so darn good. At first I was disappointed because I didn't see a sauce in our sandwich but when you take your first bite you will feel rude trying to add anything to that sandwich. It was honestly perfection. The crispy deviled eggs were awesome too, I just wanted more of them. This place is a great experience and has unique taste I recommend you come in and grab some food. Also just to note they have a lunch and dinner menu. So pick the right part of the day if you're looking for a particular dish.",

    "text": "This place is INSANE!! We went around 8:30pm on Saturday and the place was relatively quiet so we weren't sure what to think. I think we missed the dinner crowd which was good for us! We truly thought that the service and food were over the top. Here are our highlights:  Shepherd's Pie: AMAZE-ing!! The meat is finely ground with carrots and is slow simmered in red wine, enough said.  Bangers and Mash: The bangers (aka sausage) are made in house and is phenomenal!  Fried deviled eggs: These were a fun treat but not a must. Definitely different and good but sometimes it's hard to mess with a good thing. We prefer the un-fried version ;)  Yorkshire pudding: The onion gravy has great flavor and the popovers are great. Only minor issue was that we got the last order of the evening so ours were a little over done.  Sticky toffee pudding: THE BEST EVER! I have had this dessert in other restaurants including Gordon Ramsay's pub. This one was much better in my opinion, super light and not overly dense. The toffee sauce was so intense, it was just at that point where you can tell they've made a caramel sauce before as to not burn it. I love that they used whipped cream and not ice cream for the topping. Light and heavenly.  The damage: About $80 after tax for two people -  two entrees and two apps, dessert plus a beer and a soda - GREAT value.  We will see you again, Smashed Pig!!",

We were seated within 5 mins on a Thursday night at 6.  The wife and I enjoyed Fish & Chips and Shepherds Pie.  Both were exquisite. The batter on the fish is so delicate that it just about melts in your mouth, while the Shepherds pie had a creamy mash top with a tasty mince meat underneath. All cooked expertly.  We started this meal with two drink from the cocktail menu.  Hoo has the Thyme - An amazing Bourbon mixed with syrup drink that is hard not to drink in on go.  God save the Queen - A cognac mixed drink that was less sweet and more sour that delighted my palette. Could not be happier as a Brit living in America.  We will definitely be coming back.",

It's a mish mash of anything they can throw together. It's nothing more than any other generic bar with food now. It's owned by some conglomerate and the quality is down. They have PBR ON TAP!!!!  For 4$. They are just doing the same get the drunks to come in thing that everyone else does. The music in here is some weird mix that more correctly belongs in a dark jazzy club but not exactly. It does NOT belong in this space.   Nothing is congruent. Nothing is unique. And it's bad. It's 7:13pm on a Thursday and there is no one here. Just me and my husband.   These are death throws. Jack of all trades, master of none. Anthony Bourdain would turn on his heels and walk out. Way to go conglomerate. This is nothing more than an Applebee's. More shitty mediocre food in the sea of shitty mediocre food in downtown.   I'm disappointed. And I'm not coming back.",

Lucky for us, the kitchen allowed us a chance to eat here.  Once we sat down everything turned amazing. We had the most attentive waitress. She noticed my surprise when the tartar came battered and offered to remove the dish from our table and bill. Totally my fault for not reading the menu but I really appreciated the gesture.   We tried the following;  Burger Steak Salmon Deviled eggs  Each dish was delicious and unique. My friends salmon took a little longer than the rest, so the waitress informed us that dessert was on them. Overall  all top notch.",

Downtown has done a great job of revitalizing itself over The course of the past 5 years so when we do come down here, we like to try something different. The Smashed Pig was a very unassuming restaurant that we initially had walked past. Once inside, we were greeted by friendly staff and a rather spacious abode. We ordered the green beans (free with check in at the time of this review) and the pretzel for starters. Both were excellent. The pretzel was surprisingly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, not dense as pretzels often are. For entrees we ordered the fish and chips and the impossible Swedish meatballs. As with the appetizers, both were very good. I would recommend the Smashed Pig to anyone looking for some good food in the downtown area.",

The decor was very modern rustic with some industrial flare (which I loved). The DJ was playing a variation of music, which my party and I really enjoyed.   After studying the menu, we decided on a combination of appetizers and a big plate for our table of four. We ordered Buffalo Wings, 2 Yum Yum Shrimp, Buffalo Fried Cauliflower, Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos and Fish & Chips for the four of us. We also ordered 2 glasses of wine and two Old Fashioneds.   Everything was really absolutely delightful! Shrimp, cauliflower and fish were perfectly crispy on the outside and cooked to perfection on the inside. Shrimp and cauliflower had the perfect amount of sauce. Bacon wrapped jalapenos had a perfect kick without being too spicy. And the wings of course were really good as well in their bold buffalo sauce. The biggest highlight for me was the Yum Yum Shrimp, this is a must try if you love shrimp dishes.   Service was attentive, prompt, I love the fact that she was quick with our drinks and checked on us often, ensuring we never ran out of water also, and checked on us once the food came out (big bonus considering how many servers I've had go MIA after food was served). The amount of appetizers was definitely enough for the four of us. We left this restaurant feeling happy and satisfied after our meal. We will definitely be back to sample other things in the menu and to have that shrimp again.",

Nice bistro type interior, intimate lighting, soft glow just enough to read the menu. Gastropub flavor offerings from deviled eggs, yum yum shrimp, wings, cheese balls for appetizers- we got the tempura green beans, nicely seasoned, crunchy batter and fresh green beans with a chipotle aioli.  The main courses offer grilled chicken, steak frites, roasted salmon, various bistro/pub style burgers and sandwiches. The fish and chips were crunchy in a PBR batter, chips and homemade Tatar sauce. I got the poached pear and buratta salad, they were out of the poached pears so the chef substituted roasted beets - vinaigrette was good but too overdressed, nice salad.  Service was excellent, they have an open kitchen view - good and bad, we can see in, but all the smoke and aromas lofted into our table and was a turn off because all you can smell is bacon, burned grease...so hint hint,! If you come here, ask to get a table near the front of the restaurant not by the kitchen.",

Our server made sure we even had extra bread to enjoy all that was on the charcuterie board! The cheeses were creamy, the sauces on point, and even yorkies reviled my own for flavor and texture. I have to say that the sticky toffee pudding reviled that from Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen! Coming back to explore the rest of the menu on our next trip!",

    "text": "Came in on a Tuesday night before a show at the Smith Center.  The location is nice since it's nearby.  Only issue is parking but since it was a Tuesday afternoon, it wasn't too hard to find a parking spot close by.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were the only ones there which is expected since it was only around 5 pm.  Slowly people started trickling in and all the tables were pretty much full by 6 p.m. with nobody waiting to get seated.  They have a bar at the front with sit-down tables towards the back by the kitchen. The bartenders and waiters were very nice and attentive.  We ordered the Deviled Eggs, German Soft Pretzel, Spicy Tater Bites, Bangers and Mash, and Pub Burger. Total came out to be around $66. We tried to order the Cheeseballs however they notified us they were sold out.   Review of the food: Deviled Eggs: Fried egg whites with yolk cream piped on top. Taste wise just like your typical deviled egg however since the egg white was deep fried, it did add a bit of a crunch which was a nice texture differentiation.   German soft pretzel: Came with two dipping sauces; beer cheese and mustard. Sauces were pretty solid however I do with they gave more of the beer cheese as the cup was pretty small for the size of the pretzel.  The pretzel was your typical pretzel. Some areas were thicker and overall less enjoyable then the thinner areas. Would only reorder if I had a huge craving for a pretzel as it was forgettable.  Spicy Tater bites: Did not come out as expected. Was imagining the typical tater tot when ordering this but what came out was small potatoes that were poaches/boiled. The center was scooped out and a sausage mix was stuffed in the middle with a slice of jalapeno on top. It was ok but probably would not order it again.  Bangers & Mash: You have to get bangers and mash when visiting a British pub.  The bangers (sausage) were quite tasty and covered in a onion gravy on top of mashed potatoes.  It was heavy and satisfying.  Pub Burger: Pretzel bun burger with a potato haystack (French fries) and egg.  Overall favorite thing ordered on the menu. Meat of the burger was tender, the potato haystack also helped give it a different texture and the sauce was particularly good. Would recommend ordering this if visiting this establishment. Comes with a side of fries where were of the thicker variety but fried just right, not overly crispy.  Conclusion: Would only come here if I had a craving for bangers and mash.  It was decent food but overall not very memorable.  One downside was we sat at the tables in the back and there was quite a bit of smoke coming from the kitchen seeping into the dining area. We all left smelling like food which is a downside since we went to go see a show at the Smith Center after and were sitting close by to other strangers.",

The drinks were on the expensive side but some were quite intricate so maybe worth it? NO happy hour yet... we were told that the new bar manager was working on it. Fried green beans tasted like it was in a funnel cake batter and greasy. The Cubano sandwich was also on the greasy side. Interesting to note that they have CBD Teas.... I can't leave a review on them as I didn't taste any but they have maybe 5 varieties. The 3 stars is for the amazing service and 2 negative stars is for the prices and greasy food.",

Started with the bacon wrapped cheese stuffed shishito peppers & fried devil eggs: both were excellent and nice twist of preparation & combinations. 4 pieces each were great for 8 of us... just enough to get the taste buds warmed up.   All 8 of us had different meals and no one was disappointed. The one common item for most plates were the sea salt fries... we probably could have order the desert because they were so good. The fish & chips was lighted breaded and tasty, blackened salmon with corn base was up for best meal, but the smashed Cubano took that honor.   Lastly the service was great all night. Bringing water before the glasses were empty - same with our adult beverages, removing dishes and checking in with us. Jesus was the best. We got free desert because our dishes didn't come out at the same time, which really wasn't necessary. Get the Chimi Cheese cake. It's worth every calorie.",

I don't know about anyone else but part of the reason I go to Vegas is to eat. Portions were too small for our taste. The food wasn't horrible but maybe a lil too experimental for our taste buds. Will definitely not recommend for someone going w/a big appetite. Prices were a bit much for a Downtown Vegas spot. No one in our group of 8 had anything good to say. We walked out pretty disappointed. Mac n cheese was recommended for our lil ones but it was spicy for them. Expect a 18% gratuity charge for larger parties, ours was 8 w/what was 3 lil ones.

    "text": "So after hearing rave reviews about this place I am thoroughly disappointed. We ordered appetizers. The Yorkshire popovers sound great but came out burnt. Looking at them, I wonder how those were allowed out of the kitchen... the only thing that slightly saved the dish was the onion gravy. We also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. Those were swimming in a \"sauce\" which was more like flavored oil served on too small baby romaine leaves that faltered under the weight of the filling. Maybe endive or less juice. We also ordered entrees. The bangers and mash was pretty good. Natural casing on the bangers and the gravy was tasty but the mashed potatoes were obviously boxed instant potatoes.... the worst burger I have ever had came next with \"garlic  sea salt\" fries. The burger tasted like they have not cleaned the grill since opening their doors and the cheese was almost non-existent. Was even offered another slice of cheese but feared I would be charged for an additional slice. The fries were tossed in garlic salt like you would buy from a grocery store. I don't know if the cooks were having an off day or were as smashed as the pig on their logo. Speaking of cooks... no hats with long hair and beards galore... health code???",

The bangers n mash were also just decent... Mashed potatoes lacked flavor and the sausages were just average. The service was great, though.",

She made us some unreal and unique drinks. The slow gin fizz was very intricate and tasted lovely. Out of my comfort zone but glad I tried it. The food was amazing. I actually ordered the same dish. Not once but twice. My stomach was more than happy and satisfied.   Tas thank you we will be back to see you :)",

Our great server was very knowledgable about the menu they put out and recommended their go to dishes. We'll be back next time for their butcher block special next time and some dessert but let's talk about what we ordered.   Crispy deviled eggs- I wish the portion was bigger because it was so good!   Mini Yorkshire pudding. Super crispy soft goodness with syrup and gravy was awesome again I wish I had more  Lamb tacos- I will say this was good but probably the least favorite of what we had the taco shell was great but the filling was just ok. The chutney they offer on the side gives this dish more depth in flavor but was missing something IMO.   Bangers and mash-what a great ending to our meal this sausage kinda brought us back to Thailand or laos. I think this version was a little more milder but was executed perfectly! Straight fire! Love it and would order it again for sure.   The best thing is watching our food being put out by the chefs in here they are putting their hearts into the food and we appreciate it! It definitely shows and we'll be back to enjoy some more. Oh yeah they make great beer here too!",

I'm not going to lie, when she brought out this dish I was skeptical - sausages and mashed potatoes with a bunch of onion gravy piled on top? It's not the most appetizing looking or prettiest looking plate, but damn was it good. The owner hails from England (I believe Liverpool) and makes his sausages in house. Everything there is made from scratch but let me tell you: the bangers and mash were SO WORTH IT. Mashed potatoes were on point, and together with the piping hot onion gravy and flavorful sausage, it was a flavor profile that was both comforting and exciting. I was so full after stuffing my face with as much of it as I could (was traveling for work and not planning on taking leftovers back with me, otherwise I would have saved it for later) that I couldn't take advantage of dessert here. Would love to come back and try their dessert crepes though, as well as lunch! Dinner for five people where each got an entree and drink and shared three appetizers only ended up being about $135 per tip, so this place is incredible affordable, especially for Vegas.",

It wasn't busy at all so we were able to easily sit at the bar. I do recommend parking around the corner on 6th since it can be kinda tricky to find a spot. I love the interior of this place, very simplistic yet trendy. Gotta love the pig decor too!   As far as the food goes I was not disappointed. I chose to go with the sashimi of the day which was salmon along with a house salad. The sashimi was good, but not anything too different than you're typical sushi joint. The salad was very good too. It was a much bigger portion than I expected and the dressing had a very light ginger flavor. My coworker had the meat and cheese plate which looks awesome. It had a few different cheeses including Brie, blue cheese and Gouda along with some prosciutto, salami and some homemade pickles.   Overall I'm happy I got to try this place out and would love to come back again to see what the dinner atmosphere is like.",

The house salad earned this place it's 5 stars alone.  Fresh mixed greens and I had the citrus vinaigrette dressing.  Delicious!  Nicely they waited until I was finished with my salad before bringing my main dish.  I don't like places that shovel your food in front of you.  The fish was flavorful and flakey.  The batter was nice and light, it complemented the fish rather than replace and over power it.  The chips (fries) had a nice flavor.  It is served with a tarter sauce. I am not a tarter sauce guy but I Troyes this and it was really good with a horse radish finish.  I still went with the vinegar but enjoyed a few bites with the horse radish.  To wrap up this place had a great vibe.  The  ambiance, music, staff were all great.  This was an unexpected find but very happy I did!",

The food.......wow, the food. Started with the deviled eggs (crispy fried) and the buffalo fried cauliflower. Both super delicious and unique for appetizers. The burgers are on point and have tons of flavor. One of our mixed drinks came in a small bathtub...talk about fun! Try this place out. Well worth the time and money spent there.",

None of the items we were excited about were on the new menu. Nothing about a new menu was posted on their website. Table next to us expressed similar frustration when I asked waitress about something on previous menu.   Waitress was pleasant enough but wasn't informed on new menu. Ordered the stuffed yukon potatoes and was underwhelmed and questioned the \"done-ness\" of the sausage.   In the end two of us got the burger with egg on it. It was good but both of us agreed it was too salty. Fries were excellent. Other person got the BLTA and was very happy.   Slightly overpriced but could do a lot worse at other places downtown. Overall a lackluster experience at a restaurant still struggling to find its identity.",

We had the special of the day (chicken burger sliders with fries), the shrimp sliders, and a burger. The shrimp sliders were sensational. Served with a vibrant and fresh salad complete with a citrus dressing made to beat the heat! The chicken was not a tasteless and dry breast, it was a burger filled with spice and flavor. Served on an incredible bun, perfectly toasted with a delicious sauce! Burger was exceptional! Perfectly cooked and served with fries, which were lightly coated in a garlic and salt mixture! Service was exceptionally kind and got us seated and served quickly! Would suggest for a quick lunch, lingering dinner, or a midday snack. All the happy hour appetizers and drinks looked spectacular! Would love to return here!",

While the bartender sits you by his bar like its your own, you will talk about all things yummy and happy. The chef and owner of this newly opened Pub originates its flavors from around the world and is a Liverpool Native who was married to a lovely Filipina (may she rest in peace), handles your food like you visited from college into their dining room for thanksgiving dinner. We met him and chatted about his \"Chef's Bloc\" for 2, and we trusted whatever it is he can create, we shall conquer and devour. From it's appetizers of sashimi tartare and uniquely fried deviled eggs, paired with beautiful drinks, our main course sits on a chopping board---Roast Beef +yorkshire pudding (thanks Cameron Milligan, it was good/AMEN) with potatoes, asparagus, and what I believe would be sliced Fennel. I not only highly recommend it as a foodie, but if you eat here with love, you will experience the joy of being part of this great invention of indulgence. (--and u wanna bring me when you go!)",

Great service from every person there and the cocktails were outstanding as well. Excellent value for the price point in elegant and cozy surroundings. Thanks for making it a night to remember!!

My husband and I split the butcher's board, which was fried chicken with biscuits, potatoes, roasted veggies and salad. Everything was amazing but I saw some red liquid and asked the waitress about it so she brought the chef out. He looked and assured me everything was fine, it was just the bone. He offered to get me something else and I assured him everything was amazing and it wasn't necessary. However, he brought out a shrimp salad, which we sent around the table and everyone agreed it was fantastic.

I ordered fish and chips with the yummy mashed peas. When the server served our food, she accidentally knocked the extremely HOT peas in to my lap and ALL over my white jeans. Not pretty, if you can imagine, and I couldn't get it out of my jeans, after washing, but I will try it again. I understand that accidents happen, of course, and the waitress did apologize, but the peas were hot, burned my leg because they just stuck to my pants like hot glue, the reminisce hit the floor and I had to sit there for the remainder of the meal with messy peas on the floor, that were slippery-I was wearing Tory Burch's Miller Sandals. Also, I had to ask for the side of peas (because they are yummy) that were dropped on my pants, instead of the server automatically bringing them. No regard, not even a comped drink or a \"sorry\" dessert. As I said, accidents do happen, and it wasn't the servers fault-the food is served on butcher block trays and it's no wonder the cups of ketchup, tarter sauce and HOT mushy peas can easily be knocked into your lap.  My skin where the hot peas were glued to my jeans is tender, today. I'll try to wash my jeans a few more times, in hopes the green hue comes out. Not sure I'll be back-we were supposed to eat at Carson's Kitchen, but they were closed for expansion.",

Imagine my surprise when we sat at the bar and there staring me in the face from the bar fridge was...you guessed...a large bottle of Triple Carmelite.  I had the chicken quesadillas and the green beans which you get comped with a Yelp check-in.",

    "text": "As a Brit who sometimes gets nostalgic what with living in the desert, I decided to try The Smashed Pig (TSP) because from what I have seen, they serve some English classics as well as burgers, sandwiches etc and I was interested to see their interpretation of these.  In a prime spot downtown, TSP surprisingly doesn't come across as anywhere near British despite choosing to serve some of the food. That's not to say it's got a bad vibe, in fact, it's generally clean (other than a bit of stick on the table), spacious without feeling cold, comfortable and contemporary with bar upfront where you can sit and a proper restaurant area at the back with open kitchen.  We came on a Saturday night during a busy event night downtown, but were able to be seated straight away and service throughout was great, with server, chef and bar staff approaching us with big smiles and kind rapport.  The menu, both for food and drinks, is quite small, but they have a few different things, so there should be something to accommodate for everyone!  We had a lovely cocktail and a beer before choosing the Yorkshire pop overs (mini yorkshire puds) and the green bean tempura (free Yelp check in treat) as appetisers.   I was very curious to try their Yorkshires because this is staple in our traditional dinners, but unfortunately they were nothing to rave over. Not totally cooked through and very bland. The texture on the outside was great but they definitely needed some (more) salt and the onion gravy was bland too. There was a very spicy horseradish type of garnish on the side, which was too spicy to be honest, but at least gave the dish some flavour I suppose.  The green bean tempura on the other hand was great! Great size, tasty but not overly greasy and a lovely chipotle sauce to accompany. Would definitely get that again.  For mains, we both went for the fish and chips. Again, I am a fish and chip connoisseur and had the traditional kind from the chippy (fish n' chip shop) growing up, so I really hoped they wouldn't mess this up! Definitely some good and not so good to this main.  The good? BEST battered fish that I've had in Vegas so far! Americans seem to like the beer-battered fish and try to fancy it up and imo, ruin it! This batter was light, not greasy, partly crunchy and partly soft. Just PERFECT! The fish itself was soft, flakey and delicious!  Chips would have been great if they hadn't have over salted them, but the real let down was the 'smashed pea fritter'. I love mushy peas, but despite seeing them on the Yelp menus, THEY DON'T SERVE MUSHY PEAS HERE! I was disappointed that they already prepare the fritters so you can't ask for it just to come out without the deep fried batter. Also, they have tried to fancy it up with herbs and citrus flavours.  In all, a good fish n chips though.  Lastly, we had to try the sticky toffee pudding because again, it's an English classic. It was a little different to the English puddings, but definitely still good! Not as dense as I'm used to which was welcomed after a fried dinner and served with some cream and strawberry ice cream, which was great!  In all, TSP is a great spot! I wouldn't say they serve traditional English food, but they serve their own interpretation, which can be just as good or not as good depending on what you order. I would return for the fish, but pass on the fritter next time!",

Waiter didn't seem to be great with English and didn't understand the drink menu. I ordered a PB Stout. I even pointed to it on the menu. Waiter brings me a very light beer in a PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) glass. I explain that there's no way that's a stout as it's so light. It's definitely a PBR. No, he says, it's the stout. It's just in a PBR glass. He knows it.!Sorry, chief. Not a chance in Hell. He comes back later with the can and pours the correct stout into a separate glass. Kind of a difference. See the pic. We order a few orders of the cheese balls with goldfish-brand cracker coating. They were ok, but nothing to write home about. We all ordered the Cubano sandwich, which is the house speciality. I've had a lot of Cuban sandwiches, and this may've been the worst. Dry pork, not great bread, and about the only thing we could taste were the pickles. Fries were kind of tasteless as well. Server disappeared, didn't refill water glasses, and was generally nonexistent. To top it off, he charges me for two beers because I had to send the first one back. Dinner ended up being close to $30/person for a sandwich, fries, a beer, and a few buck towards the app. Sorry, but this was the first Yelp stop in Vegas to not live up to the hype.",

We ordered the following:  Yum Yum Shrimp - No \"spicy firecracker sauce\"at all. If anything just sweet...almost similar to orange chicken - Decent nothing to rave about.  Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke - Lovely presentation, but the efficacy  of eating it was low - Meh, wouldnt get it again.  Green Bean Tempura - a bit overcooked, with way too much batter. It was like eating a funnel cake. But the spicy mayo was pretty bomb!  Deviled eggs - Delicious cholesterol raising fried goodness!  Buffalo Cauliflower - Really good, but anything deep-fried is usually good. Kind of lacked the buffalo sauce, and seemed as if they lightly brushed them with the mildest buffalo sauce on earth.  Tuna Steak Sandwich - Where do I begin. Two of us got this sandwich, and had similar comments. First of, it's supposed to be a seared tuna. Mine came well done. I'm not a professional chef, but I'm pretty sure seared tuna should still be pink in the middle. They brought me out another sandwich since that once wasn't cooked right. However, my friends was cooked perfectly, but she said her tuna had a not so fresh aroma. Mine didn't have the same smell, but there was no flavor. The bun that it was served on was hard, probably stale, and cold...& Served with greasy limp fries. (Disclaimer: I actually enjoy soggy fries - but I noticed in the comments that a lot of people do not - so expect that)  Other than the food, there was a great vibe going on in there. They had a DJ playing some early 90's jams. My friends said the drinks were alright  \\_()_/   Overall I'm not impressed, and would possibly go back to try the impossible meatballs with very low expectations.",

We had to place our orders at the front from chalkboards (Based on Heidi's review they changed from butcher paper to chalkboards. Okay, as it might save a tree).  As well, I see another review were they were actually seated...we got a number and seated ourselves.  We even had to walk up to the kitchen and ask for more sauces, as once our drinks were delivered and then food, no one ever stopped by our table.  As for the food - meh.  There were three (3) in our party, and beyond the juicy Smashed Burger, nothing was outstanding, and actually the comment from the burger-eater was it was \"okay.\" The fried green beans were very good - but not enough of a \"saving grace.\"  Would I return?  Not likely.",

    "text": "Okay so where do I start I live downtown so I'm a pretty regular at most of these restaurants down here I've been seeing the smashed Pig and have been wanting to try it for some time now my cousin is in town from Hawaii so we decided to try it. Okay with the name smashed Pig I would expect a lot more things on the menu that had to do with pork or at least a barbecue sandwich I was a bit disappointed to see that the menu is super small with not alot of pork products ummm the name is smashed pig. Moving on.. the staff was extremely nice with a lot of personality and had no problems to communicating with us once so ever I found that to be really delightful and enjoyable, so A++++ there! The restaurant is nice clean and well put-together. So now for what you all really want to know the \"food\" I hate to say it but I think I'm going to have to go with average unfortunately there wasn't really anything special about the food there it was kind of bland flat and not a lot of flavor but on that note it wasn't bad either I might possibly give this place one more try but as of right now my review stands with average.",

I'll say the food was good and tasty, portion a bit small though. The waitress a tall lady in a tee shirt and jeans, add 20% tip on a party of 5, i'm a great tipper. ... my company allows more than 20% tip so that not the problem it's just the thought that she thinks she deserve that amount, for sub par rude service. when I left i explained that I usually leave a larger tip than 20% but you must assume that what you deserve, She Said in a snotty condescending voice\"you can leave me more\".  So on the way out I approached the other waitress And told her that the other waitress automatically put a 20% tip or a bill she said \"that it was common for a party of six\" I said we were only a party of five, that got a inquisitive look.  I explained to her that if a waitress doesn't care about her job or her customers she really shouldn't  be a waitress.    This will be the last place that I eat if i'm in Vegas!!!!! There are to many restaurants that  want a $250++ table and appreciate our business.   eat at Mac Donald's at least they smile!",

    "text": "Beware: Do Not Order the Shepards Pie unless you like food Microwaved for 10minutes+   I'm pretty shocked by the high ratings. I guess I shouldn't expect much from Vegas tourists.  Service: 3.5 Stars. Arrived at 830 Saturday night. Table of 8 sat before my table of 2. One waitress on staff and the host who became our waiter for the evening. Restaurant was not full.  Wait time for food: 1 star. 30 minutes passed  after we ordered and I was able to watch the kitchen serve 3 other tables. During that time I saw the kitchen heat up 3 different orders of their Shepard's Pie in the MICROWAVE... 10 minutes each, 2 of them at the same time and then one individually. Then pop them in the oven to brown the top. I was speechless.  I was shocked especially since we ordered Shepards Pie. We changed our order from the Shepards Pie and told the waiter why. I watched him tell the chef, and you could tell the chef was not surprised/embarrassed or did not care. Waited a total of 50 minutes. By then the restaurant only had 3 other tables seated. We contemplated leaving many times thru the wait, but tried to give the place the benefit of the doubt since all the yelp reviews.   Food 2.5 stars Wilbur's Gin Fizz -was interesting. Seemed a little weak, but easy to overlook.   Glass of Wine -standard  Crispy Deviled Eggs- was good. Nice spice, little pickle gave it a nice acid kick.   Shepards Pie- microwaved as standard practice. I asked the waiter if it was standard to microwave. He just looked at me in embarrassment and said he could change the order.   Steak Frites-fries were good lol. Steak was a thin piece of really salty meat. Could only get thru a portion of it. And at 26$ it was really disappointing.   Salmon- skin burnt black, by then we were already over the long wait so we just peeled it off and hoped for the best. Mediocre.    Total Cost of meal: $84 and still added 20% tip because our waiter/host was nice.  There are a ton of great places to eat downtown and many of them wouldn't be caught dead with a microwave in the kitchen. It's shameful to charge $40+ a head for reheated food.  Next time you want something British inpired, go to Cornish Pasty. For Deviled eggs go to Carson Kitchen. They make everything fresh daily.",

We fell in love with The Griffin Bar review but they don't serve food! So we decided to eat next door at the Smashed Pig and then move on to the bar. OH MY GOD. Divine intervention?! The Smashed Pig is a little hole in the wall that should be Packed! I am from Seattle so I am used to great places to eat. This place made my whole trip! Granted, it was my birthday. I wanted to get steak. But all the steak houses were SUPER expensive! So we decided to just go to a great bar after eating here. Wow. I'm not kidding. I had the best Margarita  made from scratch! None of this sweet and sour mix that tastes like processed kid drinks. Real lime, lemon, tequila, triple sec. I asked him to add some simple syrup cuz I like sweet. It was The Best! I usually make my own at home and this was BETTER! They have a small menu but fear not, I ordered the Sheppard's pie which came with a side salad made with field greens and vinaigrette. It was amazing. I asked for a full salad and they brought it out and it really hit the spot. Fresh, delicious. When the bartender Alex (Tatoos, piercings, baseball cap and so very genuine) asked how everything was.... I told him it was my birthday (48 but I feel like 28). He congratulated me and said my drink was on the house. Then he brought out a complimentary dessert for me! Toffee pudding with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. OMG! It was sooooooo good. You have to order this! I'm going to dream about it. OMG. Seriously. Food was great, service was great. I will come back here. What a memorable evening. Thank you Alex. You made my whole day.",

Sticky toffee pudding had pretty good flavor but people are nuts if they think it's better than Gordon Ramsay's.  I actually think they make it ahead of time and microwave it.  That's not great but can't complain when the Fish & Chips are so good.",

Our party of 12 had just come from a wedding and of all the dining options in the area, we chose this place for lunch to celebrate with the bride and groom (and yes, we called ahead to make sure they could take us). I don't know if the problem was our server or something in the kitchen, but my husband and I were the only ones who got our orders without a problem (the fish and chips were delicious, along with the crispy onions).   Some of the folks in our party got their check before their food had even arrived; one person never got his meal - he left to find something to eat somewhere else. Others got the wrong thing, one ordered lettuce wraps without mushrooms and got them anyway. A young woman in our group FINALLY got her burger, long after her parents had already finished their food. Several were waiting for their sodas, and had to ask several times for their order. No one even bothered to mention the daily specials to us, which would've been a big improvement over the very limited standard lunch menu; our fault for not seeing the signboard outside, but still our server should've made sure we knew about the lunch specials. At one point, we realized people at another table (who came in after we did) were getting their food before we did because our server brought it to our table by mistake.   We paid the minimum tip because other than my husband having to ask three times for his diet soda, we were luckier than others in our group. As far as I know, management made no effort to make things right when it came time to settle the other tabs.",

Next I had the lamb tacos paired with a local beer and again I could not believe how good they were. The presentation and more importantly to me the complexity of the flavors, they just completely blew me away! I travel a lot and always look for good gastropubs but this is at the top of my list.

The lamb tacos with crispy eggplant shell sounded odd, but turned out to be crispy bites of lamb curry goodness! Also had the tempura green beans- so crisp and fresh tasting. You can tell its fresh oil. No off taste. Sit near the kitchen like we did. Definitely fun to watch the chefs in action. I would say this pub is the hidden gem of downtown. Near the tourist action of Fremont St but does not have the tourist feel. Feels local and cool. Oh and save room for the sticky toffee pudding! Wow!!!",

We ordered the lamb tacos, sashimi and mini Yorkshire puddings to start. All were delicious, but the lamb tacos were OUTSTANDING. Then we shared one butcher block special between the four of us. That night it was super crisp and super moist fried chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy and coleslaw. Not a crumb was left. For dessert we had the crepes and trifle- again not a crumb was left. Three of us had coffee and all four of us had a cocktail. Total bill with tip (extremely good service) was under $38 per person. Great value for great food!!!!",

If we hadn't had dinner reservations that night we would have tried much more since the pub smelled amazing as the cooks prepped for the dinner crowd. We are hoping to stop in again before we leave Vegas. Prices were super reasonable ($10 for 3 generously sized tacos)  and $10-$12 signature cocktails.",

Cheeky bugger, crispy deviled eggs, braised pork baguette, fish tacos & sticky toffee pudding to name just a few. Chef Martin actually came out of the kitchen to discuss menu changes for a celiac's diet. Never seen a more unpretentious and talented chef all rolled into one!

We were greeted at the door and told the lunch specials.  We ordered the Chicken Tacos special, Two Smashed Pig Burgers, a Salmon Salad, Fried Deviled Eggs and Tempura Green Beans.  We ordered at the bar and they served us at the table.  The food was excellent and the service was good.  The French Bean Tempura ($7): was \"crack,\" has Yelpers have noted. Tempura with chipotle mayo and toasted almond slivers.  We ended up ordering two more servings and ate all of i  Crispy Deviled Eggs ($8): lightly fried served with tiny sweet pickle slices and dusted w/ paprika. They were OK.  The ones at EATS are better IMO  The Smashed Pig Burger ($14): was good.  Cooked they way I like it and juicy, served with Sea Salt fries that were warm & crispy.    I definitely recommend this restaurant and I will go back on my next visit to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "\"This is a poor man's Carson Kitchen,\" my boyfriend groused, as he paid our $40 bill for four great-sounding apps that failed to wow us. I expedited my visit here based on a friend's recent rave review (Chris V), and ordered several similar dishes, only to find most options underseasoned with a better version merely on the other side of the block.  FRENCH GREEN BEANS: Tempura beans with spicy mayo and toasted almonds. I like the cooking method and these were solid, and admirably light on grease. But the nearby CK has a larger portion with a great dipping sauce that this version can't hold a candle to. TODAY'S SASHIMI/TARTARE (TUNA POKE): This was just okay. Poke was oddly seasoned with large chunks of onion and a lot of spice, rather than the citrus-garlic-ponzu punch I'd been anticipating. It was really fresh though. LAMB TACOS: The dish I was most anticipating, with a clever concept of crafting a taco shell from fried eggplant. I really enjoyed the sweet pepper chutney, which was reminiscent of a ratatouille. But the lamb itself lacked the familiar, meaty flavor. Seemed to lack any sort of seasoning whatsoever. CRISPY DEVILED EGGS: A fried egg white with nicely fried crispy texture, topped with a bland but creamy egg yolk filling, and entirely too much paprika. I had anticipated a version similar to a Thai hard-boiled egg, yielding a barely-cooked yolk. This just didn't work for me. Other that the paprika, there wasn't much going on... and for $8/4 pieces, CK's version with caviar is the better option.  I was dying to try their sticky toffee pudding, but my BF refused to order anything else and experience additional frustration. Around this time, our server disappeared for a solid 20 minutes and eventually the super-sweet food runner settled our bill for us. This spot has great decor and the menu all sounds like food I'd love, but the execution and/or consistency are just not there at this time- perhaps Chris and I had different chefs working on our visits? I'm too hopeful not to give them another try sooner or later, but right now I'm underwhelmed.",

And I loved it!). The Black Cab tasted like Bath and Body Works warm vanilla sugar... but as a drink!  My friend had a cocktail called Downtown Pimms it was amazing and tasted like the remains of a slurpee! :)  The staff were attentive and our bartender Chase was great all around (even chased me down to return my credit card I left at the bar). It's very cutely themed and they have a good food menu. They also have a vegetarian option every day... We didn't try the food but saw what everyone else was having and it definitely looked good. Especially the dessert.",

The bartender was very patient and friendly as we dithered over what to eat.  I finally settled on the Kim chee pork tacos, my son predictably got a burger, and my friend Sherri got a pulled pork baguette with fried onions.  The food came quickly, and was enormous.  My three tacos were really too big to eat as tacos, as the tortillas fell apart under the strain.  Eaten with a fork the Kim chee and pork was tasty, as was the salad that came with it.  Sherri's fried onions were delicious, as was my son's burger and fries, and I'm not much for burgers and fries!  We were all so full after that, but somehow decided to get not one but two desserts, the sticky toffee pudding and the crepes.  The sticky toffee pudding was better, the crepes were a bit too sweet even with the fresh oranges and orange liqueur, but the crowning glory was my manhattan.  That was a good dessert.  Unexpectedly delicious affordable food, nicely made drinks and super friendly service.",

By both the length of wait for it to come out to the table and by the temperature to the touch, it had to have been sitting in the back for a while. I don't like room temperature food if I'm paying the restaurant for hot food. It was disappointing. - The bun itself was refrigerator cold. It had definitely just come out of the cooler. It would be much better warm and softer. - I saw my waitress exactly once in between taking my order and bringing me the check. She was also tending the bar and constantly making trips to the back part of the restaurant in addition to making drinks. She clearly didn't have time to come out to my table. Service is nearly as important to me as the quality of food when making recommendations.  - between waiting for my order to be taken, waiting extra time for the food, and waiting for the check - even after I asked for it - I lost 20 to 30 minutes. I'd rather have been doing other things.",

Mini Fish and chips was very tasty! I'm not usually a fan of fish and chips but this was very tasty and crispy!   Fried green beans was a free app we got for checking in on yelp and it was good with a Smokey spicy chipotle dip.  Pork belly tacos were just okay not bad but the pork was over cooked so a little chewy flavor was good though with a little spice.  This was a great find! We will be back for a full dinner one day soon their menu looks great.    I will have to try their hogwash specialty drink next time we come in, it looks unique and tasty!",

The decor is artsy but modern and the over all restaurant is intimate. We were seated in the very back which showcased an open kitchen environment, we loved the theater of that.   Drinks:  We ordered the hogwash which comes in a bath tub holder with a floating rubber pig! We loved it, tasted like a fresh moitjio. Also ordered the cucumber refresh with vodka, and also the bourbon colada...  the bourbon colada came with charred pineapple and was one of the best drinks I have ever tasted. Highly recommend.  Food: we received the free green bean tempura with yelp checkin- came with a spicy aioli. These were delicious if you love spicy!   We got an order of the chicken wings-1/2 buffalo and 1/2 sweet chili- wings were on point! Decent amount of meat and tender.   The shishito peppers bacon wrapped cream cheese stuffed- drooool. We like them better then bacon wrapped jalapenos.   The deviled eggs we were most excited about, however fell flat for us on the flavor side, we were anticipating a more dill cream flavor, but they were bland.   Also ordered the bang bang shrimp- bomb!   Amazing drinks, cool vibes and everything you need and want from a Gastropub- good flavor and creativity.   We will return / no pics of food- we chowed down and forgot",

I ordered a salad the waiter said was the most popular, greens with apple and some sort of cheese.  I also ordered the chicken/corn soup ( menu said made fresh daily). Both were completely lacking in appearance and flavor.  The salad was not anything special and had so little flavor the only redeeming element was the way to small portion of bursts cheese.  The soup was the worst.  No flavor and filled with noodles that overwhelmed the bowl.  A picture is worth 1,000 words so I will leave you with that.  The restaurant was not crowded and the service was good but there is no incentive to return due to lack of any flavor in the dishes.",

The restaurant doesn't look like a hole in the wall or anything, but when you're in flashy downtown Las Vegas it's hard to stand out.  What looks like just another restaurant just off of the Fremont experience is a gem of an eatery called The Smashed Pig.   In all honesty, the name is what drew my attention to it on Yelp while my coworkers and I were searching out dinner options. My coworkers kindly went along with my suggestion of checking this place out, and we all ended up agreeing that this place was the best out of the restaurants we visited on this trip!  Seating is roomy and the decor is modern. Service was on point and our server gave us a thoughtful and honest opinion when we had questions about items on the menu.   We ordered an appetizer for each of us to start, which included tempura green beans, cheese balls, and buffalo cauliflower. All were prepared beautifully and flavor was totally on point. The sauce for the cheese bites and the green beans were the same but matched well with either. The buffalo cauliflower assaulted our noses with a sauce that had more bark than bite, but we still thoroughly enjoyed the flavor.   Then our main meal arrived (timed perfectly btw). I ordered the mushroom burger- I think I played it safe, but as far as burgers go this one was tasty. My coworkers got the steak frites and the bangers and mash. I think all three of us barely contained ourselves from licking our plates clean.   We were definitely pleased with our visit and would totally recommend The Smashed Pig to anyone looking for a solid meal a short walk away from the crowds.",

The top it all, one of the managers kept yelling at the cooks which makes a horrible impression especially when our table is right there. Unlike other places I dined in this week, this one didn't seem to have a happy staff and the food reflected that. Yelling at your staff is bad for both customers and your employees/food!",

The meat and cheese plate was good, but then again, how can you really mess that up? Lol. Thank goodness for Brie! The fried deviled eggs were definitely unique, but I wish there was a little bit more spice or seasoning. There was something really off about the lamb tacos that I didn't like. It could've been the way the eggplant shell was prepared? Not too sure. My boyfriend didn't even finish his burger which was a first.  Service was great, but I'm most likely not coming back.",

I appreciate Ian updating me on the fries, which I don't really eat very often, but when I want to eat some they need to be with it.  Had the delicious Impossible Burger.  Here, the bread was unique. I can't even really describe it other than it was in 3 sections, almost as if you could break them apart.  Reminded me of ciabatta.  So I'll go with that.  It was really good tho.  Had a Rye Whiskey Mother in Law again and again, it's worth it.  Now for the fries.  As you can tell from my new rating, they were really good. Hot, fresh, golden.  Lightly salted. They were worth the spike in blood sugar.    The bottom line is, this place has great drinks, awesome burgers and now complimentary fries.  Give them a shot!",

For dessert you must try the sticky toffee pudding. My only complaint with the pudding is that the portion was a little small, which is different from the generous portion of the other items. Decor was nice, bar area also clean and nice. And I've never had a problem with service. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Saturday Night, Downtown Fremont Street, long wait times at near by restaurants lead us to the most amazing find yet! The Smashed PiG!! it was the Crispy Devilled Eggs posted on their menu in the window that lured us in. Figured we had an hour before we would be called to be sat where we had planned on eating that night, however once our taste buds experienced the unique flavors of the Crispy Devilled Eggs, we cancelled! and that's when our food adventure began. After ordering a LostCoast DowntownBrown Ale, we placed our order for the French Bean Tempura. The fantastic layering of flavors with the chipotle mayo and toasted almonds had us hooked. Absolutely one of the most fabulous starters I have ever had. Intrigued by 'Bacon Bourbon' I decided to indulge in a Specialty Pigtail named Sooie Smash. 'Ol Major Bacon Bourbon, Orgeat Syrup, Fresh Lemon and Mint. Total hit! (i had two) Felling good and wanting just a little more, asked about the Lamb 'Tacos'. The look on her face, as she expressed they were her fav, was enough to get an order in. Once again, our mouths were in awe with the interesting preparation of the savory lamb wrapped in a crispy eggplant 'taco shell'. Topped with sour cream with a side of the sweet pepper chutney, put it over the top. Totally satisfied by this point, we inquired about the creations we had experienced. We were very please when we were introduced to Chef Han (Hansel Tan) who spent the time sharing how and where each dish was developed. knowing we preferred the darker beers, Chef Han then suggested a taste of Modern Times Black House Oatmeal Coffee Stout NITRO, which was brought to us in addition to blessing our table with a Sticky Toffee Pudding. Many thanks to the creative genius of Chef Han.....WOWwowWOW. Looking forward to tasting everything on the menu.",

    "text": "While in Vegas, we tried this new (new for us) Gastropub. It was close to our hotel and was a nice change from the buffets.  It was odd to order and pay for the meal before being seated. It was equally odd that no one was really available to describe the menu.  So, we ordered the deviled eggs, tempura beans, and sushi du jour.  The eggs had a dried crust on the top which looked as if they had been sitting under the heat lamp. Additionally, there was a glob of mustard under each piece (to keep from sliding) that sort or \"shocked\" the taste buds (didn't like it). The beans were good, but I think serving the chipotle mayo on the side would be better to allow customers to 'dip' as needed; however, I repeat, the beans were done nicely.  The sushi was presented nicely, but no chopsticks to eat with; when asked if chopsticks were available, the server seemed confused with my question.  We may go back to try other items next time we visit but we were a bit nonplussed by our first experience. Oh yeah, please ask if we are done eating BEFORE pulling the plate and utensils from us.  Thank you.",

We walked in and were greeted by some friendly faces and were instructed how the process works. You order first from the bar at the entrance [you drinks as well], and then your seated to wait for your order to arrive. This reminds me of the pubs in England that I've been to.  We had ordered many different items to get a taste of all the different varieties of dishes on their menus.  This is where I was a little confused with the menu sported asian fare. It didn't really fit the theme of the restaurant, but we ordered anyways just see to see what was unique and different.  The Charcuterie platter was great. The Crunchy Deviled eggs was also a favorite, I personally liked the Tempura French Green Beans, The blackened chicken sliders was another hit! The Ahi tartar did well and the Fish and chips were crunchy and light.  The Teriyaki Skewers seemed to do alright, the dressing was hit and miss, perhaps a more \"brighter\" and \"lighter\" might do well with the choice of spring greens.  Overall, the staff was friendly, service was quick, and the atmosphere was perfect for such an occasion!  If you're looking for something different from all the other places on Fremont street, this place does stand out! Enjoy some good drinks, a friendly atmosphere, and some good food. I didn't get to try the bangers and mash, But I did see it at another table and it did look epic!  Have a great time! Cheers!  :]",

I ordered a virgin bloody mary which are a huge pain because you have you make and shake a drink with 15 ingredients and garnishes, then rinse off all your utensils from the tomato juice and not even get to sell a shot of booze. I apologized for my drink order (but planned on tipping extra for it.) The bartender said he didn't mind and made me two of them with a smile. I went to the kitchen and tipped the cook for the best veggie burger Ive ever had too. Cute little place. Its a small place so I bet on the weekends you can't just walk in at dinnertime and expect the fast high paced service like you do at a huge chain. There is literally one server one bartender two cooks, so slow yourself down and try to enjoy life for an hour.",

That is always nice.    The layout - I read a few reviews on people complaining about the layout. Really? Do you think there's a better way of setting up a restaurant that doesn't have that much of an option? This is such an odd thing to complain about. If you can fit your ass into a place to eat, and you're not on top of each other, you'll be fine. I assure you.   The food was good. It is like a few other places around the area. Not really sticking to a certain type of cuisine. We had- Lamb tacos. I wasn't a fan of the eggplant, but I did love the lamb.  Bangers and mash: I really don't like sausage. And I mean that all the way around. ;) But my fiance loved it. The gravy was pretty tasty.  Steak Frites - I ordered it medium rare, but it came out well done. So that was a disappointment. The fries were super good though. I'm usually not a fan of steak fries. But they were very tasty.   Overall, we'll go back. They do have a 2 person Butcher Block special seems very reasonable for the large platter they give you. We'd like to go back and try that. The prices are decent. Pretty normal for around the area. Definitely more reasonable that the strip prices.",

    "text": "This review is purely for the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which is quite possibly one of the best desserts I've ever had.   My boyfriend and I enjoyed dinner this evening at a nearby downtown restaurant. When dessert-time came, none of the offerings struck my fancy, so we hit up Yelp, hoping to find the perfect place to satisfy my sweet tooth.   It only took one glance at the Gastropub's Yelp page before I was yanking my boyfriend down Fremont Street. I have a soft spot for sticky toffee bread pudding (if you've never had it before, OMG stop reading right now and ORDER IT ALREADY) and the photos looked just too good to pass up.   We timidly sat at the bar, a bit embarrassed that we were only coming for dessert. But our bartender, Chase, was awesome, and assured us that people actually come only for the dessert on a regular basis!  The pudding was piping hot, covered with a huge scoop of homemade whipped cream, and smothered in warm toffee sauce. The pudding, by the way, is English style -- meaning, it's a soft and tasty cake! It's NOT anything like what Americans know pudding to be. So don't be confused if you're a Yank.   We will definitely be back to try their dinner offerings -- including the Butcher Block special for two, which we hear changes every night. Yum!   Thanks for the delicious dessert, Smashed Pig! We are big fans!",

This charming gastro pub is clean, the staff is super friendly, menu has something for everyone.    We had to try the tempura green beans, chicken lettuce cups, shrimp sliders with fries and their burger that should be famous soon.  I appreciate fresh ingredients since that is how I cook at home.  I also appreciate food made with fresh cooking oil.  It was obvious to me that the chef takes tremendous pride in creating every dish.  It was obvious in the generous portion sizes, food presentation, quality of ingredients and most importantly, the flavor.     We just stopped in for lunch and we're looking forward to coming back for a lovely dinner soon.   Thank you to the staff, chefs and the owners of The Smashed Pig.  Can't wait to come back!!!!  February 2016: We came back and brought my father in law with us.  I was looking forward to exposing him to the flavours here and the chefs and staff here did it again.  Excellent food and service!  We tried oysters on the half and OMGEEZUS... They were sweet, fresh and kinda foodgasmic.  Peter, our server, was very friendly and attentive.  A few days later, dreaming about those oysters, I had to come back and this time, we brought my brother and another friend.  We ordered the last 6 oysters, green bean tempura and popovers... I saw the eyebolios of my bro and friend disappear into the back of their heads every time they had a bite.    I will be back in October, and I will bring more of my people here!!!! Mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm!!!",

We were looking for a place to have dinner in the area with some vegetarian options and we decided on this place after checking out their menu. They also accept reservations, which was a plus. It's a small restaurant, with an appealingly understated (for Vegas) and modern decor. We started out with some great cocktails: My friend had the Hogwash, possibly the cutest cocktail ever! It came in a little tub with a rubber pig in it. The hubby had the Whiskey Went Coco, which was on the sweeter side. I forget the name of my cocktail, but it was basically the filthiest martini ever--I loved it! We also shared the Kickin' Green Bean Tempura appetizer, before moving on to Mama's Marvelous Vegetarian Meatballs for me and Vegan Burger for the hubby. The meatballs were especially great; they came on red-skinned mashed potatoes covered in a rich onion gravy--I definitely didn't miss the meat there. I think the hubby said his vegan burger was just OK, though. The service was also great. Can't really find any fault with our time here, I'd love to come back again!",

    "text": "My gf and I were really hungry and we decided to eat at this location again because the pretzel was so good before.   The pretzel on this trip was even better. The glazed hot butter made the pretzel so decadent and perfect in texture. The sauces were even better, the sweet honey mustard and the beer cheese sauce were both good.  For our entree, we got the Chicken BLTA and the Cubano. Chicken BLTA was so good. There was a nice creaminess from the sauce and the chicken breast was cooked with a nice crisp. The avocado in this dish reminded me of the LA style freshness, taking me back home. I would recommend this dish was anyone.  The cubano got some reprimand from me in my previous review because the pickle hardened the melted cheese in the middle. But this time, the pickle was placed next to the meat and separated from the cheese so it felt like a perfectly cooked mozarella stick.   Before I end the review, I want to give major props to our waiter. He was a great guy and made a couple potentially-hangry guests really happy both in service and speed. Thanks CJ!!!   This place deserves 5 stars for the quality of service and food. However, what I'm most impressed about this restaurant is the adaptive nature of their cooking and care. These guys really CARE about their restaurant and that in itself warrants a 5 star review.   The only downside of the meal was the french fries. It was cooked well but drenched in oil likely due to a low temperature in the fryer. But I don't eat fries recently and the yelp check-in offer had some mind-blowing tempura green beans, which is probably the best yelp check-in I have ever used.",

Our servers were delightful, great personalities, but seemed spread thin and service was spotty. Items came out randomly, weird timing, my friend's one salad was so salty that he couldn't eat it, he sent it back, my other friend's drink was pretty bad, and my third friend had his dinner dropped all over the table when it was delivered (accidents happen), so had to wait for his second dinner to arrive when we were all done.  Just okay food, very well-intentioned and stressed-out servers who were, again, VERY nice to us, but the experience was just a bit messy. Not as messy as the five (literally) people we saw arrested just outside of the restaurant over our 90 minute dinner, but messy. Probably wouldn't return. There are other options where things would likely go a lot smoother.",

I wanna say it's handmade and not just a freezer boca patty. It almost taste like a meat burger. Veggies were fresh on top and bun was crispy. I also ordered the fried deviled eggs, I liked them but they needed a little salt. Beer selection is awesome. I suggest the local CraftHaus brewery saison.",

So I thought this was a great opportunity to check it out.   This place is basically set up, food wise, as an English pub. Bangers and mash, fish and chips, etc. It's a blend of new school w/ that English pub food feel. It's a small place w/ a bar up front that seats about 8 people and a few table tops, w/ several tables located towards the back of the house. The kitchen is open to see what's being made and what's coming out. You're in the thick of it in the back of the house as you can see the flames rise high during certain cooking of items.   I ordered the fish and chips. OMG! Three large pieces of plated on top of a set of fries. The fish is SO crispy and tasty! The fries, they don't have much flavor. BUT if you've been to England, you know there's not much flavor added to them. This was so much that I had to get a to go box.   My friends got four apps: Artichoke Deviled eggs - said they were very bland Bacon wrapped jalapenos  Tuna Poke  Between the two of them they said they could've done w/ more food after killing those apps.   If you're near downtown and you're craving some pub like food this is where you should come. Ask for Nat, she'll take care of you. She made our first visit a great experience! Cheers!",

It was just what my stomach wanted. I recommend checking in on Yelp as you may get a free appetizer offer. Wait staff were super friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. The general vibe is relaxed. I imagine their pork options are a must try too but unfortunately I eat little pork and cannot comment on them! Highly recommend venturing down Fremont to this place and expand your palate, try different things, hey when in Vegas right?",

My wife and I split the burger (as did the couple we were with).  All I can say is that it was nearly inedible.  The meat had an off -somewhat sour- flavor.  It was pretty disappointing to say the least.  We actually went to a sandwich shop on the way back to our hotel as we still needed to eat.",

Hard boiled eggs covered in Panko crumbs, deep fried to crispy perfection and topped with a delicious spicy egg yolk filling. YUM! The ginger dressing on the house salad provided a delightfully fresh flavor sensation. The fish and chips were crispy and juicy. The bangers and mash were bland. To finish off our meal, we shared a Sticky Toffee Pudding - a hot, sweet cake covered in warm toffee sauce and real whipped cream. A perfect ending to a lovely meal.",

    "text": "To preface, I honestly think many of the Downtown/Fremont area restaurants are overrated. I'm not sure if it's that people's expectations are set low due to the area, or maybe they're used to over priced strip fare, and the semi-reasonable prices increase the ratings.  This was our second visit here (we live nearby), so the rating is effectively a combination of the two visits. To start, they have a pretty limited, and very uninspired menu. Fish & Chips, Shepherds Pie, Salmon, Burger - I believe there's about 6-7 entree options overall. Pricing is a bit high for what you get, even considering it is in a tourist area. The burger is relatively (compared to similar places) small, and bland. The shepherds pie is strangely dry and greasy at the same time (not sure how they pull that off - on a side note, if you are really in the mood for shepherd's pie, Tod English Pub has one of the best around). Fish & Chips are pretty standard - not great, but not bad either.  The strongest area in my opinion is their overall draft beer selection. For only having 6 taps, the selection is very well rounded, and offers something for everyone.  However what truly inspired me to write this review was the service (or lack of) we faced last night. Certainly having your food take forever is forgivable - it happens now and then - but when both the server and who I assume was either the owner or manager (he had a british accent) outright lie about losing your ticket and try playing it off as if nothing happened, then intentionally avoid you until the meal is essentially over is absolutely something that is not.  We noticed that about 30 minutes after ordering that the table next to us (who came and ordered about 10-15 minutes after us) had already received their food - two of the items were what our table had also ordered. It was another 5 minutes or so until the server came by and we asked about our order (it's odd that she wasn't concerned to begin with - I was in the restaurant business and that would have been something I would have caught instantly). She insisted that our \"ticket was still up there and it would be ready any minute\" - Well another 15 minutes later, and essentially after every other table in the restaurant had received their order, we were finally served. What was maddening is that they hadn't even started our food (our table was right next to their kitchen) for a good 10-15 minutes AFTER the server indicated she had already checked on our ticket and that there was no need for concern.  To make matters worse, the owner or manager was the one expediting and delivering the food. Did he make any attempt to make amends for the screw up? Absolutely not. Nor did the server - in fact, they simply stuck their heads in the sand and preferred to think it never happened.  Anyways, when you add everything together - Uninspired food, crappy service and ignorant management/ownership, we certainly won't be back.",

The ribs were so fall-of-the bone tender, we could cut with a butter knife. This is definitely a dinner for two, but so filling and tasty. Everything down to the lettuce was spot on. For dessert, the sticky toffee. Delicious dessert made from dates and home made whip! Perfect way to end the dinner. Brandon was an awesome waiter and suggested the best of the best here. Loved everything, from service to quality of food.",

We came here on a Thursday night around 6:30pm and it was a little busy but we were able to be seated within 5mins since it was just the 2 of us! It's kinda small but holds alot of people.  Okay so First off the cocktails are amazing!! I got the Hoo has the Thyme cocktail(bourbon drink) and man was it delicious! It had a mix of orange syrup in it as well, they make it themselves!! I also ordered the Fish and chips and it literally melted in your Mouth!  super delicious!  I would definitely recommend this place because not only the food and drinks are delicious but the staff is very friendly and recommended the best options!",

    "text": "About 5 months ago, after our second time in this place, I gave it a great review. I'm changing my review to a 1 Star after the despicable treatment by the bartender/server (allegedly a relative of the owner).  This time my wife and I brought in 2 other couples. It was a Saturday Evening around 8:00 PM. The place was busy, but still had seats at the bar. It took 10 minutes for the bartender even to acknowledge us, even though we were only 6 feet away (the bar is not that big).  It took another 10 minutes to take our drink order. We were patient and in a good mood. It took 5 more minutes to get a seat. By then, half the place had emptied out. Our orders were timely taken but the food came out slow. Nonetheless, the food was good and our table was happy and chatting. Near the time we were finishing our plates, the bar tender was carrying a bin of glasses from the bar to the back. I guess it was a semi-tight squeeze behind my chair.  I can't help it where they sat us.  I was sitting like normal, pulled up to the table as I was still eating.  The BT bumped a picture on the wall with the container she was carrying and the picture swiveled but didn't fall. She got mad about hitting it and SLAMMED her container to the ground. I jumped from the noise that surprised me. I thought she dropped it. The ladies with me were aghast, they all said she slammed it intentionally. As we started talking about it, the BT walked by and muttered some expletive about me sitting too far into the isle. I told her I was sorry but didn't realize it and would have tried to shuffle in closer to the table had she just told me.  She rudely dismissed me. Then the other server came over to ask if we needed anything else. We told her, \"yeah, the Manager\". She said she was the manager. The ladies told her the story. By now we were upset.  The BT, from behind the bar says \"I can hear you, you know\". We respond in kind that she can listen all she wants. The BT then came to the table and slammed a glass down on the table with a Big Bang and says \"This one just sat here with his legs all stretched out and spread like he owns the place\" (not True by the way).  After that I can't remember the words that were exchanged.   The Manager finished our service but No apologies, even though she was obviously embarrassed.   All I can say now is \"what * .............\" (I think I'll keep that comment to myself).",

Stop 2, DTLV Daytime Drinking Pub Crawl (It's not my fault the sun sets so late in Summertime Vegas).  Small, uninspired, and disjointed menu.  OK bangers and mash, the bangers have a smooth texture, good spice blend but very mild liver taste.  OK gravy.  Fish and chips also just OK.  Crispy, not too oily with good seasoning, tiny portion.  Chips are the soft and fluffy variety hit with spicy seasoning.  OK mushy peas served room temp.  Not classic but OK.  Sadly, the \"crispy deviled eggs\", a take on the Scotch egg, disappoints.  Breaded, deep fried, and topped with more yolky substance misses the mark.  Oily, cloying, and quickly coats the palate.  The \"Mini Yorkshire puddings\" looked and tasted burnt.  No tender tendrils inside to absorb the gravy, became instantly soggy.  A miss.  Small selection of mostly American craft beer.  Some local's on tap.  Surprisingly week selection of beers from the Isles.  No vintage beers.  OK service.  It's hard to smash a small restaurant that is obviously trying to find a niche.  Sadly, there isn't enough at the Smashed Pig to warrant a return.",

This place is towards the end of the Fremont St. Experience area but is worth the walk.  We were there for lunch and it seems they have an even more expansive dinner menu with more traditional pub type options.  They have a great beer selection and the food we shared, crunchy deviled eggs and a burger, was very good.  Only other thing I would highlight is that this does not look like a traditional English pub when you walk in - it seems very new and clean, but they have a pretty small bar and then a couple of rooms of tables that seems more like a standard family restaurant than an English pub.  But don't let that stop you from trying this place out!",

The ruby was passable, but not as good as Graham's or Fonseca. The gluten free choices for noshes were a little limited.

Drinks were all too sweet in the way amateur mixologists often try to pander to the lowest common denominator. The food similarly is good, but pedestrian. Lots of frying and breading overshadows really great flavors hiding beneath the breadcrumbs. English food isn't all that entertaining anyway, so sympathetic to the fact that they don't have much to go on. Overall, decent place to put food in the belly, but if you are looking to eat something really good, there are much better places close by.",

The lamb is a perfect pair with all the flavors. The fried deviled eggs take a classic and make it more sinful. Fish and chips are the perfect batter to fish ratio for an airy bite of pub flavor. Worth the stop and a short walk across the street from the gambling halls on Fremont. Take the time to try it.",

My fish and chips came right from the fryer hot, with the lightest crispest batter coating, with house made tartar sauce.

These ain't your regular line cooks, and this ain't just a bar/pub. It's high quality fare.  We came for lunch and had the Sunday Sirloin roast with yorkshire pudding, potatoes, vegetables and gravy. The yorkshire pudding was excellent with the right mix of crunch and fluffiness. The sirloin was medium rare and tender but the potatoes were the star; So crunchy!

From there I moved on to the chicken lettuce wraps, which they already wrapped for me, these were another winner! Hubby started with the crispy deviled eggs, I was intrigued by the name and fell in love with the result. Who knew you could crispy up a boiled egg. My husbands main dish was the fish and chips with a side of mushed peas that have an unexpected flavor of amazing.

I love the variety of menu selections, including the standard fish and chips, yet adding things like lamb tacos and shrimp sliders. I was originally planning to order the bangers and mash, but it's a dinner item so I chose the linguine special. It was $10 and came with a side salad. My friend ordered the shrimp sliders, and we got the crispy deviled eggs as a starter. The staff was very friendly, no snobbery going on here! The food was fantastic! Fan-fkn-tastic even. My pasta was so perfectly cooked, I'm pretty sure they made the pasta in-house. It was delicate yet sturdy, with the bacon adding a sweet smoky flavor while the French beans provided a tart crunch. It was perfectly executed. The crispy deviled eggs surprised me because I was assuming they would've had sausage on them like a scotch egg. There was no sausage but I'm not complaining. The bottom portion of the egg (white part) was breaded and fried, yet there was no trace of greasy residue, just a tasty crispy crust. The tiny little pickles on top were small yet packed with flavor. I am definitely going back soon!!",

Coke products, Yay! But we had to ask for refills. Great dinner!",

My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the burger. We split our portions and we both liked both dishes. The fish in particular was quite crisp and not at all greasy. The fries that came with both were hot and tasty. The only thing that really fell flat was the \"smashed peas\" that came with the fish. They really didn't have much flavor at all. We also had draft beers and got some very nice recommendations. All in all very small menu but very tasty. Next time you're downtown, worth a try!",

Our table had the cheese and cold cut board, lettuce wraps, and tempura green beans for our app.  All was incredible!  For our entree our party had the butcher block (nightly special for 2), banger & mash, and the NY strip steak. The bangers & mash were the best I have ever had!  The NY strip disappeared from my colleagues plate...he kept holding up a piece saying \"this is cooked perfectly\".  The pork special for the night, tenderloin with mashed potatoes, salad, and veggies was equally excellent.  I got to sample all and when my colleagues were stuffed and everything was prepared perfectly.  We ended the dinner extravaganza with the sticky toffee pudding....wow!  And only $5??  Skip the 99 cent shrimp cocktail outside and get the sticky pudding! Our total for dinner was a little over $50 per person for beers, apps, dinner, and a sampling of dessert.  Was worth twice the price!  We ate at Gilda's the previous night for much, much more, that was good, but not near the level of Smashed Pig.  Everything was cooked and service with the love of food.  I'd recommend eating here to anyone that enjoys great food and wants a getaway from the neon on the strip or cheap prime rib in Fremont.  Will be back again!",

When you have a place you can see into the kitchen and that they weren't even making the food yet is an issue. Our server tried to make up for the delay with beers... 2 of us weren't drinking. The DJ was great. If your looking for a quick bit this isn't the place to come.",

Firstly the positive aspects of my experience were the service was good and the drinks were ok. But I ordered a pub burger and there were fries in it (or something that looked like fries) that were rock hard. Like fries that had been left out for a long time and had dried up, hardened, and become stale. If I had bitten my burger a little harder and less carefully I probably would have hurt my teeth. It was really gross and pretty much ruined the meal for me. My boyfriend's food wasn't much better as he thought the impossible burger he ordered left him with a bad aftertaste... he said it reminded him of the smell of cat food. We both left wondering if we were going to get food poisoning, that's how gross everything was. All in all, not coming to this restaurant ever again. And considering our experience, are suprised by the mostly positive reviews on here.. maybe it was just some bad menu choices on our part.",

    "text": "My wife and I recently discovered The Smashed Pig while visiting Fremont Street and are extremely happy we did! In short, great food, excellent service and cool decor. We arrived shortly before 6:30 on a Saturday night and surprised there was no real wait to get a table, but by the time we left, most tables were seated.  As previously stated, the service was excellent and our server, Jazzlyn, was superb. We couldn't decide on what to order so we asked her to make some recommendations.  She suggested the Yum Yum Shrimp and the pressed Cubano.  We were not disappointed!  She also recommended a couple of locally brewed beers and provided us a sample of her two favorites.  I ordered Astronomy Alework's - Pluto is a Planet IPA and my wife had the Lovelylady Paleo Porter. We enjoyed our beers as much as the food.   We visit Vegas regularly and The Smashed Pig will become one of our regular stops.  We definitely recommend you stop by and try this place out.",

My group shared a bunch of their apps, including the deviled eggs, cheese plate, lamb tacos, salad, and one other item (i forget - we also had some drinks :)).  Everything was delicious and so reasonably priced!  The interior is small, but clean, and has an ambiance that you may see in a restaurant in Brooklyn.",

    "text": "The Smashed Pig is a traditional English gastropub with a rotating seasonal menu. Wines, Craft beers, cocktails, and fresh food from scratch, you cant really go wrong.  I had the Crispy Shrimp Salad: avocado, orange segments, cucumber, chipotle mayo, citrus dressing. Really great complimenting flavors, the shrimp was crunch and a little sweet. I tried my husbands Fish and Chips... I'm going to put these in the top 3 best fish and chips I've ever had. Nice and crunchy bear batter, flaky, fall apart on the inside. Seriously perfect. This is a bit of a smaller restraraunt and kitchen, but we got here at 8pm on a Saturday night and only waited about 15 minutes. It's a pretty simple set up, open, sleek clean walls, simple wooden tables but still sleek looking with their fun lighting fixtures and clean look all the way around. So glad to have found another great place to grub on the Old Strip.",

We ordered a variety of entrees including the cheese burger, salmon, tuna, and bangers and mash. Excellent! The waitstaff was attentive and friendly.",

Pretzel was bigger than our heads. The sales was incredible sadly. It said baby greens but was just a pile of arugula. The pears were supposed to be red wine poached but weren't.

    "text": "Oh, man. This was a weird experience. The PLUS, first: The waitress we had was AMAZING. So sweet, kind, and accommodating. She made this a 3-star review instead of a 2- or 1-star review.   THE MINUSES:   1. The food: It was o-kay. Not amazing as I expect a \"Gastropub\" would be. If it were just a \"pub,\" now that would be one thing, and that would be fine. But when you put the adjective \"gastro\" in front of \"pub,\" we are expecting something a little more than the ordinary. And beyond the ordinary is in terms of flavor, execution, and presentation...not just the clever and the \"out of the box.\"   The flavor and execution on the chicken lettuce wraps I ordered were just not there. The chicken was really, really salty. I would have sent it back but I was not going to make my guest feel uncomfortable. But really, it was nearly inedible. I really felt as though I had dined at the ocean's floor, and I worried about my blood pressure.  The presentation was also very uninspired. Just cups of lettuce with chicken inside. That does not bother me, except the chef or whomever decided to be extra clever and put it on a wooden cutting board. (?!)  But why in the world would you need to serve chicken lettuce wraps on a CUTTING BOARD? There is nothing that needs cutting.  It is not a cheese course, either. Bizarre.  The deep fried devil's eggs were delicious. No doubt about that. (Also contributing to the restaurant's relatively high score for me). But they are a bit stingy with the order. I'd prefer to pay more and get more of them in an order, or allow for a large or small appetizer option.  (On the negative, it is still not presented very well. As I recall, the eggs are kind of lumped on the plate).  2. The atmosphere/and other elements: Aside from our awesome waitress, the guy who brought our food and drinks was really weird. He was all over us, serving from the right and left, and just ham-fisted with everything. He also seemed surly and disgruntled. He was apparently annoyed with us just for being there. It was not a good look. Oh, well.  The atmosphere is not bad. It's a bit noisy, and not conducive to a conversation. It is a little touristy, so not a good \"power lunch\" spot for locals. It's hard to say what category it should fall in.  I don't hate it, but I would not return.",

With the first group, he politely seated them, then sort of gestured for us to sit somewhere. We were so confused because it was not a seat yourself kind of establishment. My husband asked him where he wanted us to sit? The worker displayed a negative attitude. I even caught him rolling his eyes. At that point, I was ready to grab my purse and leave. My generally mild-mannered husband was appalled and confronted the guy. No one deserves to be treated like that.  Our server discreetly asked us what transpired and we shared. She was a real gem. The manager came to our table to apologize and I believe they sent the other worker home. The atmosphere of the entire restaurant changed in an instant. One rotten apple can truly spoil the whole bunch.  After reading numerous articles that highlighted their Fluffy Pancake with Apples - I knew I had to have it. My pancake appeared to be a little overcooked, so the texture was tough. The taste was not bad, but I'd try something else next time. My husband ordered the PB & J French Toast and loved it!   The owner suggested that we come back and try their dinner menu. They only use seasonal ingredients and the chef is very innovative. We will definitely give them another shot.",

My friend Justin G. and I ordered 2 of everything offered on the food menu for Happy Hour. So we each got only two things - either the menu should be expanded or don't even bother offering Happy Hour. I'm not a big drinker and Justin was on antibiotics, so he couldn't drink.   Mac & cheese bites - 2/$1. While piping hot, these tasted like nothing. They were served with a side of ketchup. That's too Canadian for me.  Pork sliders - 1/$2. Pieces of pork on a bun with a pickle. I'm not a fan of pickles, but I didn't bother to remove it, because again, it had no taste. It's like eating with a stuffed nose (which I didn't have.) You can feel the mouth texture, but taste nothing.   The fact you're going to have to pay to park / pay for ride share to eat here makes me a little harsher for this review. If I'm paying to park, then all the food has to be worth the extra hassle and cost. From what I had, this place doesn't warrant a repeat visit.",

You can tell chef cares about the recipes as the menu is small but well thought out in it's variety.  I will say some of their cocktail recipes seemed a little over kill for a gastro pub and would like to see some local beer options.  I would definitely go back and recommend others give it a shot.",

    "text": "\"Miffed\" is an understatement...  I absolutely love the new additions to DTLV and was pretty stoked to dine in with my friend this evening.   After about a five minute wait staring at a baby at the bar a polite gentleman directed me to my table.   If this review was based solely on food hands down Smashed Pig deserves all five stars. Regrettably, the unsatisfactory service I received from the same gentleman that directed me to my table was UNACCEPTABLE.   In the middle of dinner a gentleman (who appears to be an owner/manager) came to my table and picked up the last bread slice in my cheese platter with his fingers and sat the bread on another platter before removing a dish from the table. I still can't comprehend why anyone would do that especially without permission. I didn't say anything because I honestly don't think it would have mattered. You be judge! UNACCEPTABLE   What I ordered:  *Spicy Crispy Shrimp was fried to perfection and I enjoyed every bite  *Deviled Eggs- the filling was very flavorful but I wasn't a fan of the fried egg white  *French Bean Tempura- MUST ORDER these were amazing and the chipotle mayo was a great addition  *Sashimi Tartare- delish!   *Yorkshire Pop-overs  *Infamous Cheese Plate- The jig jams is so good great flavor  *Sticky Toffee Pudding- great flavor highly recommend   *SP Crepes- I wasn't a fan by my friend thought they were great!   Overall I doubt I'd return but the food was great!",

Had an old fashioned, was just happy they didn't use regular ice however sad that may be. Too many places do that so I don't drink at those places anymore haha.  I had ordered the french bean tempura, the lamb tacos, and the sauteed veggie medley. The french bean tempura was interesting. A little heavy but the tempura was crisp and held pretty well throughout the meal. The lamb tacos were decent, a little dry but the sour cream helped with that. I wanted a bit of a sauce to go with it tho, maybe an herb aioli would've done well. The sweet pepper chutney was difficult to incorporate into the food because of the size of the tacos. If they could be bigger that'd be awesome to allow for space but otherwise just gotta take bites of each in order to make it work. The sauteed veggie medley had good flavor but felt a bit small.   Overall, pretty good to come by for some pre party noms. I'd stop by again if in the area.",

    "text": "Great Saturday night dinner suggestion by my husband! We had plans to meet friends downtown, but wanted to grab dinner first. Initially my husband suggested Vic & Anthony's, but they were oddly booked for the night so it was plan B. Plan B was definitely a grade A option.  The decor and ambiance of the dining area was really nice. It was the kind of restaurant that made me happy because it's the direction I want to see downtown heading towards. The dining area was clean with clean lines and modern decor. The kitchen was open so we were able to see the chef preparing the delicious dishes while we dined.  I started with the House Salad to get the ever important vegetables, but ended up loving it. The ginger dressing was so tasty that I had to eat the whole salad. It was similar to the taste of a ginger dressing at a Japanese restaurant, but kicked up a notch to be even better.  My husband and I shared several items since we weren't starving. The Mini Yorkshire Puddings had such great flavor and texture. The gravy was tasty, but not even necessary in my opinion. The Crispy Deviled Eggs were unique in that they are fried. I found them to be yummy. The Bangers and Mash were my favorite dish. The waitress said that the sausage is made in house and this was evident in texture and taste. The mashed potatoes and onion gravy served with the bangers were amazing. All of the flavors were fantastic in this dish.  For dessert the Sticky Toffee Pudding was calling my name. This proved to be a delicious treat just like every other item that evening. The portion was perfect for one and I appreciated that I didn't have to feel like I was overindulging.   Since we were headed out for the night we passed on cocktails, but I'm definitely partaking on my next visit. The Specialty Pigtails sounded good and the drinks on tables around us looked tasty.",

    "text": "Eh....  I'll be honest, this place really didn't do much for me what so ever!  It was a cool spot, I'll give you that. But to call it a *British* gastropub?  I really didn't get the feel of anything British, save for Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin on the radio. Granted, I've never been to England, so I can't exactly say it wasn't like the gastropub's there, but still....  This place doesn't ooze British at all. We ordered 2 cocktails, the gin fizz, and the Cheeky Bugger. Both were.... ok. I'd have much preferred to give my money to the downtown cocktail room. Next, we ordered the fried deviled eggs. They were good, quite good. We then ordered fish and chips, and the shepherds pie. When the guy brought it to the table, he asked which of us had the bangers and mash...........  Yeah... neither one of us. Mind you, he had a plate of fish and chips, and shepherds pie in his hands....  Maybe your staff should know your menu better?  It isn't very large after all.... Anyway... The fish and chips were pretty solid..  The chips being the star of the dish, which is kind of sad, the batter on the fish was a bit under cooked. The smashed peas were anything but.. you literally get a shot glass size of peas, and they were not even close to cooked all the way, very disappointing....        Now, the shepherds pie, my god could this have been any worse?  Now, I've had my fair share of shepherds pie, and this was so, so sad. It was lacking in gravy, lacking in veggies..  The shreds of carrots were no bigger than a grain of rice. I asked before I ordered what was in the dish, and she said carrots, onions, celery.. etc. I *saw* carrots... and that's it!  The mash on top was decent, but the main focus should be the filling..  The meat was ground so small, it reminded me of wet dog food.  The accompanying salad was decent, but the salad should never overshadow the main dish. I tend to believe another yelper that said the dish is microwaved... Which hurts my heart, especially considering on the front page of their website they have the definition of a gastropub as \"A pub that specializes in serving high quality food.\"  Sooooo, microwaved shepherds pie is high quality?  Or just high priced?  Yeah, seems legit.        So, then comes the bill...  Now, I absolutely have ZERO problem paying good money for good food, and service. But with 2 cocktails, one appetizer, and two entrees... Including an appropriate tip (my wife is a server after all) the total spent was $80. To me.. that's absolutely atrocious!  Yes, I get it, it's Vegas... Trust me, we live here.. We understand that you must pay for good food.. The only problem is, it wasn't good food, not by a long shot... and most certainly wasn't \"high quality food,\" like the definition of gastropub suggests.        I really wanted to like this place... I really did. But I think we'll stick to crown and anchor for those British food cravings.       We really love the new look of downtown, and highly welcome the insurgence of new, and trendy drinks, and food. But this one just misses the mark....         But, I suspect that hoards of people will continue to flock here, and think they're getting super trendy, high quality food because it's served on a carving board. Luckily we're able to see the forest for the trees..         You can't put lipstick on a smashed pig and pass it off as great food. Sorry.... failure.",

He forgot to put in our lamb tacos and we had to remind him. Other than that he came off as a total jerk. He even took my menu from me because I was too \"indecisive\" but let my male counter part keep his .

He seemed knowledgeable, pleasant and interesting. We tried a few of the drinks but I think they tend to lean toward the sweet side. Even the old fashion was too sweet. So the drinks were a miss for me but if you like sweeter drinks it may be great for you! We started with the Yorkshire pudding which was excellent and came with an onion marmalade dipping sauce. Also the tempura green beans were well prepared. The butcher block special was the southern fried chicken. Chicken was juicy and flavorful and crisp! My only complaint was one piece was slightly underdone. The spicy slaw they served was tasty as was the croquets but the cornbread was too dry. Lastly we had the sticky toffee which was flavorful but the presentation underwhelming and it really needs some ice cream to contrast the toffee. That dish has a nice core but needs to be kicked up a notch.",

We were disappointed that we had just had lunch as the menu looked amazing, even the options that I normally wouldn't touch! Despite neither of us being fans of fish, the plate of fish and chips that came delivered to the customers next to us smelled so delicious, both of us would have been tempted to try it.   Alas, we really were still full from our lunch so we stuck to the drink menu and ordered a few of the speciality cocktails. There's a pretty decent selection of drinks plus draught beers and we stayed for about an hour trying a few things and having a good conversation with the bar tender.   The pub wasn't too busy or loud, the staff was attentive and super friendly, and we had a very enjoyable time there. We were so impressed, we're aiming to stay in the area next year for a night and grab at least one meal at the pub and spend a few more hours on drinks. This was definitely our favourite location in the Fremont area that day!",

Round two, was the Yorkshire pudding, light airy bits of bread with a yummy gravy for dipping. Main course split for two was the house made beef bangers and mash. Pretty amazing!

    "text": "Wow wow wow !!!! Was not expecting a gastro pub in downtown Vegas that would be so good !!!! Let's start off with the atmosphere, pretty casual comfortable vibe not sure how long this place has been open but looks pretty new and up to date. The hostess and bartender welcomed us with smiles which is always nice ! You place your order off of the chalkboard up in front and they give you a number. When we came around 230pm it wasn't busy at all which was nice food came out hot quick and fresh !! Everything was sooooooo good !!! Hot wings and dressings on the side which I love because I can't handle too hot of a wing, so being able to get the taste without burning my tongue off was nice ! The sauce had a great flavor and the wings had a perfect crisp as well .  The house salad was a very nice pleasant surprise, it was a pretty good side and the best house salad I ever had ! It came with avocado and a ginger dressing, very tasty. The chicken sliders and fries were my favorite, normally chicken or turkey is pretty dry and bland but these where sooooooo juicy and flavorful, the fries were thick cut, only wish they had a speciality ketchup to go with it. They kept checking in on us to make sure we were good and if we needed anything. They also have a happy hour from 3-6pm which I recommend to come for the craft beer here, it is a pretty good selection of options. I for one recommend the Asylum sooooo delicious !!! I would come here again for sure we live in Los Angeles but worth coming to, while we are out here. One last recommendation would be to offer a sit down menu option so you don't feel rushed or to have photos up front or samples of the food especially for those who normally don't come to places like this and don't know what to Expect maybe a photo frame with a slide of photos ? Not sure but thank you again for the great food and good vibes ! One last thing I noticed that the bar had hooks for the purses which is always a nice touch but I loveeeeeeeed that they had outlets for the guest to sit and charge there devices especially after having a long day walking the strip you and your phone get a chance to recharge lol. Before I left I decided to try the pudding. I had to, I couldn't resist and thank god I did !!! Talk about an orgasm in your mouth soooooo yummy perfect portion size because if you have too much it can be very rich but sooooo good I want more lol",
