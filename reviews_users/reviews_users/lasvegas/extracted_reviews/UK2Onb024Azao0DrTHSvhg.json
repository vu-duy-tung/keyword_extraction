Food came quickly. Food was pretty good. Gyro a little dry but greasy. Feta fries delicious. Pita very good.",

The greens were crunchy, the whole dish was well dressed, and it was surprisingly pretty to look at - but that didn't stop me from diving into my bowl of salad awesomeness.   Continuing the trend of large, tasty food; the Traditional Gyro Pita was great: warm throughout, with a great balance of meat, veggies, and sauce. Happy customer!

She gave great recommendations, asked about our kids' likes and dislikes and made sure that we were completely satisfied with our meals. The food was so good. The portions are HUGE which sometimes means that the quality isn't as good, but that isn't the case here. The food is cooked to perfection - the feta, garlic fries are ridiculously good, but if you're looking for more classic dishes, the kabobs and gyro's will not disappoint. Bottom line, if you're looking for excellent food and even better service, head here.   You won't be sorry.",

The gyro sandwich--not much to write home about. The only plus to my meal was the garlic feta fries. Don't know if it was the fries or the gyro but my stomach was doing tail spins (and not in a good way) after I ate. I was excited to try based on the reviews but in all fairness was NOT impressed. Won't be back.",

I will order take out, but will not dine in again because I feel it is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE to not provide a bathroom for the patrons.  Both my friend and I experienced quite an unpleasant episode where we had to run around to find a restroom.  I am guessing this must be a health department violation and it needs to get fixed.  It made our experience stressful and much less enjoyable.    2 stars for now... once they provide restroom(s), 3.5-4 stars.",

Everything was fresh made and you could taste it too    Down side is they don't have fountain drinks so they sell cans of soda and water and no public bathroom (you can go to Del Taco across the way).  Even with that I will definitely recommend to family and friends. The food definitely rates 5 stars.",

If I as to give any constructive feedback this time, it would be to speak with the landlord to change the entry handle, as the towel placed over it is sort of odd/gross (but makes sense because the sun makes it so hot). Also, put a sign out front with pictures of the dishes (and maybe a few in the window advertising your gyros and your \"special\" garlic feta fries!

The food was always delicious and quality consistent. The owner is so friendly. He will wander the restaurant checking on his patrons. Food is served fairly quickly. The decor is very home style Greek. It's not the Parthenon inside, but you can tell a family decorated it.  My fave starter items are the Greek Fries and the Spinach Spring Rolls. They are absolutely delicious and crispy. The fries are fantastic alone, add feta, garlic, and dressing....WOW. The spring rolls are such an awesome idea. They taste amazing. Cheese and spinach! My fave entree the Gyro Wrap. It is flavorful and True to my cravings for authentic gyro. I have made this my goto Greek Restaurant for my cravings.",

They use high quality ingredients and both their chicken kabob and gyro meet are delicious.  The long grained rice is a nice complement and very tasty.  The salads are also fresh.  Prices on the combo platters that include rice, pita and a decent sized salad are very reasonable.  Their homemade baklava is excellent.",

I will try again and hope next time it will be 5 stars.  No more falafel though...",

I've wanted to find a different spot that's closer to my house that remotely compares but every other place is just pure disappointment after I've fallen in love with yannis!   Chicken shawarma plate is my absolute favorite. Chicken smells and tastes amazing. Salad is nice and fresh!! Baklava is made by the owners grandma! Super delicious, flakey, and moist!   Legit BEST MEDITERRANEAN FOOD I've EVER had. Even the owners are personable. That remember you personally. Definitely a nice touch.",

    "text": "I will be the first to admit, this place does look kind of shaky on the outside lol, but the taste of the food and the service was great.   Oddly enough, this wasn't my first option for food when I came to this strip mall. I was supposed to be going to Capriottis for a sandwich, but they didn't really have any great vegan options. Then I walked over to Del Taco because I was going to settle on a bean and cheese burrito (no cheese) and a bean tostada. But then I thought, I eat Del Taco all the time, this can wait.   Yanni's it was. I pulled out my phone real quick and came right to yelp. The overall rating was solid, so I decided to ignore my first impression of the outside and give it a legit shot.   The inside isn't anything out of Mykonos or Santorini, so don't get your hopes up (LOL). But the fact that people were sitting and eating, as well as the phone/pick up orders kept coming in, I knew this place was doing something right.   This was traditional greek food, but everything in their falafel wrap along with their fries were vegan, so I went with that. The flavor was amazing, if I had time and space in my stomach I would have ordered another, and that was just the wrap. The fries may be the best thing on their menu. I'm talking top 5 all time on my fry list.   Sidenote: The gentleman helping me even got it out quickly for me since I told him I was in a rush (BONUS POINTS).  When in vegas, DO NOT overlook this hidden gym. Check them out!",

Then i saw this place, and thought to myself, \"hmm, a greek salad would sure be healthier\" so i decided to Yanni's on a whim.  While entering, i noticed there were a few people in line ordering for take out so I could tell this was a trendy/popular spot.  I was greeted by a middle aged woman with a smile.  She helped me decide what to order, which was a filet minion kabob with a salad no onions and no olives, and i told her I wanted to have an ample amount of lettuce on my salad.  My order came in less than 10 minutes, super fast, hot delicious meat on a beautiful thick salad with 3-4 tomatoes and lots of feta.  Also came with a dressing and yogurt sauce.  I gulped every bite.  And felt very satisfied after.  I think I have a new favorite Greek Spot now!! Used to only trust going to Yassou's greek grill but now they have a tough competitor... this place is great!! Super affordable too..  I was impressed by a huge salad and 12 oz of Filet Minion on kabobs for less than $20 after tax!!  Woohoo Ill be coming back for sure.",

Second of all, we ordered a lamb gyro, garlic feta fries, spanikopita, stuffed grape leaves, some other kind of kopita I cannot remember, and baklava.  Everything came out prompt, and the food was incredible. The garlic feta fries were out of this world. The lamb in the gyro was moist and tender. The spanikopita and \"other\" kopita were crispy, hot, cheesy, and delicious. My husband was very suspicious of the stuffed grape leaves, but ended up loving them. The texture can be a bit off-putting if you don't know what to expect, but they were doused with lemon-y goodness and went well with the fried portion of our meal, as a nice offset.  The baklava was covered in sticky, honey goodness.  Next time I'm craving Greek, we'll be back.  The ONLY downside is that it is 40 minutes away on the other side of town!",

    "text": "Stopped in today after watching a show last night where someone was having a gyro.  So i yelp gyro to find the closest one.  Lucky for me it was yannis.  I have been to the middle east so i am familiar with their style of kabob and shawarma.   But this was my first \"real\" gyro.  I think i had one back in the 90s when all the fast food places were making their version.  So lets dive into the food.  The portion was perfect.  Hungry guys every where should be happy.  I probably could have only had half but in the spirit of yelp i had to ensure that the last bite was as good as the first.  I ordered the traditional gyro combo woth garlic feta fries.  First bite was a fry.  DELICIOUS.  Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  They were garlicy but why order garlic fries if thats not what you're into.  It also had some sort of fry sauce lightly drizzled on it.  Not sure what it was but neither added or detracted from the fries as a whole.  I think the buffalo sauce that they removed from previous reviews would have been okay on the3 side.l but they were good as is. The gyro was super good.  None of the individual ingredients tried to take the lead but together it was bliss.  I did try the meat by itself.  Great flavor and some of the pieces were crispy and some had more chew.  It was great.  For dessert i had some baklava.   I mran it was sitting there all by itself on the counter and needed me to save it from its plexiglass prison.  It tasted like all baklava ive had before.  Sweet cinnamon and yummy.  The staff was also very friendly.  The guy at the register was very nice.",

Moving right along, the whole reason I went is because I'm obsessed with chicken lemon rice soup and went there just to order this. I get to the counter and place my order but they have run out :( I'm disappointed. It's only like 4pm.    So I order a Greek salad and a shawarma plate. Very salty. Everything was so salty. And I love salt! I usually add it to everything. Maybe an off day? Who knows? I haven't been back since nor do I plan on it.   Owner was nice and very apologetic about the soup situation which is why they got 2 stars.",

What we got instead was an amazing food experience. I had the chicken gyro and the rest of my party had the regular gyro. We got a mix of the garlic fries and salads as our sides. EVERYTHING was delicious. Best of all was YaYa's (grandma) baklava and as a Greek as well, my other half really knows what he's talking about!  Additionally, our son was ill. They gave him a bowl of rice and a Gatorade and asked several times how he was doing. So kind to go out of their way for him.",

While Stephano's is my usual Greek salad restaurant, I was down south of the strip and thought this might be a nice alternative based on the yelp reviews. When I walked in there was only one other gentleman in the restaurant (about 1:30pm?) This is a real family run restaurant, and it reminded me of my mother taking my order which is fantastic!  They don't really have a grilled chicken kebab salad on the menu so we ordered the grilled chicken kebab lunch with two sides of salad. Take a look at the picture as it was delicious looking and tasting.  Would I go back? Sure you bet! So here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes",

The restaurant decor is minimal, but clean and uncluttered. There are about a dozen tables and a lounge area. The restroom was also very clean. The service was great and our waitress was very attentive. She checked on us often and had our food and drink out to us quickly.  I ordered the Gyro Platter and found it to be delicious and filling. The salad was fresh and had a nice dressing on top. The gyro meat was the best I've had. It was moist and well seasoned with a nice crust on the outside. The rice served with the gyro meat was well prepared, but would have been more exciting with some nuts, dried fruit, or herbs.   My husband ordered a Gyro with a side of Feta Fries. He agreed that the gyro meat was some of the best he's ever had with the crust being the best part. The Feta Fries were delicious! The fresh feta really made the flavor and the sauce drizzled on top was delicious with the crispy fries.",

The babaganosh is some of the worse I have had, but the hummus isn't bad, it isn't amazing either. The meat was really dry and looked like weird thick deli meat. So, that wrapped in a pita sponge with some lettuce and tomatoes, very disappointing. The staff is always super pleasant and nice. I would say two stars, but the fact that they do not have tabbouleh salad vs yet another lettuce salad, kills it for me.",

I really wanted to give it another try.  Let me tell you!!! It was not a disappointment.  The lady that served us was kind and patient with us.  Bring it was out first time trying this type of food she took the time to answer all of our curious questions.  She even brought out a sample of lamb for us to taste before we ordered!  We ate all the samples lol and ordered.  I got the combo which came with a side.  I got the gyro shawarma and my side was the feta fries.  The fries was soooooo goooooooddd enztra crispy and the sauce and cheese really gave it that extra deliciousness.  My gyro was huge! I was full not even halfway through but it was so good i kept eating lol.  Definitely coming back!!!",

The feta fries could be improved on, I think the Great Greek has them beat on the feta fries. And unfortunately they don't have the avgolemono soup on the menu. But still, this place rocks",

Don't judge a book by it's cover, and just dive in. At Yanni's its damn worth it.  I was driving into Vegas, and needed a quick snack before a dinner that was later in the day. Came across this place on Yelp, and knew I had to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.  We ordered just two plates to share: The garlic feta fries and the chicken kabob plate.  Garlic Feta Fries - Fried to perfection and topped with a generous portion of feta along with a garlic sauce. Such a great bite after a long day of driving.  Chicken Kabob Plate - Comes with a good-sized Greek salad that's as bright as it is refreshing. \"Clean eating\" is what comes to mind. The plate comes with two skewers on top of rice and a side of tangy yogurt sauce. Great flavor on the chicken, and with the yogurt it was very good.  All I can say is that even though I came for a \"light\" snack, this was a great meal. I was surprised at how large the portions were, and left stuffed. Service was great. It seems like they have a lot of regulars!",

    "text": "YYYYYAAAAAAAAANNI  This review should begin with 5 stars...  When I was a little person, I used to love Greek night. Dad would break out the frying pan and get busy on some Gyro and the smell would fill the air and appetite or not, I immediately found a hunger. And every time I had it, I was fat and happy.  But I didn't know what good Gyro was until I found this hidden gem. Kitty corner from the South Point casino you can find a Gyro as big as a football and loaded with flavors that taste like they were pulled from Mother Nature herself. The meat is like bacon on steroids and seasoned with just enough spice to compliment the tzatziki sauce. Fresh lettuce and ripe tomatoes fill out the remainder of the pita.  When I sat down, I was only slightly hungry, I had only planned on eating half. I was three bites in when I realized only an idiot wouldn't finish it.  It may be a little further than your other places, but no matter the distance, it's worth the trip.  Eat up!   Ps-it only lost the last star cause the decor isn't completed yet (although when it does, it's going to be very inviting and filled with beautiful art. Pps-I may be a stick in the mud, but when I tried to go compliment the cooking, no one was around to hear. Service industry, someone always has to be listening.  ***but don't let my assholeness get in the way of what I promise will be at the top of your 'best things I've ever eaten'",

Working the hours that we do, there are some nights where my roommate and I just want to lay on the couch and order in, and pizza every time just isn't an option. So, we stumbled upon Yanni's and they did not disappoint! The Greek salad is pretty standard but delicious nonetheless. All the pitas I have tried are superior to most Greek places I've been: they're very big and the meat is high quality. My personal fave is the garlic feta fries which are AMAZING; a must try. Delivery is extremely quick (sometimes 15 minutes) and the food never disappoints; two simple reasons for my repeat business.",

It's hole in the wall feel is charming and makes you feel at home and that you know it is going to be authentic Greek food! All orders come with fresh, warm pita bread that I could've ate by itself. The dolmades are huge and stick together when you bite into them which is rare! Comes with taziki for dipping, but they're so flavorful you don't even need it! The Greek salad was simple but delicious. Their portions are huge too. The chicken shawarma came with a sauce.. I have no idea what it was but it made the dish even more delicious than it was. This might be my new Greek spot!",

This location is the tiniest one I've been to so, the best thing to do is to call for a to-go order.  Chicken Gyro: Chicken, tzatziki, onions and tomatoes. The pita is warm and fluffy. The chicken is not dry. 4/5  Beef/Lamb Gyro: Beef/lamb, tzatziki, onions and tomatoes. 4/5  Garlic Feta Fries: They have my favorite Greek fries in town. Garlicky, flavorful, tangy yet creamy feta on top of crispy fried potatoes.  You could give me a bucket of these fries and tell me that's all I can eat all day and I'll be more than happy. Yuuuuummm!!!  5/5  Baklava: It's average. I rarely order baklava from here because I'd rather spend my calories on their fries. 3/5  I'm a creature of habit. So, I always get my gyro, fries + black tea combo everytime I come here and life is good.",

I saw Yanni's on yelp a few weeks after it opened and so far all the reviews were excellent.  They were not busy when we stopped in. The owner himself waited on us. He was a pleasant guy, said he'd been in the business something like 35 years. The other staff were quite friendly as well, chatting with us as they prepared the food. My husband is a gyro fan and he was very pleased with the quality, taste and portion size. Myself, I go for the lamb souvlaki.  It was perfectly cooked - not too over done and dried out as I've had a lot of places do. Portions size was good as well and their tzatziki sauce is delicious. Definitely our new favorite greek restaurant! We will be back - many times!",

We ordered the traditional gyro plate that comes with rice pilaf and salad and wow was it good. My husband had to pick out all the cucumbers because he hates them but other then that it was perfect. They give you a pita on the side and next time I will make sure to order a second one because it was a little small for all the food they give you. They have a small sitting area so it is def a much more of a take out kinda spot which is fine with us. Can't wait to go back already!!",

Unfortunately we have ordered for the last time.  Yanni's has started to use Uber eats. We ordered a large order through the app. And requested a few substitutions-as we have numerous times in the past without issue.  This time, some of the orders had correct subs and some of them were disregarded all together.  No one from our party was exceptionally please. Some mentioned it was \"ok\" but not anything special. Not what we had become accustomed to. Some of the comments were that the gyro meat was dry and on the salty side. The greens in the salads were wilted. The tzatziki sauce was runny. The hummus had an off, somewhat acidic flavor  Our office is a little more than one mile down the same street from the restaurant and yet delivery took almost an hour and a half. The Uber delivery driver said the restaurant had sent their apologies in the delivery time and said they got behind on orders. This would have been understandable and an explanation for the previously mentioned issues. I could have chalked it up to a \"one off\" experience.  Unfortunately, the dagger came while I was picking out the onions (I had specifically requested none) from my salad. I found a nice dead fly staring back at me. Unknown if anymore were present as I tossed the meal after taking this picture",

It tastes like garbage.  The falafel is dry and salty. It tastes like a pound of salt was added. When I complained to the owner she admitted that it is not made fresh it comes from a premixed mix. Why not make falafel fresh like other Greek Restaurants?  1) Its too hard  2) we are short handed Excuses for serving garbage store brought salty mixes?   My teenager could have made a better Greek meal. Stay away from this gross restaurant if you are smart. THE WORST GREEK FOOD OF MY LIFE. Don't make the same mistake I did. Choose any other Greek restaurant in Vegas. The other ones serve fresh Greek food.",

Their recipes are full of flavor and the spices on their meat is amazing!  1. Falafels - crispy on the outside hot and soft on the inside. The falafels are vote sized and easier to eat than other locations - and also cooked evenly unlike other locations  2. Gyro - lamb and beef cubes tender and seasoned bursting with flavor. Hands down my favorite dish.  3. service - very friendly. The lady at front counter is accommodating and very nice when I messed up my own order by accident.",

I also ordered a side of babaghanoush, which was delicious  (although I wish they had given us a larger portion for $4.50...at least filled up the container!) I did order one extra order of pita bread for the babaghanoush and an extra tzatziki sauce, because I like lots of sauce! I had Uber Eats deliver it and everything was hot and fresh when it arrived.

The gyros are SO big, like, I can never finish one. And I'm eating for two so that's saying something. Their feta fries are things dreams are made of and everything is fresh, authentic, and so delicious. I live 3 minutes walking distance but I'd be happy to drive an hour to eat here.

    "text": "This was a great/random find during the last leg of our drive from LA to Vegas. Restaurant has plenty of seating and good AC (important when it was 100+ degrees outside). There was some confusion when we first walked in - we weren't aware they wouldn't take dine-in orders before seating us at a table. Table service was a bit sporadic as they kept forgetting items but they fixed it quickly.   We ordered the chicken kebab plate and garlic feta fries to share and were surprised at how much food it came with. Salad came in a separate bowl and was really well-balanced, with plenty of toppings, and was really crisp and refreshing. Chicken kebab plate came soon after and was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Fries were also perfectly crispy though I wish they had a little bit more sauce. They brought the pita bread after we were nearly done, but it came out warm and fluffy. Both of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.   This will definitely be on my list for my next trip to Vegas! Hoping the service was a little bit better, but nothing to ward me away.",

    "text": "Same owner as the now closed Greek Village Cafe and Yanni's Gyros on Maryland Pkwy (he sold about a year ago, but the new owner kept the name). It's pretty much the same menu as the location on Maryland, I ordered the Gyro Pita again, but this time got the Garlic Feta Fries for my side instead of Hummus & Pita.   The place is small, it's counter service. There are two tables inside and one table outside.  So I had decided to take it to go.   I remembered from my previous visit to Yanni's that I wasn't a huge fan of the tzatziki, it had too much dill for my liking, just my personal preference. The pita was warm and soft, but the gyro meat (a combo of lamb and beef) was a bit dry this time around, and it had a slight discoloration on one side of the meat, like the part that was on the outside of the spit, maybe too long. The garlic fries were pretty good. Guess I'm underwhelmed.",

Love Mediterranean food, so I opted for Yanni's because of its nearby location to my residence, and because I was hungry and did not want to wait long.   I ordered the appetizer falafel balls and the gyro platter.  Serving sizes were more than I expected, that's great.  However, I found the food very salty, that's bad.  Falafel was not fresh and tasty, it was salty.  Salad that came with the platter was fresh, but the meat was salty.  I am trying to eat healthy, and salt is not a healthy choice.  Guess I found Yanni's not worth its salt!",

My dish arrived at the table no more than ten minutes later with a fresh basket of warm pita.  The portion was perfect, the dressing wasn't too heavy and the chicken had the most amazing blend of spices.  This restaurant is on the opposite end of the city for me but I would be more than willing to make a special trip and done here again.  I can't wait to introduce this place to my hubby (we're both foodies) and I'm excited to try everything on the menu.",

There was only one other couple in the restaurant so I don't know why it tiook so long to get service. On our way out a server said he was walking to our table to get our order but at that point it was already too late.   It was a shame because I really wanted to try this place.

I'm a fan of Greek food and love the occasional gyro, especially as it brings back fond memories of the 'Gyro Guy' who ran a stand on the Main Street running through campus town. As a student, we used to get these delicious authentic gyros after a long night at the bars.   Yanni's gyros are better in just about every conceivable way. They were excellent and far better than I expected for a small shopping center restaurant. I mean they were really really good and I ate mine almost an hour after receiving (takeout). I would even say they're better than the few I had in Greece.  I would highly recommend stopping by Yanni's for a the next time you're looking for Greek or something different than the norm. Thanks for the delicious meal guys!",

    "text": "Yanni's Greek Grill is so worth the drive for flavorful Greek cuisine. The restaurant is located on the corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and East Silverado Ranch. You'll see a Shell Gas Station as a landmark, it's in the Silverado Junction plaza and the restaurant is next to a tattoo shop.   I ordered the Chicken Shish Kebob Plate ($12.99) which comes with two skewers of grilled chicken on a bed of Orzo Rice Pilaf and a side of tzatziki sauce. The meal includes a small Greek Salad and Fresh Homemade Pita Bread. For appetizer, I chose Garlic Feta Fries ($3.50) which are seasoned fries topped with feta cheese, garlic sauce, spice paprika, and parsley. I love the addition of feta cheese and garlic sauce, it just makes the fries more fun to eat.   Now they do make the meal fast, it was around 15 minutes when my order came. The chicken kebob taste tender and flavorful especially when you eat it with tzatziki. And I am hooked on the Orzo Rice Pilaf, it's a nicely seasoned savory rice and they make it so fluffy and delicious. The Greek Salad is an added bonus, it has fresh crisp romaine lettuce topped with baby sliced cucumbers, red onions, kalamata olives, juicy tomatoes, feta cheese, spice paprika, a light drizzle of olive oil, and every ingredient in the salad is fresh. I love how my meal makes me feel good. Everything taste amazing.  The dining area is open and very spacious, it's like a happy place. The walls are painted in a pretty blue color which makes objects and artwork stand out. They add a silk flower to every table to give it a personal touch. Also there is an elevated lounge area where you can sit comfortably as a group and enjoy friendly conversations. The service is on point, there isn't a wait, your meal gets made fresh, the food is served fast, and they make you feel welcome. Now the highlight of my day is the amazing food and entertainment. My dining table is right next to the TV and I was excited when they started featuring Furious 7. It's the best day ever.",

The gyros were nice and thick sliced, hot pita bread and creamy. The garlic feta fries are a MUST  You can not go here and not get the fries! The chicken shawarma salad was fresh w/a huge amount of chicken to surely get the hungriest person full.

Now I know it's not going to be exactly the same but I was expecting some similarities especially since I've had Greek food in town before. I ordered a pita combo with fries and a plate of dolmades. The dolmades came out ice cold and I immediately thought ok someone forgot to warm these up. When the waiter came back with the rest of the food I asked about it and she stated they were served cold there and they didn't have a microwave to warm them up.....hmmmm what. First off a microwave wouldn't be an appropriate thing to tell a customer and I think they should have explained they are served cold as she stated a lot of previous customers had complained about it. She even told me about another restaurant down the street that served them hot. I didn't eat another bit and unfortunately she said she couldn't take them off the tab. The rest of the food was okay but I've honestly had better at other Greek places in ton. They serve big portions and my friend said her chicken Kabob  was very good. So overall three stars for being average",

It was not vinegretty at all.. it was like pure oil and a little spicy hint to it which I did not expect at all.  The salad itself look beautiful and tasteful but it just wasn't what it looked like.  On the other hand... the garlic feta fries were freaken DERICIOUS! They were juicy fries with lots of garlic flavor and soft feta cheese sprinkled all over. Also got the hummus appetizer which was also a little bland for my taste and not enough citrus. But they did give a lot of pita bread with it!  Baklava was absolutely delicious and you could see the pure honey on it and every bite had some crunch to it from the nuts.  Overall I would definately be back for the garlic fries and probably the salad but bring my own dressing.",

Once inside cozy ambiance with couch seating and a stage setup for live entertainment. But what about the food you ask? It'a awesome well prepared fresh made. I had the gyro and ordered their Feta Fries and I added a small Greek salad. Gyro tasted great what you would expect with all those Greek flavors, pita bread soft ingredients inside tasted like they cut it to order. Feta Fries great flavor they smelled killer and taste the same must try. Finally the in-house made baklava crisp and not too sweet perfect! I wanted to get coffee with but they dump their coffee at 7:00 one hour before close oh well lol! Parking easy staff very friendly. Too bad it not near where I live but now I know where to go for great affordable Greek chow!",

If it's not then it was way over cooked.   3 stars for the Price: we paid $26.10 for 2 combo sandwich wrap with one side each. FYI their combo doesn't come with drinks.

It came with lots of juicy chicken with this amazing sauce on top And on the side, the rice was perfectly cooked , warm pita bread wrapped in aluminum foil and a side Greek salad. Everything was so good i decided to go back a couple days later and order the grilled Athenian chicken plate. I heard so much about the garlic feta fries so i substituted the salad for the fries and requested extra amazing sauce. I was so disappointed this time around. The chicken was very very dry and the rice was hard and sitting in a pool of oil. The fries tasted old but had good flavor. I didn't get any pita bread or extra sauce which were my favorite parts of the meal before.. maybe because i got the fries instead of the salad. Needless to say the second time wasn't a charm but I'll still give it another try. I'll just go back to the original order and see how that goes.",

A few weeks ago I tried the gyro platter with garlic feta fries and they were AMAZING. My husband got the gyro sandwich which also looked delicious. The tall, young gentleman was a pleasure to talk with and he was very friendly. Last week I tried the Greek Salad since I started the Keto diet, and the Greek Salad is Keto friendly which makes me want to eat lunch here everyday now   The only negative thing I would say is the last few times I checked in, I never got my discount. So make sure when you check in, you double check to make sure you get your discount. It's usually the owners that don't apply the discount. But other than that, they are fantastic.",

When I popped in, I asked the lovely lady who helped me if they were the same folks who used to own the Greek Village Cafe years ago.  She said the previous owners were, which made me a little sad.  I knew Yanni from dance events we used to have at the Greek Village about 10 years ago, and was hoping to say hello.  I knew he used to own this shop as I ran into him at the tattoo parlor next door.  Anyway, previous owners aside, today I ordered a gyro salad and a side of garlic feta fries.  Believe, me you need these in your life.  I took it to go, and drove the 15ish minutes back to work.  My fries were still hot!  Woo hoo!  So let me tell you, the fries are amazing.  Perfect texture, with crumbly feta and something that gives them a little spice, they're served with a creamy sauce that is incredible.  I devoured this.    My gyro salad was perfect.  Kalmatta olives without the pits, crunch lettuce, feta, and perfect gyro meat, I completely stuffed myself finishing.  (came with tomato, as well, but I hate tomato, so I just pulled it off.  I always forget to ask to hold the tomato.)   I will absolutely be back, and soon.  Everything was delicious, and I'd like to try out more on the menu!!",

The falafel, not so.  Hard, dense, and very dry.    You'll want a lot of extra sauce.  Maybe I caught them at the end of a busy night but it was a little disappointing.",

Decor reminds me of why I need to go back to Greece real soon.   They don't have the typical Greek cuisine since they're more the Americanized Greek fast food restaurant but that's ok. Their food was still real good.   I had the lamb gyro w everything and finished it all. This doesn't usually happen but it was perfect size to satisfy and fill my hungry tummy.   The little egg rolls like appetizers were soooooo good. I could have just eaten those for dinner. We tried both spinach and the ones with spinach and chicken. Both had feta and were really delicious.   We had a few sides. Very pleased with all we ordered. The waitress offered us dessert but we were so full. I I'll need to have the baklava next time we come here.",

Walked into this small little restaurant with mostly table seating and a lounge area clean little place ,promptly seated given a menu with  good selections we ordered .  A Shawarma Platter for $11.99 and a Gyro Combo for $11.25 .  The platter came with Orzo Rice Pilaf, Small Greek Salad , and Pita Bread , starting with the salad it was fresh and crisp with a good Greek Salad dressing served with slightly grill pita that was crisp but soft in the inside we also had a order of hummus at the table which was Delicious ! The Shawarma a mixture of beef and lamb served on top of the rice was good but I noticed it was chopped and not shaved so you know I asked and the I believe the owner/ chef told me she prefer to serve it that way easier to chew well ok good nevertheless . Now the Chicken Gyro was good with the Tahini sauce to us it had a different taste not what we're used to it was kind of sweet but it was alright served with hummus which I already stated was good . All in all it was a good meal .  This is a nice little restaurant which has good Mediterranean Cuisine, Good service , Clean inside and Good food a must try ,and remember support your Local Small Businesses when in the area we will definitely come again !",

They had a tv on playing a hockey game which was so loud I couldn't pay attention to anything else.   Also, I order a chicken Greek salad and totally had a brain fart and forgot to ask for the dressing on the side. When I was finally able to track the owner down he was not super kind about the request saying that he had already made it and kinda huffing & puffing about how he would have to make a new one. I am way to big of a push over and agreed that it would be fine.   The salad was actually quite delicious and thankfully he didn't totally overdo it with the dressing but it was still a little too oily. The food alone is at least 4 starts and I might be back but only for take out and now I know to ask for the dressing on the side.   The owner did offer after the food came out to make me another one if I didn't like it, but it would have been nice to have been offered that option first.   They also have no restrooms and served my meal on a paper plate. In my opinion, it's a take out only place.",

Yanni's is small, housed behind the Del Taco and it's possible to miss seeing the sign if you're not looking for it sometimes, but it's there and it is worth eating there. The first time I ordered from there, I got the chicken shawarma platter (all platters include orzo rice pilaf, small Greek salad, and pita bread). The people behind the counter were friendly and my take-out food arrived quickly. I took my food home and ate the most delicious Greek food I've had in a really long time. I was also surprised by how filling the platter was, so much so that I was full the rest of the day.  I've also ordered the combo value meal with shawarma and a side dish of garlic feta fries. The food, especially the fries, blew my mind. The value meal also is enough food to keep me full the rest of the day, so unless you're a bottomless pit, I don't suggest getting some Yanni's late in the day.  I keep going back to Yanni's Greek Grill because the food is amazing and I'm satisfied with their customer service. I've never eaten in, as I'm usually too busy to, but while there isn't a public restroom, there Yanni's are friendly folk who make you feel at home, something I've witnessed time and time again while I waited for my food and other people were eating in. If you're in the area, definitely stop by Yanni's Greek Grill. I know I'm probably already there. ;)",

Had the gyro and garlic fries.  The gyro was huge and messy (as it should be).   Based on other Yelp reviews, I added a side of sauce, probably that's a good idea if you like a lot of sauce.

The owner is a friendly older Greek man and the servers are all so nice and friendly.  Not the cheapest but definitely huge portions and tasty food.  Their gyro salad fits in my low carb diet so I get a carry out usually once a week.  This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas.  They have since expanded their dining area and doubled the space.",

The sauces did not seem homemade and if they were, they were oily and runny.  The grape leaves are store-bought, greasy, oily things that have sat in cans too long.  The pita is thick and tasteless, no spices and hardly heated.  The only thing that was decent was the chicken, but for $35, crappy food, attitudes, and cheap plastic, we're not going back.

The hummus and pita arrived shortly after we sat down. The pita seemed homemade and the hummus was delicious. Next came our sandwiches...great flavor and the chicken was cooked perfectly.

This place is in the strip mall on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Silverado Ranch, behind the Del Taco and next to Capriotti's. It has about 15-20 tables that seat 4 each. I just did a takeout order, but the place is roomy enough to handle a 20-40 people. This is my first time here, so  I will be revisiting the place and will see how they do in the long run.",

Very friendly service. We ordered the gyro platter, gyro pita, spanakopita and hummus. The gyro meat was tasty and so was the tzatziki. The gyro meat on the platter had a small amount of possibly aoili drizzled on it, and I haven't had it anywhere else like that but it gave it a little more flavor. The spanakopita filling was delicious and fresh! The pastry was a little different and rolled up vs what you might find elsewhere cut into squares. I like Israeli hummus more but this hit the spot! My bf enjoyed it and said it was good and finished his meal.",

It is cozy restaurant, ultra casual and a bit on the dumpy side with most people placing orders to go though there is seating for around 10.  Neither of us were particularly hungry the evening of our visit so we each opted for traditional lamb/beef gyros.  The gyro meat, according to the restaurant's website, contains no fillers or MSG and I watched as it was sliced off a revolving spit.  The combination of gyro meat, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and fresh pita bread combined with a flavorful tzatsiki sauce made for a delicious light dinner.",

Everything is cheaply made in a hurry, awful quality ingredient and simply depressing. But, this! Mmm... I still have the flavor of the filet mignon kebob in my mouth from a week ago. The gyros, shawarma, falafel, dolmades and salad all are amazing. Just like eating at home. You really can tell when a cook puts in the effort, it simply tastes different and it's so good. Even, when I can't go in person, I Ubereats it. Oh and the olive oil/vinegar sauce.... It's literally orgasmic. Drizzle it on everything. Haha. The pita is always fresh, warm and soft, just like it's supposed to be. The fries are awesome too, especially with feta and herbs, but do yourself a favor and have an entree with a few sides instead.",

Ended up getting the Gyro platter which comes with the meat, Greek salad with light oil dressing, and rice pilaf. The meat is so good! Perfectly seasoned, not too salty. The rice pilaf is a mix of rice and orzo pasta, must of been cooked in some type of broth because it smelled and tasted so good! Th salad has olives, onions, cucumber, tomatoes and feta cheese on top, very good!  Also got an order of feta garlic fries... Oh my god .. Garlicky goodness. The fries are so crispy, very strong garlic flavors which I love, the sauce that comes with the fries is so good! Will definitely come back for more!!",

Highly recommended for excellent food and service!",

At Yanni's, you order at the register, pay, and then they bring out your food.   I had the gyro Greek salad and was not impressed at all. Usually, I love these at any Greek or Mediterranean restaurant but here the gyro meat was way too oily and the greens were kind old old looking and super bitter. It seems like they get really good reviews so I will give them another chance. My salad also came with grilled pita bread. I though it was funny that the only hot sauce they had was Asian Chili sauce... Lol   The service was great... The cashier was very friendly and kept checking up on me and so did the owner/chef.",

I am very picky with my Greek food and since there aren't many good places in Vegas to pick from, I always stick to the same 2 places I know. However, based on the great reviews, I decided to give this place a chance and try something new. Upon entering, we noticed the place was completely empty. We were told we could sit anywhere and we did so. The server comes and takes our order. We ordered their hummus as appetizer as well as their dolmades. As our main course, my husband ordered their filet mignon kebob plate, and I ordered the chicken kebob plate. The plates come with a side salad and with rice. The hummus was good (not the best I've had). The dolmades were very good! The meat was what made me give this review such low stars. It was completely flavorless!! I am not sure why that is, because any time I've had Greek food, it is loaded with flavor. That wasn't the case, unfortunately, and this is why we will not be returning. I was super disappointed because of the great reviews and because of the appetizers, which  weren't bad. I made this review so that perhaps the owners could consider my comments. They have a great location and I feel as though this is a problem that could be rectified very easily.",

It was little chunks of chicken with seasoning fried on a flat top. The service was ok but seemed like everyone one there were regulars. In my opinion this made the service or allowed the service to be too relaxed. Overall, I will come back if I cannot find another Greek place eat.",

The flavor of the food is solid and on a tasty scale it deserves a solid 4/5.   The only reason why I give this place a 3 is the inconsistency in my salad. It had a very generous helping of chicken but the veggie ratio of cucumber vs lettuce was significantly off. The menu also had a product called garlic greek fries but the outcome was more like greek buffalo fries instead. On the other habd my boyfriend loved his gyro.   I'd come back for a 2nd shot and we'll see goes.",

They load up the gyro pita/sandwich with meat. The rice with the plates is very good as well, they also come with a nice mini Greek side salad. I always get the garlic fets fries, they're good but need a touch additional seasoning (salt). Friendly staff. They make it fresh so it takes maybe 10 min but worth it. Tables are kinda small so large party's take note.   I'm a huge fan of gyros, this is a close second place to the best in town and I've been here nearly 20 years.   Maybe a touch over priced, I was tempted to go to 4 stars because of that but nice staff, fresh ingredients, and nice meaty portions made up for it. Definitely worth a try.",

The hummus app only came with one pita cut in slices, and additional pitas were another .50 cents, but I just saved the hummus for the fries.   Seriously, the food is great here.  And I don't speak Greek, but I think the employees were talking to each in it, which gives it some authenticity.  Also, the drinks are served by the can, which cost a dollar.

    "text": "I was really looking forward to enjoying this place with all the great reviews. We were extremely disappointed. One of those rare occasions I forgot my cell phone or I could have posted pictures to explain why. I ordered a vegetarian plate with hummus, baba & falafel. The hummus was form fitted to the section in the plate just like jello pudding cups, was this plated in the morning for my 7:30 pm visit? Not what I expect when they post a sign on the counter that they don't have specials because they don't use (have?) leftovers. Really wish I'd had my phone to take a picture. Baba was not as form fitted, but both were covered in a clear oil, if it even was olive it had no olive taste or color so either low quality or not even olive. I have had better hummus buying pre-packaged at the grocery stores. Baba did not impress either, sad that I have made it once at home from an online recipe & my guests loved that, this one taste was enough. I will continue to drive on to Stephano's when craving some baba. I love falafel, to the extreme that when I go to Parsley Mediterranean Grill, as soon as I walk in they ask me how many orders of falafel I want that day. Here, when I called before going to see if they were gluten-free, I was told they are made from a mix which is gluten free - garbanzo, fava & corn oil. But judging from the shape & texture - these were like balls of bean flavored cake - almost like cupcake consistency. Were they baked or fried? There wasn't oil on the plate under them & they soaked up the tahini that was squirted on them. Baked would be healthier, but these just didn't cut it for me. I ate  1/2 of one & it came with 4. Yes, I left hungry having eaten less than 2 full bites of a $10 plate. His kebab plate which he ordered the chicken charred wasn't even showing a speck of char on the second trip from the grill (yes we know it's unhealthy charred but it's how he likes it & ordered it). The Greek salad on the plate was drenched in oil so it was flavorless because as I've said, the oil has no color or taste. Probably why there is so much paprika spread on the top, guess not just for presentation but if any taste is desired, mix it in. Maybe they were in a rush to get out since it was about closing time, but for $30 with the above, an order of their garlic feta fries & a can of soda , if eating off plastic plates & utensils the food should be good.  This kind of reminds me of food in a mall's food court, not a stand alone restaurant Food was 1 star, service would have been 3 but couldn't get his char on, cleanliness is what brought them up to 2 stars.  Still trying to figure out all those 5-star reviews. I use yelp all the time to find great new places, but this time I feel really let down. Maybe for meat eaters this is good, but definitely don't recommend for a vegan.",

The owner does the cooking in an open area with his wife (I think).  Strangely, the cooking area behind the counter is 3-4 times bigger than the dining area, which only has 2-3 tables (there are more tables outside).  The owner is very friendly and easygoing.  We asked if there was any relation to Yanni's Gyros.  He said that he used to own it, sold it, and opened up this new place.  I followed up with \"So that means the food here is better than the other place, right?\"  The owner smiled and said he wasn't sure.  I got the shawarma pita combo with the garlic freta fries.  The shawarma uses the same meat as the gyro, except instead of tzaziki sauce, it comes with shawarma sauce.  I found the shawarma sauce to be in-between the creamy white tzaziki sauce and the heavy hummus mix.  I asked for some tzaziki sauce and converted the second half of my pita into a normal gyro, which I preferred more.  The gyro/shawarma pita is huge.  The gyro meat was delicious, tasty with consistent texture.  The pita came with significantly more meat than Yanni's Gyros; I didn't taste any difference in the meat between the two, but my friend said that the meat at Yanni's Greek Grill was a little saltier.  The garlic fries were tasty and similar to that offered by Yanni's Gyros.   What to do: Order and pay at the counter.  The owner will then bring the food to your table, along with plastic utensils and napkins.  When finished, just leave your plates at the table and the owner will cleanup.  Tip jar is located on the counter.  There is plenty of parking in the mall lot.  There is no public restroom in the restaurant.",
