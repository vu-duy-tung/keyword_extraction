    "text": "My bf and I had a superb culinary experience here.  Laing, sinigang, and Max's fried chicken and white rice were what we ordered and it was all superb.  The waiter Noah was very nice and the food was served within about 15 minutes - I heard the Glendale (California) location takes about three times as long to get served.  If you want great Filipino food, go to Max's.  Actually, Max's was our second choice.  We were going to go to Wicked Spoon buffet but could not justify paying like 50 bucks apiece to them for food that we probably would not have liked so well, and neither of us is a big eater so as much as I wanted a Vegas buffet, I don't think it would've been worth it.  Next time I am here, I will definitely return!  I'm not a pinoy (my bf is though), I'm a Mediterranean mix, but I love far eastern food, Filipino food especially.  Not sure why.  The food and the people of The Philippines has always been a personal magnet.  Oh btw, the fried chicken is not even really greasy.  The way they prepare it is such that it is not like KFC's or other places that serve \"real\" fried chicken.  The meat was most and delicious.  I am usually a harsh critic - if I don't like something, I let it be known.  But there wasn't anything to criticize at Max's!  How wonderful is that?!",

    "text": "Filipinos go to great lengths to find the next best Filipino restaurant out there, especially when the restaurant carries the name of one of the oldest chains in the Philippines, but unfortunately this Max's Restaurants fails to impress or sets out to disappoint. I ate there on 2 occasions ever since they opened, the first time was lunch, we thought that there would be a long line, but we were seated immediately, I thought great, we can make it back to work in time, wrong! We only ordered like 3 items and it took them 1 hour to bring it to hour table. We had the famous fried chicken, the skin was indeed crispy but the meat was so dry, you would probably need to double up on your soda order since they don't do refills, so Filipino mentality, tsk tsk tsk. The second time I went there it was a friends party, they had pre-ordered the food ahead of time as to avoid the hunger evoking wait, we had crispy pata, which wasn't that great, the usual chicken, pancit, kare kare, adobo that didn't look appetizing at all, over all the food was edible, at least they had a room that can accommodate large parties and give you some privacy. The service was below par, the server just left her cleaning cart in the room while we were still eating and did not really attend to our needs well, especially when you are charging/expecting a gratuity charge for large parties. The napkins were cut in half, so typically Filipino again. I am proud to be Filipino but Filipino mentality really irks me because hey are we not in America? Overall, will I come back? Only if i am not paying for it. Have the Filipinos finally found their white whale? Sorry you will have to continue searching for the best Filipino restaurant out because Max's is definitely sub standard.",

    "text": "It's a very nice filipino restaurant, if that's the reason you would go to any restaurant is the \"prettiness\" then this is the place to go. If your looking for good Filipino food then I wouldn't recommend this place. I expect any Asian restaurants food to taste better or at least just as good as I cook. I'm not the best cook but OMG so much better than this place. This was a big fail. Not only was it overpriced for mediocre bland food the so called \"family style servings\" (really) was only a 2 person serving, 1 person if that's all you were gonna eat. I enjoy the smaller more simple filipino restaurants as their food tastes better and are more realistically priced. Yes you pay more here for the ambiance understandably so. Well after all they do have to price food to balance out costs, labor and rent I assume. I was so excited to try their beef sisig ($13) as it came sizzling on a small iron platter. Ugh but much to my dismay it had a hint of curry flavor and what looks to be a bit of mayo or some kind of white cream mixed with the chopped beef, onions and jalepenos. Don't get me wrong I enjoy eating curry but not what I expected when I thought sisig. I wanted more of a tang, I even squeezed the lemon wedges on it and it didn't help the flavor any. The pancit canton was so so just on flavor I didn't like the noodles as it tasted like they used the dried package canton noodles. Would've been much much better if they'd use fresh noodles. The palabok was bland, the spaghetti was no different than jufran sauce with a tiny bit of grd meat. The only thing I came close to enjoying was their fried chicken. They must use small filipino chickens tho. The staff is pleasant and although our server was very nice it doesn't make up for the fact that he just wasn't a good server. He took our order and brought our food. Those were the only 2 times he came on his own. We had to flag him down to ask for our sodas to be refilled and find him yet again to get our check. I must mention they weren't at at all busy and we were his 2nd table in the area. Oh and really what's the deal with the worcestershire sauce and tabasco on the tables c'mon it's a Filipino restaurant for goodness sake. I understand the jufran being there but where's the patis and spicy vinegar?",

    "text": "I do a lot of marketing in the area so when I saw this restaurant, I got excited as it was one of our favorite filipino restaurant when we lived in San Diege. So I decided to have lunch there that day. The team members were very polite with their hello ma'am, yes ma'am, etc. The place was clean, bright and big, unlike most filipino restaurants, where you stand in line and point out what item you would like. Max's had a menu you can choose from.  Since I was by myself, I waited for quite sometimes (maybe 10-15 mins) until someone finally came and asked if I've been helped??? What????? I tried to get their attention so that I can order something to drink at least since I was parched, but I seemed to be invisible to them. Anyways, the lady immediately took my drink order and said she will be back to take my order, I stopped her and told her what my order was, as I did not want to wait again just for them to take my order. I am on my lunch break afterall. At this time, I only had 45 mins left of it.  My drink was delivered to my table immediately followed by my order there after.  The fried chicken was really delicious, just as I remembered it. Then my bill was handed to me. Sticker-shocked!!! For a sago drink and lunch special with tax cost me nearly $21. What the heck, were there gold speckles on the chicken?? LOL.",

The service, the attitude, the quality of food and the prices are absolutely dreadful and pathetic. This particular branch is an embarrassment to the franchise. My family, friends and I, are fans of the brand. If you want to find out the hard way, to actually waste your money to dine here, be my guest. I guarantee that you will be extremely disappointed. I'm surprised that this place is still open. I'll give it a few more months. Who are the clowns running this place? Seriously! There are so many other Filipino restaurants in town, that would have far more better service, a positive attitude, a much more enjoyable and edible food, for the right price! My advice, don't waste your money here. I'm not a hater, I just take my food very seriously, especially when I have to spend my hard earned money. Definitely not at this establishment, ever. (That one star is the lowest. I wish I could've given them no star at all. They don't deserve it!)",

Although pricey, but just like any sit-down restaurant you are not only coming for the food but for the experience. Casual/trendy set-up with a bar welcoming you at the front door, as you turn the corner with a dim dining room, as you sit down you will notice that the small spotlights on the ceiling focuses on the table and not whats around you. The star of the show is obvious; the food. We ordered bangus belly, beef kalderata, lechon kawali and famous garlic rice. All done/cooked/presented well. Kaldereta had a different sauce than your normal fast food turo-turo place. Probably because its not populated with oil. Although msg is obvious it was executed well. The lechon was the hit. Crispy outside and moist inside perfect combo with the filipino staple mang tomas lechon sauce. Best lechon i have had so far. Great service, food takes longer than a normal filipino place, but worth the wait. Well done!",

I was so excited to try this place out because it was one of my favorite chain restaurant back home, so I coerced my dad to go here with me after we did some grocery shopping over at Seafood City; We both were highly disappointed with this place. It's nothing like the Max's back home. Ok, maybe their chicken was good but that's about it. We ordered sisig, which turned out to be mediocre, had some lumpiang ubod which tasted fake, and their pancit bihon and the spaghetti that came with my daughter's kid's meal tasted like how instant ramen noodles taste like; My daughter pushed her plate away and said it was yucky and tasted like goop and paste. And the server we had wasn't good as well. I work in the restaurant industry and I always feel bad giving bad tips to servers but I barely wanted to give our server a tip. He was rushing us with our food, was talking to us condescendingly, and was rude and gave us bad attitude when my daughter accidentally spilled her drink on the table, and let me cleaned up after her without even offering me extra napkins or towels to wipe it up. All this happened while the restaurant was almost empty. I'm really disappointed. Hopefully they train their staff better and do something about their food.",

While waiting for the food (which took a while), I was observing the manager that has Nico on his name tag. First, I saw him smiling and giggling while talking to some female waiters but then a few mins later I saw him talking to a male waiter and it seemed that he was scolding him. Telling someone about their mistake is one thing but yelling and being rude like that manager Nico towards the male waiters was unacceptable.  I really feel bad for the waiters to the point that I wanted to confront that manager but I figured I should just put it here on yelp so people would know and if the upper management of Max's is reading this, please do something about it. I have been to this Max location four times and its obvious that they lack coordination and good management.  Food was okay but not that impressive.   One more thing, the table beside us found a fly on their food but apparently it does not matter because they were still billed for their orders. They just replaced the food and moved on as if it's not a big deal finding a fly on your food. The name of their waiter was Kurt.  And please don't let employees with open cuts to serve or even get near the food because it's a healthy hazard.   Oh and I saw Nico touching the female waiter's back..wonder if that's part of the job.  If they want positive feedback from people then changes have to be made and start with employees and the food.",

You name it, missing order, wrong food, wrong bill and having to flag down the server JUST to get drink & a refill WOW! The server is clueless on how to do his job! He looked lost and confused on how to do his job. What's even more disturbing & surprising to me is when I attempted to addressed and inform the manager to let him know what's going on, he was even worst! I realized that the manager is part of the problem! He needs a major understanding and training on how hospitality works! Rather than understanding our concern and solving the problem, he could not wait to leave our table without offering any solution or apologizing instead he run back to the kitchen pretending nothing is wrong! Whoever the owner that invested money to open this place should really take a long hard look on how bad this place is being run! After waiting for over 45 minutes to get a table I expect to have great service! Good food alone won't do specially in Vegas when there are multiple restaurant that are completing for the market share! This place will go bankrupt if the service does not improve! This is my first time dinning to this place you can rest assure that I will NOT be coming back to this restaurant!  There you go you've been warn!",

The lady at the counter when we first walked in was pretty much rude. She almost had a outside voice and just shouted at us to sit down. Plus they don't have enough tables and chairs so i think they might need to renovate. We pretty much waited for probably about 20 minutes to just get a table and maybe and extra 15 minutes to get our food ready. They need to speed up. Don't be a slowpoke actually speedwalk atleast instead of walking like you just hiked a huge mountain or ran a 5k marathon. Plus when my mom order her pancit and sisig her sisig had 2 pieces of scotch tape in it. When she showed it to the manager the manager decided to make half of our meals $7.00 off.

The girl at the front, I asked her for some eating utensils since I got their budget meal for $9 and the Bistek (did not even come with rice for this price!) $14; was a total joke. The chicken was small and there was no taste. The Shanghai Lumpia egg rolls had no taste to them, did not taste right at all. The portion of the rice was small. The beef steak that we ordered was very expensive the meat was crappy there was way too much gravy that had no taste and it was very starchy. The container they threw it in was not very convenient as well and just all-around very sloppy. This is definitely not authentic Filipino food cooking like my mother's.   People said to try this place I am so disappointed and I don't understand how they are ripping off filipinos with this crappy food. The girl at the front didn't even want to give me the proper eating utensils. I asked for sweet and sour sauce the duck sauce for the egg rolls & soy sauce and she looked at me like I was nuts!?? These are all typical items that if you are Filipino and she is in fact Filipina she should know that these are simple requests that normally come with what you're ordering. Egg rolls of course people are going to want the duck sauce with those crispy Lumpia Shanghai. Of course people are going to want to eat their food with the proper eating utensils giving me one spoon is not going to work when I'm standing there with my two children and we are obviously three people?? Has she ever heard of a fork? LOL that would have helped, as well. I don't understand how all these Filipino joints in town are trying to rip off the general public and filipinos with crappy overpriced food?? Just because it's novelty because there are not that many places around doesn't mean it makes it okay. Most Filipino food is not a great quality to begin with I remember my lil mama would love to cook with the fatty meat haha and trying to charge astronomical prices is really disrespectful to us. My mother would always find the most economical way to serve us absolutely delicious food so please don't get what I'm saying twisted. All the Filipino restaurants that I've gone to their food cannot compare to my mother's in taste or quality. So that's merely what I'm trying to say.   Goldilocks for instance, I know this is a different restaurant; is trying to act like it's a gourmet restaurant and they're another place where the food is sub-par no where even near what they're trying to charge and it's no longer a point point joint they want you to sit down drop all this money on horrible food tip wait staff you can't even go up to the counter and order food past a certain time because they're trying to get a minimum of 15 bucks per menu item off of you by making you sit down is absolutely ridiculous what a disgrace to Filipinos! Years ago when I went to their Los Angeles location I remember the food was just okay but at least they served sinigang soup now they serve egg drop soup WTF!??  I have only been offered that at Chinese restaurants!?? So I really don't understand how such an important staple like sinigang soup isn't even available at a Filipino place?? Makes absolutely no sense to me!!?   Yelp is making me give a star rating but I would give it zero Stars if I could please excuse the voice to text thank you for reading this avoid Max's and most of these Filipino joints in town if you can get authentic Filipino food from a real Filipino that would be best... gosh, I wish my mom still cooked!",

    "text": "With family in town my parents wanted to take them to a spot they were all familiar with from the Philippines -- Max's. This chain restaurant has locations in the Philippines, US, and Canada. Even though I'm Filipino, I'm not a fan of the cuisine in general. But, this place is ok.   Highlights of our meal were the signature fried chicken with its crispy, crackly skin; the lechon kawali that could have spent less time in the deep fryer; and the tiny but well seasoned lumpiang Shanghai. The massive ham hock that made up the beer braised pata tim was fork-tender, with subtle hints of sweetness and sour to compliment the gaminess of the meat. It's a large dish that should be shared. Max's inasal -- grilled chicken -- had some decent flavors, particularly the soy sauce with garlic and ginger, but it was another dish that suffered from being too dry. The crabmeat fried rice was heavy on peas and light on crab and the rice was stickier than I prefer in fried rice dishes.   I wasn't a fan of the crepe-wrapped lumpiang ubod and although my family loves halo halo I've never been a fan of the dessert. I've never understood their fondness for a dessert with so many different ingredients thrown together. Although I did pick at the best parts of it, namely the flan and ube ice cream.  The prices aren't bad either. The seven of us ate family style for a reasonable price per person with boxes and boxes of leftovers. With some minor fine tuning they could be producing some of the better Filipino food in town.",

I had more beef sisig for tonight's dinner. Translation... The orgasmic sensations continued.

Mom is Malabon, where they cook very well.    Max's is a nice and clean place.  Looks like you stepped into a Wendy's or a Fridays, which is impressive for a Filipino restaurant.  Max's in the Philippines isn't that great, because ingredient quality in the PI is terrible.  Here in America, the food is well-prepared and flavorful.  We got there aright at opening, so no issues with speed, but I can see how things can slow down if the place has multiple tables in play.    We had the lumpia ubod, whole chicken, kare kare, crispy pata, and bulalo.  All of it was good.  We even wrapped everything and flew back home to the midwest with it.  All things considered, this is a good place for Filipino food.  You should try it.",

Although the prices here are decent, I'd much rather go to a local Filipino place that serves authentic, great tasting food (just like back home) .. With faster, more friendly service.   Appetizers came along with the entrees, and rice came in last. The sinigang was too salty, although it had that distinct sour taste I was looking for. The grilled pork (liempo) we had ordered had to be sent back by myself since all the chopped up pieces were half-cooked (if not raw at all) The server was always nowhere to be found, drinks took forever to get filled. Overall poor dining experience and food wasn't up to par.  Definitely not coming back!",

We order our food and drinks and wait. And Wait... And wait.. And wait some more. When I checked my phone I noticed that we had been waiting for 40 minutes for our food. We asked our waiter how much longer the food would be and he said \"soon.\" Twenty minutes later, we finally got our food.  We were so excited to get our food only to find that it was cold. The flavor was good, but when you're starving and wait about an hour for your food, you expect it to be up to standard. So the fact that it was cold kinda put us all in a bad mood. Especially when the people sitting next to us who just came in got their food before us! Really, annoying.  So the food was good but don't come if you're hungry because you'll have to wait a long time. The staff was polite and apologetic about the long wait. We even got a little free dessert because we waited so long.   Overall, I'd probably come back because of the taste of the food. You should give this place a try if you're willing to wait.",

Had to repeat it several times to the waiter, he then went to the kitchen to \"ask\"  When he returned 10 minutes later he said it was to large of a portion for us. We told he we didn't care and to charge us for the asparagus it's fine. 10 more minutes passed and a cook from the kitchen came to our table and informed us the manager would not allow the kitchen to put asparagus with the tofu? Twilight zone, possibly worst service I've had in my life.",

We were so disappointed because that was the reason why we went there. We ordered Kare Kare not the best one, sisig have too much vinegar, daing na bangus was good but the atshara has no taste at all, the fried chicken wasn't that bad and the halo halo was ok. I gave 2 star for the servers even though they forgot to bring out soup that's included with order and  I have to remind them. They apologized so many times but we suggested that if they have the lumpia they should cross it out from the menu. Not probably our choice to eat again.",

And some of these reviews aren't even True.  Just a bunch of haters who doesn't appreciate good quality filipino foods.  People say that this restaurant has small portions of food for a big price.   Not exactly.   I see normal size food for a reasonable price.   I got the combo with everything.  Rice, fresh lumpia, and crispy fried half chicken which the chicken is big not small as people suggested.  The chicken is extra crispy.   I can hear the crunch every time I took a bite. I was completely happy and full.  I also love there desserts.   I got the Halo-Halo ice cream which was really big and filling.  So if you want traditional filipino food, come to this restaurant.   They will treat you like your back home in the Philippines.",

The interior of this building is beautifully designed. Seems clean but when we were seated, I wish they sweep the floor. There was a couple grains of rice and pieces of food under the table which was unacceptable. A couple of our chairs on our table were ripped...  Service was very poor. It took awhile for someone just to take our order for drinks and to bring them out. It took forever again to come back and take our order for food.  Estimated about 45 minutes to an hour for our food to finally arrive to our table. The presentation was beautiful and the taste was very satisfying. We started with a sampler which had calamari, sweet potatoe fries and egg rolls. Main course not sure what my family ordered but had 2 bowls of fish soup, of course the full size max chicken and sigsig.  Our server was nowhere to be found the majority of the time. We really needed our drinks to be refilled and every time we asked someone to get our refills they all said \"ok\" but none of them actually came back. We finally got the attention of our server to finally refill our drinks.  I wish they took away the plates that were done so we had more room or didn't have to stare at an empty dish the whole time. Service really was unacceptable and in my opinion a failure but the food was the only good experience.   Hopefully you guys fix your customer service!",

My family went to Max's on Mother's day for dinner and as expected it was pretty busy.We waited about about 30 minutes which is a typical for a restaurant that is busy.  I have to agree with a lot of the reviews here and say the service is pretty bad. We were seated at about 6:45 and our server says he'll be with us shortly. Time passes and it is now 7:10 when our server gets back to us to take our drink and food orders. I'd say that's quite a long time to get back to us from an initial \"I'll be with you guys shortly.\"   Luckily our food didn't take as long as how long it took to order. We ordered Crispy Pata, BBQ Skewers, Bistek, Sisig, Nilagang Baka, Garlic Rice, and Sweet Potato Fries. I was expecting the meat to be tough like people were saying, but it turned out pretty tender. We all enjoyed what we ate. Although it was odd to have sugar on their Sweet Potato Fries, not bad though.  While we were eating we rarely saw our server and when we did it seemed like he was all over the place in different sections. We were never offered or received any refills on our waters once. It was even hard to flag him down to get the check.  TLDR: Overall we enjoyed the food, but the service could have been better, much better.",

    "text": "-I had lunch here twice over the weekend, during my visit in Vegas w/ fam. The food was great! Nice and hot. We had the Garlic Rice, Fried Chicken, and Egg rolls. Taste is pretty much identical to the Max's restaurant that we have here in Glendale CA, except the Kare-Kare, my mom and her bf thought it was better; meaning they have excellent cooks/chefs. Hats off to you guys. Oh and the desserts were good as well, we've tried the Ube Icecream, Buko Pandan, and Halo halo.   -The service.. well the first time it was terrible. Our table was overlooked the whole time. I didnt get the server's name but he pretty much ignored our table, nice guy though, just needs some work. But the female server, even though she wasnt our server then, she stole our attention. She reminded me of myself at my old job; so rest assured your hardwork does not go unnoticed. I believe her name is Andrea? Yeaaah I cant be wrong, I remember getting tongue twisted when I say her name *facepalm* lol. She's very active; we noticed how she's being bombarded with tasks left and right, and still strives to do her best :') She's serving with those gigantic trays at fast paced, while busing, and doing the cash register at the same time. Back and forth. It was that crazy since we arrived. Im like wow she's a strong lady, very remarkable. Yesterday, our last day in Vegas :'( we decided to have lunch here again, we were lucky to have her this time around. She's a sweet person, and polite, and very attentive, always checks up on us. We're glad to have you. You were great! and I admire your hardwork. Much appreciated. I wish you the best! ^_^  Do I still recommend this place? Absolutely. I mean the service has its own flaws depending on the server you get, but in a matter of time im sure it can be fixed. Give it a chance, try it out. If you dont, you'll gonna miss out.",

If you have 2 people in your group they will make you wait even if they have a lot of tables open!  The 2 girls said 15 to 20 minutes wait while they go back and forth on what table of 4 they will give to 2 people, it was ridiculous! It happened to other couples that came in behind us too.  SMH. Oh and no refill on our waters.   For food,  we had kare kare, it had more  food coloring than peanut flavor, meat was tough.  Sizzling pork was just okay,  needed more kalamsi and crispiness.  Bistek was just okay, meat was very tough and the sauce/gravy is too thick.  Garlic rice was good,  I'll give them that.  Halo halo for desert was good.  Buko drink, um no, not worth 4 bucks.",

After looking at some awesome pictures on Yelp, we came by one night last week and the pics don't lie.  For $5.95 you are treated to one of the best versions of halo-halo in town.  This one had leche flan and the ice was shaved to a great consistency; these are two features that are often lacking in other versions of halo-halo here.   Back in 2013, the b/f and I did a halo-halo challenge where we tried most of the ones in town and we sure missed out on Max's.  It would probably have been #1 or #2 on the list (I still have that list up but I'm too lazy to post the link; you can find it if you try ;) )  So, long story long, if you want some great halo-halo for a good price, come to Max's.  We'll be back.  Masarap!!",

    "text": "Came today and try this new resto. Iam full pinoy and my standard of pinoy food is simple and basic: if my grandma and mother can cook better, it should not be served on restuarants.   We ordered 8 things in the menu; Chicken Sinigang na hipon Lechon kawali Nilaga Chicken sisig Pork sisig Pancit miki bihon  Laing  In this 8 items only the laing is what my mom and grandma dont cook. Anyways lets start with the good, the chicken. Its one of the best crunchy and flavored chicken we had in restuarants, my mom agreed its good, and I liked it too.  Unfortunately thats where the good things stops. The other 6 items (excluding laing which was okay regarding to my family, i have no taste for it.) So for the bland foods are the following; pancit and nilaga. It was so bland i have to use 1 spoon full of condiments to make them taste anything. The nilaga was served cold too. Next the super salty are the following; kawali, pork sisig, chicken sisig, all of this items have strong salty taste, too salty that we were not able to eat them all. The last one the hipon na sinigang, they got the \"asim\" (TANGY) part but they did not catch other flavor than that. This sinigang is missing that unique sinigang flavor.  In the end i was only able to enjoy my plate due to the chicken that was really good. When i was over, i had a full bowl of the soups (untouched) pancit on the side which i tasted only once, the sisigs were just next to my pancit and the other stuff making my entire plate half full.   Oh i would like to add it took the food to come in 35 minutes. I finished the freaking 1 episode of a tv series before they come all together. Which i think is the reason why our soups were cold, if iam not wrong it means that the soups were sitting on the counter but they were waiting for all the foods to be finished before serving them.   In the end Max didnt deliver the filipino food that i expected. Back home they are known for the chicken, i guess they should only stick with that. There are better less known restaurants with real flavored, well served, authentic filipino cuisine around.  Update: last time we went here they had 5 stars it's down to 3 now. Not surprise.",

Everyone is so nice!! If you are new to Filipino food or just want a really good sit-down Filipino lunch/dinner, this is the place for you!  My favorites: 1. Fried Chicken - Light crispiness all around. An original recipe that you will love. Eat with banana sauce (available upon request). 2. Daing na Bangus - Boneless milkfish. It is thick and flaky -- better than the one at Salo-Salo Grill, not to mention other Filipino food places. 4. Bangus Sisig - Sizzling boneless milkfish in a flavorful vinegar sauce with onions and ginger. 5. Garlic Rice  SKIP the: 1. Spaghetti - A huge portion (enough for 2), but not really memorable. Sauce was just 'ok.'  Maybe try: 1. Tapsilog (marinated sirloin strips with eggs and garlic rice) - Good too, but tastes a lot like Korean BBQ...i.e., it's sweeter, and doesn't taste like the usual Tapa dish.. Only get this if you are feeling a sweeter beef, like Korean BBQ.  Portions are huge and heavy (you're eating this with rice, after all), so just get 1 dish per person. Be sure to come hungry and just return to try other dishes.  We will definitely be returning....again and again!",

Most of the food was good, but a few things were heavily seasoned. Like the soup we had the sinigang and it was super salty and sour. Even the pancit was a bit salty. For dessert we had halo halo.

    "text": "It's the infamous Max franchise! Now finally located in Las Vegas! We just had to go try it. The establishment is very nice and upscale, a lot better than most filipino restaurants, but the food and service was ok. They were out of sisig and kare kare which apparently his the most popular dishes. I was super bummed to find that we couldn't order it since that was all I was looking forward to. Other dishes included chicken adobo, beef steak, and pancit bihon and palabok, and sinigang.   You can also divide or section off parts of the place if you're looking to celebrate here with a big party which is pretty cool. The service was good, and thy were very attentive and apologetic to us when they were out of certain dishes. However, to be out of not just one dish but two...I feel poses a problem if you're trying to service your customers because they expect to have whatever is on the menu.",

    "text": "Oh man... let me just say that the food we had here was delicious. The service was lacking. That's putting it lightly.  I mean,  they weren't rude. Just S L O W...  We came here for my Dad's birthday. They were not busy at all and it looked like they had more than enough staff and empty tables to accommodate the 5 groups of people waiting for a table (including our party of 6).  We waited about 25 minutes. Not too bad you would think, but when you see the staff just standing around and empty tables you'd think they could sit you right away, but no. There were also several tables not bussed the whole time we were at the restaurant.   When we finally were seated, we pretty much knew what we were going to order because we looked at the menu while we were waiting for our table. We had the pork sinigang,  lechon kawali,  pancit canton,  daing na bangus,  Max's chicken, large garlic fried rice and small steamed rice. We just ate family style. Everything we had was cooked well and really delicious. My only complaint about that was that the dipping sauce for the lechon kawali was ice cold.   Now the service. It took us maybe 15 minutes or so before someone came to take our drink order and since we were already aware of the mediocre service we ordered our food as well. We didn't want to wait another 15 minutes to order. 30 minutes later we finally received our food. The kitchen looked busy, but there were maybe 4-5 other tables in the restaurant besides ours. I don't know why it would take that long for our food.   For dessert I got a buko pandan which I order at their restaurant when I'm in Oahu and my mom got halo halo to share with everyone.  The buko pandan didn't taste the same as the other restaurant in Oahu and wasn't the same green color. It looked really light. It wasn't as coconut tasting as expected. The halo halo was huge and my parents thought it was decent tasting.   I wish they the service was better because I would go back, but I would rather not have to deal with the slow service. I really like the food here, but it's not worth my time.  Oh and by the way, the tables that had not been bussed when we arrived were still sitting there still not bussed when we left.  I don't think I'll be back unless they fix the service issue.",

We typically go to the one in Glendale which already has a good reputation. We were thrilled to find this one in Vegas.   Even with all the five-star restaurants and sumptuous buffets we had in Vegas, it was also mandatory for us to squeeze in a trip to Max's.  We had their famous fried chicken, miki bihon, lumpia shangai, tinola soup and calamansi juice. What a treat! It was a pleasant change from all of the food offerings on the Strip. Great service too.  Now if only Max's could re-open a branch in San Diego...",

We ordered a variety of food, including lechon kawali, garlic rice, palabok, and the specials. The food was really good. It reminded me of home and was heaven in my mouth. The lechon kawali was perfectly crunchy. The palabok was nicely sauced. The entrees cost more than other smaller Filipino restaurants, but I think it's worth it.  The decor of this place is modern and I really like it. It looks clean and well organized. There are also dividers, which I'm assuming can be used for private parties.  The service was okay; it could've been better. The waiter got one of the specials wrong, but it was no biggie.  I recommend Max's, especially to those that want to try Filipino food for the first time.",

We started off with the Pork Egg Rolls which were very tasty, along with the dipping sauce. I will certainly order them again next time.  As the \"main course\" for lunch, had the Whole Fried Chicken, Rice Noodles with Chicken, and a bowl of Garlic Rice. All were very very good, and would order it all again, but will try other items in the future.  The fries served with the Whole Fried Chicken were disappointing as they arrived cold. However, they were replaced with a sizable bowl of hot fries when asked for a replacement. The ladies liked the fries so much, they took the leftovers with them when we left.  Overall, it was a very good meal, although somewhat pricey, but reasonably pricey. Not overpriced, even though it was Las Vegas.",

Upon arriving we were quickly greeted by Will and got a great table. Will was very knowledgable of all the great menu items and assisted us in a very friendly and caring manor.  The lumpia appetizers were so yummy.  Will got our drinks and appetizers out Super Fast !!!! The Crab Fried rice is to die for ... Amazing delicious !!!! Had Luchon  Kawali. And was the best I have ever eaten !!!! My fiance had Pansit be hon and she said it was amazing as well.   The portions are huge and enough for 3 people !!!! The restaurant was very clean and neat.  Bathrooms spotless.. I will most definitely be back and I hope Will will be here to take care of us again !!!!! Loved it !!!!   David M Cole.  From Houston TX",

To my surprise,  my wife and I saw very few patrons, servers socializing among themselves and the other one putting napkins and utensils on the table to appear busy.  We waited for someone to seat us at a table.  Instead, none of them notice or approach us so we end up seating ourselves at a table.  We waited ten minutes at our table until I had to walk up to a server to give us a menu.  However, the food quality consistently deserves five stars.  That's the main reason why I decided to return to this restaurant whenever I visit Vegas from L.A.

It has gotten better for me, the wait times have shortened because the 'hype' of it opening is over. The wait has only been at the most 5-10 minutes, for them to get us a high chair and make sure the table is extra clean. The service has been great as well. They try to check back on you and see if you need anything, if they cannot get what you are looking for they ask another waiter to help out. We didn't have any trouble with the menu and have always enjoyed the food we ordered.   The food we have gotten is always delicious and hot. Sometimes it may seem like they are taking awhile to prepare our food, but our waiter always comes and tells us that they are making sure the food is yummy. When it does come to our table, the presentation is there. They make it so all the food is reachable, since this place is fit for big families and sharing. They try to take away things that are dirty or plates that are not being used so that we can have more space for our food. The food has never been cold or sad looking. It is always yummy, the chicken is crunchy and the soup we usually get is hot, but not burning our tongues. That we can enjoy the food right when it comes. They try to refill our glasses when they see it getting empty.   OBVIOUSLY, some Filipinos are still stingy and still think this place needs all kinds of things done to it, but from my experiences and being there with my family. I enjoy the fact that we can order delicious food, sit, and enjoy our meal as a family. Without the trouble of cooking, cleaning, and doing everything else. Plus the prices aren't really that bad for all the food we get.   I ENJOY MAX'S RESTAURANT.",

It's such a rare occurrence for a waiter to come check up on you if you need any drinks or even to find a waiter on floor. I take back the whole new staff comment they just need better manager and organization on how things are run. I've come here so many times expecting a better experience and it's just lead to more disappointment. Love Filipino food tho. ALSOOOOO if you like boba that's hard in the middle aka not cooked go here.",

Right when we got in we were seated right away, the waiter came right away asking if we are ready to our looking like he was in a hurry. So we said we needed a minute so he left and right when we were ready he told us he will back so we ended up waiting 5 minutes for him to come back and get our orders.  Our orders took more than 20 minutes to come. And we only ordered three dishes. I mean, I understand it takes awhile for the food to cook. My order was pork belly sisig took forever to came he said 5 minutes but it didnt not came not until 10 minutes later.  Our waiter never came back to check up on us.  Like, NEVER not even once the waiter came back on us asking if we are still okay or if we need anything. We didnt even get a refill for our waters.  They were busy serving the big groups instead.  Me and my friends ended up waiting for him to come back to get our check and to go boxes.  It was really disappointing.",

No menu at the table and had to ask the greeter to get menu.  Waited almost another 10 minutes for the water  Server came and introduced himself, ordered a sago and lunch. I don't know if the prep work is different in the USA compared to the Philippines but it doesn't take long to pour the drink toss in the jello and tapioca ...the drink itself is really good and just like I would have back in Manila  The food itself was great...ordered garlic fried rice, half chicken and sisig  Hopefully they get it together so that the experience will match the food",

    "text": "This food reminds me of going to a good ol' Filipino backyard party and for me, that's a really cool thing.  Came here with a few good friends who knew the management and we got to meet them so overall a good experience.  ATMOSPHERE: The place is really clean, not like many other Filipino restaurants in Vegas.  The decor is really nice, very reminiscent of a Filipino house and the bar area is pretty nice.  It's not super loud inside so you can tell it's a nice, chill spot to get some good food.  I also like that they have a private area for larger parties.  FOOD:  The food is as good as it gets.  True Filipino food that I could enjoy without having to worry about extra grease or fat, even though not everything is necessarily healthy.  Our group got the \"C\" set menu which included Kare-Kare and Lechon.  Everything was cooked well and tasted True.  The fried chicken was a tiny bit dry to me, but I just added sauce to help it out.  SERVICE:  Our bartender (Heaven) was really nice and kept the bar really clean.  She also served as our server and everyone else that helped out was really nice.  The fact that many of the workers are native Filipinos shows that Max's sticks True to their roots.  No issues here whatsoever.",

My mom really wanted to come here since we don't have one in San Diego.  My family of 9 ordered the Family Set C ($185.00). THERE WAS SO MUCH FOOD. We got a whole friend chicken (already sliced), 2 garlic fried rice, 2 kare-kare, 2 pancit bihon, 2 lechon kawali. Plus we ordered pork sisig and prom bbq a la carte.   I eat a lot but there was so much food, that I didn't even touch the kare-kare.   The chicken is not the best (if you compare it to other American fried chicken places like Popeyes or Church's). But, this was the chicken a lot of Filipinos grew up eating and it brings nostalgic feelings.  I would say my favorite would be the pork bbq. They definitely stuffed each stick with so much meat and it had a sweet flavor.   Service was pretty fast too. We ordered right away and the servers came with our drinks and food within 15 mins.",

Known as \"the house that fried chicken built\". My hubby said calm down okay we'll eat there lol!  Kiddos disagree noooo!!!!  They're picky but of course I won ! And we were HungryAF! Let's go!  We were lucky to wait for only 5 mins but then I noticed this eatery is always busy loved by tourists & locals (big Filipino community in Vegas).  Drinks- we all ordered mango juice it was lightly sweetened loved it. Food- the famous whole fried chicken - hmm crispy skin on the outside and tender n juicy in the inside it was perfection so tasty and flavorful. And best eaten with the famous Jufran banana ketchup (so popular in the Philippines) or you can use Worcestershire sauce. Hubby ordered the pork sour soup called sinigang but it was pretty bland. The garlic rice was a lot and it taste good.  Overall great dining experience we couldn't finish our food huge servings here. Highly recommended this place stop by when you're in Vegas .  They also offers variety of authentic Filipino dishes but fried chicken is popular must order!  The waiters are friendly and welcoming.  I can't wait for them to open Max's chicken place in San Diego area sometime soon? Definitely coming back here again one day.",

Kare Kare is my favorite along with the PINAKBET! My review is about the service! As much as I love coming to MAX's restaurant in Las Vegas, I am not too excited about the wait. Not only do you have to wait a long time to be seated, the food takes twice as long! WHY MAX? I don't need an explanation, just make a change! As we got seated, it took another five minutes (YES I timed it! I'm big on being greeted) before someone came to our table only because I asked who our server was. So my KUDO's goes out to GERALDINE and APPLE! I swear Geraldine had more table than the other servers by our observation, and Apple will come out to serve the food once ready! And she took the time to say hello and greeted her customers.  Although they were busy, these two ladies maintained a very pleasant attitude! Geraldine was so kind to us and allowed me to order in advance while we were waiting for our parents to arrive. So I wanted to make sure that Geraldine and Apple gets major props for their quality customer service! But dang Max... do something about the wait time... Salamat! Thank  you! Mahalo!",

This is of my ignorance. It was a good dish.",

    "text": "Great place to eat. I liked the setup since it was fairly roomy. Food was good as we ordered a few things such as their kare-kare, bulalo, chicharron bulaklak, their famous chicken, and their pork bbq skewers which was surprisingly big. Loved their kare-kare. The chicharron was not very crispy. Didn't taste the chicken since I mainly focused on my main course I ordered for myself which is the kare-kare. Skewers tasted good and their bulalo was also good since the meat was very tender. Gave it a 4 star since the service was a tad bit slow. There was not much people in there so I don't know why the waiters looked flustered. I had to call different waiters a few times just to get the check, napkins, and boxes since they didn't check on us much. Maybe it was just a bad night for them so who knows.  Aside from that one thing everything else was great.",

We were a group of 6 people, and it was more than enough. Great atmosphere and kid friendly. Out of all the Max's in the U.S. this one in Las Vegas is the only 1 of 2 that are family owned.

However, the wait to get our food felt really long. I really did not like the fact that they did not build our order, they simply brought our food almost one by one. Our sizzling pork sisig came first and the others took a couple more minutes to get to our table. By the time the rest of the food came the sisig was not hot anymore. I was also very disappointed with the pancit canton. It was very watery and and it lacked flavor. The only good food that we ordered was the chicken everything else was just eh ok.   I know opening a restaurant is tough but come on you are in Vegas and just a few minutes from the strip! I am giving this place 3 stars just because it's Max's Restaurant. If I was not familiar with the brand I would give this place a 1.5 because I know they could do a lot better.   Tips: - Train all of your staff according to industry standards. - The kitchen needs to run quicker. - The servers needs to learn how to juggle their tables better. - The food needs better flavors (it lacks a lot of flavor). - Build the orders (don't just bring out one dish but bring them all together). - Please please please train each and every single employee better.",

    "text": "Two days ago is when I went on my first isit. My mom LOVED max's original in the Philippines. And it's right down the street from the biggest Asian market. So we thought hey, lets not try it.  The best fresh Lumpia I have ever had!  Probably the only thing I would go back for. They are very expensive, not worth the food.  We got, Fresh Lumpia, Kare Kare, Crab Fried Rice, Lechon Kawali, Whole Fried Chicken and Palabok.  First glance, I really like the atmosphere. Love the fire place, place mats, the table, chairs, separated rooms for more intimate settings. And it has a full bar.  It's not really wheel chair accessible in the dinning area. And quite big.  The service was great at first. She was chipper, smiling, she knew how to pronounce the food correctly, she knew what to pair each dish with, or suggest the most common pair. Until a few more people came in, then it was a whole different story. I felt like she had a short attention span. Which isn't bad don't get me wrong. Or a bad short term memory. None of which is her fault. But I have both of those, and I wasn't that bad. I would be running around like a little chicken just so I wouldn't forget. Even carry things in my apron. I don't remember if they had pockets. But either way.  Food came out to be $80+, I can cook all of what we got for around the same price. Seriously?  The chicken was dry. Great coating. But covered in salt. Especially the fries.  Lechon Kawali seemed old, over cooked, and not cooked in the right way. Palabok. didn't taste like anything and was not worth the calories, more than one bite. And MAN do I love food.  Crab fried rice was delicious, but again with the salt. Could of made it at home.  Kare Kare was bland. Oxtail wasn't very fond of. And Oxtail is probably my favorite in the meat department. I'm happy they didn't put tripe in it. Could have better veggies too.    Needs more and better desserts.   If they had better food, prices and service. I would LOVE to have a birthday or some type of celebration there.   I would love to find and buy the serving dishes.  If they didn't have such a great restaurant decor, it'd be a one.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place because I had never really had Filipino food besides Jollibee's fried chicken. We came here for an early dinner and overall I thought it was pretty good, although it is really overpriced for the small amount of food you get and the service was a little lacking.  Because I had only had fried chicken before that was my immediate go-to, especially because I heard that Max's is famous for their fried chicken. I went with a half fried chicken dinner and Tapsilog, which was a breakfast dish with strips of steak, garlic rice and eggs. I thought the food was really good, but I really have nothing to compare it to so I have no idea if it was authentic or not. If you ask Rachel S, she'll tell you it was so-so and that she's had better. I liked that the steak and rice had a light garlic flavor and that the fried chicken was crispy and juicy. What I didn't like was the price in relation to the small portions received. I mean, what kind of chicken are they frying up here? Cornish game hens? A 2 piece at Popeyes would've been more food than the half chicken they were selling here for $11.99!  Service was also medicore at best...when we needed something it took us a while to flag down the waiter if we even saw him at all. Also there is a window where you can see into the kitchen and our whole meal we saw them running around with a fly swatter and checking the walls inside the kitchen...that made us a little uneasy...the health inspector might need to make a surprise visit here very soon lol.",

    "text": "Did the recipe for the chicken change? I haven't eaten at Max's for over a decade and I was really disappointed, in the chicken. The chicken just didn't taste the same to me. Is it wrong to say it tasted to clean? I was craving the deep fried oily chicken. Not to say what I got wasn't good, it just wasn't what I expected. So, did the recipe change? Or did I just expect to much? I am a huge fan of the chicharon bulaklak it was SO SO SO SO SO (I want to add more SO's but I wont) good! Only downfall is that I burped chicharon bulaklak all day. But it was worth it, so worth it. Not to oily and it was the perfect crispiness. Not only was that good but so was the lechon kawali sisig. Each bite was flavory delicious. I know its going to be hard, but make sure you don't eat it all because eating it the next day was even better than eating it at the restaurant. Its like eating cold pizza but better becaue its sisig. Eating for lunch the next day, I wish I had more. I was like why does this taste way better than in the restaurant! Well, duh its because the flavor was able to sit for the night and at the restaurant they make everything fresh, or so they say.  With the good, there's the bad. The lumpia, was the bad. I've never really been a fan of lumpia but I was super hungry and literally ordered everything. I shouldn't have ordered this. I mean thumbs up for having the lumpia in a cute lumpia holder but thumbs down because it didn't taste cooked enough.  More bad, yes, unless you like your adobo sweet, which then disregard the my adobo review. EW. who likes their adobo sweet? BARF, not me. The adobo was like I said sweet, and the texture was a bit weird, like thick. anyway YUCK. That's my review.  What else did we order. Did I mention there was only 2 of us. Disclaimer we were super hungry so ordered a lot.  Oh, the pancit canton, skip it. I'm over writing and its not worth it.  Lastly, don't forget to get some of those caramel bars. YUM. Wait, not lastly. We also shared the Buko Pandan, make sure you leave room for dessert. THIS STUFF IS BOMB. I wish I didn't eat so much bulaklak, if I didn't I would have ordered my own buko pandan.  So, to summarize my review do order the bulaklak, but don't eat too much so you have room for the buko pandan.",

I had read on Yelp that they had silogs (Filipino breaky with garlic fried rice, fried egg, and your choice of meat) all day.....that most def sealed the deal in having lunch there since we were at Toys R'Us.  We entered when they had just opened at 11/1130am, and it surprisingly had 4 tables already filled.  I, immediately, asked about their silog selections because I was craving a milkfish silog and our waiter said they \"didn't have that anymore!\" SAD.FACE. I was hella bummed. BF looked at me like I was crazy cuz, as he said it: there's other good food to order!  Alas, he was right and we ordered the garlic fried rice, pork belly sisig, and he got a lunch special with the fried chicken, garlic rice, and pancit.   Being the foodie that he is, he said that the fried chicken here is his favorite! That's a pretty big deal. He loved its moist chicken meat and crispy and NOT AT ALL OILY chicken skin. Not the kind of chicken from KFC or Popeye's for sure.  The garlic fried rice was Guud....the kind of good that reminds me of my mom's garlic fried rice; like homecooking at a restaurant, if that's possible. The pork belly sisig was very good, especially with some freshly squeezed lime/calamansi juice on it. I just wish it was a little more spicy, like that of Cafe Moda's sisig ---- although this in no way is comparable to Cafe Moda's sisig in my mind.  We left happy, full, and even with some leftovers.  Service was good considering I was expecting a lack there of from reading some Yelp reviews.",

    "text": "I've been to Max's about 10 times, 8 of them being before they even opened up. It's located in the old Lone Star Steakhouse standing alone between an Albertson's and Chevron. You can't miss it.  The interior is very nice, certainly nicer than any Filipino restaurant I've been too. It's fancy like Vegas but not so cause there's no go go dancers. There's lots of seating and a bar.  I did some research before coming and noticed Max's is known for their fried chicken and halo halo. I had the whole fried chicken dinner with two sides, some slaw and fries. The chicken was kind of disappointing. It wasn't meaty, juicy, or crispy. It was tiny for the price but had some good flavors, potential to being good. The slaw and fries were basic nothing special. I'll try the chicken again just cause it's what they're banking on plus it was their 1st day.  The halo halo was good then again can you really screws up halo halo. For those who haven't had halo halo it's a cold dessert made up of shaved ice, evaporated milk, various beans, fruits, and fruit preserves. Sometimes there's ube ice cream which Max's does.  They serve other Filipino food at pretty reasonable prices. The customer service is very friendly. Let them make their \"special sauce\" they get a kick of making it for you. I think it was nothing but banana ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and something else, it was alright. I'd probably come back.",

    "text": "I will begin by saying that I am Filipino.  And this is my first time in Las Vegas and at a Max's.  I was very excited to try it out when I looked at the menu.    My party of three got there and were promptly seated.  We ordered our food and that was literally the last time we saw our waitress until the end, which I'll get more into later.  We are eating and don't get me wrong, the food is good.   We also ordered three buko juices and three waters.  Funny, the buko juice comes out, but not the water.  No big deal right?  Our waitress will come out and bring it.  It's only water.  However, out waitress does not come to check on us. There are no other wait staff in sight.  So I go the hostess and explain that we were waiting on our waters because we finished the buko juices and were thirsty.  The hostess then goes to the back and 10 minutes later says she informed our waitress.  She doesn't do the reasonable thing and bring the waters herself.  OK...fine.  10 minutes pass and I begin to wonder if they're cooking the water.  another 5 minutes and another waiter brings us 2 waters.  We kindly explain there are three of us, and so he brings us another water, but this time, only took 3 minutes (yes, I began timing a while ago).    At this point, we are all pretty upset.  Another 10 minutes of us not eating go by and we are wondering if our check will be delivered.  Another 10 minutes goes by, all the while, the hostess, to whom we sat a mere tablelength away, does nothing.  So I strand and ask her for the check.  She hurries to the waiter and he sees me standing, coat on, ready to go, and asks if we want dessert.  Inside, my blood boils, outside, my face contorts and I ever so restraintfully say \"just the check.\"  Mind you, there is a family behind us celebrating a kid's birthday, so I am not about to go and ruin their evening because wait staff is not good at the only thing they are hired to do...wait.    My two companions go to the car because they are so upset and I, standing at the hostess' table, trying to pay the bill, explain our frustration.  The waitress, who earlier disappeared,must've seen our table was empty and came back out to the hostess' table and sees me and says in Tagalog that she's got something to do in the kitchen and runs back once she sees me.  The only thing the hostess can say is that they only had one server that night and she's sorry.     Though the food was very good, the staff and service are terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  So much so that I refuse to go to another Max's again and will inform all my friends and family of this experience.  Also, I will be calling the manager tomorrow to explain to him/her our experience.    If I could rate lower, I would.",

    "text": "Do not get the chicken soup and the set menu!  My family dined here New Years Day. Don't know why of all the nice restaurants in Vegas, we picked Max.  Anyway, we decided on the set menu A and 3 orders of the fresh lumpia. It also comes with soda. There were 9 of us dining. Here my review of the set menu items:  All items were brought one at a time and slow. We finished each dish before the others came out.  Chicken Soup - The most disgusting, salty, no flavor soup. Seems like they threw canned stuff in a pot and canned broth. Nasty!  How this even passed as part of the menu is beyond reason. Manager! I'm calling you out! Please taste this nasty soup. I would not feed this to my dogs!  Fresh Lumpia - Veggies were cold. As in they took it out if the fridge and poured the sauce over it.  Fried lumpiang Shanghai - could not taste the meat Garlic Fried Rice - Too mooshy. This is supposed to be dry. Hello Fried Rice! Bistek -  Taste was ok but they used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce. Beef is low grade with too much cartilage Bihon Pancit - lacked the veggies and meat. This too was wet noodles. Not supposed to be wet Chicken - this is the only dish we enjoyed. But we were already full.  Calamsi Juice - Artificial Taste concentrated nasty! Buko Juice - worst than Zico coconut juice coconut meat was nasty  Overall I would not dine here ever again unless I was dying for some fried chicken.  If I do I'll take it to go. But then my wife can make the same chicken. She just buys the Costco rotisserie chicken cuts it up and fries it. Better than Max.   Never again!  I was not going to give it a star but it would not let me go forward.",

    "text": "Max. Max. Max. Max. Bout damn time you opened up only for me to find out that you still have a lot of kinks to work out based on reviews and word of mouth. So I was thinking  a couple months should give you enough time to get your S***T together.  Fast forward to Monday, January 6th. 7 pm dinner time. 8 of us show up and are seated in a timely manner. So far, service seems legit.  We ordered Garlic Fried Rice, Lechon Kawali, Sizziling Tofu, Chicken Sisig, Pakbet, Sinigang na Baboy, Fried Bangus, and of course, Max's Fried Chicken! We ended our feast with Buko Pandan and Halo-Halo for dessert.  We got our food rather quickly. Again, service seems very good. It was not until we got all our food that the I noticed our server disappeared. We were enjoying our food but was wondering when we were going to get refills on all our drinks. We also wanted to order dessert. I would say we did not see our server for a good 15 minutes. We ended up flagging another server to find out where our server was.   So he finally comes back to attend to our needs. As I told him that we needed refills and to order dessert, I smell the strong odor of cigarette smoke all over him and his breath as he acknowledged our needs. DUDE! Now we know where he has been. He obviously was on his break smoking. Pop a breath mint or 20. I hope he at least washed his hands. Memo to upper management or whoever is in charge of hiring and training your servers, either you need to do a better job of keeping an eye on your employees or hire better servers! I mean, when somebody goes on break, someone else is supposed to cover temporarily until that person comes back.   So we get our refills finally and our desserts. At this point, I just wanted to finish and pay up so we can get out of there.  Overall, I was actually impressed at the beginning until our server went on his break. It's such a shame too because the food was 4 star worthy but the service was no better than a 2. So this is where I can justify my rating of 3 at this point in time. Maybe in another couple months or whenever I feel that enough time has passed for you big wigs to finally pay attention to these reviews that have a common theme and actually do something about it, until then I predict your average will not go any higher than a 3.

    "text": "Finally!! This has been a bookmark for quite some time months before their opening.  In fact, Yelp Las Vegas even has a Talk Thread about Max's Restaurant (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/topic/north-las-vegas-halo-halo-and-maxs\">yelp.com/topic/north-las...</a>).  What's all the hype...it's suppose to be Filipino food at its finest.  I've had their popular crispy chicken before.  And what I can remember, it was crunchy, greasy, and yet, it was still tasty.  Fast forward to now, the chicken is still greasy, still crunchy, and still tasty.    My Thoughts: -The Restaurant:  I know it's a new Restaurant and is suppose to be clean.  Guess what? It was was.  I was actually impressed with the size, decor, spaciousness, and cleanliness.  I don't remember a Max's being this clean.  Max's of Manila in Las Vegas is a change  -Ambiance:  Comfortable, for me at least.  I would say it was 99.2% Filipino.  Make that 99.9% after Terri R and I arrived. It's their soft opening, so busy they were.  The mood was fast paced once you finally get your food.  As soon as you leave, they fill your vacant tables.  Lines, lines, and more lines.  Customer were coming from all over.  You even notice this from the parking lot with all the NV plates, CA plates, and rental cars. The wait for us was suppose to be 40 minutes, but we ended up being seated just 15 minutes later.  NOTE:  This can still seem like an eternity if you're hungry like a madman.   -Service:  Not at their finest.  Once seated, we waited patiently, then impatiently for a long 15 minutes.  Keep in mind, this is just to get our orders taken and your drinks filled.  Max's is Filipino and their service is definitely on \"Filipino Time\".    -The Food (Max's Budget):  Like I stated earlier, their chicken hasn't changed over the years.  I ended up with their Max's Budget, which consisted of a leg quarter of Max's full chicken, 3 baby pieces of Shanghai Lumpia, a cup of white rice, and Caramel Bar.  The chicken had a lot of meat and was tasty.  The chicken was also greasy.  I use to be a fan of this type of chicken.  Not anymore.  But I can't complain about it because this is how they set for their fried chicken to taste like.  My mom's fried chicken is even made this way.  Geez, my family parties even have chicken made this way.  In other words...comfort \"Food for You\".  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=k0PIF3xHTbBa16EtRCe3yg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  -The Food (Max's Teaser):  I also ordered the Max's Teaser, which is their Calamari, Fries, and Shanghai Lumpia.  I don't eat fried foods much anymore and only got this to taste test.  I was disappointed with this order because it was skimped to the Max (pun intended). I felt disgusted after killing the whole plate.  Yes, I had to deMELish this but it didn't take much because I didn't get much.  I don't want to sound \"kuripot\" and I get it...it's called Max's Teaser for a reason.  They just teased me and ganked me with baby portions. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qm-sSyuKcJ-aYusyMZqMnQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  -Price:  I'm mixed here because Terri's Kare Kare looked hooked up, my main meal's portion was average, and the Teaser was lacking everything.  But if you need to know, dinner for two with an appetizer only cost $33.  I guess that's not bad at all.  Overall, it would take a little more for me to give this place 5 stars because they are not \"As good as it gets\".  It's also tough for me to give them less then 4 stars because Max's Las Vegas is how I remember them and exactly what they aim to be...that's comfort Filipino food and served at a \"Filipino Time\" pace.  I'm sure I will be back because my out-of-town friends and family are fans. I'm sure they'll want to come here when they visit.   PS:  I thought the artwork on their paper place mats were a little interesting. These are just some of the things you notice when you're waiting to be served.

    "text": "Warning: this is a bad review and I don't intend to pull any punches. I was visiting Vegas over Memorial Day weekend and searched for Filipino restaurants in town without ready made food on steam tables. Options were limited and it seems many places have closed down so Max's is one of the only local options available to Filipinos in the area. This lack of local competition really shows in the operation and upkeep of this restaurant. I am from Southern California and I know what it looks like when Filipino restaurants have their shit together and when other ones just operate on good intentions and wishful thinking. I have also have eaten at Max's in the Philippines and in California. I chose to eat at this location because I was hoping for the reliability and consistency one can and should expect from an international chain. Frankly, this site was disappointing to say the least and I think it's a real letdown for the local Filipino community who have such few options. Take some pride in your work as local representatives of your culture! First of all, clean up the mess on the ramp outside. There was garbage on the railing outside -cartons and even beer cans. The rest of the neighborhood may look like it's gone to shit, but your place shouldn't reflect that. Secondly, there is no clear managerial hierarchy there (that the employees fear/respect). We were seated and clearly wanted to order, but no one came. Someone eventually stepped up as if he were the manager, but I also noticed that he was spread thin doing menial tasks others should be doing. Meanwhile there are just too many people hanging around, hands empty with nothing to do. As a manager, that is a red flag that means some people need to get fired to make room for the hard working staff to collect the tips they deserve. While we were waiting around 6PM for some serious attention, I noticed a gathering of four male staff enjoying each other's company and wrapping silverware in napkins. What does that say about time management and task assignment if four guys are sitting around, chatting, and wrapping napkins during the dinner rush? That is a one man job to be done before lunchtime or between lunch and dinner. \"Manager\" guy says their shifts are already over. What does that say that they're hanging about \"after work\"? There were also three staff chilling out at the front desk. Too much congregating and fraternizing. Meanwhile, you have my famished wife and diabetic father waiting to order, but the place settings weren't even on the table before we were seated. The guy that we thought was our waiter was bussing the table next to us. The table next to us was clearly annoyed because they wanted to leave after their meal, but couldn't. However, the bill holder for their table somehow on our table. Honestly, in my opinion observing the social dynamic, the restaurant needs to hire some competent female staff on the floor that will intimidate the male staff into not wanting to look inadequate. I'm no feminist, but I'm also familiar with how things fall apart when you've got a boy's club that doesn't see the need to take work seriously. You'll achieve better efficiency when people are assigned specific tasks they are solely responsible for instead of this communal accountability so very few restaurants can pull off. Your local pinoys are hardworking people and they deserve good service! BTW, everyone at our table agreed that the sinigang was too sour.",

    "text": "I've been anxiously waiting for Max's to open since when they said they were going to open back in August. My family and I went here at 6pm and there was a bunch of Filipinos waiting outside...oh no! We were told there was a 40-minute wait so my sister asked how long it would take for a to-go order: 30 minutes. We stood outside and 10 minutes later, our table was ready. Everyone's lolo/lola, tito/tita, ate/kuya and barkada/kaibigan were here.   My parents would take us to Max's back in Manila when I was little. I liked their chicken a lot that my mom copied their recipe and she got it right. You can't come here and not get chicken and dip it in Jufran banana ketchup.    We got Max's Budget, Max's Fiesta Plate, calamansi juice, a bangus and halo-halo.  Max's Budget: Fried chicken leg, rice/fries, lumpiang Shanghai (egg rolls with meat) and a caramel bar. I've said this before and I'll say it again...I don't eat rice. But if I do, I always get garlic rice. The chicken was on the salty side and that's not how Max's does their chicken. My lumpia was burnt and super oily. I like the caramel bar. 3/5   Max's Fiesta Plate:  My sister and bro-in-law both got fried chicken leg, garlic rice, lumpiang ubod (fresh lumpia with heart of palm) and caramel bar. The lumpia wrapper was a bit thick but the filling was delicious. 4/5  Daing na Bangus: Pronounced \"dah-eeng na bang-oos\" not \"bang us\"...mmkay? Or just ask for the fried milkfish. Milkfish marinated in vinegar and garlic then fried. Dip in vinegar and eat with garlic rice. Yum! 5/5  Halo-halo: Shaved ice with kaong, nata de coco, ube, flan, beans, coconut shreds topped with ube ice cream sprinkled with pinipig. The ice to topping ratio was great. Most places will you lots of ice and less toppings. Max's has more toppings than ice and their ice is finer than the ones I've had here in Vegas. The pinipig was great and most places in Vegas  skip it and I don't know why. Sarap!!! 5/5    There are still kinks to be worked on and I understand since it's only their soft opening. Wet plates from the washer. Our food came an hour after placing our order. The chicken was a bit saltier than other Max's I've been to. My halo-halo went to the wrong table. There's still room for improvement and I'll come back after a few months.  Filipino 101: Where is da C.R.? = where is the bathroom? Sarap = delicious",

Other guest were very upset they were there before the party I came with and been waiting an hour. They do not seat people by first come first serve but what tables are available this was explained by a hostess. I do understand this this is a \"NEW\" establishment with a SOFT OPENING but truly they are a franchise from the Philippines what is the difference in how to run a new restaurant in the States?! I just could not get it. When you visit a Jollibee in the PI and here to me it seems to run smoothly. All the servers and hostess were nice and friendly.   So our dinner went like this: Didn't have trouble finding parking walked to the front a lot of people waiting finally they called are name for a party of 3. Got sat in booth area. Jaki waitress comes and asks what we wanted to drink just water all around for now....Water came in 10 minutes after having to hunt her down and asked for the water again. We caught up with Jaki when she took the order from the table next to us then we immediately ordered but no Pancit Palabok no pork sisig..so what now? She recommended the pancit canton and chicken sisig..ok we will get that they did have the chicken ordered that too..order comes around chicken ok, chicken sisig had mayo on it no vinegar taste not even sizzling on the hot plate, pancit tasted like an instant batch you can buy and make yourself. Got the check after hunting her down again then I didn't see her for another 15 min...15 min to run a card? wow found the MGR took him 5 min to go back there total 20 min to check out of here.  I'm not asking for high top notch service but timely service I at least expected some good Filipino food. Try it for yourself if you dare!",

I thought that was pretty neat.  Service was pretty quick and the food was tasty.  The only thing keeping this from a 5-star rating was the cost for liquor.  I ordered a Captain Morgan (rum) and Diet Pepsi (no Coke products).  My jaw nearly hit the floor when I saw the charge on the bill...$13.  I'd go here again, but I think I'll stick to beer if I drink.",

    "text": "This restaurant has been open a couple of months, and there should be no excuses for unforgettably lousy service.  The servers were friendly, but do they know what customer service really means?  I came with a friend, and we were both born and grew up in the Philippines.  My parents are from Bulacan and my friend is from Pampanga, and we know good food.  The service:  We waited for about 20 minutes after we were seated, and we had to call someone to complain.  We were told someone would be coming, and we waited another 10 minutes.  We had to flag someone down again.  Finally, someone took the order, and we told him we wanted only water to go with the dishes we ordered.  The water did not come.  Another guy came by to ask what we were drinking, and I said water.  The water still did not come.  So we complained again.  I guess they don't like it when they have to serve only water for drinks which means no tips based on zero price.  So the water finally was served.  About 5 minutes later, the food was finally served.  We felt hurried through dinner since the staff was going to prepare for their own Christmas party that night at the restaurant.  One of them kept wanting to take away the plates even though they still had food in them.  Some of the staff came to our table and were apologetic, but do apologies erase a bad taste in your mouth?  The food:  We ordered the fried chicken, lumpiang sariwa, sinigang na baboy, and halo-halo.  My friend liked the chicken, it was just ordinary for me.  The lumpia was okay, not garlicky the way I like it.  The sinigang na baboy was not sour the way sinigang should be, and not plentiful enough for what they charged.  The halo-halo was average and did not have a lot of ingredients.  I felt like I could have done better at one of the Filipino turo-turo food stores in town.  The ambiance:  How come the bar does not have chairs around it so if people want to hang out, they can sit at the bar?  We were catching a cold draft from where we were sitting, so I stood up to check on the windows and see if the empty tables were warmer.  I put my fleece jacket back on after which an assistant manager type went to the thermostat after a few minutes and adjusted the temperature.  There were empty tables that were not cleaned for a while, it was a Tuesday night and was not really busy, so that really looked terrible.  I celebrated one of my birthdays at Max's in the Philippines back then, and I have good memories from it.  This recent experience at Max's in Las Vegas, sad to say, was memorably bad, and I will not return, nor will I tell my friends that there is a Max's in town.  There is just too much competition in Las Vegas now for great food, and when I want Filipino food, I'll just go to a turo-turo.",

We frequent the Glendale location and wanted to see if this new store measured up to the one in Glendale. We were pleasantly surprised with the ambiance (sosyal,) love the feel of the place. We went in for merienda so that meant fresh lumpia, palabok, halo-halo, and squeezed in their famous chicken. I have to say \"they've got the best chicken!!!\" The halo-halo is to die for (love the little umbrella.) Service was fast and friendly. Our server was on top of everything, we didn't have to look for him to refill our drinks. Von checked on us frequently and made sure we had a pleasant meal. While walking in the door we said \"Let's see if this place is as good as Glendale.\" Leaving we thought to ourselves \"This is the new standard!\" The kitchen, servers, and management are on point. These guys are in the ZONE. Will definitely be back soon for the chicken and awesome service. Keep up the good work!!!",

Food aside, an incident took place today where one of my parents friend slipped on the floor due to the negligence of the restaurant. Mind you he was a 70 yr old man. He had slipped on some noodles (pancit). Right away we asked for the manager instead we got Von, the supervisor. Right away he was not professional about the situation and did not know what to do. He just asked for the identification card of our friend that had fallen, gave ice and towels and just went back to waiting tables. No incident report!? What kind of establishment is this!? To add salt to the wound only two halo halo desserts were comp and not the whole meal!!! C'mon now, that's just ridiculous!!! Our friend had to go to urgent care and we had to go back to this restaurant to confirm that our friend was not going to be billed by the hospital and it was the restaurant fully liable. We had to talk to the manager and to make a long story short at this point we waited over an hour and half. It was very frustrating to have some kind of copy stating the restaurant was liable for this accident. The manager kept insisting that everything is done verbal per company policy. Our friend is okay to say at least. This restaurant has been a nightmare to deal with!!!",

    "text": "I'll be the first to admit that Filipino food is a bit foreign to me, in that I've tried it a few times and liked it, but I have no idea what the dishes actually are. I imagine most visits to Max's are pretty similar, as their menu favors a family-style format where you basically grab and eat whatever's closest. A couple of recent visits here helped me get to know what I was eating.  For intro-level Filipino food, snag some fried lumpia (spring rolls), chicken adobo, super-crispy fried chicken (ask for banana ketchup), and their salt or garlic rices. The grilled beef skewers are a must-get item for me, but pinkabet (vegetable stew), kare-kare (peanut butter-based sauce), and inasal (grilled chicken) are other dishes I can safely get here without risking the rage of my cardiologist. Ease into that side of the cuisine with dishes like lechon kawali, crispy pata, and lechon sisig. If you have room left, finish up with the confusingly tasty halo-halo (a wild mix of textures and a giant scoop of ube ice cream) or the slightly-tamer Buko Pandan (green jelly with coconut ice cream).   Though I usually prefer to go to smaller local Filipino places (or friends' houses) when I want to eat these dishes, I really appreciate that the food here is not as greasy as other places, which is a huge part of what tips this into the four-star category for me.  TIP: They recently added single-serving bowls of some of their best entrees for weekday lunches, so now you don't have to round up a whole herd of friends to get your fix.",

Tonight we were attended by Kirt and he gave us great service. Our order was made without an excessive wait.  The lumpia appetizer was devoured by my little girls, wife and I. I didn't really care for the sauce, but the cabbage and atsara added to the flavor. We ordered crab fried rice. The fried rice was subtle, but as soon as I had the crab and egg, it changed and enhanced the flavor, no salt or pepper needed. You can never go wrong with the fried chicken, laing, or chop suey. Last but not least, I had kare kare. At first, I told my wife I could get used to the stew, and her reply was to add the bagoong. No joke, this changed the dynamic of the food in a way that I could not get over.   All in all, we have always had positive experiences and we look forward to coming back on our next trip out. Thank you for taking care of my family and I.",

The restaurant wasn't empty when I arrived. We got seated right away.  Customer Service (10/10) They always checked up on our table to make sure we were doing fine & came to refill our water when it was empty. They were super friendly also!  Food (9/10) We ordered the Max's fried chicken, beef sinigang, pork sisig & Buko pandan. The fried chicken was amazing! The chicken skin had the most perfect crisp. This is what they are known for so I highly suggest the fried chicken. The beef sinigang was extra tangy. I honestly prefer it to be a balance between tangy & savory. But sinigang's are supposed to be more of a tangy soup. My boyfriend really loves the sinigang soup from here tho! The pork sisig was served on a sizzling plate!! Just the way it's meant to be. But it lacked some flavor... maybe a bit more seasoning would've helped the dish. The buko pandan is to die for!!! I recommend this dessert. I love the buko pandan from Max's. It's probably the main reason why I come.  Overall it was an enjoyable experience. I'll be coming back for sure!",

We wanted Filipino food but didn't want to leave the hotel because it's super freezing outside and with my grandmother, we didn't want to make that trip. So I called and asked if they delivered and was pleased to hear that they deliver through 3 different apps. We ordered through UberEats.   We spent about $120 with the delivery fee being $3.99. Great.   Our food was delivered and I noticed that it didn't look right. I asked the driver, \"that's it?\" And he confirmed. Practically more than half of our items were missing, probably worth $70 of the entire order.   Food was unsatisfactory and just disappointing.   Won't be ordering from here again.",

    "text": "I've always liked Max's, even back in Manila.   This time around we ordered fried and fresh lumpia, kare kare, inasal, bangus, and of course, the signature chicken. Except...service was sooo bad! The servers were nice but we did not seem to have a designated one. From our drinks - all of us were given ours except for the one who only had water. We asked 4 times, by the time they gave it, we all had finished our first drink. The lumpia as an appetizer was served quickly. Promising, right, but after that, the table behind us who arrived after us had their food before we did. After the lumpia, we were told there was no more bangus. How could that be since we were there at opening time (11 am) when only three tables were occupied but okay and they suggested tilapia fillet in black bean sauce. Our food came one dish at a time with long waits in between.  Server comes and retracts the bangus issue and serves it.  We finished almost everything when we remembered - where's the signature fried chicken??? Wait some more. Meantime, we were given bowls for halo halo. We said okay but we hadn't ordered that yet. Chicken comes. The bowls were recalled and given to the another table where the halo halo had arrived. Good thing we hadn't used the bowls or spoons (or had we?, I don't know). All in all, our out of town guest conceded it was her fault for wanting to go there but said - \"in fairness, the food tastes good\". I guess, but we locals know better.  I suggest more training for the manager in charge of the servers!",

    "text": "It breaks my heart to write this but here it goes.  Let me start off this review by stating that I made reservations for my mom's birthday a month in advance on Open Table. Max's was available for reservation on the website so I thought that meant my group of 8 was set. However when we arrived and I informed them of my reservation, the front host informed us they don't check their online reservations (even though Open Table told me later they've had this option since 2015) and even if they did, they don't honor it during their \"busy\" times. I informed them that any other night I wouldn't have minded the wait, however I made this reservation far in advance and it was my mom's bday that day, and they drove 6 hours from California without stopping to grab a meal since we were supposed to have dinner here. I told them I made the reservation online, showed them proof that in fact their restaurant had reservations available on Open Table (which they should know about since you ask the website to be put on there), and the host looked confused as ever. After what felt like a long time discussing with the host who said she'll speak to her manager and with another host, I finally just begged them to see if they can set up a makeshift table for our group since we were hungry and had no other plan B that accommodates our large party that late. When the male host returned telling us they're getting a table ready, the original female host pulled him aside and told him that they really should prioritize the other people waiting. That frustrated me the most because I truly believe if you have online reservations available, you should honor it. And although it is up to the restaurant's discretion on which patrons they choose to serve, I've never heard of being turned down for having online reservations and not honoring it because they're \"busy\". Ultimately we were able to argue our way to a table at eat there but I hope no one else faces this issue. After talking to Open Table, they agreed they've never heard of such a thing as well.",

I would recommend keeping an eye out for it, if your using google maps, the restaurant is located across the street from dispensary, and next to a car wash. The restaurant is located near a bunch of stores, even Target.  Now onto to the food, upon my arrival I saw the story of how Max was born, the famous fried chicken. Naturally I had to order it to try it out. I also saw a few bowl specials. Some of them were $10 and $5 Not bad!  I decided to try out the fried rice with salted eggs, and the crispy pata. I pretty much enjoy Filipino food and Max's restaurant knows how to step it up, the food was delicious. I loved the salted egg fried rice, it was the best the flavors and the eggs really nailed it. I also thought the crispy pata was cooked perfectly and had a good crunch with flavor- it paired nicely with the salted egg fried rice.  I can't wait to come back and try more dishes.",

However, the quality of the food could not make up for the glaring weaknesses in customer service.   We went on a day where there happened to be a party going on which took up half the restaurant. In this situation some delays are completely understandable but we were left waiting for approximately an hour and fifteen minutes. There was no one at the front of the desk and several families of potential customers came and left, frustrated by the lack of coordination and employee presence as one employee popped in and out of the front desk to hand out take out orders and occasionally jot people names down to await seating. As we waited we clearly saw several booths and tables that were vacant, and there did not seem to be anyone ensuring that these tables were assigned to waiting customers. I understand booking parties is likely an important revenue source for this restaurant but the fact that the party took complete priority over regular customers is absolutely unacceptable.   Once seated, our waiter was very kind and apologetic and got our food to us as fast as possible, apologizing several times for the delay. This leads me to think that the restaurant is insufficiently staffed or poorly managed. If you can't keep private parties running smoothly while continuing regular operations, should you really be doing both?",

Service has a tremendous improvement compared to the time when they have just opened.   One huge improvement that their staff need is to NEVER assume that every single person that will dine here speaks Tagalog. I am perfectly fluent in Tagalog but I was obviously here with two people who speaks zero Tagalog and it was very obvious throughout our whole conversation BUT our server keeps talking to all of us in Tagalog even when I already told him that I am the only Filipino in the crew and even though I keep responding to all of his Tagalog questions in English just so we don't sound rude in front of my friends.   Other than that, this place will give you a good Filipino fine dining experience at very decent prices. I've been to almost every Filipino place in the valley and with all different factors considered, I will still put Max's on top of my list.",

A few sections were closed which made no sense and it didn't seem that busy to be waiting that long. When we were seated I could clearly see why. They seemed to be understaffed with waiters but had a lot of hostesses just standing around? We waited at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged and to receive refreshments. The waiters were scrambling around to give people's their food and bills and doing everything in between. Although the staff was friendly there were too many large parties here and they just weren't able to cater to everyone dining here that day. Our food also took quite a bit of time to receive. The total time we spent here was well over 2 hours and took up my entire afternoon. After waiting what seems like an eternity to receive our food my usual tapa and eggs dish wasn't plated with the usual round pretty scrambled egg. Then again we came here a while back when they were still in the soft opening stage and maybe that's why the plating was visually more appealing. The spaghetti was lukewarm and the Bicol express tastes entirely different and better in Hawaii. We won't be returning anytime soon.",

They serve partial of your order. It's kinda awkward that one person will get their ordered meal in the same table while the rest waits for theirs for a long period of time. I never understood the method of why bother bringing partial meal for the group with individual food orders. I don't get it... It's just poor practice/service.",

We had Lumpiang Shanghai and Calamari for apps and both were awesome...For our Main Course...The \"Bistek\" was a little tough and missing a bit of calamansi flavor but the Lechon Kawali, Pancit Palabok  are great and the Kare Kare is to die for...as usual. Their whole Fried Chicken is always a winner. I also had the Lecheflan after and it was satisfying. All in all, this place is highly recommended if you don't mind paying a bit more than the other good Filipino Restaurants in town. And I also  wish they open another one closer to the Southwest side of LV soon, because I think one branch here is not enough to cater for the whole Filipino Community in LV...;-)",

WOW....45mins after ordering we havent receive anything yet and we were all starving. The people next to us said that it took an hour for them to receive their order. We were all getting pissed and decided to cancel it if theyre not going to make it a lil bit faster.I dont know what happened but after 5-10mins, our order came out...ayayaiiii,finally! They have a good food,yeah, no questions about but their SERVICE SUCKS!SO SLOW, so make sure you go hear an hour before you feel your hunger or else, u might pass out due to empty stomach!

The rating of 2 stars is more for the service and over all experience, not so much the food. We were seated in between a party of 4 and a party of about 10. The hostess shorted us 1 menu, which I guess is fine. It took about 10 minutes after being seated before the waiter acknowledged us, even though he had to practically jump over me to get to the table behind ours. After he took our order, we expected our drinks to be delivered prior to the meal. Nope. We had to ask twice for the drinks to be given to us before they finally were. The food was really good. A bit cold but overall, it was delicious. I ordered the Max's Budget meal which says it comes with Shanghai, but when the meal was given to me, there were not eggrolls on the plate. I had to ask the waited where they were and he said he had to make sure that they were included. Apparently, I knew the menu better than he did. He came back several minutes later with 4 eggrolls and said he forgot them. Service here was horrible. I hope it's b/c it was busy on the side of the restaurant I couldn't see. The food was really good though so I will probably just order take out from now on.",

My Aunt and Uncle was told there would be a 30 to 40 min wait.  I met up with them and they were still waiting.  We were finally seated and the waiter don't even know his name or if he even introduced himself,  took our order.  It seemed he wasn't paying attention or he felt he was being rushed because he kept disappearing every time we would say something.  He first asked us if we wanted some drinks, we told him what we wanted.  He then disappeared again.  Took him awhile to come back with our drinks.  We finally ordered our main dishes, took them awhile to bring us plates.  The table we were sitting at, one of the plate settings was missing a fork, but the rest of the other utensils had forks in them.  We kept asking for things, where the waiter should of checked up on us if we needed anything.  Big Fail.  We ordered Kare-Kare, Sinigang Baboy, Crispy Pata, and the famous Chicken.  I am sorry to say I was disappointed in the Kare-Kare and Crispy Pata.  The Kare-Kare had more vegetables than meat.  Fail.  The Crispy Pata wasn't crispy enough.  Failed again.  The Sinigang Baboy was good, but I've had better.  The Chicken was good, we ate that all.  The waiter not once asked us if everything was good.  Not once the waiter came by to refill our waters or drinks.  I literally had to ask the waiter to refill my drink.  Failed again.  My original drink was Pepsi, when asked to refill, it was refilled with Ice-Tea instead.  Double Fail.  Don't even bother, not worth the trip.  Even though it's still a soft opening, they need massive organization and many more to name.  I just hope they will fix these quirks before their grand opening in about a few weeks.",

We were seated by the fireplace. Next to the fireplace were two vases of lovely flowers.  We were waited on within minutes.  Our waiter was patient with us explaining the different dishes as we are Americans with no knowledge of the cuisine.  We ordered noodle soup as an appetizer, chicken and a noodle dish (which I cannot pronounce) as an entree.  The food was delicious. The chicken was tender.  My only thought is that the food was not piping hot. Other than that, I enjoyed the restaurant and the food, and will definitely return.  I see a lot of comments that service was lacking.

Wait time was over an hour, and there were empty tables that needed to be cleaned. The crew lacked teamwork. Mishaps were being discussed by the cashier and the waitress (who was pretending to be busy by wiping down the menus) which could have been discussed later with a superior maybe as an after-action report. Some of the crew were really busy but some were walking around in a daze. We ordered our drinks and our food together but it took a long time for the drinks to come and when they did, they missed a few people's orders in our table of 8. FInally, after what seemed like a long wait, our food came, not at the same time. So because we were starving, whoever got their food first already started eating.  When our food came, it was mediocre. I ordered the crab fried rice  and there were egg shells in it. The sizzling sisig was drowning in oil. The rest of the food was okay, nothing worth mentioning. The only good thing that stood out was the nilaga, which was really tasty.",

    "text": "I've dined at Max's in Glendale, Ca a few times. I was ecstatic to hear of an opening in Las Vegas. I had my mind set on eating Max's Beef Caldereta (dish served at Max's in Glendale, Ca) with Garlic Rice.  Unfortunately, its not served at this location. This location is just serving the basics.  I had the Chicken Sigsig, a Whole Chicken, Garlic Rice and the Halo-Halo.   The Chicken Sigsig lacked flavor. It tasted like mayo mixed with day old chicken and slices of jalapeno. For a better tasting Sigsig , I recommend dining at Cafe Moda.  The Whole Chicken was moist and tender. I enjoyed crunching on the crispy chicken skin. Though, I still don't know what the hype is over the chicken's flavor. My guess it lacked in this chicken.  The Garlic Rice was good.   Lastly, I ordered the Halo-Halo. Delicious! The best in all Las Vegas.  The wait staff were polite and friendly.  By the way, don't ask for water. Its tap unfiltered hard water. Ask for bottled water.  In conclusion, the food is bland and lacks authentic flavor and the menu items are over priced. I wouldn't come back for the entrees until Max's Beef Caldereta is put on the menu to try.  For now I'll continue to dine at Max's in Glendale, CA. However, I will come back for the Halo-Halo.  My recommendation for this Max's is to lower the prices (especially when the food is not that good and you are just starting out) and serve authentic food.",

This place was packed since it opened and the wait and service brings this down a star.  We tried to make reservations over the phone, not possible.  So we arrive and have to wait another 30 minutes to be seated.  That's fine.  Typical, for a new busy place.  However, once we were seated, it took about another 5-10 minutes for a server to wait on us for drinks and to ask for our orders.  The killer:  We waited over 40 minutes for our food to arrive.   After 30 minutes, I even reminded the waitress about our food, and she had to ask what we ordered again.  I'm almost positive if I didn't remind her, we may have never gotten our dinner.    What we ordered:  Max's Platter - It came with a quarter chicken (honestly I have had better tasting chicken) along with a choice of two noodles, and rice or fries.    Kare-kare - Peanut butter based dish with beef/oxtail, and veggies.   It was good but I could tell it was sitting on a counter for awhile, because it gets that solid film over the top as it cools down.   The veggies were a bit too crunchy, the beef was okay but there was not enough.    Drinks were refill-able.  The place inside was nice and clean though.  Will have to try to review it again when they have their \"grand\" opening.",

    "text": "We had my cousins birthday party this afternoon. As a chef myself, they started bringing out all the food all at once, guess what? They were all cold! Sinigang was bland, kare kare was also bland.   I'm disappointed that the name doesn't hold its reputation at all!  I understand that most of our party was 15 minutes late but still isn't an excuse to serve cold ads, bland entrees.   Its understandable that it's only a couple of months old but, management should've been prepared for such demand of this kind of chain here in Las Vegas. A town known for its culinary trends.   Also,  half of the restaurant was half full yet,  the amount of people waiting at the entrance is just ridiculous!  I strongly suggest getting things organized because that is a fire hazard with people clumped up at the door!   You should also train better bar servers/bartenders. The gentleman who had taken my drink order didn't even know what tap meant when I had asked him, what do u guys have on tap? He straight said. Sir what tap? Tap water? I'm like, WTF to that? He also did not know how to operate the POS system and how much my beverage was? Kudos to the other server who assisted the bartender.   Overall wise, I will be back. But please remind the kitchen not to be afraid of a little salt and pepper. And if your kitchen staff wants to learn how to use proper seasoning?  Let me know ? thank you.",

The food came out to be kind of pricy too, 40$ for nothing. And the young lady who answered my phone call didn't tell me that my order didn't come with rice so I didn't have any rice with my meal. What Filipino can eat food without rice?!?!?   It was my birthday and I wanted to eat some pancit; it had absolutely no flavor in it. The noodles weren't even cooked right, it looked and tasted like soggy noodles.    The fried bangus was just whatever. I had no care for it after I ate it.   Lastly, the beef steak: it was the worst tasting thing I ever had!!!!! The \"gravy\" in it was just watered down with oil and soy sauce. I'm used to beef steak having lots of yummy flavor, but it was the exact opposite.   NOT TO MENTION ALL THIS FOOD I ATE I THREW UP EVERYTHING BACK UP WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR!!!! I had the WORST upset stomach ever!! All I did was throw up my whole meal. This is the worst place to eat Filipino food. I wouldn't want anyone to come here and get sick from their food. So I hope someone else had a better experience than me because I didn't enjoy mine at all.",

    "text": "Filipino food should remain homemade.  I'm not from Las Vegas, but Fresno has Filipino restaurants too. This is the reason I never voluntarily want to eat them. The only places I ever crave are Jollibee and Chow King, but who doesn't like fried chicken and Sio Pao? Also, they're fast food places.   Max's is a nice place. The place is very clean, and looks very nice. The food on the other hand... See, Filipino food takes a lot of time for preparation, and even then they are usually made in large portions. The food couldn't possibly be made to order, besides the deep fried items though. By how fast the food is served, it is definitely pre-made, reheated, then served. That, or it is made in its simplest form to be rushed. The quality of the food just didn't hit the spot.  We did end up ordering the fried chicken, which I would have enjoyed Jollibee or Chow King over. The Lechon Kawali was good, I think it would have been better if it was fried longer, considering it was very fatty. The beef steak was just not good, in my opinion. The gravy needed some seasoning. It was just so bland. The pancit was flavorless as well. A little salt wouldn't hurt the food.  A lot of Filipinos I've met are really welcoming and nice, I would expect those same kinds of people to be working at a Filipino restaurant. Good customer service should be expected in all places of business. Our waiter seemed to get easily frustrated with having to wait on customers to decide and answering questions. Not one person checked up on us, and our drinks went totally empty. I understand things can get busy, but the place was not full, and if they weren't assisting other people, then why couldn't they at least check up on us or refill our drinks? A little bit of a smile would have been nice too, but I don't want to ask for too much. I'm just a paying customer nbd.  I feel like the point of foreign food places is to take you to that country through their food. I don't think you can get that in Filipino restaurants. At least, not the ones I've been to, including this one.  The food wasn't too bad. The quality didn't stop me from eating, and I did get some water eventually. Like I said earlier, people go to these places to be reminded of their homes in other countries. It's hard to do that if you're not putting everything into your food that makes it possible to do that.",

    "text": "Kinda pains me to write this review because I'm torn - the food was absolutely delicious, definitely 5 stars just for the food. But the service, or lack thereof, was frustrating.   Let's start with the strengths - the food. We ordered a whole Max's fried chicken, pancit canton, pinatuyong pork adobo, and garlic rice. As per usual, the fried chicken was amazing - juicy, crispy, seasoned perfectly. The pancit had tons of veggies, meat, and shrimp and was super flavorful. The adobo was a mix of sweet and savory and the pork was so tender. The garlic fried rice had lots of garlic and wasn't too greasy, as good as home made by any Filipino mom.   Now the reason for the 3 stars - the non-existent \"service.\" Our actual server came to our table a total of 3 times - once to take our order, stopped by for a second  to ask if we were good after our food was dropped off (by another server/busser), and last to give us the check. There were 2 large parties that left as we got our food, after that there were only 3 tables aside from ours so it wasn't busy. The bus boy brought us our drinks after he noticed our server hadn't brought them to us yet (he had to stop her and ask if she wanted him to get our drinks for us), we asked another busser if we could get a refill on our drink and that same busser brought us our to go boxes. We needed additional items like napkins and water but didn't bother since we couldn't get anyone, anyway. I always feel bad stopping the bussers to ask for things our server should be getting us but we really had no choice. We probably would have been there an additional 20-30 minutes if we'd waited for our actual server.   Next time we'll just order takeout.",

Even all the other dishes we ordered were delicious - and we ordered a LOT of food. :D  The main thing that I did not like from here was the service. It's like they were down a person so the main servers were running around like crazy, and it was difficult to catch their attention if you needed something (and I mean you had to constantly be on the look out for them otherwise they won't stop by your table).  Also, their chef (just assuming cause of the hat) is in the dining area talking to customers, even sitting down with them at their table. I just thought that was a little too much plus him talking to us a lot kind of bothered us cause hello- we're busy eating and talking amongst ourselves. It made us kind of uncomfortable. I feel like instead of roaming around and talking to people, he should help out the servers. Plus we caught him taking a picture of someone - talk about being kinda creepy.  So if you like good food, I suggest to order take-out from here. Otherwise the bad service will get to you by the end of your visit.",

    "text": "Ive eaten at this location and a few other locations in the past. The food is consistently good, considering this is a chain. The restaurant is clean and employees are friendly. I can't justify giving them 4 stars due to the fact that the service is just not stellar. We had our waiter completely forget what we ordered and came back to double check before he punched it in to the computers. We've had to ask for napkins, straws, our waters to be refilled etc. Once, I had to ask for lechon sauce 3 times before I received it. And I'm not fond of the fact that you have to pay for rice separately.   Now with the negatives out of the way, I can go on to the food. We have our go-to dishes, which include:   Pork sinigang: sour tamarind broth with chunks of pork, bokchoy, egg plant and string beans. I love how sour they make it and appreciate the little kick of heat with the added Serrano pepper.   Kare kare: peanut based stew with beef and oxtail, bokchoy and eggplant served with a salty shrimp paste. This is my favorite Filipino dish of all time, so I was a little disappointed that it lacked the peanut flavor I was used to.   Fried chicken: of course, what they are known for. The chicken is served with fresh fries on the side. All I have to say is, that CHICKEN SKIN though!   Lechon kawali: deep fried chunks of pork belly served with the famous Mang Tomas sauce. You can't go wrong with fried anything, especially pork.   Halo Halo: the famous Filipino dessert. They definitely don't skimp on the toppings!! One of my favorite places to get halo halo!   This is a great restaurant to have a nice meal with family or friends. And I appreciate the chef coming out and chatting with us. I would not be opposed if someone wanted to eat here again.",

    "text": "Max's is...okay. I'm Filipino and love good Filipino food that feels like home cooking. This place sounds great on paper (well...some paper. Let's not forget their partial shut down last year and their demerits), but I'm just not that impressed!   Service: Our servers were very nice and polite, but also...seemed slow and at times, gone. (Honestly, you either saw ALL the waiters at once in the dining room or none at all). Took a while to refill waters and took a while to get someone's attention. Even while cleaning the table next to us, two servers (not even ours) were just chatting about the day, cleaning a table that had been dirty for a while. I had to interject to get someone's attention since we hadn't seen our waiter in a while. (Come ON- towards the end while we were waiting for our boxes, we finally waved him down and he said the reason why he didn't give it is because he didn't want to interrupt our conversation!) Polite, but also...What?!   Food: Okay.  The menu has the classic Filipino dishes and Their signature dish is obviously their chicken, which is crispy and juicy. Agreed! A crispy thin skin with juicy meat and Seasoned fairly well. We also ordered the lechon kawali, which is always a favorite of mine. I'd say this was well done and I very much enjoyed the juicy, seasoned pork belly!  However, classic pork sinigang. Not good. My mom went here a week ago and warned me, I still got it, and yes I was disappointed. The textures were way off. Mushy, and then boney/cartilage like, and sour tasting. (There is vinegar, which is explicitly stated on the menu, but the taste could be misinterpreted as spoiled).  Pancit was pancit. Nothing special.   Dessert/drinks: Fairly good sago't gulaman. (Honestly, you cant really go wrong with it). Halo Halo was okay. Could've used a bit more inside, but good nonetheless.   Overall, service and food...it's pretty average. I think I might like the Max's in SoCal MUCHHH better. If you want good Filipino food, find the other ones around the area. (There's literally a seafood city on the same street that I can get chicken, really good pork sisig, and lechon from that's faster). I might come back to try their other stuff on their menu like the crispy pata and sinigang since it seems those have better reviews.",

Everything is overpriced. My friends and I ordered kare-kare, sinigang na baboy, whole chicken, crispy pata, bangus sisig, and bistek. Every single one of these dishes disappointed. Even the rice! It was stale and old. The crispy pata was so bony, it barely had any meat. The whole chicken consisted of 2 tiny thighs and like 4 other small pieces of meat. It doesn't even taste like authentic Filipino food anymore. Far cry from the delicious Max's Restaurant in the Philippines. Don't waste your money here. If you're craving authentic Filipino food, go to D'Pinoy Joint! Better service and even better food!",

This place has almost every traditional Filipino dish you can think of, and they're all delicious.  I highly recommend the care care, the pancit palabok, and their fried chicken.  This chicken is the best I've ever had, anywhere, bar none.    It seems that there are several reviews here that set ridiculously high expectations.  Look people, nothing will EVER compare to your own Lola's or Tita's home cooking, so judging Max's or any other Filipino restaurant to that is silly.  Filipino food is so versatile and everyone has their own style.  Max's does a fantastic job of bringing you food that everyone can relate to.  And it's all delicious!!!  We go here every time we come to Vegas.  That tradition will not change for me!",

Took them at least 20-30 minutes before they can seat us. I asked to just be seated at the bar since I was so hungry I couldn't wait any longer.  So we get seated at the bar and our server comes up to us and asks us what we would like to order. I looked at him with a blank stare and said maybe I can order if I had the menu to look at. So he grabbed us menus and didn't come back to us until like 15 minutes later. I was already losing my patience. So 15 minutes later he comes to our table and takes our order. We ordered the kare kare and lechon kawali sisig.  I was surprised that the order came out at a decent time. But the food was OMG delicious! Took me back to when I was younger and living with mom. She always would cook Filipino food. We ate all of the kare kare it was a good serving for at least 2 people. The sisig was good too but I was more focused on the kare kare. lol.  Our server came back to us and asked if we would like to order dessert. We ordered a halo halo to go and a sago at gulaman. I didn't taste the halo halo because we gave it to my gfs grandma but the sago at gulaman was really good. Not too sweet but not too bland. I wished they put more ice though.  But overall the food is delicious. But just be prepared for the wait and the 'ok' service.",

Ordered a bunch to share:  Fried chicken-  that crispy skin though!  hook me up with the Jufran (banana ketchup) Pork Adobo- seasoned well and a crowd favorite  Lechon kawali- that fried pork belly so good!  Dip it with the vinegar Kare kare- oxtail stew with veggies ina savory peanut sauce pretty legit, not amazing, but good lumpia-  eggrolls-kind of bigger than i'm used to (no pun intended) but good appetizer Pancit- stir fried noodles, standard and good Flan-  sweet custard, deliciousness just like mom's  Got my filipino food fix here in Vegas.  My mom's pancit is still better than your mom's, but Max'z is a good place to introduce your non-filipino friends to some good filipino food.  Your filipino friends will still enjoy it here too.

All were fine and good but could have been better.  If you want a really good Halo Halo in Vegas, it is hard to beat Sasasweets Chillspot in the Container Park.   Will I go back to try new things, Yes. Just cause they make certain Filipino dishes ok doesn't mean they are all bad.  IMO - They have a great platform and would like to see them expand to try and make a healthier Filipino food because face it... A lot of our food isn't that healthy... I wish it was.  I think they would benefit from this, so we will see.",

    "text": "We sat down and ordered then I checked in and saw how bad the ratings were and started to get worried, but nothing bad happened on this trip. It's a new restaurant and seems to be experiencing the growing pains of learning their stuff while being crazy busy as times with all the buzz of a Max's here.  We got Max's chicken and it was fried the way it's supposed to be, moist with that signature light crisp skin. We got garlic rice to go with it and that was standard, but good and not overly oily. I was just in Philippines a few weeks ago and the chicken was cooked the same way as it was there.   Pancit palabok. This was decent enough. It was on the saucier side which I actually prefer as some places don't give enough sauce for me.  Our service was good. He was really friendly and kept on our drinks. The turnaround time on the food coming to the table wasn't long either.   No matter the Max's I go to, I never go during dinner peak times and definitely not on Sundays when Filipinos will flock after church in large groups and this will be a hot spot for Filipino birthday parties. The wait will probably piss you off and while the food is decent, it's not worth waiting a hour to get a seat so don't do that to yourself.    It's been open only 2-3 weeks so I hope they only get more consistent from here. I'm glad to have a sit down Filipino restaurant though since I rarely eat Filipino food. I hope my visits will be just as positive as this one.",

    "text": "I just moved to Las Vegas from San Diego and I was happy to find Max's Restaurant because it eases the homesickness a tad. The Max's in SD closed years ago so seeing it thriving here is definitely a treat.   Since I arrived here in December I have visited this place about 5 times already. I have dined in as well as phoned in pick up orders. Through my  experiences, I didn't realize that this restaurant was fairly new nor did I have any qualms about the service I received nor the quality of my food. In fact, during my last trip here, our server Lloyd was very amicable, polite, and sincere. I almost felt ashamed to hear an elder regard me with \"Po\" so obviously I tried to be an even more pleasant customer.  The nice thing is that a lot of the food here seems to be cook to order. For anyone who knows a little about cooking Filipino food, it doesn't take 5 minutes to tenderize your meat, deep fry your chicken, or soften your pancit. While I'm sure more kinks could be worked out in terms of speed, I'd much rather enjoy my food piping hot and fresh (with a 15-20 wait) than something that could easily be obtained from a \"turo-turo\" with a layer of soluble fat skimming the top.  Also, we brought some food to my family while they were visiting. Everyone knows that a homecooking 83 year old grandmother is the harshest critic of Filipino food. Needless to say, my nanay enjoyed her food very much and was surprised at the quality of the sisig and pancit. To each their own..   Anyhow, it might not quite be like home but for a family who is too lazy to cook, a transplant who wants a little taste of home, or a tourist/newcomer looking to try a different sort of Asian flare, I definitely recommend Max's.   Try their garlic fried rice, fried chicken, lechon sisig, and pancit miki if you want to be a little on the safe side. Also, their calamansi juice is very refreshing.   They've been around since 1945.. they must be doing something right!",

We came just as they opened for dinner (5pm as stated on the sign at the door).  However there were so many people seated and eating already when we got there..!  So much for a 5pm dinner time.  Anyways, on to the food. We ordered pansit bihon, lechon kawali, pork sisig, nilagang baka, and the famous whole chicken.  I was so unimpressed with everything we ordered..! I felt there was a definite lack of taste and flavor to all the dishes we ordered. As for their famous chicken.. mehhh.. I'll take jollibee fried chicken any day!  I was most disappointed with the nilagang baka.  We went to Max's restaurant in San Francisco a couple weeks back and it was one of the best nilagang baka I ever had, but sadly this location could not replicate that same great tasting soup :(  The prices to me seem a bit steep as well for food that's not all that great. The only positive thing I have to say about tonight's dining experience was the service.. Our server was friendly and attentive. The space of the restaurant is not half bad either.   Will I come back..? Maybe once the \"opening\" hoopla dies down, and they get the food right. But I don't forsee it happening in the near future.",

Even the waiter knows that the food is taking forever to arrive at the tables.   No compliments to the chef.  Y'all need to hire more staff, cooks, waiters, or whatever so that customers won't be waiting for so long for subpar food.

Came here with family which was a party of 11 so they had to split the tables but informed us ahead of time so that was nice. We were seated within maybe 10 mins of waiting so it wasn't that bad. The menu doesn't have very many options which isn't a bad thing but with that, I was expecting a little better quality in the food and was kin of disappointed. Anyways, the waiter took our orders and the food came out pretty fast.   First was this egg drop looking soup with bits of corn, carrots and ham(?) or spam? It was an alright soup. I wasn't impressed by it since it looked like something I could have whipped up easily and maybe even better. But it wasn't bad so I'd give it a 3/5.   Then the main food comes out which was an order of pancit, one whole chicken, kare-kare, and lechon kawali.  Pancit (2/5) - there was a very strong soy sauce flavor yet it wasn't salty. It was really weird but I really didn't like how I could taste this strong cheap soy sauce flavor. And it was also very wet. I'm not used to eating pancit like that and I just didn't think it was great.   Max's whole chicken (4/5) - nice crispy skin, but the chicken was more on the dry side. I wasn't crazy impressed but I did think it was delicious but for the price I think I like my auntys secret recipe chicken much better. It was good just not good enough for me to come back and want more.   Kare-kare (2/5) - meh. It was served in a medium bowl and looked like soup with veggies. There was barely any meat and tons of sauce, soup or whatever you wanna call it. Again, this dish didn't really \"wow\" me in any way. I just used that excess sauce to pour on top of my rice. The flavor just wasn't there for me.   Lechon kawali (3/5) - I understand that this is deep fried but I was really turned off by the amount of oil that was just sitting on the place. And I usually LOVE lechon kawali but man that was some serious grease fest on that plate that I didn't even wanna touch it. I had like two piece but it was just insanely oily. I wish they would have maybe patted it down or something before serving it on the plate.   The service was really great though. The waiters were fast and constantly checked up on our table. Super friendly. On the other hand, the food wasn't bad but wasn't the best either. I do admit that I enjoyed the chicken the most but I would only come back during family get togethers. I have Filipino pride but Filipino food is just too greasy for me sometimes! :/",

The employees were friendly, accommodating, and efficient no wonder the place was packed. They had great parking area so we had no problem parking our van. I just wished that the place was a bit bigger so we have more room to move around.  Overall, great experience, good food, & good value. If you're in Vegas try this humble Filipino restaurant.",

It was good, However I was surprised how maybe about 75% of the lechon kawali I ordered was fat. Too much fat and about 2 tablespoon of lechon sauce was served.   My sons ordered pancit palabok, and the fried chicken with french fries but no sauce at all...I was thinking should we just have gone to Jollibee instead?   This is a decent nice and welcoming place, service is good and waiters are kind but the lechon kawali was way too fatty, the fried chicken will be better with a sauce (and more lechon sauce too). Food could have been better cause it is a bit pricey.",

Not sure what type of chicken you are frying advertising a whole Chicken but it sure doesn't look like a whole chicken.  When I eat at a fancy Filipino Food joint I do tend to get very critical.  The original Sisig for me was too sticky, oily, and very watery. I wasn't  sure what I was eating.  Service - it felt our server was very Nervous in handling food and didn't really know how to place food in front of a toddler seating in a high chair. The sizzling Sisig and plates where placed right in front my son. Not to be critical but Refills in this town are consistent request.  It was a nice meal at the end and typical tend to visit Max when there is absolutely no option available due to the expensive cost of this place.",

Each location has a different atmosphere and a variety in the presentation and at times taste of dishes.   I decided to go to the Las Vegas location since it was just less than 5 minutes from the strop.   It is located in a strip mall adjacent to Seafood City.  This was definitely one of the more larger Max's locations.   **PROs: -quick service -spacious restaurant -halo halo! -weekly specials! They have a senior day & 50% off crispy pata day!  -very close to the strip  -Fiesta plate! Mixture of the famous crispy Max's chicken and pancit. Comes with a crispy lumpia of your choice and a small caramel bar. -Max's is well knows for its crispy chicken, dip it in its 3 sauces which is a mixture of banana ketchup, hot sauce/tobasco, & worchestire sauce.  **CONs: -didn't find any cons, just that we couldn't avail of their 50% off crispy pata lol!  Dishes to try: -Max's Chicken -Kare Kare -Crispy Pata -Pancit Palabok -Halo Halo  A must try if you are tired of the Vegas buffets and are craving some good 'ok Filipino food.",

Look, Max's used to reign supreme in taste and quality, but since they immigrated to the States, they've become an entitled, 'we're in America now, bitches' type of relative.  Fu*k yo couch.  The chicken was half decent if you only rate the crispyness of the skin.  The Kare Kare, previously heretofore my all-time favorite, was like running a locomotive against the Hoover Dam.  Not good at all. Mostly gravy with a few vegetables thrown in as if an afterthought.  Who does the ordering here?  Scrooge?  The ox tail was barely there.  Just like the monokini sported by Borat on a French Beach.  I know ox tails are expensive, but you used the cows from Peter Dinklage's back yard.  They were like M&Ms in a huge box of Cracker Jacks.  Absolutely shite, Gordon.  Between the multiple closures for health violations - yeah this place is the reigning king of Dirty Dining segment here in Vegas, this is a place to avoid.

After you feast on that you must go for the halo halo dessert which I highly recommend. Customer service is up to par, they'll speak to you nicely and refill your drinks without asking. Parking is open right outside. This franchise is so popular that I have ate at their different locations such as Hawaii and New York.",

    "text": "After a play at UNLV, I drove the short distance here for dinner.  The company had donated coupons to Vitalant Blood Center to a free entree to donors and I wanted to use the coupon.  I had never heard of Max's before.  Years ago, this building was some Texas steakhouse or something like that.  I was seated in a short time.  They were quite busy and there were several large family groups with at least four birthdays. After looking at the menu for a while, I asked about getting a smaller portion of lumpia than the large portions shown in the Yelp photos but he said they only come in 18 mini lumpia.  He had a suggestion that I could take the uneaten home and reheat when I wanted.  I did not agree with that idea.  I opted for the soup of the day which was chicken ginger (small portion) and I ordered the lechon kawali sisig for my main course.  I also ordered a side of rice which does not come with the meal.  They only had raspberry sweetened iced tea so I got a diet not Coke.  The server brought my bowl of soup.  He left before I could snag some silverware or napkins.  The soup was served with a teaspoon on the side.  I am not fond of eating soup with a teaspoon but that's what I had to do.  When he brought my main course, I was able to get him to bring some silverware and napkins.  The sisig was sizzling nicely when it arrived and the pork belly was very good.  Taking some rice and then putting the pork over it made for a good mixture.  I did try some of the banana sauce which a friend told me was Filipino ketchup.  I generally don't use ketchup and I wouldn't use this either unless I really needed to add some moisture to some dry food.  It had some flavor of banana but I found it to be too sweet--like ketchup--to use on good food.  For dessert, I ordered some halo halo.  It came in a plastic cup which made it difficult to enjoy the many flavors that you get with halo halo.  At first, all I got was a lot of shaved ice which overpowered the ube ice cream.  When I was able to get deeper into the cup, I was finally able to get some red beans and gelatins that make halo halo so good.  Filipino restaurants are places where you need to go with a group of people so you can get several things and share.  That being said, I may be back to Max's to try the kare kare.  I'll take someone with me so we can get lumpia, too.  Thanks to Max's for supporting Vitalant and its donors.  It is appreciated!",

The chicken is great (always) but their lumpia was obviously just previously frozen, the same type yoh could buy from any Filipino market, the Pancit was greasy and although they serve fries (which were undercooked not crispy), they do not have traditional ketchup, just Filipino style banana ketchup.  The bathrooms though... My goodness. So bad. Dirty, paper on the floor for the entire time we were there, and the one urinal in the men's room is out of order so that means much dirtier toilets due to us men having um... \"Bad aim\" is the heat way to say it.  It wasn't a great experience. The food was just acceptable and if if weren't for their signature chicken still being great, I'd have to one star them.",

I tried to call to make a reservation but they told me they didn't accept reservations on weekends. (TIP)  After we sat, we were greeted right away by a busser who took our drink our and served it quickly.  I got the mango juice which was pretty good. And my boyfriend and my dad got the red horse, taking it back to the Philippines for real. Lol  It was pretty busy that night.  So our server apologized when he came to us to take our order. He was very polite and made sure everything was good throughout the night.  We ordered Kare kare, side of garlic rice, bangus, pork sushi and the lumpia ubod.  Everything was really good!!

    "text": "Came here for a little reunion with my Ninong (Godfather) and I tried to keep an open mind coming into this place (trying not to compare to Philippines) but I was disappointed. I love that the decoration was on point plus the menu seemed to have the usual choices. We ordered bulalo, pancit, whole chicken (2, of course) and bangus. I love soup and I'm a huge fan of bulalo (my moms, of course) and the second I tasted it I wanted to spit it out. IT WAS SO SALTY!!!! I had to call the waitress back and I told her to please add more hot water or something because it's not edible. She was nice enough to take it back and they added more soup. The fried chicken tasted like Philippines Max restaurant. The fries were cold ::sad face:: my kids didn't enjoy the cold fries. The pancit was decent and the Bangus was ok. Overall, the food was nothing special... I could buy a whole chicken for less than $15 somewhere else. The Bulalo was $19 and it was awful. The one thing I couldn't stand was that I had to keep waiting for the water jar to be filled up for me to have water. No one came to bring water to us until we had none left. No one checked up on us to see if we needed anything else. They had a bunch of empty tables! They weren't busy! Customer service really makes up for bad food sometimes or decent food. In this case, the food was ok and customer service was not good so 2.5 stars for me. I",

My boyfriend and I were staying at Tuscany Suites so this was conveniently located nearby and across the street from the 99 cents store. If you've never been to Max's before, then it is a Filipino restaurant that has a wide spread of food to choose from, from individual portions to shareable entrees. You can even cater if you like. There is also a room that is designated for private events as my mom and her kulasa typically use that space when their friends come to visit from Manila.   I was seriously craving some kare kare and my boyfriend is a die hard pork bbq fan so that was our order for lunch. In truth, the kare kare was absolutely delicious but I wish that I had a larger portion. There was definitely more rice in there than there was of the actual meal... and of course since it's oxtail it looks like more meat than it actually is.   The pork bbq on the other hand, however, was absolutely bursting with meat so I was very fortunate to have ordered that.   Overall, I loved my experience here and would definitely return for another visit!  (56/100-2018)",

We specifically came here for their Max chicken since my parents kept saying how delicious it is. Since we were in town, why not show my husband some Filipino dishes.   We ordered the Max chicken, garlic fried rice, and beef sinigang. Maybe because there was an event going on and the influx of people within minutes of each other caused the service to be slow. Our server was nice though.  The chicken was really good. The skin was crispy and had that salt-vinegar deliciousness. The meat was tender; it kept falling off the bone!  The beef sinigang was good too. The broth was more orange, which means they put a lot of tomatoes in the broth. The tomatoes definitely gave it a more acidic profile. I love this sinigang style of cooking. The order was good for two people.   The garlic fried rice was okay, it was not as garlicky as I would prefer it. But it was good enough.   I definitely would come back if I were in town again. But then again, why not expand to the Midwest? We already have Seafood city and 2 Jollibee. We need Max and Chowking!",

The Bangus as a bit overly cooked but still a treat.  Plenty of parking.  A bit expensive but worth the hassle of not cooking.  Save room for Halo Halo.  That's hard when there are so many choices.  You can never just choose one thing.  I do wish they had a meal where a small bowl of soup, side and bangus was available instead of ordering all this food family style.    It's a drive from the strip but worth it.  Might as well get groceries for the hotel room since it's in the same complex",

I got all excited because I have not gone to a non fast food Filipino resturant in a while. Well. I just left.  First, the hostess was rude.  There was a party of three behind us & she was about to seat them ignoring that we were in front waiting for a table. The hostess asked us very curtly if we were first & we said yes & she made some disparaging grunts. That got the party behind us huffy & asked when they were going to get sat down.   They sat us down & then ignored us for about 20-30 min. Gave us menus & then walked away.   Meanwhile, the party behind us got sat adjacent to us, their waiter promptly showed up, took their drink orders, & proceded to bring their appitizers. We just sat there waiting, 10 min later still no waiter.   Thanks Max's! The only thing I can think of is that my husband is Caucasian & I am Filipino - we pretty much were the only interracial couple there & pretty much got treated like crap. The family behind us was entirely Filipino.   You really should not judge a book by its cover. I'll be sure to let everyone know at the convention to steer clear from your establishment, as I've never been treated like this.",

    "text": "Well I now know where to go if I want some really amazing filipino food (yes don't let the profile picture fool you) when I am in Las Vegas!   My wife was actually laughing at how excited I was to eat here and even after the meal she walked away impressed (and she is more white then I am at times). Ha-ha! Ok now, focusing.....  For starters we began with fresh lumpia (lumpiang ubod) as an appetizer and that blew me away. The ingredients tasted so fresh and the sauce (peanut butter) was just to die for! OMG, you must must try the fried chicken. They are known for it for a reason as that sucker was just melt in your mouth scrumptious! The chicken was just moist to the nine and the skin was so light and far from greasy at all, so well done! My main attraction was the spaghetti which hence the 4 to be honest. I mean don't get me wrong it was great, but I think I prefer Jollibee's a tad more. I just felt the sauce didn't have the same sweetness I am used to and prefer. Also I'd have liked to see just a little more hot dog in there than what I had consumed. Finally for dessert which I \"didn't have room for\" was the halo halo. This by far was the best I've ever had. They make it from scratch so definitely felt the love. The bean is not as pasty as I usually taste which was a relief. The ube ice cream is just out of this world (perfect blend of sweet, similar to how I prefer my ube slush with boba). Another definite must try to end the meal  All in all the staff is very inviting and prime examples of what the culture truly is all about. I felt like family here and will certainly back for round #2 somewhere in the near future!",

We were not sure what to order but the hostess gave her suggestions and she was right!  She suggested the pork belly & shrimp sinagang (spelling??) which has a sour tomato base broth, which was very tasty, especially when I do not prefer sour foods.  We also had bihon pancit with vegetables, chicken, pork and shrimp, as well as garlic rice.  There was garlic in every bite and it was heaven!  I definitely enjoyed my first time here, from the gracious hostess, to the attentive server, but most of all the very tasty good!  Definitely will come back whenever we visit Las Vegas in the future.",

    "text": "Before a roadtrip back to LA, my friends family and I (they're Filipino) stopped here for brunch. They knew what was good so I just let them order.   They got the fried chicken, egg noodle pancit, fresh spring rolls, egg rolls,garlic rice,  and milk fish. (Sorry I can't remember the names of the dishes)   All of them tasted good! The sauce for the spring roll could be better in my opinion but for the amount of food we got (which was a lot), it was a great meal.   We also got halo halo and the coconut jelly dessert at the end which were both delicious! The staff were very attentive and nice. Got really busy fast.   CHICKEN - tender, crispy, and seasoned right. Came with fries. Fries were okay. Soggy.   PANCIT - couldn't tell it was different from a regular noodle stir fry. I've had rice noodle pancit before, so maybe that is why.   EGG ROLLS - very crispy. Good portions. It seemed like it was the frozen kind and not made there looking at the filling (sausage-y?) but idk if it's suppose to be like that.   SPRING ROLLS - Filled with bamboo shoots. MUST eat with the peanut sauce or its kind of plain.   GARLIC RICE - Smelled so good when it came. Every bite you can taste the fragrance of delicious garlic.   MILK FISH - ask for extra lemons. Great with it. Kind of oily, but sill very good. Lots of onions.   I would come here again if I get the chance :)",

We were thinking that the plates would be small for some reason, so we ordered several plates. We were WRONG. It's a Filipino restaurant, they want you to EAT.  We ordered the fried half-chicken (OMG DELICIOUS), Kare-Kare, Chicken Adobo, Beef Sisig, Pancit Bihon, Lechon, and sinigang. Everything was just like the family cooked it. The FRIED CHICKEN, though: it was perfectly crisp, not battered, and perfectly tender. While they wouldn't tell us the secret, they did tell us it was a spring chicken.  Of course you can't leave without halo-halo. And it was on POINT.  Must try, but it is somewhat family style, so don't order everything, even though it is an option!",

Now I know why(shocking).They were in dirty dinning for rodents and dirty equipment(nasty). Although the food was fairly \"good\", the service though on the other hand sucks really bad.  It feels like they don't really care about you and It wasn't even busy that night. It took them like 30 mins just for us to get our refills. I'll never ever go to this place again.",

Very good and the sauce was just right as well. We tried two noodle dishes, one was the rice noodles and the other was like lo mien. They both were fabulous along with the speciality which is the chicken. It was some of the best chicken I had ever tasted, very juicy and flavorful. We shared it all and that is what I would recommend. If we are ever near these parts of Vegas we will go again! ENJOY!!!",

I like the design of their bar which I think is quite different compared to other filipino restaurants in Vegas. The servers were cool and I admired their patience because if you've noticed some pinoys are maarte. Anyway, the Max's platter has everything you need to try if it is your first time. I suggest you come really early or reserve because when we went there it was packed and super slow (waited 53mins for food). Good thing my friend were able to bribed the host $5 to get us seated immediately and reduced our waiting time. Overall my experience was OK. I don't feel excited to come back. Hopefully their service will get better because I love filipinoy food maan! :)",

    "text": "Late post - this happened earlier last month.  The long awaited opening of Max's is finally here.  Here are my thoughts about this place:  1) WAIT = The long wait was expected because of all the hype. No problem there...the only issue I had was when the host tried to give my spot in line to somebody that he knows.  When I approached him about it, he told me that he doesn't have a table for 4 yet he offered a table for 4 to his friends that just got there. 2) AMBIANCE = the ambiance was good. Definitely a good family place to dine in.  They also have a bar inside which is a plus considering their location. It also set up nicely for private events as there are sliding doors that could separate sections of the restaurant. 3)  SERVICE = The service wasn't as good as expected but given the fact that they just opened 8 nights ago (dinner only), I have to say that they have to do a lot of training specially their bussers. It took 15 mins before we got our drinks while there are at least 3 bussers walking around for plates to be put away instead of making sure that all the customers waiting gets their drinks first.  I finally called one of the staff which seems to be a manager or a supervisor as he wasn't wearing the waiter uniform instead he was wearing a blue shirt with a tie. I had to ask for our water and informed him that we are ready to order. After placing our order, it took another 10 mins and my husband has to asked another server for our drinks. Our waiter Lloyd apologize multiple times about the delay which is nice. He made the rest of our dining experience tolerable. 4) FOOD = We ordered 1 full chicken, regular crispy pata, regular kare kare and bicol express and buko pandan for dessert.  The chicken was ok, I think the one in Glendale was better. The Crispy Pata was amazingly good. It was fried perfectly on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. The Kare-Kare was also good. The Bicol Express is perfectly seasoned and spiciness hit the spot. The buko pandan was delicious but the winner for tonight's dinner was definitely the Crispy Pata.  Overall, the management should consider training their staff more on quality customer service so they don't end up a failure like Goldilocks. We, Las Vegans are quite particular with the quality of service and food since we are blessed with many upscale restaurants. I would definitely give them another chance and comeback.",

Order over the phone and do carry out. I'll never ever ever come back to this restaurant even if you were to pay me to go. I don't understand why there's like 10 guys on the floor and our server only had 2 tables (that's including us)  and he told us twice he'll be back to take our order. Yeah right!  I think I have a better chance winning the lotto than to ever get my order taken.  I'm so upset this happened especially how slow it was at 3pm on a Friday. My family and I got up and left!

    "text": "Ate here for my nephews' b-days. My review is based on eating here just once with a party size of 11. The only other table service filipino restaurant I've eaten was Salo-Salo and in my opinion that one went downhill through the years. This one definitely has a better atmosphere and the service was good.  The food we ordered was serve family style. We ordered lumpia, kare kare, friend chicken, adobo, and palabok. We also finished the meal with Ube Ice cream. The food was good though my family (they were born and raised in the Phillipines) commented that the fried chicken was ok yet lacked the taste they were use to back home. I enjoyed the palabok. I'm happy they used the thicker noodles (other filipino restaurants use the thin ones). The ice cream was nice. I'm glad it didn't have ice crystals in it.   The service was good with all the waiters filling our waters/drinks frequently. This place definitely is cleaner than Salo- Salo (no roaches roaming).   Price-wise this place is a little expensive.",

    "text": "We were in search for good Filipino cuisine. Based upon the good review from the SEVEN Magazine, we decided to give them a try.  It was a little mystery to find out where exactly the door was. However, with a little help from someone directing us to the door we finally made it in.   Although I am an avid tea drinker, I was left a tea bag with my daughter to show us the type of iced tea they have. By the way when does ice tea get served in a bag. definitely a miscommunication, an odd presentation indeed.  Based upon the menu being Filipino, when trying to order shanghai lumpia I was told they didn't have any. I attempted to clarify further with the server to find out if they are not served or ran out. The server responded, \" It's eighty-six.\"  Cutting straight to the food, egg pansit, beef stew and asparagus eggplant tofu were all grossly salty. I thought for sure my blood pressure rose 100 percent. All entries overall lacked flavor and had a very unhealthy overtone.   I would not recommend this place anyone! We  left to Firefly and finished up an fabulous dinner there!",

I've been to other Max's locations and this one in Vegas is the best by far. The service was on point. Our waiter was nice and polite. Also, the restaurant was clean! Finally, I thought the food was delish! My husband's sinigang tasted like it was made from scratch and not from the mix. I got the chicken and pancit bihon and enjoyed every bite. To top it off, we shared a yummy halo-halo. The reason why I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars is because the menu is more pricey compared to other Filipino restaurants. I guess you're paying a premium for its class! ;)",

I arrived to pick it up 25 min later and they had lost my order of chicken adobo. They rushed a replacement order thru (cab was still ticking) and didn't mention it did not come with rice. When I got back to my hotel, I was disappointed to see it was gonna be just chicken adobo and nothing to soak up all that awesome adobo sauce.  The chicken adobo was nice- but nothing amazing. I would maybe come back again to try something else, but maybe not as takeout.",

We arrived about 5:30 and was told the wait was 40 minutes and to give them our number so they could text us when a table was open. 47 Minutes later we got a text and were seated promptly. About 6 Minutes later a guy appearing to be the manager was taking our order.. We ordered the appetizer of calamari but it was sold out, Understandable, as max's calamari is known to be very good. So we just went ahead and ordered 1 Mickey Bihon,1 Whole Chicken 1 Regular Crispy Pata and a large garlic rice. All the food was very delicious and served very hot. Our drinks were refilled promptly as well, Overall pretty good for not even being fully open..   Give them a break guys... Im sure things will get better after the staff has a chance to get used to everything and the hype dies down. All of the max's i have been to in the Philippines have really good food and very bad service LOL,.. So Calm down you 1 star people.. Go make a review of McDonalds..",

    "text": "3.5 stars, but I'll round it up to 4 because they don't deserve an average of 2 and a half stars. I came with 2 others making us a party of 3 on a Friday night. Like everyone said in their reviews the wait is about 45 minutes, which is True. Although the other patrons start complaining about other parties getting called before them and the hosts nicely explain it's based on availability of tables and not the order you come in. C'on people give them a break they just opened, do you expect them to have everything perfect within the first few weeks?! The management team running this place probably have more restaurant experience than you anyway. Jackie was our server and she was pretty good for the most part. We didn't wait too long for our food because I think she had rushed the kitchen since we had asked how much longer it would be before our food was served. We order the chicken sisig, pancit canton and a whole chicken. Shoulda just ordered the chicken like everyone said. Although I did enjoy the pancit canton because they used a different type of noodle. On the other hand, the sisig was just a mess, what's up with the mayo?! It didn't have the vinegar in it like the traditional way. I read in another review it is like flop of mayo called sisig, which is True so I don't recommend ordering this. We had to wait a good 20 minutes to pay because supposedly the credit card machine was acting up, but Jackie was very apologetic about this. I must say her service did make our experience overall better. Lastly, the interior is pretty nice, beautiful for Filipino standards. Next time I need my chicken fix, I'll just order it for take out.",

I always like the sizzling pork sisig but I was not very pleased with the first order. One of the crew, approached me, sadly I forgot her name, Marion or something, she started asking and offered to do something about it and reall, really.... exerted effort for me to have a satisfying lunch with my family. She made sure that the actual Chef in the kitchen will fix my food and do it better. Even the main Chef, came up to our table and made a little conversation which surprisingly doesnt happen anywhere except when requested. He is a Filipino man dressed up in a white chef uniform with his hat. Very professional and presentable. I always go to the one in Glendale and its a turn off to see the cooks talking so.... loud while you are eating and you can practically recognize how they cook your food by the loudness of their voices. Big no no!!!   At any rate, I give 5 star to this establishment as they deserve it!!! Will definitely come back!",

We ordered, food came in a pretty good time, but the server brought it one by one, and when he served the sinigang he was holding the bowl on the top side, which wasn't supposed to be because his finger was close to the food. It was a good experience. Good food, but I didn't see any chicken on the menu, maybe i just flipped the pages too fast.",

We started off with Max's Teasers - lumpiang shanghai, sweet potato fries & calamares. For our entrees, we shared family style and had beef kaldereta, lechon kawali and garlic rice, and our daughter had the calamansi juice.  All dishes were served in large portions especially the garlic rice.  The beef and lechon were just the right flavor & seasoning, juicy and tender.  The calamansi juice was a tad too sweet.  For dessert, we had their yummy halo-halo. Overall Max's Filipino food was delicious and the service was great.  We'll be back to try their famous fried chicken and their other traditional Filipino dishes.",

My visit wasn't at all bad- I read all the reviews prior to going, so I was very prepared for the non attentive service by our waitress. Took forever to order, food took a bit to arrive, didn't check on us once, and had to ask for refills as well as our check. Good thing I was with family, we were able to visit.  Now as for the food, I ordered the basics, (5 of us) pancit canton, pork adobo, bistek, lechon, 1/2 fried chicken, and of course the large bowl of rice! Everything was delicious. I ate so much that I still can't breathe. As long as you don't expect great service, the food won't be disappointing, taste just like home. Enjoy!",

I was disappointed from the start. Starting off with the service, we were a party of 6 and usually, it's understandable that we would have to wait since there was a lot of people. We were told to wait for \"less than 20 minutes\"  20 minuets went by and yet we weren't seated yet. More people started to come in and they came in groups of 10, but yet they were seated instantly because they were a bigger group! Within 5 minuets we were promised a table when a big group was about to leave, but less then 10 minuets later another group of 10 came and just took our table!   We were then seated after a whole hour...  Now with the food. It was dry and tasteless.   Growing up in the Philippines especially when it comes to traditional food everything needed to be spiced up and juicy. Max did NOT do that with their food.   I felt so robbed when I had to pay $104.87 just for a bunch of food that taste like a cardboard.",

It took 30 mins or even longer for our food to be served and its not even peak hours (3 pm).   2) Flat soda: Husband ordered diet Pepsi and it was so flat we had to ask for new one. The new one has some carbonation but because food took so long to come, it was already flat way before actually eating.  3) Waiting area cleanliness. The waiting area had straw papers strewn about.  4) They ran out of eggplant salad. They gave complimentary chicken but my heart was set of some ensalada.    5) So-so food. The lechon was a little burnt. The beef sisig was weird lol. The chicken  & the buko pandan was their saving grace.  6) Slow service. There's a lot of wondering when we're gonna be served.   !The waiter himself is nice but the restaurant was not busy at all so I expected faster service. There's a bunch of waitresses just sitting by the corner so I really don't get it.",

    "text": "Went here on 7/3/14 with Brian P. for a quick dinner after driving past this place about a billion times. I actually really like Filipino food and the fact that this wasn't a walk up counter where I order two items with a side of rice appealed to me.   The place looks very nice inside, as do the staff. We were seated at a table next to some older people who were complaining amongst themselves about how the food was cold and not that good. Ugh. Not a good sign.  Looking over the menu, I was a bit surprised at the prices. When I can buy a roasted whole chicken at Smith's for $4.99 right now, can somebody please tell me what is with restuarants trying to sell me a whole fried chicken for $14.95? Value is just as important as quality to me. This food was not a good deal.  Because Brian hates seafood and cilantro and... hmmm, lots of stuff, it was difficult trying to find stuff I thought he'd eat. We settled on sharing the half chicken dinner ($11.95) and I chose the soup of the day which was corn crab (none for Brian) and  the tapsilog $7.95.  My meal was majorly disappointing when it came out. It just looked blah. Small, neutral colored portions on a large plate for $12 just looked chintzy. The corn crab soup had good flavor and that was the only thing that I found delicious.   I liked the tapsilog but it's basically just steak and eggs with a side of pickled vegetable strips, which were good. It was not a stand out dish by any means.  Service was eh, and kitchen staff could be seen jumping around while wielding a fly swatter in the kitchen. It is what it is.  I've had good Filipino food, and I've had mediocre Filipino food, and Max's definitely falls into the latter catagory.",

Probably because we all had our menus shut due to the fact that we had a lot of time to look at it while waiting for a table (1hr and 44 min). This wait made no sense at all. There were hardly any people seated and I would said 90 % of the tables were empty but had not been cleaned from other people who already finished eating and left.   It started off as fast service when once we were seated.  Then it went down hill from there.   30 min until  our drinks came out.  Literally took 1 hour and 20 min to get our food  for 2 people only? What about the other two in our party?! 30 minutes later the other 2 entrees were served.  Not only that it took over an hour for food but the food didn't come out at one time. This was bad.  I finished my coconut water 30 minutes before the food came out and asked if their were refills. I was told no. Fine I'll take that but I was hoping I would be able to enjoy my drink with my food.   Half of us were done eating before the other half got their food. I would have rather them just keep the two entrees that were done and serve all 4 of us at the same time. This made no sense.   Next time I'll just order for pick up. If I do go back.",

Lol  \\_()_/    I've had Max's Chicken in California but today was the first time I had it in Vegas. This place is pretty spiffy! The inside is really nice. Big broad windows, individual rooms for large parties, very spacious! I'm very impressed with the layout especially in that part of town.   For food-- we had ordered: fried chicken (duh), Kare Kare, Sisig, Sizzling Tofu, caldereta, and Sinigang. All were pretty good. They are known for the chicken so I had no complaints about it especially if you dip it in banana ketchup! Yum! Other foods, I've honestly had better. The sizzling tofu was probably the only thing I would come back & order again. It had a good kick to it & the sauce they served it with was awesome. The Sisig didn't taste like any kind I have ever had. Kare Kare was alright, had better.   Also, the soda they served us was flat. Even told them it was, they brought another round of soda.. Which was also flat. Took forever to get a round of water for everyone. My glass of water was empty for a while before someone noticed and filled it.   They don't include gratuity on the bill even with large parties which I thought was different but they do show what you SHOULD tip at the bottom of the receipt.",

Im not sure if they are short on servers, but we only saw our waitress 2 times, first when she got our order and next is when she brought our food. We have to chase somebody around for a refill of drinks and to place additional order. There is definitely a room for improvement in that area.  I will give this place another try and hope service gets better.",

    "text": "I decided to come back for lunch again from two weeks ago, when I tried the chicken and pancit lunch combo which was just so so.  Today, I went for the Kare-kare ala carte (about $14) with a side of steamed rice.  In brief, I was again disappointed for these reasons:  1) For the price, I felt the serving was rather small by comparison to other sit-down Flip restaurants; 2) While the gravy tasted fine, it was a bit starchy and not as creamy as I'd expect;  3) Veggies consisted only of bok choy and chinese long beans.  For this price point, I'd expect eggplants, and other traditional accompaniments; 4) While the beef pieces were tender enough, there were basically about 4 pieces sufficiently enough for one person.  For the price and being that this is an ala carte dish, I would expect this to be enough to share with at least 2 or 3 people with other dishes.  Altogether with tip (service was fine), my lunch was around $20 which was expected.  However, for just over half this price, I can find other turn-turo style restaurants with a better quality dish.  This is a shame because I truly want to see more sit-down filipino restaurants that can do well and compete with many more popular asian cuisine.  I hope this review will help encourage Max to get back to what gave you the great reputation you once had.",

We were sat immediately, and our orders were taken promptly. The restaurant was very clean and the ambiance, being seated by the fireplace, was perfect.   There were 3 of us, and since we came for the famous fried chicken, we ordered a whole chicken and garlic fried rice. The whole meal was less than $25, and we had left overs.  Fried chicken: absolutely one of the most delicious Fried chicken out there! Their fried chicken is on breaded, but it is packed with flavor.   Garlic fried rice is life!!! If you like garlic, then this is your alley, boo. Try it and sing your hallelujahs!   Fried chicken came with fries ... the fries, we aren't too excited about. But hey, it's all good.  All in all, I highly recommend.   Great food with an even greater customer service.",

    "text": "***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 86/100***  Like I always say, Filipino food is always best when home cooked. There are times though when it's not about the food, but the company and family gatherings that brings you to places like Max's. We were celebrating my mom's birthday and this was the place she chose. We have been to their locations in California multiple times and I must say I favor this location more as it is bigger and decorated better than their counterparts. The several times we've been here, we've never had to wait so that's a big plus!  Items ordered: Lumpia (pork and shrimp egg rolls) $7.95 - it's your typical tasting egg roll, fried to a perfect crisp. Always a hit with the kids.  Calamari $7.95 - Lightly battered squid, chewy and tasteless. Skip this.  Max Fried chicken $14.95 - This is their specialty. Tender and moist, the crispy skin is the best part and better when dipped in banana ketchup (you have to be Filipino to truly relate to this lol)  Pancit canton (egg noodles sauteed with vegetables, pork, chicken and shrimp) $8.95 - I have had many pancit in my life, this was actually pretty tasty. It's also one of their popular dishes.  Sinigang na baboy (sour Pork soup with vegetables) $17.95 - I have a bias opinion on this one as my mother makes the best soup I've had. Theirs was okay, it could use a little more punch. The eggplant they used was terrible though. I've read one other review that mentioned that as well.  Lechon Kawali sisig (sizzling diced pork belly with diced onions and jalapeno) $11.95 Kapistahan in LA makes the best lechon kawali sisig EVER! I have yet to find a place here in Vegas that comes close to it. Max's version has some redeeming points taste wise but some parts the texture was off. We've ordered this about 4 different times and texture always seemed off.  They have a variety of drinks popular to Filipinos like Calamansi (Philippine lime) and Sago't Gulaman (tapioca & gelatin) for $3.50 each. For dessert I had Buko Pandan $4.95, that was only okay in my book. It seems like the one is California tastes so much better.   My mom's friend brought a cake from Red Ribbon and they said we could eat it without corkage fee which was nice because some places will charge you for bringing your own cake. Downside was they never brought any plates for it hahaha, we didn't bother as we had some extra ones we didn't use. Service was just okay, our waiter was timid but cordial, we had to flag him down several times for drink refills. I'm not totally opposed to coming back here at anytime as their food is decent. But the quest continues...",

We ordered pancit canton, BBQ pork skewers, and sinigang. The food came out rather quickly and we devoured it before I could take decent pictures. Sorry  The pancit was a little too salty for my palate. The sinigang was perfect. The pork skewers had a little too much fat on it but still tastes great!   The place was clean and organized. The restroom was clean and freshly scented.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and would come back again to try other dishes.   Foodies, a must try if you're craving Filipino food in Las Vegas, NV.",

Parties of two, three and four arrived after us and got seated before we did.  Kirt V. came by to chat and was inconsiderate, to put it extremely lightly.  We heard excuses and how there was nothing he could do to remedy our situation.     This 'manager\" Kirt, not only did not attempt  to apologize  for the wait but had the nerve to answer us back. This man surely needs to be re-trained as a manager or better yet demoted. What if we were a mystery shopper? Epic fail..  Kirt unfortunately sure gave Max's a very bad image.  Arrogance and hostility may be Kirt...but certainly not Max's!  The only saving grace for Max's was our hostess who did apologize profusely.but by then it was too late and we were off to find food for our kiddos!",

From the fireplace to the bar with flatscreen TVs to the updated decor I give them props. The food and service equally matched the look of the restaurant. Chicken was crispy and moist, the garlic rice was like no other. Definitely my go to place when I'm craving Filipino food in the city of sin.",

Just so you know, Max's is some kind of a \"fine dining\" restaurant, so expect to wait for a while or a couple of minutes for your order. Me and my husband ordered their famous:   *Whole chicken (w/ coleslaw and fries) Surprisingly good and taste like Max's in the Philippines. Love the fries, didn't even try to taste the coleslaw Not a single bite of it, coz it looks so dry.   *Kare-Kare, taste like kare-kare but it lacks of vegetables. But the most disappointing part was, it has lumps! We asked the manager/supervisor how did they cook their kare-kare he said it's pre made then, they froze it then, heat it whenever there's an order. That explains the Lumps! Lol  *Lumpiang ubod, is nothing without the peanut sauce! It is so plain! Lack of ingredients and doesn't contain the real taste of lumpiang ubod.    We just got disappointed with the food and the price. I don't know if we're still coming back.",

Sweet and accommodating; she made me feel really comfortable when the other items on the \"Max's Platter\" did not.   So according to the previous sentence, I ordered the the Max's Platter.   1.  Chicken:  actually more like a  2. Rice: actually very surprisingly good amount. Some restaurants skimp out on the rice knowing that their Asian audience will order more. But Max's takes care of you with that.  3. Pancit: salty and mine came out cold. Like that's just gross.  4. Random orange 5. Random packaged caramel bar. No thanks, I don't want to eat something wrapped in plastic on my plate.   Okay, so, Colette.  I told her that my pancit was cold. And she replaced it without hesitation. I guess everyone else is on the sucky side here, and I lucked out! She checked on my food after it was replaced and told me to let her know if it wasn't to my satisfaction. Which it kind of wasn't because it was salty but that's okay I was full anyway.   So two things. Chicken (with the Jufran) & Colette.   Have a nice Thursday, reader.",

GET A GRIP PEOPLE...THIS RESTAURANT IS NEW IN LAS VEGAS...  SO ANYWAY ONTO MY GREAT COMMENT ABOUT MAX'S AND THE AWESOME SERVICE THAT I HAD.  =D  I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!!!  I've NEVER had Filipino food before.  Now, I'm hooked and in love!  I have no complaints at all.  The service was FAST, food was great.  I will visit this restaurant again and again.  WHAT I ORDERED:  Ok, so they had a \"teaser opening\"  that I was invited to.  (YAY!)  I had Max's famous chicken, fries, and coleslaw.  OMGGG.  It was juicy, and very tasty.  The fries were nice and hot!! =D and the coleslaw was good.  The server, Noel, had me try the banana ketchup with hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce which (let me tell you) was GOOOOODDDD as a dipping sauce OR just with the chicken's natural flavors.  I can't think of the name of the dessert I tried!!!! AGHHHHH forgive me guys.  I can just describe it...it was in a glass, it had purple ice cream (which was coconut) crushed ice and small candy pieces!?  Next time I visit, I will have my phone charged, and take pictures of the menu.  --Maddi",

Last night, we ordered the chicken, bulalo, garlic fried rice, and lechon kawali.  ALL of them were not up to par.  What a waste of my $$.  Max Las Vegas is very much aware of people's complaints of their flavourless chcken and, yet, they have not improved.  The bulalo was mostly broth.  We had two pieces of fat, a bit of meat, about 3 strips of cabbage and 2 corn on the cob.  I was expecting much more for $17.95.  The lechon kawali was not fresh at all.  The meat was dark and tough.  The garlic fried rice was just okay.  There was absolutely nothing special about it.    I have to say that our waiter, Gilbert, was AWESOME.  He was most attentive and very knowledgeable of their food items.  Kudos to him - just not the food.  I don't think I will be going back to Max'.",

Pros (very few)  -Courteous staff, very apologetic for their inadequate supply of favorite menu items. i.e. Lechon Kawali, Pork Sisig & Calamansi.  -Clean dining and bar area. Most likely cause they just opened. (We'll see how long that'll last)  Cons  -Servers are not competent of their job description and are forgetful of serving basics. i.e. Always get the drink orders first before taking food orders or any food has come out, not informing patrons of items that are currently unavailable, forgetting to bring the dessert portion of the meal (which is included when ordering one of the combo meals)  -Restaurant was only half full, yet the waiting area in the front was nearly packed and the wait was 10 mins on what appears to be a slow night.   With that said, this may be a new restaurant in the area, but this is a popular and successful chain in the Philippines and California.  So they have no excuse for any short comings or inexperience with opening up this new location. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING!!! Beware!",

    "text": "The interior is nice and clean. Service is great!!! My boyfriend and I don't know why it only has 3 stars. Eating here brought back memories of my dining experience in Max's in the Philippines. It's my dad's favorite restaurant, and now it's mine.   With our 3 visits so far, we've had: 1.) MAX'S CHICKEN - Got the half chicken since we wanted variety. It's crispy. My boyfriend wants a bit more seasoning, but I think it's perfect; it's just how I remembered it when I was in the Philippines. The server taught us how to make the sauce for it (mixture of banana ketchup, Tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce). With that sauce, my boyfriend's seasoning comment went away. He loved it.  2.) LECHON KAWALI - Loved it!!!! I ate a lot!!! Perfectly cooked.  3.) PANSIT - Delicious!!! 4.) BUKO PANDAN - It came in a sundae cup. It has ice cream with it. Delicious!!!! 5.) PORK SISIG - It was ok. I'd rather wait to go to Gerry's Grill in LA for some great sisig. 6.) HALO HALO - Delicious!!! 7.) CRISPY PATA - Awesome!!! 8.) GARLIC FRIED RICE - Just okay. It's not the fried rice I was expecting. 9.) SPAGHETTI - It was pretty good. Just a bit step up from Jollibee's. I'd rather order something else. 10.) SOUP OF THE DAY - The ones we got are pretty good. Perfect way to start a meal.  Tip: If you're a big group, tell them from the start that you'll have separate bills. The one in our group said they had a nightmare before because they only mentioned that in the end.  Again, service is great. Same as how I remembered Max's service is in the Philippines. We got seated right away. The server didn't pressure us to order right away. We got a lot of refills. Waiters are willing to serve us even if it's not their table. The manager went to our table twice and even took our dessert order. Everybody greeted us on our way out.   My boyfriend and I were discussing why the heck it has 3 stars. He said most of the reviews were when they first opened and were about the price. Here's the thing: Max's is really supposed to be an elevated version of traditional Filipino cuisine. How can you expect other ethnicities to respect our cuisine the same way they regard Thai or Japanese cuisine if you don't elevate it? Why would always equate Filipino food with cheap cafeteria food? Yes, I like carinderia food (like Tita's in San Diego), but we always want to present the best of our food in a refined way. And of course, having better versions of our food mean higher prices. For example, you don't expect to pay cheap for a good Italian pasta. Same thing with Filipino cuisine. I think we should support these kinds of restaurants so we can proliferate elevated version of traditional Filipino cuisine.   Update on my comment about past reviews: I talked to our waiter. He said that they had a horrible start because they didn't expect the huge crowds that came in when they first opened. He said that compromised the quality of their food because they have to make a huge amount of food in a short span of time. It's pretty normal now.  Haven't had bad experience yet so 4 stars.  Last note: I wish they didn't close the Max's in San Diego, CA. They should open one in Mira Mesa, a classier area of SD with a high concentration of upper middle class Filipinos. Or Eastlake area. I'll be sad when I move out of Vegas. Anyway, we'll be back!!!! I'll take my parents here when they visit me since they rarely go to LA on their own anyway. I'm so happy to have found Max's in Vegas.",

    "text": "So I can't help but agree with the previous post on all the complainers.  The wait is ridiculous BUT THEY JUST OPENED, it does come with the hype and territory people!         I give 5 stars for the food.  The chicken was worth the anticipation and what I remembered from my trip to P.I two years ago.  That and it definitely satisfied my pregnant cravings!!!  I ordered the Fiesta plater and sisig.   The chicken was juicy and tender in the inside, and had a nice seasoned crunch on the outside.  The fresh lumpia was a nice contrast to the pallet.  The Sisig on the other hand was a bit disappointing to me because it had ears,  I guess I got too excited, and didn't fully read the description...lesson learned!  We did not get out caramel bars...but I guess that was the reason our waiter subbed out for ice cream.        Service from our waiter great.  I didn't expect to much again because we were sat at 8:30...close to closing and the place was still packed.  However Jerry was awesome and attentive in any way he could.   He even made a sauce for us at our table to eat with our chicken!             So why 4 stars?  To my understanding they have been open for \"Soft Opening\" since last week, between the hours 4-9.   In my opinion that's one long soft opening!  At this point they should consider opening normal business hours to help decrease wait time in the evening.  It was 1h+ wait time when we arrived.  They were taking \"To Go\" orders also, maybe during \"Soft Opening\" stage this isn't the smartest move; again they are only open for 4 hours ATM.  The kitchen got to the point were they were at a halt and orders were stopped for a bit so they could catch up.  So maybe until they are fully opened, To Go orders should wait.         Anyways I am looking forward to coming back.  Overall experience was worth it...a few hick ups but a lot of great potential.",

The garlic rice smells great and has the right dry but soft texture. Pancit palabok was also good.  Thank goodness the food tasted good.  I would give the food 4 stars alone. The tab for two of us came out to $31.24.  If only the service here was as good as the food. I was really unhappy sitting at our table waiting 45min to eat.

My major problem was the food. I've tried Max's before but that was in the Philippines so my expectations were high. We ordered Fiesta platter and Max's Platter it came to our table fairly quickly maybe about less than 20 minutes. Now I know why, it was cold! My mom thought that maybe it was just hers and the fact that we just had halo halo (which was good you cant mess up halo halo right?), no my sister's food was cold also so was mine. the only thing that was hot was the chicken and it wasnt impressive. Maybe they need more practice or training or what have you, but I do know we won't be going back since my mom got sick after eating there. Save yourself time, just go to DT's so much better.",

I ordered the whole chicken, tapsilog breakfast, Pancit bihon, beef soup, stir fry beef, milkfish breakfast, garlic rice, fried calamari. Out of all these dishes the calamari sucked, they should just stop serving it. Everything else was really good, especially the tapsilog.",

I've tried most of the menu here (fried chicken, chicken inasal plate, sweet and sour fish filet, pinakbet, oxtail kare kare, pancit bihon, lechon kawali, and crispy pata). I would say all the food is tastes very good. Get the LECHON KAWALI! You will not be disappointed! And one more thing, their halo halo is the best restaurant version i've tasted.",

I enjoyed Maxs while in the Philippines and this one is just as good in a very nice setting. You can't go wrong with the chicken adobo, garlic rice, fried chicken, pancit or lechon kawali. All are very tasty and served in perfect portions for sharing. The staff is very friendly and warm which isn't surprising since great hospitality is common with most Filipino businesses.",

Did not register that this was the MAX's restaurant originally from the Philippines or the same one in Honolulu, Hawaii! Brand new restaurant. Service was great. We went at 6:00 pm - ish. For me, adobo was so good! Extra is the garlic rice, but still, it was SO good, I went back AGAIN by myself and ate at the bar. I finished the WHOLE thing and I was full. So good. I am glad that this restaurant is here and the outside lit sign says \"Cuisine of the Philippines\". It was nice to see some Caucasians in the restaurant (with no Filipinos with them). It seemed like they were enjoying the food also. Big families, big tables, nice atmosphere. Waiters seemed always wanting to please. I spoke to the hostess and said I hoped the restaurant was doing well, and she said it was!",

We usually don't like any Filipino restaurants bc we always think our mom can make it at home way better. I was happy about this restaurant, service was great and fast and most importantly, the food was great (still not comparable to mom's)! We ordered the crab fried rice and it was a simple dish - typical fried rice topped with a crab omelette meant to mixes with rice. We also ordered the sinigang na hipon which is also good but could've been more sour. We also ordered the karekare with bagoong and it's one of my favorite entrees. My two most favorite that we ordered was the pritong bangus and the pork sisig!! The fish was cooked right and it has a citrusy flavor to it and the best best one -- the sisig! It came in a sizzling plate with lemon wedges and it was crunchy in the bottom with right amount of onions and jalapenos, it was so good I'm dreaming about it now. For the dessert, we of course ordered the halo-halo. It was what I expected, toppings, milky shaved ice and the ube ice cream but it was yummy and we finished it too after we are everything else! This is a great meeting place for my family and I; will definitely go back when I'm in town again.",
