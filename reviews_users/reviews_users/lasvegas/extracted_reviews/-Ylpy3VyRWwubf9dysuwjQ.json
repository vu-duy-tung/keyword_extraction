Two groups were next to each other. The other group was across a walkway. We were fortunate to get the waiter who was probably new. He seemed to be a little panicked while the other waiter looked like he knew what he was doing. As for the group I was in, we had to wait a long time between ordering our drinks then ordering our food. This cause us to be the last finishing our food while the other group was ready to head out the door. Other than the service, the food was as expected...Good! I give the food four out of five stars. Service was a two out of five.",

Honestly, their food is decent, but too plain in my opinion, I wasn't wowed by anything.    The first time I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, which was tasty, but again, nothing crazy.  Second time I had pasta with meat sauce, maybe my fault fault for not ordering something more exotic, but again nothing I couldn'tve made at home.  The meals are at least affordable.  And while their HUUUGE portions could be a plus for some people, I really think they should scale them down a bit.  Seriously, we were a party of 9, and I think the food we didn't finish could've fed a company of soldiers for a day.  And we ordered one entree each with two or three appetizers to share.    One last thing that made me give them 3 stars was that a buddy of mine ordered Eggs Benedict, and the thing came drenched in Hollandaise sauce.  Literally, you couldn't see what was underneath.    Anyways, just like the rating says, A-OK, but I wouldn't go there again with everything else that Vegas has to offer.",

One of the biggest pluses about this place is the selection, they have so much on their menu across all types of cuisine that it's literally in a spiral bound notebook.  I kept getting a four cheese pasta until I asked the waiter for other suggestions and since then, I have still never been disappointed with the food.  I don't come here as often as I like since the locations are far away and the wait is normally long, but it is well worth all of that for the food!",

You can generally expect to have a good wait time to get into a seat because the food is awesome. Do not mistake this wait time for poor service because it's generally anything besides lacking.   At this one in particular, you can be seated on one of three floors or even out in the forum shops where you can watch the fish tanks and the robotic Atlantis show. It's in the middle of all the forum shop stores at a dead end, so you really have to want to get there to find it. It's worth every second. I stayed in Vegas for a week for a convention, ate here 5 times then, and still didn't have the same thing.  They'll start by bringing you a little bread, and all of it is worth trying out and making sure that they've got more coming for you.  The drinks that they'll offer are pretty varied, from general bar items to very specialty drinks, but sometimes the beer selection is lacking oddly enough.  Appetizers are delicious and as you can expect to find throughout the entire menu, it's all over the place. You can get a dozen kinds of pizza or chicken or a delicious pasta for that matter.   The main event though is of course.....the cheesecakes. I try to order a different one each time that I've gone in, but I've been to different locations dozens of times, and I haven't eaten the same one twice yet.   Enjoy!",

The chicken was tender and crispy at the same time and the pesto pasta was perfect! The bread arrived warm and soft with a crispy crust. The service was great and our drinks were topped without any prompting. The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the chopped salad was a tad over dressed. Also, we've been to the Cheesecake factory several times and it's not consistently 5 stars.",

They gave us the runaround for at least 1.5hrs regarding when we'd be seated.  We tried to kill time in the mall but it truly was a painful wait.  It was moderately frustrating to watch people show up, eat a meal and leave.  Aside from this, everything else was great.  The Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad is massive and I had second meal with my leftovers.  The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake is tart and delicious.  I wasn't expecting the crust to include coconut.  I do think they add waaaay too much whipped cream to the plate.  Most people who had desert hardly touched it and it seems like a huge waste.       Our server was friendly and swift.  I don't know if this is normal because they may have been kissing our butt due to the seating issue.  Either way, the experience once we sat down was lovely and I'd definitely return, with a much smaller group this time.  I wouldn't go back with a party larger than 4 or 6.",

But I just couldn't resist eating at The Cheesecake Factory!   We were looking for a place to eat breakfast/lunch on a Saturday morning, and so many of the restaurants were packed and had 45-minute waits. So we walked around the Forum Shops, and there was The Cheesecake Factory, a beacon amid a sea of overpriced stores! We had to go in. And get this: No wait for a table!  We sat upstairs on the second floor. This place is huge, by the way. Plenty of seating.   Their menu is also huge, so bring your reading glasses. For an appetizer, we ordered the Made-to-Order Guacamole, which was very good and came with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream - all of the necessary condiments to go along with chips!  For an entree, I got the Southwest Chicken Sandwich, which had grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro and chipotle mayo on Toasted French bread. It's also served with jalapenos, but I asked that they don't put them on there, and I'm glad I did because this sandwich definitely had a kick to it. It was really good, though, and I used some of the leftover guacamole from our appetizer on my sandwich, which made it extra good.   Then, of course, we had to get cheesecake. I got the Carmel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. Amazing! The perfect ending to a great meal.",

I had been saving The cheesecake factory for a special occasion b/c I dont routinely order dessert.   ENTREE: I ordered the cobb salad which I would never ever order again. Ive had better cobb salads @ Big Dogs! This salad was 95%lettuce with anything else as an afterthought. I coudl count the # of blue cheese crumbles and pieces of what appeard to be walmart deli sliced turkey on my salad. I was not happy..what a waste of $13.00 I'd rather have had wendy's cobb and that isnt very good either.  my bf ordered the chicken Bellagio. OMG 2000 calories but it tasted divine. Basil infused pasta with some sort of lemon ckin on top. Good but Too caloric.   DESSERT: Yum. OMG.. as my Julio (my love) would say, \"this had wedding cake written all over it!!\" we ordered the Red-Velvet Cheesecake. there. are. no. words. I cannot begin to tell you how utterly delicious and marvelous this dessert was. So decadent and sinful yet not too sweet and not so crazy. LOVED IT. We'd come back just for dessert in the future and since his bday is coming up we just might do that.   SERVICE: eh.. it was ok. What I never understood is why when you have a table of at least 6 people, odds are it maybe 3 couples especially if you see there are 3 females and 3 males. maybe. so why on earth would you assume in your infinite wisdom and experience servicing the restaurant industry that one person is going to pay the entire tab? We are going to split this up b/c thats what coupes do. and instead of making this awkward for everyone involved. please ask us if we would like to split this up one 1 ticket or 2 or 3? and make this easier for everyone. at the beginning of the meal. this has annoyed me for years with large restaurants such as this.   end thought: order dessert. go light on food .. split a pizza and go for the dessert!",

This one had an outside patio for dining with a view of the pretty fish tank! Nice!  For this time around, I had ordered The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich with grilled Japanese eggplant, roasted bell peppers, red onions, melted mozzarella and garlic aioli on a toasted bun with a side of sweet potato fries. I asked the waitress if she would order my sandwich with the aioli on the side. When my dish arrive, I noticed that they did not place the aioli on the side (I am thinking that the waitress forgot to note it down), that  the eggplant was cut in quarters instead of being sliced thinly. What's the big deal, right? Well my Yelpers, trying to eat a chunk of an oily grilled eggplant inside a toasted bun smeared with garlic aioli and melted cheese and slippery grilled peppers makes it difficult to handle and eat. The eggplant kept slipping off my sandwich every time I took a bite. Hence, I decided to just take it off my sandwich and have a roasted pepper and cheese sandwich and eat the eggplant on the side. If they would change the cut of the eggplant, then the sandwich would definitely no be as messy to eat and enjoy, especially if you are paying like $15!  I tried the Chicken Madeira from a friend's plate. The chicken was very tender and juicy and the sauce was not too salty or bland, perfect! I also tried her mashed potatoes and loved that you can taste real potatoes! Definitely not potatoes out of the box and then scooped onto your plate haha. Great portion for two meals! Now that's a bargain. My friend, however, ordered the plate with no asparagus and it came with it anyhow. Thus, the waitress forgot to note it down as well.   Overall, great dining experience! Service was okay since the waitress kept forgetting minor details and tried to get us to keep buying dessert even after we were obviously full and in a bit of a rush. She did bring us ton of bread to eat though.  I",

And, because we told her late that it was my brother's birthday, he got a free piece of cheesecake instead of the usual sundae. Yea Heidi!",

Also, I think the Cajun Rib-eye is the best kept secret in the business. Why? Its better than an outback porterhouse, by far, its not too expensive, and it has a huge serving size. They marinate these behemoths for at least 24hrs and in the end you wind up with a huge, juicy, tender steak broiled not too badly. YUMM.",

We ordered:  1) Calamari was well deep fried and cooked but no real flavor by itself or with sauce. 2) Ahi tartare was very small and only for one person. Had a lot of avocado, more then ahi tuna and the sauce was just right with the wonton chips. 3) Buffalo wings were good and well deep fried with ranch. 4) Fried Zucchini was good and well cooked. Love their ranch as it seemed homemade. 5) Loaded potato tots were good and filled with bacon,cheese,potatoes,etc but you can only have so much. I could not eat too much of this as it almost made me sick. 6) Plain cheese cake with warm chocolate sauce is always my fave!  My rating is more a 3.5 stars but had to round up. I would come back but we need to watch what we order! ;-)",

    "text": "First, the Service. Party of 11: Four adults and the rest under 21: Occasion:  B-day party. The wait time was to be an hour.  It was more like 35 minutes.  Polite front desk and friendly. Seating was prompt and without hassle.   Our server - Sheena.  The epitome of exceptional customer service.  Sheena is the kind of employee that employers try to keep guarded from other employers trying to poach such employees. The kind of employee every business owner desires.  An employee that instills such a great experience on patrons/customers - that it keeps them coming back.   Sheena greeted our party with professionalism, courtesy, all smiles, articulate, and just the right amount of chatter.  She came across as a seasoned server that knew the exact amount of exchange and pleasantries necessary to make everyone feel welcomed.  From taking our orders for drinks and appetizers on to the main entree and desert.  Our drinks were always topped off and our table cleared of used glasses, plates and empty bread baskets only to be replenished without delay. Not a single person had to request service.  Sheena was always one step ahead.   Thinking of pepper?  Too late, Sheena is already asking.  Shredded cheese?  Too late - Sheena is already behind you with cheese shredder just waiting for your affirmation.  Question about the food?  Yup, Sheena is there with an articulate explanation of options/make-up of the entree.   I remember trying to think of any additional request - but Sheena was there - one step ahead.  We were so lucky to have been served by this great person.  Such a delight to have as our server.    She worked our table like a ballerina - with the most exquisite detail to service. From the youngest patron, a 7 year old to my mother - everyone spoke highly of Sheena's performance.  The food, our drinks, deserts, everything was better due to Sheena's service.   The Food - Most started off with sot-drinks, while I enjoyed a Moscow Mule.  No copper mug but the Mule had a kick to it and not watered down.  For appetizers, we indulged in stuffed mushrooms, fried zucchini, calamari and artichoke?  The stuffed mushrooms were perfect and the fried zucchini was perfectly presented.  Just the right amount of crisp.   The Entrees included Chicken Madeira, Four Cheese Pasta (a favorite at the table), Steak Diane Scampi Combo, Fettucini Alfredo, Chicken Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips, Chicken Littles, and an assortment of other salads.  The Chicken Littles was quite the opposite of little.  My poor niece, who probably weighs less than 60lbs got full by just looking at the mountain of food on her plate.  It was an inordinate amount - much more than the typical Cheesecake Factory portion.  The food was very good.  Of course, we enjoyed our meal more due to the great service provided by Sheena.   For appetizers the selection was diverse - Snickers Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Cheesecake, 30th Anniversary Cheesecake (this is the one item I had second thoughts on - I should have ordered the Oreo Dream Cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary didn't have the sugar kick that accompanied the Oreo Cheesecake), Salted Caramel - probably one of the best choices for deserts, and the Birthday Sunday for the Birthday girl.  Served with black coffee to conclude this exceptional experience.   Thank you Cheesecake Factory and above it all - Sheena - just wow!  Thank you so much!  Entire family appreciate and thank you for the exceptional service.  Truly a unique experience.  That 30% tip should have been at least 50%.  Well deserved. Thank you again.   The Arroyo family.",

They seemed to be understaffed as wait times once seated were long, and a couple errors were made (olives forgotten on pizza, request for no whip cream forgotten, etc).   I ate the avocado egg rolls app - these are made fresh at the restaurant. The egg rolls were crispy on the outside and the tamarind sauce paired well with it - tasty mix of sweet/tangy.   For dessert, I had the Cookie Dough cheesecake - super dense and delicious.    A couple friends shared Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake which was tasty but a bit too much going on for me (brownie, cake, coconut, chocolate chips, cheesecake).",

If you complain you'll be moved to the booth next to the Bus Boy Credenza (where waiters grab for utensils.) Go ahead, bet you I'm right.  Has to be a Cheesecake policy-- both places? Listen to those forks and knives thrown into those drawers twenty, thirty at a time. Wonderful! Isn't it?   Server (woman about 50-60's) comes over to take order. She says, and I am quoting, \"So,\" as she turns toward me, her shoulders framing me out, \"Let's start with the gentleman.\"   I said, \"No, let's start with the ladies.\"  She was absolutely taken aback, instantly disturbed. Look on her face could kill.    Sorry, but a gentleman always lets the ladies order first. It's not sexist. It's respect.",

Especially the manager on duty who fixed a minor table issue, and our waitress who felt like a friend hosting a party. Unfortunately I did not get their names.

I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory so many times in California because it is one of my favorite restaurants for the quality and taste of food, consistency, and service.   I always order a BBQ chicken salad every time I visit the Cheesecake Factory. The one I had in Vegas ruined this dish for me.  The salad was not fresh. The cucumbers were all soggy. Not only that, I found 4-5 lettuce head ends in my salad?! I've never experienced this, EVER!!!! Upon calling my server and showing him this, asking him if this is normal he stated \" a few can get in there but not this many\" he just asked if I was done with my salad, cleared the napkin I had with the lettuce heads and proceeded to bring my check. Exceptional service... buddy. Oh and thanks not checking up on us once during our entire dinner.....So disappointed!!!!",

    "text": "So tonight was CONFUSING. I walked in, gave my name, waited by the bakery. My name was called. I was told to walk upstairs. I waited AGAIN upstairs. And then asked to sit in an overcrowded, stuffy, overflow room.  And get this, the table was a small 2 top right outside of the kitchen. Literally, 3 steps out of the kitchen. Lord forbid a waiter trip or a cup of coffee slip off of a tray, scolded wouldn't even be the word.  Myself and my guest I was with, just left.   As we walked down the grand staircase, we walked past a manager that didn't even take the time to say goodbye or ask about the meal. The gentleman that directed us upstairs didn't even take the time to ask why we were leaving so soon, but instead \"I hope you enjoyed your meal!\" Bro, we weren't even here for more than 10 minutes.  Ultimately, I get that this location in Vegas is busy, but why is that? Cheesecake factory is a staple in every major city, patrons will eat there no matter what city they are traveling to.  But what i don't get is how the customer service can waiver between the different locations.  Just because the Vegas location stays packed from open to close, shouldn't mean that the hostess cannot take an extra moment while asking a name, \"just to let you know, we are seating in the upstairs overflow room, is that okay? Or would you prefer to wait for a table on the first floor?\"  This one question would have given me a 5 star experience because I would have elected to walk up approximately 42 stairs and sit in a separated environment.",

The menu is huge and everything I've ever tried is delicious. The portions are also huge and the price is extremely reasonable. Make sure to take a doggy bag because you MUST save room for dessert! Their cheesecake is heavenly! We had the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and I've never tasted something so delicious in my life.   The service is also always great here as well and they give you bread before your meal.   What more could you want in a restaurant. My only criticism is that they don't have any locations in Canada. I beg you Cheesecake Factory, please come to Canada!",

However it was getting late and I needed to get dinner at a place where I knew exactly what to what to order. Service was fast, but not too fast. I asked for only the whole wheat bread and they accommodated me.  The only downside to the place was that I got no signal at all on my phone. I wasn't the only one with that problem. That's not The Cheesecake Factory's fault, but it would be nice if they installed WiFi in the restaurant.",

We stopped in for a bite while shopping.   We got a salad which was gigantic.  The waitress was great. Very helpful. My wife always wants something changed and the waitress was more than happy to accommodate.  Nothing we asked for. Was unreasonable. The only bad thing about the salad was the quality of the tomatoes in the salad.    I do not think they were cut fresh. I suspect they are food pack pre diced tomatoes because they were so bland and mushy.   The four stars reflects the service we got. The food was more of a 2.5  We will definitely be back. Next time substituting the tomatoes for something else.",

When the buzzer rings we go and wait to be seated by the same waiter for which she progresses to seat us inside and not at the table for which we waited for. We notify her of this issue and she says he will correct it in 5 mins. She then brings her manager to assist and the same waiter claims to have never seen us before and that she doesn't remember helping us so she looks like a good employee in front of her manager. We tried to file a complaint but conveniently for her, the office was closed today. Hope this helps for anyone looking to dine at what someone would expect to have satisfactory service. Overall terrible service even before we were seated so we figured if they won't help us prior to our meal, why trust them?",

Dined in on the 21st of December for my baby sisters birthday and this location had the perfect vibe, music and staff. Our server Jeff was a delight so definitely ask for him when you're there!  Their Avocado Egg Rolls served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce is to die for! If you haven't had it yet and want a savoury appetiser, it's the best choice. Egg Rolls were fresh, crunchy and the sauce is delicious; If they bottled it and sell it, I'd definitely buy.   For my entree, I had the yummy Evelyn's Favourite Pasta; rigatoni tossed with so many veggies and topped with a pesto.   I also got the Vegan Cobb Salad, which by the way is HUGE, so I definitely recommend sharing it!   Last but not least, my favourite part... the Cheesecake. You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get Cheesecake, that's just wrong. So I had a slice of the Celebration Cheesecake and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake to go.",

As a large party and almost guaranteed a phat tip we were still treated pretty well.  I got the tuna and my friend got the miso salmon.  For some reason my tuna was cooked so you could see gray/white throughout, the last two times I had it where my tuna was red/rose.  I don't know what the norm is but they made it the way I wanted.    You have to limit yourself to the food because the best part is the dessert!  It's not called Cheesecake Factory because of the pasta or meat or fish.  There are no items on the menu with name's like Cheesecake ahi tuna or Cajun Cheesecake Jumbalaya but White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle or Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake!  Mmmm!!  So my fav: Miso Salmon!!  Wasabi Encrusted Ahi Tuna!!!!  Steak Diane!  Cajun Jambalaya Pasta!  And the above Cheesecakes!",

For a non-sushi restaurant, it is not surprising to get a bad order of tuna that has been sitting around just a bit too long, but Cheesecake Factory has never let me down.  Today I deviated from my usual Garlic Shrimp Pasta, and tried the Enchiladas.  3 nicely done tortillas filled with chicken, and smothered in melted cheese, with a side of beans and cilantro rice.  Great fuel for the long walking distances in Vegas!",

I abso-freakin-lutely love this show so you can imagine how stoked I was to find this place.   Nothing else mattered at that moment... I had to try it!  I went there twice and loved it both times. The First time was for dinner (and dessert as well merci beaucoup!) - I had their kobe burger w/ fries and it was pretty good. For dessert, I had their original cheesecake w/ Graham Cracker Crust and Sour Cream topping.... So good!  The second I went was in sometime in the morning and all I wanted was another cheesecake so I sat down and said to the waiter: \"Cheesecake please..\" He recommended the Vanilla Bean cheesecake so I went with that and it was amazing!  I wish we had one in Melbourne.. I really like it - the staff are very nice, I like the setup (nothing too formal nor too casual). It's a great place to chill and the price is quite reasonable too... I highly recommend it.",

They finally seat us after 15 minutes (as we are still waiting for the 2 in our party). They give us 2 booths back to back. We wanted a table together. We saw 2 tables so we asked our waitress if we could connect the tables and sit together so she went to go ask. In the meantime we start setting up the tables. The manager (Amid which refused to give us his full name) walks up to all EIGHT of us (this is the first time I've seen this man) with an attitude and starts saying very rudely get up, no this is not what we agreed on either move tables or don't dine with us and get out. My sister calmly says we did not agree on anything and I have never seen you before. I dealt with the hostess. He says no no no and does not let my sister finish her statement as were walking away my brother asks what is your name I'm leaving a review he says Amid we then ask what is your last name he then proceeded to say I will not tell you we go back and forth for five minutes then says get out or I'll call security. Now to me this is no way to manage a restaurant I felt disrespected.  I would definitely not recommend this location!",

It's nice & big but because it's on the strip in the forum shops, the wait to get seated is kind of long. They have to call us on our cellphone to let us know when seating is available.  When you get inside, it feels kind of cramped. It took a longer time then normal to get our orders taken. The have a big menu. So much to choose from. They even have a menu for people watching their calories.    For refreshments, I had the strawberry lemonade. It was super tangy. Very strong flavor. I'm not sure if it's just me because I'm pregnant & my taste buds are more sensitive or it really is just super sour.  It took a long time to get our food & honestly it wasn't very satisfying. Our appetizers were ok. I had the eggplant Parmesan & it was bland but the linguini noodles was super salty. I couldn't finish my meal.

    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Forum Shops of Ceasar's palace, way in the back behind the Zeus moving statues (keep this in mind when sitting outside, the show is every hour on the hour and gets loud!). We went to the Cheesecake Factory, having never been to one before. As it was in Caesars Palace, I was expecting inflated prices, however I was pleasantly surprised with the menu pricing.  The spinach, artichoke and cheese dip was great and the pizza and jerk chicken for main were both fresh and tasty. We took a slice of cheesecake to go (too full to eat after the starter and main) and it was lovely. The price level was decent, especially considering the quality of food you get. A good experience! Our waiter was fast and friendly and offered advice on the huge menu (I mean it when I say there is something for everyone!!).   My husband had the Meatballs, my sister had a pizza and I had a steak. All the meals were well prepared and very well presented. My steak was cooked as I like it, medium rare. Following the meal we chose deserts and again they were really nice, and surprising value. The low light was the Fettucine Alfredo. Very little sauce, very little flavour. Very disappointing.  Both the meal and desert portions were large, perhaps a little too large for me and I have a great apatite. The portion and value are great here and the food is very decent, though not so much on the healthy side (they do have a 'skinny menu' meant for those who are calorie conscious).  The service was excellent and our server was very conscientious, always making sure we had rinks topped up etc.  All in all, the title says it all. 'Good Food, Good Value - Great Evening'  We will definitely return to here.",

Now....I understand that people can be overwhelmed but no other cheesecakes who handles the same amount of stress would treat us the way he did. I'm am shocked. I literally don't want to support cheesecake if this is what they allow to handle the customers and certain circumstances. I would think a manager is hired to handle special situations accordingly.

My boyfriend order a Long Island ice tea and I got a mojito. The mojito a was delicious ! We got the macaroni and cheese appetizer and since we were there for dessert the tiramisu cheese was our goal. The service was amazing and the atmosphere was relax since it was almost closing time.",

I like this place because it reminds me a tad bit of the Grand Lux cafe. I am a cheesecake lover so the variety of cheesecakes that they have to offer are superb! The customer service here is always great from the many times I have visited. This location being inside of Caesars Palace so of course you know they have to step it up! For the food my friends and I ordered the Hot Spinach and Cheese dip along with the Fried Mac'n cheese bites for the appetizers. If you are into burgers at all look under the \"Glamburgers\" on the menu and try out the Macaroni and Cheese Burger! Sounds weird but trust me it has to be the best burger on the menu! Thai Chicken Pasta followed by the Miso Salmon were the remainder of dishes we ordered! Nobody had any complaints! I guess you can say it was a successful dinner, but wait.. that's not it! You can't come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get some cheesecake for desert! My favorite is the Red Velvet and Tiramisu! As I mentioned earlier there are plenty of options to choose from so do your taste buds a favor and indulge in one of them!",

I had the chicken bellagio, and it was delicious. My husband had the chicken madeira, and he loved it too. The portions were gigantic though, and it feels like such a waste. I only managed to eat about half. We shared the chocolate mousse cheesecake and the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake, and both were amazing. I'm always impressed when such a big and busy (and afforable) restaurant can produce food this good.   Be warned the location can be a bit noisy, and I definetly recommend being seated inside. It's a busy place as well, but we only had to wait 15 minutes to be seated when we came on a Monday night.",

Seriously you have to try it! For my main course meal I choose Evelyn's favorite pasta! Now I can say why it was her favorite! It's now mines too! Lol pasta was more of a vegan dish since it had  Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Garlic and Pine Nuts. Ahh sooo good! And lastly for dessert my server suggested to try out their tiramisu cake, I enjoyed it it was full of flavor very moist and could definitely taste the coffee the only bad thing I'd say was the waiting time it took about 50 mins to be seated we were given a receipt with a check back in time. We however used that time to walk and browse around the forum shops :)",

We have never had a bad experience, the food is always very good, Portions are good. This is one of those places if your in Caesars Palace you just want to eat at because you know the food is good. I hate trying new places and getting ripped off! Here you never feel like your ripped off. You may go home with some of your food if you aren't real hungry. Over all we Highly recommend this place, you can not go wrong eating here!!",

The worst part was he just blatantly ignored me knowing I was upset, no manager in sight and no one that cared. Left hungry, will go find food somewhere else, I am  a frequenter here but will step away for a bit.",

    "text": "Happy 400th Review and I am dedicating #400 to The Cheesecake Factory.  Why The Cheesecake Factory?  The Reason: This Cheesecake Factory location holds special memories I will never ever forget, I celebrated most of my anniversaries here at this Cheesecake Factory location, the very first celebration was our 7th, which I remember like it was yesterday. We have been back every year,since our 7th. That's many anniversaries here!!   This recent anniversary was our 21st Anniversary and I wanted to keep the tradition going.  Although we do have a Cheesecake factory in Hawaii, which I need the energy, to get to Waikiki and with the very long wait, I don't really visit this location back home often.  This is why, I really look forward to February, our Anniversary.   I Really do enjoy all my visits to this Cheesecake Factory location, located in the Forum Shops at Caesars adjacent to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip far north side of the mall. This Cheesecake Factory is HUGE with 2 levels. During my recent visit, we got our table right away after checking in with the hostess, we went after the dinner rush, which was close to 8 pm.   We always end up ordering our usual, but I still like to glance thru the famous 10 page storybook menu with 200 menu items. I like to see what new items are available. The loaded baked potato tots sounded tempting so I also got that along with our usual.   Here is what we always order, our anniversary tradition.   Fried Calamari, came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce, They make the best fried calamari, cooked just right, light and crisp.   Did you know that Cheesecake Factory has Miso Salmon?  Our entree are the Miso Salmon X 2, fresh salmon marinated in miso, served with snow peas and white rice. I always request well done on my salmon. The miso sauce, rice, & snow peas just went so great together. We enjoyed this entree.   Loaded baked potato tots, Crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon, & green onion, served with sour cream. I didn't care for this tots, I was expecting tots with the stuff separate, like nachos style. It was too rich, we didn't finish this tots.   We always get our alcoholic beverage and we need to make room for cheesecake. Never leave Cheesecake Factory with out eating a cheesecake, that's too crazy!  The grand finale : cheesecake, deciding on what cheesecake to get is the hard part, with tons of flavors to choose from, My wonderful hubby always lets me choose, we are too stuffed to have our own cheesecake.  For our anniversary cake, I went with the salted caramel, enjoying every delicious bite.   Note: for any celebration, Cheesecake factory will decorate your cheesecake, free of charge.  About Cheesecake Factory:  *Established in 1978 by Evelyn and Oscar Overton *The first Cheesecake Factory was founded in 1978, in Beverly Hills, California, by David Overton *There are over 150 Cheesecake Factory locations *The success of The Cheesecake Factory is a great American success story  Overall, we always enjoy our visits here at this Cheesecake location and looking forward to many more! Thank you Cheesecake factory for a memorable celebration.   Happy 400th & Happy 21st!!  #41/100 for 2017",

We sat on the terrace and it was great for people watching.  Ordered the Smoke House BBQ burger (Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Onion Strings, Ranch BBQ). This burger was pretty enormous and mighty tasty. Bacon & onion rings were crispy. The patty was juicy medium. It came with fries so this was definitely a filling lunch for $12. My friend got the Factory Burger and said that it was also good.  Service was swift and polite. Got seated in 5 minutes and food came in a timely manner. We were there on a Monday so weekends are probably a lot busier from reading other reviews.",

It was a bit dark, so we used our phones for the light on our menu's. Others were using their phones, so it wasn't just us. The food was excellent. We had the Chicken Piccata, and one of the other chicken dishes. They were both excellent. The Chicken in both dishes was good. Thin and cooked perfectly, and the seasons on each piece of chicken was great. We ended with a big piece of Cheese Cake. The dinner was good. The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that its consistent and the food is always good. It's a simple go-to place for me. (when in doubt)",

Nice view out there, but then again another 10 minutes to get my order.  The food in my option wasn't all that great.  I will not be coming back here.",

It's super busy, so the wait was about an hour or more. But they have cool attractions and stores close by. The fish tanks out front is very appealing. My daughter enjoyed walking around looking at the fishes.Cheesecake Factory's location within Caesars Palace is a prime locations because there is just so much to see. Caesars Palace had a greek god show (not sure if they have it all the time) but the show was cool. We got to watch it as we ate.   The service wasn't that great because they were super busy. The food took awhile to come out. When it did come out, some of it was cold. I guess they wanted to wait for everything to be ready before they brought it out. But it was just too busy for us to ask them to heat up our food, considering we waited an hour to order and about 40 mins for our food to come out. Needless to say we still enjoyed our food. We are big Cheesecake Factory lovers. And the greek gods show definitely helped to keep us entertained.  I would recommend Cheesecake Factory. Just remember if you choose to eat here, be prepared to wait.",

She asked if we wanted bread and we said no. She came back with bread and said they only had wheat. Good thing because it was almost an hour later before we got our food. I ordered a small Caesar salad with no croutons...but it came with croutons. She offered to take it back but I didn't want to wait any longer. Quicker to just pick them out. We ordered lettuce chicken tacos and edamame. We were wondering why these items took so long to be served. We ended up asking for our cheesecakes to go to save time. Nothing wrong with our food but was kind of full because of munching on bread while waiting a long time. Carrot and low carb Cheesecake were delicious as expected.",

Don't remember our server's name but he was very nice and although he had to go through many other people's tables he went through everyone's table saying he had many tables to serve to warn us in case he may take quite a while. The food was very good! This Cheesecake Factory isn't like the ones I've been to back at home because they have more food options like calamari and nachos which my parents tried out and loved it! I went for the basic carbonara pasta with shrimp which is good as well! To top it all off, my server gave me a cheesecake and sang happy birthday!

I've ordered items like the Factory Burger($12.95)that were to DIE for and some items like the Cuban sandwich($13.95) that were terribly disgusting. Nonetheless, I keep coming back for more.   The portions here could feed 3 people, no joke. The prices are high because of the enormously insane portion sizes. (Not as big as Hash House A Go-Go but still huge)   My favorite item thus far: the Eggplant Parmesan!!! ($15.50)The flavor is fantastic. The marinara sauce and fontina cheese that's layered  on the crisp eggplant \"lasagna style\" is wonderful. It's not too salty which is a plus. The pesto pasta doesn't overpower the dish itself either.   Eva, the cashier at the bakery counter is such a sweetheart! She's always super helpful with special requests and additional sauces if needed. AND she's always smiling!   Overall, you CAN go wrong at this place but with my help....that won't happen!!",

No, it doesn't have the charm and the allure but it does offer a wide ranging menu that is sure to please, decent service, and most off all: consistency.   The menu is overwhelmingly large. Whether you want appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, entrees, or more they will have it. Tacos? Shepherd's Pie? Chicken Milenese? Yes, they have it available on their menu. While it won't be the greatest you ever had, it certainly won't be disappointing and offers decent flavors.   Service was good and like other locations, its saving grace. We were the last party to be seated and they didn't hesitate to be of service nor did they try to rush us. They were attentive and water glasses never went empty. The food arrived in a well timed orchestration and was where the restaurant clearly shined.  All in all it was consistent. It stayed True to the Cheesecake Factory experience and didn't disappoint, yet at the same time didn't wow either.",

We went for lunch on a Tuesday and did not have a wait to get seated (yay!).  The prices of items on the menu were surprisingly very reasonable.  The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  My husband had a buffalo burger and fries.  He said it tasted great and was very filling.  I had the herb crusted filet of salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  I was very pleased with it; tasted fresh and delicious.  For desert we shared the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  Holy. Cow. It was so good.  You must eat desert when you go there... it is named after cheesecake after all!  Worried about not having room for it? Eat it first!",

Sure it's not dirt cheap, nor should it be for such a higher-end casual chain, but at least you're not paying $50 per entree @ Gordon Ramsay, but I digress.  The usual pricing and big portions.  Located at the way back from the Forum Shops, and liked what they did with their patio; it's massive enough to soak in all the eye candy that Vegas has to offer at this time of year.  Don't know possibly how one review said it's quiet in here.",

As we ordered our food I ordered Parmesan herb chicken and it comes with mashed potatoes and green beans I asked for corn succotash instead. We waited about 30 + for our food. Finally food came out my side of corn wasn't ready and server said just a few more minutes ... 10 minutes passed maybe even more nd nothing... finally the manager comes out and says they are all out of the corn succotash and what did I want instead .  At this time I was upset and told him to bring out fries. I didn't even eat the fries I was so upset that a busy resturant runs out of their own food. I waited about 10-15 min for our server to come out and to say they were all out. Then Our server never came back to check on us if we needed refills on our drinks . We finally got our check and I asked the server if I had to pay for the full plate since I didn't get a full plate bcz they were missing the corn and I never touched the fries. He said he would go talk to the manager about that . He offered me a free desert bcz he took for ever in helping us and he didn't check on us. He left and came back left the bill and took off really fast as we checked the bill we noticed that they charged me for the desert and then took it off. I waited for like 5 min and called him over as he was trying to avoid us. I told him to get his manager. He came out and I asked him if he was going to do something about my plate not being complete and his response was oh I already did ure taking the desert and I told him I didn't want the desert . And that the server said. He was giving us the desert bcz he didn't take care of us. And he said okay I didn't charge the corn and I told him he did bcz the plate was 17.50 and that's what I was getting charged. Then he said the corn was extra charge and I said I've never been charged extra for the corn and he said I can get the servers in trouble bcz they not charging right and I told him Ive always ordered this and have never been charged and he said o well ure lucky I dnt charge u. I told him I dnt want the cake the only reason I got it it's because the server said that was free bcz of his timing issue. He finally said he would take 5 buck off the bill. This manager was so not professional fighting w me instead of making a customer happy . I will never visit this place again. This managers name was Liam I think.",

If you're upstairs near the railing, be careful. There's nothing covering the fence part, so if you drop a knife (as I did) you /will/ hit someone. Luckily, it landed between her back and the booth but still. They need to fix that. After the incident, the manager just told me to keep my silverware away from that side to avoid another mishap.   That mishap would never happen again if they fixed that, but still. Always A+ food no matter the location. The staff is super friendly. :)",

    "text": "I've gone to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times in the past, but I've never experienced what I experienced yesterday. After being in the nearby Apple Store for about 3 hours, my friend and I decided to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated fairly quickly, which was great, but our seat was in a super small corner and very close to the the table next to us, so we opted to sit at the bar. This is where the trouble came in.   The bartender first poured us water and took our drink order. When he placed the water down, he slammed the cups in front of us. We thought very little of it initially. Next, he delivered the drinks and walked away without saying anything about food, which we had previously told him we would be ordering. We called him back to order. My friend ordered a pasta dish and asked for extra sauce to be poured in. He replied, \"No.\" We were confused and actually thought he was joking, but he said \"no you can not\" again. She asked why and he explained that many people ask for it and it comes out too soupy and he \"wasn't about to send any food back because it was too soupy.\" Then he called out to someone else (another employee) and walked away. He poured a glass of red wine for another customer then He came back and pointed to me and asked what I wanted to eat, but he hadn't resolved the soupy pasta issue with my friend. We had decided that we didn't like his attitude or the way he yelled out to someone and walked away in the middle of taking our order so we decided that we would enjoy the meal at a different Cheesecake Factory. I told him that we wouldn't be eating here and that we were leaving. He took the receipt for the drinks slid it in front of us and said \"don't forget to pay for these.\" We hadn't had one sip of our drinks. We asked to speak to the manager because we didn't want to walk out and have it look like we skipped out on a bill. The manager was understanding, but not apologetic, and told us that we wouldn't have pay for the drinks that we never touched.   We left, went to the Cheesecake Factory in the district at Green Valley, had a fantastic meal and even greater service.",

Food is reasonably priced, delicious and generous sized portions. In previous orders I've had the mushroom burger, Kobe burger, bbq chicken pizza and some sort of pasta and each dish was delicious. I've never had a bad meal here.  The service was fantastic too! I've tried the vanilla bean cheesecake twice, the carrot cake (not cheesecake) twice and the red velvet cheesecake once. The red velvet was the least favourite of mine but the carrot cake is probably THE best carrot cake I've ever tried anywhere and the vanilla bean cheesecake flavours are to die for, delicious!  The location in Vegas has two floors so plenty of space to get seated even if it is busy.  Wether in Vegas or Orlando the Cheesecake Factory is my go to restaurant when I have a sweet craving!",

    "text": "I recently tackled an ambitious multi-course dinner here, which was both stomach filling and palate pleasing.    For starters, I began with Crispy Fried Cheese, which was composed of a nice mix of both Mozzarella and Fontina Cheeses.  Following close behind were pan-fried Chicken Pot Stickers, which were satisfying doused in a Ginger & Soy Dipping Sauce, and SkinnyLicious Shrimp Summer Rolls that were wrapped in Rice Paper along with asparagus and Shitake Mushrooms.  The cold, fairly wide (not particularly skinny) rolls were lip-smacking good dipped in  either a provided Chili Dip or Peanut Dip.   Next a large cup of spicy Tortilla Soup that would be labeled a \"bowl\" most everywhere else contained a pleasant but unusual concoction of rice- and corn-filled enchilada-flavored liquid.  Complimentary Brown Bread was excellent.  Although by this time more food was hardly necessary, a packed California Cheesesteak that was filled with thinly sliced grilled steak, onions, peppers, and melted cheese, and covered with sauteed mushrooms inside a toasted Ciabatta Roll, was nicely done.  Accompanying French Fries were good, and the Cole Slaw that went with Diane's Fried Shrimp Platter was cool and creamy.  Obviously there was no further room for dessert, so it was forsworn.          Delivery was late on Diane's ordered Root Beer.  Otherwise service was very attentive.  A California casual atmosphere well suited my choice of sandwich.    XXXX-1/2 Overall!",

They were packed for a Sunday, but we were seated quickly. My chicken and avocado club was standard, not a huge fan of the fries, but they were decent. My fella got the catfish, which seemed like an odd choice and he didn't care for it and ended up eating half of my sandwich instead. We also took a pineapple upside down cheesecake, which was really good and had lots of nice big chunks of pineapple in it.  The food was standard and service was as well. Good spot to go when you're inside the Forum Shoppes that won't break the bank.",

    "text": "I had a disastrous family birthday party for my son at this restaurant.  I contacted CF in March to begin setting up for a party in June via phone.  At first they put me through to the banquet manager which was a waste of time-I simply wanted to do a simple breakfast with cake/balloons etc.  my son was turning 4 and we had many out of town relatives staying on the strip that weekend for another celebration.  So we figured that this would be an informal gathering.  Finally the GM of the restaurant got in touch with me and gave me her email to begin putting together a more simple, appropriate, casual celebration for my son.  We emailed back and forth options for a special breakfast menu that they would print out that day-however they didn't have a file with the updated menu and pricing to email me.  After a month back and forth she finally sent photos of the menu for me to pick options.  Two weeks before the event a new manager took over the event.  Sarah seemed to have great ideas for the party.  I was ok with her initially taking over.   The day of the event I showed up and was told that a female waitress would be in charge of the party. I was told to tell her all the things I wanted done for the party.  Well we never saw her again. We were given one male waiter for the entire party. We were never informed that he was taking over the party so I didn't know that I had to tell him all of our plans right then and there in the beginning. They brought out everybody's drinks quickly. Then they went to the other table as we had two tables for a party. That table had only adults and they said to let our table order first as we had small children. So we ordered, however they never went back to the other table. My brother came over that I had to tell him all of our plans right then and there in the beginning. They brought out everybody's drinks quickly. Then they went to the other table as we had two tables for a party. That table had only adults and they said to let our table order first as we had small children. So we ordered, however they never went back to the other table. My brother came over after 30 minutes and asked when we were going to order our food.  I had no idea that they had not ordered. This pushed off of us getting our food for an entire hour. I had over 20 people, some of them out from out of town, many of them toddlers waiting for an entire hour for our food. My son who was the birthday boy started to cry because he was hungry. This became very stressful. Also they only gave us one later for over 20 people. They could've at least given us two waiters, one for each table. The descriptions on the menu did not fully explain what the food came with as a side. A lot of the breakfast items immediately came out with bacon. We had people in our group who are vegan and we had people who are not eating pork for religious reasons and cannot have it touching their food. So all those people had to send their food back and wait even more! By this point I was very frustrated. Going into the birthday cake, they had no idea what kind of a cake we wanted. However I had emailed about this months ago. So they had to go and get the cake ready and they lost the candle that I brought in with my sons age on it. This meant another half an hour waiting for the cake.  The service was the worst service I've ever had in my life! I was so embarrassed in front of my relatives from out of town and I felt terrible for my friends who brought their small children and the kids have been fussing at the table. It was an uncomfortable miserable experience for all of us. I contacted the restaurant via email with all of my complaints direct to the manager that very night. I received an email the next day asking for my address and telling me she was sorry. The service was the worst service I've ever had in my life!

I never heard from them again they never sent anything. After I spent over $300 in their restaurant you would have expected much better quality service. I was so disappointed I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. This was not my first special meal there, I had a baby shower there. I thought that they could handle this but clearly they could not.   I have not been back since and I'm writing 6 months later because I still can't believe how terrible it was and I hope they get their act together.",

I got one with mango on the top and my friend for one with lemon -they were both really delicious :)  The service was on top. Actually the service in the U.S is just better and sweeter than in DK.  The waitress was there smiling all the time, came to ask if we needed anything, if the food was ok, just chatting and wanted to hear a bit about our vacation and DK.

    "text": "I would give this 0 if I could, not just for the food error, but for the extremely poor way that they handled it. I went there after Elton John on 2/21/18 . I had told my friend what a great place this was.   My companion ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and asked for the sauce to be on the side. BBQ sauce can be sweet, smoky, vinegary, thin, thick, hot, like ketchup, like mustard, etc., you just never know.   He ate a couple of bites and said that it tasted funny. It was slathered with BBQ sauce  He is from Brazil and is not used to the usual American way of notifying the staff when something is wrong.  I told the waitress, who was sympathetic but since we did not want to have them recook the burger (it was almost closing time--I do not like to ask a cook to remake something a few minutes before closing time.) she did not adjust the bill and it was brought right out.  Nobody asked if we wanted cheesecake, no refills were offered, just the bill, quickly and not by our waitress but somebody else.  I asked to speak to the manager.  When the manager came, I explained that it just hadn't been a very pleasant night.  He took the bill, and said \"Keep your credit card, I'll take care of this.\" and brought cheesecake menus.  My companion ordered a cheesecake, and they brought the bill, again.  This time there was a free cheesecake, but no accommodation on the burger.  Full price. $15, which is top dollar for a hamburger.    I know that mistakes get made in the kitchen, but don't make a big show of doing something about it when you are not doing anything at all.  Another  friend told me to call  the next day, because perhaps the manager just didn't have a chance to adjust the bill , so I did.  I spoke to a manager named Joe, who listened and said he would get back to me, and of course never did.   I understand you don't want to comp everybody who complains, but the error was clear, the food was made wrong.  I also don't mind paying for what was eaten.  I just don't like paying $15 for a burger that was not made right.  In my business we go by this philosophy:   MISTAKES HAPPEN  When they do:  1 Own it ,  2 Solve it Quickly,  3 Make it More than Right.   Something this Cheesecake Factory did not do.   I brought it to the attention of the waitress,  I brought it to the attention of the manager and I brought it to the attention of another manager the next day.  I did not make a scene in the restaurant, I was as reasonable as I could be.   I can only conclude that they dug in their heels and wanted that $15 real bad.  You saved $15 on a cheeseburger, but you lost this customer for life.",

The chicken breast on the noodles had zero seasoning.  The service was very poor, the waiter didn't ask how our food was, and didn't come around much at all. I had to ask for a refill on my drink when ordering dessert.   The noise is also very loud, I wouldn't recommend coming here for a romantic dinner that's for sure. We sat near the kitchen and it was REALLY loud. They don't have doors that seperate it from the dining area.   The margaritta was 12.00 for a regular size. It was good though.

The garlic herb butter on top of the steak was da bomb! Just exploded with flavor with each bites. The garlic mashed potato is loaded with calories but Who's counting.  Best CF location in my opinion. Manager, waiters/waitresses/hostesses are courteous and acommodating. While waiting for a table, The huge aquarium infront is definitely icing on the cake, no pun intended",

Annoyed that the water is served in a plastic cup, get some glass ones! Free bread, the brown one is amazing!",

Everytime we have gone to Vegas the wait is usally about 20 minutes but with the fish tank outsaide and the laser light show it helps kill time!!!   The food keeps up the great standards of Cheesecake Factory. The staff makes sure your taken care of, the only time you will  really wait is when paying the bill. But I think they do that on purpose the more you wait the more time you have time for your food to digest then you get hungry and get a slice of Cheesecake!! haha",

Then when I asked the waitress for a sazarac, she replied that she had no idea what that was before even consulting with the bar. When she did talk to them, they had o idea what it was either. Come onnnnn, thats America's first cocktail. Standard drink. I'm female and fresh out if college, and even I know what it is. A good bartender would've looked it up on their phone or have had a cocktail book stored at their register. After the huge ordeal, I succumbed to the firefly martini... It had tequila so I was good... For the time being...  My mom had specifically ordered a medium burger. Not only was her burger late coming to the table, it was also a brick. When we told the waitress, she looked so annoyed with us, grabbed the burger plus my mom's fries, without asking. The very insincere manager came over to tell us he took it off the bill, and offered to grab us something else. Anywhere else would've comped the burger and whatever else we ordered for her wait.  My fish and chips were decent...  Not mind blowing.   Extreme oreo cheesecake was far too sweet. Considering all the mishaps and the fact it was my mom's birthday, we would've appreciated a comp'ed cheesecake... But I guess the big bad corporate cheesecake factor is far too big for some good old fashioned service... Or at the very least, a happy birthday.",

I asked how long it would be to seat 4 people and they seated us right away. Our waitress Joey was attentive and didn't mess up our order which is something I have a problem with when it comes to other cheesecake locations. The food was better than other times. I really enjoyed it.",

    "text": "Ahhhh...YES! A restaurant inside a casino that is actually open PAST 11 pm!!    Our group got seriously sidetracked after some gambling and realized that our afternoon of gambling turned into an EVENING of gambling.  We found our way to Caesar's Palace and we were so surprised that almost all the restaurants were closed!!  Thank goodness we found Cheesecake Factory at the very end of the forum shops.  We were seated immediately!  That was good news for my tired feet.  I ordered the bacon, cheese, mushroom and spinach omelet.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best that I've had either.  Service was good all the way up until the end.  We sort of lost our waiter when it came time to pay.  Where did he go?  So we just ended up having to pay cash.  If you don't want to go off the strip to search for a late night dinner spot and you are not craving fast food, Cheesecake Factory inside Caesar's Palace is your best bet!",

They have an menu with around 200 choices.  This is good and bad. This could have been the reason for the confusion with my order. I ordered Parmesan herb crusted chicken but received a different dish. I ended up with a Parisian chicken with spaghetti.  I even told my waiter I thought my order was wrong since I was expecting different sides but he said it was correct that it was came with pasta. I started to eat my entree but asked for a menu. I looked up my entree and I was correct.  Even though I pointed it out to him pointed, he did nothing about it but said sorry for the confusion.  I wasn't in the mood for spaghetti or waiting for another entree to be prepared.  I felt this place was like a fancy dinner that offers too many choices at inflated diner prices. It specializes in cheese cakes but I figured if I ordered one I would end up with pudding. Haha. It's not a bad place to eat but you can find better along the strip.",

We had fried zucchini , blue cheese / pear flat bread, and then chicken wraps with a spicy sauce. This is a great way to nibble without going overboard. We were sat right away and had a great server. I was very happy with our service , our server had a sense of humor and was very outgoing ! We were tempted to have cheesecake , how can you come here and not do it ? So our server was kind enough to split one Strawberry cheesecake in half to serve to us. This was a great experience with great food , hands down.",

Maybe that's cause they were busy. Cloak Anecdote: People looked at me funny when I whipped out my giant DSLR+flash in the middle of the restaurant and started taking pictures of my food. Hey, I'm a photographer. Deal with it.  I fell in love the moment I saw this Cheesecake Factory. It was huge, and glowing with purple...it was majestic.  We had to wait 15 minutes, but that was okay, cause I just went into Express while I waited and then I looked at the fishies swimming around.  I went inside and was greeted by this host who was full of life and really brightened my day as he led me to my table (I was having a bad day up until that point).   The waiter was even better. He was super nice and accomodating. He refilled my drinks before I even realized my drink was gone.  He boxed up our food and everything-something not all CF waiters offer to do.  And is it just me, or does the Coca-cola taste AMAZING?!?!   The food-oh my Caesar (bad pun). I ordered the garlic noodles and they were flour-y bundles of goodness soaked in garlic butter and garnished with large, luscious shrimp. If it wasn't for the fact that I stress-ate myself to oblivion in the previous hour I would've eaten it all and gained 2340398034975304 pounds(and that is not a hyperbole). My sister ordered the salad and loved it. It was seriously the BIGGEST salad I'd ever seen.Two huge mounds of salad adorned with ranch. Impressive.  Would I go here again? The question is, WHEN will I go here again?",

The dimmed lighting and private booths created a nice, cozy atmosphere which made our experience highly enjoyable.   We were presented with toasty garlic bread which we all loved. I tried quite a few entrees. I thought the pasta da vinci, garlic noodles, and chopped salsbury steak were all unimpressive, but the fettuccine Alfredo and Kobe beef burger were both very delicious! The fettuccine's creamy Parmesan sauce was very good, and the burger was a great value at just $12.99. Yum!  For dessert we shared the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae and the glazed strawberry cheesecake. Creamy and dreamy, both were very good!  This restaurant offers quality food and lovely ambiance at a very affordable price. Quite an ideal venue for a romantic date or special dinner with family or friends!   My only gripe was that the silverware was extremely dirty! I could literally wipe white film from my spoon and pick cookie crumbs from my fork... However, our server was nice enough to bring us new utensils AND wipe them down at our table for us, ha.",

We came here because we were meeting friends from Germany, and they don't have any Cheesecake Factories there (sucks to be them!!!) so they wanted to meet up at one here.  Fine by me!!  We met friends here for dinner at 8 on a Sunday night.  There was about a 10 minute wait, if that.  They seated us even though all of our party wasn't there--two of them were on European time.  It gave us plenty of time to enjoy our first round of drinks and to peruse the 87 page menu (only a slight exaggeration).  Our waitress was extremely patient and accomodating considering we were there for over 2 hours.  She was extremely attentive and kept asking us if we needed refills on anything and was great with the suggestions when we were debating about what to get.  My husband got some sort of amazing breakfast burrito that was twice the size of his head.  And he ate every bite of it, too (minus what I stole!)  My friend and I split the tuna carpaccio and the bang bang shrimp.  I also ordered a delicious side salad when their house dressing.  AMAZING.  Overall, it was a great experience, and I would definitely go again!",

Was disappointed at first when we were seated upstairs in a small table right next to the kitchen doors where there was foot traffic galore.  We spotted an open booth and they happily moved us.  Thank gosh because it was probably the most awkward place to sit especially on a first date!  Whatever you are looking for, Cheesecake Factory has it.  I become impressed with menus that have options for a lower calorie meal, although 600 calories doesnt seem that low to me!  I ordered the healthy delight salmon with veggies.  I could have finished the entire thing but didn't want to look like a piglet! It was pretty great!  I was very pleased when in the mixed veggies a little bit of squash and eggplant was mixed in, it wasn't your basic green beans and carrots.  Although, there was green beans and carrots!  But it was all so good!  Service was very kind, prompt, although I had to ask 3 times for a straw and still never received one!   The wait on a Friday night wasn't long, I think we got there at a good time because it was packed!",

    "text": "SWEET!  With all the calories that could be potentially consumed at any TCF location, dining at TCF is a bonafide treat (for me, personally).  My mom and I both love cheesecake, and therefore we couldn't pass up the chance of dining at this location.  LOCATION / SETTING: The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace near the aquarium.  Restaurant is 2 floors, with some seating on the first floor having views of the aquarium and Atlantis Show.    side NOTE:   We actually visited this location twice during our vacation last month.  The first time for take out cheesecake from their counter, and the 2nd for lunch on our last day.  FOOD: The menu is enormous!  So much choices/selections....and that's just the dessert section.  The menu has appetizers, salads, sandwiches, entrees, pastas, etc.  Even for the most finicky of eaters, I'm sure there must be something on this menu that is appealing.  After some time, we decided on the egg roll sampler, while my mom chose the Shepard's Pie, my brother selected the super oxidant salad, and I ordered the BBQ chicken salad (lunch portion).  For drinks, my mom and I ordered coffee, and my brother was all smiles when the server confirmed they could make him a Bloody Mary.  The egg rolls were ok.  They were a bit more oily than I expected, but I shouldn't have been surprised since we ordered fried food for an appetizer.  Not sure if I would order this again.  Thereafter, our entrees were delivered to the table, and I am so happy there were lunch sizes available because my salad seemed (to me) as if it were a FULL SIZE order.  It was massive!  It was just enough for myself, but unfortunately I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  If I were to order this again on a future visit, I would probably ask for no fried onions/onion rings (it just seemed a bit excessive to me).  My brother enjoyed his salad and finished the entire serving.  My mom, on the other hand, found her choice to just be mediocre.  In hindsight, she admitted she should have chosen something else such as a salad or sandwich.    Lastly, the cheesecake (like always) was very satisfying.  We ordered (at the take out counter) one slice each of the key lime and pumpkin seasonal cheesecake.  I felt we needed to order the pumpkin since its a seasonal flavor, and we both concurred that both slices weren't overly sweet.  SERVICE: Very exceptional.  The hostess was friendly and seated us immediately (we arrived at around 1045 am on a Saturday; the restaurant opened at 10am that day).  Our server was a friendly and knowledgeable woman, who answered all our menu questions, and periodically checked on us throughout our meal.    One last thing to mention:  the staff at the take out counter were polite and very efficient.    BOTTOM LINE: Convenient (take a break while shopping!) and spacious location.  Great service.  Delicious desserts!  Yay Cheesecake!",

We got seated at a table where there was food thrown about all over the floor and no one bothered to clean it up. To top it off, our utensils that were supposedly clean and wrapped in a cloth napkin were still caked in food when we unwrapped them. If the utensils aren't clean, then I can only imagine what else isn't here. I've never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory before until this night. We cancelled our meal right away and left.",

Somehow it still took us 20min to decide what we wanted (insert laugh here).  Tucked in the back of Ceasar's Palace, behind the Fall of Atlantis show (giant marble statues of the God's that come to life), the view was great for people watching and the patio, although indoors was much brighter than inside. We both settled on Omelet's. Me, the California, sub all cheeses for goat cheese, and my mom got the Build Your Own. After having walked the strip for six miles we both went with water for hydration. Our waitress was so kind and prompt. Our food was delicious and the portions did not disappoint. The prices are more than your typical Cheesecake Factory, but I guess that's expected in Vegas.",

It is a very busy location but we were pleasantly surprised by how fast and efficient we were seated and served immediately. Our server as well as the host were so polite and genuinely friendly that it made this experience an amazing time for me and my family. There is a wide selection of food options and I am so happy to see that the cheesecake factory is starting to offer some healthier alternatives.   The service here is very fast and the ambience and the decor is beautiful. It can be a little dimly lit and somewhat noisy if you were sitting next to the kitchen but the fact that the service was so quick and professional made up for this. Our food was freshly prepared and served pretty quickly in my opinion. The server was so kind to always update us on the status of our food and when things were taking a little bit longer than they should have. He was very polite and kind and his customer service was outstanding. Everything about this particular location is five star's in quality service and professionalism. Whenever we visit Vegas and are in the mood for the cheesecake factory we will come back to this location with no hesitation. Excellent service overall with high-quality standards and super delicious food and desserts. Highly, highly recommend it for anybody visiting Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Hubby and I were enjoying a date night without the kiddo after a long crazy week and decided we needed to eat at the one and only chain restaurant we absolutely adore - The Cheesecake Factory. It was a Tuesday night around 9:30p and there was a 40 minute wait. Between exploring nearby shops and good conversation the time passed quickly. We were sat at a table near the back on the first floor and our waiter was with us right away. He took awesome care of us all evening - some of the best service I've had at a Cheesecake Factory.   We recently learned how much we love their loaded Nachos. So we ordered them with the \"spicy\" chicken to share. For dessert, we tried to new chocolate coffee cheesecake and also the Godiva brownie sundae (one of our go-tos). The new Cheesecake had great flavor, but not quite the same texture as other cheesecakes.....it felt like it stuck to my mouth in different way. Overall it was good, but next time I think we'll go back to one of our favorites (Oreo or Reese's).    There's so much good food here! I know the menu can be over-whelming. I'm not much for their pizzas and I feel their burgers are just fine. I usually prefer a crazy Appetizer (any of the awesome egg rolls or fried Mac & cheese balls) or a salad if I want something light (Cobb or Greek).",

Got the luau salad for lunch, it was quite different but very tasty. I expected the prices to be crazy, but they were very affordable.   We were so impressed, we came back for dinner. The pasta was so good, Even though I was stuffed, the meal was so good that I couldn't stop eating. My husbands \"medium\" steak came out super rare, but he ate it anyway and said it was good. He didn't get any veggies with his steak, just a bowl of mashed potatoes, with a few onion rings plopped on top. Besides the weird steak dinner, the food was still excellent, as well as the service. Next time we are in Vegas, we will stop here again for sure.",

At this location, we got all of the first and none of the second.  They handle the crowds rather brilliantly - they take your name and tell you what time to come back, and when you return, you're swept directly to a table. It lessens the cattle-chute feeling when you get to just step up, step away, then return to be seated. We had a brilliant, wonderful waiter who nonetheless neglected to warn us we'd ordered too much food, but laughed along with us when we were defeated by the portion size. He was delightful and friendly, like everyone else we spoke to there, despite the weirdness of individuals in crowds (if you have 17 adults and five children, you need to ask for a table for 22, not a table for 17 ya weirdo).  Prices were higher than a non-strip Cheesecake Factory, but not offensively so.",

I was like okay I was about to ask the host. The host said it was fine & guess who was our waitress for the booth? The same rude waitress who told us we couldn't sit there meaning that it was most likely a part of her section. In my experience as a waitress, if my guests wanted to move to another table in my section they would be more then welcome to & not scolded. The worst part of our experience was we ordered our food and didn't get it until about an hour later. After the wait, you would think the food would be prepared well but both of our pasta dishes were dry. We had our waitress bring it back & the manager Aaron brought it to us & apologized. This occurred after the screw up which took up to an hour plus of our time. After arriving at 10pm & not getting our food till 11:10pm we were tired & just wanted to leave because we literally were one of the last tables before close. Our food was packed with no silverware as well. It's sad because it was our first night in town & we were hoping to be about but this cancelled our plans. Because of this experience, we won't be back at this location.",

I have heard about the restaurant very in depth through a class I am taking at UNLV and had to experience it first hand.  For starters the atmosphere of this restaurant is very appealing! A nice calm lighting with a warm and welcoming feeling.  If this is your first time, I recommend ordering an appetizer right away as it will take a good minute to look through the menu. This place has everything you can imagine and it all tastes amazing!   The food is mouth watering to say the least. The chefs in the back truly know what they are doing and really put their love and passion for cooking into the food. The waiters are also very pleasant and helpful. The prices for this location are very reasonable, especially considering its location along with the quality of the food.   If you haven't tried this restaurant and are considering it, do it! You will not regret that decision and everyone in your group will find something they like with the endless options in the menu.",

That said I would be remiss if I did not send a digital fist-bump to our waiter Jeff who was phenomenal.  I'm sure that we aren't the first obnoxious drunk people who've stumbled in here for late night grub but I doubt it ever gets easy to deal with and nobody does that better than Jeff.  He was a great sport, jumping in on our inside jokes, and provided top notch service.  There's certainly more prolific places to eat in Las Vegas, but you can do worse than the Caesar's Palace Cheesecake Factory.",

I had a birthday here when I was a teenager, 7 out of 25 of us got food poisoning, and never looked back until now. Almost a decade has passed and a part of me cringed when my friend suggested going here. I wanted to go to the other place known for their desserts in the Forums, but she is allergic to chocolate.   Between three of us, we split the Buffalo Chicken Blasts, Skinnylicious Spicy Chicken Salad, and the Everything Pizza with kalamata olives and jalapenos. Overall, the food was decent. It is nothing spectacular. In fact, the only thing that is impressive about it is the sheer amount they give you. We could have probably stuck with two items and splitting between three.",

She was quite attentive to us.  However, the bread she initially brought us was burned and really hard. Then, more bread came but it was cold. The better Cheesecake Factory restaurants normally toast the bread on the spot so that when the customer eats it, it is warm and soft, not cold and burned.  I ordered from the special menu (the separate insert) where they have the chef's specialty items for that particular restaurant. I ordered the salmon with spinach and angel hair pasta. The salmon was excellent. However, their sauce was extremely creamy and oily. It was very overwhelming. If the sauce was replaced with let's say marinara sauce, it would have been perfect. So, I ended up eating all the spinach and salmon only and left the sauce and angel hair pasta alone.",

They could really benefit from some sort of paging system. It would be nice to be able to look at shops and while you are waiting for the unpredictable time. Once we got in it took a bit to get waited on but they were clearly understaffed. Still would recommend as their food is so consistently good with generous portions great for sharing.",

I came right as it opened and there was already a line forming to get inside. The seated everyone pretty quick though and had more than enough staff to accommodate everyone. I ordered the calamari and it was good. Ive had it before so I knew what to expect. My server was excellent. She was attentive the whole time and I always had what I needed. I was looking forward to enjoying their s'mores galore cheesecake but was very disappointed that they ran out. I wold think that at the beginning of the day they would have all flavors available so that was annoying. I opted for the white chocolate raspberry and I was not impressed. I expected to be better than it was so that was a bust. I did not spend a lot of time there. I just kind of got in and got out kind of thing so there is nothing else to really review. It was a pretty basic visit. Honestly I highly doubt that I would go back because there are better places to eat in Vegas that I don't have access to at home.",

I ordered a fettuccine alfredo and it was just overall nothing special. I tried to eat as much as I could because it was the last meal before heading to the airport to go back home, and I'd get hungry if I didn't eat.  But anyway, I felt like I could've probably whipped up a better fettuccine alreado at home if I tried. On the other hand, I did like my boyfriend's pasta dish a lot more.   We didn't get a cheesecake, since we were already full. (Well, I forced myself to eat as much as I could. haha) Hopefully, I'll be more impressed with another dish or just different location of the Cheesecake Factory.",

That was my initial impression on  Tuesday evening at this location.  The hostess was kind but wasn't overly anxious to seat us.  No eagerness to see how our day had been going or how they may accommodate us past how many in our party...(felt like we were caught up in some mechanism we couldn't break out of once the service started up!)    First the water attendant to ask if we cared for water....Then the waiter to hit us up for our booze fix question, then the bread person (alternate bus-boy), to bring us our serving of yeasty fix-ins....Followed by the timed \"Do you know what you may want for dinner?...Might I start you off with an appetizer?\"  from our waiter again....It all felt so routine an impersonal.  No eye contact, no \"how is your day going?\", No smile!  We did get---\"Shall I give you a few more minutes?\" and without us answering, our waiter was able to read our minds and turned and walked away to another table because we had wavered a slight bit in our timing to respond!-----SO IMPERSONAL!  So Ho-Humm!  If I had stabbed myself with a fork, they probably would have asked if I would like another fork?  How's about we talk about the food!  Good for I had the Hungarian Goulash, and my friend had the CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA.  Both were done right and served in a timely fashion.  And my friend's Birthday!?---Not even a mention of a birthday cupcake or anything (Quite disappointing that they offered nothing when most other places offer at least a scoop of ice creme!)...they didn't even offer though I had told them.  My over-all assessment here is ---- they need to get a clue that being at the Caesars Palace Colonnade Mall, The Cheesecake Factory is like an ambassador to the world, and they came close to getting a failing grade here tonight!",

Our waitress didn't greet us and looked annoyed and we later found out she was and it was with the bus boy. Towards the end it got better but for the most part a little ghetto as far as attitude.

Very impressed :) Service was great...unfortunately, I decided to try something different than my usual Chinese chicken salad & fried macaroni and cheese balls. Slightly disappointed. I definitely don't recommend their cream of chicken soup. Just a lil too watery and too many tomatoes floating around for my liking.   BUT, the vanilla bean cheesecake was ah-mazing. Their slices are gigantic so we had it split and the waitress was even nice enough to bring it on two separate plates (*kudos* to good service*).   So I think I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a million times (ok maybe not but...) and I've [so far] concluded the following:  Yay: Chinese Chicken Salad, Fried Macaroni Balls, Meat Loaf, Pot Stickers, Club Sandwich, Terriyaki Steak, Pomegranate Margarita, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  Nay: Cream of Chicken Soup.",

We were really happy off of mai tais and margaritas they let us bring into the restaurant.  WIN!  We tagged 2 waiters and the second one brushed us off with, \"Oh, they'll be with you soon.\"  FAIL!  The manager found us and genuinely and thoroughly apologized, and offered to comp our desserts.  MEGAWIN!  We were assigned the second waiter that gave us the bullshit answer.  PWNAGE!  Ordered buffalo wings which were a perfect match of spicy and sour, and spinach+artichoke dip that came with chips instead of bread as usual.  WIN!  The 5 desserts we tried: - Peanut Butter Cheesecake: Very very heavy.  Tastes like sugared up peanut butter and not for the weak of heart. - Carrot Cake: Very classic, hard to go wrong but not spectacular.  Desserts are obviously overpriced at TCF but they don't skimp you.  Calorie for calorie you get what you pay for and the cakes are all a couple inches taller than the cheesecakes. - Oreo Cheesecake: Not bad, hard to go wrong. - Red Velvet Cheesecake: OMG sooooo good.  This was an unexpected combination for me.  The only thing I can think of is that the amount of cream cheese frosting can be overwhelming but other than that it's a really yummy dessert. - Bowl of Fresh Strawberries: For $6.50 you get 10-15 strawberries.  Scam!  But for free it was a good combo with each of the cheesecakes.  If you have money to blow I would highly recommend getting this with any cheesecake order.",

The majority of their menu is outstanding to choose from however it matters most of what you are in the mood for or ask the server to give you the best ideal selections. The customer service is stellar as well as the prices (not too steep). For the service and the food quality this place usually tops/ does better than the other 5 star rating restaurants within the Vegas strip and you wont over spend your money. The location is inside the Caesar's palace mall (forum shops) nearby the aquarium. Again they usually do a great job getting you situated upon arrival however I usually visit them during the middle of the week.",

While on our vacation, our group of friends had come up with a scavenger hunt of sorts where we were supposed to do certain dares. One of these dares was to eat food off of the plate of someone you did not know. Enter: the Cheesecake Factory. One of my friends decided to take this dare on and noticed a family getting up from their meal (children included). They had left some plates of half-eaten cheesecake on their table and she saw this as her opportunity.  Before the family had even left, she walked up, picked up a fork and took a big bite of their cheesecake, smiled and walked back to our table. The looks on their faces were victory enough.  I'm pretty sure the rest of our meal involved specialty drinks from their bar so I can't accurately comment on the food, or really anything else that happened. ;)",

Quality, Presentation and Tasteful made the best of it.. We also had a little mix with rice preference but the server quickly made a correction.. That's what you call quality service..",

If you like one where ever you are, then you'll like this one.    SERVICE:   The wait is long if you go around dinner time.  We waited, gambled, and drank to get a buzz and went later than 9:00 p.m.   So, we got seated fairly quickly.  The service...nothing special...it's what you'd expect at any Cheesecake Factory restaurant.    FOOD QUALITY:   The food was okay.  It was, as I said earlier, like any other Cheesecake Factory on the planet.    WOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?:  Probably not.",

And the service was fast and the bartender was very pleasant and attentive. I work in a fine dinning restaurant with great food, but this one appetizer dish I tried along with the lunch portion Chinese Chicken salad was to die for! The Avocado egg rolls were delicious!!!!!! They have sun dried tomato and plenty avocado in them, and to go along with it, is the sweet cilantro dipping sauce. So far I've gone there 3 times in the last month in a half. This is a must try, if you don't eat meat and love avocados. Of course they have a long list of different cheesecakes, I always stick to strawberry cheesecake. Yum!",

My favourite restaurant when i visit the U.S.   Serves the best food and desserts. You cant go wrong with anything on the menu. Theres so much choice. You could eat there every single day for 2 weeks and have something different everytime. I love the Club sandwich and Lindas Fudge Cake or any of the Cheesecakes for dessert. Like pretty much most places in America the portions are HUGE and the place is super clean!   Its always busy and theres quite a wait for a table but thats understandable as that shows what a great place it is. Its definetly worth the wait! Nowhere else can compete with the Cheesecake Factory in my opinion.   I highly recommend eating here. Unfortunatly 5 stars is the highest you can give, because this place easily gets 10 stars ! :)",

But who really goes to a place called The Cheesecake Factory for their entrees?  They really do know how to make a good cheesecake, although you'll probably only need about half a slice.  Their filling is thick while still remaining creamy and full of flavor and the selection is astounding (the tiramisu cheesecake is my personal favorite).  I'm a huge cheesecake fan and I can dig theirs.  I still think my homemade ones are better, but you can't win them all.    You can't beat this location though.  Sitting on the balcony and looking at the aquarium at the Forum Shops?  That pretty much wins.",

Our server, Gabby, was so great.  The strawberry lemonade is like a drug, that's how delicious it is.  Fresh-made guacomole and warm chips!  Super lunch specials.  I wish I was there now.

You even get some romantic mood lighting and action brought to you in part by the \"Neptune, King of the Ocean\" Show playing sporadically throughout  your meal.  We got a kick out of this.

I was bummed but what ever I didn't have time to get anything else, I was about to start eating when I noticed a piece of plastic in it, looked like a piece of tape, but at least a inch long   I called and asked to speak to a manager, she said to bring it back so they can see it and they'll start a new one right away and throw in a piece of cheesecake.  I get there the to go lady was nice, she says they are making a new one now.... I wait prob 10 mins get back to my store and open it. No tape but seriously gave me the same container of food back. So cool I got back a tiny portion of the food that had a piece of tape in it that someone stuck there fingers in to take out. Not cool.",

The multiple levels is a architectural design element not seen in other restaurants, but is necessary because they get so much traffic.

Having to wait to get in and the long journey it takes to get to this location from the casino, are the only two drawbacks. Everything else, including the staff and food have always been good.  It is near a large aquarium and an animatronic show with fire and water, so those help to pass the time.

Her amazing job is enough to make me consider going back the next time I am in town & for me to give their location a 5 star Yelp rating.  Their portion sizes are incredible. I ordered the fish taco's, which easily could have fed two people. My husband & I both left with to-go boxes. The food was delicious & the drinks were great.

    "text": "We met a few friends in Vegas, and thought it would be nice to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  We hoped that it would be consistent with the quality we have come to enjoy like the one in Waikiki on Oahu.  We were not disappointed.  We started with a few appetizers, the crab artichoke dip is the best!  My wife had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (with a Thai Curry flair) and I had the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo.  Both were outstanding, and highly recommended!  The hostess was very courteous, and our waitress was extremely attentive.  The only disappointment was not having time to stay for dessert!  We had to leave en route to a 7 p.m. show of the Jersey Boys playing at the Paris Hotel!  That was also a 5 star experience!",

    "text": "Can't ever really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. The portions are huge, food is pretty good, decent price for a restaurant, and the cheesecakes are amazing. Went here for a date night with my boyfriend one night. I never realized how huge this Cheesecake Factory is! Didn't expect it to be as big as it was. It's a little too dimly lit, in my opinion. We were seated near the kitchen area and given free bread. It was extremely cold in here...I wish I had brought a jacket. We knew the portions here are huge, so decided to share an appetizer of crispy crab wontons and one entree of the alfredo fettuccine with mushrooms and chicken. The crab wontons came out quickly. They were extremely hot and we burned our tongues on them. ): They tasted great though! The pasta came out soon after. The pasta was heavy and filled us up quickly. Even though we were sharing all of this, we almost didn't order dessert. ALMOST. How can you go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake?! We ended up ordering a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. It was delicious. Lots of gooey cookie dough pieces in the middle. We were only able to finish half of it because we were so full. The total was about $50, which isn't too bad for how full we were. This is probably one of the cheapest restaurants to eat at on the Strip.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas with my mom and sister for a girls weekend.  This was our last dinner in town.  I had never been to a CF in my life.  It was a Saturday night and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our table.  Once seated, they presented us with menus that could feed an army one at a time.  I believe it was quoted to me at 30+ pages!  Our server, Steven B. made the experience phenomenal.  He's adorable, very humorous and ON IT!  By on it I mean he anticipated our every whim all the while still finding time to give other tables around good service.  He kept coming by on his way from another table to crack a joke or two.  I have never felt so welcomed at a large restaurant before.  The personalized service would have prompted me to review this place even if the food was mediocre.  Except the food wasn't mediocre.  I ordered a taco salad from the Skinnylicious menu and was shocked at the enormous size AND it was delicious.  I also sampled the Ahi appetizer which was delectable.  My mom ordered a to die for pear martini.  Thank you CF for making things such a great experience and a special thanks to Steven B. for being the ULTIMATE in service staff.  You are my hero!",

    "text": "My husband  and I came here on our first date, some years ago, but we went to the Summerlin location where there was an hour long wait, and ended up here. I got a salad and he got the thai noodle dish. We decided to go here again for date night during the week (now that he works days we can do things during the week, which is nice). We were able to get a table upstairs right away. Weekends are crazy busy-waits can be less painful by gazing at the very impressive aquarium featuring many different kinds of fish and some rays. This is a popular place among tourists so be prepared to wait.   The service is very good (refilled drinks). We were presented with a bread basket (sourdough & honey oat) within minutes of being seated. Our drinks came right away. I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo (came with chunks of sausage and a large scoop of rice in the middle) while my husband ordered the shepherd's pie. The menu is about 19 pages long including 34 varieties of cheesecake! It was almost hard to choose something since there are so many choices. Most of the dishes are served on huge white plates (more like platters). It didn't seem too long for our dinners to arrive. The presentation was nice- parsley generously sprinkled around the entire perimeter of my plate. My husband thought that my dinner was small, but I only ate half of it, and took the rest home (as did he). The gumbo was good, but not traditional, in that the broth was clear, and secondly, there were big chunks of tomatoes. I thought that this is worth mentioning since I am a big fan of the traditional style gumbo with the roux (oyster bar at stations). The dish My husband's dinner was good and large (compared to mine), but I am not really a fan of this dish.   For both our dinners, one drink, one water, it was about $35 plus tip. The ambiance (there is patio seating available), the service, the food, the wide variety of menu items, including cheesecake, the complimentary bread basket, and the location make this chain restaurant very attractive. (As busy as this one is, the one in Oahu seems to be the busiest CF location ever. This is the original location in Las Vegas; two others in Summerlin and Green Valley.) Also worth mentioning, the free show,  and the shopping is great- from the Gap, Bath & Body Works, the always-packed Apple store, and Victoria's Secret in the original part of the Forum Shops. Newly expanded stores include: Swatch, Tommy Bahama, Harry Winston, and Anthropologie. It might be confusing to some people how the different levels are, but just ask someone to point you in the right direction.",

    "text": "It started out really bad.  After checking in with the hostess, we're told about 10 mins wait and was asked to wait behind the counter.  Twenty-five minutes had passed and as we look around everyone that was waiting before us, including those that came after us, were seated except our party. It was then I've decided to come up to the counter where the manager Ahmad where standing and waited patiently for my turn to speak to him (he was talking to the hostess). He never even bothered to ask if I needed anything... he knew I was there and yet he continued to ignore me while he acknowledged this woman who just walked up to him. So, I finally asked  how much longer do we need to wait before we get seated.  Much to our surprise, they couldn't find our ticket.  My wife and I were furious at that point.  Glad we had Alicia as our server.  She asked how our day was and we told her what just happened.  Apparently, she told another manager,Greg, what happened. Greg approached us immediately, he listened and was very apologetic, and offered us an appetizer.  We politely declined but expressed that we were grateful he came and spoke with us.  Overall, what started as a bad experience turned to a very positive one..... Kudos to Alicia who was very attentive and gave us 5 star service.",

The menu is like a phone book, like all Cheesecake Factories, but that never intimidates me. The atmosphere is very nice and laid back, which is refreshing. The place is actually located at the very end of the Forum Shops, so it's the furthest distance from the casino floor, which is good all around. The service is great. I've never gone there with a party of less than 8 people, and my water glass has never been empty for more than a couple of minutes. The food is very good, and its presentation is terrific. But, the real surprise is the price. Very reasonable for any Strip restaurant, let alone one that's inside a big name casino.  I only wish that they had a back door so that I wouldn't have to walk through the casino.",

When it comes to eating, everyone from outside the United States would love to get served by Penny from the Big Bang Theory, which bought me to this little establishment about 4 years ago & keep returning annually when I revisit the States.   Situated in the Caesars Palace forum mall, the Cheesecake Factory is located right at the end of the mall, right next to the huge fish tank. I somehow always end up with seating outside looking at the fish tank, which is fine by me as it is an alright view.   The service can be a little slow at times, but generally is pretty good. The quality of the food is great, and overwhelmingly large, however you come to expect that here. Just make sure that you leave a little room for dessert.   PS. The chicken Bellagio is probably better here than anywhere else in the country - as freaky as that sounds, it is True...",

You know its a holiday be prepared. Two of our fav. Items the cheeseburger egg rolls and the buffalo blasts were completely out, wouldnt you order extra of everything knowing this is Valentines day and also Las Vegas. Ordered our sons corndogs as soon as we sat down since he was fussy and we ordered the rest of our food 15 min later. All of our food came out before his three lil corndogs from the kids menu. The Manager Brandon did come over and apologize twice an apologized for the lateness but he stated that we make everything fresh. We had six in our party plus our son where all the other food that was ordered later came out.. Dont give people excuses just be honest and straight forward with what happened. I have been coming to the cheesecake for years and have never had an experience like this one. Way below expectations and the standard I know they have.  Wont be returning to this location if I do return to a cheesecake factory. I am a local to las vegas and was taking relatives from out of town to eat i guarantee that will not happen again at this location and potentially any cheesecake factory..",

So we arrived at 730ish and the wait was 35 plus minutes for 7 people. Our server Shawn M and he was no doubt one of the best server we've had in a long time. Shawn got us drinks and took our appetizer order which was very fast. After we ate our apps  we order dinner and waited waited waited waited for bread to come. Finally it arrived. Soon after our dinner came. It came in stages we got two entrees first and two minutes later got another two entrees and another two minutes later we got the other two. So six minutes total to get 6 out of 7 entrees. Well after 13 minutes later we finally got our last entree and the manager brought it to our table and tried to make a joke about what happened verses apologizing. So bottom line 4 or more guest watch out.... Service AAAA+, Kitchen they no doubt have issues. Regardless how busy you are you have to be on point....We will not be back anytime soon. So if you have a special occasion and have 4 or more guest go somewhere else!",

Why does someone have to relay him a message when I said it several times? No one else asked. Their waiters knew. I didn't ask. I told him he had 1 flaw. Not hearing me mention it 3 times. He had some excuse on why he didn't do it. Several excuses. Because he didn't want to ruin the surprise. Well...it's not a surprise if I'm telling you, but good excuse though.

Though it's location at the very end of the Forum Shops at Caesar's is a bit inconvenient, the longest I've had to wait for a seat was 40 minutes even during busier seasons (once for a party of 11 and once for a party of 4).  Both times I've eaten here, the service was impeccable, and of course the portions are huge, the food tasty, and all well worth the price. My friend swears by the Chicken Madeira, though I never order it because I don't eat mushrooms. The mac-and-cheese burger is delicious, as is the chicken burrito (though I would have preferred it to have shredded chicken rather than cubed). I also really enjoy the Flying Gorilla alcoholic milkshake.  I don't eat here EVERY time I go to Vegas, but it's definitely a good option, and probably one of the better ones in regards to price - especially in the Forum Shops. Again, I can't stress enough that both times I ate here the service was great (in a town where I usually find the service to be average at best).",

It was Happy National Cheesecake Day on July 30 & July 31st, 2014 so I went over to a Cheesecake Factory (not this branch) to have a slice of cheesecake at 1/2 price!!  Anyways the following is my review for this location written back in February 2014:  I must confess that I am a diehard Cheesecake Factory fan!  Unless the service is very bad, I will not give them less than 4 stars.  This specific location inside Caesars Palace holds a special place in my heart, but I will not go into specifics.  Suffice it to say that I love this place!  Normally, I get here before it gets too crowded.  Sometimes I will have to wait, but it is worth the wait.  Will just wait and people watch or browse around some of the Forum shops til it is our turn.  The menu reads like a small book.  It can get confusing at times cause everything sounds so good.  Every appetizer and entree that I have had has not disappointed.  All are above average, and the portions are huge so come hungry.    Of course, a meal here is not complete without dessert.  I will always save room for a slice of cheesecake.  If it means that I cannot finish my entree, then I will just take home the leftovers and enjoy it the next day.  I have tried over a dozen of their cheesecake flavors.  My current favorites are Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake, and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake.  I only have one complaint.  Stop discontinuing my favotite sandwiches.  They used to make a three cheese Grilled Cheese sandwich which was awesome.  They also used to make a Monterey Cheeseburger which was the bomb.  I truly miss those two items.    With that being said, every time we return to Caesars Palace, going to this Cheesecake Factory is a must.  Many good memories here.",

Can you imagine sitting thought out lunch listening to a constant buzzing noise?   Well I couldn't take it and it made my lunch very unpleasant.  So I brought it to the attention of the staff.   The first manager just closed the door to stop the buzzing.  But then it opened and started again.  So I talked to a second manager which she did nothing about.  I asked the wait help to call a manager for the third time which no one came.   Finally I had to ask them to put a sign so no one would attempt to use the elevator.  Why should it take 4 times for a simple issue to be resolved.  Very poor customer service on the management side of the place.  Hope they read this and try to improve themselves",

It's very crowded, quite loud, and if you are lucky enough to get a patio seat you will be treated to the Poseidon show complete with smoke, water and flames.   My husband went with a chicken pasta dish, and I opted for the chicken tostada salad.  Both were good as usual.  The service was excellent, as it should be in a big hospitality based town.     Is it flash, fancy or different-no, but if you are looking for a quick meal without breaking the bank, then here's your place.",

Too tired to find a cheap place to eat (which was hard in the Forum Shops) but not wanting to spend a crazy amount of money for lunch, we found the Cheesecake Factory! I know... we can find this restaurant back at home... but we were really hungry and the Factory never really had failed us in the past.  We were seated right away, and we sobered up quickly with their complimentary bread, lol. We decided to eat light (as we planned to eat greasy pizza later that night) so we ordered calamari and the luau salad, which were both very good and served in big portions. We ended the lunch with a macadamia nut cheesecake, in celebration for my late birthday with my girlfriends!  Overall, it was a good experience with good food and good friends. We're glad to have found this restaurant while super drunk. Thanks!",

After waiting for our beverages and sending back the cutlery that had old food on them, our dinner arrived.  As we considered another glass of wine or dessert the intolerable noise of the show started again. We instantly made our wine or dessert choice and stood to leave.

I understand it's Christmas Day but he just didn't want to be at work and we were a party of eight and we all noticed it.  It took 45 minutes for us to get our food. We ordered three filet minion steaks, and one burger . One nachos ..  all the meat was burned crisp, we send the steaks back and they told us it would be another 25 minutes, so that was not cool . Our waiter told us it's because it's on a char grill .. please we eat at the Cheesecake Factory often and we all eat steak often .. our 21 year old eat hers because she was starving but it was tough. The food  unacceptable.  All other food was decent .   So I would not waste your time at this location . Spend your time elsewhere.",

Wait was 40 minutes so we went next store to the awesome gift shop. After we were sat we ordered waters and a beer for me and a cocktail for my friend. The prices are not on the menu. We ordered our meals. Bang bang chicken and pasta de Vinci. We also ordered each a side salad. The bang bang chicken wasn't at all what I expected. Tasted like ramen. Couldn't get it out of my head. Lol guess I shouldn't have experimented with something new I've never gotten.   My friend got the pasta which tasted like butter pasta. They forgot the Madeira sauce or something because it had no flavor at all! I've had it before and it was seriously missing something.... we didn't tell our server because we just figured maybe that's how it should've been... idk we were very confused. Ended up throwing it out when we got home.   My beer was a blue moon. Couldn't drink it. It was super yeasty and tasted like the end of the keg. Also the cosmopolitan my friend got was yummy. But was 14$. In the end our meal was over priced for the poor taste of our food. Definitely won't be getting these menu items again. Also I'll never ever buy alcohol from cheesecake again....",

What's funny is that Cheesecake is usually managed properly enough to avoid these rookie mistakes but it was either a blunder tonight or the company decided to go down hill.  With our food nowhere in sight, we ended up walking out but I did at least tell the managers our plight and they seemed genuinely concerned.  However, my party was already past the outside aquarium so we just decided to continue.    I worked in restaurants where executives decide to boost profits by cutting labor necessary to make customers happy.  If that's the case here, there are thousands of other places we will be happy to go instead.",

I was satisfied with the value for the money for the dish I ordered.   The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go if you know what dishes you like.

We were a group of 8 people with one person on a scooter becuase they had a broken foot. We walked up and they took down our name and the wait wasnt to bad. At most we waited about 5 minutes, which in our eyes is very duable. Here is where it goes down south.  Once we were seated no one ever came to us to greet us or take out order. We sat there annoyed, hungry, and sleepy for about 15 minutes before someone even came. Then when he did come, he took our drink orders and some appitizer orders and took about another 10 minutes to come back with our drinks. Mind you 6 out of 8 people ordered water the other two coke. You can not tell me that it takes 10 minutes to get some water from the tap!  When the waiter finally did return with our drinks he took our order. At this point half the group took their meal togo because we were tired of sitting there playing the waiting game. It took us about 45 minutes to get our food. Which took entirely to long. We saw families sit down after us by like 30 minutes and get their food before us. While we waited, we never got any bread like the rest of the tables. We asked for some, but never reccieved any. Along with that, we had one person ask about the oil they use because of food allergys. The waiter said that he would check and get back to us and he never did. So one person in our group didnt even order anything becuase he failed to get back to us with important health related information.   Once the food did come, we were ready to go. Some meals ended up being nice and hot while others cold and undercooked. My sister ordered shrimp alfredo and her shrimp were were raw and cold. She ate one shrimp because it looked off and no long be hold it was raw and cold. She immedietly sent her plate back, when she did the waiter caught a bad attitude with her with was not neccessary at all. We waited for our checks, paid and then left.  We were sitting there for roughly 2.5 hours for us not to even eat our food at the resturant. This is the most unprofessional resturant that I have been to, along with that having rude and unknowledgeable staff.  I DO NOT RECCOMEND this to anyone. While some had a good experiance, we did not. If you want to go out to eat, go somewhere else, but this is not the place togo.   I included a picture of two of the meals before they were boxed up and taken home.",

This guy deserves a raise or at least a bonus for his thoughtfulness and recognition for going above and beyond. Please recognize this individual. I wish I would've got his name, but he was working Friday evening the 16th of Nov around 4:45 PM. Our server was great as well.  Now, to the bad. First, I'm disappointed in the quality and overall price of the kids menus and food. We got them the macaroni and cheese, and one grilled chicken. The macaroni was very basic and had little cheese on it. My kids usually gobble down macaroni and cheese, but they didn't like this one at all. After tasting it myself, I was extremely disappointed. The chicken was super dry without any flavor. Moving onto our entrees, my salads had lettuce and tomatoes that were borderline unacceptable. The freshness definitely was not there. My wife's entree was good.   I wouldn't mind so much for the children's meals if the cost wasn't so high. But I can get extremely better quality kids meals at half the price at lesser quality restaurants.  As always, the cheesecake was amazing, and what we will continue to go back for.",

But something's gone terribly wrong.  How wrong?  On two out of my last three visits, I never even received my food at all. The orders have just been lost.  I've pretty much narrowed the problem down to a single server at the counter, and unfortunately i haven't been able to figure out the times when she's NOT working. Until she retires or moves on, I'm done with this particular Cheesecake Factory.  The food here is great. If you can avoid this particular counter server, you'll have a 4-5 star experience. Avoiding the counter means waiting in line though, and that's a dealbreaker for me.",

    "text": "This place is inside Cesar's Palace which is cool it has a large salt water fish tank just outside with a show every hour.   The restaurant is usually crowded. We didn't have much room at our table. We had a group of five.  The food is good as always. With a few exceptions. I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo which is delicious and my go to favorite. The shrimp was way over cooked and rubbery unfortunately, but came in a really great portion size. Also the bread was a little overdone/crispy.  My wives steak tacos were delicious but they came after everyone was already done eating. Like 15-20 minutes after everyone else's food came out. They did give her a free cheesecake for the trouble though...  The waiters were really apologetic and accommodating though.  So this place is average compared to other Cheesecake Factories but it's cool to go see the show outside if you plan on it beforehand!",

The server was friendly and service was pretty fast for a Friday night.  I got the Chicken Madeira,  which comes with mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, and asparagus. It was yummy, the chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce was good. My bf got the Chicken Fettuccini and loved it. For dessert, we got the Oreo Cheesecake and we left full and satisfied.   TIP: Ask for their wheat bread. So good!",

I got a blended peach drink with a raspberry swirl (I can't remember the name) which was delicious. The bread was good- white and honey oat I believe. They were hard, but I think maybe that's how they're supposed to be?   I ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo and it was really good. I ordered the supper portion instead of the lunch portion- huge mistake. It was SO much pasta; I don't know if I even ate half of it.   My mom got an omelette with breakfast potatoes that she said was good. I tried the potatoes and they were nice and crispy. My dad ordered the everything pizza and it looked so good (he said it was good and filling). I'm for real considering going back before we leave Vegas just so I can order and try the pizza.",

However, the Cheese Cake factory in the Forum shop is actually a gem on the strip, providing if you are not looking for a fine dining experience.  Price overall was very reasonable for a sitdown restaurant in Vegas.  Speed was efficient.  Service was considerably good.  Friendly & helpful staff.   Of the 7 days stay at Caesar for a conference, we had tried their paste, salmon special, some burger and fries, fish and chips, flat-bread  appetizer & pot sticker.    Ax the board, their food quality were consistent and were above and beyond other restaurants of the same franchise.  In fact, we liked their salmon lunch special (miso, simply grilled) so much that we went there almost every day we stayed there.   I am giving a 4 star for their location, and for $ value with respect to their overall food quality and services.  Would recommend for families and individuals on budget / biz trip.",

We waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated, now there was only two of us but still it was nice not having to wait that long. Once we got our seats our waiter  came over and right away suggested some drinks since we were looking at the adult beverages (of course, hello we're in Vegas!) he told us the new blood orange margarita was great so we both went with that. SO good!!! I wish I would've gotten my waiters name because he was awesome! I ordered the combo of the steak Diana with salmon and it was delicious. The salmon didn't have the least bit of that fishy taste that most salmon has, the steak was perfect and the mashed potatoes were great too! Of course we got cheesecake as well, I got the s'mores and my friend got red velvet. One great thing after another with this place! I will say that when you're going to a Cheesecake Factory make sure you at least have an idea of what you'd like to eat because they have a huge selection on their menu so I don't think you wanna take the time and read each item with description on there.",

I had gone twice previously and hadn't been overly impressed.  It seemed a little overpriced and the food just seemed to be slightly above average.  But we went this past weekend with some family and it was AMAZING.  I tried something that I normally would never get, which was the Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta, and it was incredible.  For an appetizer my wife and I shared the Avocado Egg Rolls, and they too were very good.  To drink I had a Typhoon Punch, which was really tasty.  My wife got the 4 cheese pasta, and she loved it.  My only regret was I didn't save room for dessert.  Next time I will!  Overall I'm not sure it's entirely worth what we paid (final total came out to $65, which was for 2 pasta orders, 1 appetizer, and my alcoholic drink), but I think we paid a little bit more than most Cheesecake Factory locations due to its location inside Caesar's Palace.

It's like the family that when you see it you're really happy to see them, especially when they're less than $50 ;)   So if you're a homebody like me and can't afford to live the Vegas lifestyle of seafood and overpriced steak then head to where the home is, Cheesecake Factory.  Enjoy.",

I am a big fan of there happy hour menu and drinks, very delicious. However if I have to choose my favorite by far... Has got to be the Luau Salad! So delicious!!! Nutty, sesame goodness with a thick layer of crispy wonton sheet and chicken breast. They have it in there lunch special menu as well :)",

Our table was a booth and they stuck a chair at the end of it and it was located next to the silverwear, so every waiter/busboy who came by every 15 seconds to rattle silverwear...ugh...noisy and bothersome!  We should have left.  I ordered a boring plain chopped salad that was tasteless.  Kids had grilled cheese and pasta, so thank goodness I was able to take bites out of their decent food.

It also g wet s very dark outside, as they turn off the lights for the show.  The decor of the place is very classy. High ceilings with hanging fixtures. The place is very dim inside so it does have a classy - romantic feel to it.   The menu features a full course dining option from appetizers  to desserts.   They serve a complimentary french and honey oat bread with butter. It's very delicious and filling so thread carefully! I got the avocado chicken club and it was delicious. It was served with fries that was also good as well. The club could use less tomatoes but that's juston preference!  I will definitely come back here again!",

The wait can be long at times so we only come at odd times now.. I know people tend to hate on chain restaurants but I think CF is one of the better ones.. Their portions are huge and the food is tasty.   Must Haves: -Chicken Madeira: Everyone's favorite. Its just 2 chicken breasts with madeira sauce, cheese, mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.. If I'm trying to watch what I eat I substitute the mashed potatoes for broccoli..  -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: It is not too overly spicy and has just the right amount of kick. -Chicken Lettuce Wraps: If I want something healthy-ish that's not a salad I get this dish.. It's huge so it will fill you up.. They even have noodles as one of the toppings. -Carlton Salad: It's tasty and fresh but the dressing has a very strong sesame oil taste so you may want to ask for the dressing on the side or another dressing. -Bread: Love their bread.. Especially the sweet brown one mmmmm haha -Strawberry lemonade: Sugar rimmed glass.. perfect for a hot Vegas day   Service is always friendly and it's a fun place to people watch after or before you shop at Forums~   HOT TIP: If you decide to get a salad you can swap out lettuce for mixed field greens free of charge.. yummmm ;]]]",

I told her you cannot round my bill up and short me money. She finally gave me back my change difference after a good five minutes. Poor customer service.   My second day the server I had brought us our waters with no straws and when we asked him for straws he put his finger tips all over the mouth pieces and then placed them in our drinks. I then told him we wanted sealed straws and he went and came back. During these three times he was at our table, not once did he ask us if we were ready to order he would look at our table and go to his other tables and help them. Very rude. I had to tell him we were ready to order and after a couple of times of me telling him we were ready he finally began to change his tune. I've never seen such poor service like this at the Cheesecake Factory. It's a great place to eat with a delicious menu, but the servers at this location are bad.",

With reservations made ahead of time, everything was smooth sailing. I like that this location is quite large and that there are 2 floors of seating, although it can get pretty packed on the weekends and around dinner time. The menu is extensive so ordering is a task in itself lol. Somehow though, I always revert to my favorite Miso salmon, brown rice in lieu of white. Hubby got the Mac and Cheese burger which was cooked perfectly, rich and flavorsome. The madre got the Louisiana Chicken pasta which she thoroughly enjoyed. We also had a taste of the fish tacos which were surprisingly good, the cilantro rice is one of the best I've tried. On the kids menu: chicken tenders and fries, well it's chicken tenders and fries, nothing much to elaborate. The mac and cheese that my son ordered was unsavory to put it mildly. It was dry and bland with no flavor profile at all. Our server must've noticed my sons dislike as he took one bite and ceased eating altogether hahaha so he offered to get him something else, my son wasn't feeling very well so he opted for the bread basket instead. Our server informed us he would have the mac and cheese taken out of the bill, we told him it wasn't necessary but he insisted. A red velvet cheesecake was shared amongst us as we were too stuffed to order more. Service was cordial and timely despite the dinner rush. When the bill came and noticed the mac and cheese was not taken out, he gladly rectified the situation which in turn we added to his tip as we appreciated the effort and kind gesture.",

Dishes are the Pasta Da Vinci, orange chicken, jambalaya and Thai Lettuce wrap( get the one on the skinny menu) cuz it comes with 3 wrap prepare for you.. If sharing w/ someone than order the regular menu cuz it's a huge portion which I could never finish.. Luv Luv their cheesecake..hehe.. Well the name say it all rt?? Pricey but good.. I usually get the fresh strawberry, banana, tiramisu cheesecake.. They have so many different flavor it's unbelievable.. For some reason I always order the same one..guess I'm loyal..LOL",

Service was spot on, location was awesome next to all the great stores at Forum shops, and the food was excellent.   My favorite item has to be their chicken nachos...gotta try these! Main entree was the ribeye, seriously...for not being a steakhouse; their steak was cooked perfectly and had perfect flavor overall a perfect steak. I think they can give Flemmings and Ruth's Chris a run for their money as their steak is about $20 less and includes a side.   Once again...a Cheesecake Factory has provided an excellent experience and a desire to come back soon.",

French Country salad with beets, goat cheese, asparagus, and pecans had sparse ingredients and under-dressed. Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp with sugar snap peas and shiitake mushrooms in sweet and spicy sauce served with white rice came with super dry chicken bits, no shrimp, and uncooked rice. Server told manager who ordered just shrimp to add onto my plate, but they redid order with more dry chicken, but no pineapple which made the sauce taste different. I had to take from new plate and dip into sauce of original plate. I'm not sure what happened but I think I got three different types of shrimp. Some were medium size, others super small, and one larger one that had the shell including tail still on. I think maybe they were out of shrimp and sent original plate out hoping patron was too drunk to notice there was no shrimp. It is just sad that if you were going to fake a dish that you would at least cook the chicken well. Neither the server or manager cared to notice I barely touched the plate. Btw, you'all need to trim your sugar snap peas so it's edible and won't choke anyone.",

When we went we were seated straight away even though the entire top section of the restaurant was closed which was unusual for this location.  After asking for the enchiladas with \"no sliced up peppers or onions on top but sauces would be totally fine\" we received a plate with plain white rice, 3 flour tortillas and some plain unseasoned chicken breast. No tomatillo sauce or salsa at all. When we sent it back the restaurant manager came back 20 min later, mumbled something under his breath and slammed down the same meal, cold with some tomatillo sauce thrown on top.  Probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Disgraceful.",

We stayed at Caesars and this was so convenient. The one in Edina, MN is also beautiful.   My husband and I came here for Sunday brunch and it was so delicious. We ordered the cult classic appetizer Avocado Eggrolls, and coffees to start. I got the Pancakes, 2 eggs and bacon. He got the Monte Christo - a phenomenal French Toast club-style sandwich with ham, bacon, scrambled eggs, swiss cheese - and it comes with strawberry preserves on the side. It was huge, I had to help him finish it!  Probably one of the best things we ate at this year's Vegas retreat.   At the end of the day, we walked back there just to get dessert. We shared the Celebration Cheesecake, a melt in your mouth combination of pink and blue cheesecakes with vanilla cake layers, topped with fresh cream and sprinkles. We sat down by the Fountains of the Gods inside the Forum Shops and ate our cake. It was an outstanding day. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.",

Honest mistake? Maybe. But, at least check in from time to time. A second Drink might have helped us wait for food.   One plate actually just came cold. Interesting.   Highly Unsatisfied.

The bread is also good especially the darker one.   For the entrees, we chose Miso salmon and shrimp scampi. Both were really good. And there were plenty of shrimp with the scampi and the sauce was amazing. The sauce on the Mrs. salmon was also very delicious. I opted for mashed potatoes instead of the rice.   Of course when you come here, you have to get cheesecake and we chose the white chocolate macadamia which was at the perfect choice!",

I asked her why I was being charged 4.00 for a small side of marinara and she asked if I wanted to speak with a manager but since I had already waited 6 minutes for my food, I didn't have time.

    "text": "In general, I try to avoid chain restaurants because if it is a chain I can eat their food all throughout the country. Also, I have seen Cheesecake Factory's gluten free menu and it contained close to nothing for me to eat without morphing the dish into something remarkably healthy (no sauce, dressing, fries, etc). Now, there are times that I want to be healthy, but that's why I cook at home, not when I go to a restaurant called CHEESECAKE Factory. Therefore, my fiance have avoided this restaurant in Caesar's until St. Patrick's Day when friends wanted something familiar to eat.  First, the hostess desk was on top of their game. I got a piece of paper with my approximate waiting time and the time I checked into the desk. They took my phone number to call me when my table was ready which is GENIUS in Vegas. We stayed within the casino, so when they called we came running and the table was ready. Service? It was actually pretty good. I didn't walk away wow-ed by the service, but it was good. Our waters were almost always full, my friends got refills on the bread, butter and alcoholic drinks relatively fast and all went okay. The server split our bills with the greatest of ease since we told him at the beginning of the meal we'd prefer split bills. CF gets the extra 1 star for the host desk organization and service alone.  Yes, this menu is impressive. Salads, pizzas, Chinese, Italian and of course, massive amounts of cheesecake. I looked through the menu and saw the plethora of carb-tastic happiness. I saw a stack of onion straws go by me and I remembered my days of gluten-ingesting intestinal pain. However, I think that stack of onion straws, the flatbread and the pasta could absolutely be worth it. The menu for you gluten-lovers is great. Somewhat predictable, but great.   My friends eating gluten all loved their food! My fiance got a basic burger, another got the Steak Diane, one got the Kobe burger with American cheese (wrong cheese, but moving forward) and the last guy got the Mac and Cheese burger. I ordered the safest item on the menu for someone that is gluten free which is the lemon and herb chicken with mashed potatoes. It seemed safe at the time, and even though I wasn't starving, I didn't want to be ill for the rest of the night.   Nobody complained about their food. Everyone said it was great and that they were completely satisfied with their meals. The fries looked pretty standard. I expected a little more pizazz with their fries since everything else was so extravagant, but they were simple. The burgers did not look appealing to me, and I love beef, but then again, everyone except my fiance ordered their cow medium and that hurts my heart. My chicken? Hands down some of the best chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. The best thing? There were bones in the chicken, but the large ones were removed and the chicken came right off the bone. Don't even get me started on the magic wonder of the lemon butter sauce. I could have clogged my arteries with more of that sauce any day. I didn't get sick from the restaurant, and that chicken may pull me back one of these days. Please feel free to take away the red mashed potatoes which were okay, but nothing exciting and almost didn't deserve to be on the plate with that butter and chicken. Replace the potatoes with more chicken and we're good.  I know this one was long, but I like to approach a meal from all different angles. I wanted to give this restaurant 3 stars because for me, the GF options were severely lacking for a major chain restaurant, but what I did eat was great and the restaurant organization was on-point. If you want something that's not specifically Vegas but reliable and perfect for picky eaters, come to Cheesecake Factory and you'll be happy with your choice.",

    "text": "Like other reviewers, I am not necessarily a fan of the chain restaurant. Particularly in Las Vegas when there are so many other great choices of places to eat. That being said, I had my 3rd ever experience at any Cheesecake Factory recently as I was joining some of my wife's colleagues for a pre-show dinner before we were to go see Cher. The place was hopping, but looked very large.  My first impression of this location was great! The staff were very friendly, and despite not having a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend, our party of 8 was able to be seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Our waiter was excellent. Most of us were either CCF newbies or seldom diners and we were all full of questions about drinks or menu items. Our waiter was very patient, helpful and humorous. I had quite a few questions about the veggie friendly items, and he was very good at answering my questions.  As far as the food and drink. I was happy to find a couple microbrews on the menu, and I opted for the Hefe. The rest of our party enjoyed one of the many cocktails that the CCF offers. All of our drinks came out at the same time, and only after about 5 minutes after we ordered. I ordered the nachos minus the meat and edamame, and most of the table also ordered apps. The portion sizes on these apps was massive, and we probably could have only ordered 4 for the entire table. I was able to conquer about 1/2 the nachos and had significant help with the edamame. Our service was quick, which we needed since we had a show at 7:30pm. Our check came fast (but not too fast) and was worked out very quickly.   Overall, it was a great experience. Our bill was actually very reasonable especially noting how much food we got. The service was great and the location perfect for what we needed. I probably won't be a CCF regular, but I will definitely be open to dining there again. My only concern was that gratuity was not added to our bill (even though we had 8 people) which was different than I am used to seeing. That could be a problem for people who don't look too closely at their bill.",

If all of them are as good as the one in Caesars Palace, then I've got a standby in every Metropolitan city in the country. This place is good.  The menu is gigantic, bordering on overwhelming. Most of the food was outstanding. My Salsbury steak was deluged with sage (not my favorite spice). That was about my only knock on the food. If only I had oredred one of the other 1400 items on the menu.  The service was nice and attentive.

This  is located at the end of Forum Shops at  Caesar Palace (where the animatronic show  begins every hour).  They have at least 18 pages (including a whole page of cheesecakes to choose from) on the menu with a variety of items to choose from. The waiter we had was very friendly and helpful in choosing the item she recommend. My mom and I both ordered Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane ($19.95 each)  and ordered caesar salad ($3 each). Our waiter brings our salad and  bread to our table. While I enjoyed the bread (especially the wheat bread) I didn't enjoy the caesar salad. The lettuce had bitter taste to it and the salad did not come with anything ( ex: cheese, onions, tomato,etc) that should be on it. I will say the ranch was delicious. About 30 mins later our waiter brought our entrees to our table.  The steak I had was tender and delicious and  the chicken Madeira  with cheese was average. My mom thought her food was good also.  For dessert, I ordered the original cheesecake which was yummy! This place get pretty pricey ($60 was the check for  two of us) but was worth every penny.  I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas or when I'm  nearby one and would recommend those who haven't dine here to check this place out. It's something for everyone!!",

I had a vegetarian pasta that, while very tasty, made me feel like it expanded to about twice its' normal size in my belly about a half hour later.  Not a good feeling . . .  The avocado egg rolls were very welcome to two Californians on vacation but needing their avocado fix, but they were a little salty.  So, if you're in a diverse group that's hard to please, it might be worth the stop, or if you want a meal with a cheesecake dessert, then obviously this is a great choice, but for True culinary satisfaction, keep on' truckin . . .",

    "text": "I was eating solo this night and was starving when I was perusing the Caesars mall. I decided to go for a known quantity since I have known CF for years. I ate at the bar and had my usual soda and small chopped salad and bread. It came out to $15 bucks with tip. That's CHEAP by Vegas standards. The small salads are a good deal b/c CF gives you a huge amount of food in the main entrees and so these are just the right generous portion and most hotel rooms have no place to refrigerate or heat up your doggy bag anyways.  Bar staff was great. I think it was Tim that helped me. Always made sure to keep my glass filled. Kudos to him and he's cute to boot.  Verdict: Okay so CF is a chain that is everywhere nowadays, but it's nice to find someplace that is a known quantity, fed me in less than an hour, and isn't charging 50% more than their normal outlets and has a nice bar staff.",

Although i didn't taste much alcohol in it but it's delicious!  I use to only order the Navajo sandwich which has chicken, avocado, tomato, onions, lettuce in a fry bread. But then I started ordering the MISO SALMON. & Oh my goodness!!! My new favorite dish. Salmon was cooked to perfection, very moist, and was on top of a bead of rice. Surrounding the rice was some kind of creamy white sauce which was amazing and compliments the dish very well, along with chikapeas. I asked the server what sauce it was and she said its some kind of lemon sauce which didn't taste like it at all. Seemed like it has some mayo in it mixed with something else. My mom said it tasted like it had some coconut cream in it. I'll have to ask the server again.  I highly recommend the miso salmon!!  & of course the love the bread and butter :)",

    "text": "Never did I actually think going to The Cheesecake Factory would be one of my highlights of my Vegas trip recently for a convention. Not only did we have one of our better nights here, but we actually spent about 4 hours sitting at the bar. No lie. That was our second night in a row there.   Our first night, we came for dinner and didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a table. We quickly snagged a corner seat at the bar and were helped by Jeremy (The guy that looks like \"the guy from Jarhead\" aka Jake Gyllenhaal). We both ordered the fish tacos, but Jeremy suggested the plate was big and we could probably split it, which we ended up doing and didn't regret it because it was a LOT. The only gripe I would have is that the rice was strange. I have no idea what was in it, but it was strange. He was quick and attentive-- perfect dinner service!   The next night, we opted going straight to the bar again, and were helped by Jose & William. William, hands down, knows which dishes are worth getting and will steer you away from something you may regret ordering later. HANDS DOWN this guy's got the menu memorized. I even was able to test his knowledge about what was in certain dishes, and he was able to answer without hesitation; and if anyone's ever been in the Cheesecake Factory, you know their menus are 80-page books. He was able to suggest the Miso Salmon & the Veggie Salad, both of which we ordered and were NOT disappointed (seriously, order these items). He can also make a mean \"Jolly Rancher\" shot! Jose was one of my favorite bartenders... basically ever. This guy's been bartending for 8 years, and you can really tell. He has an awesome attitude, a great smile, and is efficient as heck (he also bartends events, so if you're ever looking to find someone to do your event, he's your man!) He can make great conversation, tell some insane stories, but will still finish the hundreds of drink orders that are coming in. I feel like after the 4 hours we spent sitting at the bar, we made some great Cheesecake Factory friends. I wish this particular CF were local, but alas, anything in Vegas stays in Vegas, and I guess that goes for the bartenders/service we've had here.   Until we decide to have many more glasses of wine at the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops; cheers!",

I am looking around like... hello? Another 5 mins and nothing happens.  I get up and have to flag down some other server for my iced tea and ask for our bread.  \"I'll check\" he says. A few mins later HE brings the bread, not our waitress.   Then she comes by \"oh sorry, they were baking it\" - BS., I could see other tables being brought bread all the time. 5 more mins go by and she then comes back for our order.  2 entrees and a salad. My salad comes a few mins later with the tiniest portion of dressing on the side.  I finish the dressing with 1/2 the salad to go.... huh?  I start looking around for 'someone' to ask for more dressing.  Literally nobody there even looking around to help me.  Then our server brings the food... \"here is your order, are you done with your salad?\".  Uh, no I needed more dressing but I could flag nobody down to bring me any more.  \"Do you want me to get you more dressing now?\".  I tell her no, I don't have that long to wait.  Bottom line, the food was great.  The service SUCKED.  Worst ever at a Cheesecake Factory.  And they were not busy!  There was no excuse for it.  Our server had an attitude and just did not care about her customers at all.  I left in a really pissed off mood.",

The wait was only 15-20 minutes and since we were there for lunch we weren't sure how the portions were. We only had dinner at cheesecake and never lunch. So we asked about the lunch portions and still it was huge. My friend and I ended up sharing the BBQ chicken cobb salad which I absolutely love and my other friend got their fish and chips.  Service was fine. They were quick to get things to your table and our server was super nice. The food was the same as the one near brea mall, but it seemed the one here in vegas paid more attention to it because our salad wasn't drenched in the dressing. It seemed to be perfected dressed and you can taste the different tastes rather than everything having one flavor. That was probably the distinction between the two places which was nice for a change.",

I had Joe's Special [check out the pic] which was an egg scramble with mushrooms, onions, chicken sausage, and spinach with potatoes and toast.  It was very tasty. YUM.  I also had the drink- typhoon punch  to go with it and it was very good. Haha a cocktail with breakfast! YUM!

    "text": "I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, but I am in Vegas with my kids and I wanted a child friendly place to eat.  This was a pretty good choice.   We went there at 8 PM on a Friday night, and there was an anticipated 35 minute wait - but they gave us a piece of paper and told us to come back in half an hour.  That gave us time to check out the nearby stores and watch the \"Fall of Atlantis\" show right outside.  Unfortunately, it took an extra ten minutes before the anticipated time before we got seated and the kids were quite tired by then.  The prices were pretty reasonable. My Monterey burger came with cheese, onions, arugula and avocado an was $12, plus an extra one to substitute the fries with sweet potato fries.  The burger was good, though not as juicy as I'd like it (I ordered it medium rare), but the fries were phenomenal.    My oldest had the pasta alfredo ($7), but she was disappointed by the lack of flavor.  Unfortunately our waiter was too busy so we seldom saw him and we couldn't ask him for Parmessan cheese before she was finished.  My youngest had the kids cheese pizza ($6), which was the size of a regular dinner plate - basically, adult size.  The pizza tasted like an Italian pizza margherita rather than your typical American cheese pizza, so she didn't like it.  I, however, did.  All the portions were large enough that we all took leftovers to our hotel (which fortunately has a kitchenette).  Of course, the only reason why the kids were willing to go to the Cheesecake Factory was the name, so we went on to have cheesecake.  The HUGE slices were $7 each, very reasonable IMHO, but I come from a city where food is grossly overpriced.  I had the Adam's Peanut Butter fudge cheesecake, and I would not recommend it.  It was way too sweet to allow for any cheesecake flavor to filter through.  My oldest had the Dulce de Leche cheesecake, which she enjoyed.  I liked it more than mine because it was less sweet, but next time I'll go for the plain cheesecake.  My youngest had the kids hot fudge sundae ($2!).  It was a large enough portion that she couldn't finish it.  In all, if you can deal with the wait and share dishes (or take the leftovers home for later), this seems like a good and reasonably priced place to dine in Vegas - no wonder there was such a huge wait!",

But then our legs started to push back against us. We were wondering around the Forum when we realized a break was need. So we stopped in Cheesecake and got ourselves some much needed water and nachos (food in general was need so we went with nachos). The plate was huge and delicious but they may have just been because of my state of mind.  Any way this is a pretty normal cheesecake. It looks pretty nice but in reality they are all about the same. I regretted that I was so hungry that I did not try to find a place to eat that does not already exist at home.",

The cashier said 20 minutes, and I came back at 15 minutes and saw a bag near the register.  After waiting 5 minutes for the people ordering cheesecake to get their orders, I got her attention and asked if it was mine.  She said yes but she was waiting on the mac and cheese.  After another ten minutes she said it shouldn't be much longer, and finally went back to check and came out with it.  I said my dinners had to be ice cold by now and she very rudely said it's fine and handed me the bag.  When I opened the dinners a few minutes later (it only took three minutes to get back to Caesars) the food was ice cold and garbage.  It was almost a half hour from when the dinners came out until the dried up mac and cheese was added.  Totally unacceptable that a takeout order leaves the kitchen before everything is ready.  We threw most of it out because it was inedible.",

It was honestly the first place we saw in the forum shops which didn't make either one of us go \"meh\".   I didn't feel like a burger so settled on a spicy crispy chicken sandwich. It really didn't have a spice to it but it didn't taste too bad. The service was excellent, however. I go thru a ton of pop refills, especially when I'm out walking and wandering, and the server was on it.   There wasn't a wait to get seated, but they made us go upstairs - wait, there's a 2nd floor to a restaurant on the forums, it must have an awesome view! - nah, don't get too excited. It's a small, enclosed space with the only view being that of the other tables. The middle is cut out so you can look down on the bar, but that's about it.",

This one was located inside of the Forum Shops at Caesers. Outside of the restaurant was very crowded due to customers going in and out and the little fire show that goes on right outside of the restaurant. I'm glad we asked for seats deeper inside because we ended up getting a 2 person booth which was way more quite and had more of a private feel to it.   The service we received here was excellent. Everything we asked for got there in no time by one of the waiters even if we had asked another one of them. We were impressed. The food was good too. I have some chicken pesto pasta dish and my husband got the fish tacos. We both liked our food and the Adios Long Island drinks were strong and awesome.   We really had a good time at this place but were just too full by the end to try any of their cheesecake desserts - which means we will have to go back for another visit.",

My boyfriend (vegan) and I (vegetarian) were armed in the knowledge that, with the insanely large menu the Factory boasts, there will surely be something for us here. We shared the lettuce wrap appetizer, and I had the margareta flatbread, then a grown-up milkshake for dessert.  Because we ordered the lettuce wrap sans-poultry, the server brought us avocado to sub. This was the most surprising part of the meal: the lettuce wrap consisted of ultra fresh, crisp vegetables and delicious sauces. I would absolutely order this again, though I'm not much for salady wrap things.  My flatbread was crisp and warm (it's hard to mess up a margareta pizza, and the Cheesecake Factory provided the standard delicious flavour I'm expecting.) The milkshake included caramel, pretzels, booze, ice cream, whipped cream. An insane indulgence but truly flavourful, and I highly recommend this if (like me) you love the sweet and salty combination.  The FORVM Atlantis fountain show in the background can get irritating if you're not seated within the restaurant. (FFS, pick an heir to the kingdom already, aargh.)  For a large-scale, affordable (for Vegas) chain-restaurant, Cheesecake Factory offered us surprisingly fresh food and efficient service.",

So appetizer one factory burger/ fries one chicken club sandwich/fries one glass of wine two glasses of iced tea and one slice of  Lemon meringue pie which I might add was very very good $72 with tip included overrated and expensive. To be fair this review does not pertain to the cheesecake factory location on Las Vegas Blvd., South, I was reviewing the cheesecake factory in Green Valley In Henderson I just could not find it in the database",

Seriously - I was sliding around the joint.  I'm like - what is this Ice Capades?  Cheesecake Factory is the only place in Vegas where you can pirouette while deep throating a burger.

    "text": "It was our first night staying at Caesars and I was a bit worn out from the drive, so I didn't feel like going too far for dinner. At about 8:30 we went into the Forum Shops area and found a number of places that looked good. One of the last we ran across was the Cheesecake Factory. We didn't want anything that fancy and had dined at different Cheesecake Factory restaurants many times so we decided that this would be fine. We ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a Pizza.  While we were waiting, all of a sudden, loud throbbing music filled the indoor courtyard. We asked the server what was going on and were told that the Nike store next door was having a promotion or kick-off of some sort. The music was a non-stop throbbing `new-age' sound which was NOT pleasant.  The Pizza was eventually served, but w/out the Chicken Caesar salad. While sharing the pizza, the music suddenly stopped. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! Within just minutes there was an explosion and flames coming from the top of the aquarium in the center of the indoor courtyard. Then large animated figurines rose from amidst the flames and went into a `skit' for the people on the other side of the aquarium. It, too, was almost deafening w/ continued explosions and background sounds. As it was directed away from us we could not make out the dialog, just the explosions and screaming.  Well, we're on our second piece of pizza and the manager comes to the table stating that the Chicken Caesar salad would be a bit longer. I told him to forget it. He asked if I was sure and I replied, 'yes'. So, as we're starting our 3rd (and last) slice of pizza... out comes the Chicken Caesar salad. Plop... not a word... and the server (not our waiter) walks away. I nibbled at it, but wasn't that hungry and left most in the bowl.  Just as we are about to ask for the check the `skit' ends. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! The Nike noise returns... along with the check which includes the Chicken Caesar. I run down the server and recant my conversation w/ the manager. He says he'll look into it and after about 5 minutes returns with the check w/o the Chicken Caesar. At this point all we wanted to do was leave, so we didn't wait for change, leaving a 25%+ tip for service worth about 10% and an experience worth avoiding.",

We happen to get there when the Atlantis show was going on which made it even louder. The food was excellent. It was hot, great tasting and plenty of it. I left full and with a doggy bag.

Although the manager came over, he didn't apologize or anything. He just said, it will be out in two minutes...and it took another 8-10. In addition to this debacle, drinks took forever to come out and they forgot to give us basic condiments like syrup for our french toast. This was a really horrible experience.

I went to this place a lot when I was smaller, but I wasn't judging the food at that age.   My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary while in Vegas. It was kind of a weird situation. We waiting a long time for a table since this place doesn't take reservations (bummer!) Then we sat next these 2 women who were arguing with each other at the table! I am not sure of they were friends or mother and daughter???   We ordered the Factory chopped salad that is tossed with a balsamic dressing. The salad has apples, bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, and a bunch of other yummy veggies that tie in with the dressing beautifully! As we were enjoying the salad, the two woman finished their argument and began a conversation with us! They started to recommend dishes that they like there and then were talking smack on other dishes, including the salad that we loved at this point! Anyways, they recommended the Chicken Piccatta and it was a hit with us! But watch out for the portion size! We were able to split the dish and still had a little left over. The chicken is cooked with a white sauce and capers...but we requested that the capers be left out ( I am not a fan). It comes with a size of pasta that compliments the chicken well.   And for dessert, of course cheesecake! They have so many to choose from!!!! how can one make that decision??!! A few of my favs from there: The chocolate mousse cheesecake, the carrot cake cheesecake, the original flavor, and the tuxedo. You can also get the original flavor and there is a variety of fruit toppings that you can have added if you choose.   All in all, this place rocks! They have a huge menu of entree items and the same size menu for the cheesecake! The service is really good but it is a very noisy restaurant, so if you are a looking for a quiet environment, this is not the place. The entrees are decently priced for the amount of food that you get. The cheesecake can be a little pricey ($6.95 a slice for most), but its soooooo worth it!   If I could change one thing, I would have them start taking reservations!   I will be back for many years to come! Enjoy all!",

    "text": "We wanted to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday while in Vegas. Hmm, where will they sing to her?  So even though I stuffed myself to the gills at the Village Buffet, we decided to surprise my friend for her birthday because that's how you show people you love them. We came at an off time, so there wasn't a wait. We sat upstairs (there is an elevator beside the staircase) at a round table in the corner. Hmm, what to eat when you don't want to eat? My friends ordered a bunch of appies, but I wanted to eat some veggies... lunch special sized Cobb Salad it is. When they dropped off the bread, everyone pounced. Ahh, I love the soft, warm bread with butter... I didn't really need to eat anymore.  The cobb salad is all mixed up instead of being a composed salad. It was very well mixed with an appropriate amount of dressing... not too little, not too much... just right. I love bacon... I love bacon with blue cheese... I love bacon with blue cheese and lettuce... this salad was huge, so I only finished like half. I would have taken it back to the hotel, but in a city of excess, I figured I would just find food someplace else... and I'm glad I did because I think our fridge was broken. The slice of red velvet cheesecake we took back did not fare so well... and melted. I almost cried.  Our server was so nice and even though she disappeared for a while, she remembered to bring a candle and brought some other to sing to my friend. We always have a nice time at all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants... always so consistent.",

BUT, this Cheesecake Factory made that issue 100x easier. Their management came by our table and showed my sister exactly what she could eat and what they could substitute/take out. If they didn't know, they would contact the chef.   THAT. IS. AWESOME.   And they didn't ever make my sister feel bad or show any signs of irritation when she had questions.   Also, everyone at our table loved what they ordered. BRAVO.",

Only issue was the seating process.  they took our name, had us come back after 15 minutes, and then made us all stand there for another 15 minutes (there were about 20 other groups waiting too).  it would be much better to either have a buzzer option or maybe a text option.  I've been to the Cheesecake factory all over the country - seating hasn't been an issue before so maybe this is new.",

    "text": "Love the cheesecakes but not so much the food. Since I can't eat a whole lot of sweets I mainly order the Thai Lettuce Wraps, it's probably the best thing on the menu besides the dessert.   You would think Thai Lettuce Wraps is hard to mess up on, but sadly they burnt my chicken. It was a total disappointment for me! As for the pastas they are A-O-K; the Cajun jambalaya is probably the best one. Made to perfection! Most of the other pastas seem to be dry (lack of sauce).   Best part of all DESSERT! I love the red velvet cheesecake, so if you haven't tried it yet I would definitely try it.   As for service, not the best, the server forgot a lot of things and would disappear out of no where when I needed him. Not only did he forget to get my drink but he messed up on other peoples order.",

    "text": "I was here last night to have a dinner with my friends as they were craving pasta. We were quoted a 15 minute wait, which was pretty accurate. After a short wait, we were taken to a nice booth seat, and our server came right away. We ordered some cocktails and th buffalo chicken as appetizers. Their cocktails are pretty big for their price and they tasted very good- we ordered blood orange margarita, blood orange mojito and pina colada. With our cocktails, the server brought us some warm breads with butter, which were good as well.   The buffalo chicken was a deep fried dish of buffalo marinaded chicken chunks. However, there wasn't enough cheese or chicken inside the fried skin, so we had to end up just digging for the chicken to not get full from the fried part. As soon as we were done with our appetizers, our pastas were served. The portions were enourmous, like how cheesecake serves all their foods.   Along with two bowtie pastas that my friends ordered which seemed fine, my shrimp scampi failed. The angel hair was dry when serves, there was no sauce, and it seemed like it was waiting for the kitchen line for awhile to be served. The shrimp was not sauteed as mentioned on their description but it was deep fried-and remember their appetizer was heavily fried as well. There was just not enough sauce for the whole dish to feel moist. The shrimps were so heavy that it did not go well with the angel hair. Also, their garlics were not sliced at all; but served in chunks.   Their service was good, but if I were to go back again, I would stay with the skinny side of their menu, since they do not deep fry every ingredient.",

It has a cozy ambience in a very cool section of the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. Typically we have had to wait to get in but this trip we got a table right away. With the huge potions it's hard to leave room for the cheesecake, but in the past we have walked from the Mirage or Treasure Island just to get a piece.",

Second we got seated in a section where there was food on the floor and the server Shawn took over 20 minutes to even walk over and get our drink order. We were very upset by then because our two little girls were hungry and ready to eat. Then, once he came over he took our order for drinks and food at once, the good thing in our appetizer came out very quick which was a lifesaver. However, our food is a different story, it took SO long for it to get to us and when it did, my husband's rice was so hard and he sent it back to be replaced. After waiting for Shawn to get back to us to let him know about it he rice. The plate was brought back to much later with the same orange chicken which was cold by then with the rice replaced. As we were having our meal, finally, our drinks were not refilled and we had spent so much time there that the option of getting dessert was not even something we wanted to wait for so we got it at the cashier on our way out. Not from Shawn, he is not a very good server at all and we were extremely disappointing by our decision to dine at this location.",

    "text": "The food is mediocre. 10 years ago, this place used to be good, but now it's like an Applebee's with higher prices. The reason for even 2 stars is because of the service and the cheesecakes are great! I would only come here to eat a cheesecake. Other than that, the food is 1 star.  Here is my 2 cents. They have like 20 pages of food and it's like reading a damn book, trying to get through the whole menu and trying to figure out what you want. That's like a 10 min ordeal just going through all those pages and by that time, you really worked up an appetite. With such a huge selection, how does the company expect to make good food and perfect a dish? They can't with 100 dishes they have to cook and remember. Id just shoot myself if I was the chef and had to memorize that menu and try to cook it. Condense the menu and make at least one thing right and delicious.  The pasta I got was bland and said light marinara. It was drenched in Mariana and it was suppose to have a lemon and garlic taste. Didn't taste anything but bland tomato sauce. My bf got chicken and biscuits. The chicken was a joke. It looked like thin floppy slices that you get from a container to.make sandwiches. Im not even sure if it was chicken. McDonald's sells better and bigger chicken breasts. Seriously, the chicken looked so flat, it looked like a flat pancake. Very unappealing and unnatural. It's a shame that this place went downhill.",

And speaking of options, there is something for everyone here. The menu is like a novel. I can see this being a great place for large families, because one person may want Mexican another pasta, etc. The service here was very good. They came to refill water often. I had a roasted chicken dish with potatoes and carrots. I was pleasantly surprised, being that it is a chain restaurant. The portions were plenty and there was no room for yummy cheesecake.

Of all the multiple times I've been here, there have only been a few times where the wait is kinda long, and it will be for you too, especially if you're there during the early evenings or/and the weekends.  Me and my friends typically make our way to this place around 9 or so, about an hour before it closes and the place is usually not that crowded, or winding down. We seem to typically get our food faster this way.  But screw the food, we all know I come here for the cheesecake. I've had the red velvet, the chocolate godiva, the tiramisu, and jacked some banana creme from my friends plate. No not in one sitting you asshole, over multiple visits! I've never had any complaints. It's so delicious that even if I'm too full after a meal, I'll still take cheesecake to go. Chocolate Godiva cheesecake is the cheesecake of gods and it descended from the heavens into this restaurant and if you don't eat it, you're wrong. Forshame!  The food can be hit or miss. Typically their Asian cuisine is pretty spot on. It may not be authentic, but it sure is tasty. I think the only bad thing I've ever really had here is the chicken and biscuits. It's like, swimming in gravy, and I hate soup. Their veggie burger is kinda sad too, just fell apart in my hands. Steak is definitely the way to go.  The alcoholic drinks are good game too. While a bit pricey, I can slurp down 4 of those orangy-fruity things before the meal gets there.",

    "text": "I usually try to avoid going to the Strip as much as I can when visiting, because I hated being around the strip when I lived there, and I sure do not love it even now. However, my friends insisted on going to the Cheesecake Factory for brunch, and I haven't actually eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before (except that one time I tried their cheesecakes, which were pretty good), so sure, why not.  Located inside the Forum Shops at the Caesars Palace, this is definitely a touristy place. It's huge with lots of seating and it's located right in front of that aquarium thing with the show every hour or so. Actually, we chose to seat outside, and one of those shows started playing, which could be a bit annoying since they dim all the lights and it's really loud.   Anyway, back to the food. I got the French toast. Overall, it wasn't bad. It was cooked well and the inside was nice and custardy. It wasn't too sweet either, which I really don't like on my French toasts, so that was a good thing! It was ok, didn't blow me away, but wasn't disappointing either.  The service was great. Our server was patient with us and regularly refilled our drinks. He even informed me that my food was going to take a while to be served, since the first batch got burnt. I definitely appreciated him letting me know that.   Overall, food was decent and priced not outrageously. Service was nice! It's definitely one of those touristy places though. So if you're visiting, this would be a great place to dine. However, if you don't like touristy places, or just don't like being at the Strip, then you might want to consider someplace else.",

I thought it'd be overrated and regular but I actually enjoyed myself.  There isn't a Cheesecake Factory here in AK so I had to give it a try while I was in Vegas. Ordered their Ribeye Steak medium rare with Mac & cheese and Mash potatoes. I judge a lot of restaurants based off of their ability to cook steak correctly. I'm no snob or highly experienced chef but cooking steak isn't exactly easy so if a restaurant can cook a steak properly, it gets major kudos from me. They not only cooked my steak perfectly but even the cut itself was of high quality. Maybe I'm exaggerating but it tasted and looked perfect. The mac & cheese was gooey goodness and the potatoes was good also. I ordered an Oreo Cheesecake to go which was fancy smancy yumminess but I expected that considering the name of the place. I wish we had one up here and I can't wait for my next visit.",

We also ordered the Louisiana Pasta which we had to send back to the kitchen because there was almost no sauce on the pasta. Salads were good but I asked for the smallest caesar &  she ended up bringing & charging me for the bigger one. We had to ask for lemons for our water 4 times before finally getting them.

Times have changed and while the pasts is not vegan and like pretty much no entree is veganizable - I had a great meal! our server was amazing - she pretty much just created a vegan feast (plain and simple though) out of sides, appetizers and salad.

Usually we wait a good thirty minutes at the Boca Park spot. We got a table for two outside of the restaurant so there was some really good people watching.  This is RIGHT outside of the Caesar's show thing they do so it did get a little darker and noisier when the show was happening but it doesn't last TOO long.  Camille had her usual, Bow tie pasta in marina and loved it.  And I ordered my usual: Chicken Chipotle Pasta. I felt like it wasn't as spicy as when I usually get it and it was definitely saucier, watery if you will. It was still delish but I've had it on better days.  I also ordered a Red Sangria and it was delish!   We will definitely be back to this location though!",

Horrible customer service for one! The host was rude and had this angry look on her face, expressing how much she hates the world and the people in front of her. We were seated quickly. Guess that was the highlight of the night. The server comes up and greeted us, ask if we would like some starters or a beverage. Took the order and came back 15 mins later, placed 2 of the 4 drinks on the table. Never gave us any straws... another strike in the books... came back 5 minutes after that to give us the other two drinks. We ordered food, ended up waiting 45+ mins for a fettuccine alfredo, 4 cheese pasta, a chicken quesadilla and a cheese burger. Keeping in mind that the restaurant wasn't even really that busy.. (Lame...) my mother in law then noticed a piece of stretch wrap melted in her pasta!!!!! The chicken in the pasta had no seasoning on it at all. My 4 cheese pasta looked as if it was sitting on the hot table baking for hours. We then called our server and brought it to her attention. She said sorry and sent the manager to our table. The manager apologized and said sorry, we wrap our chicken in plastic when breading the chicken to freeze it and that sometimes this issue happens. (Who says that?!!!) what kind of manager would explain to you that it just happens and sorry. He then asked if we wanna try anything else on the menu. We said no thank you and may we have the check please?. The server came back and said, I have something that will make you guys happy again!!! She then said I have dessert menus!!!! We said no thank you check please. She came back and said my manager took that one plate off your bill. The bill should have been discounted in total!!! None of us even finished our food after mom found that plastic!!! This location is really slackin.. I'm still replaying what the manager said to us in my head. (Yeah, sometimes it happens.) I work in the food industry and tonight was unacceptable!!!!! The GM needs to step it up. I used to LOVE Cheesecake Factory!! Now I feel that this night ruined it for me. The other location at the outlet mall was a bust as well. I will not be returning, nor will I be recommending anyone to go here!!!",

I had their chicken Alfredo and it was very yummy the chicken was tender and the pasta was cooked perfectly not over cooked not under cooked but just perfect. We were too full to have dessert but their red velvet cheesecake is pretty awesome we took come to go and had it later :)",

Today things are not much better at the Boca Park location so I basically stopped going. No place is worth waiting for over 30 minuets and that's too long. I know they serve huge portions and you definitely pay for it, but who really needs so much?  Not me...I must say some of the options are quite tasty, but it's definitely not the place to go if you don't eat large portions or like me bring home a doggie bag that lasts 2 days The cheese cake is excellent and sometimes you wait 30 minuets or more just to order cheesecake at the cheesecake counter.  Sorry, no matter how good the restaurant is, I will not wait over 15 minuets with an extra 5 minute buffer.",

They have a large selection of food, too much to choose from. Having so many options can get dangerous haha. I ordered the miso salmon from the lunch menu. It was a good portion, just enough to get me full and leave room for dessert.  Just like the food menu there is a large selection of cheesecake and other desserts here. Today we ordered the strawberry shortcake and the new salted caramel cheesecake. Strawberry shortcake was really good but the cheesecake was a little too sweet for my tasting. I would come back here.",

They have two floors and a seating area out in the front to enjoy the hourly show and huge fish tank (and people watching... who am I kidding). All of my waiters & waitresses have done a great job and making sure my needs were met :) The ambiance is like every other Cheesecake Factory; dim and romantic.  My most recent time here I ordered the Renee Special. It is half of a sandwich, a bowl of soup, and a small side salad. All of it was great! The only thing is the salad was a little bland and only had leaves and balsamic vinaigrette. The soup was incredible! Cream of chicken with bacon bits on top. The half of sandwich was really good as well.  I would recommend Cheesecake Factory for anyone, the menu is extensive enough to meet anyone's craving needs!",

It's in the the Cesar Forum shops right next to the Zeus Atlantis show. It's not a bad location and the surrounding is nice to look at!  Okay the food...wow. Their huge menu was off putting but the food I ordered silenced my apprehension.   I ordered the portabella, avocado and zucchini appetizer. I never eat fried food but I'm happy I ordered it. Enjoy the finer, fattening things in life sometimes.   My main dish was the fish tacos! Hell yes! I loved it! Fish was cooked perfectly and it came with black beans and rice. I was full by the end of the meal. Please try this place out and enjoy your time in a great city.",

Customer service was subpar, we had to ask our waiter several times for bread and water, which he kept giving us ice water although we nicely asked for water no ice. No big deal but the little things add up. He was inattentive and he didn't even seem that busy because the tables next to us were also waiting on him. He didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink besides water, and we didn't see him again until the courses came out. I went over to the bar and ordered my own drinks after 30 minutes of waiting. He rushed us out at the end. \"Are you ready for me to take this\"? But repeat 7x. Dude may have just been having a bad day but when the cheesecake tasted chalky at the end, I left feeling disappointed in the amount of money I spent. Even worse, I reached out to the Cheesecake Factory customer service team and never heard back.",

Large menu with tons of variety you are sure to find something that will suit your fancy. Some would say a bit overpriced, but portions are sized to match in my opinion.  My family loves the \"brown bread\" and we have found that the servers will gladly bring you a basket with just the bread of your liking.  What I liked about this location was the waiting process. When you approach the host stand if there is going to be a wait they hand you a card and tell you to come back after X minutes from the time written on the card (which is the time you first check in). This gives you time to wander and shop.  In my experience, upon your return they are able to seat you pretty much immediately. If a table comes up before the noted wait time then they will call out your name, but if you happen to not hear or you are in another shop no worry.",

My SO loves the herb roasted chicken ($18.50). It's very flavorful.  I generally like the goat cheese pear flatbread but last time I had it a this location is was lacking flavour, so this time I opted for the skinny-licious turkey sandwich. I believe the menu said it was oven roast turkey breast, so I expected hot but it was just cold turkey meat. The bun was delicious.  FYI - my SO is looking over my shoulder and does not agree with my 3 star rating. He says his chicken is 4 stars. He can write his own review",

    "text": "When in Rome do as the Roman's do. A popular thing to do in this Roman themed mall is to visit the Cheesecake Factory. At the Forum Shops, all roads lead to the Cheesecake Factory located where the main corridor concludes at the Journey to Atlantis Show.      It seems that the time I initially started visiting this Cheesecake Factory is older than the statues and columns that border this Roman themed mall. In a sense this is partially True considering that my visits go back long ago prior to the Forum Shops expansion when Virgin Records was the cool place to visit during the George W. Bush administration. Today, at the end of the Obama administration, the food and dining experience here is just as good as when George W. Bush was in office.      This Cheesecake Factory is usually busy. There is quite a difference waiting here than an uninteresting  place such as the DMV. Here, patrons wait in an area with the sounds and sights of Rome. Where else can you wait for dinner while watching statues above a 50,000 gallon aquarium come to life to battle it out in the \"Fall of Atlantis\"? Waiting gets even better with the signature cheesecake displays at the other side of the hostess. Waiting would be even better if there was no waiting. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to offer the texting or beeper system.      The Cheesecake Factory is a spacious and attractive restaurant that includes tables overlooking the \"Fall of Atlantis\" show. The tables deep inside the restaurant are envoloped in an elegant interior. On the majority of my visits including the latest, we sat deep in the restaurant.      The Cheesecake menu is to restaurants what the nearby 50,000 gallon aquarium is to aquariums: Giantic! As soon as I saw eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta, on this visit I instantaneously bypassed around 250 other choices. Eggplant parmesan is one of my favorite dishes. I was so :-) to see it on the menu. With that said, in the past I have enjoyed commendable sandwiches including the eggplant parmesan sandwich, burgers, and a BLT. The eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta is reasonably priced at $14.95. Unlike some restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip, this is not a tourist trap. With the entree, I ordered bottomless Coke. Ahead of the dinner, the attentive waiter served us bread with butter.    The eggplant parmesan was delicious with a capital D. The Cheesecake Factory style of serving eggplant parmesan is separate round pieces bordering pesto pasta. Every bite of the eggplant parmesan covered with mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, and marina cheese made me feel like a Roman emperor. Likewise I relished the taste of the pesto pasta. This is the first time that a restaurant served eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta. Cheesecake Factory had broke the tradition of serving eggplant parmesan with pasta under marinara sauce. Regardless, I truly enjoyed it. The dinner was so enjoyable that time went fast, and before you knew it we were leaving Rome for the Las Vegas Strip. It's just a shame that I never leave enough room for the cheesecake.     I have been a fan of this Cheesecake Factory going back years prior to holding a smartphone when Virgin Records was the attraction. This dining environment inside a faux Ancient Rome overlooking a 50,000 gallon aquarium where statues come to life to battle it out in the \"Fall of Atlantis\" show is exclusive. The generous menu offers several choices from the cheeseburger to eggplant parmesan. The prices are reasonable. And the service has always been solid. In conclusion, Julius Caesar would be proud of the Forum Shops Cheesecake Factory.",

To start off with the Hostess was rude, and instead of waiting an hour,  we waited 1 hour 45 minutes to be seated. So we get upstairs, we have to wait another 5 min to be seated. We sit down and it takes the unhappy, uncaring, feminine waiter, about 10 minutes to acknowledge us, and another 10 minutes to bring our drinks, no alcohol, just water and soda. I was looking at the other waiter and he was fast with his customers.  We order our food...  45 minutes later they bring everyone their food,  15 minutes later they bring my chicken wings and cold fries.  During the long wait,  I filled up on delicious bread, that was the only good thing.   My aunt and uncle had cold, hard, white rice with their meal. The manager said he would give us all free cheesecake for our bad experience, wrong! Only 2 of us got it,  and my cheesecake tasted dry, and the whip cream on top was hard!   Never again, Austin and Las Vegas Cheesecake Factory just isn't good!",

I had never been before at any other location, and i was mesmerized by the size of the menu and how many calories each dish contained. Eff it, I was on vacation.  The lady and I started with toasted avocado bread, which is what it sounds like: toasted bread topped with avocada. It was actually pretty good, and is a good hangover cure if you're not feeling too hot.  For our lunches we each ordered salads. It was called the chicken avocada salad or something similar, and it was a LARGE salad. One of the biggest i have eaten in my life, actually. It was covered in guac, chicken, black beans, tortilla strips, corn... just a lot of stuff packed in, and I could barely even finish it. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita. Recommended.  Service was good, Our waiter enjoyed talking to us about where we were from and what we had planned while in Vegas. If you're in the area or walking around Caesar's and want some grub or booze, this is a solid option.",

Otherwise the staff is nice, environment is pretty good.  Was gonna give it a 3 Star, but I thought it would have been harsh just because I do not think their cheesecake taste that good.",

Seating was intimate and I appreciate y server placing me at a table for two and not a table for four with two empty seats. That's a plus! Appetizers, entree, and desserts all came out with time to enjoy each course. The price isn't as expensive as my friends have been saying. It's decent and the refills keep coming for drinks. My server was really nice and speedy! I love the atmosphere in this restaurant!! Relaxing!  Pros: Decent price, food chain, delicious food, great service, intimate setting, appealing decor  Cons: A little crowded, dark lighting, no music, no wifi, no apple pay that I could see  Overall: I'll be back very soon! Keep up the great work guys! I'm satisfied and happy!",

Our bill came to a total of $163.46  We wanted to pay with the 100 dollar gift card and the 63 dollars with our debit card. But the next day we realized they had charged our debit card the total $163.46 AND kept our 100 dollar gift card as well!!  The next day we spoke to a manger by the name of Melanie who told us she would mail a new gift card. A WEEK later we went back because no gift card had arrived and spoke to Joel, left our contact information and he said he would get back to us within 24 hours.  It is now FEBRUARY 26th and I haven't heard from anyone! We are so frustrated and aren't receiving much cooperation or empathy. So diapo  *UPDATE* I emailed customer service like I was asked to in the reply from Cheesecake Factory to my original review. It is now Wednesday MARCH 21st and I have yet to hear anything back??

    "text": "It's a Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain. It's over-priced. But it sure is tasty. And there are so many food, drink, and dessert options. I can dine forever on just appetizers here.  This particular location is nestled in the Caesar's Forum Shops. It's rarely too crazy busy where there's a wait. I prefer dining on the faux \"patio\" so I can people watch the mall. And you can sorta see, albeit mostly hear, the free show thingy that happens at the fountain / fish tank out front of this location.  Service was decent. A bit scattered. But attentive and friendly enough.  On my visit here, they were out of buffalo blasts. Which was incredibly sad as those are the absolute most greatest thing ever at Cheesecake Factory. In fact, they are the best take on buffalo wings my taste buds have had the pleasure of enjoying.  But it wasn't a total dismal thing as there was a new (at least to me) menu item - buffalo chicken meatballs. They were just like the buffalo blasts, but in meatball form. Extremely tasty.  The mac 'n' cheese bites were also a hit. The Cheesecake Factory really does do this trendy appetizer better than most.  All the other appetizers we sampled were tasty too, but less memorable and crave-worthy.  All in all, there are far better, more unique, Vegas-specific places to throw down your money for good eats. But when you need to please a crowd, have a specific craving, everywhere else is full, and/or you just need to get off your feet and eat right now and you're right by here... It's better than most other chains and it's got decent people watching.",

We waited more than one hour for our food, and the food is quite simple. The restaurant was also not very busy. We had a burrito, a salad, lettuce wrap tacos, and a cheese only omelette. Normally this would be served up in 25 to 35 minutes.  When the food get arrived, we pointed out to the waitress that one of the classes was horribly dirty, with a big brown ring around the inside of it. She wished it away, and laughed about it. Later, she returned again laughing, and said, don't worry about it, it was only a bad stain and not scum on the inside of the glass.  Overall, a great disappointment and we will definitely not be returning to this particular location. It was not at all up to the standards of what I have come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory, which isn't all that exciting anyway.",

Very friendly, engaging with all the customers, but left me and kept making sure that my drinks were filled until I was ready to leave. Then once I was ready, checked me out got me on my way. Even took enough time to notice my name when I paid (with my credit card), and thanked me for coming in my name. Of course I didn't have catch his but great bartender!",

We chose the interior dining area this time and immersed ourselves in the lunch selections. MAN, this place has it all. HUGE menu. How do they do it all so well? For $11.50 I chose a pasta special - spicy chipotle chicken. It was really good although the chicken was quite dry. I wish they would carry a lunch special with shrimp in it! The sauce was just enough and although it claims to be spicy, it is not so to people like me! Our waiter was professional, pleasant and down-to-earth.  Very casual dining here. My biggest complaint was the music playing. Awful, back to the era of Huckleberry Finn.",

It was too loud in the area to be able to hear him unless he leans over and speaks up.. Perhaps it's just me and my hearing? *shrug* I didn't have a big appetite that night. Just ordered something off their \"skinny menu\" ones with smaller portions and \"lower\" calories. Had the Ahi Tartare and the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps. Both was enjoyable and was filling, for me.  All in all, very affordable, great for a date or with a large party. You have the option to sit inside or \"outside\".  The restroom is upstairs on the second floor. Kind of a little journey just to wash your hands!",

We particularly liked the nachos--they were crisp enough, well salted, and huge in size! Prices are reasonable too. We loved the attentive service also.

I think this is at least my 30th time at cheese cake factory, it just always ends up being the go to place for food for the people in my life.   I ordered the 4 cheese pasta and man was it gear. Very cheesy and very rich in flavor. I believe it was topped with ricotta and mixing that in with everything made the texture especially delicious.   Also had the margarita pizza. The thing about that pizza is it's not too heavy or greasy. The sauce is where it's at and its not a splatter of tomato sauce. It's smooth and hits the spot. Definitely a step up from cheese pizza, there isn't much of a difference anyway so I would say to just go for the margarita.   I ate an ahi appetizer, forgot what it's called but it was delicious... Except it was a tad bit expensive for the amount I got. I was expecting bigger chunks of ahi but I understand that ahi is an expensive fish. I have yet to really understand the world of expensive food but I am getting there.   Also the bread. Gotta love a place the gives out free bread.   Overall, great place. They have tons of options, so it can get overwhelming, but that's why I recommend trying new things! Just go for it!",

I may be bias because I'm a local to Summerlin Las Vegas, but this location lacks \"great service\" the food is sub par, and food wait times are extremely long . Like I said I live in Summerlin and the Boca Park location has exceptional service, the food quality is much higher and the time it takes to receive your food is shorter. Each time dinning here it's been an extremely long time before our food came. If you're a local definitely avoid this location at all cost, I suppose it's convenient for tourist.",

We made the trip over there, speak to the host and ask to put our name down for 2 people.  He gives us a look and a groan, so my response was \"what, the wait is now up to 2 hours?\"  His reply was \"Actually it's odd, I can seat you immediately right now.\"  WHAT!  Score!  We were seated in literally 4 minutes.  This must have been a rare case, because we ended up being seated still in close proximity to the host platform and all the rest of parties of 2 coming in after us were all being told an hour wait and to take their name down.  I guess we were just lucky. All of the food was amazing, we had burgers and mac and cheese balls.  So good.  We ended up taking a few slices of cheesecake to go because he had a fridge in our hotel room.  The lemon meringue one was awesome! We had a great experience!",

Yet despite the many mishaps that happened during our meal, our waiter and the manager provided the best service possible and were very apologetic. They redid both our dishes wonderfully and served as a new basket of bread. We even ended up getting the entire meal for free since the manager felt so bad for all the things that went wrong. 4 stars for the second batch of food and service! We will definitely be coming back during our next trip. :)",

Long story short, there was no table for us when we got there, which is fine, but the hostess was so rude and said it will be an hour and forty five min., she said there was only one table that would fit that many people, we asked if they could push a few tables outside together and she said no.  My coworker got a little upset and asked to talk o the manager, come to find out the wait was not going to be even close to that long and they would push two tables together for us.  So the 1 and 45 min wait time suddenly was only 15 min!!!  Our waitress was great, very sweet and nice.

Not only you get an amazing choice of cheesecakes (and cakes in general) which are just delicious... but also the food is great! I've tried the Smokehouse BBQ Burger twice and I have to admit it was one of the best I've ever had and better than the one I had at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR the day before.  Definitely recommended (it's also non-expensive), but remember to show up early (or late) for dinner as the place is always packed!",

I have to say not like the ones in LA, but was good really.   Fried Shrimp platter: Mediocre in my opinion. I was expecting something much better than what it came that night to me!   Chicken Cajun: Much better than the Shrimp's, but also less than the expectations.   In all with the service and the design, it deserve 4 stars without hesitation.",

We saw Cheesecake Factory and that seemed to fit the bill!  The Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain and so  you probably either love it or hate it.  In my opinion, the cheesecake is top notch!  Their cheesecakes are rich and served in huge slices that will satisfy any sweet tooth.  However, since I was jonesing for a Fro Ho at Serendipity later, I skipped it this trip.  As for the food, well, it is what it is.  The menu is HUGE (if you haven't been there it is a spiral bound book!).  That is great for variety, but other than the cheesecake they haven't perfected anything.    This time out I had the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich with Hashbrowns.  It was good, not great.  They put tomatoes on the sandwich before they heat it so they get mushy.  Bleck!  The bread is good and the flavors work.    We had good service and they sat us on the second floor which was nice since it cut down on the noise.    Good lunch, nice easy stop in the Forum Shops.",

We had ordered our food and waited another 30 mins and proceeded to speak with a manager. The manager then switched our server to prevent any more mis communication.  Our food came and one of our dishes did not arrive (5-10mins later).  The dressing for one of our salads also did not arrive.  We were then presented with our new server whom took care of us. The manager did not seem very sympathic to us as she was just doing what she thought was good and did not go above and beyond.

Shrimps are big and fresh, properly cooked, but besides shrimp, there's only tomato and red pepper in the pasta.

The service was great, Julia went above and beyond to make sure my friend and I had everything we needed.

Prices seem better than other places on the strip- if you are hungry & want food you can count on at a fair price this is a good choice.

I had the chicken piccata, which wasn't the best I ever had but it was fairly good. They gave me an absolute ton of food, which I could not finish. My boyfriend had the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce, which he enjoyed. For the two of us (2 entrees, 1 cocktail, 1 soda, 1 appetizer), it came to $47 with tax, I believe. Not half bad.

My boyrfriend and I decided to share the factory combo of herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi.  The salmon  was horribly undercooked in the middle!  I told the waiter and he tried to tell me that it wasn't and that if I wanted I could get another cooked piece.  At this point I was disgusted and wanted to order something else on the menu.  The waiter then came back and jokingly said okay you only have to pay half price for the combo since we only got half a meal :/ He then said he convinced the managers to comp. the meal.  I got my second plate of food which was also not very good.  Disgusted and disappointed I decided that we were just going to order our desert and get the check.  The combo had been comped as promise and we paid our bill.  Whatever change was left, we gave to the waiter.  As we were gathering our things he had the audacity to complain to us about his tip and said that he got us a free meal and spouted off some more bs as he walked away.  Never in my life have I had this happen to me.  We tipped the appropriate percent and he felt it wasn't enough and came to us, the patrons, and complained about something he should be grateful to receive.  This was TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  I then told the managers and they were outraged.  They told me that it was the waiters idea to only deduct half for the combo plate and theirs to comp the whole thing.  Not only was this waiter, named REX (?), rude and out of line, he was a LIAR.  The manager there was very apologetic and proceeded to the bakery to give me my choice of deserts.  This however, does not change the fact that we had a horrible, bland, undercooked meal and were treated like scum by their greedy rude waiter.  My friend from out of town never wants to eat at a Cheesecake Factory when she comes to Las Vegas ever again.  I should note that the lunch specials are pretty good when I go here to eat during work.  Tonight was the worst and is going to turn me away.",

    "text": "I wish I knew about this website a few months ago.   My family and I had great experience at other cheesecake factory. This location was a total upset. We made reservation ahead of time for twelve people and the staff rest assured that they can accomodate that much.  Our reservation was supposed to be at 6:00 pm, but we weren't seated until 7:00 p.m. At this point, the men in the family were all upset, but still had to go in, for the sake of the ladies. So we followed the staff to an area, but only to find out that they didn't have our table ready. We were told that we will be scattered or to be sitted in different tables...even though we had a party of twelve. By this time, I was really angry. I wasn't able to hold myself in, I freaked out. They were supposed to find a way to meet our needs. Like they say, customers are always right. But the unorganized staff didn't deliver at all. Everyone in my family were upset because of what was going on and we were suppose to have a great time since it was my daughter's birthday. Anyway, as mentioned the staff were just horrible. We didn't get our drinks in a five minute time frame, but instead longer. It took us even longer to order and to get our food. The most irritating part, they messed up on some of the orders and didn't even apologize. Since I am very carefree, I asked one of the staff for the manager. I told the manager that we weren't happy and that, he had the worst staff any person can imagine.Out of all the cheesecake factory (at the ceasar's forum) staff, the manager, I believe was, the only one who was decent to actually care about his job and the reputation of the restaurant.   Skip this place when you are in Las Vegas. The worst restaurant ever. I would rate this place half a star.",

This also happens to be my favorite Cheesecake Factory location to date, but it is also the busiest location I`ve been to. Thankfully the giant fish tank located right in front of the restaurant is a great source of distraction, especially if you have kids.  Quick and friendly service, great family environment.",

    "text": "If I could give this business a zero star rating I definitely would. I got food poisoning from this restaurant when on my lunch break (I work in the forum shops). I ordered salmon and hadn't eaten anything else all day and felt violently sick immediately after. I wrote to the corporate offices online simply to notify them of the incident so that it didn't happen to someone else, I wasn't looking for something free since I don't plan on eating here again.. And they replied with a few questions about how I paid, what I ordered and the date and time which I gladly answered. About a week later I got a letter from them saying that their temperature and refrigeration was up to par and that they won't reimburse me for my meal. Great customer service Cheesecake Factory. Pretty much telling me.. \"Nope you didn't get sick from our food. Have a nice day.\" It's not even about the food, now it's just horrible customer service.",

    "text": "I should preface this my saying I am not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory - I usually find the food unimpressive and pretty bland... and the wait for a table is just insane.  We were here on a Saturday at lunchtime and did not have to wait for a table - yay!  However, beware of the \"outdoor\" seating, which is a patio within the mall.  There is a show right there every hour that is incredibly loud and if you sit out there, you will not be able to carry on a conversation.  Sitting inside the restaurant is far better.  The waitress was very good and attentive and I actually really liked the appetizer (cheddar cheese dip with tortilla chips) but I was very very hungry.  However, the main dish was not so good.  I got the portobello mushroom sandwich with fries.  The fries were actually really good but the mushroom was so greasy that I could not eat it.  Maybe next time I will just stick with the appetizers.",

    "text": "The two stars are for our server only. He was incredible and really went out of his way to help make sure the dining experience was not a total loss.  However, the food was just plain dissapointing.  My mom ordered a pear and walnut salad with bleu cheese.  It came out with some cheese that did not taste like bleu, about 5 walnuts, and no pears.  So when we asked the waiter for some pears, he apologized and went to get a manager.  About 10 minutes later another waiter plopped down a small dish of cut pairs on it and left without another word.  The pears were dry, all 3 of them.  The rest of us all had hamburgers, and while the meat and toppings were good, the buns were soggy.  I know I shouldn't expect much from here for the food, I mean we all come here really for the cheesecake, but if a restaurant is going to have such an extensive menu, the food should at least be palatable and decent.",

Seriously I have yet to ever try something bad at this place, so reliable for a large portion of some great food and this one in Caesars is no different.  Went here after a long night in Vegas, we all woke up around 2pm and walked (or stumbled) over to cheesecake factory and began chowing down on the bread.  Once we got the bread in us we immediately order bloody mary's to get us back on track for the vegas life.  Our food came and I always stick with the Crispy Chicken Costeletta, try it, it is absolutely amazing.  All in all this meal brought us somewhat back to reality and our waitress was awesome, she would come over and joke around with us as we began ordering more drinks and getting our smiles painted back on.  For a great meal at a great price go to this place and you will not be let down....",
