    "text": "When my husband and I walked through the door, I fell in love right away. I love how open the place looked it was a total surprise because I didn't expect it took look like that. We were initially sit at the bar but it seemed a bit crowded to us. But I was looking at their bar and they have a very nice selection of liquor.  When we got sat at our table I was a little disappointed the the tables were wobbly... That is one of my pet peeves when I go out to eat. Nothing is more annoying than trying to eat your meal on a wobbly table. (But I guess its just me being in the industry as well... )  Kelvin was our server and he was so sweet. We started of with the Nem Nuong Rolls which were DELICIOUS. I've had it at other places before but I liked the ones here A LOT. The Nem Noung meat was warm where most places don't really serve it that way. And the herbs and veggies that they put into the roll just complement everything so well. I love the red shiso leaf in there- it just adds a brightness to the roll. But make sure you order these, because the table behind us had ordered some and we ordered the last order... SOOOO they sell QUICK! I had also ordered the fish cake with were delicious as well.The texture was nice and the flavors weren't to over powering. And I also liked the fact that they served it with a side of lettuce and pickled veggies to eat it as a wrap.  The chef had also sent out some Eggrolls as well some specialty dish. I really wish I had asked what it was because they were both awesome. The specialty dish had some shrimp, pork and pickled veggies all served on a shrimp chip. Very nice and scrumptious. The eggrolls came out super hot, (Just like I like them) and they were served with a side of veggies as well. (I Love when they do that) And their dipping sauce was on point. Not too garlicky, not too salty, with right amount of sweetness as well. Yum!  We both Ordered the house special, and I had ordered mine with the Additional Bone Marrow and Scallion Oil because it intrigued me. When it came out, it was nice and hot. (You'll be surprised how many times we've had pho that just came out warm.) So that was super awesome. And they had put the Bone Marrow and Scallion Oil on the side. I like to taste my pho first before i add any additional seasoning and it was PERFECT. Nice balance of flavor, not too salty, not too sweet. The cuts of meat that they used in there were super delicious as well. And their CILANTRO... My husband thought I was a little crazy, But the Cilantro that they used was sooooooooooooooooooooooo good, I've never had cilantro that tasted like that before, it was so good. (I wonder where they get their cilantro from.)  All in all, I would most definitely be back, It may be a little bit pricier than your average bowl of Pho, BUT you can tell that they use the best quality ingredients and that there is love in the food Something a lot of places lack now a days. And service was great as well so that made our meal even better.",

I ordered Traditional Spring Rolls and a Pho-dipped Banh Mi, and was not disappointed by anything. The spring rolls were fresh and delicious, and the braised pork in the banh mi was insanely good, perfect crunch on the bread, as well as some spectacular fillings and a beautiful savory broth.  Is the menu overflowing like some of the Spring Mountain joints? Of course not. This is a restaurant that you can tell wants to focus on perfecting the things it does, not trying to do all the things half assed.  One more note: The absolute best service. In the world. That is not hyperbole.  Enjoy, DTLV.",

Servers not attentive or friendly.  Had such high expectations but I'd say skip this and go to their sister restaurant around the corner.",

It's one of the first floor businesses on the loft complex. Grab streetside parking for free on Saturdays and Sundays. Watch out for one way streets while navigating. It's best to approach away from Las Vegas Blvd.   This feels like a chain as it is extremely polished from the styling of the decor and menu. The decor was more contemporary American than Vietnamese but the touch of a green color scheme and plants made it feel like Vietnam, otherwise it's a slightly industrial American look.   The pho tasted exceptionally fresh and flavorful as it was served in a steel bowl. I had the special combination and all the proteins were delicious and satisfying. The meatballs were especially buttery. I felt as if the surroundings made the food taste better. The pho rolls with minced meat, grilled onions, and rice paper were unique and savory. Long story short - the food was phenomenal.   The waitstaff were attentive and friendly. The view of downtown was nice too. We will definitely be coming back!",

Ordered the Le Pho rolls to start, shared the House Special pho and Vietnamese Poached Chicken Salad. No effort was made to course dishes: my guy's soup came out before anything else, followed by our app, and my salad trailed along a little after. We were one of two tables. Our server overall was impersonal and disinterested.   Pho was decent- broth was not quite as developed as I'd like, but portion was on par with average.  Namesake rolls were the favorite dish- popped with flavor, thanks to the garlic garnish, something I'd order again. Salad section seems to be on the menu to cater the healthy crowd but arrives looking like a plate of garnishes and no effort. Chicken was dry, portion was small, flavor lacking overall.   TIP: Maybe also avoid the sandwich section of menu- a friend warned me the $10 bahn mi, even factoring the lack of competition, isn't worth even half the price.",

I've tried the ox tail pho, pork chops with rice and their bbq plate. All are amazing! The have a full bar as well and they offer Moscow mules too! The wait is never long and your food comes quickly if your strapped for time.",

The restaurant is near the state courthouse and in walking distance of the Fremont Street Experience (if you don't mind walking). It's on the corner of Bonneville, in a decent area of downtown. The food is decent. It is not \"blow you away\" good. But it is decent, filling, and fairly-priced, for downtown. Is this going to be the best pho you ever had in your life, if you are a fan? NO. But it won't be your worst, either. The service is knowledgeable and mostly pleasant. A good lunch.",

    "text": "I have been here a few time and ad several different dishes and it was long overdue to review Le Pho. Located downtown just north of the Arts District, Le Pho is a place I enjoy when in the area. I was a fan of his families restaurant in China Town so I knew I had to come here. I could enjoy any one of their appetizers or just order several and call it a meal but I stick to one appetizer and either get the Pho or the vermicelli bowl. -The oxtail Pho is my go to. Several chunks of oxtail still on the bone it melts in your mouth and is worth getting a little messy eating it right from the bone. Just enough of noodles and broth this is a perfect dish for me when I am sick or just need to warm up. -Vermicelli bowl with grilled pork. Grilled pork, lettuce, bean sprouts and mint on a bed of vermicelli noodles, Topped with roasted peanuts, I like to order extra pork and add the egg rolls. This is a very fulfilling dish. I like to find a reason to go downtown just so I can come here to eat. I will be back soon, very soon!!",

Bartender attended me, got me a glass of water and gave me menu to look at.  He came back in about 10 min, took my order.   I asked him for wi-fi password. Because,,,lunch by myself? What else is there to do? He told me it'll be on the bill and he'll bring it to me (didn't say when).  So I'm thinking to myself,,,I kind of want it now,,,when am I going to get it? how hard is it to verbally tell me the password? Or post it somewhere for everyone?  Sure enough, he forgot about my bill, and I didn't get it until I finish my food. He apologized, for your note. I wouldn't say I'm mad, but it just doesn't make sense. If you are not about to let your guest enjoy free wi-fi, why would you even set up guest wifi???  Overall, first time and this time, their customer service just lacks. They are just \"not rude\", or \"okay\". Definitely could use more smile, and enthusiasm.  Their pho, is pretty solid. One of my favorite in Vegas.",

If you look closely though, certain individual elements clash with each other but as a whole it seems to work.  The menu seems pretty standard for a modern Vietnamese place. We usually just get the special pho. I like that you can have additional toppings like herby oils and whatnot.  My indicator of good pho is this: after the meal, do you and your clothes smell like pho? In this case no. There pho here is a little more nuanced, a little more refined. Not saying it's good, not saying it's bad. Just ok.  Service is good during lunchtime. We usually get this one kid who always checks with the kitchen if this or that contains wheat flour, soy sauce or hoisin (gluten allergy).",

Had to cancel one of the orders mid-way & the bartender hustled back to do it.  -The spring rolls were good, but not the authentic Vietnamese variety you would expect, more show than taste. -Also, glad they had Sculpin Grapefruit IPA on tap.

The busser who took a our drink order was very friendly, and that's where it stops.   Our server was rude and short with us.   We ordered two Bahn Mi and the Chow Fun with chicken. Then, once our food arrived (but before tasting it) we ordered a third Bahn Mi.    As soon as we got it my friend bit into the Bahn Mi and was literally unable to bite through the meat.  I thought she was being a drama queen (she's weird about meat) but she wasn't.  I, also, couldn't bite through the meat.  At this point we tell the server that the meat is REALLY tough / pure grizzle and we can't bite through it.  Not only did she seem uninterested, she didn't offer any solution.  My coworker literally took all of the meat off the sandwich and ate it like that.  I got through less than half of my sandwich before giving up... and I can eat.    We asked if it was too late to cancel the third Bahn Mi because we didn't want to torture our coworker, and again she was quite rude, she even said \"probably\" when we asked if it was too late to cancel as we didn't eat any of our own.   We tried the Chow Fun.  My coworker spit hers into her napkin which wasn't a good sign.   I tried a bite and it tasted like soy sauce and boiled chicken water.  Again we ask our server \"is there perhaps a new cook or something because this doesn't taste right\", but she just said \"no, it should be correct\".    We've eaten here before and we've had BOTH of these dishes before and they were good in the past.  But this terrible service combined with terrible food and no offer of a solution has me questioning whether I will ever go back again.",

Close to our house we come here quite often.   We always order either jasmine or pomegranate rooibos hot tea.   Our app is always the vegan roll a soft hand roll filled with shiitake, radish, asparagus and other yummy veggies, including Thai basil. They come with a large dish of hoisin/peanut sauce.   My better half always orders vegan Pho. Amazing broth full of flavor and A TON of noodles. Exactly how we love it. It has red onion, scallion, fresh zucchini, and sprouts on the side. I always take all the Thai basil, lime slices and fresh jalapeno off the side topping plate. :D Hubs likes it without.   Sometimes instead of Pho I order the vermicelli bowl and ask for it vegan. They pile it high with tons of fresh veggies and if I like they add crispy tofu or sauteed tofu. Its fine without it!   Please check out the photos I have posted, their beautiful food will fill you up and keep you happy and healthy!   They have tricking operating hours, check before you decide to come!",

The restaurant looks nice and clean, which is not something you always get at other Vietnamese restaurants... the menu is pretty simple, and of course I had to order the house special pho to see if it's any good.   The food portion is generous and overall taste good, nothing too special tho. So, I have to say for a bowl of pho, $12 is a little overpriced since I can get the same thing (or better tasting ones) at many other places.  Good to try.",

The signature appetizer ( called Le pho) was excellent and I could have easily made a couple of these my main course (5 to an order) but my oxtail fried rice was also very good. Everyone else either had oxtail or combination pho and everyone was also happy with their choice. You will need to plan for desert elsewhere as they only offer a coconut and you dig the meat out yourself after enjoying the coconut milk. We passed.  All and all, I give it 5 stars for great food and being an independent, small business putting out good food.",

Another con was that without siracha it had zero flavor or spice. Been to a lot of pho places and I was higher hopes for this one since pho is in the name of the restaurant.

I tried to sub beef on the salad and they said no so I had to get pork instead. The salad was for my assistant who is newly diagnosed as having celiacs. I told the girl on the phone...not sure she believed me. Sorry...not just the gf trend here. Some ppl actually can't eat wheat. Anyways, the salad made her sick. Obviously not gf.  I ordered the vegan pho & spring rolls. She asked how many spring rolls so I thought they were a la carte. They're not. I ended up with 6 orders of spring rolls (was ordering for the office.) WTF. At least they'll keep in the fridge....I guess. For future reference, they're 2 per order.  The vegan pho was underwhelming to say the least. The veggies were over cooked & mushy & flavorless. The broth was ok, but mostly just salty. The noodles were weird...not normal pho noodles. They almost looked like ramen. It gave me a tummy ache.  Overall I can't recommend the food. Also the pho in Chinatown is 100x better.",

    "text": "I have to give my experience here a 3. My mother and I are Celiac and had been assured by our friends at Le Thai and Bocho that Le Pho would have something for us. They were not wrong, although the staff had next to no clue what we were talking about when we said gluten free (we were offered vegan and peanut free things, neither of which were gf).   The decor is beautiful and the restaurant was clean and open. Not too busy.   We ordered the beef pho which we split. It was quite delicious. The broth was nicely seasoned, and the noodles and meat were very well cooked. Nice ceramic bowl, and stayed warm throughout the meal.   We also ordered the traditional Spring Roll after being assured it was normally gluten free (it is not). We were served the roll and my mom took a bit of a huge piece of wonton in the middle. Wonton is usually made from wheat flour, but after we asked the waiter (who was friendly and patient) she told us the chef said it was rice flour. Ok fine.  Except literally 30 seconds later another waiter came running out to tell us it was not gluten free, and my mom already ate some. So she is going to be sick later. The chef remade them without the wonton, and they tasted quite good (although personally I am not fond of raw mint). The peanut sauce was great.   Also had the Hennessy cocktail on their menu (the name escapes me). For the amount of drink vs ice (it's mostly ice) I would say it's a bit overpriced, but quite delicious, and beautifully presented. Beware of the stir stick with the cherry. I got a splinter in my lip trying to get it off of there (I blame my dumb luck).   So essentially I wouldn't go back unless the staff gets some allergy training. Gluten intolerance/allergies are fairly common knowledge now, and I think they should know what gluten free means.   It's too bad because the pho was really, really good...  Update: both Mom and I got quite ill after eating here. Celiacs I do not suggest this place.",

Okay, I knew it wasn't your $8.95 pho like in Rowland Heights but then again that's if you can find parking after going through all the damn traffic.  No parking problem here and not in Spring Mtn Rd but hey, It's Asian Fusion Pho so we go with the flow. I had the Rib Eye Pho yes, I'm a Rib-Eye Steak person and never saw this ever.  It was the bomb!!!! The soup itself is fusion for sure but it was hella excellent.  The Rib eye cut I would believe in was prime and not choice cut.  Don't know if I'll ever have beef pho again unless it was rib-eye steak. Also it was served on metal soup bowls and that's an excellent concept as pho needs to stay on the warm to hot side to really enjoy the meal.  The metal soup bowl is one way.  This tells me they understand the whole pho experience.  Many pho places just slammed it in and whatever.   Yes, there's a whole technical approach to preparing, cooking and eating pho.  Le Pho has the formula for sure. As Arnold would say, \"I'll be back\". You venture out and you will find.",

Though portion sizes of the 2 things I ordered could have been bigger, I wasn't complaining because I was genuinely full and content with my choices.  The thick pork was marinated in a very thick sauce and with the addition of some sriracha, the appetizer was great. The veggie spring rolls were authentic and came with a delicious peanut dipping sauce that could be bottled it was so good.  Then the drinks during HH, 2 for 1 for a few beers and a house red and white, were good and well poured.  With many options on the menu to try, HH everyday (even weekends), and TVs and a good bar menu to choose from to watch a game after work, I will surely be back.  The only complaint would be the small HH food menu.  All they had was chicken wings, pork, and $1 oysters. All great options and rightly discounted, but hopefully more is added to the menu in the future.",

If there are rules to the offers in which these are clearly stated on the offer, I am more than happy to comply). Jasmine  said it was a dine in only offer (no where on the yelp check-in does it state this), I told her that it was for a previous dine-in that was 2 weeks ago (she asked me for my done in receipt from weeks ago. Who holds on to two week old lunch receipts - she claimed she did and that she wrote every meal off and that she's entitled to at least that). Omg, I honestly cannot believe what I experienced. Broke my heart because their green tea Thai is really good - except today, she added too much ice, too much half & half... just awful. Hope this helps anyone.

My friend ordered the same thing and his wife ordered the vegetable one.  It was acually really good!  there was a lot of flavors.  I was given jalapenos, basil, bean sprouts to add in and it was great.  The price too was awesome!

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 56/100  After dropping off donations at Las Vegas Rescue Mission we were hungry so we decided to check this place out. It's located at the bottom floor of The Juhl condominiums. If you don't know the area you'll probably miss it and have to circle back around, like we did.   Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley, this one is modern and pricier. The only one in downtown, the vibe and pricing caters to the downtown area.   I loved the interior design and spacious feel. There's a full bar and happy hour options as well, which other Viet spots don't have. I looked them up on instagram and they host private events and events for local charities which is awesome.   Looking at the menu, I had no idea what to order. I didn't want Pho, and I wanted to try something new, I asked the waitress and one of her suggestions was the Pho Dipped. I decided to try that. My friend got that as well.   Pho Dipped $12 - Bahn Mi with a side of pho broth.   For the taste, size and price it was just OK. It wasn't salty, which I liked.The flavors were mediocre, nothing bad, but nothing great to make up for pricing. This was not worth the price.  I had never seen a Green Thai Tea before, so I really wanted to try it. It was buy one get one free with yelp check in offer. Offer shows \"1 Free Green Thai Iced Tea\", we didn't see the fine print. Price is $5 each. Small size. Thought that was pricey as well.   I guess you pay for the ambiance here.   Our first waitress was okay, felt a little rushed. While we were eating, her shift was ending so another waitress took over. The second waitress was friendlier, more helpful and knew what she was doing, like she's been doing this for years or owned the place. I only ate a half of the bahn mi. She offered durable takeout containers. Didn't expect a container for the broth, which was nice. She also offered to split the bill for us without us asking. With tax and tip we each paid about $17. That is pricey for what we got.   I would come here again to try the happy hour and if I'm in the area, but won't order the Pho Dipped. Other than that I'd rather go some where else.",

First,  I'm not a fan of Vietnamese food and do not like Pho. But this place is a bar and I've eaten other menu items. The items I've eaten were good, if a little expensive. However price is a product of the location. My best description of staff and the way that I've been treated is \"pretentious\". And I don't know why they behave that way. A bar should be welcoming. I make more then all of them and tip well. Perhaps I'm just not the hipster they want to frequent the place. Guess what? Hipsters don't have money! I just ordered food,  a simple sandwich to go 40 minutes ago. The staff out numbered patrons 2 to 1. The bartender took my order. $12 and change. I paid, tipped him $5 plus the change and went back to my office. 20 min later I returned and food not ready. I waited another 10 minutes and left.  Let's go see if they have my food now.  1 star.

Usually it is a wrap style that sometimes it s a hassle to put everything together lol. Very smart idea.  Service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and very welcome to any questions. We ordered a chicken Pho to share, and she kindly split it for us too.   If you are looking for a great place to hang out, this is a good option especially it is not located in a busy area.",

I normally share a pho - house special with beef broth is very flavorful. The vegetarian pho with vegan broth also has a pretty good flavor broth if that's your thing, but if you're just in the mood for veggies but not a vegetarian, I'd recommend the vegetable pho with beef broth. The veggies take to the richer broth flavor well, plus protein! Definitely recommend the Le Pho and Traditional rolls, I'd go there for rolls and another app too. I also enjoyed the House banh mi, the baguette is good and crunchy and there's a good amount of filling. Only thing I wasn't super into was the Nem Nuoug (pork meatballs). The meatballs themselves were good but they are drowned out by the lettuce and vermicelli when eaten altogether.",

Also, for $15 a bowl, they use dried shiitake mushroom. I mean, it's not like you can't use dried shiitake, but if you do it, do it right. They still got that funky dehydrated taste in them.   Don't live in the area, but if I come to downtown, I'll definitely try the bahn mi again",

Instead of getting the sauce on the side, it was already poured on the vermicelli so, it settled at the bottom of the bowl. 3/5  Pho Dipped: Banh mi with a side of pho broth to dip your sandwich in. It comes with a side of potato chips. 3/5  These are dishes I've seen at other Vietnamese restaurants and Buddha Belly for half the price. You're paying for the location. The food was just ok.",

    "text": "Food: 6/10 Service:4/10 Price:5/10  I had really wanted to like Le Pho more, having been to both Le Thai and District One, but left severely wanting. My friend and I showed up on Wednesday night at 8pm, was greeted and sat very quickly. Our server comes by and takes our drink order, returns with drinksand takes our good order as well. We both order the house special Pho (he got the bone marrow scallion oil on the side) and I ordered the house special Bahn Mi as well.  After not too long of a wait our Pho comes out. The meat that is on top is close to the rare/raw side which I'd not s problem as it should cook in the broth, however the broth was more on the high warm side than steaming hot. The broth was okay to good, but nothing to write home about.  The bowl was nicely filled out with noodles and meats, but we both thought the ribeye cuts of meat was a little too chewy, but otherwise nice. After discussing or thoughts on the Pho (about quarter of the way in) the Bahn Mi I had ordered had not come out, nor had our server come to check on us. After asking to see our server and inquiring about the Bahn Mi, I was told that the kitchen forgot to fire it and they would be working on it. By the time my friend and I had finished our Pho the sandwich still hadn't come out. Was told that they were working on it, and because it was taking so long they would comp the sandwich.   It finally comes out, and we try it and I like it a lot. I assume most of the ingredients (bread, pickled veg, pate, maybe the cold cuts) used in it were made in house. I think the Bahn Mi tasted better than the Pho, my friend thinks the Pho is a better value than t he Bahn Mi. Bahn Mi is $9 and the Pho is $12. The Bahn Mi is severed with a side of taro chips, which I am usually a huge fan of, however the order of chips I received was a dark brown mess. It tasted burnt and of oil, and there was no crisp. That covers most of the food side of things. My friend really liked the bone marrow scallion oil, but he did note that it make the Pho very heavy (I had warned him too).  On the service side, I think I saw food runners and bussers more than our server. The guy was nice, maybe he was in the weeds, although it didn't seem that busy. Overall, I think Le Pho is okay, the food is solid, the service could be tightened up (or maybe it was a bad day). The price though I've had similar quality of pho and Bahn Mi in Chinatown for less, but as it is downtown, I understand that the price will be inflated to adjust.",

The service was great - we ended up sitting at the bar and while the bartender had to check on the menu options, he was very friendly and didn't seem to mind my questions.  This is a great location if you're downtown and especially if you live at the Juhl!  Good prices and a nice mellow EDM soundtrack.  I was on my own on Saturday and after a busy day, I ended up back here for takeout.

Pho has been cold, they don't cut the spring rolls in half, or cheesesteak, the cheesesteak had low quality meat last time- it was tough and there wasn't much of it. I come here at least once a week and was just here Tuesday night. The food and service were great, as it is most of the time. When it's busier than usual or they're understaffed, it does take a while for food to come but otherwise, the response rate is pretty great, particularly when you sit at the bar.

    "text": "This recently opened restaurant has good genes with Dan Couglin of Le Thai and Khai Vu of District One being the principal owners.  You can find many restaurants serving pho in Las Vegas, but Le Pho has raised the bar based on our experience, though visitors without vehicles may find its downtown location a bit of a deterrent.       We started off with egg rolls (northern style with pork, crab meat, wood ear mushroom, carrot & cellophane noodles) that were accompanied by a small bowl of dipping sauce, lettuce, carrots and basil.  The rolls were oil free and the best we have ever eaten.  My wife ordered pho gia (chicken soup) while I settled on the pho ribeye.  These were accompanied by fresh basil, lime, slices of jalapeno and bean sprouts.  The base of each soup was delicious, both proteins were succulent tender, and the noodles bountiful.  The sourcing for all ingredients was clearly a cut above as was the decor and service",

    "text": "Im teetering between 3 and 4 stars for this place, but I'll up because I think the potential is there.  Le Pho is a new Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, located inside the JUHL condominium complex. It was created by the same people that brought the popular Thai restaurant, Le Thai, the cool fusion like restaurant in Chinatown, District One, and his brother opened my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town, Viet Noodle Bar. So far, by the looks of it, it should be a success.  After walking in, I noticed the interior has a really cool vibe, with a full bar, and lots of rustic wooden tables laden throughout the restaurant. There is pop music playing in the background, and it just encourages fun times.  I sat down and ordered some dishes. The server was really nice and I waited. What is cool is that there is a Spring Roll bar where all the spring rolls are made. I noticed the Banh Mi on the menu are in the $9 range. Not too sure how I feel about that, but, it could be some super special one that I've never had before. I might check it out.  Knowing that my food would take a while since this was opening day, I won't  comment on how long it took for my appetizer to come out, it was a bit... But there are hiccups to every opening.  Nem Nuong spring roll - they either offer this as an appetizer in a bowl form, or as a spring roll form. I ordered the spring roll version. When it came out, I thought it was OK. The flavors were all there and I really liked the peanut dipping sauce, I thought that the pork could have been better, and the rice paper wrapping was a little tough. But I thought it tasted 'just OK'.  House Special Pho - it came with ribeye, meatballs, tendons and tripe. First, I thought the broth, the most important part of the Pho, was good. A little bit more cloudy than I would have liked, but I could taste the beef and spices. I did have some wilted bunch of basil, but I just put that to the side. The meats were good though.  I was going to give it 3 stars, but it is opening day, and there is always stuff that needs to be refined, even after a business opens. I think when it's up and running at the max, it can just be as successful as their sister restaurants.",

It is relatively easy to find and get to, but you will likely pay for parking (think about $1 per hour). The tables were clean and tidy, along with the rest of the dining area.   The prices are more than fair and you can see the effort in their presentation of the meals. We ordered the crispy wings, not necessarily traditional, but they were crispy, flavorful, and tender inside. The traditional spring rolls were fresh but bland. The peanut sauce served along side it was slightly too sweet, but others loved it.  Now... for the pho! The soup came in a clay pot with the usual fresh basil, mung beans, jalapeno, and limes. This plate was freshly cut and chilled for a zesty compliment to the broth. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was not overly salted. They only have siracha as a chili sauce - but order a side of it if you like your pho a little spicy - as theirs can seem pale compared to more traditional resturants. I'm sure pickier eaters will do well with this version of pho of they have not liked it in the past.  Service was great even with this being a 'soft' opening. Our server was accomodating, friendly, and let us be during most of our meal.",

Tasty meat and vegetables in a crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside roll. The combination of flavors were great. It was served with a small bowl of pho to dunk in and some shrimp chips (imagine pork rinds with a shrimp flavor) They were good, but not something I would crave. I wish the sandwich was served with a small spring roll. Looking forward to going back and yes I will order spring rolls and take what is leftover home with me.",

Jasmine, our waitress, split our bill three ways without even asking, probably used to the work lunch crowd.  On a negative note two of us paid cash and she thought it was acceptable to keep the change and only return our bills.  I don't think this is okay and to me it's basically stealing so I'm not a fan of that.",

We sat at the bar and were greeted by a friendly bartender who got us waters upon seating (super attentive and we didn't have to ask).

We ordered the vegan spring rolls, vegan pho, and the BBQ plate (not vegan). The rolls were tasty! I am not a huge fan of tofu, so I might as for strictly veggies next time. The pho was something that made my heart happy. It was so flavorful, full of veggies... and portion was large enough for two. It's perfect for the upcoming winter and I recommend vegans and non vegans alike order it! My boyfriend had the BBQ plate and loved it. I can't really say much about it, other than he finished the whole Thing with a big smile.   I can't wait to go back to le pho.

Everything I had here was delicious and if you're looking for a drink... order the green thai ice tea!   Tons of different seating options and great for groups. Love the ambiance and vibe that it brings to DTLV.  Street parking right outside.  Thanks Chef Khai!  I'm a fan.  - Miss Yelp 2017",

I would definitely recommend.",

When I arrived I learned that they were no longer serving that item, despite it still being on their online menu. I ordered the bbq pork instead.

My friend and I ordered the diy platter spring roll and the house special pho and we shared everything. It was delicious. The pho bowls are pretty big and they give you plenty of meat. I like how they give you more meat than noodles for the pho. Other places usually go cheap on the meat and give you more noodles. The broth for the pho was good as well. I liked the protein given in the diy platter. Shrimp was good as well. Definitely will come back for happy hour and to try their other dishes.",

For our lunch I had the chicken pho and my wife had a roast beef Banh mi dip (just like a french dip but with pho broth) my bowl was pretty big and filled with lots of shredded chicken and fresh herbs.   tldr; food was good, service was good, and you can get one free refill on the awesome macha thai tea when you check in for the 1st time",

Very subpar. On my first visit I had the vegan spring rolls and what seems to be their signature dish: the bahn mi dipped in pho broth with taro chips. it was like a Vietnamese French dip and was a great value... one of the best things i've ever eaten! on both visits my friend got the vegan pho which is not listed on the menu and neither is the vegetarian option.  I can easily say that this is the best pho for spa I've ever had in my life and this is definitely the best pho in Vegas.   BUT we need to discuss the service. First time around she did not know what vegetables were  in the pho. this happened also on the second time around in addition during my second visit our waitress, who is a different waitress then my first visit, did not know the types of sake they had or types of beer they had, or the differences between beer. Both times it took a very long time to get water, attention, menus for the check. from my point of view, it seems like these are all the servers' first serving jobs. very unfamiliar with the menu.",

Since I moved here 4 years ago I have tried a few times but have been disappointed so often that I kinda gave up. Tonight though I was really craving Pho and decided to give this place a try. I had also read about their Phi Dipped, which is a Bahn Mi twist on a French Dip so it's made with Roast Beef but you dip it in Pho Broth. So I decided that I'd order both and just eat HALF the Pho. So much for that...  Pho Dipped - When I got the sandwich home I took a quick bite and was blown away instantly with how tasty it was. The bread was perfect and the flavors were great. I then dipped it into the Pho Broth. Words really don't give it justice! I have been also searching for a decent French Dip in this town and this may be my new go to sandwich. I can say that nothing I learned in etiquette classes was used eating that sandwich. I only regret not order two  I then finally got to my Pho. I got the special which has Ribeye, Tenderloin, Flank, Tripe, and Meatballs. Yum Yum Yum! The broth is so tasty that I barely added any spice or soy, which I almost always have to dump both into to add flavor. All the meat was super tasty and the noodles were perfect  I have to say I'm now a total fan. Next time I get a craving or Pho or Bahn Mi, I'm definitely coming back here",

I've come many times already in different days and different times of the day. For the most part I have come when it's pretty quiet. Which I prefer. The staff are always friendly and attentive.  I have even ordered take out and it was promptly made as communicated.   My favorite is their French dip banh mi sandwiches. It's the best of both worlds when I can never decide what I want. I'm still not sure how I feel about their taro chips that come with it as I have never tried them other than here.   Are they suppose to Taste burnt ? Not sure. Either way it's great to have something different in downtown. Recommend this place highly wish they had those yummy buns from district one.",

Overall, the menu and prices are pretentious, the broth flavor is lacking and the banh mi has been sold out on a couple of occasions, regardless if it's lunch or dinner. The saving grace was the unique item of the oxtail pho, but lately the preparation has been less than desirable. On the most recent occasion, a live rolly polly was crawling around the mint leaves for the fried egg roll appetizer, solidifying a one-star rating and ensuring I'll never be back.",

Usually tastes like boring vegetable soup. The vegan pho here is right on track, tastes very Vietnamese. Best vegan pho I've had now. The vegan spring rolls were excellent, too. They have fried tofu, shiitake mushrooms, and mint in it. I also had the oysters (excellent) and the poached chicken salad has a light fish sauce vinaigrette which was delicious. I would order everything I tried again. *contented tummy pats*",

Not only is the food really good, but the amount; that was the first time I couldn't finish a bowl of Pho. My family and I came here for my birthday and the employees were so accommodating and nice. It probably helped because they were local (from Hawaii). They also brought out a HUGE piece of cake and Ube ice cream for me. Seriously, this place is awesome and definitely recommend it to Pho lovers and anyone just looking to relax and dine.",

My personal fave is the ribeye pho - however, I'd always suggest getting a bahn mi sandwich just to dip into the broth if you can - they even have a sandwich + broth combo already on the menu if that'd be something you're interested in. So yummy!",

Good place....nothing like the real thing but still worth it. Ordered the Pho with ribeye. I tought the pieces of ribeye were too long and big...kinda hard to work them with chopsticks. Still was good enough and prices were nice. I made a quick stop before heading to Downtown...its a 10min walk.",

The broth doesn't have the depth of flavor a traditional pho place gets and the ribeye appears to be cooked before it is put into the soup and it all in one clump. Lastly they need more onion in the pho.  The add on items are nice but not needed if the meat if these items were just corrected.",

It's off the strip, you can get there for $9-12 Uber ride, it's pretty close to downtown Freemont Street.  Well worth the trip. Try the Pho Dipped is a banh mi which is made with brisket served with pho broth for dipping, it's a Vietnamese version of a French dip. So creative and so delicious! I'd also recommend the pho rolls as a starter, which comes with pork wrapped in flat rice noodles and is served with a fish sauce for dipping. Also really tasty!",

They brought it out with a sake cup. Can I get a tea cup ma'am? When I asked Jasmine about a regular sized tea cup she proceeds to tell me that's what Asian people use. BYE. Is this real life? She then tells me she will order some tea cups. Should have had those on opening day. Oh, I forgot to mention that my tea although in the fancy \"Asian\" tea pot was cold. We asked  Jasmine for napkins at the beginning of service, and I can go home shower make some hot tea, and still no napkins. Every other server here is amazing. They were very friendly and kind.

It took them about 30 min to bring out our appetizers and 45 min to bring out our entrees. I know it's busy but when you see other parties that have arrived after you, receive multiple dishes before you even get any of your food, you can't help but start to feel upset. Really how long does it take to fry French fries? They don't even have soup spoons for you to sip your pho. I was barely able to sip any of my soup because of this. On top of that it's taken them 10 minutes to get the check back to us.   TLDR: you're better off going to a different place where you don't have to pay $12 for a bowl of pho and you get your food within 10 minutes of ordering. The food was decent but not amazing, definitely not worth the value or wait.",

We ordered some traditional spring rolls and Saigon buffalo wings to share and each of us selected the house special pho. The starters came out quickly. The spring rolls were great! The wings were kind of scrawny and seemed over cooked; the buffalo sauce was delicious and VERY spicy, too hot for civilians, but not good enough to rescue the dish. The pho was the biggest disappointment. First, the ratio of ingredients was not what any of us expected; lots of tendon, little ribeye, no tripe. The jalapeno slices were plentiful, but looked bad and we had to ask for more fresh basil so all three us got some. The ratio problem might be forgiven except that it was overshadowed by the completely lackluster broth. Mostly flavorless, we asked for some fish sauce on the side, but no amount of fish sauce or sriracha could generate enough umami to bring it home. We can't imagine what any of the other pho offerings not billed as \"special\" would be. One of the others in our party liked something about the meal and begged me to add one more star, so I did.",

Overall, the server was very slow, and did not know about one of the ingredients on the menu.  I thought that was surprising because the menu is not very big.  This server was not very attentive, and throughout the meal, not to be found.  At one point, another server and the hostess helped us out. I do have to say that the server did get us one comped drink and comped fries (because it was forgotten in our orders.)  We ordered sweet lime soda, green thai tea, BBQ Pork Banh Mi, Ginger Chicken, and the Pho Dipped ($50).  The \"sandwiches\" were both horrible.  Like I mentioned, I had been here several times, and this was by far the worse food I have had here.  The sandwiches were sloppy and the plate itself had no presentation.  The broth was ok.  My wife said her Ginger Chicken was good, but she could not taste any ginger.  It was served with a bed of white rice.  She tried to have me taste her food, but I was so disappointed with mine that I refused.  It's a shame that this place has gotten worse, in my opinion.  Downtown needs lunch spots.  Will not return, and I don't recommend.",

I tasted it for the rest of the day. The bf got the pho dip, very flavorful but the meat was tough and very chewy. They didn't use the thin sliced meat that comes in the pho. The reason he enjoyed it so much is because the flavor was there.",

I sat next to the bar and was given the menu quickly. I was so impressed with their happy hour menu! They had so many options, including chicken and vegetable pho for less than $4.50. WHAT! I ordered the chicken pho and hoped for the best. They also had 12oz beers (Miller, coors) for $2.   To my surprise the pho was very tasty! It had a lot of chicken and noodles. The broth was flavorful too. For the price paid during happy hour there is no way I can complain. I highly recommend visiting then (I believe it is from 4-7pm).   THIS restaurant is only for people 21 and over!!! No minors allowed! Just thought I would point it out since they have a sign inside that says this.",

We had to ask for chopsticks and napkins as we didn't get those with our order.

    "text": "I wanted to love this place, but there was a lot left to be desired.   I was shopping around the North Premium Outlets and had an intense craving for pho. Instead of traveling to Chinatown, my handy dandy yelp app lead me here  (and less than 10 minutes away from the outlets - wooo!)  I ordered their house special pho, nem nuong, egg rolls, grandma's grilled pork, and the bbq plate.   Combination pho definitely satisfied my craving!  A little on the expensive side when you're paying $12 for pho though.   Nem nuong was not worth it, at all. I guess I was expecting something along the lines of Brodards style and I did not get anything like it. I felt like I was eating a spring roll full of lettuce and mint. The pork patty was non-existent and there was no crunchy wonton inside! I was so disappointed.   Egg roll was decent. A little on the small side and I feel the fish sauce was much needed to pump up the flavor.   Grandma grilled pork was recommended by the hostess and she said it was different than the pork found in their BBQ plate. Though their flavors are different, I enjoyed the BBQ plate pork more. Grandma's grilled pork was too salty for my family. And even though I know it's an appetizer, it was tiny. I think there was about 6 pieces of pork in the appetizer.   The BBQ plate was delicious and filling. Comes with pork and short ribs, rice, and topped with an egg. I think this meal has the most bang for your buck. The only thing that was missing was the fish sauce you pour all over the meal. I'm used to doing that at other Vietnamese restaurants, but maybe they don't do it here.   I also think it's crazy that they make you pay extra for the scallion oil and other add ons that are included for free at other establishments.   I really wanted to love this place since I love Viet Noodle Bar and District One, but Le Pho sadly falls short of the other two.",

    "text": "For the most part, I basically only write 1 and 5 star reviews on Yelp.  Le Pho was definitely worthy of a write up from me in the good way.  My wife and I stopped in las night and were completely happy with the food and service.  We were immediately pleasantly greeted and seated by the host who upon hearing it was our first time, gave us her suggestions of what to look for on their menu.  We took her advice on the appetizer and ordered what are eyes landed on for pho, the ox tail and ribeye.  Starting with the Le Roll, it was a great take on the traditional Vietnamese spring roll.  We loved the new approach and of great flavors and presentation while still keeping the essence of the dish.  As we were very hungry walking in, and because it was so good, the appetizer did more than its job by raising our anticipation for our main course.  I had ox tail and my wife the ribeye pho.  Admittedly having a little less finesse with chop sticks as I would like, my clumsy self was able to separate the succulent meat from the submersed bone with ease.  The small effort was completely worth the energy spent the instant I had that first taste of ox tail, pho noodle and broth.  I devoured my entire bowl with each mouthful producing my audible satisfaction.  My wife's response was equally as satiating.  With each initial morsel enjoyed, we'd have those exchange of glances as to wordlessly express \"I know right?!?\".  Being that she has a smaller stomach than me, she was not able to finish her portion, which I had no problem with... More food for me!!!  Having quickly finished my bowl, I was only happy to make sure we got our money's worth and made her dinner disappear.  Though more traditional of a pho than the ox tail, it was still a super tasty execution that shouldn't disappoint any pho enthusiast.  Ultimately we ordered a flan for dessert to end everything on a sweet note.  Which ended up being the perfect end to the meal.  The flan was light and custardy as opposed to dense or over drenched in syrup.  It was bouncy on our spoons and everything a flan should be.  And ultimately, it just the right sweetness to be the last flavors we took away from our visit.  We were very happy with our visit to Le Pho and will absolutely be back again! The food and service was awesome and when downtown craving a newer expressive take on Vietnamese food, we know where we will be going!",

    "text": "This place hits the spot on the right amount of coziness and convenience. There's low lighting and multi-level seating. It's not too loud and there is soft music playing overhead. The music is not intrusive (which means you can hold a conversation comfortably) so bring a date or enjoy your lunch break here in peace.   We've been hit with this cold front that just won't quit and I can't think of a better way to warm up than with a big steaming bowl of pho.   My coworker recommended this restaurant to me and it was a hit. We ordered the ribeye pho for $10.00 each. Once the broth hit the table, I added jalapenos, lime, sprigs of fresh basil,  and chili sauce to let them infuse flavors right away.   The noodles are tender yet springy enough to grip with chopsticks. The flavor from the fresh meat and crisp veggies meld into the broth so much so that you can sip the remaining liquid and still taste the complex combination of savory, citrusy, goodness.   I opted to drink their hot green tea, which is served in a petite, yet heavy, cast iron kettle. Careful, the whole pot is hot to the touch. The handle is narrow and it's a little awkward trying to pour the tea into little ceramic cups.   The service was prompt. We were acknowledged right at the door, asked where we preferred to be seated, and taken care of quickly. The wait staff is friendly and helpful. In other words, if you are a novice to pho, these people won't make you feel inferior. Ask away and enjoy experience!",

    "text": "The vibe here is not like the traditional pho restaurant which is refreshing and different! The decor is modern with a mix of traditional. They have a bar and the lighting here is soft and not too harsh.  The noise level is average - background conversations seem like blurs but you can still talk to your party and hear them well. The menus are on a cork board, adding to the quirkiness and uniqueness of the atmosphere. The walls had art of Vietnam, which I enjoyed seeing, and everything was very well organized, even the bathroom was clean and nice.   Before we walked in, you could already smell the pho broth outside the restaurant.   This place has prices that's a little more expensive than other pho places that I've been to but you can definitely taste quality in their dishes. Their iced coffee drips so you can see the mixture of the condensed milk and coffee. It tastes so amazing - reminds me of the streets of Vietnam! It's not overwhelmingly strong but still has a rich taste to it.  I ordered the chicken pho and the broth was flavorful and the chicken not too tough. Our server, Jasmine, was polite and attentive, I love her nose ring. Jasmine explained the menu to us with confidence! She always checked up on us and talked to us in a friendly manner. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area! It's closer to the Strip than Chinatown.   The restaurant continued to be kind to us even after we paid for our meals. They were so sweet to us that they gave us two flan desserts, courtesy of the chefs. This is a spot that I indeed plan on making a return. Thank you, Jasmine, chefs, and staff, for making this a great first experience!",

Food took awhile to be served; and when it was, I wasn't asked if I wanted anything else. I had to call another server over for bean sprouts and jalapenos...and had to ask 3 times for siracha sauce. I've never been served pho without basic bean sprouts and jalapenos.   Has great potential. But they really REALLY have to step their service game up. One last note, they were skimpy on the noodles. I'm used to tons and tons of noodles in my pho. I ran out of noodles before I finished the meat.",

On a nondescript corner somewhere between the strip and downtown, in a place without the casino foot-traffic of flip-floppy marble-walkers or downtown project coolsters, and in the midst of Bail Bonders, court-goers and Juhlers, you'll find this very rough diamond of a restaurant.  With its pedigree and good chef, one would expect it to be more memorable than it is.  After all, following the Subway-ization strategy that has infected pizza places and burrito joints of late, it has a spring roll bar (sounds like something you'd put on race car in April, doesn't it?).  I mean come on; a bar where they make spring rolls is cool, right?  But even that doesn't quite work because it's in the back, out of sight, not in the front, so you lose the pleasure of marveling over the careful construction of the food you're about to consume.   And the treble-in-paradise acoustics of the room can only be described as Keith Moon doing an extended solo on your eardrums!  (For anyone under the age of 50, google \"Keith Moon\", dammit!)  The core problem is that the menu is as slim as a runway model and almost as simple-minded. I can barely remember what I ate! I think there was soup involved.  In a world where only special sells, and only spectacular lasts, none of that bodes well.",

Throughout our entire meal he never checked on us once, I had to walk around trying to find someone to order a soda. A guy from the bar area seen me looking for someone and he got up and brought a different waiter over. We asked for a soda and a to go container. The guy told our waiter and he then brought the container then took off and never returned.   I had to get up and find someone to ask if I can get my check and pay. I told the other waiter about our service and he didn't acknowledge or care, then our original waiter heard me complaining and laughed a little then had a big smile on his face. Not one time asked how anything was nor did he care. He is horrible at customer service.   I would never go again especially if waiter Richard A. Is there.

It was during the time where Vegas was seeing snow so it was pretty chilly out. Nothing is better on a chilly day than a hot piping bowl of pho!   I was seated right away when I got to the establishment! Granted, I sat at the bar and there were plenty of seats but it still counts!   Le Pho is actually owned by the same people who own District 1 and Viet Noodle Bar. They also own Le Thai too I believe.   There is nothing out of the ordinary about their menu. It's pretty average and has all your usual Vietnamese dishes.  I wanted something cheap and warm but a lot of their prices are a bit higher than the local places. But what do you expect? You're Downtown!   I originally wanted some spring rolls but they almost cost as much as a bowl of chicken pho. So, I decided to go with their chicken pho instead. They actually give a good amount of chicken with their pho! Every piece of chicken was very tender! The noodles were good. The soup base didn't taste like a chicken soup base to me? Or maybe it's because of all the herbs they used that I can't tell? I've had chicken pho before and the soup bases are usually has more chicken taste to it.   Pretty decent food. It's quick! I originally would have given it a 3 stars since there is nothing particularly mind blowing or special about this place. Like, it wouldn't be my first choice for pho. However, the bartender that was waiting on me was really nice! He provided a nice conversation and was on top of everything! Great service and friendly so they get an extra star :)   Not a bad place to go if you're in the area and craving for some Viet food.",

Le Pho ambiance & service:  This is a very attractive restaurant with a contemporary industrial vibe.  Lots of wood, metal chairs, pendant lamps, and tall ceilings makes for a cool dining area.  There's a pretty  bar for the boozers and flat screens strategically placed throughout.  Our server was super friendly throughout our meal and his assistants were great with keeping the table clear. The kitchen got our appetizers and Pho bowls to the table timely.  Le Pho Cuisine:  I ordered the Spicey Chicken wings off the Happy Hour menu.  You get 5 pieces and they were pretty tasty.  I had the Ribeye Pho and it was on point.  The broth was savory, noodles were fresh and the ribeye was delish.  You get a pretty good serving of Pho at $11 a bowl so you're getting value.  They can definitely hold their own versus other Pho restaurants in the Vegas Valley.  Le Pho is another local business I'm more than happy to frequent when I'm in the area.  There's items on them menu I'd love to try on the another visit but that's another tale.  Enjoy!",

The four times were to take my order, drop off food, pick up check, drop off check.  I did destroy the pho when I went back to the office and it was delicious.  Maybe it was just this time where the stars didn't align but I went ahead and took care of the hostess too because they did more work that the server, even taking the pho back to put it in to go containers and getting the check for me.

This is a Vietnamese fusion spot located in downtown Vegas near the court house, with a bunch of surrounding drive through wedding chapels and people just \"hanging out\" and sleeping on the streets.  As I came to Le Pho for lunch, and it was broad daylight ... we never felt unsafe, but I can imagine it's a different story after dark.   We arrived around 1pm and were greeted by the friendly bartender asking us to feel free to sit anywhere.  Then very promptly the waiter (male w short pony tail) brought us water and menu.  He was courteous, efficient and very quick.  We both opted for the oxtail pho and shared an appetizer the Le Pho special roll.  Also ordered a BOGO green thai iced tea thanks to Yelp's check in perk.  Oxtail pho is solid with good broth (not too salty).  Oxtail was cooked perfectly -- moist and tender with a chew.  The meat did not just completely fell off the bone but required chewing off.  perfect!  The oxtail it's perfectly seasoned and each of our order received  4 pieces: 1 large, 2 medium and 2 small.  The pho was ok.  I wish it was fresher.  The Le Pho special roll was good.  Though the roll fell apart when picked up w chopsticks... that should never happen to a well made good roll.  The flavors were good and the key ingredient was the 5-spices pork which made the roll yummy .   The waiter is very seasoned and efficient... during our whole meal, he was solo on the floor and didn't miss a beat.  He checked on us during our meal and was never over bearing.  And somehow he came to us with the check towards the end of our meal at the perfect time!  amazing.    Overall great experience.  We came for the oxtail pho and it Le Pho came through for us.",

I totally get that this is a downtown location and they are probably paying more rent than the chinatown folk so I do totally get it. But still at the end of the day ... its spring rolls pho and thai tea.   The thai tea being a hefty dollar sign as well, for something that taste ... interestingly overly sweet and slightly like mom's perfume.   I mean overall the food wasn't bad, and I was downtown at the time so it was convenient, but I just couldnt get over the bill for two bolls of soup some eggrolls and thai tea.",

They are known for their ox tail dishes, le pho rolls, and their matcha Thai iced teas (buy one get one free with yelp check in).   Favorites: - ox tail fried rice - huge portion - poached chicken salad  Good - le pho rolls (steamed noodle roll with sausage) - combo pho (better at district one)  Meh - pho dip - bread was fresh but soggy and overall just didn't taste very good. Uses the brisket from pho needed to be thinly sliced.   Service was great, food was solid, if i lived nearby i could see myself frequenting often!",

Hands down the best Pho I've ever had, and absolutely loved the giant silver bowl it was served in!   We ordered some delicious little rolls before our dishes came, and in retrospect I wish I would have ordered two orders of those delicious, melt-in-your-mouth delights.

    "text": "Friday afternoon, I came home feeling lousy.  I've been fighting with allergies/a summer cold for a while now, and I was craving pho.   My incredible husband said that he wanted to take me to dinner and a movie, so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and looked for Pho spots near us.    Le Pho was the closest with more than a 3 star rating, so we hopped in the car and drove down.  We're not really frequent visitors to the downtown area, but Le Pho was easy to find, and parking was also easy to find.  Not a huge fan of the \"pay to park\" meters, but at least we were able to park close by!  The spot is clean and open, and we were invited to sit anywhere we wanted.  Our server stopped over and gave us menus, and brought over water. She was super polite for the entire visit.  I wish I got her name.    When you check in on the Yelp app, there is a check in offer for a buy one get one free Iced green Thai tea.  I'd never had green Thai tea before, but this was delicious.  It had a very subtle sweet taste.  I'll definitely be having another one next time!  Happy hour is from 3-6, and we arrived at 4, so we were able to take advantage of one of the happy hour specials:  the Le Pho Roll for $4.    This is absolutely delicious.  grilled 5 spice pork, basil, and other amazingness wrapped up in a rice noodle textured wrapper...we had to let it sit and cool for a moment, but oh man was this delicious!!!  We also ordered the traditional spring roll, which had shrimp, pork, veggies, and noodles.  Perfection.  The peanut sauce was on point as well.  As for the entrees: Morgan had the oxtail pho.  The broth was a little salty due to the meat, but some herbs and sriracha fixed that right up. The oxtail was tender, and practically falling off the bone.  It was really good.  I had opted for the rib-eye pho, as it was the closes to the Pho Tai that i normally get.  This was exactly what I'd been craving.  The broth was so delicious, there was a TON of rib-eye meat in it, the noodles were cooked perfectly, and the addition of herbs and sriracha helped me to spice some of the sickness out. I actually have left overs for lunch today.  All in all, I was very pleased with our visit.   Service was great, and the food was phenomenal.  We both had 2 huge bowls of pho, 2 drinks, and 2 appetizers for under $50.  Not too shabby!!!  We will definitely be coming back!",

I'm not sure if there was a lot close by.  At first glance, Le Pho can be missed. It didn't look like a restaurant from the outside. It was part of a bigger building. But we found it, walked in, and we're seated right away. All the staff we encountered were friendly. And the restaurant was very, very clean. There were two clean, gender neutral bathrooms in the back.  We were given menus and my friend and I only ordered pho. They had other foods too, but my friend and I reallly wanted pho. I believe we got the house special pho (not sure if there's a specific name lol).  We waited maybe 20 mins for the pho. Where we come from, this was a pretty long wait for pho. But we assumed that since it took longer, everything was fresh.  The pho: sooo good! It's not the best pho I've had, but it was definitely one of the best ones. The portion was big. It wasn't too oily. There was a good amount of meat and noodles but not too overwhelming.  Definitely would come back next time I end up in Vegas and want some pho.",

The price is kind've steep. $12 for pho (yikes!). The food took quite awhile to come and they didn't give us utensils so we had to wait even longer.   The food was okay, I've had way better. The pho broth is very sweet. The filet mignon was tender and cooked to perfection, but they skimped on the meat portion. The plate was more pine apple and bell-peppers than meat. And the bbq plate I ordered didn't even come with a side of fish sauce I had to request for it.  Once the food was finished the bill came out and our tab had an extra order of 3 bowls of pho which totaled out to $140? The waitress took her sweet time to come and correct our receipt. And then there is a service charge! Are you serious? Gratuity for 4 people?  Not authentic and pretty pricey.",

For starters I opted for the Le Pho Roll, which was grilled pork rolled in a rice sheet, and sliced for easy consumption. I loved it. The pork had a nice flavor, and the vegetables and herbs were fresh.   Up next was the pho. I ordered the ribeye pho, and added meatball. The broth was superb, perhaps some of my favorite pho broth around. The ribeye was good. Only complaint is the meatball tasted a little too much like meat, and not enough of the weird funk. Still, it was great.   I BSed with the bartender for awhile, and noticed the fine array of Japanese whiskeys they have on the back shelf. I had him pour me a pull of the Hibiki 21 year. That made for a very expensive lunch, but I'm glad I got to try it.",

This time I had to add SALT to their classic beef broth it was so bland.  There are just SO many more places in Vegas that offer bigger portions, cheaper prices, and tastier broth.   Sorry Le Pho, and hope your business the best.",

The chicken Pho is really good and worth every penny spent.  Now the Ribeye is even better than that.  I could litterly eat the ribeye every day.  I ordered the egg roll and spicy chicken wings as an appetizer and those were just as good.  I have never had bad meal here.  I highly recommend this place to every person I know.",

We found this restaurant through Yelp and I must say our experience was amazing! The restaurant has a hip vibe with a nice bar, craft beer and cocktails, as well as a full Vietnamese menu. We were promptly greeted as we sat ourselves by the bartender, she was very friendly and took/brought our drink orders quickly. We both ordered the beef pho and shrimp spring rolls..they were both delicious. The meat was definitely some of the best I've ever had in a Pho soup, and the flavor of the broth was outstanding! I want to try the sandwiches next time we're in Vegas, because they have excellent reviews as well. I highly recommend this to locals and visitors to the city.",

Waiters were still nice, but the broth of the pho had way too much salt and MSG, not to mention they put even more salt on top of the beef.   Apparently the broth is pre-seasoned, and you can't order it with less salt. I'd suggest to go to Chinatown area to get some nicer and cheaper pho there.   Food is 2 star, I added 1 more star for the friendly staff.",

When I walked in, there were 2 employees behind the bar talking. I waited a few minutes before becoming inpatient. So, as my order was staring at me at the hostess stand, I removed the receipt from the take out bag & walked up to the bar with cash in hand asking if I could pay for my meal. A girl came from behind the bar & took the receipt. She then walked to the hostess stand, grabbed my order & said she would be back. She took my order to the kitchen. I work very hard for my $ so I walked out & went to another Thai restaurant that actually acted like they wanted my business. What a shame as it's so close to my house.",

The reality, however, resulted in much \"meh.\"  I ordered the house Banh Mi that included taro chips. The portion was fine, not big. However, the big downer was the visibly burned baguette. Whatever great flavors lurking in the sandwich were destroyed by the overcooked bread. It could be flavor city in there but I'll never know. The taro chips also seemed overcooked -- but that could have been the residual burned bread taste overpowering everything.  Obviously, not every baguette is burned (I hope). But, quality control should be better for a $9.73 sandwich (includes tax).  I'll give it another shot.",

Sandwich was tasty and on point cost of beer was pricey. 2nd time going took 2 other people and given it was packed but finally got a table after about 20 minutes. We all 3 ordered the Pho even more so because we were hungry and wanted to order the easiest thing on menu it took over 30 minutes before we got our 1st soup only 1 came out had to wait another 15 minutes before the other 2 soups came out, would have liked everyone to get their food at same time then when we did get it it was wrong. Could have been a simple fix because by the time our waitress finally came back we had picked out all the stuff that didn't belong in it and she could have just gotten us extra steak meat instead of just taking our soups away and it taking another 15 mins to yet receive a new one, which I suggested. We did get 2 fresh bowls and it was tasty decent broth still not as good as kim pho long my favorite place to get pho but it was good. Lack of service since, our waitress was so hard to flag down and not very good at her job and it taking a total of almost 3 hour just to eat so pho is way too long. I might give this place another try and see how it goes.",

I have never had pho before so I had egg rolls (which were so good I ordered some to go) and Vermicelli Noodle Bowl and it was very good AND filling! Our waitress Melissa was helpful in explaining the beer selection and all my questions I had about the menu, she recommended the friend rice and it was also a good choice. All in all I would definitely come again.",

It makes it so you cannot have the vegan pho because the noodles are totally bland as well. This place would do well to improve the flavor of their food. Especially considering the prices are quite high.",

    "text": "My husband and I have eaten at many, many pho places and decided to stop here during our trip in Vegas bc of the 4 stars. Restaurant was clean, ambiance was inviting, hostess greeted and seated us right away. I ordered the house special pho for $12. It came with ribeye, flank, tripe, tendon and meatballs, so the works. Husband wanted the same thing, but without tripe and tendon. When our food came out, everything looked amazing. As we started eating, we kept finding HUGE pieces of ribeye slices in our bowls and if you've eaten at any pho restaurant before, you know that the meat slices are thin and able to be eaten without having to cut it apart first. Bc we had to cut it up first, we didn't really care to even eat the meat. I also found a few pieces of ribeye bone fragments in mine which def wasn't a good thing. Afterwards when our bill came out, I was charged $12 for mine, however hubs was charged $16 for his which didn't make sense bc his bowl of pho was exactly similar to mine but without tripe and tendon. What the waitress did was charge him for a ribeye pho ($10) and then did an add on of tendon (extra $3) and another add on on meatballs (another extra $3). Not sure how she thought that made sense, but overall, wouldn't return since the pho was not up to par.",

The main thing I wanted to comment about is the hypocrisy of telling a guest that we do not use straws, a big push from California's thoughts on being green,. The fact is it's a fad,and farce, the real problem is not straws its diapers,  really I've seen the pictures in recycling of our trash in the processing center for a MAJOR city. Again the politics in this food establishment is to say the least stupid.Who wants to touch their lips to a glass foggy and blemished from the lack of a clean glass.I would rather take my chances licking my floor. I asked my server for a straw, he said rather pugnet, that they no longer have straws and pointed to the sign, really ??? Looking around to the service bar there were at least 4 cups,  all with PLASTIC  straws...plus your bar gives out PLASTIC stir straws in there drinks! Give up your politics, and stick with customer service, and when you do something like this, go with a paper or aluminium straw! No longer my favorite pho spot just another fake green initiative from someone who thinks that it is something cool...not cool!",

    "text": "Located on the ground floor of The Juhl directly on the corner of Bonneville Avenue and 3rd Street. Ample street parking surrounding the building and beyond. Very easy to access and away from the the usual tourist traffic of DTLV.  After three visits, I've had a really good sampling of the menu. There are still a couple dishes I want to try, so I would definitely try those on my next visit. Bottom line: great food and great service. Although the location is very far from me, I'm happy to make the drive!  Chicken Wings ($7): Crispy Wings quick-tossed with housemade tamarind sauce; topped with garlic chips. The chicken is cooked well and the sauce is delicious. There is a Five-Spice Salt and Pepper version ($5) offered during Social Hour (4-7PM daily) that is also really good.  Egg Rolls ($8): Fried Northern-style with pork, crab meat, Wood Ear mushrooms, carrot, and cellophane noodles. Crunchy and tasty; a solid egg roll.  Traditional Spring Roll ($7): Shrimp, pork, vermicelli noodles, fried wonton, bean sprouts, mint, and lettuce. Decent, but nothing exciting.  Vegan Spring Roll ($7): Fried tofu, shiitake mushroom, bell pepper, grilled onion, lettuce, mint, and bean sprouts. I love this option for my non-meat eating friends, but there wasn't a lot of flavor going on.  Le Pho Roll ($7): Grilled five spice pork, basil, lettuce, and scallion oil. So, so much flavor in the pork and accompanying ingredients. The rice noodle is perfect, too. This is my favorite roll!  Nem Nuong Roll ($7): Vietnamese pork roll, fried wonton, lettuce, bean sprout, and mint. Just like the Traditional Spring Roll, this is just okay and not very exciting.  Bo Bia Roll ($8): Lap Cheong, dried shrimp, shredded omelet, and jicama. This is a fun \"breakfast\" roll that is also very tasty.  Lotus Root Salad ($10): Lotus root, pork, shrimp, roasted peanuts, cilantro, and fish sauce vinaigrette. Served with sesame rice crackers. I love the crunch from the lotus root and everything tastes so great together. Great low-carb option without sacrificing taste.  Vietnamese Poached Chicken Salad ($9): Poached chicken, cabbage, red onion, rau ram (Vietnamese coriander), crushed roasted peanuts, fried shallots, crushed shrimp rice crackers, and fish sauce vinaigrette. This was good, but no exciting flavors either.  House Special Banh Mi ($9): Toasted French baguette with pork cold cuts, pork pate, mayonnaise, pickled daikon and carrots, jalapeno, scallion, and cilantro. The bread was crusty, but soft, so it was the perfect vehicle for this popular sandwich. Tasty, though it could use more meat!  Pho Dipped Banh Mi ($11): Toasted French baguette with slow-cooked beef brisket, bean sprout, basil, pickled daikon and carrots, jalapeno, hoisin, and sriracha sauce. Served with a bowl of pho broth. Even though I'm usually drawn to a traditional Ban Mi (I loove the meats), this is a really great sandwich and their pho broth is seriously amazing.  Ribeye Pho ($10): I had this on my first visit and it revived my faith in Pho. Again, the broth is phenomenal and the vermicelli noodles are just amazing. I've had the House Special Pho ($12) as well with Ribeye, flank, tendon, tripe and meatball. Also wonderful.  Vermicelli Bowl ($17): Grilled pork, lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, crushed roasted peanuts, scallion oil, fish sauce, and vermicelli noodles. *Add Shrimp and Egg Rolls. They have the best vermicelli noodles in town; it's slightly thicker and have a great texture. The dish itself is fantastic. The charbroiled pork and shrimp are really delicious.  Ben Thanh Market Fried Rice ($12): Dried shrimp, Lap Cheong, eggs, and diced asparagus. Topped with salted egg yolk. Everything about this dish would make me think I'd like it, but it was rather bland compared to a lot of the other flavors going on in this place.  Hoi An Chicken Rice ($10): Poached chicken, pickled daikon and carrot, and turmeric rice. This is very similar to Hainan poached chicken. The chicken is flavorful and prepared nicely. The rice is also tasty and everything is great together. Add Nuoc Cham for added deliciousness.  Duck Noodle Bowl ($15): Five-spiced braised duck, thin egg noodles, bok choy, shiitake mushroom, organic Onsen egg, scallion, and garlic chips. The dish was a little salty, so that made it hard to fully enjoy, but the noodles and ingredients were great.  Wok-Tossed Filet Mignon ($18): Wok-tossed filet mignon and seasonal vegetables with black pepper sauce, watercress, red torpedo, and spring onion mix. Served with white rice. A good version of \"Shaking Beef;\" flavorful and tender steak.  Banh Beo ($9): Steamed rice cakes with ground mung bean, dried shrimp, scallion, and crispy pork rinds. Not bad, but it was missing crispy shallot and lacking slightly in flavor.  Favorites: Le Pho Roll, Bo Bia Roll, Pho Dipped Banh Mi, Ribeye Pho, House Special Pho, Vermicelli Bowl, and Hoi An Chicken Rice.",

    "text": "\"Even in Town they make food for your people?\" begins Midwest poker bud as we look over the menu.  \"That's it, guys, it's time to play Fear Factor, Asian style with the gentleman of fairest complexion\" I announce to snickers, then...  \"Haha, no weird Asian stuff!\" joyfully proclaims farm boy America.  The brainchild of  Chef Khai Vu of District One, Le Pho serves Americanized Vietnamese that happen to work well while grabbing a drink on a DTLV pub crawl.    Americanized equals familiar flavors and ingredients.  No culantro, lighter extraction in the pho broth, unusually light hand in use of fermented fish sauces, sour flavors missing.  Bottom line, traditionalist, don't ditch your favorite Chinatown Vietnamese eatery just yet.  First and foremost, this is a bar that serves Vietnamese food not the other way around.  Food pairs with drinks.  For shareable dishes, \"Grandma's Grilled Pork\", soy marinated pork cheeks; juicy,  somewhat chewy.  A tasty bar bite.  Good assortment of rolls, the egg roll, crispy and stuffed full with pork, crab, shrimp, rice noodles, and toothsome wood ear mushrooms.  Rolled in lettuce, dip in the sauce.  Good as any.  Interesting \"Le Pho Roll, unmistakable flavor of five spice pork and lettuce rolled in a wide sheet of uncut pho noodle and dressed with a scallion oil.  Interesting but one dimensional.   A lotus root salad with pork, shrimp, cilantro, peanuts dressed in a fish sauce vinaigrette and served in crispy, airy rice cracker has an unexpectedly mild flavor.  Eat it fast or the cracker gets soggy and sticks to your teeth.  The pho doesn't measure up to that of its sister restaurant.  Perhaps an off day.  Light and almost watery.  The house special contains a good portion of raw ribeye, flank, clean and tender tendon, soft tripe and meatballs.  Opt to add some bone marrow for added richness for $1 more.  Begs for hoisin and chili oil to be dumped directly in the bowl but satisfying none the less.  Note:  Typical Southeast Asian service.  Dishes are brought out whenever they are ready.  This is customary.  If you don't like it, order in waves but be prepared for some annoyance on the part of the servers.  Decent selection of beer.  Reasonably priced.    Pub crawl worthy, yes. Meal worthy?  That depends on you.",

They were bit a greasy and soggy.   Nem Nuong: 3 pieces on a bed of white vermicelli noodles and lettuce and they were pretty good.   Duck Bowl: option dry or in broth and we got it in broth and it was extremely bland. They served the dish and forgot noodles!   Pork vermicelli bowl: decent. Didn't like that they added fish sauce when served.   Pho: overpriced and broth decent.",

I ordered the Le Pho roll which was delicious. Probably one of my favorite dish. And the duck noodle - also very tasty. The Chowfun with shrimp- the shrimp was so salty. And also the $17 vermicelli with egg roll and shrimp - shrimp also very salty and definitely not worth the $17.   I would come back hear just to eat the Le Pho Roll again. I guess come during lunch time when they have all the items available.",

The first time I came was during the first week or so of opening. The place was swamped as to  be expected. My friend and I sat at the bar. Our orders were messed up, and I ended up taking most of my order to go due to using most of my lunch time waiting to get the food fixed.  The second time, I was blown away with the service. I was with about five other people, and the service was amazing. Everything was correct- food came promptly.   And, then I went this past Friday, and the service failed, again. It took forever to get my friend's and my food ordered. I never really saw our waitress despite ordering and paying the bill.  However, despite the bad service, the food is great! My favorite is the Pho Dipped. I've ordered two of the three times.   Perhaps, the alternative to the bad service would be asking for my food to go?",

    "text": "I love that this place is literally a block and walking distance from my job.  It's definitely something different from the usual burgers, pizza and salad.  Finally, more diversity.  I read that this place is owned by some of the other Vietnamese Pho places like So Pho 1 that I usually go to.    The inside of this place is very nice.  Looks very... classy and upscale, but it is a casual setting.  I like how there's a hostess that seats you like you see in a fancy restaurant.    Food.  I ordered a Ribeye Pho and the Nem Nuong Roll, all to go.  The egg rolls at Vietnamese restaurants are one of my favorites.  Although the size of them where a tad bit on the smaller side from what I am use to at other Vietnamese restaurants.  These were way smaller.  I enjoyed the flavor, just not the size, especially for the price.  I guess that is what is expected coming from a downtown joint.  The Ribeye Pho was good too.  The flavor of the broth was good, but the ribeye itself, there was something off about it.  I don't know if it was just me, but the meat to me was chewy.  But it all tasted good.    Will I come back, definitely.  So with that being said, happy eatings! @~~}~~~~",

    "text": "I'm a low-carb eater, so you might think a Vietnamese noodle house would not be high on my lists of go-to restaurants. But Le Pho has some of the best salads I have ever eaten. So even if I don't partake of their tasty-looking noodle dishes, this is one restaurant that I hope to put into heavy rotation.  I have been to Le Pho twice now, and both times service was quick and friendly. On my last visit, I had the poached chicken salad ($9), which I probably would have considered the best on the menu if I hadn't had the watercress beef salad ($12) the previous week. Both salads were perfectly dressed (nothing ruins a good salad more than a heavy hand on the dressing), with a nice balance of meat and vegetables. The chicken salad was tossed with a light, sweet fish sauce; and the beef salad had a heartier ginger-soy blend. Beautiful presentations both times, and the portion sizes were just right.  Another great thing about Le Pho is that they offer iced green tea. None of that nasty passion-fruit concoction here! I usually order a glass of wine with a salad, but the tea here is so good that it literally made me into a teetotaler--at least at Le Pho! ($3, but well worth it.)  I may be the only person who orders salads here, but as long as these two winners are on the menu, I'll keep on ordering them. Delish!",

    "text": "This place is PHOnomenal! Le Pho is my favorite place to eat in DTLV; I'd even venture to say it's one of my favorite places to eat in the whole city. In fact, when it came to soup, I was an I-prefer-ramen-over-pho type of person until visiting Le Pho. Now I'm obsessed with pho, though I'm finding other establishments don't really compare to Le Pho. Of course, with any restaurant, much of this can be attributed to personal preference but let me break it down for you:  Ribeye Pho ($10): The broth is perfect- it's so flavorful. This is a favorite of mine and I've had it many times. There's plenty of nice pieces of meat- meaning, you don't get just the fatty pieces. Personally, I enjoy clean pieces of meat so this is a winner for me. You can split this dish, and all pho dishes, into two bowls for an additional $3. They charge you extra because you get a little more pho than when it's just in one big bowl.  Chicken Pho ($9): Before trying the Chicken Pho, the Ribeye Pho was the apple, er.. pho, of my eye. Now, I constantly crave the Chicken Pho. The broth is also incredibly flavorful and delicious. Plenty of meat-- a lot of white meat, which I enjoy. The noodles are perfect as well.  Oxtail Fried Rice ($14): Amazing flavor. This has become a regular order for me and my boyfriend. Pro tip: get it with a fried egg on top for $1.50 more.  Traditional Spring Rolls ($7): Had these once with the gluten free option. The wontons were removed and I was offered fish sauce on the side instead of peanut sauce. Nice, fresh flavor. Great beginning to your meal.  Chicken Wings ($8): The tamarind sauce is very tasty. I love the flavor combo going on here. You get six wings per order and my only complaint is that they are on the small side.  Taro Ice Cream ($5): This was a dessert option the last time we dined. We thoroughly enjoyed the combination of taro, shredded coconut, and crushed peanuts. It's perfect for when your belly is full of pho but you still want something sweet to top off your meal.  I've enjoyed everything I've tried with the exception of the Bone Marrow Fried Rice. To me, it tasted heavily of fish sauce, but I don't even know if that is a key ingredient. I'm not a big fan of bone marrow in the first place so don't let my opinion on this dish sway you away from trying it. I'd like to sample more of the menu but I come here for the pho!  My only gripe is they can be inconsistent. One time I ordered Chicken Pho and it tasted like a different broth than usual. We also brought some friends here and the Ribeye Pho was so incredibly salty. We were slightly embarrassed after raving on and on about the broth; we insisted to our friends that it's not usually that salty. One thing that is consistent though is the service. The waitstaff and bartender are always fast and friendly. Veronica is our favorite!  Oh, and if you have allergies then you'll be in heaven here. They are allergy friendly and many things on the menu are gluten free or optional, including all the pho. Just talk to your waiter about your restriction(s) and he or she will check with the kitchen for you.  Give this place a try! I'm so addicted that I make the drive from Summerlin to DTLV once a week just to eat here. I recommend Le Pho to all my friends and family!  TL;DR  Get the pho.",

    "text": "In a city where there are plenty of late night Vietnamese restaurants to choose from, it might feel hard to stand out. But Le Pho is a truly a memorable place in my mind for a number of reasons. First of all, the decor is gorgeous! The deep green wallpaper and wooden tables are so romantic. Also, the big windows give guests a beautiful view of the City Hall's light show at night and plenty of people watching in the afternoon.   Now when it comes to food, the flavors of Le Pho are unmatched. One of my favorite Vietnamese dishes is vermicelli with pork and egg rolls. This is by far one of the best egg rolls I have ever tasted. It doesn't taste homemade, but the flavors are so rich - there is no need to dunk it in sauce.   My only gripe is that it's a little pricey for what I'd typically be willing to pay for Vietnamese food, but the portion sizes are generous so I'll let it slide. Overall, I am a fan!",

Service was wonderful and we never had an empty glass.  After loading down with pho it was well worth the $3 fare for an uber back to Fremont street!",

The Ribeye was thinly sliced and it just melts in your mouth. The spring rolls have a crunch to them and the ingredients are so fresh! We're from Tucson, Arizona and it beats any of the Vietnamese restaurants we have there. I may have to move to Las Vegas just to come here once a week.",

Pow-Pow! Best ox tail pho in vegas! Flavorful broth but not over fully fatty, just perfect. The filet mignon aka bo luc lac was so tender & juicy just melts right at the tip of your tongue prepared on a bed of veggies with watercress! Don't worry , if you get thirsty , look all their big drink bar! Full of selections & those copper cups! Oh Do I smell MOSCOW MULE ?!?!? Great ambience & customer service just right in the heart of downtown, adjacent to city hall.",

We ordered the egg rolls and spring rolls, and both were great. The egg rolls were light and flavorful. Definitely a treat, unlike most cookie cutter egg rolls. The star of the show was definitely the pho. I ordered the house special and added a poached egg, it was awesome. The misses order the ribeye pho which was also awesome, she also ordered the bone marrow oil which added a richness and dept of flavor to the pho. Thanks for the great service Jasmine, and thank you for answering all of our questions about the menu!! When in vegas, this will definitely be a must go to for lunch or dinner!",

    "text": "First off lets just say this....Food, great. Atmosphere, great. Service, great. So why the 3-stars? I'll just tell you a little story. I had a brand new debit card. NEVER used before or after eating lunch here, yesterday. However, I awoke this morning to find that $400 had been stolen from my account through a keyed-in card entry through a Square merchant account to a company named Fast Go, out of Brooklyn, NY. The first for $370, the second $30, and an additional failed attempt for $100.   Now, to Le Pho's defense their card processing machine is out front where the customers can see it. However, the thick asian waitress (three waitresses walking around at the time, can't recall her name) that served us, swiped the card to process the payment, then looked up at me (as if to see if I was watching) and smiled, then disappeared around the corner for a couple minutes before coming back with my card to have me sign. Coincidence? Maybe. But I can guarantee if I ever go back, I'll pay with cash. Cancelled the card. Reversed the payments. Will get my money back in a few day.",

Though the restaurant was modernized, the menu was authentic Vietnamese food. I ordered a pho with beef balls, and my boyfriend got a pho with all the different meats. This is the first and only place I've been to that had green thai tea on the menu. As an avid thai tea lover, I had to try it. It tasted almost the same as regular orange thai tea, but with a bit of a matcha taste to it instead. It was delicious. Our food arrived quickly. The broth was really hot, but didn't burn our tongues! The meat was great, and the broth was delicious. Not bland or overly salty. I was content. I was only able to finish half of my pho, but my boyfriend finished his and the rest of mine.",

(I'm spoiling myself. You should too.) As I tend to do, the first thing I do when I get back to civilization is get some pho. Being that Portland considers itself the pho capitol of everything, I was a little cautious at best, bring my first time in Vegas. I was pleasantly proven wrong! The drinks are top notch and the pho is fresh, delicious, and very quick. I am impressed. Will, my bartender/server guy, was friendly fast and efficient. And it was only after I ate that I found out tonight was their soft opening. I'm doubly impressed. You'd have thought they'd have had years of practice. So if you like pho and stiff drinks to go with it, this is your jam. I'm not telling any off my Portland friends, but this beats most their favorite places.",
