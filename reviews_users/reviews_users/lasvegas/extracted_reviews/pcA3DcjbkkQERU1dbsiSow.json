    "text": "Cold chicken, and warm hummus.   Seriously. I ordered a delivery from this place, and I was stoked to see they had no delivery fees, and the food arrived extremely quickly.   That's why receiving cold chicken was so perplexing.. Had it been sitting there already? Receiving cold chicken in a manner that fast, was akin to going into a bathroom nobody has been in, but the toilet seat is mysteriously warm.     What's up with that?  Also, the hummus was warmer than the chicken, and was also extremely oily. Luckily I didn't order it, but they felt the need to throw some in. At first I thought it was a nice little bonus or gift, but after getting it, it's obvious they can't sell the stuff.   Finally after an ordeal, they refunded 25% of my check.. yay.     UPDATE: I see the owner responded with an explanation of the cold chicken that at least makes sense. I will give this place another chance in the future, because it does seem like a lot of others are very happy with it.",

If you really want to have good, big and yamy meal this is the perfect. They have outside tables do you can enjoy the fresh air. Can't say enough about salad addressing it is AMAZING. Im trying to purchase it and I asked the owner to ship it to my address in Pittsburgh and he welcome it. Great team great food and great experience. Definitely worth to visit again.",

Service was great, the food was delicious (some of the chicken shawarma was a little too crispy on the edges for my liking) but the generous portions and fresh ingredients made for a great lunch (and dinner!) It was a bit warm in there, seemed as there may not have been any AC going, but minor issue but not a deal breaker  Knowing this is a halal restaurant, I will absolutely be back :)",

When the barista was gone and I wanted a cappuccino they offered me plain brewed coffee for free. Then when the barista returned I got the cappuccino also for free. I ordered a tzatziki dip with pita . When I finished the pita and still had more dip left they offered more free pita. Then before I left the manager or owner came and asked if I would like to try a vegetarian dish called Kuku. Wow. All this service . I will gladly be back",

I have had better baba ghanoush; but taste is subjective. The bread is very tasty as well and is similar to Lebanese bread or pita.   For the lunch special the portion size is well worth the money. The rice is good and the chicken is very tender and well flavored. The lunch special also comes with a standard side salad. I just wish a different vinaigrette was offered besides balsamic. Perhaps a pomegranate molasses dressing would be a bit more tasty and compliment the chicken.   Overall, chickpeas is worth trying. I will be back to try their koobideh.",

    "text": "After a long Memorial Day in pool I felt like having a cheat day!  Yes my cheat days seem healthy to most...but we eat oil free so this was a cheat day.  We ordered a huge delivery and it was A-Ok.  Huge portions, fresh food and overall yummy tastes.  Hummus was on the oily side but it was creamy and not toooo much garlic. Don't get me wrong I love garlic, but too much in hummus can cause indigestion.  The falafel would be best not delivered but eaten fresh on site. Yes its the green kind but it seemed hand formed inside of the machine ball or tool ball way.  The tabouli salad was super yummy to me, lots of green onion, which was different.   The baba was not as smoky as other places. Hubs normally does not like it but he tried this and liked it!  Ikra was yum, hubs didn't like the smoky flavor of it but I did!  All and all I would rank it in my top three of Vegas. Hubs said its better than Amena...but I beg to differ. Amena will always have me heart!",

    "text": "Really bad service at this place. I came in during lunchtime, and it was completely empty, but fully staffed with 4 people.  I ordered their lunch special salad with salmon (simple, right?)  I watched them fill a catering order, fill up the display case, clean, chit chat, and do things in the back, while I waited literally 20 MINUTES for my salad.   Plus, they seemed so disoriented and lethargic trying to put together one catering order!!!  Since I was the only person sitting in there waiting to eat, you'd think they'd throw together the lettuce and salmon in a relatively timely manner. I even had to check on the salad!   The food: The salad was ok. Dressing was bland. They give you a big piece of salmon, but it's covered with a thick minced garlic paste. I would never go back here, and I don't recommend it.   I honestly don't understand how this place an average of 4 stars. What a dive.",

Nothing makes the experience better than to have a genuinely friendly person right from The start of your visit!   I got the chicken shawarma plate. Large portion and rich in taste. I felt bad because I saw Chad throw butter on the grill so I asked him to remake the chicken for me. And he gladly did it without one ounce of hesitation or remark. He did it with a happy smile. I will say that the food, even after the remake, didnt taste as clean as other places I've tried. But that's just my preference! I want to come back and try their other menu items because everything is made in house!   They even have an array of hot sauces; sriracha, tapatio etc...love that just because it caters to everyone.   I do wish that the plate came with pita bread. And chicken could taste a bit cleaner. Other than that, GO CHAD!",

They don't skimp you on anything. I spend $15 on chicken shawarma and an iced tea, and this will feed me for the next 2 days. Two people can easily share a single plate.   The only thing is temperature. Although I did get my food delivered, I wish it was a little warm, and the same thing with the pita bread. I needed to heat up everything. I personally like my pita's thinner, but it's a bit difficult to heat up pita bread. So I wish they would have warmed it or wrapped it in foil or something.   Delivery is fast if you don't feel like going in, but they will definitely see me more often!",

    "text": "I haven't ordered bad delivery in Las Vegas in a very long time. This was outstandingly bad. I covered enough of the menu with my order to know I would be out of my mind to ever try this place again. We'll start with the worst first.   Lamb shank: straight to the trash you go. The lamb tasted very old, rubbery, dry and gamey. To make the dish even worse, they included rice that was seasoned so heavily it was like someone mowed a lawn and dumped it in their rice cooker. (How can a restaurant screw up rice?!?!)  Chicken Wing Kabob: the menu said it was \"marinated\"... I have strong doubts. There was little flavor and the meat was very overcooked. Far below average, do not recommend.   Lamb Pizza: I picked off the lamb after my encounter with the lamb shank and just ate the cheese and bread. It was acceptable.   Greek Salad: So close to passable. The vegetables were fresh unfortunately, they didn't peel off the outer layer of the onion so I got to take out the skin before eating. Maybe they got busy?  After tasting kabob, salad, lamb and pizza I have to give this restaurant two stars. They did well on the bread and the staff was friendly, but a good meal is more than cheese and bread. Hopefully they can improve the dishes or change the chef.",

The schmancy hotel casino's laundry service is so expensive I couldn't fathom paying $5 to wash a single pair of underwear even if I happened to be rich as fuck... Anyway, I jumped on yelp and another doob and Lyft later I'm at the Coin laundry grooving to Micheal Jackson mixing a lethal baking soda/bleach mix for the tightie-whiteys. Was gonna kill the 20 min wash time with another doob so I started to walk around the strip mall, passing some random flooring place so weird bar Asian barbecue which almost tempted me but then I saw these words...  CHICKPEAS.   Fuck yeah the best decision I made this day while barely functioning. Creamy hummus warm pita...  Served by cuties I was in heaven. College football playing...This is THE hangout spot when guys running errands and his girl and her family's is back at home and he literally has a 20 minute why cycle before he has to get back in dry the whites.

When I was in the Army in Germany , we would go to Crete , Greece every year for training and would eat lots of Greek / Mediterranean food especially the Lamb Gyros . My son and I usually go to Gyro Tyme for those , but they close early and we work late .   I came in at 7:30 pm to place order to go . There was one guy waiting for his order . I ordered the Chicken Soltani Kabob plate and a Lamb Shawarma Sandwich . There were two ladies working to counter and later I saw another lady come from the back . One must have been new because you could tell she needed lots of help . Two men came in after me and sat down after ordering , then another man who came by himself , then another for a takeout . The two men got their bowl , then the one man got his plate and the lady looked at me and said mine was almost done . They then gave the other his takeout . 30 minutes and I finally got my food . When I got home , my son and I shared the food .   The rice was very good , the chicken barg was good but not the ground chicken , and then the lamb . The lamb was overcooked and tough and I mean tough . The pita was very thick also . It came with a salad with the plate and fries with the sandwich . Total was $29.09 which was a little much and we didn't even eat much of the sandwich , just threw it away and ate the chicken and rice . Needless to say we won't be coming back which is unfortunate since it is so near to us . If I ever do go back I will just get the Chicken Barg Kabob bowl .",

Falafel was gritty outside and soft inside.  Found out why the inside had a green color just by asking.  Nice! Guessed what that flavor was in the salad dressing!  Decidedly Asian!  Their cucumber water in a jar was the perfect antidote for today's 104 degree heat.  I was given the wrong directions so there was some frustration getting to the right corner.  Cost them one star.  Patio was inviting, have to try when temps cool down.  Will be back!",

    "text": "We stopped in to Chickpeas early on Saturday, for a light snack before disc golfing.  The inside is simple, and clean, although a bit confusing...with the counter set up, it has the feel of a fast food joint, but the tables and chairs, and actual plates/silverwear give it a sit down restaurant feel.    We ordered the shawarma: falafel for me, chicken for my fella.    It came with a small, light salad;  lettuce, cucumbers, and tomato tossed in a super light dressing:  This was good.  I don't even like cucumbers and tomato, and I enjoyed this.    The sharwarma sandwich wraps are enormous! So much for eating light!!    The falafel was absolutely perfect.  Seasoned well, not greasy, very flavorful.  The pita was great too! Can I mention the chicken wrap?  Because it is FULL of chicken.  Unlike other places that skimp on meat, and fill the pita with lettuce, etc, this was CHICKEN.  And its GOOD chicken too.  Tender, juicy, cooked really well...A+!!  So, if the experience was so good, why not 5 stars?  Well, service was polite, but I think we confused her...when ordering the shawarma sandwich, we wanted everything (hummus, tahini, garlic sauce, and the onions/lettuce, etc) except baba ganoush.   We didn't get any hummus, or tahini, or garlic sauce at all on the wrap.   It was still delicious, but we both REALLY wanted those things on the wrap.    We'll be trying it again, for sure...I thought I saw that they deliver, so that definitely might have to happen!!  All in all, it was a great first experience...just next time remember my hummus!",

    "text": "So decided to come check out the lunch special here at Chickpeas Mediterranean Cafe. I loved mediterranean food plus never been so bonus review material. I ended up getting the ground chicken kabob special. Talk about getting thrown for loop when I got my food. I was thinking chicken on skewer. Or for the most part all the times I have had Mediterranean food that use to. The cut of chicken may vary but it looks like chicken. Not that this kabob does not have chicken. IT does just grounded up mixed with have no idea. It form like long stick length just like kabob (no skewer deal with....plus). Odd. The flavor be honest not that bad. It nice moist, taste like chicken, and just different approach. The salad that comes with it refreshing basic salad greens tossed with house dressing. I like the fact it hearty with cucumbers, red onions, and couple nice roasted roma tomato. The rice pilaf is cooked perfect. It just plain rice not seasoned just fyi. The amount of food you get for lunch special it awesome deal! I know for under ten dollars even with drink walked out full.   The inside is much nicer then the outside or that little shopping mall. The tables and chairs are really nice. Not what I expect of small restaurant in small shopping mall. They have nice little outdoor patio with plants around and nice outdoor weather great spot for lunch or dinner. Inside they have one nice widescreen that can watch your favorite game or am sure you can ask change the channel. The kitchen is open kitchen so if want entertainment while waiting right there. They even deliver but do charge $3-5 depending on the miles away.   Not sure if was the owner but one of the guys in the back handed out samples of two different hummus. One was yellow and the other red. Not sure if they plan on putting it on the menu or could have been on the menu. Honestly just had my focus on the lunch specials. lol!! It was nice of the guy hand out little dixie cup samples. The yellow not fan but the red was really good. Hopefully the next time go back they have it on the menu. The whole staff was awesome. The gentlemen took my order to the guy handed out the sample and ask make sure give him feedback. I love that about small business owners. They appreciate customer feedback!!! Worth star by itself!",

By the time I got home I had thought about what had just happened. I decided to try a bite of chicken and we all know how rice tastes so there was no need to try that.i ended up throwing the hole plate away in fear of what was in his nails (not to mention in his ear) I will try again but not if he has dirty nails again.",

At first, we were a little put off by the prices that seemed higher than in our neck of the woods (on the other side of the 15). However, we were pleasantly surprised by the ample portions and the very fresh taste. We ordered the kabob plate and really enjoyed them and the salad was amazing. We definitely left feeling like we had enough food after sharing one meal. We also enjoyed sitting out on the patio (the music was a little loud for us inside).",

They are all so friendly and welcoming that you want to come back for that reason alone. But don't worry their food is also amazing and cooked right in front of you. It doesn't matter if you're a Mediterranean junkie or its your first time ever experiencing these delightful dishes, they take the time to explain everything to you. One of the nicest things they do, that 99% of restaurants don't do, is serve you a complimentary drink and or salad while you're waiting. They do this even when you order  takeout. Top Notch Customer Service! Its a small, brand new restaurant, on the corner of a strip mall. Their meets aren't dry or overcooked! They're moist and flavorful. Their rice is always cooked to perfection and even the vegetables seem larger and fresher then most restaurants! Can't find a single thing to say bad about the place. The only thing I wish they had was an outdoor fireplace or pit. It would be nice to be able to sit out on their patio when it's cold.",

The cook was too busy taking orders and talking to customers to pay attention to the food. The tabouli salad was a big disappointment. There was hardly any tabouli, it was all parsley. We ordered a medium and it was enormous. No one ate more than a few bites. The cook made a mistake on our friends order and he didn't get his food until everyone else was finished. They have some great lunch specials. I would still give this place another chance but order something else.",

    "text": "This place was awful. We ordered two Beef Filet Saltani Kabab Plates, the Mazza plate and a side of fries. The kebabs were dry without any flavor, the beef filets were just awful they werent seasoned at all and it did not taste like filet minion, it tasted like old meat that had been sitting in the refrigerator and they heated it up and delivered it to us. The rice was good. The only thing in the Mazza plate that was good was the Tzaki sauce, everything else was tastless and bland. The fries were all burned, it was like they put the leftover scraps at the bottom of the frying pan in a plate and gave it to us. Overall, the place was just horrible! Not to mention the piece of metal like thing my husband found in his plate of Beef Filet Saltani Kabab. What kind of a place leaves a piece of scrapped metal in a customers food?? We called and they reinbursed our money for just hubbys plate since mine did not have that metal thing in it,  at least i did not notice it. Anyways if you are looking for a good mediterranean restaurant with great kebabs, appetizers and just great food then go to shish kebab house! They are the best in town. We should have just ordered from them again rather than trying this place.",

It's good knowing that Alex and the people who work here are friendly and courteous. It just shows how much they care for their customers. I finally chose the Koobideh Ground Chicken Kabob. I like how the chicken is so tender and flavorful. It came with a good amount of basmati rice, one grilled tomato, and a nice crisp salad with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and red beets. I especially love their savory homemade dressing. Since then I have tried another item like their Chicken Schawarma plate, serve with a generous portion of marinated chicken, basmati rice, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers. But I always seem to have a particular favorite when I come here. The Koobideh Ground Chicken Kabob will forever be my #1 choice.",

As far as the food, it wasn't terrible. It was OK--just not spectacular where I would want to return again and again. I had the salmon kabobs. It had a strange yellow color, and at first glance, I thought it was chicken. They told me it was the seasoning. The salmon was a bit on the dry side, but not bad. The pita and hummus were fine, and the salad was OK although I'm not a fan of beets, but that is, I believe, Greek style.",

Now let's get on to our meal of oday...  Although our receipts says the time of 11:36, our first dish was not brought in till 11:55.  This was one kabob with rice while the rest of the family waited.  How could I eat while my family remains hungry?   I waited.  At 12:15 our main dishes were brought out, but not our pizza.   It was at this time I asked them to reheat up my food as it got cold sitting on the table for 20 minutes.  Imagine that! 20 minutes and your dish is waiting on the table while everyone else simply waits for there food.   Around 12:22 the veggie pizza comes out and placed on our table...OMFG!!  The entire pizza was burnt!    It took them 46 minutes to bring out a burnt pizza.  I wish I took a picture of it. Perhaps these two guys were busy with just two customers in the building??  By this time, we just decided to leave and get a refund for the overly burnt pizza.     After an hour ordeal, we walked away hungry and disappointed with this business. I am sad to see such a wonderful place become a complete disaster overnight in less than 24 hours.    This was going to be an easy FIVE star review.  Hopefully someone in management reviews the tape and sees just how long we had to wait and what we went through.    If this does not get fixed, you may want to reconsider going to this place on a Saturday afternoon.    Best of luck!",

I am a fan of consistency when it comes to a restaurant because then you know what to expect, unfortunately that is not the case here.  1st time had the Caesar Salad w/ Chicken Shawarma it was very good, nice flavors and huge portion.  2nd time had the Caesar Salad w/ Chicken Shawarma, it was ok, not great but not bad, huge portion.  3rd time had the same exact thing, this time the chicken was fatty, salad was very watery and it just didn't seem at all the same as the previous 2 times.  I don't know that we'll be returning considering the # of options we have the nearby area for food.  If they were to push the flavor and consistency a little more it would get at least a 4 star for the pricing and portions.  Until then, we'll stick with 3.",

The beef barg plate was $13.95 and in comparison to shish kebab house it's way expensive. I would definitely save my money and go to Shish kebab house instead.",

The Cashier did not take the time or courtesy to explain to me when I ordered that the lunch special comes with one strip of kabob and to get a second one I could have paid a mere two dollars more, the only thing the cashier said was to mix and match I'd have to order off the standard menu, when I asked the cashier if I could pay the additional charge in order to get the second strip of meat as the price of $9.99 he said NO, you have to order another new order?! I was disappointed and it was not like the place was busy, the restaurant was empty around noon , the food was good but disappointed with the service and lack of care for the customer",

Their servings size is great because - well - who doesn't love GREAT hummus?  And it was GREAT.  Perfect blend of chickpeas, tahini, lemon and garlic.   I really wanted a Mazza lunch platter and 2 kebobs but found out from the web site I could not order that.  I was bummed so I ordered a Greek Salad with chicken and the Mazza and shared.  More than enough food for 3-4 people.   The only thing they can maybe take away from me is I would love the option of a Mazza with 2 kebobs.",

None of the items were over salted, which I usually find at casual/quick Mediterranean or Persian restaurants.  I cannot comment on the atmosphere, as we had delivery.

The food was not as good as the reviews say and the service was horrible. First off, the salad wasn't bad tasting but it was more of an Asian flavor than middle eastern, so it didn't really go well with the kabobs.  Second I asked for the kabobs well done, not burned, well done. The guy looked at me like I was nuts. One side was not cooked and the other side was burned. I also asked to have the tomato well and that wasn't cooked through either. If you ask to have your food cooked well done, there shouldn't be any attitude about it, especially when you're a paying customer.  I would advice the owner to make sure his employees not give attitude to customers and for them to learn how to cook food properly.  Would not recommend this restaurant to people who are looking for authentic Persian food. If you don't care and want generic middle eastern food this is your spot!",

Ordered our fave, chicken & beef \"lule\" combo & a side oh hummus. Was recommended by \"Alex\" who took our order when we couldn't decide if to try the Gyro or the lule plate. Food came in fast starting w/ the salad, then hummus w/ pita bread. Have tried hummus in different restaurants before but this one was good. Salad was big portion & their \"own family secret\" dressing blended well with our taste buds. Then came the main dish & wow! Big portions indeed! The meat was juicy & tender & really good. We got excited & texted pics to our adult kids who loves dining out like us & told them to check it out! Alex came over to check on us & mentioned that 2nd location opening in 2-3 weeks which is closer to where we live. In fact, was so satisfied that we plan to take the family & some close friends to celebrate my wife's birthday dinner at the new location (hopefully opened by then). Nice to have a good place to eat & really enjoy good medittarenean cuisine. Cant wait to try their other delicacies",

Literally, the chicken schwarma bowl my gf got was three meals worth of food. The food itself is decent. Not the tastiest but also not bland. I tried a beef kabob which was okay. It really begged for more variety, but it is a relatively simple plate. It still came with a huge mound of rice.   The chicken schwarma was tasty when mixed with sauce and rice. They have very tender chicken but I'm not a huge fan of the rice style, but that might just be me.  The staff was friendly, but the service was honestly a bit slow. While the fresh salad was a good way to hold me over, I was getting a little impatient by the time we got our food. I'd say it was a good 15 minutes after the salads.  Prices here are very good for the amount of food received. I'll definitely be back to try some of the more premium kabobs.",

We took it to go to eat at home.  I'm sorry to say but the food here sucks.  We got a crap load of rice and only one skewer of chicken each.  MY CHICKEN HAD A RAW PIECE!!!!  F***** disgusting!!!

    "text": "I've updated my review because I don't want this incredible place to be downgraded just because it lacks atmosphere.  It does, since it's a counter-order place with some tables, but the quality and quantity of what you get is simply beyond compare.  On our last visit, it seemed that the prices had been lowered.  That, and the absence of diners on a Saturday night, make me think that you'd better get there soon if you want to try it.    Hubby wanted the barley soup he had last time, but they were out of it, so he got lentil instead.  Loved it.    We ordered the mezze platter to start, and could not believe what we got for $6:  good-sized portions of hummus, babaganoush, and tzatziki, along with two falafel, tomato and cucumber salad, tons of olives, and two large stuffed grape leaves.  If we had stopped there, we would have been fine.  We did stop mid-way, because we also had ordered a ground mixed kabob, which came with salad and enough rice to feed all of Monaco.  They brought us two salads, each huge, and with tomatoes that were actually red!  Everything was fresh and delicious.  We took home so much food that we had dinner for two the next night.  That's when we had the grape leaves.  I never could stand them before, but these were incredible.  Before finishing this review, I checked the menu online.  They haven't updated the prices, but they are indeed lower than what they are now.  Don't wait!",

    "text": "Addendum:  Was in town and just had to visit this place again. Just like the last time, great service and food and doesn't disappoint.  I ordered a greek salad on the side and the feta cheese was so fresh, moist and yummy! Which was probably fresh and UNpasteurized which unfortunately I cannot have right now. So went back inside (was sitting at the outside patio) and asked the employees. They said it should but seemed to question it themselves. As I sat back outside, one of the employees came back and said to be on the safe side, I probably shouldn't eat it and was happy to bring it back and make me a brand new one without the feta. That was awesome how careful and sweet they were. Can't wait to come back and eat it with the feta cheese next time when I finally can!  Note: Salad was yummy but not the traditional greek flavor which is more vinegary & garlicky. Instead it does have more of an asian soy saucy flavor. Still really yummy but then again, I'm asian so it prob taste yummier to me then to some people.  --------------  Was craving Mediterranean and decided to give this place a try and so glad I did! For the price you pay the portion itself is unbelievable. Most other places are pretty generic in portions and cost. The plate was $10 here so i assumed it was like most other places and my goodness the plate was enough to feed 2 people! (See pictures)  We ordered the ground beef and chicken skewer mix plate which comes with a side bowl of salad. The meat was flavorful and tender. Not dry at all. The salad was also a generous portion and their dressing was delicious! Simple yet flavorful. The rice I will have to say is the only thing that could be a little better. It wasn't flavored enough or shall I say enough butter like a lot of places do but in exchange, its much healthier that way. So I don't mind. We also ordered the chicken shawarma plate and it was charred perfectly. They have their own tahini sauce recipe that atop the shawarma plate. By itself, it tasted a bit plain and bitter with a nutty twist to it but the sauce goes with the chicken wonderfully! I even asked for extra sauce on the side.  They also make pizza too (and they have a huge pizza oven as well) which is out of ordinary but since I didn't order any can't rate much on that. Maybe next time.  Service: They were great. It think its a family owned operation. It does take a little time to prep your food but thats with most Mediterranean style restaurants and they were all working hard. I did hope they would have warned me how big their portions were so we could've ordered differently.   Ambiance: A little small shop with a little outdoor patio seating area thats pretty nice.

Friendly staff and quick, efficient service.  Enjoyed a very good Falafel sandwich and perhaps the best Baba Ganoush on the planet . . . do not miss it! Backlava is also outstanding.   Certainly seems as though just about everything is made in house . . . and it shows. Good portion sizes and very reasonably priced.  Lots of vegetarian options as well.  No beer & wine . . . a bit of in an issue for me.  But they said that I could bring my own next time. Looking forward to returning soon!",

I selected the beef kabob and the chicken combo plate to take home. Everything was perfect and the simplicity of the dishes made it that much more enjoyable. This is a great option for anyone looking for a good kabob fix, or any other Mediterranean classic.",

The dude was so willing to give me anything I wanted that he must of not realized I didn't know what there was to give. This review is based on a delivery so it might differ is we were in house. The food took about an hour (not complaining) but what we received was less than ideal. I got the falafel sandwich combo. The fries were dreadful and my goal was to put them In the sandwich but they went straight to the trash, they were both soggy and some how mushed ( I really hate mashed potatoes) the falafel were dry as hell and tasted almost too much of cinnamon. There were four huge balls but it was so much to get threw I gave up after 1/4 of the way, basic veggies were throne inside and not even seasoned. This was one of the weirded falafel sandwich I've ever had, also tasted like they had been sitting, not freshly fried, no crisp just mush.  My friend got the beef shawarma sandwich, he just ate the mashed potato fries, but when he took a bite of the sandwich he spat it out and claimed it was all gristle. I don't like looking at other people's chewed up food but it seemed like there was no beef on his sandwich but just fat, he got all the veggies on the side and took some olive oil and balsamic and made a salad. Smart man, all in all I couldn't recommend eating at this place to go and probably won't go back but maybe if I'm desperate?",

Its a fast and casual restaurant where you go up to the counter to pay first and then they'll bring the food out to you. The place isn't too big but there's also patio seats outside. The place was pretty clean, also - which is always a good sign.   As soon as we walked in the girl with glasses at the counter sort of just looked at us really quick and just went back to talking to a co-worker. -_- We didn't get a hello or anything. Made our way to the counter to order and all she says is \"What can I get you?\" Yeah, hello to you too. I'm fine, thanks.   She looked like she hated her job more than life itself. I ignored it because I was starving and just wanted some food.   Ordered the ground beef kabob for dine in. I was hoping to avoid anymore contact with the girl at the counter but she brought out our food. I was hoping she would be a little nicer this time but nope! \"Here.\" And then she threw our plates down on the table. \"Need anything else?\"   It came out pretty quickly and I was amazed at the portions. It filled me up pretty well and had nice flavor to it.   Overall, the food here is pretty good...too bad the service is shit. It disappoints me to write such a bad review based on one person - as I've seen other people that have had better service from other employees. Would I ever come back? If I was in the area and craving Mediterranean food, then yes.",

The service was friendly but didn't seem to be familiar with the menu. As for the food, I ordered the chicken and beef kabobs- $18 for two kabobs, plain white rice (where's the flavored rice?!) and grilled tomatoes. The flavors were OK.   I don't think I would come back though....",

    "text": "Our large family was really hungry and driving by, and we stopped here because it was close and had good reviews. Yelpers are not always to be trusted in their reviews, but this place deserves the high marks.  We had the tabouli, shirazi, cucumber salads, baba ganouj, hummus, tzatziki, kash-k-bademjan, as part of two Mazza plates.   This was followed by several kabob dishes that we shared: ground beef, ground chicken, chicken  breast, and filet of beef kabob.  All dishes were freshly prepared on the grill in front of our eyes. We ate heartily, and took home leftovers, as portions are large. The meats were all tender and juicy, even the chicken breast.  Starters all are made in house and fresh (we asked). Recipes are simple and authentic. Nothing tastes pre-made or frozen here. We didn't try the pizza, but they have a legit wood stone oven like I've seen in some high end restaurants.  The place is kept clean, not like the dingy middle eastern places I'm used to. The menu is displayed on large monitors, iPad based payment system that is modern.  I think Chick peas is worth the drive even if you don't live on this side of town because they use fresh, high quality ingredients at a budget price. We'll be back.",

    "text": "I've driven by this place a bunch of turns and finally tried to try it.  I am persian/Iranian and this \"Mediterranean\" restaurant is persian food.   You order at the counter and they deliver to your table.   So we ordered five different entrees plus a salad hummus and soup to get a variety and have extra for the lunch tomorrow.    I asked the girl if they had anything g other than white rice. She said that's all they had and had sold out of everything else.  I noticed a persian guy who came in after me got zereshk pollo (barberry rice). Was it discrimination because they didn't know I was also persian?? Maybe just bad service.    The lentil soup was good. I think I tasted a hint of cinnamon.    They didn't have any tahdig.  The hummus was good. It tasted like it was made in house. Mostly smooth with just a little bit of graininess. Subtle hint of tahini.    They don't have joojeh kabob but they have chicken wings kabob style.  They take a 25 minute and unfortunately came out dry.   The kabobs : first off in all fairness my standards are super high and my gold standard is Raffis Place in Glendale, Ca.   The beef barg was chewy and overly spiced with pepper.   The beef and chicken koobideh were both a little rubbery.   The chicken barg was just chicken breast.  Not much flavor of anything. But it's better than the over peppered beef barg.   Back to the rice.  It has food yellow coloring and not True saffron.   Entree comes with a garden salad. The salad came with some pickled onions and beets which was a nice touch.   I also got a shirazi salad. The dressing didn't have much lemon flavor but it was still good.   There are better persian places in town that I'd probably go somewhere else next time.",

Problems: rice was warm but cooked properly. Kobideh had good flavor and freshly cooked. The filet kabob (I question it being filet miniogn) was pre-cooked. No taste. Kabob needs to be cooked fresh. Good portion. Salad was good but they should have selection without salad as not all Iranians eat salad with their Soltani order. No somak, onion bread or butter served served with the order. Spanish music played. I would go back if I am assured I will get a fresh hot platter. Maybe some Persian instrumental music.",

I am giving a for star because of the desert. I took baklava which was price around 3-4 $ and there is no walnuts in baklava just cinamon. It was so weird. They put a little bit of pictacio on the top but mainly you can taste cinamon which was so weird. Baklav with cinamon???? But everything else was nice.

The food was mediocre - I got the beef shawarma sandwich and by sandwich i mean in a wrap. I literally had to dig for the beef. it was 98% salad 2% meat. and their salad was bland, limp and tasteless. I even deconstructed and poured tzatziki all over it. didn't help.  My lunch date had the Lamb Shawarma. He let me try the rice which i thought was the best of what we ordered.  The portion on the plate was large again mostly the salad and the rice though you could see his lamb.   Phat Phriendly:  Inside comfortable seating. They have a lovely patio that comes with a HUGE honking warning sign - Furniture only holds up to 200lbs. Sit at your own risk. guess that cleared that up. I couldn't help but stare as there was a cute guy with a very cute dog on the patio. looked like the dog weighed 200lbs.   We'll try something else there going by my 3 times rule - maybe the babaganoush since everyone here seems to like it.",

    "text": "I came here on a Tuesday. I called in advance to ask if I could use their WiFi. I brought my car into detailing across the street and meanwhile I wanted to come eat here and work on my computer. Staff was very friendly upon arrival. I did get the WiFi :) although signal was slow meh but it worked. There's both inside and outside seating, ordering must be done inside at the counter. I ordered the lentil soup (they didn't have small size only medium and large, which I find very weird). I got the salmon over tabouleh from the lunch menu. And I ordered baklava for dessert.  It took a very long time to get anything served. It didn't bother me as I had time. But they seemed busy even it was 2pm.  The lentil soup was great, lots of vegetables and not overly seasoned which I like. Medium was for me a very large portion. It came with fresh bread which I found ok, didn't really eat it. The salmon on tabouleh was good. The salmon is grilled on a stick. The tabouleh has strong flavors. It was good. The baklava was delicious. I paid around $22 for the 3 items. Great place and good service. Free cucumber water at the self serve station. Busy place, great for lunch and I'm not the only one that believes so.",

There is some really good smells coming across the counter.   I enjoy a wrap and decide on the grilled chicken wrap. All wraps are done with a 9 inch pita. The chicken is marinated and season well. There is Persian cucumbers, parsley, red onions, Roma tomatoes, and tahini sauce. It's huge and the chicken is big and chunky. All the flavors are so good. One is enough but it was so good I wanted more.   Haven't tried their plates or any of their salads but they look really good. Prices are reasonable, an average salad at most places now costs about $10-12 dollars, and my wrap was $10.95. For the size it was well worth it.   Food was fresh, made to order and season well. Would recommend this place for good food.",

    "text": "Ive been trying to find Mediterranean places closer to my house and came across Chickpeas and decided to check them out. I got my order to go so I didn't eat there and can't really comment on the service.   I ordered the Greek salad with the chicken Kebob. The salad was large and filling. The kebob was flavorful but the chicken was a tad bit dry but nothing a little dressing couldn't fix. Speaking of the dressing, it tasted kind of like soy sauce to me but a vinaigrette at the same time. Now, I know that probably sounds super unpleasant lol but it was actually pretty tasty and added a little saltiness but not in a bad way. The ingredients were also all really fresh which is always nice to see.   Overall, it was a good experience and normally salads leave me still hungry shortly after but I didn't even finish this one and had some left over because I got full. I would eat here again and next time will check out the restaurant and see how the service is.",

I would definitely return, and next time will be sure to order some sort of sauce or hummus.   Thanks Chickpeas!",

The salad that came with each dish was a medley of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes and some strips of pickled turnip with a dressing of oil, red wine vinegar and a 'secret' spice.  Nice outdoor patio if the weather is right.  We will definitely come back when we are in Las Vegas.",

The kabobs were juicy and flavorful. There was yellow and white rice...I'm Asian so I'm used up the heavy starchy calories rice, but this was so good, I'd like to eat more. Finally...I don't usually eat tomatoes in general, and having them grilled to be eaten doesn't really appeal to me either, but I figured I'd try! And man...I'm glad I did! I took a piece of the tomato, a piece of my kabob, and a little rice and it made for the perfect combo! Now...all they need to do is have a location in Henderson and I should be set!

Fast forward to Black Friday, Shawarma House chose to close on this day; I wanted kabobs, so now here we are... given the distance between Chickpeas Cafe and my house, (11.5 miles), you'll understand why I was hesitant. There is little worse than cold lamb chops made to travel 30 minutes while their hummus compatriot does the opposite and gets too warm to be trustworthy. I was SO pleasantly surprised! Not only were our lamb chops and kofte delicious, they were cooked to temp per our request, and made it to my house hot and perfect. What we got for my hard earned bucks was well worth it, and the hummus was outstanding! Just the right amount of tahini, lemon, and garlic; simply yummy! AND our delivery guy was sweet, respectful, and very, very professional. Chickpeas is a win all the way, we will be back   Just one note... A little extra Pita bread is always a good thing",

Some times with friends and relatives. We will go back whenever we have the opportunity. The restaurant is clean, very friendly atmosphere, excellent food and prices are very reasonable. Recently, they revised their menu. Excellent selection of tasty foods. We have been there with freinds and relatives, they love to go back there too; they really have enjoyed it. This resturant has a great menu, Pizzas, Mediterranean, and Persian dishes, as well as fresh pastries and bread that they bake every few hours. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Officially open September 1st, Chickpeas is the newest Mediterranean spot in Vegas. Food is fresh and flavorful, and there's covered patio seating.  Menu has all the usual favorites: shwarma, tabouli, hummus, pita. Meats are available as plates, sandwiches, or (allegedly) on salads. They also offer breakfast.  I was thrilled to see Oliviet (Russian potato salad) on the menu! Unfortunately they were out of it on my most recent visit. Menu has no clear appetizers section- cashier had some difficulty adding a small order of falafel, as the menu only offers it as a plate or sandwich. Ordering \"Greek salad with chicken shwarma\" got me a side salad and a shwarma wrap, which isn't what I had in mind (salad topped with meat).  Ordering issues and new-opening kinks aside, the space is clean and organized. The falafel is soft and flavorful inside, but could be a bit crisper on the outside. It came with an ample portion of tahini sauce. The greek salad was tasty (heads up that it's pre-dressed) and the veggies were fresh. The shwarma wrap was nicely seasoned, and had a good amount of tomatoes and red onion, and a generous portion of meat. Unfortunately, the pita itself was falling apart before we were halfway though, which got messy.",

The falafel I ordered did not taste fresh, nor did it have the texture of fresh falafel--it tasted like something that came out of a package as opposed to something that was made in-house. Very disappointing. The shawarma was also not as tasty as it was last time; the lamb had a bit of an odd taste to it, the chicken was more palatable. But both also tasted too salty, once again like they were not using fresh ingredients. I'll give them 3 as an average of the initial 5 star experience and this 1 star experience, but I will probably look to other restaurants, particularly for falafel.",

It took twenty two minutes to serve the maza platter. Keep in mind this is a cold appetizer platter, everything is already prepared all they had to do was plate it! There was no other patrons ahead of me and only two tables came in after me. Everything on the platter was bland except the tabouli which was just okay. The humus lacked tahini, garlic, lemon, salt I have had better off the supermarket shelf. The mazza platter does not come with pita bread instead it came with something resembling cold mini pizzas, useless for eating the items on the maza platter. About ten minutes latter the kabobs showed up. They were tough and also had no flavor and also were not served with bread. The people at the table next to me, who were having issues of their own, said \"if you want bread you have to ask for it\" seriously? Chickpeas has the distinction of being the first Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant in the world out of the 70 or 80 that I have eaten at that did not serve me pita bread with maza or kabobs. With all the great Middle Eastern restaurant choices we have in this town I can not find any reason to return to this place.",

Ordered breakfast: Denver omelette, pancakes, chicken schwarma platter, Turkish coffee and fatoush salad with beef schwarma. Very traditional and healthy. Roast potatoes are wonderful.",

The dressing used for the salad is the bomb! The lamb could have been a little more tender and little less grisssel. And the portions were more than enough.",

    "text": "Had really high hopes after reading the reviews. The smell in the restaurant was enticing. After returning and opening up the packages, the portions are extremely large. I'm assuming that's why people give such high marks on the reviews. After reading that the pizza is the most highly rated item on the menu, I should've known. The hummus, chicken shawarma, tzaziki, and tahini all lack flavor and seasoning. The shawarma is cooked to a leathery complexion with the consistency of a well worn shoe sole. The flavor doesn't come across as being anywhere near authentic. The pita is flat and chewy. The tzaziki tastes like plain yogurt. The hummus tasted like there was little to no seasoning in it. If a Mediterranean restaurant that names itself after hummus' main ingredient, it should be delicious, if not servicable. The falafel was tasty and the lentil soup was decent, so there's that. If you want Greek food that is always dependable and delicious, The Fat Greek is just one street over.",

No one asked me how I was doing if I needed anything.",
