Just those two items cost $8 or so. I think it's a bit overpriced for what it is. The burger was almost half the size of a regular burger. Maybe they smushed it by accident? I still give them a solid 3 stars.",

    "text": "My East Coast friends swear by this place, so I had to at least give it a try.   My friend and I ordered their Shake Stack Burger, the most special part is the portobello mushroom, and regular fries. With the hype of this place burdening my mind I thought that this place was just A-OK. Don't get me wrong their burgers were tasteful (the mushroom was a very nice addition) and not too shabby at all; but I don't know if it's the West Coast side of me that will always love the taste of In-n-Out more. However, I did like that the burger felt toastier and 'softer' which was nice. The review on fries are that they are crinkly fries which is a nice change from our regular skinny/steak/curly fries but still ... just fries. I tried my friends cheese fries and I definitely thought that the cheese they used could've been cheesier both oozing texture wise, to the taste to intrigue my palate more.    This place is rumored to be packed to the point where the line will be out the door, luckily I have been blessed to have missed that crowd and to order within 10-15 minutes of my arrival. So be prepared to have the possibility of waiting. There is a large amount of seating and the dining room is lovely with the sun peaking through.",

I usually don't like buns, but they have a great bun, full of flavor and not just 'fluff'!   I usually want ketchup and mustard on the burger but the cheese is enough for me!  $5.19x2  Hot dog. Crispy beef dog, fried and split, on another awesome bun! $3.25  Crinkle cut fries. Awesome!  I usually find crinkle cut fries to be very soft, but not this place! $2.95   Chocolate malt shake.  Definitely chocolately goodness! He loved it.  $5.25  Vanilla frozen custard. Creamy and rich. Definitely worth the calories. :D  $5.00  (I wanted the concrete but figured I'd better go for the classic for the first time.)  Lemonade. Refreshing. $2.75   Prices = moderate. Total $31.97 for all of the above.    Our only complaint... loud music made it hard to have conversation!  Service = self service. Order at the counter, and then pick up.  We snagged a table before ordering, because there were six of us.  There are two lines for ordering.....1) all menu items and 2) shakes/concretes/custard only!  And this place is known for lines whether at NYNY or in the State of NY!   Enjoy!",

I am not a huge fan of cheeses but my mom and boyfriend LOVED the burgers. My favorite thing was the mushroom burger that we ordered, i still havent found another fast food vegetarian/ vegan option that can compare to it. The place is pretty pricey but for the quality of the food is worth it. My only problems with my experience was that our oreo shake was HORRIBLE it was thick (which i like) but it tasted like nyquil and chocolate mixed together. I honestly could have vomited after tasting it and also the tables are not clean when you sit down, so i suggest asking someone to wipe them or wiping them down yourself like we did with some napkins and water. I will definitely be coming back.",

I have heard the original Shack is located in NYC and if this is any indication of the original, I'll be coming back to Vegas again and again and again.  We visited the Shack during the less busy season of January so the tourists weren't in FULL swing yet, but it was still quite busy, so we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted because the menu was visible as we stood in line.  We weren't very hungry, but wanted to try a variety of items since it was our first time.  We decided to share a Shack Burger and a Shak-cago Dog.  We also got an order of crinkle fries with cheese and a large diet coke to wash it all down!    There were 5 of us and our order came to about $21.  We found a large corner booth that fit all of us.  We were given a buzzer to alert us when our dinner was ready.  It took about 7 minutes to get our food and we were super excited!!!  Everything was delicious.  The hamburger was small like a larger slider style and we ate it all quickly! The hot dog was the best, just too small for 5 people to share...haha.  We got back in line and ordered another round of burger, dogs and fries!  We mixed it up a bit and got Smoke Shack burger which was the winner of the night.    We are heading back again tomorrow for lunch.  Gotta get a concrete icecream sundae :)  Tips and Tricks...We were told it was located inside the food court of NY/NY but it's actually outside on the strip next to the Brooklyn Bridge.   Refills are free and they bring you a new cup of your choice of beverage!  Get the chz fries, with the chz on the side....game changer!!",

I ordered the Shack Stack burger: Cheeseburger with a fried portobello mushroom & muenster cheese. It supposedly came with the shacksauce but I couldn't taste it at all. The mushroom had a VERY weird taste to it. I love mushrooms. I don't understand why the flavor was so weird. I didn't enjoy eating this burger at all. I can make better burgers at home myself. I hated the flavor so much I needed ranch with it but they didn't even have ranch -__-   I also got a beer float. Which was chocolate beer and vanilla custard. It tasted like root beer... Still confused if they served me the root beer instead of real beer. I did not enjoy it either.  My boyfriend ordered a Smoke Shack: Cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and shacksauce. The flavor on this burger was better than mine. It was very heavy on the peppers though. Still, didn't get to really taste that shacksauce because there wasn't a lot and the peppers over powered everything.   We shared the Cheese fries: nothing special either. Crinkle cut fries that taste like they came out of those frozen bags from the store. There was no seasoning at all. The cheese didn't even taste good. Seems like they got generic canned cheese and threw it on top.  So, I don't understand the hype about this place. The meat on the burgers aren't even good quality. Very thin and not great in flavor either. Tasted to me like the patties from McDonalds' cheeseburgers.",

And a side of fries to share. And our free shake for which we picked coffee  Wow. This is heaps better than in and out. The burgers were fresh, delicious and not too greasy (a bit of grease though!)   Fries are excellent  and not oily at all.   The coffee shake is the absolutely best!!!

    "text": "was craving a fried chicken sandwich. and as i've eaten at shake shacks all over the world, they do deliver good overall quality. the food was a tad bit salty but that was not a surprise, but the chocolate malt was especially good. the last time i came in march--the lemonade and burgers were great.  (free refill on my lemonade!)  my main reason i wont be coming back to this location is the parking policy started in april 2016.  if you drove in, you have an hour of free parking--after that, it's $7 additional for whatever food you are trying to spend money on at the MGM hotels. now, for any food place, there's going to be a line or wait. the line at the shack shake takes at least 10-15 minutes. i found myself trying to nudge people along in the line--and the cashier's are not arrayed in a clearly visible manner off the main queue. it must be so frustrating for them to keep waving at distracted orderers. it's a lot of pressure to wait 15 minutes in line, then another 10-20 minutes for the food--and shake shack is about the farthest distance from the parking garage that could be imagined.  i ended up feeling like i had ran a sprint, waited, ate like crazy, and sprinted back to the car.    i do admire that the employees there are fairly productive but quite nice to the customers. there was one annoying customer that kept asking for additional thing after her burger arrived--she had misunderstood that the regular burger (even though it says on the menu clearly) does not come with toppings. but the food distributor lady was very polite, even after several requests by the lady for this, that, then the other. she has quite the patience.  shake shack is solid. the employees work hard. but for the price and all the competition out there, it's not worth the stress of trying to complete a nice dining experience in under 60 minutes, esp with the parking garage a full 5 minute sprint away. i'll save my shake shack visits for other cities and, in las vegas, i'll stick with a place with free parking or 1.5 hours of validated parking...",

    "text": "It's been over 6 months since I've been out to Vegas, and to Shake Shake specifically, but since when people ask me for recommendations in Vegas, SHAKESHAKE is basically my #1 recommendation, I figured I'd better write a review! I initially heard about ShakeShack from friends that traveled to NYC, and basically it was described as a \"classier In & Out\" Burger.  haha, which may or may not be True.  They have different menu options, so that is what appeals to me.  As a Vegetarian I was thrilled by their SHROOMBURGER on the menu!!  It was nice to be able to have actual protein source instead of just getting to try fries & a milkshake like at other classic Burger Places.  Also, when I was there I ordered the CONCRETE-SHACK ATTACK with chocolate custard, chocolate truffle cookie dough, chunks of dark chocolate and plenty of chocolate sprinkles and fudge sauce!!  And naturally I ordered crinkle Cut french fries to accompany all this yumminess!  My hubby opted to by a pure Chocolate Milkshake as a classic, and a baseline to compare to other places.  He did think it was delicious, but after having a few tastes of my Concrete, I think he wished he would have opted for one of their specialties!  And, you can even design your own concrete, and pick the toppings to go in as well, so that is always an option if you don't want to try their Signature Concretes.  To be fair, in Vegas, there is not a shortage of burger places such as Gordon Ramsay, White Castle, Wahlburgers, Burger Bar, Fat Burger, In & Out etc.  And, I haven't been to a majority of those to be honest, so I can't really speak to what ShakeShack compares to.  But, I just figured that I'd trust New Yorker's... I figured they would know what is up with their New York-based fast Food Chain. ;-)  And, they have vegetarian choices, so that is even an extra bonus to me!!!",

The fact of the matter is the price and substance you get just does not pan out.   What I got:  the Shack Stack: (im not 100% if the name is right) but its the one that is the cheese burger and includes their infamous fried portabello mushroom stuffed with cheese. $9.95  this was alright but it was just TOO MUCH. I felt so heavy. the double cheese (cheese from the patty and cheese from the mushroom) was just way tooo much they should just have one cheese. It was small but surprisingly very filling. I would go back again for this but would never crave this....  Double shack burger: just a regular double cheese burger. No real special taste. just meh.... (IN-N-OUT Double double FTW! )  Cheezy Fries: i mean they tasted like fries.... frozen fries. and the cheese sauce on top was like melted nacho cheese. i just feel like i can get this at 7-11  organic ice tea: very refreshing. free refills.  overall,  ill stick to inn-n-out. :)",

They also have chicken patties and hot dogs as well as shakes! Definitely a just try if you've never had it. Lots of seating and it's a fast casual type of venue so you order and they buzz you when your food is ready.",

    "text": "Yay! Shake Shack has finally arrived in the West Coast. I love the Shake Stack, which is a combo of their patty and portobello mushroom. I also like the consistency and texture of their French fries. I was also excited to see that they carried gluten free bread! Yes!! I didn't get to try the bread because I ordered a lettuce wrapped shake stack. Yes, they do lettuce wrapped burgers, too!   If you're eating dairy, you can get their cheeseburger and cheesy fries! Cheese makes everything taste better. Though, I withheld myself and went for regular fries.   I also ordered an ice tea, which was unsweetened. I found it very refreshing especially on a hot summery day in Vegas.   Everything was great! The line moved quickly, the service was speedy, and the restaurant is clean. The ambiance is casual, and they've got real plants around the place. I also saw the Manager walking around asking folks how their dining experience was going. This shows me that they care about their customers. This place is, by far, superior to White Castle. However, as a SoCal kid, I have to say I prefer In n Out's burger patty and animal style fries.",

    "text": "Probably the juiciest burger I've had at a fast food place.  There was a wait during dinner time on a Saturday night but it wasn't too bad.  I ended up ordering a double shack burger, cheese fries, as well as a large lemonade.  They have two kinds of lemonade, one regular and a seasonal one.  I sampled both and the regular lemonade was far superior.  I usually hate crinkle cut fries cause I feel they don't stay as crisp and they get really soggy, but these weren't too bad.  The shack burger is just your basic burger, just patty, lettuce, and tomato.  The patty is cooked medium and has amazing flavor and it's really juicy.  The bun is a little soggy though and I wish there were more to the burger instead of just lettuce and tomato.  Everyone compares Shake Shack to In-N-Out, but I feel like it's an unfair comparison.  Personally I feel that Shake Shack tastes better, but it's double the price.  For a few extra bucks you can probably go ahead and get yourself a gourmet burger.  Also when you as for a refill they ask you to throw away your old cup and they'll get you a new one.  Pretty wasteful if you ask me.",

I've had many discussions (debates/disputes?) regarding the best burger chain and Shake Shack is always at the top of my list. Their burgers are just top notch: fresh, delicious, savory and full of so much flavor. Their juicy patties topped with cheese, bacon, peppers and stuffed into a potato bun is heaven. I never cared for crinkle cut fries because I always associated them with frozen food, but Shake Shack's crinkle cut cheese fries are addicting. When I want a good beer, I get their Shackmeister. When I want to add more calories to my diet, I get one of their many shake options. Always a hit, too.  This location's lines can get long but the service is speedy and you don't wait very long. Kudos to SS for their amazing food and staff.",

Their menu is larger and has more options, but is still simple and easy to navigate. I have ordered the Smoke Shack and the Shack Stack which is basically a Cheeseburger with a fried stuffed portabello mushroom. Omg yassss both are so bomb! If you want something spicy, get the Smoke Shack, but if you want to experience greatness, the Shack Stack is my go to! And of course you gotta get the crinkle cut fries. Sooo perfectly crispy I love it!   Besides the food, I have tried their shakes and their cold brew coffee and yes, I would highly recommend all of it! Obviously with better ingredients comes a steeper price which is fair. The best way I can describe this place is a midway between gourmet burgers and fast food. You get high quality ingredients (yeah none of that ice berg lettuce garbage), decent sized servings for a fair price. At In N Out, the food tastes just as amazing because of the spread sauce they use, but on a budget. If you're willing to spend $5-10 more for the meal, I'd choose this, otherwise you just can't beat the taste and price of In N Out!",

It was about 12am on a Saturday night so I was expecting some fast food.  Well as it turns out Shake Shack was close by and I had it bookmarked for the longest already.  I glanced at the menu and ordered the Shack Stack.    My burger was delicious.  The buns were solid, the meat was crispy juicy and tender.  The veggies (tomatoes and lettuce) were fresh and tasted great too.  Maybe I was super hungry but I thought this was one fine tasting burger.  The quality was definitely up to par with my expectation.  The fries were really crispy too.  I was very impressed with how my food was able to remain hot during our walk back to the room.  We kicked it all night just eating and having a nice blast.    The service was wonderful.  Being this was the first meal of my stay, I was left with a great impression immediately.  I knew this was gonna be a great vacation trip.  The place was super packed and it did take quite a while for my food to arrive but that's understandable considering it was a Saturday night.   Overall it was a great burger joint.  Probably the best fast food burger joint on the strip.    PS don't get the half and half though, I could hardly taste the lemonade at all.",

So, the line to order food went by surprisingly fast. My family and I sat down and waited until our buzzer was ringing. I took a look at our receipt and the cashier had charged an extra 1.00 because I asked for the cheese from double down fries on the side but didn't want the bacon or tomatoes. He thought I wanted everything on the fries but extra cheese on the side. About half an hour passes and it hadn't buzzed so I go to see whats happening and a huge crowd is around where the food is given. To shorten the story, since it was so disorganized they had given our order to someone else accidentally and that had happened to many people that night. Our cashier also didn't activate our buzzer so we never knew it was ready. We got our order and the fries had the bacon and tomatoes on them after we had asked them to change the charged cheese and put the toppings on the side. I love Shake Shack and it's food, but this location let me down",

But I mean if you had free parking I would lose $200 at your tables instead lol.  Anyways, I digress. Shake shack was quick and easy good fast service and the burger is outstanding. I got a double shack and fries. The burger melts in your mouth. Probably the best burger on the strip! The double and fries will cost you about $12.

Unbelievably amazing! The fries are crinkle-cut; they're delish. The shakes are super yummy as well, and they have many flavors to choose from. I got the chocolate peanut butter- yum! They also have hotdogs if those are your thing. Their loaded fries are great; I recommend those!  I am nothing less than satisfied with every experience I've had here.  The ONLY negative, (and that's if we're getting nit-picky here) is that it is pretty expensive. For 2 people it's around $35-40 dollars, easily. For me, that's not the end of the world considering I don't come here often. It really is a treat when I get to stop by and eat here :-)",

Shake Shack has a few more burger options and a ton of shake/ice cream/dessert options!  Located conveniently on the Strip,  we walked over from our hotel. The line is pretty long, but it moves quickly! I loved that the menu was on a huge chalkboard wall, which is great if you don't know what you want yet!  Service was really friendly. We got our food fast. Food was nicely presented and fresh! My BF and I each got the single Shake Stack, add bacon. We also shared an order of the crinkle cut fries and Black & White shake.

    "text": "Shake Shack 3790 Las Vegas Blvd S New York New York Hotel & Casino Las Vegas, NV 89109 The Strip  On one particular day while on vacation in Las Vegas, my mother decided that she did not want to eat at a buffet for lunch. She elected to eat at the Shake Shack. I never heard of the Shake Shack but could only imagine that it was somewhere I did not want to eat since I try to stay away from fast foods. I submitted to her request because I planned most of the other events during our vacation.  Upon entering the establishment, I could smell the grease in the air. I instinctively knew this was a bad idea. We walked up to the menu that was in the middle of the fast food lobby and viewed the fast food options. The foods were what one would expect from somewhere called the \"Shake Shack.\" They had hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken sandwiches, a mushroom burger, fries, soda pops, water, and milkshakes.   I'm a Pescatarian and do not usually eat meat, except on occasion. I do not like portabello mushrooms, so the vegetarian route was out of my options. I decided to get the Chick'n Shack (crispy chicken breast with lettuce, pickles, buttermilk herb mayo) and a Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake. My mother got the ShackBurger (cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce), Crinkle-Cut Fries, and a Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake.  We paid for our meals and handed a receipt, similar to Wendy's or Burger King. We waited until they called our number and retrieved our meals. I was not impressed by the presentation of the food. Not only did the chicken sandwich look greasy, but it also tasted as it floated around in grease for a while, and indeed was not crispy. The Vanilla Salted Caramel Milkshake tasted like a regular vanilla milkshake only half the size of a McDonald's milkshake. My mother did not like the milkshake and said that it had a funny taste. I told her that it was probably the salted caramel. She said that she must have missed that on the menu. She did not care for her cheeseburger or the fries.  Although it was not expensive for the Strip, it was a wasted meal in my mind, where we could have eaten once at a buffet and not eaten again that day. After reading other people's reviews of the Shake Shack, I can only surmise that those people are used to eating fast food and think that the Shake Shack is a step above McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King.  I would not recommend eating at the Shake Shack while in Las Vegas unless you are on a tight budget and are forced to eat fast foods. Instead of eating at the Shake Shack, spend your money more economically. Eat at a buffet once a day, the selections are more abundant, not soaked in grease, and provide healthier choices.",

From the cashier swiping your card to the staff pushing your food to you after you give them a buzzer, then asking rudely your name to id you with there annoying buzzer for a hamburger and fries, which they never asked for to begin with. The burgers taste like lard! with soggy bun. overall experience was bad. Oh, then there is the guy manning the drink bar. He even made a comment to me about the water cup avail ..is only for water, but then you see many homeless using the backdoor coming in with a used cardboard starbucks they pickedup  from the trash to refill any drink they want.--then they leave. OMG please gross experience.",

The fries are crispy and complement the burger very well. I like their concentrated, especially the Oreo one! It's thick and tasty but just a tad too sweet for my liking. The price isn't too bad and worth the portion and taste. In comparison with In n Out, I would say Shake Shack is a little under In N Out because of their sauce, price, and burger bun. Shake shack's burger buns tend to get soggy by the time I'm almost done with my burger. The sauce for In N Out burgers is more flavorful too.",

    "text": "My friend Patrick was right for once. We normally don't have the same tastes when it comes to restaurants, but he was right on the money with his assessment on this one. He told me to walk in with an \"open mind\" though for him, it was, \"just OK\". Well, even with his encouragement, this place is another victim of the hype machine. I've seen numerous food shows covering the lines, the madness, and huge fanfare that covers Shake Shack's NYC location.   So, you can only imagine how happy I was to find out that there was one in Las Vegas (not having to pay for a flight to NYC to try this out).   To be fair, since I've had In N' Out and Five Guys, I ordered the following to compare:  Double Shack Burger; good, juicy patties, seasoned well, unfortunately someone had a heavy hand on the seasoning this night as the flavor kept going, as in, it turned out to be salty. Otherwise, it would've been a great burger, even though it is a bit on the small side (especially for the price tab)  Cheese fries; crinkle cut with a cheese sauce. My favorite part of the meal.  Fifty/Fifty; which was just right, even though it might be a premixed drink, it was fine.  Overall, it is worth trying and a good product, but I don't know if I would frequently go here especially for the price point and overall value.",

When you wait in line they have a huge wall with the entire menu so when you get to the front you already know what you want.  Here you have to find your own seats. It's crowded but you will find a seat whether it's inside or outside. What was cool about their tables, they were made from an old bowling alley lane, which they branded on the corner of each table. Pretty awesome.  I got the single hamburger with shake shack sauce, cheese fries and a coffee shake. I love this burger! The patty was flavorful and the bun was just like hawaiin  bread, and the sauce...so yummy. Pair it with cheese fries, so good. they give you a wooden stick to eat the yumy gooey cheese fries. Even if you are full, the shake is just so yumy that you can't stop sipping on it. The coffee shake was so good, like creamy ice cream...yummy!   This is a must try when you are in vegas, but it kept us full the entire day.",

They are made from a potato dough and are absolutely delicious. The party of flavors with every bite is so satisfying. They have the classic burger and cheese burger options but then kick it up a notch by having the option of a burger with peppers and bacon. As we all know anything with bacon is amazing so make sure you try this burger choice, it's mouth watering good.  These burgers are sooooooooo yummy you'll want them for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  You know those mornings when you wake up with one sock on, and can't feel one side of your face? Well a burger from shake shack will bring you back to life with just a bite. Stop reading this already and go in and place your order!   P.s. Long lines as soon as they open and stay around until they close... Plan to wait in some kind of line- remember it's worth it!",

The location is very clean and calm not too loud although next to the strip. First impression was great. The line moved quickly and we ordered our food. We got 3 shack burgers, fries, and chocolate shake. It took about 10 minutes for us to get our food. The food looked and smelled great. The burger was juicy and freshly made. Crinkle cut fries that tasted great with just enough salt. We also shared a coke. I was surprised but not tasting the chlorinated water that I usually taste when going to McDonald's, In-N-Out, or Jack in the Box.   I rarely write reviews but this place was worth it!",

The line here gets pretty long and despite the large dining area, it's sometimes difficult to find seats.  I usually try to get here right when they open or just before they close to avoid waiting too long.  And if you are here with others, have them scout a place to sit while you wait to order.    My favorites here: ShackBurger Shack-cago Dog Fries with cheese on the side  For dessert:  Their frozen custard and concrete creations are delicious If you just want dessert, you can just go to the C-line outside to pick up your dessert on your way out after you've enjoyed your meal.  As for the long debated question, \"In-n-out or Shake Shack\"?  Why does one have to compare? Just enjoy each for what they are -- I like them both!",

If you're a fan of spice, you should get this! I do regret not ordering something else with lettuce and tomatoes though. Halfway through the burger, that bacon started getting really salty, and there was nothing to balance the flavor.  Next, I ordered a strawberry shake! Hehe... Or my friend did because he was up on gambling and was nice enough to treat me out. Hefty $6~ for a tiny, 3/4 of a pint looking cup. It was very sweet but still sooooo good! And I honestly needed that sweetness to drown the saltiness of the burger. If the burger didn't fill me up, that shake completely hit the spot.  Cheese fries, I hear from my friends, are also very good! $4 for a serving and the cheese is nice and melted.  Around $20 for burgers, fries, and a shake? I don't think it's worth it but when I'm in Vegas I expect myself to splurge anyway. But yeah, size to price ratio is completely terrible. If not to try at least once, come here for the shake! THAT SHAKE IS REALLY REALLY GOOD.",

I've been to the one in NY and remember them mostly for their featured lemonade rather than the food. I wanted his opinion on the infamous debate of in-n-out vs. shake shack.   Mind you, we had a rough night that spilled into the morning.. I mean it's Vegas.. lol. We get to the register and it's not busy at all. We're looking at the menu trying to decide what to get and I suggest the Cheese Fries but he doesn't give a yes or no answer.. He just kept perusing the menu and as he's looking, the girl at the register makes a comment, \"hey she wants cheese fries, if she asks for it, it means you should get it..\" OR something along those lines.. She didn't say it in a rude way or anything but it was just bad timing and the joke didn't resonate to the SO.. I get that she was trying to connect but it just wasn't going to happen no matter what she said..   The SO wasn't feeling it so he stormed out.. He felt it was rude for her to make that comment and also felt he couldn't read the menu in peace. So I continue to order the food and follow him outside.. He was very upset about how the register lady treated him and refused to go back inside.. Although I didn't agree with his perspective of what happened, I have to respect his feelings so I went back to request a refund. I didn't even have to explain the situation, just the fact that the SO was dissatisfied with the service, they not only refund the money, but they gave us extra fries as an apology. I rated them high just for that..  I subtracted a star because I do agree that the comment made was unnecessary, the seasonal lemonade wasn't as good as the one I had in NY and because In-n-Out does win the taste test overall in the end.",

I would of preferred a salad or something else besides fries.  Although my burger was very salty, it was good. The bun was surprisingly the best part of it.  I would of enjoyed more menu options even vegan/ vegetarian. Its great they offer a glutten free  bun tho!",

My Shake Shack burger was flipped in Las Vegas, where they are located just outside New York, New York.  I fully expected a long line up but here's a tip: go late!  We ended up going at around midnight and there was no line up and lots of table space for my group of 8 and myself.  I tried just a regular shack burger with the mint cookies & cream shake.  The burger was pretty good; I am all about the brioche bun, and minimal toppings.  The only downside is that there was (American) cheese (hello, why wasn't it called a shack cheeseburger?!), of which I am not a fan, so I ended up having to scrape it off and that took a fraction of a point off my rating.  The shake was thick and lots of flavour - sooo good! But I could even only drink half of it.  (I really gotta stop eating late).   I hope to go again, and this time I will try the Shroomburger.",

Taste Beef for both are well seasoned, but In-N-Out wins for having a perfectly toasted bun.  Shake Shack's was soggy.  Presentation Relatively comparable in terms of paper wrapping, but Shake Shack's patty was bigger.  Value In-N-Out is about half the price of Shake Shack.  Winner - In-N-Out.   I don't mind paying more to get better quality or taste, but it didn't seem like SS was offering me either of those things.",

    "text": "You have no idea how long I've been waiting to try Shake Shack. I've always envied my boyfriend who gets to go to NYC to visit his family for annual summer trips and I would always hear great things about Shake Shack. Ever since I heard that Las Vegas was going to be a new home for the franchise on the West Coast, I just knew that I had to get here!  So for starters, we came during a weekday so the crowds weren't that busy. We were able to get our orders down and find a table easily. However, for sure the weekends will be much more busier. But other than that, when you walk in, you will just order at the cash register and they will give you a buzzer while you take some time to flag a table to sit and wait.  We ordered:  1. ShackBurger: It's your basic cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and delicious sauce. My bf, being the Shake Shack guru he is, said that the meat patty was lacking a bit, but overall the sides and drinks were just as delicious as the ones in NYC (4/5)  2. Shroom Burger: I'm not a vegetarian, but I was definitely craving for this one after reading positive reviews. It's crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with ooey-gooey delicious cheeses with lettuce and tomato. SO GOOD! (5/5)  3. Cheese Fries and Regular fries: I love the crinkle cut fries! I just wish there were more cheese sauce for the cheese fries - but overall, you can't go wrong with any of these. Very delicious! (5/5)  4. Peanut Butter Malt Shake: My bf swears that this is the best he has ever tasted. He says that it is very comparable to the one from NYC. So yay! (5/5)  5. Peach Lemonade: Very refreshing AND you get free refills! Nice! (5/5)  Prices can be a bit steep, but the food here is good. Until then, I wouldn't mind coming here again to get my Shake Shack fix!",

    "text": "Luckily, I was able to try this place when it wasn't too busy. I was sad to have missed it while I was in NY, so I couldn't pass it again.   I highly recommend getting the Shack Stack. It pretty much sums up the whole Shake Shack experience and you can totally forget about the rest of the list. The buns here are soft and cut half way through like a Bao. The angus beef patties are cooked medium topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato and their signature combo, a fried cheese stuffed portobello mushroom. Every bite was a flavor bomb! You can't miss out! ($9.49)  If you're wondering about the SmokeStack... It was just okay. I didn't really like the grilled cherry peppers. It didn't complement the bacon as I thought it would. The bites weren't as cheesy or juicy as the Shack Stack. Instead it was a bit dry. (single $6.69/double $9.49)  I also tried mixing the vanilla and chocolate milk shake. Nothing special. ($5.25)  The crinkle fries were a decent size and crispy but not wow. It would've been better with the cheese. (plain $2.95/ cheese $3.95)  My only complaint is the price to food ratio. Yes, I get it! It's the only Shake Shack in the West Coast. We welcome it! But, for the price you are paying (Vegas price), I could've had a gourmet burger that's 2-3x the size. The burgers here are way too small to really fill you up. That is unless you load up on their fries and other menu items. Now, I know I didn't come here for the fries! Not after all the hype... And especially when you have hungry tourists waiting for 40+ mins in 100+ degree weather. It can be very disappointing.   Let's just say its like an itch/craving that you have but you didn't satisfy it. It's good to have checked it off my list. Thank you Vegas!",

Kinda like In and Out in the west.  Ordered a Shake Shack original, plus crinkle fries. Meat was a perfect medium and very juicy. You can actually see the meat, unlike In N Out with its skinny patties. Buns are nice and soft, cheese nicely melted. Fries are winners. Crinkle cut and super crispy, its my favorite.  I think I still like Five guys over this, but def SS is better than In N Out.   Bring your patience because there is a looooong line. A plenty of people. And to the fatty that demanded i say excuse me to her because i \"bumped into\" her.... you were saving a seat and calling your other fatty friends. I manuevered around you with a full tray of food with me. You decided to spin around and i literally felt your elbow make more contact with me just to make it more dramatic. Whose fault? If you didnt move into my path, all would be well and you would be scarfing down your burger when you clearly shouldnt be. Have a good day, maam.",

    "text": "After cleaning up at the tables and pulling in $20K as part of an all-night bender, I was mad hungry. With stacks in hand, I wanted to eat a stack at the booty shack.  I've heard good things about this place from my cousins who have been to the one in NY.  So for weeks I've been highly anticipating this meal when I touched down in Vegas. Day 2 of our trip, we trekked down the strip from our hotel to get there for the opening at 11a. Smart choice as soon after we found a table, the place filled up within 20 minutes.   As a True burger connoisseur, I always go for the 2 patties or more.  Smokestack was my choice of burger. Cheese, meat, bacon: How can you go wrong? I was happy with my decision as the burger was juicy and full of flavor.  The only problem was with my big mouth (literally & figuratively) I devoured the burger in about 5 bites.   I regret not ordering another one as I was not completely full. The crinkle cut fries tasted better than I expected given my position regarding crinkle cut.  The jackpot was a jackpot of a dessert. The waffle bites were an interesting element into the frozen concoction. The strawberry puree and cookie dough bites in the vanilla custard all worked in harmony. I didn't care for the sprinkles. For a double, I found the size of the dessert to be rather small (words that have never been said to me in the bedroom).   Bottom Line: This is better than 5 Guys, The Habit, Smashburger, Fatburger, In & Out and almost any burger chain I've tried. If your in the area, check out this burger joint.",

    "text": "Shake Shack: A personal retrospect of how it managed to win me over from In N Out.   *Disclaimer - It is inevitable to compare this place to In N Out, please continue reading at your discretion.    Ever since my trip to New York back in 2011 I have only dreamed of having Shake Shack again so when the news spread that there was one opening in Vegas, I knew this was my chance. Before I've eaten here, In N Out held the throne as the best fast food burger you could get. After many postponements, I finally made a trip out to Vegas with a few Yelp friends. I knew our first stop was going to be Shake Shack no matter what since it thankfully closes late. After checking into the hotel and dropping our luggage off, we headed to the New York New York hotel.   The restaurant is located on the strip with a huge sign so it is really hard to miss. We arrived around 1:30 am and there was no line at all which was nice since we were all famished! The burger menu is fairly straightforward, there is the original ShackBurger which is their standard cheeseburger, the Smokeshack which has bacon and chopped cherry peppers or you can opt for a vegetarian option with the 'Shroom burger. If you are feeling really adventurous you can get the Shack stack which is the 'Shroom with the standard cheeseburger. Besides burgers they offer hot dogs, a variety of dessert items as well as craft beer and wine!     Since I've already looked through the menu countless of times, I decided to go all out and get the Smokeshack burger with a double patty with an order of cheese fries and the fifty/fifty drink which is half lemonade and tea. The cashier was very friendly; I wonder how much they make. I think the best customer service for fast food places are in no particular order: In n out, Chick-fil-a and Shake Shack.   When you finish ordering, you get a buzzer to wait for your order; from here you can choose to find a place to sit at the vast interior or outside. It is nice that they have more than just the conventional seating of booths or tables, but also a few large lounge chair seating available. I sat down and waited anxiously for my buzzer to go off like if I held the winning lotto ticket. The wait seemed like forever but finally it was my turn to head to the counter to pick up my order. Walking back to the table shaking with anticipation I finally took a big bite after 4 long years of waiting and I can only describe it as THE ideal burger to which all burgers should be judged upon, it is THAT GOOD. Where to start? The buns are potato roll that is SUPER soft. Like In N Out, only FRESH ingredients are used to ensure the best taste from the crisp lettuce, tomato, pickle and onions, there is no trickery here. So what makes this place the king of all burgers? The patty. The patties here are larger than In N Out and not as smothered in sauce and super juicy. Combined with the bun, cheese, pickle and onions and last but not least BACON every bite is like a party in your mouth. I am also a fan of crinkle cut fries; there is just something about the ridges and the crispiness to it that a regular fry cannot achieve. Smother it in cheese and you got a clear winner.   Needless to say that every bite of the burger was just as delicious as the first by the time I finished it I was craving another. It's so good if fact that I came here a SECOND time before I left because I missed the awesome goodness. Scrolling through the more negative reviews, I realized that many people have a common complaint which is the price. I understand how this can be a concern but it's not like you are eating it every day. This burger is better than most sit down restaurants and you are paying equally if not more to eat a burger there so I don't understand the complaint. If there was a Shake Shack locally to where I lived, I would be happy to indulge in it maybe once a week or every other week and I'm sure it is not going to break the bank.   Well, if you have made it this far down the review then I congratulate you. 5/5, 10/10, whatever your grading scale is, this place takes it EASY.   For a TL;DR version - The best burgers that I have ever eaten, EVER.",

Also, my sister highly recommended it since she tried it when she went to Vegas several weeks before I went.  It's located in the New York, New York hotel.  I was staying at the Monte Carlo like right next door to NY NY, so I was able to visit this place several times, since it was close by.    I loved the burgers!  It was just so tasty, especially the meat patty.  The Shake sauce tasted good.  The veggies in the burgers were cut thick and fresh!  The crinkle cut fries were good too.  I also tried the Cookies N' Chocolatey Cream (special flavor) custard in a cone-that was so good!  You can check the website to see the calendar to preview what upcoming special flavors there will be.  They have different special flavors every week.  It is a bit pricey in my opinion (almost $15 for a burger, fries and a soft drink), but it is located in Vegas, so everything in Vegas is expensive.  They don't have combo meals, you buy everything seperately.  They serve alcohol (beer & wine) here, but I didn't try it because I was already buzzed by the time I came here late at night.   I've passed by this location several times and I've seen lines out the door.  But luckily, during the times when I went, there was no lines, and we didn't have to wait very long for the orders.  They will give you a pager and buzz you when your order is ready.  Customer service was really good-since it was my first time, they explained about the different items they offered.  I wish there was one back home in Seattle.  I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas!",

Decent quality ingredients that rivals your typical quality grill joint. Best? No. Decent? Yes. I did like the sport peppers that they had though. Long, thin peppers that are similar to peppercinis in flavor.   The standout for me were the fries. Crinkle fries that were crispy throughout and not too potatoey. Loved them.   Outside of that, I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be craving this so this likely won't be on the destination list when we're back in Vegas. So many other food options to try here.",

    "text": "Wow my new fav casual & quick burger joint (insert heart eyes). I saw tons of Shake Shacks in Washington DC when I went some few summers ago but never got the chance to try out their food! I go to Vegas often and was thrilled to see that they finally opened one right on The Strip! It's located right outside of New York New York by the bridge. You can either order inside or outside the restaurant. Outside would probably be quicker if you're not looking to actually sit down and properly dine somewhere cool. My party and I decided to eat inside since it was summer in Vegas.... AKA 100 degrees and up.   There is a large menu plastered up front right when you walk in the restaurant. You then wait in line for your turn to order at the front also. Then they give you a buzzer so you can go retrieve your tray of food when it's ready. The line was long when I went but it moved by quickly! Although it was crazy busy, the cashier who helped me was fun & patient, but was also efficient! You can get water and condiments on the side by the registers. You have to find your own table! They have lounge areas near the back of the restaurant and also regular tables.   I got the single shack burger which is just a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and tomatoes. It was delicious! They have their very own sauce that makes the burger taste kind of buttery, but not too overwhelming with butter. The cheese fries are to die for. Their cheese sauce is really perfection!!! Usually when I order cheese fries from other places, the cheese gets tiring and hardens up quickly, but with Shake Shack's cheese sauce..... Holy moly I'm craving it. Their crinkle cut fries were also really good, with or without cheese! I also got the black and white shake- it was so so. It tasted more like a chocolate shake to me; I'm not really into any type of chocolate dessert by itself so I didn't really like it.   Nonetheless, Shake Shack is the place to go if you want a nice affordable burger in Vegas.",

    "text": "It was first time to visit and try shake shack burger. I ordered shake shack burger with extra lettuce and french fries. It costs was kinda bit pricey than I thought cuz I'm from California and In-n-Out is quite cheaper than Shake shake. But overall  I enjoyed to have it. Patty was so juicy and burger bun was soft.  Usually In-n-out burger uses lots of sauce on their burger but I couldn't even taste Shake Shack burger sauce which was good tho. I cannot say or don't want to say which is better. If you never try this burger before try it! You will love it.",

He told me all the other Shake Shacks are in the east coast and that we had to try this place out. So after a few minutes of deciding whether I want to walk from Vdara all the way here.. We did it.   I had their Shack Burger, a hot dog and some cheese fries. Surprisingly, you get some really good value here. Especially out of the fries.. I believe they're only $3.50 or so, and they were pretty damn good! Very very good.   You know that feeling when you're hungry and you just order lots off the menu, but don't finish it? Well, I ordered a lot and ended up finishing all. The food tasted that good and I just couldn't help but killing everything.   I highly recommend coming here if your hotel isn't too far and you don't mind walking here, or hell just come here because it's that good.",

While I'm a hardcore, SoCal In-N-Out aficionado, I also appreciate the unique flavors & textures of the Shroom Burger (breaded and deep-fried cheese-stuffed portobello goodness!).   Came into Vegas to fulfill my 33rd Shake Shack birthday wish and Team Member Diane graciously provided us with a Birthday custard (with sprinkles!) and was serenaded by the surrounding tables. Diane also gave us some great insight about the new Woof Menu for our four legged furry friends.  THANK you Shake Shack for bringing it out West (was so excited when I saw announcements and photos via your Instagram and the grand opening at the New York New York Hotel!). Can't wait until you open in Santa Monica!!",

We ordered:  Shack Burger (cheeseburger topped w/ lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce) -we asked for no sauce and added raw onion, best tasting burger I've had in awhile!!  'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, & ShackSauce) -great for vegetarians, I took a bite of my sisters, very tasty, we also asked for sauce on the side.  Cheese Fries (fries topped w/ special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce) -Crispy fries w/ melted cheese, YUM!!! Get it!!  Jackpot (vanilla custard, belgian waffles , strawberry puree, marshmallow sauce, and rainbow sprinkles) -Meh, it was not my fave. we took couple of bites and decided to toss it.   FYI- Shake Shack will be opening in West Hollywood in 2016 :)",

I got the ShackBurger with pickles and onions, and their crinkle cut cheese fries. The burger was moist and the toppings were fresh, and you can just never go wrong with cheese fries. In addition, I have to say that the burger is actually visually appealing as well.  Service: Line seemed long, but every one was being served fairly quickly.  Value: Prices were good. The burger was $5.29 and the cheese fries were $3.99.   Ambiance: Nicely designed. More \"upscale\" than your local In-n-Out for sure, but I would rather go to In-n-Out every time!",

We wanted to try a variety of items so we ordered the ShackBurger, SmokeShack, Chick'n Shack, Chocolate Milkshake and Shack Attack.   I enjoyed all of these items but my favourites would have to be the Shack Attack (chocolate-y goodness!) and ShackBurger, which is the original burger that you typically see on social media. The portions were huge and the ingredients were good quality and fresh. The Shack sauce which is added on each burger is a must-try!  I also enjoyed the atmosphere here - they were playing a playlist of songs from 2010, and it made me feel so nostalgic. The restaurant is roomy enough that we are able to find seats for our entire group. We sat in a booth, and it was the perfect spot to chill after a long day of travelling. I'm happy that I made the visit to go here, as this will be a memory of mine for years to come!",

Something about the way they make their burgers. The cheese they use is perfect, meat melts in your mouth, buns are perfectly made! Easy and simple ingredients for such a delicious burger.   I'm also a huge fan of their bacon cheese fries and ginger raspberry lemonade. Without a beat I get the same thing every time and it never disappoints!

Because there's always a line anytime during the day. If you have a special player's card, you do get a separate line. Perks of being a baller, I guess.  I've tried the single shake burger, the chick'n stack, and fries. The patties are actually decent sized, so I don't feel the need to double up on the meat. The burgers are pretty simple - lettuce, tomato, cheese, and their sauce. If I had to choose between the burger or the chicken, I'd definitely go with the burger. The chick'n stack was $7 and reminded me of Burger King's chicken sandwich. Not worth it. Stick with the burger and fries. The fries can be a hit or miss, but if you do happen to get a fresh batch, they're really good!  Besides the typical burgers, they have so much more options on the menu. Hotdogs, cheese fries, custards, etc. Must make room next time to try the infamous concretes. Can't make my way to New York just yet, but thank goodness LV has not one, but two locations now!",

One of the best parts of this burger is the crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese, so good! 2. Chick'n Stack - The breaded fried chicken was perfect!  It was a good fried chicken burger, however, the shack stack still wins the gold.  We got cheese fries and regular fries with our burgers. Fries are good on their on - I don't think there was a need for the nacho cheese topping.    So glad Shake Shack is on the west coast!!",

    "text": "Been here a few times and their burgers are nothing too special really. Everything here is a bit over priced. On one of my trip my family and I ordered about 10 burgers and some other stuff. They did not label the food nor did they tell us what was what. As we were trying to figure out whose burger is whose, we realize we were missing a burger as well. We had to get someone over to tell us what was what and how we were missing a burger. Thankfully it wasn't too complicated and they made one for us. Service was mediocre and when I was ordering the cashier look like she wanted to go home already and had a dead mood. The burger were very small and definitely did not fill me up. Don't get me wrong the burger isn't bad or anything some people really enjoy it, but I feel like it is really basic and would rather have in n out. I definitely recommend getting the shack stack burger. It is very pricey but probably better than the rest and is unique with that mushroom filled with cheese. The bacon cheese fries is also good and a good portion.  Price: $6-$11  Parking: Parking is free for 60 minute at New York structure which is a 5-10 minute walk.   Service: Terrible. Staff doesn't seem excited to serve you or assist you with anything. Does not give any recommendation or even smile at you.  Seating: Indoor and outdoor. There is like 1-2 table that will fit party of 10-12  Pros: Unique Mushroom Cheese Burger It is popular  Cons:  Long Lines Terrible Service Overpriced burger Small Portions Simple common burger  Would I recommend: I would recommend to try once only",

During the inaugural (and maybe after) season for the Vegas Golden Knights, they have a deal called the Hattrick Special. It's a burger, fries, and drink for about $18 all in. The fact that it costs $18 and they wouldn't let me upgrade my soda into a beer is the only reason I dropped a star. Oh right, you also get a hockey puck as part of the special!  The taste of the burger is probably one of the top two fast food burgers I've ever had. Almost convinced me to grab a second, except for the fact that I was stuffed by the end. The fries were also tasty. Gonna just gripe again about the fact that I couldn't upgrade my soda into a beer.   As for seating, there is plenty of seating indoors. If it's a nice day you can also grab a table outdoors as well.  Fully recommended, and definitely will be back any time I'm in the city.",

    "text": "I'm not ashamed to admit it - as soon as I booked my airfare, I was dead set on hitting Shake Shack for dinner on my first night in town.  Really, it's like it was meant to be - flight arrives, check in across the street at MGM Grand, watch the Warriors game, head to Shake Shack for a late dinner.  Talk about the perfect plan!   Well, except for the part where the Warriors ended up losing the game, that is...whoops.  Attached to the outside of New York New York (and right by the T-Mobile Arena), this Shake Shack is by far larger than the other two I've been to (City Center in Philly and Midtown Manhattan).  Which is fortunate, since it made getting a table super easy despite the steady crowds (they have seating inside and out).  I had figured on getting their Double ShackBurger and fries like before, but after perusing the rest of the menu, I opted to go for something different!  -- SHACKBURGER (Single) - Cheeseburger topped with American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, and ShackSauce...$5.55 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=IuqhtFY9c5FZKl9KXC7aAg&reviewid=DeouFRFe-mp5Sji8O1ZlNw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shak...</a>) Though it may not have amazed like the first time, this was still quite AWESOME.  Between the buns, the juicy, flavorful patty, the fresh lettuce and tomatoes, and the slice of gooey cheese, this was super tasty.  The patty got a little oily towards the end, but this was still a fantastic burger (and seemingly larger than the one I had in Philly).  -- CHICK'N SHACK - Crispy Chicken Breast with Lettuce, Pickles, and Buttermilk Herb Mayo...$6.55 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=mAkplibTShvTNTD4Hx6Jbg&reviewid=DeouFRFe-mp5Sji8O1ZlNw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shak...</a>) Just a bit short of the ShackBurger, but still really solid.  Besides how big and juicy the chicken was, it was complemented nicely by the lettuce, pickles, and mayo - very classic flavors.  I liked how crispy the batter was as well, but it was a little thin and needed a little more spice/pepper to it.    While I still waffle on whether Shake Shack or In N Out are better, I can definitely say this - I'd more than happy to come back again and again, even though it didn't amaze like my first Shake Shack experience did.  Then again, maybe it's just because this time around, I didn't have the whole \"ermahgerd I'm finally here and it tastes so good\" angle to it.  Rather, it was more like, \"ermahgerd I'm so hungry and this tastes awesome but I'm also dead tired and want to go to bed\" vibe going on.  FOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now, at least until I can finally try their shakes and custards!",

I did get to try their Single PB Bacon Burger with pickles finally so I was equally excitedly.   The Single PB Bacon Burger... This stuff right here is the business. So Gucci!  We're talking a perfectly seasoned burger patty with applewood smoked bacon and a side of peanut butter sauce.  I spread that PB on that bun thicc like Rihanna!  The warmth of the meat with the hot burger fat makes the PB sticky and gooey but it just adds to the appeal.  Toss on some cold crunchy pickles and it's perfection!  The cold pickles works well with the hot burger, the crunchiness adds more texture to the tender beef, and it gave it a different flavor element.  I know it sounds bad but it works, babie!  Now I get why pregnant women do this!  And to add to the indulgence, of course we had to get an order of the cheese fries.  We ended up taking back up to our room at Park MGM, forgetting about it, got drunk that night, and drunk-ate it.  They were still good even with the cheese being cold and all congealed and stuff.  *kisses fingertips*  So while I may not show Shake Shack enough love here in Phoenix, I will never hesitate coming to Shake Shack Las Vegas.  Platinum and Black card M-Life members gets to cut the line by the way.  The staff here are super friendly and the place is kept clean.  I like it!",

The first two times I've been here, I had a ShackBurger, which is their cheeseburger. This is okay, and I was not in love with it and left Shake Shack not understanding the hype... This last time I decided to go big and ordered the ShackStack. It is incredible. I fell in love. The crisp-fried portobello filled with cheese \"patty\" blew me away. I am never coming back to Shake Shack and not getting a burger with this in it. If you like mushroom and cheese, make sure you get it. We also got cheese fries which is good, but I'll probably ask for the cheese sauce on the side next time. I can't wait to come back!",

The Shack Stack has the amazing cheese-filled portobello mushroom on top of the burger. It oozes cheese every time you bite it and it's awesome. We were also really happy with the crinkle cut fries. That style of fry can get soggy, but these were crisp from start to finish and they were seasoned really well. The only downsides are the prices you pay for a restaurant located on the strip. They're inflated because of the location, but any idiot knows you pay more on the strip. So you can't complain about it. If you want lower prices eat away from the strip.",

You already know if you're west coast repping it will be hands down In-n-Out and if you're over from the east coast it's shake shack all day every day. They both definitely have their charm and they both are definitely delicious in their own way.  But back to Shake Shack....  This location is located outside of the New York, New York Hotel, on the corner of Park and Las Vegas Blvd. Parking at New York, New York is first hour free, second hour $7. I think parking at the Monte Carlo next door was cheaper with second hour being $5. The place is always packed as expected. I love the design concept of the place though, big, open windows, wood finishings, very modern, urban design with a huge Shake Shack sign so you can't miss it. They also have huge tvs with sports games on inside.  I highly highly recommend the Shack Stack. It's your average cheeseburger but with a deep fried portobello mushroom in it. It's a game changer. I think what I like about Shake Shack is the buns they use. It's super soft with like the consistency of a Hawaiian roll but they toast it to perfection so you have that crisp outer layer to it too. Everything always tastes fresh and the burgers are oh so juicy. The chick'n burger is not too bad either. It's made with real chicken and has a great flavor to it. The Shake Shack Sauce is a light ketchup flavored mayonnaise. And if you're feeling adventurous, try one of their shakes here, super thick and creamy.  A definite recommend if you've never been.",

My favorite part of this restaurant was the self-serve triple filtered water. Everywhere else in Vegas you have to pay for water or ask for a cup but this place makes it easy! The menu advertises fresh never frozen beef and potato buns but Shake Shack is missing the made from scratch quality of In N Out. The burgers were average. Their beef just didn't taste very good or seem juicy despite being cooked medium. The concrete (shake with mix ins) was the worst item. The mix ins were huge and chunky. This thing has to be eaten with a spoon. The soda straws that were available were not suitable for drinking a shake of this thickness.   I tried this place for the hype but I rather have spent my calories on a Double Double at In-N-Out. My curiosity has been satisfied.",

Prior to coming to Shake Shack, I had just scarfed down tacos and a slice of pizza hence why I only ordered fries and a milkshake but no burger.  Fries - Probably the best fast food fries that ever existed.  Super Duper use to be good and maybe it's the locations that I've visited recently but the fries are not crispy and super greasy.  Shake Shack however, has the perfect texture, taste, seasoning, crisp factor, and I did not feel guilty afterwards, well I never do.   Black & White (Vanilla ice cream with drizzled fudge) milkshake - its hard to make milkshakes with the right consistency.  I was sucking pretty hard, my cheeks were starting to ache.  After letting it sit and melt for a bit, it did the job but I wasn't satisfied.  Overall, LOVE the fries.  Will have to revisit and try the burger.",

Don't know if shake shack out side of Vegas is cheaper but the one at NYNY is pricey in my opinion.   I got a side of fries, a single shack burger and a peanut butter shake was $16.00 plus. The burger was a size of a white castle burger which you know is not very big. The set up of the burger was similar to in and out but tasted a little different. In my opinion in and out is better tasting burger overall but it's a matter of opinion I guess. The fries are better at shake shack. There's alot of options for shakes they use frozen custard so it's very smooth and rich.   If you like over hyped over priced burgers then shake shack is for you.",

Drunk or sober they will taste good! I wasn't even that hungry and I ended up eating both sandwiches! I couldn't control myself with food tasting this good!   The Shroom burger is a crisp fried portobello topped with Munster cheese and cheddar cheese. On a potato bun with lettuce, tomato, and Shake Shack sauce. So good!   I also ended up eating the Chick 'n' Shake which was a crispy chicken breast with pickles, lettuce and buttermilk herb mayonnaise. So darn good! Since the girls I was with were drunk and not hungry I ended a eating both sandwiches. So not my fault!   I didn't really care for the crinkle fries but then again I like skinny fries. The thinner the better, and no I'm not talking about me! I'm not big on fries in general, I'd rather have a donut.   The Shake was just ok but maybe I needed to try a different flavor. I think we got a vanilla one.   While in Sin city calories don't count so stop in and eat your heart out!",

No smile no hi how are you no nothing. She acted like taking my order was a burden to her. Then to top it off the lady that handed me the food was the exact same way. I love coming here but man did this bring an eye opener to me. Never will I ever come to this place in the day time. I like coming here at night with the night crew that actually treat you with respect and it doesnt seem so depressed or seem like the customers are a burden. The people that work at night are more welcoming and happier..",

Shake Shack is notorious for its lines, no matter the location, and this one is no different. The speed of the line, however, was absolutely abysmal. From my time getting in line to when I received my food, nearly an hour had passed. The employees behind the counter seemed to be in no rush to move the line along. As for the food- it's Shake Shack. The burgers are tasty, the toppings fresh, and the milkshakes thick and flavorful. But for the price, a lot more is expected. So, I guess I was not disappointed in my visit, as I knew what to expect.   There's an In n Out right off the strip. hint. hint.",

However, I can tell that if you are a vegetarian then you'd love this burger! It was good for what it was. Also, the burger... looked perfect. Like it would go on an advertisement if that's something you look for.   The fries were surprisingly good given that they were just fries. Fresh, crunchy, warm, perfectly salted.

And honestly, onions make the burger SO MUCH BETTER. But they don't do them grilled which is pretty lame.   Also got the coffee shake and made it malt. Go. All. Out.

After a $34 price tag on 2 burgers, a small basket of fries and 2 \"concretes,\" which are essentially small sized cups of frozen yogurt comparable to Baskin Robbins, I was even more anxious to see what all the fuss was about.  Unfortunately I'm still not sure what the fuss is about. The burger was great, don't get me wrong--the portobello mushroom was crispy and delicious, the cheese was plentiful and the veggies were fresh--but the portion was laughable. This burger more closely resembled a large chicken nugget than it did a burger. The basket of fries was as regular as something you'd find in a school lunchroom. Not necessarily bad, but not spectacular. The concretes were pretty ordinary as well; a seemingly regular cup with a regular portion of regular frozen custard. The Belgian waffle bits added in were a nice touch though. Bonus points for originality, but I could hardly call my order a meal.  In short, if you want to try some great new flavors and have a wallet much larger than your appetite, give it a shot. If you're on a budget and you're hungry, go get literally any other burger.",

The mushroom burger and cheese fries are very tasty and their shakes compliments the meal very well. Place is always busy with long lines and often hard to find a seat but its worth waiting for since the food is so satisfactory.",

We all had the SmokeStack burgers with drinks and fries. The cherry peppers on the burger gave them a wonderful kick that I wasn't expecting. We shared a side of fries between 3 people and they were amazing. I usually don't like crinkle-cut fries because they always taste weird, but there were fantastic. Crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. And they have mayo in packets at the condiment bar!  Next visit to Vegas will definitely include at least one trip here.",

I prefer regular cut fries or tater tots. But the crinkle cut fries that Shake Shack offers were just OK. I could do without them on my next visit. I also got a mud pie shake on a separate visit.

So I decided to try their Smoke Shack (basically a bacon burger), their fries and strawberry shake. Their fries were super crispy and not greasy. The shake was creamy and perfect thickness. However the burger was ok. Tasted fine but nothing to write home about. It was $7 and it was not really big. At In n Out you can get almost the same size burger for half the price. I personally would be upset if I waited more than an hour to eat their burger. I feel In N Out still has the best burger. The fries and shake were good here but I would not come back.",

    "text": "Had heard a lot about this place and I'm happy to report it's as good as they all say. Usually these places are overhyped and ends with a disappointed me, but not here. Fiance and I each got a Shack Burger with regular fries (gotta start with the classics on the first visit) and we also split the Shack-Cago dog (Chicago style hot dog... took us a minute to figure that out). The cheeseburgers were so good! Meat, buns, and veggies are all super fresh and juicy. Nice thick cuts of pickles, onions, and tomato so it's got a nice crunch factor. The fries are crinkly cut, thick and crispy, just how I like them. We could've passed on the hot dog. It had relish, onions, a long pickle spear and little baby chili peppers. I love me some original Chicago dogs from Chi-town, but this didn't really do it for me. We also got a chocolate shake, which we will pass on next time too. It's just a shake, no big deal.   A lot of people compare this to In-n-Out, but it's like comparing apples to oranges. Yes, the're just cheeseburgers, but different IMO. My loyalty will always be with In-n-Out, but Shake Shack is a very close contender. Can't wait to come back.   Tip: We got here on a Saturday right at 11 when they open and there was already a line outside the door. We were lucky enough to grab a table (one of us stayed in line while the other grabbed a table), but people after us weren't so lucky so make sure to get here early!   Sorry no pictures. I was too hungry.",

    "text": "Before I start my review I need to get something off my chest. People compare every damn burger joint to In-N-Out and it's a bunch of crap! Stop! I am an In-N-Out fiend and probably have it four to five times a month, but comparing a place like Shake Shack to In-N-Out is not a fair comparison because they're two different style restaurants. If you want a closer comparison, compare it to Five Guys.   I stopped by here in my way back to Calofornia from Zion National Park. You can see it while driving down the strip. The line was out is the door but seeing as there are no locations around Southern California that I'm aware of, I figured this might be my only chance to try Shake Shack for a while, as I didn't know when the next time I'd be in Vegas would be.   The line was long but it moved pretty quick. Their menu was very comprehensive and they serve all sorts of great food and drink items. They even offer dog biscuits. When I got to the front of the line, the cashier was very friendly.   My food came shortly after. Presentation was very nice. I ordered a Shack Burger and a creamsicle float.  The bun on my burger was spongy and delicious. The meat had GREAT texture and flavor. Cheese was gooey. The burger was fantastic.   The float was equally good. Perfect for the hot weather. The fries that I tried were really crispy and well executed.   What I didn't like were the prices. Even though they have a huge selection, serve beer and wine, etc., the prices are too high in my opinion. Just my two things cost over $11. If I had ordered my own fries it would have been around $15 if I can recall. If you order a beer or wine, your bill could very easily top $20. I thought it was the Vegas treatment but I've been told that that's how it is at all Shake Shacks.  So the food is excellent but the prices are high. I would definitely come back and eat here again, just sparingly. Luckily I don't go to Vegas that often.",

Their fried portobello mushroom with melted cheese inside is to die for. I never had something like that and oh my god, I'm so happy I was able to experience such delicious-ness. I wish they had avocado as a topping because that would have made it more delicious. And man oh man, their crinkle cut fries tastes so much better than In-n-Out fresh cut fries. I can probably eat a whole basket to myself but the burger surprisingly filled me up before I could even finish it. Don't let the small burger deceive you and over order!   The only con was that the burger was a little too greasy for my liking, making it hard to finish but it was good so I had to force myself to finish it lol. Also, their cheese fries are a disappointment. The cheese is the cheese you would buy in bulk to make nachos, you should skip that. Be prepared to wait forever though because the lines are crazy. Thankfully my friends ordered to-go for me and I didn't have to wait half hour-45 mins to get this delicious-ness.   When I come back to Vegas, this will be one of the places I must eat at again.

There was already quite a line and it was pretty hot already but we got inside and ordered pretty quickly. Once you order you get a buzzer thing and then you pick up your food when the thing buzzes.  I got the single shack burger along with regular fries since I didn't like being a fatass in Vegas. My friend got the double burger and cheese fries. When my food came it honestly tasted like a regular burger to me. The fries were OK at best (not really my preference). However, when I tried my friends cheese fries, I regret not getting them. They were good. Price wise was medium to expensive for a fast food burger and fries but it's understandable because it's in Las Vegas.  In n Out is still my go to for a quick cheap good tasting burger and fries. Not everyone is gonna agree with this!

There were people, but the line was super short, at most only had 2 people head of us. Yay for us!

Opted out of double patty at Shake Shack since that was $7.00. Portion and presentation were super lackluster, BUT they hella sold me when I took that first bite. GOOD LAWD. Literally felt like someone punched me in the face with bag full of godly flavors. I had to look around to see if my tongue was trippin' on me. The size might've been small, but fawwwk that is some deliciously cooked patty. But sadly the flavor itself couldn't save the fact that I was still starving afterwards.  Shake Shack is definitely good, but for the price- doesn't feel like good value for what I'm paying for. But still cheap eats in Vegas if you're on a budget.",

INO is better & more worth it  SMOKE SHACK   (4/5) - the raw onions were ok. Better if it was w/ grilled or chopped caramelized onions  SHACK STACK   (4/5) - the crisp-fried Portabello mushroom filled with melted cheese was yummy!  HAMBURGER - PROTEIN STYLE   (2/5) - Patty seemed a lil tasteless w/o the ShackSauce (in which I had asked for but didn't get)  - they don't wrap up the burger but instead they place it on a bed of greens - green leaf lettuce is good but it doesn't offer the crunch like the iceberg lettuce at INO  SS BUNS   (5/5) Shake Shack uses amazing soft buns (Martin's potato roll, toasted in butter) that's hinged to keep the everything in place in prevention of a burger backslide.  Mmmm the butter!!  :: OVERALL ::  The burgers are kinda small. Hence for someone like me I had to eat 2 vs just 1 to get my fill. Taste-wise -- it was pretty good (except the Hamburger). Value-wise -- prices are a bit steep. INO has the better advantage on the pricing.  Hmmm... would I come back? Perhaps since it is on the strip & I do want to try their Concrete Dessert.",

    "text": "Some people tell me how amazing Shake Shack is. And then there's other people who tell me how overrated it is. Well my verdict: solid 4 stars!    Everyone compares it to In-n-Out, but I personally think they are quite different. First off, the atmosphere. In-n-Out has the all-American fast food feel. Shake Shack is a bit hipstery with their wooden benches and fancier menu boards. They also have no drive-thru (at least not the one in Vegas). Second, price points. In-n-Out is ridiculously cheap, as all fast food institutions should be. Shake Shack's prices are higher up there. Not gourmet burger status, but close to something you would find at a sit-down burger joint.  Now onto the food. I would pay $7-10 for a full meal here. I ordered the cheeseburger. The patty was juicy, the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, the bread was nicely toasted, all tied together with a thousand-islandy sauce (not as good as In-n-Out spread though!). Simple and clean flavors. We also ordered the cheese fries. They were hot and crispy with a good amount of cheese melted on top. Overall, I would come back, especially if I'm around the NY NY hotel. But if I'm driving back to LA already, In-n-Out at Barstow is the way to go!",

The chickn shack looked soooo great but was soggy, flavorless and small. The best part was the pickles.   The loaded fries are really just three single servings with cheese, bacon and the peppers. Totally skip them and just get normal fries. They got soggy quick.   The Shack Attack concrete came out liquid. I now today is hot but it's like I am spooning a shake. It wasn't mixed well either so the bits were all clumped into one monster piece. Flavor was great though.   Maybe the NYC or LA stores are better. Might never try now.",

When we got there, it wasn't super busy, but it had a long enough line for us to read the menu & figure out what we wanted before going up to order. I decided on the Smokeshack and the group got enough fries for everyone.  The fries were pretty good, but the cherry peppers on my burger just overpowered everything & just made the flavor of the burger one note. Now I love spice & I love heat, but not to trade off flavors. I had no clue if the burger patty was well seasoned, or if the bacon had any apple wood smoke flavor. For those in my party who ordered shakes, they said they were 'good', but did not rave about them.  It was ok, but I was not impressed.",

Simple and to the point, the burger was simple and very tasty, but the beef patties are paper thin. Thicken up those patties, and I would give them 4 stars. Fries wear nice and crispy without being greasy or having a greasy taste to them, so that was a big plus on the overall meal. If you really want a load of fries,go for the Double Down Fries. It's a big bowl of fries loaded down with Shack cheese sauce, diced spicy cherry peepers, and diced smoked bacon, and is a good share for 2-3 people. Again, burger size killed it or me, so I'll stick with an In-n-Out Burger for now.",

    "text": "More like 4.5 stars. As I start this review, all I can say is HURRY UP AND FINISH YOUR BAY AREA LOCATION.   First time trying Shake Shack, and the hype is legit. I'm a chicken guy, so I had to do the Chick'n Shack. My personal gold standard for a fast food chicken sandwich is Chick-fil-A. I'm a huge fan, so it pains me to say this, but I think I liked the Chick'n Shack better. I ordered it just like CFA's chicken sandwich, with nothing but the chicken and pickles. I thought all 3 components - chicken, bun, pickles - was slightly better in the Shake Shack version. All 3 ingredients (esp the pickles) tasted a bit fresher and just slightly higher quality. The Chick'n Shack seemed smaller at a higher price point than CFA's, so CFA wins on value I guess.  I'll also have to see if this was a one-off or a consistent thing once Shake Shack opens in the Bay Area and I can go more often. But on this occasion, Shake Shack won. And that sounds a bit crazy considering CFA only does chicken and Shake Shack is a burger place.  My wife is more of a burger person, so she got the ShackBurger. I tried a bite. We both agreed, it was a terrific burger. What CFA is to me, In-N-Out is to her. No burger beats an In-N-Out for her, but she said this time it was really difficult, even considering how much pricier the burger here was compared to In-N-Out. In the end I think we both agreed that for a fast food burger, we'd prefer the ShackBurger to In-N-Out. So in one visit we found a place that beats our 2 favorite fast food restaurants (In-N-Out and Chick-fil-A are really the only 2 fast food places we go to now), which is quite a feat.   Now, another reason why we like those 2 fast food restaurants is the consistency in both food and service that we usually don't get at other fast food places. So we are looking to eating at Shake Shack a couple of more times and seeing whether they can offer that same level of consistency.  If so, I can easily see myself giving the Bay Area location a 5 star review when it opens. I'm looking forward to it.",

According to a few news sources, this Shake Shack location is making way more than their Times Square location. I consider it a positive thing because Shake Shack has definitely left a mark on the Las Vegas strip.   What I heard through the grape vine is that it's better than  In N Out but I disagree. In N Out in my opinion is still the best when it comes to burgers and fries. I ordered a double cheeseburger with regular fries, to be honest it's just average in my opinion. Maybe I'm not a burger enthusiast but I still side with the food at In N Out.   The New York New York Hotel is constantly reinventing itself from a family resort to a hip and trendy hotel and I see it with the addition of Shake Shack.",

So I had very high expectations going into judging their food.  The establishment is pretty spacious and clean for a fast food-type of joint. There was a line when I paid a visit however there were 4 workers working the registers, so it went by super fast. I ordered the hamburger (with everything on it including shake shack sauce), fries, and a coke. Total came out to be around $10-$11. For that price, I was expecting the burger to be pretty decent in size. When I got my food, I was surprised. The burger was tiny lol. The produce in it was very fresh and the beef patty was cooked nicely, but meh it didn't taste as good as In-N-Out's meal for half the price. If you're going to order fries, get the cheese sauce!  The customer service here was superb though. A worker came by our table to take away our trash and to refill my soda without me having to do it myself. But overall it was just an okay food experience for me here!",

Here in Vegas for our annual March Madness trip and I finally had an opportunity to try it.  First of all, as other reviewers note, the line can be intimidating.  However, for Mlife Platinum cardholders (not sure if gold is on the sign as well), there is a special line that allows you to bypass the regular line.  Of course, you will get dirty looks from those in the regular line and you may have to explain that you aren't \"cutting.\" What I didnt expect was being rudely approached by a staffmember who immediately said \"this is NOT a line\"...oh really, then why does it say Mlife platinum? Her response....oh, all 3 of you have MLife?  I mean she could have more politely asked to see our cards if she questioned us.   But I digress.  The food - I had a Shackburger, regular fries (my hubby had the cheese fries) and a lemonade.  The night before I had a strawberry shake.  The burger is good albeit slightly oily, but I wasn't wowed.  Although I do love crinkle cut fries, these were just okay.  The lemonade was a little strong for my liking, but the strawberry shake was delicious.  All in all, it was a good, quick meal but I wasn't blown away by my Shake Shack experience.",

I don't have one in Reno so when visiting Las Vegas I had to return to try it again and was not disappointed at all.  Their menu is extensive (unlike In-n-Out) but I stuck to getting the double cheeseburger which was delicious, juicy and filling.  Everyone in our group liked theirs, including one with the chicken sandwich. I'm not sure if all locations serve beer and wine, but this location did...probably a Vegas thing but certainly a nice benefit.

It was like a nacho cheese but way better!! The shack stack ahh that was to die for!! It was a cheeseburger with mushroom in it with cheese melted in it!!! A must try!! We also had the chicken dog. That was so good too. It tasted sweet and so flavorful!! The prices were good too and there menu was big so a lot to choose from, this place is a definite must try. I thought it was just gonna be a regular burger joint nothing special but ahh it became my favorite place. !! Everyone try it!!",

Portions are small for the price you pay, but that's just my opinion. Service is friendly.  It's huge inside but hard to get a table if you're with a big group.  Worth trying if you've never been to one of these before.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off going elsewhere.",

It was pretty expensive for a rather small burger, and fries were nothing out of the ordinary--they reminded me the krinkle-cut fries served at my school's dining commons, which is to really emphasize how ordinary they are. I ordered the smokeshack burger, which was very disappointing because the peppers in it did not go well with the rest of the burger, in my opinion. At least the line moved quickly even though it was fairly long. But overall, I wouldn't care to spend so much money on a burger again when I can get a better deal and better taste at In N Out.",

There are usually line-ups that extend outside but we were lucky enough on a Monday evening at 8:30ish to have missed the rush. I must admit this is a well run organization from the staff constantly maintaining the place (wiping windows, sweeping floors), to the bus boy who was kind enough to let me there was free refills if I went up to the counter. Even having water on tap with plastic cups at the condiment counter was a nice touch.  As for the food itself. I ordered the double SmokeShack, crinkle cut cheese fries and their draught root beer. The double was a good sized burger with fresh ingredients and I was impressed the bun held up nicely without disintegrating. The burger was tasty but I personally found it overwhelmingly greasy (I anticipated greasy but not this greasy). It may of been the bacon, or it may have been the burger patties or both but I'm willing to give it another try. The cheese fries were a nice, unhealthy, albeit delicious side. Total was just over $18.",

    "text": "I finally got to try Shake Shack for the first time on a recent Saturday night. It wasn't an exceptionally busy night on the strip, but we must have picked the wrong time, because the line was out the door and about a block long. Luckily the line went fast and it wasn't that hot yet, so we toughed it. It also provided us with time to people watch on the strip. Just can't beat seeing a dirty Olaf with a man purse.  There were three of us so we shared two orders of fries. The fries were pretty good - definitely tasty. My kid got shackburger and the hubby and I shared the smoke shack and the Shackmeister dog. Overall the burgers and dog were good, but definitely not my favorite. I wasn't a big fan of the shake sauce - it almost had a cream cheese quality to it - maybe that's what in it? Whatever is in it, it's just ok. Also, the crispy shallots fell short. The young lady who took our order (who was very nice, by the way) described them in a way that made them sound more like grilled onions. The breading was just too much.  Luckily, there is a separate \"C\" or cold line so you don't have to wait in line for a dessert. We decided to all share the Shack Attack. It was good, not great. For one thing, the dang thing was expensive and the way they fix it, you end up with a giant hole in the middle of the cup. You seriously get about half of what you expect.  Also, it was supposed to be a concrete, but it wasn't that thick. Just seemed like a milk shake that was a little thicker than normal. I do have a favorite neighborhood concrete place so maybe I'm biased.  Overall, it was a good visit, but I'm not sure I'd venture back to the strip, deal with crowds & parking, lines and higher than normal prices for a burger. The In-n-Out down the street satisfies my burger need every time!",

    "text": "Beer Float is seasonal dark beer topped with vanilla frozen custard. If you mix the frozen custard and beer together to form a creamier drink, the flavors work well together. A more subtle stout that has more roasted coffee or dark chocolate flavor forward would work a little better. Otherwise, it was really good and reminded my hubby of his college days. Rating: 4.5/5  SmokeShack is a cheeseburger topped with all-natural Applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. The seasoned beef patty was grilled to perfection. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were juicy. The onions were not overpowering and had a sweetness to them. The cherry pepper was a little intense but it had a good spicy kick. The bacon, however, was a little dry making it both tough and chewy. The bacon either needs to be thinner and crispier or thicker and fried a little less for a softer texture. Rating: 4/5  Shack Stack is a cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger (crisp, fried portabella mushroom filled with melted Muenster and cheddar cheeses) topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. If you like steak and mushrooms, this is the burger for you. The fried portabella mushroom added a crispy texture, but once you bit through, the mushroom was just juicy and oozing with melted cheese like a mushroom popper. The beef patty was juicy and beefy. The bun was brioche-like and held together to the last bite. Rating: 5/5  Cheese Fries are topped with a special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. The fries were crispy and the crinkle cuts helped hold the cheese sauce on the fries. An addition of chili or bacon bits would be great options to add to the menu. Rating: 4.5/5  All Shook Up Concrete is vanilla frozen custard, Gimme Some Sugar banana peanut butter cheesecake, and chocolate toffee. The vanilla custard is made on premises and made with real sugar and milk from hormone-free dairy farms. You definitely feel the presence of Elvis while eating this! All it needed was some bacon. It was a great mix of flavors but the cheesecake was really heavy - maybe less of the cheesecake and more fresh banana. The vanilla custard was creamy and fantastic! Rating: 4/5",

The restaurant is right outside the hotel so it's visible on the street. We went there on Monday around 11:30am and there was a short line. Perfect!   Here's what I got-   I always get the Shack Stack which is a cheeseburger with fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheddar and muenster cheese! It's sooo good! Definitely worth the 770 calories! Lol. (4/5) I'm taking off 1 star because I recently fell in love with the Miyagi burger at Bachi Burger, which is a 5 stars for me.   I also tried the Shack Attack concrete which is a frozen chocolate custard with chocolate truffle cookie dough. Oh soooo yummy! If you love chocolate, you'll love this! (5/5)",

    "text": "Disclaimer: Being a pescatarian, I was disappointing in the limited veggie/seafood choices that they had. (But Tiffany, this is a burger joint, what did you expect?) Fair enough, although McDonalds' has filet-o-fish. (How dare you compare Shake Shack to something like McDonalds'). Given that I wasn't smart and didn't look up my options before hand, I'm not docking points for not having more veggie/seafood options, but rather judging Shake Shack for the items that I did eat. And my review will be more for those don't/can't eat their usual burgers.  I came here on a Friday night around 6pm; there was a decent line, and the restaurant was pretty full. I like that there was a HUGE menu that you could read from anywhere in the line (unless, the line is out the door and around the block). I ordered regular fries and a strawberry mint lemonade, because I don't like mushrooms. One thing that I liked was the buzzers that they give you when you order. This means that you can wait at a table and chat with your friends instead of crowding around the pick up area.   My food comes out pretty quickly considering how many customers there were. My friend ordered the mushroom burger, and because it was \"crisp-fried,\" it took a while to cook. I'm hesitant to say that I was quite disappointed in both of the items that I got. I feel like the shape of the fries affected the texture, so, the fries were not a hit in my book. The fries were on the soggier side as opposed to crunchy or crisp. The lemonade tasted watered down. I guess I expected something more sour or tart, but all I tasted as a slight hint of sweet lemonade.  I'm glad that I could say that I've tried it, but personally, I don't think I would come here. But I would recommend that other vegetarians/pescatarians who like mushrooms come try this place.",

Monique, the cashier, mistakenly charged me for something and had to wait for a manager to void it. I told her \"sorry\" it could've been my fault, her response \"don't be sorry to me, be sorry to the people behind you\" , in a rude way. So I spoke to the manager, and all he said to me was \"ok, I'll go talk to her\". Without even saying sorry? I love this place and all, but if they have their employees talk to customers like that, I don't think it's very professional.",

    "text": "So glad I'm using my first Yelp review for this:  Food: Over priced  Bland Most of the fries were too hard to bite through. Stale.  The cheese tasted like processed nacho cheese.  The shake was bland, I didn't even think that was possible. How do you make ice cream not taste good?  The only positive was that the patty serving was bigger than most, but it was a waste because it had no flavor.   The worst part is that it upset my stomach that evening and it gave my friend food poisoning. She couldn't even get out of bed the next day, except to use the restroom. It ruined the actual good meal that she was going to have the next day at Strip Steak. Shake Shack should ask them how to cook a meal.   Nobody else in our party liked the food much either. Similar complaints of substandard food and a ridiculous cost.   Never again. I'll stick with In-N-Out in the future. They know how to make an amazing burger every single time. My wife and I had In-N-Out the next 2 days so we could get the disappointment of Shake Shake out of our minds.",

There is just something different about a shake shack in your own local spot.   I was honestly teetering between \"A-OK\" or \"Yay! I'm a Fan!\"... but it came down to whether or not I was willing to endure the infamous LV strip traffic, driving through continuous construction around NY NY Hotel and Casino, then finding parking (or valet if you hate self-parking), walking through the NY-NY casino to the LV strip facing sector, and then finding Shake Shack itself! It may not be an obstacle for some individuals... but not for this little busy go-getting lady! That is a trek man!!! And this was with a husband who works two casinos down who knew the back-door ways!!! I cannot imagine if I didn't have a person to guide me through the crazy construction that was going on for the new courtyard area that MGM intl. is currently building out.   As for the food: if you are comparing it to the East Coast Shake Shack, it will DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINT! It did not sacrifice it's east coast famous flavor by opening a west coast establishment. I would even risk saying that it is better! They offer alcohol too (which the East coast one we went to did not).   Maybe I will feel differently after the construction is over... if it is EVER over on the LV strip...",

The burger was smaller than I expected. There was one leaf of lettuce, two unripe slides of tomato and a slice of onion. Meat patties were good size and good quality meat. Fries were so, so...

First, I always like trying out 'famous' places, and seeing as how this is a famous burger place from NY, that was originally drawing hours-long lines, I definitely wanted to try it.  Second, the shop is cool. It's more modern than a typical fast food burger, and it has a good amount of outdoor seating. The patio part is strip-side, so you can check out the goings on on LV blvd, but it's still kinda private, tucked away behind some bushes.  Third, they have a good selection of beer, including one from Brooklyn Brewery made specifically for Shake Shack (even though I didn't particularly love that one).  Last, but not least, the burgers, hot dogs, and fries are all good. They are a little higher priced because they're famous and this is the Las Vegas Strip, but it's not extravagant.   If you're in the area visiting anything at NYNY or across the street (Coke World!), I'd definitely recommend walking over to Shake Shack. And feel free to bring a big group!",

I've looked at the menu online plenty of times, I've visited in person and saw the smaller menu you could hold but cashiers please please let me stare at the giant wall version of the menu in store. I tell people to go ahead if there's people behind me but I always feel pressured by the cashiers yelling at me to go to them. STOP pressuring me.  With that said my favorite burger is the one with the crispy mushroom stuffed with cheese with the burger patty on top of it. The names here are confusing as all heck, they all sound the same. Shroom shack, shack attack, shack burger, shack stack, smoke shack I mean I just say burger with mushroom thing add some cheese and they get it.   My husband and I also love the hot dog. It's $3.25 and it's just a plain hot dog but they split it in the middle, grill it and the bread is so soft and good. This isn't a fancy place but it hits your wallet like its a fancy burger spot. However my stomach is so happy leaving here that it never really minds the dent in the wallet.",

Our buzzer went off and I picked our order up at the counter. Food was hot and looked good. The veggies, beef and cheese were all good. The bun was ok, I know others rave about it, but it wasn't my favorite. The shack sauce to me was just a color tinted mayo - didn't lend much flavor. Fries were good.

Every time we come here we order two meals and the total comes out to be over $30. This is insane! This is fast food! $10 for a burger is ridiculous! We've basically tried every burger on the menu and none of them stood out whatsoever. I would walk myself over to McDonalds and order something off the dollar menu and be satisfied. They have crinkle cut fried here which seems to be the thing on the east coast. The milkshakes are watered down and taste exactly like melted soft serve ice cream.

    "text": "First bite's amazing but it will leave you feeling heavy...  Stack Shack Burger - in addition to the patty, there is a deep fried mushroom that has melting cheese oozing out in every bite. You know that feeling when you meet someone new that excites you? Well this burger was simply that. However after a couple of more bites, you start to feel like it's a bit more than you can handle. Definitely something you eat once in a while.  The second time I came back, I tried the Shack Burger which is a more classic burger. Patty was juicy and packed with tons of flavor. My friend and I decided to share 1 order of fries. If you love fries like me, know that that was a terrible idea. When I saw the fries I told my friend I wish I had ordered 2. The girl working there heard me and gave me an extra order of fries, seriously made my day!  Now coming from California you know I'm going to throw out the In-N-Out comparison. To be honest I feel like In-N-Out's simplicity is easier to eat without feeling too guilty, it's also less expensive. In terms of the classic burger I'll stick with In-N-Out. However Shake Shack's unique Stack Burger is a winner in itself. It's something I'll definitely crave from time to time that I can't get anywhere else.",

The line to get inside the place was long which understandable due to the rave of \"New York's famous Shake Shack\" but what was unnecessary was the lady yelling at the line that she was trying to do her job. Secondly, OVERPRICED. Ten bucks for a sandwich that includes a bun and a thin piece of patty. Totally not worth my time standing in the blazing sun for. Lastly upon retrieving my order, I realized my burger was missing the cheese. I clearly ordered their new bacon cheddar burger. And I assume that the cheddar should be oozing out of my burger but nope, that didn't happen. My boyfriend kindly ask the girl that was giving people their orders, if we could get our cheese. She gave a disgusted look, rolled her eyes, and rudely said \"it's not my problem.\" ... Are you serious? Did I really just pay $10 for a burger that clearly suppose to have cheese not come with cheese?! If I didn't want cheese, I would have ordered a regular burger. Eventually she gave us our cheese on the side and told us to put it in ourselves.   Overall, no thank you. In-n-out ftw.",

The burgers are pretty small, so I would recommend getting two if you're making a meal of this.   The buns that are used for the burgers here are out of this world, and each bite really nails the \"meat to bread\" ratio perfectly. The SmokeShake does have a bit of a kick, so beware of that if you're not that in to spicier foods (it's not overbearing or intensely spicy, but you'll definitely feel it).  The fries are crispy and not overly salty, and ShakeShack so far has executed on consistency each time I have been.  The shakes here... just get one. Strawberry or the Black and White shake.",

I didn't realize that the burger doesn't come with lettuce and tomato until I received my food. I think the smoke shack burger is good, but not great. I think if they added lettuce and tomato it would've tasted better. it was too greasy/salty for my liking. yes, I'm aware that bacon can be salty but it was a little too much. the fries were golden and crispy. the shake shack sauce is good, but I like in n out better. I tried the milkshakes that my friends ordered and it was delicious~ I definitely wanna give it a try again when I'm back in Vegas.   service: there was a bit of a wait when I went. it was a Sunday afternoon during lunch hour. ordering was easy. cashiers were nice and friendly. the only problem was finding a place to sit. there were no tables available for my party and I to eat, unless it was outside but it was cold. we had to wait for people to finish eating and ask if we can have their tables afterwards.   price: decent, not bad. probably spent around $20 for two burgers, drinks, and fries.",

But if you're stuck on the strip and are looking for an affordable burger, this is a nice option.   I hope they work out the kinks of the seating. Tables were so scarce, you had a situation where some of the party would squat at a table, while the rest was waiting in line. This created the problem of people with food not being able to sit while people without food were camped out at a table. They need some kind of coordinator to help with traffic control.

But the entire burger was still heaven in your mouth, hashtag foodgasm. I also had the cheese fries, which were amazingly cheesy, similar to the nacho cheese and way better than animal style fries (sorry , In & Out)!  Overall, I really enjoyed Shake Shack. I really enjoyed the fried portebello mushroom with the cheese oozing out, which was the game changer in the burger game. It's definitely not Bachi Burger, but this place is somewhat a bang-for-your buck. Will I return? You betcha!",

The food quality is just as good.   I opted for the single Shack Burger - good size, bread is a little sweet, and meat was very flavorful - and a side of fries - really crispy and good. A friend got the cheese fries and said they weren't worth it.   Seating can be a little hard to come by at this location. You kind of have to hover around and swoop in when someone leaves.   Overall, Shake Shack is a solid fast-casual option on the strip - better than spending $14 on a burger at some of the fancier burger places, and better than eating overpriced food court food.",

Root beer float:  Can't go wrong with that.  Fries:  I happened to love the fries.  It was fried perfectly, seasoned well, and the cheese sauce was right up my alley.  Never met French fries I didn't like.  Verdict of In-n-Out vs Shake Shack:  Count me in as In-n-Out loyalist.  In-n-Out is fresher, tastier, and cheaper, too.  I like the fries at Shake Shack better, and I like that they sell alchohol here.  I fully enjoyed Shake Shack, so I'm sure I'll be back at this location next time I'm in Vegas.

I love the Shack. I've been rocking shackburgers since the original location in the park was the one and only. I have eaten at Shacks in Cambridge, DC, and West Hollywood. Never had a bad experience until today.  The defining technique and characteristic of a Shackburger is the smash on the hot grill to create that beautiful Maillard crust. But the burger I got today was grey all the way through. No crust, no contrast of texture, just a grey, mushy mess on a potato roll. And mine was not an anomaly. When I was waiting at the counter for nearly five minutes for my order (despite the fact that my buzzer had buzzed) I noticed one burger after another coming out similarly. I don't know if the griddle (which I believe are top of the line) was not properly heated, or the griddles were not properly trained in the smash, or what, but the burgers coming out today were epic fails. Extremely disappointing, Shake Shack.  UPDATE: Gave this location another shot this weekend, and got the kind of tremendous burger one can usually expect from the Shack - one of my best Shake Shack experiences ever, in fact. Updating the review to four stars as an average. Keep it up!",

Since the first time, I asked staff's suggestion. I ordered a shack stack, chick'n stack, fries and root beer. My sister modified the Shack Stack with protein style so lettuce instead of buns. They would call your number when it's ready. The food came out pretty fast. I loved how they served Stumptown cold brew and beer to pair with your food. I didn't set up any expectations before we walked in. It was amazing delicious for a fast food chained restaurant. The combination of mushroom and cheese worked well and chicken was crispy and tender. I loved the crinkle fries which were crispy and crunchy without any salty or cheese. Compared to the other popular fast food chained restaurant in Los Angeles, I preferred this one.   Only one day later, I already missed it. Hopefully I will see you again soon!",

I order a double \"shroom\" (fried mushroom patty) burger with cheese and fries... i can't stop thinking about it. I have absolutely no complaints. I actually tried them for the first time at a food festival (i think the employees were from the greenvalley location) and they were kind enough to make me a grilled cheese since they didn't have an vegetarian options so i'm pretty happy with shake shack all around.",

Cheese sauce from a can I'm guessing. Next time I would just get the plain fries. Burger is not huge, so price was a bit high. But again, we're in Vegas on the strip at New York New York. I'd get the burger again!",

    "text": "Probably pains my friend to hear this, but shake shack makes a bomb burger. Greasy, cheesy, meaty, beefy, oh just get in my belly goodness! Probably one of the best over the counter burgers I've ever had. I can see why this place is so hyped.  Got into Vegas at 12am. So hungry, what to eat? Oh shoot, Shack shack is open til 2 am. Perfect spot to grab some late night munchies. The soft potato buns are the perfect vessels for the well seasoned beef and gooey cheese to get into your mouth. I could taste some sort of seasoning from the beef or sauce. That sauce provided a creamy texture in my bite while not being over powering. I absolutely loved every bite of the burger.   But wait there is more! In addition to the fantastic burger they serve here, the crinkle cut fries were fried and seasoned perfectly! All the crispy edges and no soggy fries. Thank you for not fking this up. Probably the best crinkle cut fries I've ever had.   It's Vegas, so I had a beer. It was an IPA, paired wonderfully with my burger. Not gonna lie, it's kinda expensive for burger and fries. When compared to any other burger place(oh lets just saying IN N Out burgers), 1 shack burger costs almost the price of 2 double doubles.   I love their decors inside, it's very clean, and service was very straight forward and quick. I was generally quite hyped for this place because of my friends, but this place totally exceeded my expectations.",

I was afraid this would happen...Just like Earl's of sandwich in Anaheim, CA tastes nowhere as good as the location in Vegas. Saturday night and the line wasn't too bad. Good thing 'cause it isn't worth hours of waiting for this place.   I like that their menu is simple so you're not bombarded w/ a bunch of choices, but it's not as simple as In N Out.   Shack Stack - Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. I wanted grilled onions instead of regular onions, but they couldn't do that so I settled for adding crispy onions ($1 extra). They're basically the same onions as the Smoke Shack burger. The only thing similar to the original NY shake shack are the buns. The buns are pillowy soft and toasted nicely. Somewhat similar to hawaiian bun texture, but w/out the sweetness! The patty could've used more flavor for sure, but the portabello mushroom oozing w/ cheese was good! I was smart this time and waited for it to cool a bit so the cheese wouldn't burn my mouth lol  I was debating custard or concrete and they ran out of their flavor of the week for the custard so I decided to get the concrete.   All Shook Up Concrete - Vanilla custard w/ banana PB cheesecake and chocolate toffee. It sounded good, but wasn't worth the price nor cals. In case you're wondering, the concrete is basically like a Mc Flurry, it's a thick frozen yogurt/ice cream type consistency. The single was pretty small, I would say save your $ and go to Sprinkles at the LINQ Plaza for ice cream.  There are better burger places, do yourself a favor and go get Holstein's! Or In N Out if you want",

Their burgers weren't sloppy and I was a huge fan of the shape of their fries. Shake shack definitely has their own unique kind of flavor in their burger that other burger places do not have. If I had the chance, I would want to try all their different kind of burgers in their menu. Nothing special with their milk shake. I assumed their shakes would be very good because of the name of the place, but it tasted like a regular milk shake. I wouldn't get a milk shake with the meal since a burger and fries was enough to fill me up.  I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick bite before getting somewhere. Best average quality burger you can get in my opinion.",

We just arrived in LV from SD today, and for a late dinner we decided to go to Shake Shack. We went on Christmas Eve night around 9:30 and they were open. Also it was nice because there weren't as much as people I thought there would be. I ordered the single burger, cheese fries, and a strawberry shake.  The single burger honestly tasted a bit disappointing. I'm a fan of In-N-Out and their cheeseburger is way better. Shake Shack's burger have buns that look very greasy and taste very mushy and heavy. That really was a downfall for the burger, I prefer the light and slightly toasted buns, like the In-N-Out ones. However, the fries and shakes were amazing! The cheese fries were just perfect! Crispy and cheesy goodness. My brother got the vanilla shake, and it was good but the strawberry was better. Definitely like the shakes better here than In-N-Out.  Now the service was not so great. The guy that was taking our orders looked nice, but he messed up our orders... At first I wanted whipped cream on my shake,then after finding out you had to pay extra for it, I asked for it to be taken out, but at the end they still put whip on my shake and had to pay for it. Also we wanted 2 double burgers and 2 singles, but he charged and gave us 3 double burgers and 1 single burger. Literally the employee confirmed our order by saying 2 doubles and 2 singles, but still charged and gave us 3 doubles. I feel like he intentionally did that to us because we looked like foreigners. (We are Asian) Well anyways I did enjoy most of the food, but not sure if I would get the single burger again.",

Last Tuesday night, the line to get to the counter was moving very slowly which we thought was unusual- then the manager came out to let us know that they've run out of beef and the delivery truck got stuck in the traffic and will arrive soon. While in line, the staff came out with samples and kept apologizing for the wait. When we finally reached the counter, after ordering 5 single burgers, 2 doubles, 2 chicken sandwiches, 7 fries and 2 shakes, the young cashier told us that we don't need to pay and the $107+ check is on them. It took awhile before we were able to process what she said, then we said \"thank you!\" She replied \"thank you for patiently waiting.\"  ..... Thank you Shake Shack for our free dinner! It was all worth the wait! As always, the food was great!",

It includes one regular burger without cheese with onion, tomato and lettuce, one regular fries, no sauce, one order of a 'chicken hot dog' and one small non-sweet black tea, which they never asked me for a size preference. When I ordered the food I wanted to try something that had chicken in it and the hot dog was the only thing they have, which tasted pretty good in my opinion, it definitely doesn't taste like hot dog meat and more like chicken and not as salty as a regular hot dog. The burger meat was juicy and had the flavor you could expect, fresh onions, lettuce and tomato all in a firm bun. The fries, you'd expect to have been frozen since they're crinkle cut, taste better than what you would make at home from bagged crinkle at the grocery store. The quantity really doesn't justify the price in my opinion, and it is no comparison to IN-N-Out in price, because people comparing to them, which I can get 3 burgers and 2 fries for less than 12 dollars. However, the flavors are there, the fries didn't taste like they were frozen, ever, the patty was juicy and cooked well, all fresh ingredients. I will come back again one day to try out a burger with cheese, since I have to try it with cheese. The quality is there in my opinion and if you just want to try to just taste and not get a bellies full, then go to Shake Shack. The interior is beautiful, they play very good music, the colors are bright. My favorite part is the seats outside that give a view of the MGM hotel. All in all the place is beautiful in terms of the restaurant and the food but it comes at a price that is not similar to what you find at an IN-N-OUT, I don't fathom why people compare this to there because they are both completely different restaurant concepts.",

I've been to both the Shake Shack next to Central Park and in Citi Field. This one is probably the worst. It's a serviceable burger, but nothing more than that. This burger right now only has nostalgia purposes. Even the shakes don't taste like custard. When a black and white shake tastes like a slightly upgraded Oreo Mcflurry, you know this isn't where you want to be eating. There's a Burger Bar here, and honestly, I might as grab a White Castle slider if I'm feeling like remembering the good times in New York. Otherwise, I'd head across the way for some delicious In n Out. The two best things I can mention about this place are: the water mister outside and the scenes of New York on their panoramic display screen. And if you think them serving east coast beer is good, remember that most east coast beers (especially NY breweries) aren't very good when compared to their western brethren.",

    "text": "A LOT of hype went into this place before it opened, which honestly took almost 2 years. I believe I read articles announcing the opening of the first Shake Shack on the West Coast in April on 2013. I myself was super excited because I had a few friends who tried it in New York and they couldn't stop talking about how AMAZING it was and the fact that it kicks In N Out's butt. FINALLY it opens a few days before New Year's and low and behold my friend's and I are there on opening day December 29, 2014 a Monday to be exact. If I wasn't working that day I probably would of been one of the first customers in line, if not the first. I really wanted to write a review after my first visit, but I wanted to give them another shot before knocking them down. I'm certainly glad I did because I would of given them 3 stars instead of 2.  My first visit, there was no line at all which is good considering all the horror stories with 45 minute waits at the NY locations. I ordered the Shack Stack and cheese fries based off of everyone's recommendation from Yelp and friend's of mine. I was honestly not a fan and did not understand the hype from these menu items. To begin with I am not a cheese at all and both of these are bombarded with cheese. I do enjoy cheese on fries, but maybe there was a too much cheese on these fries. Maybe if you order these you can request for light cheese or even have it on the side so you don't get overwhelmed with cheese. The Stack Shack has the portobello- mushroom breaded on the outside with cheese as well. This is a really good concept, but once again I was overwhelmed with cheese because there was already cheese on the burger itself. If I order this again I may just have to order it without cheese on the burger since there's already cheese in the portobello-mushroom. I also ordered a medium size lemonade and all of these came out to $17 and some change. WOW pretty pricey I must say. So I was kind of whatever about this experience, but I knew I should order different things on my next visit and sure enough I was there again the next week on a Friday. We arrive around 6pm and there was line of about 15-20 people. The line moves fast because there are 3 cashiers upfront and a ton of employees working the kitchen. They seem to be over staffed, but I guess that's beneficial for the patrons eating here. So this time I came here with my cousin and we share 1 order of fries and single scoop of All Shook Up. I ordered a Shack Burger for myself. And sure enough I was way more impressed with my selections this time around. Since there was less stuff going on in the burger I could truly taste the quality of the beef in comparison to In N Out. I also do appreciate the fact they use a better quality ice berg lettuce. Definitely in this case you get what you pay for. Although I do like crinkle cut fries, I still prefer In N Out's because of their freshness. You could tell these are made from Yukon Gold rather than whatever type of Cane's uses for their crinkle cut fries. My cousin and I really enjoyed the All Shook Up. The consistency and texture was perfect and concrete itself was not too sweet. For the most part I can see myself ordering a shake, concrete, or a custard item on my future visits. Next time I'm here with a bigger group I'll order the Shake a pooloza, which looks amazing in pictures. Although it is a pricey for $15?!  Looking around here you could tell all of the patrons eating here are into the up and rising food scene and just life in general? Haha. I do like the interior since it looks like recycled wood they used for their fixtures and table settings. I know I won't take an initiative, but with visitors from out of town they'll be like \"I want to try Shake Shack\" and I certainly be hiding my excitement inside because I've already tried it.",

In our opinion it was just okay, not really anything special, especially not more special than my favorite California based burger chain ;) What we got: 1. Shack stack burger, what I liked about this was the fried mushroom, the burger was really simple and fresh tasting but the patty was kind of dry 2. Cheese fries, \"cheese sauce\" tasted like something from a can or packet, similar to nacho cheese sauce 3. Shack cago hotdog, liked it better than the burger, but the hot dog bun was really soggy and fell apart while eating 4. Concrete \"jackpot\" frozen custard, this was my favorite part of the meal, a sweet delicious combo of vanilla frozen custard, strawberry puree, marshmallow cream, waffle pieces, and rainbow sprinkles (I love sprinkles)  The service here was great and fast, and the pricing is very decent for what you get.",

The wait was no more than 10 min to order and another 15 min to get your food. Enjoy a beer while you wait!  My friend and I ordered the original Shake Shack burgers. Always gotta judge the place based on the og burger! I must say the meat was pretty thick & juicy, but the burger was quite small overall. The buns were a bit dense as well. I ended up picking 1/3 of it out. Also, I don't know how they messed it up but one of our burgers came without tomatoes and the other came without onions. Seriously? How hard is it to put in the basic ingredients to your basic cheeseburger. We didn't ask for anything fancy. Just the two original Shake Shack cheeseburgers. (This would never happen at In N Out. Just sayin'.)  Anyway. Idk how people wait HOURS for this burger. But. I'm glad I tried it once. So I have a right to say that In N Out is better than Shake Shack. Hands down. (But maybe I'm a bit biased).   Check it out if you're in the area!",

    "text": "QUICK SUMMARY: Overpriced Innout burgers that were worth the price at the NYC locations I've been to, but not worth it here. If you're already here, order a Concrete.   What happened Shake Shack? The Vegas location was all disappointment and nothing like what I've had in the past. After trying a Shake Shack in NYC I fell in love. You know that high definition TV inside that shows you really glamorous images of Shake Shacks around the world? That was exactly how it felt in NYC. There restaurant was elegant, the customers were all beautiful and everyone was happy and friendly. Vegas felt like a typical fast food hamburger joint with a nice attempt at being more, but nonetheless fell short. The staff behind the counter seemed annoyed at indecisive customers and the amount of time it was taking for them to place their orders (Yes, I know it was CES week and I'm sure none of the customers in line had been to a Shake Shack before and probably spoke English as a second language, but it's no excuse to be rude).  I don't know what I did to deserve it, but my hamburger came out FLAT. I wish I had taken a picture (the fact that I didn't take a picture meant it was really not Instagram worthy). It was as if someone squished my burger after it came together.  The fries were good- crispy and on the salt-less side. A+ for those.  I hope the new Summerlin location is better, because the LV Blvd location needs some work. See you in NYC Shake Shack! Vegas did not do you justice.",

    "text": "Born and raised in California we don't have shake shack, we have In-N-out so we wanted to see what the hype was all about.    First off, I don't think these two place are comparable at all.  Don't get me wrong, they are both very good but in their own ways.  For example how can you compare fresh cut fries to the frozen crinkled cut?  It's obvious the frozen will be a lot more crispier and light as opposed to the fresh cut.  There is also a HUGE difference in price.  A double double at In-N-out runs less than $3.50 and a Shack Shack burger is $9.49...that's 3x more!    We spent over $80 for a family of 4 which included the shack shack, shroom burger, shack burger, shackmeister dog, cheese fries, plain fries and three shakes. The food was fresh and a delicious and their bread was nice and soft but a little too soft for my preference.  Had they toasted it a little would have been perfect.  My family didn't think their cheese fries was anything special but their regular fries were nice and crispy.    You will also be waiting awhile to order as the line starts from the outside of the restaurant. The staff are friendly, there are plenty of condiments to choose from and offer free refills on soda. There is indoor and outdoor seating available.",

That time I ordered a chick'n stack and thought that Chick-Fil-A was a lot better. However this time, I really enjoyed my 'shroom burger. While my favorite part of the sandwich was the really soft bun, the melted cheese inside of the fried mushroom is really what makes it.   My boyfriend also ordered a single stack, which brought him back to his trip to NYC and we shared an Oreo shake and cheese fries. The cheese fries were good--really crisp and not too salty. The Oreo shake was standard and nothing really to write home about.",

    "text": "On the Las Vegas Strip right between New York, New York and the Monte Carlo is Shake Shack. People confuse it a lot of the times with Steak 'n' Shake--don't make that mistake. These two places are completely different.  The burgers at this place don't come with fries. And they're much smaller. And they're more expensive.   Upon looking at the menu, I saw that the SmokeShack burger (a cheeseburger with bacon) is $7 for a single and $9.50 for a double! I figure the burgers must be fairly big to justify such a price--even in Vegas.  They weren't. I ordered the double, but this thing was insultingly small. Oh, and when I asked what kind of cheese they can put on it besides American, the lady said that's all they have. Really? It's basically not even real cheese!  But despite all that, bites one and two were surprisingly good. I was digging it. The bun was actually really fluffy and buttery. And the meat--which was of pretty good quality--covered up the whole bun without any excess bread at the end. But the more I ate, the more the fake-cheesiness got to me. If it wasn't for the bacon to somewhat balance it out, it would have been a much more miserable experience--for nearly $10. And I was still hungry afterwards.  My fiancee had the Shack-cago Dog at a more reasonable price of $4. This one was actually really good, too. It was your classic Chicago-style hotdog with a nice peppery kick. Oh, and the french fries were addicting as well.  If you don't know good burgers, you might like this place. But after going to other \"faster food\" burger places, like Fuddruckers or Steak 'n' Shake, this place is a step above Five Guys and a step below In-n-Out (although the meat was better here). And I've gotten pretty tired of In-n-Out already.",

    "text": "I arrived here on a weekday around noon and was lucky enough not be stuck in Shake Shack's notorious lines. There were only about five other groups ahead of me, which gave me just enough time to figure out what I wanted to order. All four or so cash registers open so the line moved reasonably fast.  Shake Shack offers eight milkshake flavors, including a weekly flavor. For the last week of March/first week of April 2015, the flavor of the week was malted marshmallow. Overall, I ended up ordering one single ShakeBurger (their original cheeseburger with one beef patty; $5.19), one double ShakeBurger ($7.99), two double SmokeShacks (cheeseburger with two beef patties, bacon, sweet peppers, and no lettuce or tomato; $9.49 each), two cheese fries($3.95 each), and a black and white shake (vanilla with chocolate fudge; $5.25).  It took about 10 minutes for our buzzer to go off so that we can grab our food at the pick-up counter. The burgers were seasoned and flavorful, though I wish the buns were more toasted like In-N-Out's. Shake Shack's menu states that all their burgers are cooked medium unless you order otherwise. I like my burgers cooked medium, but all our patties were cooked well done. That's particularly too bad considering that a place that advertises themselves with default medium-cooked burgers overcooked each patty. I tried both the double ShakeBurger and double SmokeShack burger. I like a little heat in my food so I enjoyed the sweet peppers in the SmokeShack burger. Other than that, the ShakeBurger was better because the lettuce and tomatoes made the burger more well balanced. By the way, if you're a fan of onions, Shake Shack's burgers don't include onions... Lucky for you, onion haters!  I love cheesy fries so the crinkle cut cheese fries option is great. The cheese fries tastes just as you think they would - previously frozen crinkle cut fries with artificial cheese sauce. Good, but nothing super special about it other than it's not an item you typically see on west coast menus. As for the milkshake, the black and white shake was runnier and not as thick as I like.  Good burgers and cheese fries, but In-N-Out's burgers has Shake Shack beat in taste and price. I'm glad I had a chance to try Shake Shack without a long line and having to fly to New York. Would I wait here again if the wait was over 45 minutes long? Ehhhhhhh....",

A few of my friends think Shake Shack is highly overrated and some claims it's the best burger they've had! Well, based on my visit, I personally I think their burgers were good... but not out of this world good :P.   Love how their menu goes beyond burgers, which includes milkshakes, chicken sandwiches and hot dogs and all customizable to your whim (extra bacon, anyone ?). Also, no matter what time of day this place is pretty packed, finding a seat indoor might be a feat in itself. But other than that, the dining experience was very much enjoyable (compared to other fast food joint), with clean and modern interior.   For my burger, I ordered the single smoke shack cheeseburger topped with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and Shacksauce. The patty was pretty moist, salty and juicy with soft buns and I appreciate the smoky flavor and warm peppery kick in it.   We also ordered a side of crinkle cut bacon-cheese fries, it was an okay dish, nothing really special, but since anything with bacon and cheese is hardly ever bad.   The pricing was a bit steep, with my burger costing around $6.xx and they are junior sized burgers. Other than that, all is well is Shake Shack and I personally can't wait to try more of their burgers.",

Literally 15 minutes later it still wasn't ready. I kept asking for them to check my order finally they put it through.  The lady at the counter gave me free fries to try and appease me.

I adore a properly made cheeseburger. It is one of the things that makes life so cherished and beautiful. Being from SoCal, I have been spoiled as both In N Out and The Habit is readily available and now I have an east coast equivalent in Shake Shack. Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Inland Empire please be advised that the Double Shackburger is the TRUTH. The dual 100% Angus beef topped with melting cheese, crisp lettuce, tomato slices and \"ShackSauce\" made me emotional with every bite. I loved this burger.   The hand cut fries were no laughing matter either, a perfect shade of golden brown with a mouthfeel that would make angels weep. I like mine with yellow mustard and they delivered in spades. The chocolate custard was thick, smooth and packed more chocolate-y funk than a 360 dunk. I usually dislike sweets, not the case that fateful day.  Shake Shack is the business people. The hot dog is also very good - if not entirely exceptional - but to even mention the hot dog after the burger is akin to asking a hooker for a hug. The only caveat emptor is that the lines can be outrageous, but an In N Out fanatic wouldn't bat an eye and they move the crowds pretty efficiently.  I would love to have a Double Shackburger right about... now.",

I only had the sandwich and an Arnold Palmer. If you haven't been to a Shake Shack, check out this one and have the hamburger instead of a chicken sandwich. Unless you don't eat beef, then the chicken sandwich is good. :)",

They also took care of a couple well with a service animal who's owner was struggling with disabilities. They serve dog biscuits that are hand made, and have lots of seating outside where dogs were welcomed and had plenty of space if you don't. Also stayed and people watched for a long time abs seemed to be only pet seen.   Will be back too, as the cost was a great value overall and the food is fantastic!!!    :)",

This Shake Shack is in the New York, New York Hotel. When I first walked in, I loved how much natural lighting was in the space. There was also a lot of wood pieces of furniture. The space is beautiful! I always get a burger and fries, so I decided to try the chicken sandwich with an order of cheese fries. My fiance got a chicken sandwich (added bacon), fries, and a black and white shake. Again, the food was superb. Everything came out hot and crispy and the shake was amazing. I should have ordered one myself, and I definitely will next time I go! If you've never had Shake Shack before, you should go. Just do it... especially in Vegas because the space was beautiful and the service was quick and easy!!",

I tried the single cheeseburger, the chicken burger, the coffee shake and the fries. The cheeseburger was my favourite. The bun was sweet, there was plenty of cheese, the patty was tasty and moist. However, it was a little small; will probably opt for the double next time. The chicken burger was alright. The batter was good but the chicken was a little dry. Fries were ok, get them with the Shack sauce on the side. The coffee shake was not bad too; very rich and very strong taste without being too sweet.  Overall it is definitely worth a visit. The price was more than reasonable for the strip. Would for sure come back for the cheeseburger!",

People will endlessly compare Shake Shack to In N Out, and being a CA resident, my opinion is:  In N Out burgers are more fresh/light. Shake Shack's burgers are more flavorful/oily. Shake Shack fries are worlds better. No comparison. In N Out fries are weaksauce. Shake Shack does shakes/malts better.  You'll never get me to besmirch In N Out by saying Shake Shack is better overall, but I gotta admit, they win in certain avenues.",

    "text": "I have to say that this place is the one I always look forward to eating at (other than Eggslut) whenever I'm in Vegas. All the other locations are in Manhattan so this is the closest to us. While I love my In-N-Out and Super Duper Burgers, this burger joint is definitely in my top 5 for fast food burger joints in the US.   This Shake Shack is located on Las Vegas Blvd. at The Park outdoor area. It says on Yelp it's at the New York New York Hotel, but it's actually outside and not connected to the hotel. There's also another one inside the T-Mobile Arena which is only accessible if it's open for events.   The reason I like this location more than the original one in Manhattan is that it's super spacious. (Maybe because the original is just a \"shack?\") You can bring your whole family plus extended family PLUS close friends. There's also extra tables outside. We usually go early when they just open so as to avoid the lunch rush. Even if you get there at that time, there will probably be a line at the door. But really, the wait is short. They expedite so well it's like a well-oiled machine! Another reason I love Shake Shack is that they have other tasty options;  like their Smoke Stack, Shroom Burger and Hot Dogs. They also have a more flavors of shakes than other places including new seasonal flavors each month. My favorite is their Chick'-N-Shack; their version of the Fried Chicken Sandwich.",

We ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a shake to compare with our personal taste.   The burger seems snaller compared to in & out. The bread is softer and I found the patty to be saltier compared to in & out. There wasn't any sauce in it so I had to put my own ketchup. It's a little nice to put your own condiments but in my opinion, it could've used some spread or sauce in it.   Im not a fan of crinkle fries but they fried their fries better than in and out. I did surprisingly liked that it was crispier and thicker. So thumbs up here. I'd have to try their chili fries or other items to see how it compares to animal style fries. But the fries itself alone was good.  Ordered a strawberry shake and honestly, hands down better than in & out. I liked it better a it was thick, not overly sweet, and you can taste the ice cream in it.   Overall I would come for a shake and maybe some fries but I still to in & out for a burger.",

Line moves fast, food is made quickly and tables free up.   Some of my tips: - Try the portobello mushroom, you can get the shack stack to get best of both worlds - If you want to try a little bit of the peppers, you can ask for the smoke stack with the peppers on the side. Share it with someone.  - Sometimes i hold off on the fries and I order a double stack. Yes I do love the burger more than their fries. - Check their specials, sometimes they have new stuff on the menu",

Food took about 10 minutes to come out, not great but not ridiculous either. First disappointment was the size of the sandwiches, I had a single shack burger and a shack chicken sandwich. They were tiny, especially for the price point! Both looked good though, and the presentation was solid!The Chicken was up first, it looked nice and crispy, and the bun was soft and fresh, but then comes disappointment number two, dry ass chicken! And I mean dry, the breading was nice and crispy, but the bird was as dry as a cup of sand. Not enough sauce on the sandwich to help the dryness! Next up the burger which was hot and fresh and looked great, again a nice soft bun! The burger was damn tasty, I still prefer I&O, but this was a solid and tasty burger to be sure! Final disappointment, the shack sauce is really rather tasteless, doesn't really add much to the burger! I would stop in again if in the area for a burger, but I wouldn't make a special trip! In my opinion I&O is much better and way cheaper.",

The price is a little bit more expensive since you have to buy each item separately. I enjoy it whenever I am in Las Vegas visiting.  Service: Nothing crazy, normal routine and the people at the counter help you decide if you can't really make up your mind. Food comes out on a timely manner.   Ambiance: The place is cool. Super chill nothing to crazy.",

I ask the lady at the pick-up counter about our food. She keeps saying it's coming.  Everyone around us, people who ordered long after us are getting their food. What is happening? This goes on a couple of times. Around 8pm still no food. Enough is enough,so I requested a refund rather than wait an hour for two burgers. The person processing the refund said he doesn't know why we didn't get our food. After waiting all that time we never received our food and I will not be trying Shake Shack In the future. Needless to say, incredibly disappointing.",

The Shack Stack is the best - a combination of the Shake Shack Hamburger and the Shroom Burger. Do not skip out on the Double Down fries. And their shakes, insert drool emoji here. The staff is amazing, the restaurant is always clean, and the environment is incredibly fun. On our most recent visit, it was insanely busy. It didn't matter however, Danielle at the register was so gracious and sweet, making us feel like we were the only ones there. I highly recommend Shake Shack to everyone.

This eye-pleasing modernized facility is home to one of the best burgers I've had in my entire life. I don't know what it is about the food here but you can't even compare this food to in-n-out because they're on too different levels. The first time I came here, I got the double burger Shack and this past time I got the chicken shack, both were absolutely incredible. Also their shakes are to-die for. I always get the cinnamon dulce le leche shake. And then I dip my crinkle cut fries into my shake and all of the world is at peace.  Service is kind of slow at times, but I can't even ask for a better burger because there's just nothing like it. If you're new to the area and contemplating coming to this spot, I suggest coming thru because you can't go wrong.",

The wait order took about 5 minutes. I ordered to go. Chick n Shack, Shack Stack and Fries.   It was a beautiful, warm day so why not sit outside in the shade. Plenty of tables and chairs outside. Great way to people watch.   The Chick n Shack was good. It was sort of bland & dry at first until I added mayonnaise. Wow! Mayo totally made a big difference. Tasted so much better.   The Shack Stack was very good. Served hot, right off the grill. Cheesy, crispy portobello and charred beef patty was a great combo. Wasn't salty at all. Fries were delicious.   $20+ for 3 items. Not bad compared to other fast burger joints on the strip. Portion was rather small but it was worth it. We enjoyed our lunch. We'll definitely be back when we're in Vegas.",

I had the shack burger and my honey had the smoke shack burger - warning, spicy hot.  Add fries and oh yea, a shake - black and white.  All were quite tasty, with the shack sauce.  Fries were not as good as in-n-out, but decent.  Burgers were excellent.   Compare to Burger Lounge but not not Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen. The view in front of the NYNY had to count for the \"cherry on top\". All the mentioned food was $23 and we were both satisfied.  Cheers and happy fooding.",

My friend and I decided to both get the shack stack burger and the cheesy fries. The shack stack burger comes with portobello mushrooms and OMG it just melts into your mouth! When you bite into it, you have the cheese oozing out. You can taste the freshness from the tomatoes and the lettuce! If you get the chance, PLEASE TRY THEIR SHACK STACK BURGER! I am doing you a favor! My friend and I literally didn't want it to end. The cheesy fries were good also! They used a different cheese instead of the regular nacho cheese that every other place uses! The cheese is what made the fries taste a lot better! Highly recommend everyone and everyone's friends to try this place! It will literally change your life!!  Service (4 stars): There was a long line but the line moved pretty quickly. It didn't take long for us to get our food. They are very busy so when I requested for hot sauce, they took a while to give it to me. They forgot to give my friend his shake. So make sure you double check your orders.",

We aimed to order a variety of stuff so we went with single and double cheeseburgers, a Chicago dog, cheese fries and a pitcher of beer.  Understanibly the place was extremely busy, noisy and the employees were all over the place trying to clean and serve. We lucked out and was able to get a seat inside to avoid the heat. The food came out rather quickly. While the burgers were 'good', sadly their fries left much to be desired. The ice cold beer and Chicago dog saved the day.   Overall, I liked the food and would like to go back one day. However, with White Castle, Nathan's and a plethora of other choices down the strip, I wouldn't wait in a long line again.",

The ShackBurger's bun is soft and moist! I love the bread they use. The patty itself is juicy, and you can definitely taste all that seasoning it's great! The vegetables they use taste fresh, and the fries always taste like they're fresh out of the oven! The strawberry shake is by far the best shake for me out of the OG 3 (Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry). The strawberry was not too sweet or sour, and it was so creamy. It reminded me of Breyer's strawberry ice cream's distinct taste. I'm not putting chocolate or vanilla down in any sort of way. Honestly, the chocolate was like each chocolate ice cream from Dreyers or Ben and Jerry's -- I loved their shake.   Service: Nice and orderly! After ordering, you get a buzzer and you wait at a table until they call you up.   My one tiny tiny miniscule complaint is that the bathrooms only have 2 stalls.. merp.   Will come back again when I visit Vegas!!",

The quality of their food is great !   The menu has a lot of different options. They have burgers, hot dogs, a chicken sandwich, fries, shakes and even alcohol. I mean I guess it wouldn't be Vegas without the alcoholic options lol.   The staff is always very friendly and helpful even when it's super busy.   The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because the wait does get very crazy during certain times. Also, because it gets so busy it's hard to find seating inside. There is outdoor seating as well and it is shaded with misters up above. These also get full pretty quickly. The parking will also cost you. We park at the New York New York hotel self parking and the first hour is free but after that they charge you.   Overall I would definitely recommend this place because the food and staff is great regardless of the wait. Worth a try if you're ever in Vegas.",

I have to admit that I'm a diehard fan of In-N-Out, so I'll admit that I went into Shack Shack with less than an open mind. Fast forward several years, and I'm ready to give the place a fair \"shake\" (hardy har har).  Man, the burgers are fantastic. They are smash burgers, with a perfectly browned, Maillard reaction crust. The buns are soft, pillowy brioche-style breads. It's all very high quality. Cooked to order, and delicious.  I previously hated on the Kringle cut fries, but you know what? They're pretty damn good. Dip 'em in cheese sauce, and they're heavenly. Yum.  This location was very busy, being on the Vegas strip, but the line moved quickly and we got our food in short order.

Been wanting to try Shake Shack for a while to compare it with In and Out, Five Guys, etc.    Ordered a double shake burger, suppose to be a regular hamburger, and regular fries.  The regular burger became a single shake burger when I got it.  The burgers just didn't have much flavor with the exception of the saltiness of the burger.  I was anticipating that it might be a bit salty, hence I order a regular hamburger to see if there would be a difference caused by the cheese... but never got that chance (didn't want to waste food).  The buns were fresh, but to the point where it didn't really hold up to the meat and was too soft.  The best part of the meal was actually the regular fries.  I think I'm sticking to In and Out.  The staff were helpful and efficient in what they were doing and keeping the place clean.  So props for that, but not for the food.",

It's located off the strip near New York New York and although the lines get ridiculously long, they're sooo worth it.   The menu includes things from shakes (must get), to crinkly fries and all different types of burgers. My fat self ordered the Shack Burger and the infamous Chick 'n Shack which comes with a nice chicken patty, veggies, pickles & buttermilk herb mayo! This is the best quick fast food fix that'll leave you satisfied. I'd recommend those two and the hand-spun vanilla shake!",

I ordered the smokestack with all the fresh veggies and  without peppers cus it was cheaper than ordering a regular burger and adding bacon. We also got a side of cheesy fries which can easily feed two folks.    It's pretty much self serve after you order at the counter so I can't say much about the service. They do have a nice variety of tasty lemonade available,  so definitely give those a try.",

    "text": "Had been hearing tons of stories of friends that keep going to NY for biz trips keep posting and raving about how awesome the burgers were.  Was out in Vegas for CNY and right after we checked into the hotel, we headed straight to New York New York hotel.    Walked up and saw a short line forming and was afraid we'd have to wait for a while but surprisingly, we were able to order our food within 5 minutes.  Not bad since I've heard people waiting hours at the location in NY.  Quickly browsed the menu and saw that they had a new addition to the menu which was called the shack meister <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=A3AtT1ZyKFgnYMkVIOcWgA#Fu4YiaFfkDwMOilF7kayjw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shak...</a>.  Opted to try it out since it sounded pretty tasty.  Next we ordered the shack stack, shack-cago dog, fries and a coffee fair shake w/ malt added <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shake-shack-las-vegas-2?select=A3AtT1ZyKFgnYMkVIOcWgA#TvJZf0wIulUraPZNeWK4iQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shak...</a>.    Wasn't overly impressed with the shack-cago dog nor was I impressed with the shack meister but damn was the shack stack unique!  As most have already commented, what makes this burger so damn tasty is the cheese stuffed portobello fried mushroom.  Fries were just so so but they were nicely golden fried.  I loved the coffee fair shake though it could've been a little thicker.  Would definitely come back and am still keeping my fingers crossed that they open up a location in LA.",

In lieu of waiting in the insane lines for the Hollywood location, I waited patiently to have my first bite of shake Shack during our Las Vegas vacation.  I'm glad I did because, being on the strip and surrounded by hundreds of other dining destinations, we didn't have to wait in a crazy line.   I chose the Double Shack Burger and cheese fries for my first Shack experience and I believe I chose right!  The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were really good.  I will say that the burger had a striking flavor resemblance to Wendy's though.  I'm not sure how to feel about that, but at the same time, I love Wendy's too!  With that said, fast food can never compare to the quality of burger that Shake Shack produced.  I still don't think I will battle the lines in Hollywood to get another burger, but it is my hope that they expand closer to my town so I can enjoy their food more often, without having to make a trip out of it.",

Looked up the location...of course they would put in New York New York. OF COURSE GUYS.  Anyways, veterans of Shake Shack know that if you've never been here, you always get that Shack Stack with a side of crinkle cut fries. Because, obviously, the Shack's regular burger isn't going to beat out In-N-Out. But last I checked, no one has a fried portabello mushroom stuffed with cheese either. Although hey, they let me add crispy onions on top too this time around. MUCH WIN WAS HAD.  The only issue I have with the location of this place is that it's really only accessible by walking. If you drive here, you end up having to park in NY NY's parking garage. Not bad, but it's still a bit of a walk. That said, when you have the choice between walking 10 minutes vs. flying 6 hours to New York, the obvious answer is obvious.",

    "text": "Finally we got over to Shake Shack to try its ballyhooed burgers and somewhat novel flat-top dogs.  Food and service met all expectations.  A busser even took my tray as I was getting up to toss it.  Only the men's restroom needed attention, with piled up paper towels making it a mess.  Although the order taker said it would be substantially pink, the beef patty of a ShackBurger ordered \"medium\" was just starting to show pink.  But, festooned within a nice chewy bun with fresh tomato slices, ragged but fine lettuce, Applewood smoked bacon, very tasty pickle chips, and a great orange-colored lubricant known as ShackSauce, the burger was juicy and delicious.  I quickly determined that with a sauce resembling Jack's secret sauce, no mustard was needed.      A Shack-cago Dog was a little unorthodox being grilled spread-eagle after the all-beef wiener was nearly severed lengthwise in two.  But the grilled meat's juices flowed out and helped make this dog very tasty.  And, when bit into, about the correct amount of zip spurted into the mouth from the included Sport Pickle.  Other than the unconventional treatment of the hot dog itself, and relish that was green but not emerald green, this looked and tasted like a classic and very good Chicago Dog.  Crinkle Cut French Fries and Cheese Fries were springy, flavorful, and satisfying.  And a regular Chocolate Shake was small, but Diane reported that, being rich and chocolately, it was quite ample enough.  We will definitely be back to this very tasty burger and dog joint to enjoy more of the same.",

It's a fast food chain, so no one should be appalled at how their version of a vegetarian burger features a deep-fried cheese-stuffed mushroom cap. The vegetarian diet is not strictly synonymous with healthy. But I digress.  It's a tasty burger. A bit too much going on for my personal preference, but definitely something different to try. Beef is fresh, mushroom cap is hot and cheesy, and I found the tangy Shack Sauce added a little something extra. In the future, I'd rather get either the standard Shack Burger OR the Shroom Burger rather than combining them. I wasn't blown away, but I was pleasantly surprised.  For those irate about prices and wait times, it's on the Strip... so deal with it. Try a weekday evening after 8 and you'll have minimal wait. Price inflation isn't any different than WhiteCastle trying to sell $8 burgers, and it's cheaper than a flight to the East coast.  PS, crinkle cut fries are overrated but they don't suck.",

There's a variety of selections of burger to milkshakes, and alcohol. I've decided to get the shake shack burger that consist of a cheeseburger annnnd a mushroom burger on top! Ugh,  mushroom burger, you can't go wrong with that. The sizing of the burger is a good size, it gets you satisfied and full. What I liked about the mushroom burger was that it was filled with cheese! Soooo good. But I felt the burger itself was a bit heavy for me. It's pretty oily. But you definitely can get your money's worth. I also got a side of cheese fries. It's pretty average. I recommend it to any cheese lover at there, don't expect it to be the best but it's something worth trying.   Overall, I love the side bars with lots of sauce accommodation to your needs with water if needed. It's worth a try but I'm probably going to stick to in and out, being affordable and just being light on the burger.",

    "text": "Have you ever eaten a burger that whistled? Mine did. At Shake Shack.  I was indecisive over which of their five burgers that I wanted to try, so I opted for the Shack Stack: combination of the 'Shroom Burger and Cheeseburger. One bite into that deep fried 'shroom, and I swear, it let out some kind of a whistle-sigh. Gooey, cheesy goodness then overflowed out and plopped onto my tray. *Homer Simpson drool*   Here's the burger bummer: all that cheese did take away from the ability to taste the burger patty. Next time around, I might select either Shack Burger or 'Shroom Burger. Unsure if I'd do both again, but dang, I just can't shake off my cravings for the Shack Stack!   Also devoured was a single scoop vanilla custard ice cream on a cone, which wasn't enough for me. A double scoop might've been the way to go. In addition to standard vanilla and chocolate offerings, there's also a flavor of the week that can be found on the back of their menu.   Prices are reasonable. The Shack Stack is the most costly burger on the menu, costing over $9. Their golden, crunchy crinkle fries are an additional cost. For being situated on The Strip inside the NYNY, the food is a bargain.  No complaints about the service. Quick, efficient, helpful, and amiable.   Plan to come with other people if you dine here. Patrons are constantly coming and going, so seats are limited -- seat stalk, but don't be a weirdo about it. There aren't purse hooks on the high tables -- WTF, really? Be prepared to cradle your baggage, or take the chance of leaving your stuff on the table for someone to jack while you're stuffing your face. When the weather permits, it's great to dine outside and people watch -- that is, if you don't mind seeing the occasional rolling advertisements for escorts, but that's just a typical Vegas day on The Strip.  Shake Shack's a decent burger spot, especially for visitors and those who work nearby. On the other hand, being a local and living and working on the other end of town, I would only return if I was in the area.",

The Quad was good, the fries were fresh, So, why isn't Shake Shack the best?   I'll start with the good because I don't want to be mean, The service was great, the restaurant was clean.    Refills on your drinks and not on the fries, They hooked it up anyway, which was a pleasant surprise.   I had a great time with friends and had some fun, After only one visit at Shake Shack, I think I'm done.  Now for the bad and don't you get mad, I got the bill and felt I was just had.   Curious about the hype and wanted to be hip, I was so disappointed because our meal was a grip.   A regular burger is small and I hate to pout, You definitely get a lot more at IN-N-Out  I can't believe I spent forty dollars on fast food for two, You all have been warned if you read this review  Peace!!!",

It's a nice spot. Has indoor and outdoor seating.  I tried the Shake Shack burger and cheese fries. The cheese is your typical nacho cheese, good but the fries are good alone as well. The burger was a good size. Not too overwhelming and messy. I'd say it's a close second in my book to In-n-Out. I would definitely eat there again next visit.",

The line wasn't too crazy based on what I've seen to be the norm. I went for the shake stack, cheese fries and a drink. All this for $17.50. Yikes!!!   The burger was solid and the I enjoyed the fries, but for a fast food burger, that price was steep. I liked the burger, but if I were ever to happen upon Shake Shack again, I would skip the fried stuffed mushroom. The concept sounded delicious, but I was disappointed in the execution. It was over battered, dry and the cheese stuffed inside was a watery mess.  It was good for a one off, but I'll stick to other notable fast food stops for my burger fixes at 1/3 the price.",

The location is pretty large with indoor and outdoor seating. The line moves pretty quickly and the food comes out fairly quick as well. I ordered the shake stack which comes with the fried portabello mushroom and the meat patty. It was delicious!!! I loved the cheese stuffed portabello which added a nice crunch to the burger. I also got the cheese fries, which are crinkle cut fries topped with melty cheese. I actually really liked the fries, but the cheese tasted a little powdery to me. For dessert, I got the concrete, vanilla with chocolate toffee. My only complaint is that it's pretty small for the price.    I can't wait to come back!!",

I opted to walk here since my hotel was nearby.  The exterior storefront is gorgeous and the interior is chic and has flat screens thru out the dinning room and an extra large one at the center of the dinning area. This night happen to be the National College football championship -  so it was nice to dine and enjoy the game.   Since this was my first time ever trying out Shake Shack and I wanted to mix it up. I ordered a single Shack Burger, Shack cago dog, crinkle fries and a peanut butter shake. I heart the remote sized buzzer that alerted me when my order was ready.  Overall the food was yummy - the buns are soft and fresh, everything was not overly salted. The hot dog was lean and the toppings were fresh. The burger was delish and the peanut butter shake was bomb! The gal who took my order was a newer employee in training but did a wonderful job.  There was plenty of staff on hand to service the customers needs.  BTW Shake Shack announced they are going public a few weeks ago and will be expanding furthermore. I'm looking forward for them to arrive to So Cal!",

The burgers are really good, but the crinkle cut cheese fries are a must. We got one of the fancier fries with all the fixings but the regular old cheese fries are where it's at! Highly recommend! It gets busy here but you never wait long. It's also nice to get inside away from the heat even though they have a nice patio. It's also great that they have misters outside around the perimeter to help you cool off from the summer Vegas heat.",

We both put in our orders and went to wait with the buzzers they give you. My in laws buzzer went off and they got there food within about 7 minutes. 15 minutes later, our buzzer still hadn't gone off so my husband went to wait at the counter. Another 8 minutes went by and my in laws were finished with there food and we still hadn't gotten ours. I went to see what was going on and they had not called our order nor buzzed our buzzer. We approached the worker at the counter and explained how long we have been waiting while everyone else in the restaurant was being served within minutes. The worker cut us off and stated she had just clocked in and didn't know what's going on, she asked another worker and they told her that the order is being made. We asked for an ETA and they ignored us. The manager came out and we asked her to look into our order as no one was explaining to us why it is taking so long and is ignoring us. She ignored us. We demanded she find out and another worker told her that they called us and we didn't pick up so they have to remake our order. I told them our buzzer has not buzzed and we have been waiting at the counter and they have not called us. The manager proceeded to ignore us. I raised my voice to ask her how long it will take and she ignored me again. Another worker told her that our order was ready, by that time we were so upset I demanded our money back. She grabbed the tray with our order and threw it on the counter behind her, angrily. She told us she needs the receipt, we handed it to her and she walked away. It took her another 6 minutes to give us our money back and did not apologize. We won't be returning.",

    "text": "This place is conveniently located right in front of NY NY. It is steps from where I was staying in Excalibur. Being a CA native, I wanted to see how this place compares to our beloved In n Out. When I was in Vegas in June, I decided to put it to the test. I ordered their shack burger, their hot chicken sandwich, and cheese fries. By the end of our weekend in Vegas, we had gone three times to this place! The hot chicken was the star of the show. The breading was delicious and flavorful. Not too hot, but with actual spice to it. The slaw on top was also good. I usually hate slaw as it is full of mayo. This one had what seemed like chipotle or paprika, making it pink in color. No overwhelming mayo flavor. In fact, it complimented nicely with the sandwich. However, the bun was ice cold? I would think it would be toasted. My chicken was fine, but the bun was soggy and cold. Real let down, but still delicious  The burger has NOTHING on In n Out. Trust me. However, it was still pretty tasty. This bun was also ice cold. What is up with that Shake Shack? Toast your buns!! Your meat was juicy and flavorful. The burger was topped with lettuce, cheese, and a couple tiny tomato slices. I advice putting full size slices of tomato and adding some onion to your burgers. Moreover, no sauce? At least some ketchup on top would do a world of good. You have to do more if you want to compare with In n Out's burger with lettuce, big tomatoes, onion, and secret sauce. I do appreciate how fresh and juicy the meat was, so I still give it a good review.  The cheese fries were crinkle cut with a liquid cheese sauce. It tasted a little plasticky for my liking. The next times I went I ordered plain fries dipped in ketchup. They were delicious. Nice amount of salt and cooked just right. Sometimes In n Out overcooks their fries, so this was nice to see.   When we went back, I ordered the hot chicken sandwich again and a root beer float. The custard they have here is amazing. Creamy and rich. On a triple digit summer Vegas day, this so hit the spot.  TL;DR order their hot chicken sandwich and fries. Just make sure you remind them to toast their buns!   Will no doubt be back every time I am in Vegas until they do away with their hot chicken!",

Everything is a la carte, no combo deals.   Decor: outdoor and indoor seating with some big tables to share with other diners.  Shack Stack: 9.59: signature cheeseburger and 'shroom burger all in one with crisp-fried portobello mushroom, melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce and onion ring. It looked big and thick, but it was not problem after a good workout.  The cheese oozed out that it dropped at times which made eating somewhat messy.  Black & White Shake: $5.29: vanilla shake with fudge. This popular shake was indeed very thick, but I didn't think it was extraordinaire. I'd try either root beer float or coffee fair shake next time.  Fountain drinks are unlimited refill, but there was no fountain machine, so you need to go up to the pick up counter to get replacement drinks. Water and condiments are self-served.  Parking: park in Monte Carlo parking structure, beware that they're installing ticket booth in the structure, so not sure if they will validate or charge parking fee in the future.   Although you can taste the difference from In N Out or Island's, Shack Stack is not a burger I crave for like I would Bachi Burger.",

I don't think it's that worth, maybe just to try. I also got the jackpot custard and it was pretty good as well. It's a bit busy and crowded but we were able to find seats.  Cool place to go to for the hype if you're visiting Vegas, but idk if I'll come back.",

    "text": "I've heard the legends about this place and I've seen the pics of it about 1000 times on my snapchat and Instagram. When I came to Vegas with my friends we made sure to make this the first place we eat when we landed. It's at the beginning of the strip and we stayed at treasure island. If your familiar with the strip, you'd know it's on opposite ends. It was about a 30 minute walk just b/c there's so many people and it's not a straight walk. We were also really hungry so the walk seemed even longer. Shake Shack is located at NY NY and has a restaurant front you can't miss. You fall in line to take your order and then they give you a pager while you wait. There's a ton of seating both inside and outside that it's never really a problem. Their restaurant is so cute. I really enjoyed the retro look to it.  Their menu has a lot of options. They gave different burger variations, chicken sandwiches, crinkle cut fries and many different shake/custard/malt options. I ordered the trailer burger (burger with grilled onions and bacon) and a side of fries. Their burgers don't come with a side of fries. I only wish I ordered a milkshake, but my friend ended up not finishing hers so I finished her strawberry milkshake and it was delicious. Their burger and fries were so good. Best way I can describe it is that it's a higher quality innout burger. I think it's better than innout. It is pretty pricey though. My burger and fries were about $13. But you get what you pay for right? It was cooked perfectly and it was so good. At first it doesn't look that filling but I was so full afterwards. My boyfriend and guy friends were still hungry afterward words though and they ordered doubles.   Overall, great burger place. More expensive, but way worth it with the quality. I will be eating here everytime I'm in Vegas.",

Of course, your first time here, the name tells you to get a burger and shake, right? I ordered the single Shack Burger, a side of fries, and a strawberry shake, totaling to roughly $15.   The burger was juicy and flavorful thanks to the Shake Shack sauce. Fries were fresh and crispy, the better end of the spectrum of crinkle cut fries. Shake was above average, I mean you can't really go wrong with a shake.   The overall meal was really good and served fresh. The only downside to Shake Shack is the size of the burger.",

The Vegas location was definitely a nice reminder of my blissful NY experience, but unfortunately was not as amazing as the holy burger franchise that I know and love.   Sure the burger was good, but it didn't have that wow factor from the Shake Shack I've had in NY. The shroom burger is supposed to be mindblowing the moment you bite into it, a huge slice of portobello and cheese slowly melting into your mouth. Disappointingly, this fried shroom patty was smaller than expected and just tasted plain greasy.   The cheese fries were just as delicious and the custard was no disappointment either. THE CUSTARD....wow. So smooth, creamy, delicious, and not overwhelmingly sweet. The perfect dessert.   Also the seating situation is a nightmare. People are gathered like vultures and waiting around for seats to open.",

So we ended up ordering the Chick'n Shack, double down fries, and regular fries. Also, because we ordered the Chick'n Shack, we were given free frozen custards.   I've been to the West Hollywood location prior so I was glad to have tried the original Shackburger there and then the Chick'n Shack at this location. It was delicious! It comes with lettuce, pickles, and mayo. I'm not that into pickles but it was good and you can tell how fresh it is.   Apparently they also ran out of the normal bowl or whatever they use for the double down fries so we ended up with 3 individual boats. The double down fries were alright. It got a little bit too cheesy. I hate crinkle cut fries, but their actual fries were amazing!! I can't stress enough how good and crispy it was! If I was in the area, I would definitely come back again just for the fries!",

Only down side would probable be the cheese fries because they were a tad basic. Wish they had a location in SF!",

I don't usually like fast food and I'm not sure this qualifies but let me say this... either way, it's a great cheeseburger.

First bite of the Shake Stack made the taxi ride from the other side of the strip and the line to the cashier worth it. It's the cheeseburger with a fried mushroom stuffed with muenster and cheddar cheese and shack sauce. It's rich and so good in between the soft potato buns. There's never too much cheese so we indulged in Cheese Fries and i was blown away! Crispy edges and soft and gooey under the almost velveeta like cheese sauce. Do i dare say i like this better than In N Out's animal fries? The simplicity did it for me. I'm not sure where i found room for it but i dug deep and killed a Shack Cago Dog. If you like pickled veg this is for you. Yum though the burgers were the winners. For the holiday season they were offering fun frozen custard options like gingerbread and peppermint chocolate. I went for the classic and had a vanilla frozen custard shake. Thick custard, great flavor but In N Out wins the shake comparison for me. Overall, I'm a fan and can't wait to come back!! Crossing my fingers they open another West Coast location in San Francisco.",

This fast food chain has elevated their fry game by not just giving you piping hot, perfectly seasoned crinkle cut fries. They have a cheese sauce that complements the fries nicely.  I'm convinced that if you cover your napkin with the cheese, it will even taste good.     I had the pleasure of sampling the following shakes:  chocolate, Christmas cookie, and chocolate peppermint.  As a die hard chocolate fan, I hate admitting that their Christmas cookie was superior to the chocolate shakes.

The red chili peppers they use in the burgers are great.   We ordered the fries that are for 2-3 people, I believe they are called the Double Down Fries. Those were fantastic. It's fries, bacon that is nice and crispy, red chili peppers, and I'm pretty sure it has their shack sauce, or some kind of melted cheese. They were fantastic. Would go back just for those alone.   Good food, plenty of seats, they sell good craft beers, but prices are high.",

It contains a portabella mushroom stuffed with melting cheese, inside a cheese burger. It definitely tickled my fancy. I got in line and took a look at the menu and noticed that there were no combos. You had to order everything a la carte. What the hell kind of burger place is this?!?! The burger costs about $10, the fries were about $3, and the drink was about $3. My total came out close to about $20. Strike 1 for Shake Shack.   I received my food, and the party I was with, all said the same thing... \"this is a small ass burger for 10 bucks.\" It really was. And it was really greasy as well. Strike 2.   I began to masticate my burger and nothing really hit me as... WOW. This was my first shake shack experience, and there was no emotions that stirred within me, unlike my first In n Out burger. Strike 3.   I didn't order any of the shakes there because I'm lactose intolerant, but a few of my friends did, and no one raved about them. The only thing they mentioned was that the cups were freaking tiny for what they paid.   Overall, it's overpriced, no combos, small portions, no wow factor, means I wouldn't go back. In N Out definitely wins out in every way.",

    "text": "East Coast versus West Coast. Pac versus Biggie.  Gotham versus City of Angels.  We can now add onto that list: In N Out versus Shake Shack.  And like the other comparisons, there is no real winner.  It all really depends on your mood.  Shake Shack is great because the burgers are cooked by smashing the patty onto a griddle and letting it develop a nice charred crust. The meat is the star of the burger.  The toppings are average.  The bun itself is soft, but it could really use some \"extra toast\" (borrowing from In N Out terminology).  The standout item, and one I am sure everyone knows about, is the \"Shake Stack\".   It is a tremendous construction of a breaded cheesy mushroom patty stacked on top of a regular meat patty.  If you really want to go for gang busters, add bacon for a nominal fee (side note: I really don't give a damn if the WHO thinks processed meats causes cancer). The cheese fries make for a worthy companion.  I would be remiss if I did not toss in my two cents regarding \"who wins\" in a comparison between my beloved In N Out and Shake Shack.  The Shack wins for the superior meat patty, the option to add bacon, and for that glorious mushroom patty.  In N Out has better quality  ingredients and customization options (e.g. toasted buns, grilled onions, chopped peppers).  Taking in the whole experience of eating an In N Out burger, it really is greater than the sum of its parts.  Where it may be lacking to Shake Shack, In n Out's je ne sais quoi keeps it on equal footing.  So where does that leave you?  In N Out? Shake Shack?  Bro, have you not been reading my completely unnecessarily long review?    West Coasters: Order the Shake Stack with bacon.  Add cheese fries.  Maybe a custard if you have the space.  There is beer if you want it, too.  East Coasters: Order the double double (animal style if you are some monster) with extra toast and chopped peppers.  Animal style fries. Neapolitan shake or root beer float for dessert.  Or, if you are feeling up for it, get both.  Gotta love Vegas.",

Workers seemed to be miserable to be there and there were some mistakes with the order. The cashier put our buzzer number in wrong so we waited forever. There was a crowd so we tried to be patient. Finally when we went to go inquire, we learned our food had been sitting at the kiosk for who knows how long because both receipts (with our name on it) read \"1\" and our buzzer was \"71\". This combined with the error in our error (again, our receipts matched so we know we took the right food) was a little frustrating.  The fries are notable and wonderful, that was the highlight of the meal.   Ultimately, In-n-out has a better price point, a better taste, and would be my first choice of the two.",

    "text": "When you step inside Shake Shack you are setting foot inside the casual fast food restaurant of the future. This is a futuristic fast food restaurant where people can eat fast food while watching professional sports on the overhead television sets, where instead of waiting on a long line to pick up your food, you can sit on a circular bench while watching sports until your beeper alerts you know it is ready. This past weekend, on the Sunday where Green Bay played Seattle in the Super Bowl playoffs, I spent some time inside the fast food restaurant of the future.     Shake Shack is located at the northern periphery of the New York New York property near the Monte Carlo. In the very near future, Shake Shack will be a Gateway business to the Park, the exciting entertainment complex that will link the Las Vegas Strip to the Arena.     When I visited Shake Shack, it was understandably busy. People are saying it is the In N Out Burger of the East Coast. When people say that a fast food place is the In N Out Burger of the East Coast, a long line is guaranteed. This was a long line that moved fast. This was my first impression of sharp management. The line is a small room with a wall of menu boards (pictures are below). I am impressed with the selection. Their menu includes hamburgers, hot dogs,  crinkle cut fries, concrete, shakes, wine, beer. At the end of the line, a friendly person took my order. After paying, he presented me with a beeper. Once the beeper would go off, I  would pick up my food at the pickup window. I'd plant myself on the circular bench to watch the Super Bowl playoffs. What's really neat is that there is a gigantic HD screen covering a good part of the wall above the condiments.     After picking up the food, there was fortunately a table. The dining room is decent size with a modern interior. In addition to the dining room are the outside seats along the Strip. With the staff persistent on cleaning the tables, and dumping your trash, Shake Shack is a clean place to eat.     Decisions! Decisions! I ordered the Smokeshack Burger with crinkle cut fries, and a Coke Zero. The cost was nearly double than In N Out. The Smokestack burger made up of Angus meat was out of this World. I savored the cheese, applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and Shack sauce. This is the second best burger I had in recent times (my favorite is Portillos in Chicago). The crinky cut fries I felt were good, yet inferior to Nathan's. I hear the shakes are phenomenal. After trying Boulevard Creamery nearby, I might be delaying their shakes for an indefinite period.     Is Shake Shack the New York In N Out?      After eating here and having grown up in New York, I feel that Shake Shack is more comparable to Nathan's than In N Out. Shake Shack is higher priced than In N Out, features more items, serves crinkle cut fries, and in several ways is just different. White Castle would be a better comparison between a New York fast food restaurant and In N Out. In my opinion Shake Shack doesn't have a large presence in the New York metropolitan area. For the record, there are more Nathan's and White Castles in New York than Shake Shacks. Currently , there is only one Shake Shack in Long Island, NY. Shake Shack started in 2004, where White Castle and Nathan's were established in my grandparents generation.     Regardless that Shake Shack, from my perspective is no East Coast In N Out, it is a futuristic fast food restaurant that is fun to hang out in. It was a ball to share in the Super Bowl playoffs while enjoying delicious food. I never had this experience in McDonald's or Burger King.     I am a fan of Shake Shack. It is nice to go into a fast food place watch a game until the beeper goes off, enjoy quality food while watching a game. It is nice to have friendly employees take my order and volunteer to dump my trash. I can see Shake Shack in my check-in future.",

And the decor is NOT MUSTARD YELLOW & CATSUP  RED!! Very pleasing greens & wood tones .     The Shack Burger is a nice size too! Not those HUGE, OVERWHELMING side of beef burgers. You can order 1 or 2 patties, the bun was very good, not sweet like the Bachi Burgers (which I love!!) just a nice fresh deelish bun, fresh tomato & lettuce. Didn't come w/ mustard or Catsup but I added it after my first bite. The beef is hormone FREE, and cooked perfectly for my tastes     Didn't indulge in their French fries, however the choc shake was OOOH SOOO GOOD also!!!!     If your around NY NY & want a burger STOP by, you'll be happy u did",

It was all pricey though since they do not offer combos or a meal, everything is separate.",

    "text": "To this native Californian, Shake Shack is an almost mythical beast that has received heaping praise from In-N-Out fans. He hasn't been out to New York City to see what the hype was about, and it seemed like it would take ages until he finally would be able to visit this so-called mecca.  But last year, he found out they would open a restaurant to open in Las Vegas. So he waited. And waited. And waited a few more weeks after it had opened, out of concern for the lines.  Today was the day. Finally, he would brave the crowds and navigate the labyrinth that is the Strip. He did not want to try White Castle further up the strip without having given a go at what would likely be the better burger. So he parked at the New York New York Hotel & Casino's self-parking garage, found his way through the casino, and strolled northward down the sidewalk. At about half an hour before noon, he finally arrived at his destination.  The line started outside and led to another maze inside, this one marked by the cordons. The Californian was quite patient, enjoying the air-conditioned room that  even in Spring-like weather was a relief from the desert outside. After perhaps 20 minutes' wait overall, he finally placed his order.  It would be almost another 15 minutes before his pager would ring. He was amused that these receivers were more akin to remote control devices than to the square coaster pagers used by other restaurants. Having forgotten to ask earlier, he was also glad to find stacks of plastic cups for obtaining water from the faucets. While he was playing with his phone, his pocket buzzed, and he knew immediately that the time had finally come.  He exchanged the gadget for his tray. He quickly found a seat on a high table that was being used communally by three other groups. He took a photograph of his Shack Stack burger (you would say \"of course he did!\" if you knew him), and then he ate his burger. Some might call it a slow pace, but he preferred to enjoy the flavors as best he could (as well as avoid potential indigestion).  He found the flavor of the meat patty to be much to his liking. The patty was cooked approximately to the default medium, perhaps medium-well. He regretted not ordering it rare for a brief second. He shrugged and continued to enjoy the burger, noticing the soft bun, the crunchy portobello mushroom, the gooey cheese, and the ubiquitous lettuce and tomato.  As his burger dwindled down to a few bites, he noticed that some of his neighbors at the table had obtained their order and that they had cheese fries. He asked if they would, pardon the odd request, be so kind as to sell him a fry so that he could taste it. They were generous enough to agree without any charge. While the cheese was a bit redundant with all the cheese already in the burger, he found that the fry did have a nice crisp on the outside and was salted properly. He realized perhaps a bit too late that having the fries and some ketchup might have complemented the burger.  In spite of that, he was certain in his belief that the burger needed to be able to stand on its own. In most respects, it did. However, the savoriness of the burger did not quite match that of his other favorite burgers, and there wasn't much sweetness to be found in the Shack Sauce, whereas the sauce provided by In-N-Out did have that element, and the relish he had requested on his burger at a recent Five Guys visit also provided that flavor. While he did in large part enjoy his burger, he did not feel a pressing need to return on his own because those other options are more accessible and would be certain to provide more satisfaction at a significantly lower price.  Lastly, our protagonist would urge you to try Shake Shack for yourself and decide for yourself where they stand in the burger hierarchy. He doesn't place it at the very top, but perhaps you might.",

At Shake Shack I generally get the SHACK BURGER which is a cheeseburger w/ lettuce, tomato, and their shack sauce. They have CRINKLE FRIES!!! It's my absolute favorite, and you have to get it with CHEESE!!! If I had to eat burgers and fries, these are definitely the pick!  For your vegetarians the SHROOM BURGER is really great as well. Imagine the shack burger but with a portobello mushroom! :)   ENJOY!",

For about 6 dollars, you can get yourself a decent fast food burger.  So the burning question is, is it better than in-n-out?  The meat is certainly better (juicier), but I think the overall pacakge of in-n-out is better in terms of bread, ingredients, and sauce (not to mention price).    However, the hype is real.  Get yourself a decent burger and fries meal at Shake Shack for ~$12 on the strip.  And if you're craving craft beer, they have that too.  4 stars.",

    "text": "If crying. Insert burger. - Words to live by from a tiny baby's onesie sold at the Shake Shack.   New York's best is now cleverly dishing out cheesy burgers (and shakes) from the New York, New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas! This bustling burger \"shack\" is quite the word on the strip right now. Although they are connected to the Hotel & Casino, their entrance is actually located right on the strip, next to Tom's Urban and the Swatch Watch store.  There is a sizable, tourist-y line (but it moves quickly), a greeter that passes you a burger of the day card and a menu, efficiently directing you to the order window where you receive a nifty buzzer.  I never tried Shake Shack before, but I think I OD'd on melty cheese tonight. Here are the culprits:  ShackMeister Burger $6.19 (Add Bacon $1.55) - Simple. It wasn't bad... but I've had better. Cheeseburger, Shack Sauce (didn't taste it), crispy fried ale-marinated shallots (didn't taste them) , and we added applewood smoked bacon. The burger got lost in all of that thick cheese. Flavor rating: 3/5  Shack Stack $9.49 - Shack stack you tasty son of a bun! Cheeseburger with a crisp-fried portobello mushroom cap filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses (!!), topped with lettuce, tomato and Shack Sauce (didn't taste it). Get outta town with that portobello cap. The lightly battered, seasoned and fried mushroom cap was oozing with gooey cheese and flavor. The burger was good, but the inventive mushroom cap set it off into outer-space. Flavor rating: 5/5  Cheese Fries $3.95 (Add Fried Shallots $1) -crinkle cut fries topped with lots (and I mean lots) of melted cheese blend. We wanted to be different so we requested to add fried shallots and voila! Cheese overdose. Flavor rating: 3/5  Strawberry Shake $5.25 - it's a good, thick, strawberry shake. Have you ever had In-N-Out's version? They taste identical. My only gripe - they serve you a small and charge you over $5. In-N-Out is the way to go. Flavor rating: 5/5  In retrospect, I would nix the cheese fries and just order regular fries and share the shack stack with my date. But hey, you live and you learn!   Is it worth a try? Yes. Is it better than In-N-Out? Your mileage may vary. However, I'll forever prefer In-N-Out for their affordable prices and their grilled onions! What's Shake Shack got against glorious grilled onions?",

    "text": "Unfortunately... i guess maybe this place was a bit overhyped. I was wondering why people were comparing to in-n-out or possibly smash burger. After hearing so many people trying it, finally had the chance to go last night during my friend's break while she was at work.   This place sits on the NE corner of the NYNY casino on the outside with a HUGE bright sign. The location is pretty nice (despite the construction for the new arena). Almost hard to miss. Lots of seating inside and outside (though still not enough because its a strip location AND it was during dinner time). Upon ascending up a few steps of stairs and into the restaurant, a HUGE menu graces you upon entry showing their entire menu of food, sides, shakes, drinks, wine, champagne, and beer ! (though their \"drinks\" takes up more than 1/2 the menu Lol)   Upon previously reviewing the menu during work and other times of boredom, i had decided to get the Shack Stack which consisted of their shack burger + mushroom burger. Standard Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Just because it was my first time, i decided to go all out with an order of cheese fries and a strawberry shake.   My friend had ordered before i did and gotten his food first. He had ordered the SmokeShack which was a Single Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce. Lets just say it looked a bit sad ... small... he commented \"at least the bun is soft\" then the ol jokes start flying XD   When i had received my order, it looked much better, due to the help of the humongous fried portabello mushroom in the middle. Is it worth almost double the price compared to the normal burger? possibly. is it worth it by itself with comparison? maybe not. The burger overall, a little unsatisfying. Bun is indeed soft and delicious, but most surprising part is the fried portabello mushroom.... was it was stuffed with cheese o.O ! (so much for the previously mentioned \"research\" huh? lol...) The mushroom is filled with a melted muenster and cheddar cheese. Not overpowering but still flavorful and stringy cheese XD.    Strawberry shake - nice and flavorful. tick but not too thick. able to drink with straw. Pretty good shake. Kind of small though for the price. Like a small cup size you'd get from any other joint.   Cheese fries - depressing. Lol..... Crinkle cut fries covered with a cheese sauce that reminds me of nacho cheese. Menu says its super addicting.... not so much :( was hoping for something more amazing T_T sad face   This meal costed $20 and some change. Holy crap. Prior to visit, i was expecting the burger to be bigger, or rather everything else to be slightly bigger and better. For $20, not worth it :( At least i can say i tried it? The shakes are good, and if i were to come again, id go for a shake and maybe try a hot dog (altho sams club hot dog for $1.50 is so much more appealing LOL)",

I've been to their locations in New York and Boston - lines are always long but move quickly. And if you only want a concrete, shake or drinks - use the C line which is almost always empty.  I know most people would complain about the price. $5-9 for a burger? Why not? It's antibiotic and hormone-free Angus beef. They use quality ingredients. I personally don't care paying more for better quality ingredients.   The process is simple. Fall in line. Decide what you want so, when you get to the front of the line, you're not THAT person holding up the line. Place your order. Pay. Get your vibrator. Find a table - sometimes you have to share a table and that is normal so, learn to share and be social. Pick up your food when you feel your vibrator go off. Enjoy.  My favorite burger is the Shake Stack which has a beef patty, lettuce, crisp-fried portobello mushroom, melted muenster cheese and ShackSauce...I have to get mine without tomatoes. Soooo tasty, warm and the cheese just oozes out. Mmmm...so yummy! I prefer the regular crinkle fries over the cheese fries. The cheese fries don't excite me. For my drink, I get white wine/ black and white shake/ coffee fair shake.",

    "text": "Finally tried this place after hearing so many good things about it, but I have to say it feels like just another burger joint with above average prices. My friends have compared it to In and Out and I have to say that In and Out wins because of price, taste, and quality.   I ordered the shack burger since I figured it seemed sensible to try out their original burger. When I picked it up it looked like a regular burger with no qualities that would make it stand out in my mind. Another thing I didn't like was how runny the sauce and cheese was. The bun was really soft and squishy which was weird because I am used to bread that has some sort of stability. The burger tasted alright. It had a more charred taste to it, kind of like the burgers you would have at a bbq.   The crinkle cut fries were actually pretty good so that brought in some redemption lol. They were crispy which is really important to me because soggy fries are just nasty. If you are going to eat unhealthy, you got to do it right!  I didn't try the shake this time, but I might come back just to check it out since the place is called Shake Shack haha. I did get the SHACK-A-PALOOZA with my friends which was pretty good! The only downer is that it was pretty small looking for the price of $15.95.   Give this place a shot if you are near the New York New York Hotel area and are craving for some American fast food (as if you couldn't get enough of that elsewhere). The first time it opened, there was a huge line out the door, but I went on a Friday night and there was hardly a wait.",

I don't know why, perhaps it's the sheer amount of burgers they are cooking. Not to say this one was bad because it was very yummy but I have had better burgers at other Shake shack's around the country and surprisingly inside the T-Mobile arena consistently.  If you're going to an event or a game get your shake shack inside the arena on the main concourse it's only a couple dollars more.",

While we visited on a Sunday evening it was packed  (but would you expect anything less for Vegas?)  My friend had been talking about a 'Shroom burger all day.  So of course, that is what I had to try.    When i got to the register to place my order - my cashier was amazing.  She asked if I had Shake Shack before - which I hadn't.   She suggested I get fries and a shake as well.  Which - I had been planning.    That 'shroom burger was - AMAZING.  I am not a huge burger gal - but I could eat that daily.  It was THAT good.  Add to that burger - fries and a peanut butter milkshake?  Best meal ever.    Shake Shack you have a new fan.  I can't wait till I visit another city that you are in.  But please - come to Pittsburgh.  We would love you here!",

(I saw this same staff member later emptying trash and picking up towering loads of empty trays, definitely a multi-tasker!)   The cashiers were getting people rung up quickly and they have a pager system to tell you when your order is ready. Everyone was calm and efficient - they really have some good processes in place!  Cheese fries with bacon A+ Hotdog A+ Shakes and floats A+  What made the hot dog extra delicious was they split it and grilled it flat, so more crispy grilled flavor!

    "text": "So I have this argument every time with my friends about Shake Shack and In-n-Out. Which one is better?  When I first tried Shake Shack, I thought it was better than In-n-Out. I definitely got a lot of \"Oh my gosh\", \"How dare you\", or \"Don't you dare disrespect In-n-Out like that\". Then as I tried In-n-Out again, my thoughts started to shift towards In-n-Out as the better burger joint. The juiciness of the burgers from In-n-Out was very refreshing. Don't get me wrong but Shake Shack's burger is for sure juicy. I just think that In-n-Out was a little better. At the end of the day, I really really like Shake Shack and what they have to offer. Sometimes I will switch things up and get Shake Shack because I want to try something different. I will say that Shake Shack fries are better though. Something about those fries gets me every time. I believe Shake Shack is East Coast burger joint while In-n-Out is West Coast. However, Shake Shack started to migrate over here and I know they have two locations.   If you're in the area, please come check out this burger joint because its delicious! I mean who doesn't like a burger? I believe they also have meat free burgers so they got burgers for anyone. Yummy!",

You would think people don't want a hamburger at 11 AM in the morning but you would be wrong. There was already a line forming with hungry foodies ready to eat and binge.   Once 11 AM hit the guy opened the door and a wave of people formed another line inside. The air conditioner is kicking in and the service to take our order was fast. Menu is right there in front of your face to see new items and old.   Ordered their hot chicken which is a hearty chicken that is deep fried and had some coleslaw inside the bun. Overall I thought the burger was pretty tasty and not that dry.   Ordered their famous cheese fries which tasted kind of like maybe nacho cheese sauce on crinkle fries. I don't know why but I do enjoy crinkle cut fries more when a topping is on it because it just grabs the sauce and makes it taste different than a regular fry. Or maybe it's just me.   Overall I enjoyed my experience and thought that this place was pretty good. Sad thing is that if you are driving now it's a $7.00 charge per hour at New York Casino. That would make me not want to go to any establishment at this casino because of having for worry about paying for parking.",

When our buzzer went off the shit show began. There were at least a half dozen other customers at the pick up counter whose buzzers went off yet no food present or coming out. A bunch of employees in the kitchen looked like they were assembling orders and trying to read tickets but nobody looked like they were in charge. I kept looking for one of them to make eye contact with us or other customers but at was as if they intentionally avoided it. A few minutes later a lady approached without my shake or the root beer that we ordered even though it was on the ticket. She just looked at us when we reminded her of this and went back for it. While the food was delicious, it was not a good value for the amount of food.

Shake Shack remains my pound for pound favorite. In-N-Out Burger is cheaper but far inferior and flavor. Wahlburgers is surprisingly similar in flavor, but features a much higher price point. Shake Shack is a truly delicious burger, as is the shack sauce.  The fries are uninspired and can certainly be skipped. Get a burger and a shake instead. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Hands down, Shake Shack is the best burger joint in town! Yes, I said it, even better than In-N-Out! Sad that there are limited locations across the country though. So when in Vegas, this place is a MUST! Everyone seems to go here. Depending on the day, this place is jammed packed. Of course, because it's very popular, but they are pretty fast at executing your order. I usually order the same kind of burger: the SmokeShack, with a side of fries. Amazingggg! The milkshakes (chocolate) are good too. Ive also tried the cheese fries and a bite of their Chick'n Shack... also recommended. Whenever I am on the Strip, I eat here twice and I bring some home (yup, through TSA security and on the plane)! Still delicious a day or two later!",

The portion size for the price I would say is pretty fair. I love these fries that they have. So much better than most places. I did get cheese fries though and I thought that was a little of a disappointment. The cheese on the fries were just slices of cheese that they melted which I didn't really think was worth the price, but overall it was a great meal. Their burgers are really good. I loved the taste and the buns aren't soggy at all. I would recommended everyone to come try it. Oh and the shakes are amazing too! Try it all!",

I ordered the Shack burger and my boyfriend ordered the fried chicken burger(?) -- the one with the BBQ sauce in it lol. And we also got two orders of fries. Everything was delicious, though I wish the fries were a bit crispier.   Customer service was great. An employee rushed over to bus a table for us so we could sit down. And despite it being overwhelmingly busy, all of the employees were still friendly.   I love love love Shake Shack! I wish there was one in Sacramento! :(",

Great flavor contrast that makes the veg taste extra fresh! I think I enjoy the in-n-out sauce more than the shake shack sauce though. I couldn't even taste any sauce in my hamburger to be honest ... And I don't know how to compare patty meats since I think they all taste the same, but I think the meat here was less visually appealing due to its lack of circularity (the shape was pressed to look au naturale).   Cheese fries were surprisingly super good. The cheese was so creamy for being a melty piece of cheese instead of liquid cheese! I do not understand.   Also picked up a brownie milkshake which was super rich and heavy, probably more so than in-n-out's. Too heavy in my opinion ... i regret not trying orange creamsicle-ish flavor instead.  This place is a must try for all west coast peoples who need to prove to themselves that in-n-out is better :-) Line moved quickly and the food came out fast! Shake shack is a very worthy burger spot that can take #2 place in my heart, lol",

    "text": "The fued continues.  Shake shack vs In N out  Shake shack definitely has great quality in their meat and buns as well as their malt shakes.   Shake shack has better fries, their malt shakes are no question the better choice. But the choice between which is better burger, it depends who you are.   If you love meat and cheese. Shake shack has more meat to bun ratio. Their cheese is completely melted and comes oozing out along with the juicy meat. Their burger buns are so soft you taste all meat and cheese.   In N Out has a more all around burger, not too much meat, not too little lettuce tomato onion, and their bun is toasted. It has more textures when chewing. IN N OUT wins the all around flavor of burger.   Shake shack takes the better fries and malt shakes.   In N out takes the win when it comes to value.   A double shake shack cheeseburger alone was about 8 dollars alone. MALT shake was about 6 dollars alone. If you got fries for another 6 bucks or so, youd be paying 20 a person just about. In N out is about 7 bucks for a whole meal.   All in all, pricey but a very very good product.",

I've always wanted to try the restaurant place after hearing raving reviews about it in New York, but I hadn't been to New York for over 5 years and I was afraid I would never get to try NY's favorite burger spot ( comparable to In n' Out in CA ). They also serve beer and all kinds of milkshakes. My boyfriend and I came here with a hangover after partying in Vegas .After eating, we felt so much better but maybe it's because we hadn't eaten in over 17 hours. The burgers were so juicy and delicious. I was whatever about the fries ( because all fried potatoes generally taste the same  to me ). I had the Shack Stack Burger ( I think that's what they call it ). It's basically a burger with a fried portabella mushroom in it that has cheese inside the mushroom as well. Food was messier than I expected but they had plenty of napkins so I didn't complain. I forgot what the other burger my boyfriend had was called , but it was the one with bacon. Both were really good. Price is reasonable and fills you up pretty nicely. I want to say that besides Earl's, this place is my favorite go to in Vegas for affordable food.",

Yes the price is a bit high, but we are talking about the Las Vegas Strip and half that price was for the 64oz of Dos Equis.  There wasn't much of a line when we arrived but the dining room was packed.  We waited for a table and were able to snag one before our food came out, people weren't lingering at the tables so don't let the crowded place scare you away.

The cheese is not overbearing and your fries are still crispy even though there is cheese on top of them. The decor is modern and lively with lots of seating. The staff is friendly and well managed. I'll make sure to come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "After trying Shake Shack for my first time and all the hype I have to say this is my fave burger joint now. I had the single Shack burger and it was full of grill flavor plus the beef patty was seasoned well. The bun was a different texture and flavor than your usual burger places as it was very soft. Just something about it that makes me want more of it. I also tried the chicken nuggets and they were moist plus actual chicken pieces rather than the McD's one which sometimes make me wonder what I'm eating. They provide two big dipping sauces which was more than enough.  The other item I tried was the coffee shake and it was very rich in flavor with a good thick texture. It was a good size at not being too big or small. Overall the only things I wish they could improve was that the portion size of the burger was a bit small even though the Shack burger came with all the usual ingredients plus for what you paid I'm not sure it was all worth it as it was more expensive than your usual burger places, but for it being on the LV strip that might have added to the cost too.",

Few minute wait to order then 5 minutes to get our food. Since it was our first visit ever, we went basic bitch and got Shack Burgers and regular fries. I was planning to get a regular chocolate or strawberry shake; however, when I found out the strawberry cookies n cream shake had Golden Oreo pieces, I was sold.  The burger and fries were amazing and cooked to perfection. The shake... SO THICK, so let it melt a bit if you want to use the straw. Although this meal basically used all my calories for the day, it was so worth it.  Clean restaurant, a guy picked up our empty tray from the inside dining room, and everyone was friendly.",

I didn't really think the burgers were that great and they were pretty small and pricey.  Ice cream cone wasn't all that either, mcdonald ice cream cones are better than that.  But the strawberry milkshake was pretty good I give them that.   Also our little buzzer went off saying our food was ready but yet I still waited at the counter for it for almost 15 minutes.    Overall I don't think I would recommend this place due to the over priced food and lack of quality of the food.  But it is a pretty nice in the inside.",

What we ordered: Shroom Burger, Chicken Shack, Double down fries, chocolate custard (ice cream) and lemonade drink (husband had a drink with ginger in it, forgot the name!)  Shroom is good for vegetarian and for health conscious. It's doesnt have the nasty veggie taste so you'll be fine dont worry! Chicken Shack was soooooo good as well as the double down fries (it has some bacon, cheese and red bell pepper to give it a little twist, not spice!)  Custard ice cream was so good so better to order 1 if there's only 2 of you who'll be eating. You'll be sooooo full after eating the burger and fries.  Lemonde and Ginger drink are both good, just get more ice since its too flavorful.  I've never been to New York Shake Shack but hey! this Vegas branch has something to say!",

My boyfriend and I ordered and split the Shake Stack and Chocolate Brownie Shake! The Shake Stack was super! I really enjoyed the portobello mushroom they added to the burger. My boyfriend who has eaten here before said he didn't think the Shake Stack was worth the extra $'s compared to the ShackBurger. He enjoyed it but liked the ShackBurger more. Since I've never had the ShackBurger I can't say much, but I thought that the extra amount was worth it for the portable lol mushroom they added. Regardless, I'm sure you can go wrong with either of them! The fries were alright! I didn't think they were anything special, but I still enjoyed them. I don't think they had ranch, so unfortunately we were only able to get ketchup. The Chocolate Brownie Shake was really good though! I really enjoyed it. It was super rich and chocolate-y, so some may not like that it's so sweet.  I'm sure I will come back to eat one of their burgers the next time I see one of their locations!",

Yes they sell burgers, fries, and milkshakes but I feel like you just can't really compare the two. For one, the price difference is crazy. You can get a cheeseburger at In and Out for a little over $2 whereas a cheeseburger at Shake Shack is about $6. There are more options at Shake Shack (I personally love the Shroom burger) and they even sell hot dogs!   Their burgers are amazing, get the Shake Stack. It's their cheeseburger with shroom burger combined. The fried portobello with the cheese oozing out is amazing. The portobello is coated and deep fried making is super crunchy. The meat is grilled nicely and seasoned well. The buns are toasted to perfection. The only thing was that the burger was so small..  Fries are a must here! They are fried to a perfect golden brown perfection and served with just enough salt. Get the fries with cheese will make it x100 better.   Shakes are thick, sweet and creamy. Same with their custard. Hope they open more locations in the west coast!!",

    "text": "From serving burgers and shakes from a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park, this infamous stand up shop flourished into a spectacular establishment for all of you foodie junkies out there. On the West Coast, In-N-Out is still the burger joint for many of us, but it seems that Shake Shack has taken it's presence across the country to Sin City. A place where anything can happen and the extraordinary happens on the daily!   We came to Vegas ready to get chocolate wasted and to also experience new cravings in this lavish metropolitan. After a long night of heavy liquor consumption, we decided to get a hangover cure at Shake Shack. We walked from our hotel to the restaurant and immediately saw a line from afar. Luckily for us, the wait wasn't too excruciating.  The inside decor had a retro dining look to it. I felt like I was back back in the 70's about to toss some quarters in the disco jukebox. Groovy and rustic!  The menu had a variety of selections compared to In-N-Out. With an assortment of hot dogs, burgers, frozen custard, wines, and shakes, it seems as if there was an endless food pairings to order from. I love the idea of having bacon and fried shallots in my burger. A crunchy and wow factor that was missing from your typical beef pattie and bun. I had mentioned to our cashier that I would like grilled onions in there as well, but he told me they don't serve that ingredient here. It was a bummer since I friggn love caramelized onions, but I guess the shallots and bacon will suffice.   It took about 10 minutes for our order to be ready. I came up to grab my order and laid eyes upon the gorgeous looking burger. The vibrant and colorful ingredients bursting out of these toasted buns were a delightful sight to embark upon. These golden crinkle-cut fries just made this combo meal a whole lot tastier.   My verdict on this meal was nothing but awesome! It may not be a double-double but it sure is a contender in the books! It's the fresh and high quality ingredients they use that makes this place a reckon to be mess with. The beef patty was savory, tomatoes were plump and juicy and don't get me started on the hot crispy fries. It was a pleasure getting aquatinted with this marvelous master piece. And for the price, it was well worth every penny!   Highly recommend to anyone who loves a good burger. It's dining establishments like this that will keep business open for the foodie elites out there!",

I arrived there about 11:30 a.m. right before the busy crowd,  There was not a wait at all- I looked at the menu beforehand and knew what I wanted to try.  I ordered the Shake Burger with pickles and onions in addition to the tomato and lettuce.  I also ordered a glass of white house wine around $9.50 including tax.  She came back with what I consider a HALF glass of wine.  I said to her goodness that is a REAL short pour of wine.  She explained that she is instructed to pour to half of the indent in the plastic glass.  I said OK can you ring up another wine so I dont have to wait  to order another one when the crowd comes in?  She did and she actually gave me a bit more on the second glass which was gracious of her.  ($9.50 inc. tax is a TOTAL RIP OFF for what I measured out to be a 4 oz pour of wine - normal pours are 5oz)    My burger came out pretty darn quickly since it was before the rush  so the service was fast.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  It was OK tasting but it was dry but I have had much better.  The flavor was meh and for $5.99,  I expected more.  If you want a fast food burger and that's all, you would be OK with this place however, with all of the choices of places to  get your carbs and calories in Vegas, I recommend going somewhere else.  DONT ORDER THE WINE - next door they have HH specials for 1/2 off drinks.  Get your burger to go and get your drinks somewhere else!!!!!",

I got the Smoke Shack burger, crinkle cut cheese fries, and a chocolate milkshake. My burger was good, bun wasn't too flimsy, and not overcooked, but tasted like a normal restaurant quality burger to me. The cheese fries were also really good and I usually don't like crinkle cut fries, but the ones here were still crispy even though it was underneath a layer of melted cheese. My chocolate milkshake was good too, but it was very thick. Probably too thick for my liking because I had to scoop it like icecream to eat it and not drink it like a milkshake.  I'd recommend this place! Definitely get the crinkle cut cheese fries!",

We were able to snag a shared table inside.  It was my friend's first time here, and she liked the burgers better than In 'n Out because the buns were so soft.  I still think In 'n Out is better, but this is a close second.  Crinkle cut fries are better here than the fries at In 'n Out - got it with cheese on the side for an extra $1.  I didn't get a shake, but my friends did and I had a sip.  The chocolate taste more like a cross between a milk and dark chocolate, so it wasn't too sweet, nor was it too thick.  It was actually pretty good.  If the line hadn't been so long, I would have tried a custard dessert at the end.  They also don't do grilled onions, which they should totally add!  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be back!",

I didn't mind standing, baking in the heat as the line slowly inched its way forward into the venue. They have a huge menu (literally) put up so you can ponder your order as you approach the cash register. They even have dog friendly options! I ordered the Shack Stack and a side of fries. A friend suggested to get the cheese sauce on the side so I can dip the fries in it, which was a genius idea by the way. I don't like soggy fries. What I didn't realize was that the portobello mushroom was fried, which was a little excessive but the burger was still good. The combination of the patty and mushroom was one I had never tasted before. Very savory and I could barely finish the fries. Next time I'll just split them. I have to try the shakes next time too but 10000% very satisfied with my first experience and I will make an attempt to stop by every Vegas trip from now on!!!",

I ordered a cheeseburger (with shake sauce),  crinkle cut fries, and a large lemonade all for $12 bucks.   The Shake Shack is located right in front of the New York New York hotel, right off of Las Vegas Blvd. The location is awesome, and I love the atmosphere. The seating inside the restaurant is pretty cool. It's made to look like a fast food place, but they give you buzzers when you order so you can sit down and wait for your food. The seating area is nice, and they have a bunch of big screen T.V's with sports on them to keep you busy.   The cheeseburger with shake sauce was absolutely amazing. It definitely has a home made hamburger feel and taste. The vegetables were fresh. The bun was soft, and the meat was soft and tasty.  The crinkle cut fries were cooked perfectly. Not too crunchy, and not too soft! They are fresh made fries. The lemonade went well with the meal.   I would definitely eat here again!",

The line moves quickly and you can pick from the large menu that is right in front of you.   I went big and got a burger, fries and a shake.   The burger was less sloppy and more tasty than In and Out, the fries are great and crinkle cut which is my favorite type and the shake was very good (got peanut butter). Overall it was a great experience and I'd totally go back again.   Obviously this is not a typical McDonalds-like joint and the prices are elevated. The shake definitely could have been cheaper.

Staff didn't seem to care that none of their soda had any carbonation. We were in there eating for a half an hour and they never bothered to fix it even after customer after customer complained. They screwed up our shake order as well. Multiple customers brought back screwed up orders back and they didn't seem to care. That's a lot of food waste. The burgers and fries were good, but not having anything to wash them down with stunk. I hope this was an off night for them. Will definitely try another location back home in Arizona because the food was definitely delicious. Not sure I'd go back here since they don't care because most of their customers are probably from out of state and there just for a visit.",

    "text": "Prelims: not really a shack and they're more than just about shakes. My wife told me about this place and my first instinct was to be really confused why a burger joint would be called shake shack. The interior is a bit crowded (probably because of all the fricking PEOPLE that are all up in this joint) but there are lots of tables and chairs, even outside. It's located in New York New York (because this shack started in NY - probably the one place they could fit a restaurant) and it's outside in a humongous sign so it's very easy to see. Like most fast food joints, there isn't really a service other than getting your food, which took a little bit, but goddam was it worth it.  My wife and I ordered the burger and fries, along with a salted caramel hot chocolate (hey, I asked if she wanted a shake...and she wanted the hot chocolate. So the review has the hot chocolate. And not the shake. From Shake Shack...). The burger was unimaginably delicious. The umami, mixed with the beautiful acidity of the ketchup, the crispness of the vegetables, the soft and oh-so-buttery and flaky brioche bun, all combining to drop an absolute bomb of flavor in my mouth. The only disappointing thing was that the burger was a bit small so I ended up inhaling only half (between my wife and I) and I wanted more and more and more. In retrospect, I should have said to hell with what we had planned and to eat here instead. The fries were crinkle cut (my favorite!!!!) and super crispy with a deliciously flaky potato center. This meal was exactly what I want to eat. And it blows that it's all the way in Vegas!  TL;DR Damn good burgers. Shake Shack is better than In-N-Out. Burn me.",

At least m life members can get points on shack shake orders! Bring your receipt to the m life counter to get your purchase associated to your account.   Here's the scoop.. - fifty fifty drink: half ice tea and lemonade tasted like nothing  - shackcago dog: soggy bun, interesting toppings with cucumber, peppers, relish but I'd eat a Costco hotdog over this - smoke shack: cold toppings were awkward in the burger. I can imagine the regular cheeseburger being really tasty though without the extra fluff toppings. You probably need to eat 2 burgers to be full. 1 is kinda small but perfect for a light snack/meal - vanilla custard: ok, kind of melting before it even touched the outside warm las Vegas air. Reminded me of McDonalds soft serve. I'd probably prefer McDonalds.   Really wanted to love this place but I'm not seeing the specialty. Perhaps this is more of a childhood memory, nostalgia type of grandness that I don't know about yet like White Castle.",

There were a lot of people in line but service was friendly & quick! It looked like there were at least 15 workers in the kitchen hauling ass like no other resulting in the speedy production of my meal.   I ordered the following--  Single ShackBurger ($5.19): I LOVED my burger! The patty was SO JUICY and had a really fresh taste, the bun was perfect, and the tomato & lettuce were fresh & crisp.   Cheese fries ($3.95): weren't that special imo but my coworker loved them & ate all of mine.   Black & white shake ($5.25): yummy, but it's just vanilla & chocolate so I'll def have to try one of their Concretes next time.   I like that this place has plenty of outdoor seating although the current view is a partial Strip view + Las Vegas Arena construction. Indoor seating is spacious as well but fills up quickly during lunchtime.   PS - MGM employees receive a discount! Just show your ID. Forgot how much the discount is exactly... but something is always better than nothing! :)",

I've never heard my daughter ask to come back before we've even finished the meal. She's never eaten the burger before the fries even... Never! She even commented on the fact that before we leave we have to eat there one more time. Guess it's a sure fire hit and a sign that we will be back.",

Once you order, they give you a device that vibrates, symbolizing that your order is ready for pick up at the counter.    The burger was good.  The bun was moist and fresh.  The mushroom was perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  The fries were a bit of a let down.  Crinkle cut fries are second on my list for the least desirably cut french fries.  My number one dislike is thick potato wedges.  I do not like crinkle cut fries because they tend to get soggy, and  rarely, have I had them crispy.  The cheese made things even worse.  There was also a weird taste to the cheese.  Imagine nacho cheese with a curd-like texture.  It was just strange.    The shake was definitely the star of the meal.  This was one of the best shakes I have ever had.  It was thick and very enjoyable til the last drop.    Overall, I would recommend this place just to try.  All it is really, is a glorified In N' Out.",

I was pleasantly surprised that when I arrived, the line wasn't very long and moved quickly. There was plenty of seating inside or outside.  SmokeShack Burger - cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and shacksauce. The burger was as good as I remember with a little kick.   Cheese Fries - crinkle cut fries topped with a special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce. While I thought the fries were good, I would prefer to just get the regular fries next time.  I also tried the peach lemonade and it was so refreshing on a hot day!   If you're in Las Vegas, you should stop by Shake Shack for a great burger.",

    "text": "Burger Battle Royale... with Cheese.  I love In-n-Out and now I love Shake Shack too! Aww! It's like the Biggie & Tupac battle, except I don't think this will end in blood shed.   Came here for a Social Media meet up which also happened to be my first time at Shake Shack, ever, and what I noticed right off the bat was the layout. This place looks nothing like a fast food restaurant, much more modern and clean, which is surprising for a place right on the Strip. SS offers a lot of space to sit inside and two different outdoor seating areas, fully equipped with misters for those brain burning one hundred plus degree Vegas days.   We ordered a ton food, Shack Burgers, Shack Stacks, Cheese fries, Shack-Cago dogs, and a Few Concretes. First off, Shake Shack kills it on presentation alone. The food looks amazing and is stacked with bright and colorful veggies, the perfect sear on the patty, and lots of Shack Sauce. Gotta have Shack Sauce.   The Shack Burger is the perfect American cheeseburger. A thick patty, SS sauce and cheese. Cooked perfect and the buns are not only delicious carby pillows, but also connected on one end to avoid any filling from sliding out the back. Perfect burger for the SS skeptic.   The Shack Stack is the same burger, but with a fried Portobello mushroom inside that's stuffed with cheese. This was my favorite of the entire meal, the mushroom was perfectly cooked and the fry coating on it was amazing.   The Shack-Cago dog was very good, but fell apart as you ate it. Still the flavor was there, pickles, onions, tomato, sauce, and the bun. Great alternate meal option if you're feeling a burger at the moment.   The cheese fries were okay, and I didn't try the concrete. I'm just not into sweets.   In-n-out or Shake Shack? The burger at Shake Shack is better, by far, but In-n-Out has the fry game on lock. In my mind, this is a straight burger tie.   I guess I'll just have to eat at each place again and keeping trying to break that tie. Oh the perils of Yelp life.",

In-N-Out is your typical burger that's just made fresh and with high quality, so it's a classic. Shack Shack I feel is a more high-end burger place, as you can see from it's higher pricing. They have more variety in the types of burgers on their menu, including the Shack Stack, which is what I ordered. It's a cheeseburger and a 'shroom burger (crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses) put together. So freakin' good. The cheese just oozes out of the mushroom when you bite into it and it's amazing. I'm usually not a fan of mushrooms but this made me a fan!  In addition, I got the crinkle cut fries. Shake Shack differs from most burger places because they have crinkle cut fries instead of just regular french fries. At first I was hesitant to get some because I'm not really a fan of crinkle cut. I feel like they're too soft and potato-y. However, these fries were pretty good! They were fried to a level of perfect crispness, unlike most crinkle cut fries.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Shake Shack. It's probably not a place that I would go to all the time due to the slightly high prices for a simple burger and fries. However, I will definitely come back when I feel like indulging a little.",

I tried the cheeseburger on day #1, which was fatty, juicy, and delicious.  Bread was on the sweet side.  Crinkle fries were fun, although I'm not as into the cheesy ones.  Shakes were crazy delicious.    Day #2 I opted for the mushroom burger (well just a mushroom, no meat).  I like grilled portabella, not so much deep fried but if you like fried things and are a veggie lover you would probably enjoy it.

If the weather is cooler, which it wasn't when we went, you can sit outside where there is lots of shade & cute seats.   I was overwhelmed with the menu since it was my first time! I got the regular hamburger with their signature sauce, a chocolate PB shake & I shared fries with my friend. My first bite was heaven, it was like biting into something so delicious that you are torn between eating it all or savoring it forever. Shakes were off the hook! You can do a combination of their flavors. & lets not forget crinkle cut fries which were both crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside. The couple I was with ordered 3 sandwiches & loved all of them. People from Hawaii go all out when it comes to food because we want to try everything.   The staff at this location were so patient & sweet especially when I was still deciding what I wanted. When we were done they even offered to take out trays!   This is a must when in Vegas!",

    "text": "Shake shack has a really cool concept. I was in Las Vegas for a one nighter and walked by thinking I have to try this place I've heard so much about. Got the shake shack stack with the fries mushroom and burger with the crinkle fries. The price for portion was decent. The food came out quick as each burger was made to order. Biting into my burger it was scorching hot (temp) I loved the freshness. All though I like the mushroom on the burger I think I'd prefer them separately as the shroom didn't break as you're biting into it causing a bit of a mess. Although the combination worked fine it got messy. Lastly I'd go without the sauce. Given it lacked a bit of taste to me. Overall great place for a burger, very big space and has several drink options. I'd like to go back and try a few other items as I had to get up and work early the next day.",

    "text": "O-ver-ra-ted. *clap* *clap* *clapclapclap*.  Make that... overrated and over-hyped. Other than In-N-Out, I wasn't looking to a particular place in Vegas more than Shake Shack. Clearly, I was disappointed. While my pictures may make you think \"Damn, that looks good...\", don't let them deceive you. The fries? Simple crinkle cut may-as-well-be-frozen fries. Not bad, not good, they're whatever. They have a cheese sauce they put on them, but I'm pretty confident it's the same radioactive goop you'd find on your nachos at a carnival or baseball game or what have you.  The burger was decent, thought the patty was fast food patty/paper thin. For the price, I expected a lot more. My Shack Stack was a little salty, and almost tasted more like a grilled cheese with lettuce and tomato more than a burger. The Shack Stack has a fried portabello and cheese patty looking thing on it, which is set on top of a burger patty... the problem is, that pretty much overpowers the wafer thin hamburger. Was it bad? No, not at all, but factoring in my expectation, what people say about the place, and the price, I don't feel inclined to revisit.   My girlfriend's Jackpot ice cream or shake or blizzard or whatever they call it was pathetic in appearance ... half melted and not loaded with toppings like suggested. Despite that, it was very good, and the best thing I had at Shake Shack.  Shake Shack may well taste amazing after a long night of drinking in Vegas, but as a sober guy just looking for a midnight snack, Shake Shack just didn't cut it for me... not to mention Shake Shack (as of July 1st) doesn't honor room charges. Boo... $20 for a mediocre meal.",

Now, in n out spread or McDonald's Big Mac sauce, you'll know what they are which is what I was hoping for from shake shack.  I'm not a burger person either, so a burger really has to be that good and stand out for me to say \"it's awesome\"! This place is just okay, but I'm willing to give it a second chance!",

Being from California, maybe I'm a little biased because honestly, In-N-Out is literally right down the street from me. But Shake Shack is my special lovely mistress from Las Vegas.   New York New York hotel now charges for parking, although the first hour is free. You'll need more than that to rest after stumbling on over hungover in the heat. It seems to always be pretty busy, so snagging a table was excruciatingly depressing. Have someone scout for a table while someone else orders for them.   I always get the good old Shack Burger, no need for fancy toppings. The bun is fluffy but not mushy, the patty is perfectly soft. It just looks kinda soggy and underwhelming, but the taste is perfect to me. They have other options as well, such as a veggie burger with portobello instead of a patty.   I dislike the fries here, as I like my fries on the crispier side. My friend ordered the cheese fries and they were SUPER salty. Between the five of us we couldn't finish it. My friend also ordered the Oreo shake, personally it was way too sweet for me but I'd give the shakes another chance.   The great thing about Shake Shack is that there's a lot of menu options, and alcoholic options as well. Shake Shack has stolen my heart and although their food can be mediocre, nothing beats their burgers as a hangover cure.",

That being said, if you've experienced other Shake Shacks in New York, DC, or elsewhere, this one comes off as, well, trying too hard.  It's trying too hard to be like New York in Las Vegas. Even to the point of being attached to the gaudy New York, New York. They've got a giant video wall that seems to play nothing but endless loops of New York and talks about all the local ingredients that other Shake Shacks use but not at this location.  When I went it was about 1:30pm on a weekday. The restaurant was packed, but the line was manageable and after some stalking I was able to get a seat. The burger was what you would expect from Shake Shack, which is to say, quite good. However, I was flummoxed by trying order two different beers and then a root beer, none of which were actually around. That was disappointing.  If you've never been to a Shake Shack, this is nice - well, if you discount the usual Vegas clientele. But if you've experienced a Shake Shack somewhere else you're better off trying another one of Vegas' many delicious burger restaurants.",

Located on the outskirts of the New York New York Casino, this brightly lit place is definitely a tourist trap for those of us unfamiliar with the Shake Shack franchise. The menu is pretty basic with burgers, fries, hot dogs, and shakes. I opted for the basic cheeseburger with fries and I was super disappointed. The burger was smaller than a McDonald's dollar burger and was not very well seasoned. As for the fries, they were definitely those frozen crinkle fries, which again were super basic. I was so let down with my entire meal after everyone who had eaten at Shake Shack on the East Coast claimed it was on the same level as In-N-Out. Overall, if you're looking for a delicious burger experience and have a car, you might as well save a couple bucks and go to the In-N-Out down the street from the Strip.",

Trying to now be consistent about reviews, I'll break them down by: Cost, Service, Ambience, Food/Drink, Random Thoughts.  Cost: $10-$20  Service: There are lines. Wow. Now you may be saying, gosh Mike, obviously. The most popular east coast burger chain just opened on the single busiest street in the world...I understand that, but I guess when I knew they were opening on a corner spot on the Strip I figured they would have MORE THAN FOUR CASHIERS. I went to the smallest Shake Shack in NYC and they still had 3 cashiers...  Ambience: It's fine. Seating is hard to find sometimes but it seems that they have a patio that will open up during summer which will be fun! They also have the silly roulette themed lights, which I guess add to the decor but are in all honesty probably a waste of money.   Food: Burgers are great, charred and super! Fries are great especially with cheese. I thought the hot dogs were underwhelming and lacking the \"snap\" the you associate with a great hot dog. The main selling point for me has always been the Concretes. The two Vegas ones are great, but anytime you can add cheesecake bites, chocolate, cookie dough, or whatever else into some delicious custard, you got a recipe for hitting a jackpot! (HA! A bad pun!). They also have a \"C\" line for cold items which will be really solid when the temps hit 100.  Random: There is no casino entrance. I thought it may be more efficient to park at the Monte Carlo and cross the strip that way than parking at the NYNY and walking through the entire casino. Just food for thought.",

The instant I saw Shake Shack driving down the Strip, it was the only thing I could think about...I knew I had to try it and this was my chance!!!  Couple hours later I was in line and very happy for the veggie options and got the portobello mushroom burger & the cheese fries. As the buzzer rang and I went to go get my food I was immediately struck by the portions being definitely on the smaller side, I paid 10+ bucks for this, I thought, let's see if the taste makes up for the sizes & long story short I was left underwhelmed. The burger it's self was decent, the flavor is there - it's very cheesy as the portobello is stuffed with cheese but the buns threw me off and looked very cheap and dry and the veggies inside didn't seem that fresh. The cheese fries were good, covered in a velveeta-like substance, not spectacular in any way shape or form, but good, passable I would say, is the word to describe them. In summary this place is VERY overhyped, after eating loads of In & Out & Super Duper Burgers...Shake Shack has nothing on either, esp. on Super Duper Burgers. If you want to spend $10 on a burger meal 100% go to Super Duper Burgers if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area and see what real quality burger meal tastes like ( & get the garlic fries and see how cheesy fries should really taste.)",

    "text": "I came here two days in a row!   I came on my first day Monday, July 6. It was pouring rain and super windy outside as we arrived. Inside the place, it was dripping in areas from the rain. I ordered the Smoke Shack single with Fries and a Rootbeer on draft. Smoke Shack has to be requested to get lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles on it. If you forgot to mention or ask about that, you'll just get the meat, cheese, bacon, special sauce, cherry peppers n buns. The fries are so fresh and crispy cooked just right! The Rootbeer, I didn't like. It tasted flat so I had to return it and get another soft beverage. I tried a taste of their peach lemonade, it was way too tart. I went with Coke, to be on the safe bet.   The following day, I went on Tuesday July 7. No rain, no leaking roofs this visit. It looked like things were back to normal. I figured to order a double this time (Smoke Shack Double), cheesy fries, and their desert. The double was waaayyyy too much for me, I was better off with the one patty, took me forever to finish it and it tasted less cheesy with double the meat and veggies. The cheesy fries we're soo delicious, I wanted to get more but was getting full from my double cheeseburger, and wanted to save room for ice cream custard.   For desert, ordered two different ones to try. My favorite was the white one (All Shook Up), as the other (Jackpot) was too sweet with the strawberry syrup. I would order just the concrete (custard) all those other flavors were making it less creamy and complicated for my taste buds as I didn't think the mixings blended really good together.   Oh yes, this place is constantly busy. It will die down for maybe 5-10 mins and the line quickly gets packed again. They do really well for seating though, because a lot of the people just eat and leave. They give you buzzers, and so you grab your food when it goes off. Staffs are really helpful in removing your plate/trash. Bathrooms are clean and well stocked. There's only one sink though in ladies, which is a bummer to wait to use to wash your hands after you use the toilet. Great place to check out and be a total pig!",

Because I saw a short-ish line, I decided to check it out as it's something I've always wanted to check out and I'm glad I did!!  I ordered the Smoked burger (with bacon & cheese) and a half tea/half lemonade drink.  I really enjoyed their bun and I'm not usually one to eat buns out of a burger.  But their bread was nice and soft!!!  The burger was also really really good.  I like the fact that the patty wasn't too salty.  They did, however, overdo it with the peppers on my burger (I definitely do recommend a bit...but they completely overwhelmed my burger with the hot peppers - so much that I had to scoop some out).  Also, that half & half drink is a must try!!!   Would definitely go back to try something else again!",

Located at the New York New York hotel, you can't miss it from the street. It is BEAUTIFUL at night with its glittery letters and bright lights! Anyway, I actually really liked this venue better than the one I went to in NY. There's LOTS of indoor & outdoor seating, televisions for sports games, and the line moves super quick!! I would seriously consider driving 4hrs just to get Shake Shack again. I am craving it now as I type this review..  I usually just order their version of a regular cheeseburger (cuz I don't like mushrooms). But I LOVE IT. Seriously, the bread they use is so soft and everything in the burger tastes good.  I also order cheese fries because it's BOMB. Ask for the cheese on the side though, for dipping. A perfect meal. I wish I had one closer to home (please open one in LA!!).",

In the end, it doesn't matter since both places make an excellent burger.   If you're the first time ordering and you like spicy, I would suggest a Shake with chilies (it's more of a relish).   It's OUT OF THIS WORLD.   Personally, I'm drooling when I think about it.   Also there shakes are pretty darn good (try them all).   A little more on the pricey end of a fast foodish burger place but you won't be disappointed.  Get the: Shake with chillies (off menu, have to ask for it)",

This is not your typical burger joint, these guys don't fit into a cookie cutter category and if you've had Shake Shack you know what I mean. Each burger is made of 100% Natural Angus beef and served on a non-GMO potato roll. You can ask for your choice of lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion and I believe there's no up charge. With that I always get their famous crinkle cut fries with cheese. Ohhh mah gaw, shut the front door! These fries make my heart sing, literally my heart screams with such love and hate as it may not be the healthiest choice but it's darn tasty!! Excuse me while I wipe away my drool...  And I'm back...  Customer Service is so good, too! Those working at the counters aren't rude or rushing to take your order like other like establishments.   The Shackmeister Ale is also a tasty one which is brewed by Brooklyn Brewery.   This review could go on and on about how much love I have for the Shake Shack brand but I'll end it here and hopefully I've convinced you just how much you should fly to your nearest Shake Shack, I believe SoCal has the nearest location to Hawaii. They are coming further west so let's hope Hawaii is on their next destination list.",

    "text": "Shake Shack is located outside New York, New York. Very appropriate. If you're coming from the parking lot, just head towards the Village Streets. Like all places in Vegas, there is a wait. Unlike Earl's, the line does not disappear as quickly. Good news is that it gives you enough time to think over the menu. There is a lot of outdoor and indoor seating.  Shroom Burger is my sandwich of choice. Oh man, the the taste of the ooey gooey cheese and mushroom juice when you bite into the patty - so great. But if you have a bigger appetite, you might need two or a bigger burger option.. or add a milkshake, fries, or a soft serve. The bill will stack up.",

Man, that shack sauce is amazing! Garlicky & creamy... it goes perfectly with the angus beef and soft and slightly sweet bun.   1 single cheeseburger, 1 order of crinkle cut fries and 1 fountain drink will set you back about $10. Pricey for fast food burgers, but worth the price b/c of the quality of ingredients they use. You can taste the delicious beefy goodness.  My only gripe about this location they should work out a better system with cranking out their burgers. We waited about 15 minutes for our food and when we got it, the burgers were luke warm. Probably been sitting out for a while and no one buzzed us. Boo.",

With the weather there it is definitely something that is refreshing and cool you off. It was a little bit too sour in my opinion but I can't really complain since its lemonade haha.  SHACK STACK: With taxes, this burger was was about $10! And really, all it really is is a ShackBurger (~$6) with a cheesed filled portobello mushroom. I find it kinda outrageous how with an addition of a cheese filled mushroom can be $4. Other than that, the burger buns were delicious. I think its Hawaiian bread! +1 and its everything you can expect in a burger. I forgot to ask if they had pickles though. It was a good burger, don't get me wrong, but it was not a $10 worthy burger.  FRENCH FRIES: Nothing really special about the fires. Not too salty or soggy. Just munching on some potatoes.  CUSTARD: I wanted the mint chocolate custard but they told me that they ran out of it so they already had moved onto the following weeks' special custards which was Boston Cream PIe. It had a nice consistency with a subtle flavor. Not too overwhelming.",

    "text": "Disappointment.  I remember when Shake Shack first opened and everyone was super super excited. I made sure I came in to try this place out (if you know me, you know my obsession of burgers). The whole interior and exterior design is beautiful. You seriously cannot miss it. The restaurant front is right on the Strip at New York New York. The signage is huge and clear with their outside patio area. Then you get in and everything is super modernized and very attractive.  Anyway, many people compare Shake Shack with In-N-Out (Shake Shack being the East Coast burger joint, and In N Out being the west side's). First off... 1. In n Out prices are way more affordable. Shake Shake's prices are pretty high for practically mini burgers, and the fries come with so little as well. The size and price dont match up. 2. In n Out's simplicity and their signature sauce is just so original and yummy, Shake Shack is okay...and really salty if you ask me..   I dont know, MY OPINION: not a huge fan of Shake Shack. Maybe I came on a bad day and need to give it another try, but as for my first impression, ehhh ill stick to In N Out - the west coast original!!",

It's more like a Five Guys or In n Out.    You can order single or double burgers, I like their crinkle cut fries and it's really good to get it with cheese sauce.  The cheese is a blend of 2 cheeses and is delicious. They were giving samples while I stood in line and they definitely sold me on it.    The burgers are messy looking which I think they do on purpose.  Makes you feel like you're getting a yummy down and dirty burger.  It's actually great quality beef and veggies and the buns are also unique. The patties are really tasty and I service was quick.    At this location in Las Vegas most of the cashier's seemed happy and helpful but my particular cashier seemed very disinterested.  She wasn't outgoing or nice, just took my order without really smiling or repeating it back.    Other than that, I could see myself craving Shake Shack, I also want to try their shakes next time.  Good tasty burger that is quick but way better than fast food.  You definitely want to try it to see how they stack up against the other big names in this same genre.  I really enjoyed it.",

That process is solved with a vibrating thingy you can take to any free table you like... if there are free tables... just like at In-N-Out.

When I discovered there was not only one in Vegas, but one in NYNY, where I was staying, was a dream come True.  I ate here all three days of our trip. I had three different burgers. I fell in love.  The Smokeshack was my least favorite of the burgers. Bacon always feels like an unwanted after thought on burgers and even though they tried to balance it with acidic peppers it was still lack luster. The Shackburger is a perfect representation of a classic burger. The soft bun melts away, the burger has a crisp skin and tastes of steak, the toppings are in perfect harmony. The crown jewel of Shake Shack is the Shackmeister burger. Topped with their delicious fried shallots, cheese, and shack sauce. Perfection. Their Fries are deceiving, they look like crappy school lunch fries but they are crisp on the outside and pillowy soft inside. Cover them with cheese sauce because you are in Vegas!  They also serve beer here and no matter what we ordered we were always undercharged for the beer. I guess it was out lucky day.",

I ordered a single stack smokehouse burger, a small order of crinkle cut fries, and a chocolate peanut butter chocolate shake.  The burger had a very nice, well cooked flavor, but I found the size to be a bit lacking . The fries were excellent with a crispy texture and the shake was pretty good too!

His came correct, mine came plain (absolutely naked). Went back up front and they kindly remade it. When I finally bite in it was... blah. Poorly dressed (almost no sauce). Fries were unremarkable freezer type crinkle cut. Based on that it would get 2 stars.   But about 3 hours later I got chills and nausea. Called my buddy and he said ... dude I think I'm sick, I feel warm and sick to my stomach.   All we ate today was the burger so that's it. Nausea passed in about 5 hours but still queasy as I type this.  No chance I would give these people a second chance.   Avoid, like the plauge... or you may get the plauge. :(",

    "text": "I steer clear of the burger wars.  I'll let people with more skin in the game argue over whether In & Out, Five Guys, Habit, or some other fast-casual chain ultimately comes out on top.  I'll say this, though: Shake Shack is freakin' delicious.  First of all, I'm embarrassed that it took me until 2015 to finally eat at Shake Shack.  I dropped by their Las Vegas location (in front of New York New York) for an early lunch.  There was a short line but it moved quickly.  I had a Shackburger (with added pickle and onions), a small side of crinkle cut fries, and a \"Shack Attack\" concrete (chocolate custard with fudge sauce and chocolate truffle cookie dough).  The food was ready for pick-up within 5 minutes, and in my belly in something like 3 milliseconds.  It was that good.  The burger was juicy, the fries were crispy, and the concrete was decadent.  I left Shake Shack feeling very, very happy.  Prices are some of the best on the Strip.  No up-charges to speak of.  I can't think of anyplace else on the Strip where you can get this caliber of a burger for $5.  I'm pretty much obsessed with Shake Shack now.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll skip so-called \"fine dining\" and eat all my meals here instead.  And I'll Instagram the results in obnoxious detail (natch).  Better yet: Shake Shack could open up a San Diego location.  That would be nice......",

The Shack Stack (best pronounced in an exaggerated Chicago accent) is the ultimate.  It stacks the regular Shack Burger together with the cheesy Mushroom Burger.  I love how their buns are U-shaped so they captured all the drippings from your burger rather than letting them escape into your hand or onto your tray.  Their crinkle-cut fries are mediocre in my opinion.  Similar to frozen stuff my mom would've heated up in the oven for us growing up.  Their order takers are always friendly and engaging, and the dining room attendants are always prompt and efficient.  The decor is really unique and fun.  We always take out of town guests here at least once per visit.",

    "text": "OK all, I do not enjoy being the lone  3 star rating in a sea of 5 star raters from truly burgerlicious yelping gurus.  I went to the NY NY Hotel today to try Shake Shack and overall, I am rating the food a solid 3 star!  First of the location ambiance and feel of the place is 5 star. I like the location right on the strip, plenty of views to see all, and outdoor seating when it get's too busy!  Location - 5 Star - As above  Ambiance - 5 Star - As above  Menu and Choices - 5 Star - Check out their menu online or on the wall. It is great.  Service - 5 Star - You have a rather large menu on the wall or laminated menus to review your plethora of choices that can be amazing.    Food - 3 star - We opted for a simple hamburger with cheese, a Shack Burger SIngle which comes with lettuce, tomato and their special sauce. and a Shack Stack with is a cheese burger with a crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and their special sauce!  I had a big bite of the Shack Burger and it was alright.  tasted nice, however it was NOT mouth watering to me. It did not perk up my senses to say, ahhh, I have arrived.  I was also surprised at the rather small size of the burger itself.  For me my main meal was the Shack Stack with both the meat and the mushroom.  When you bite into this, a gusher of warm melted cheese will ooze out and that was really great.  I found it really hard to taste the mushroom as it was fried and I thought for the longest time I had the wrong order as i could only see the mushroom and not the hamburger itself. It was there, just very thin and nearly non-existent.  I give this a three star overall for the fact that there was nothing remarkable about either burger.  The Fries - 2 Star - Much has been said about their crinkle fries, and their cheese fries. I would say that the fries were cooked just right, and at the same time, I must NOT be a fan of crinkle fries because I found myself missing the small, thin, crispy fries that many other places serve.  The cheese fries were highly recommended and it felt like someone had melted simple sliced cheese on the fries. I mean, the cheese to me had a processed taste to it. I did not get it, but you can betcha it was darn decent as I ate the entire THING!  The Bouncer - 5 star - They have a greeter at the front to give you a menu and to give you a quick idea of what to get. I thought the greeters were both amazing and very friendly!  Keep it up!  Frozen Custard, Dogs, Concretes- I cannot comment as we did not order this or any of the concretes.  I will give this a 5 star because you know that when it warms up a bit, I am gonna go for the works on these puppies!  Cold Brew - 2 star - orderd the $4.75 Cold Brew, steeped and cold pressed iced coffee brewed and bottled in Brooklyn.  They serve it in a 10.5 oz bottle. Tasted like simply cold coffee and it came in a plastic cup with a lid. Definitely not a bottle, and definitely I did not say - \"Wow, how do you make that!\"  Instead, I said \"Wow, glad I did not order that\".   OK, actually I did, however for my son.   I will be going back, as I cannot ignore all the yelpers who rave about this place. I maybe just was expecting something different. However, for now, I just don't get it!",

Having that burger, with the cheese, was definitely as good as it gets. The bun is also awesome as well. It is the spongiest bun in terms of texture that I have ever had. It meshed well with the rest of the burger. The fries are pretty good as well. I'm also not really a fan of fries too, but I have to say, they are pretty good. I also tried the peanut butter shake which was really good also. It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be, but is good to share.",

    "text": "Ok - as a restaurant consultant, I found it necessary to find out what all the talk was about at the new Shake Shack! Disappointment is an underestimation! Service - I rate a 4 out of 5. As busy as they are, their system is pretty good. The employees are polite  and, for the most part, congenial. But the food - I would rate a \"0\" out of 5. I eat at different restaurants every night of the week and include many hamburger restaurants but this is by far the worst in terms of taste, size and value.  The food was very very bland. The cheese sauce was so bland you couldn't tell it was cheese. The fries are tasteless - similar to the Frozen fries you buy at the grocery store and bake in your oven. The shake was very small for the price. All for $33. We ate at the Outback Steakhouse in Henderson the night before and had a nice steak each, wine, soup and an appetizer for $60. And we enjoyed the meal! So, overall, I would rate the whole meal .5. I guess location is everything and they have a captive clientele so will continue to survive, especially at those prices. But honestly, I would never return and for locals that don't want to be ripped off, stay away. McDonald's, Wendys, Burger King, Jack-In-The-Box, 5Guys, In and Out, etc. much better taste, much better value.",

Having a manager go around by asking how everything is and interacting with the guest was a very positive experience. You only get that kind of service at fine dining restaurants, but getting it here at a fast food burger joint was completely unexpected. Imagine you're at In-N-Out and the manager goes up to your table and follows up on your meal. Tells you a story about the business and how the history came about. Informs the menu in details. That's the service we got here from Daniel, so keep up the great work man!  As for the food, bulk up the burgers a bit...  Or change the name to Shake Shack Snack :)",

    "text": "Since the last times I've been here, I've have to say that the quality of the food has really gotten terrible. I can't remember what I said in my last review but now I can confidently say that Shake Shack comes nowhere near our good ole In N Out.   My updated review is solely for this LV location. But yeah, seems like the quality of the food has really dropped. Basically I'd say they can now be compared to maybe a Carl's Jr or Burger King meal based on the super soggy and deflated burgers my friends and I got yesterday. The only difference would be that Shake Shack's burger costs you $8-10 when you can get a similar soggy burger at Carl's Jr for half the price.   ALSO, the one thing that used to be my sole reason for liking this place... their cheese fries. We got one order of cheese fries and an order of regular fries and they came out almost exactly the same but the cheese fries having a little drip of cheese on like 4 French fries. lols If you're gonna sell an item whose only difference from regular fries is... cheese. Then I think you guys should actually have some cheese on the fries?   Bleh, overall yesterday's lunch here was super disappointing, made me feel guilty for insisting our friends come here over White Castle.   Hopefully someone from this location actually reads these reviews and tries to make some improvements, but until then... probably won't be back for awhile.",

Notice that their crinkles were deeper, so the fries were extra crispy. And you can get cheese fries as well. The burger had a good beefy flavor with a nice dark crust to it, with lettuce, tomatoes, and melty cheese. Yup. Not a big burger, but so satisfying all around. Tried their hotdog but it was just okay... nothing to go nuts over. Had some frozen custard that they call the \"Concrete,\" which was not bad too.  Located at the base of New York New York, and usually busy, Shake Shack gets a thumbs up from me! Great burgers, great fries, and probably good shakes too, lol!",

After a line out the door the previous night, we came right at opening the next day to no line but still a 20 minute wait for a single burger. Why? My husband and son each had a bite and I could not convince either to have a second, coming from two people who enjoy burgers much more then I do,  that speaks for itself.

It's the one highlight I always remember back when I was in NY.  Cheese fries - Crispy Crinkle Cut fries topped with cheesy sauce. The fries are good itself but top it off with cheese... drools.

    "text": "My east coast savvy-friends have raved about Shake Shack for a while, so needless to say I was very excited to try it out upon arriving to Vegas this weekend. And boy, it did not disappoint! Can't wait to have it again.  For a Friday afternoon in Vegas, the wait for Shake Shack was not as busy as one would think, but it was still very packed in the seating areas. We were in line to order for about 10 minutes, and were able to find a table and retrieve our food in about 15. While in line the staffmember was very helpful with familiarizing us with the menu, and even playfully invited us to compare the experience with In-N-Out (which I will get to later)!  * Food *  Our party ordered a number of yummy menu items.   Savory 1) ShackBurger - Has lettuce, tomato and Shack Sauce, and is possibly the most comparable to an In-N-Out cheeseburger. The patty is MINDBLOWINGLY delicious. I miss it already.   2) SmokeShack - A unique burger that features Shake Shack's signature red peppers. Any burger with bacon gets an A+, and this is no exception.  3) Cheese Fries - Crinkle cut fries topped with a special, creamy American and cheddar cheese sauce (TIP: Ask for bacon and red peppers on top!).  Sweet 1) Neapolitan Shake - My love asked for a combination of the strawberry, chocolate and vanilla frozen custards and they gladly complied. Possibly the best neapolitan shake I've tried.  2) Blueberry Concrete (Flavor of the Week) - A concrete is a more dense version of the shake (think McFlurry's from McDonald's... but 10x better). This concrete had blueberries mixed in and it was wonderful.  3) *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* Shack Attack Concrete - By far one of the best chocolate desserts I've ever ordered. This concrete was creamy, chocolatey, and filled with plenty of delicious mix-ins such as sprinkles, dark chocolate chunks and chocolate truffle cookie dough.    * The Verdict: Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out *  After discussing it with my friends post-meal, I have decided that the two burger chains do not invite comparison with one another bc they're in entirely different, elite leagues. SORRY if that's not what you want to hear! While their menus seem similar and their burgers are similar sizes size, their offerings, quality and taste are both on another level.  As a born and raised SoCal girl, my heart will forever love In-N-Out. There's nothing like a classic #3 hamburger, protein style with animal style fries and a chocolate shake. But their desserts do not hold a candle to Shake Shack's epic frozen treats menu. Shake Shack admittedly has a more extensive menu, so their prices do not compare to In-N-Out's affordable menu.   Overall - head to Shake Shack for more menu options and great flavor and taste, but if you're looking for simple, classic and tasty options for the best value, then In-N-Out is the way to go.",

The interior is not like your average burger joint, and almost looks more like a lounge than a restaurant.   I ended up ordering the SmokeShack burger with fries and Fifty/Fifty tea/lemonade.   Pros:   - Bacon + Cherry Peppers + ShackSauce = Yes  - Patty was deliciously smoky and flavorful  - Crinkle cut fries were probably the best crinkle cut fries I've had  - Free refills for the drinks  Cons:  - Burgers are very small  - Tea/lemonade flavor and sweetness is determined by who makes the tea as opposed to having a set recipe  - Fifty/Fifty tea was bitter w/little to no lemonade flavor I could discern  - Did I mention how small the burger was?  Although this was a pleasant experience, I do not see myself coming back anytime soon simply because it wasn't worth $14. People say quality over quantity, but Shake Shack's quantity is almost too small to overlook.",

The flavor of the burger didn't live up to the hype. I felt that inn n out had more flavor. The fries with the cheese was good.

Stopped back in on Monday evening late (again, around 9pm), and placed my order. I ordered the \"Smoke Stack\" (with bacon) and just got their regular ShackBurger, which is what I was charged for, so I can't argue.  Also got their fries and a chocolate shake.  A very basic, very greasy burger. Nowhere near the top of the list of burgers I have eaten; I was extremely disappointed that I didn't go back to Burger Bar as I had planned. Heck, In n Out would have been a better meal than this.  The shake and the fries were just OK as well, and the service was good.

She offered to let me try a sample of a 3-flavor shake to see if I'd like it--I did. The combination of chocolate, caramel and strawberry was delicious, if a bit too sweet (but what can you expect when there's caramel involved?). The ice cream shake melted extremely fast though, which was its only detraction.  The second day, I ordered a chocolate/strawberry shake and a shroom burger. The server got my shake order wrong (strawberry only), which was disappointing since chocolate is my drug of choice. The burger was tasty, if not a bit too cheesy (shocking, but True). If the cheese was milder in flavor, it might not have been too much, but the pungent taste was overpowering, and I actually like strong cheese. The melty cheese was also stuffed inside a deep-fried breaded mushroom, so it was a bit dangerous to bite into without getting splattered or burned.  Overall, it was a good burger, but what makes this place great are the shakes.",

First of all the line was long but it moved quickly. There were plenty of places to sit outside and inside. It was so crowded we did not get a place to sit inside but we did get a place to sit outside. The burger itself was very good. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger but I did not know that it did not come with lettuce and tomato. My husband ordered a double cheeseburger and that one did come with lettuce and tomato. The Fries; not that great,  they were just typical crinkled fries. Their prices extremely high for the quantity you get. Lastly, New York New York now makes you pay for parking. We were there for one hour and four minutes and we had to pay $7 for parking. So once again the burger was great it was very seasoned and tasty, the fries not so good,  the price is not so good but I do want to go back and try their shake which was almost $6.",

It tasted pretty basic for a burger.  It tasted good, but I didn't see what all the hype was about.  And its definitely not a burger that I would wait a long time in line to get.    Pros: Bun was nice, meat quality was good, and veggies were fresh.   Cons: pretty small sized burger, even for a double burger.  I was still hungry afterwards.  And the cheese tasted pretty cheap.  Cheese whiz?  Didn't do anything for the fries but make them soggy.  Crinkly Cut French Fries?  What is this, High School?  If I am paying premium, I expect better french fries.  Overpriced for what you get.    I would rather have In-N-Out, Fatburger, or Five Guys over Shake Shack.  I do think NY has it over the rest of the country in regards to pizza and bagels.

I always get the Shack Stack with crispy shallots! It's good with added bacon too! The fries are always delicious. I usually get the black and white shake and my boyfriend usually gets strawberry. Both are delicious too!   One of the things I have to applaud them for is their service. The workers are really nice and they don't hesitate to correct any errors, even though it's rare. There are workers going around checking on seated tables, which is great for a fast food place. And the wait for food has never been ridiculously long.  The only thing I don't like is how they give you a brand new cup when you get a refill. It's great for me and probably done for sanitary purposes, but it is wasteful. (Hence one less star)",

According to Japanese research waiting in line for food makes us think that the food tastes better. Perhaps this was the case because I remember waiting 30min in line in New York, but didn't wait at all in Vegas. However the fact that we had been pregaming before this Vegas Shake Shack visit and still found my Shake Stack burger underwhelming says something. The Shake Stack burger I had has a fried mushroom filled with melted cheese. I know, it sounds amazing, and it is, but the one I had here was not as good as the one I remember from New York. My friend ate a massive burger with loads of bacon and burger, but it was too much meat and too greasy for me to enjoy.",

They have different flavors of shakes and I can't get enough of their hard custards, which is practically ice cream. When I was there I tried their special shake for the week or month, the golden cake shake or something like that. It wasn't too sweet but still sweet enough tasting like cake batter. It was just the right finish to my burger and fries. I'm excited for them to open up their West Hollywood location!",

The burgers- kinda salty but very tasty and it's good with the crispy onions but I couldn't taste them too much and not much flavor overall good though. Fries- DELICIOUS!!! I would recommend just getting regular, it doesn't really need cheese but the cheese fries are good too. Shake/ custard/ concrete- not a fan of custard in general but good flavor and my family enjoyed it.",

The front is a bit small compared to the rest of the restaurant. It can feel very tight if there's a lot of people in line. There was only 6 of us and I felt it was tight, no room to move at all.   The lines were super quick, we ordered fries and a cheeseburger. They gave us buzzer and off we went to just go sit down. The buzzer system is way better than number calling, especially when it's busy and crowded.   The food comes on a silver tray. The condiments are on the side as per usual fast food places. I wasn't hungry so I only took a bit and I thought it just tasted like hamburger. The patty is super duper flat. So it does have a  char taste. I'm not a fan as this style tastes dry to me. The fries are fries. Who doesn't love fries?   They have custard ice cream, OOOHH YUM! Didn't try the custard but I heard it was okay.   Ok for now.",

We had been waiting to try this place since we went to NYC earlier in the year but unfortunately, the lines were always well out of the door. When we spotted this gem at the Las Vegas Outlets and on the strip, we knew we'd be making two different trips.   The first stop was at the outlets. We ordered the Smokeshack double and a regular single patty cheese burger with a highly suggested concrete. Now I've had many burgers, but this place I can only compare to other chain burger joints and I would definitely place this well above In-n-Out but right on par with Five Guys. The burgers were juicy and the flavor was ridiculous! We hit the Strip location the night before leaving town and relived the experience all over again. The only addition the second time around was a Chicken Shack burger which neither of us really cared for.   Stick with their all beef burgers and you simply can't go wrong at this place. No matter the location, you get the same good and fast service, and absolutely amazing food!!",

I ordered a \"double cheeseburger\" thinking it was the same as the \"Shack Burger\" which comes with lettuce, tomato, and some sauce. The employee never asked \"do you want anything on that?\"  I got the burger and it literally was just meat, cheese, and bun. That's really crappy. When the menu doesn't make it clear that the Shack Burger is a special burger they should at least ask if you want anything on it; at least in my mind it makes sense!!! I don't know anywhere else that just serves meat on a bun. I also ordered a strawberry shake that was delicious.",

    "text": "Oh, man. I've been waiting to try this place (yes, I know. I'm so late! Don't judge me, lol) and am so glad I finally did! This location is such in a prime spot on the strip, right on the corner, connected to New York New York. I ordered the Shackburger, pretty standard as I typically like to get the original of a restaurant's speciality for the first meal at that restaurant. I got the fries (which were crinkle!) and I HAD to get a shake...I mean it's SHAKE Shack. I had to! I chose the Mud Pie Shake, which was a seasonal flavor.   My first thought of my burger when I looked at it was 'wow, it's so mini'. To be honest, I expected it to be more sizable, especially for the price you pay. But I suppose it was the perfect size for me since I was able to pretty much finish that, all my fries, and also drink my shake.   The burger: The bread was so memorable. Perfect amount of sponginess and bounce. Not dry and airy. It was nice and dense. And moist. The bread is the first thing I think of when I think of the burger. The meat was fresh and tasted like an actual burger (well, duh lmao) but the meat tasted real. My burger came with lettuce, tomato, and Shacksauce, though I was a little sad to see that there were no onions. The hamburger comes with onions, though! But for some reason the other burgers do not. I'm assuming it's because all the other burgers come other ingredients like mushrooms, Shacksauce while the hamburger does not.  The fries: I am always so excited to see crinkle fries on the menu. But I can never find good crinkle fries. Maybe I just don't go to the right places, but the crinkle fries I usually have aren't very good- they're dry and too soft and often get soggy by the end of my meal. But the ones from Shakeshack were the complete opposite. Nice and crispy, firm, did not go soggy. Fave crinkle fries so far.  The milkshake: it was nice and thick, but not so thick to the point where my eyes would be bulging out because I could not suck it up the straw. It was  creamy and sweet and perfect with my meal.  Honestly, I've been craving another Shackburger ever since I left Vegas and am quite sad I'll have to wait until I visit SoCal or Vegas again. Until next time, Shake Shack :)",

The chain also has gluten free buns now, which is a huge plus for me!  If you're not familiar with gluten free bread, it's not tasty at all, but by the time you add other stuff with it, and eat them often, you forget about the taste honestly.  Just make sure to get the Shack Sauce with your burger.  It is appropriately located at the New York, New York hotel on the corner, since they ate a staple in New York.  Amazingly, there was no line and service was very quick considering the volume of customers there at the time.  If you're in Vegas and want something quick on the strip, this is the perfect go to.  Ride the roller coaster first and head to Shake Shack!",

They were both good, but were no Whataburger like we have back home in Texas, just good. We really like the lemonade they have, that's something a little different.

It was the closest place I had bookmarked near our hotel so it would only make sense to eat here as soon as we arrived.  I walked inside with my son while my husband and daughter looked for a table.  As you approach the line, an employee stood at the front of the line to coordinate the customers on which cashier to go to.  I waited no longer than 5 minutes before placing my order.  I ordered the Shack burger, chicken shack, 2 hot dogs, 3 orders of fries and 2 drinks.  After I paid, I was given our cups and a pager.  Then we went to fill up the cups with sodas and then we walked outside to look for my husband and my daughter.  Less than 10 minutes later, the pager buzzed and my husband went inside to grab our food.  in terms of flavor, my chicken shack was good but lacked seasoning.  The fries were crispy which we loved.  My kids said their hot dogs were good (they finished the whole thing) but my son thought that it looked weird since the hot dog was cut in half.  As for the Shack burger, my husband said it was good.  When we arrived, the inside seating was all taken but there was plenty outside.  I actually preferred outside seating because it didn't feel as stuffy and the view was outstanding.",

Even their price range is different, tsk tsk.  I'd tell you that I have been to Shake Shack in NY (2 different locations) and I have also tried it in Korea but no, I didnt get to try in Glendale, CA or Hollywood yet. I had no plans of coming to this location but my friend has not tried any SS in the past and she really just wanted to try it.  We both got the Shack Stack? burger, the one with the patty and the mushroom. It was so big but juicy and cheesy. I was eating the burger with the vanilla shake and their infamous cheese fries so burger was a little too heavy for me at some point. I dont normally eat any condiments or sauces but had to put on some hot sauce on my burger because without it, I probably wouldnt have finished my burger, haha. Even with the aid of hot sauce, I didnt get to finish the burger. Oops.  I had to go up to the register to ask something and the guy at the register was super funny and nice but the girl who took my order was just OK. She looked mad and stressed. She didnt really greet me or nothing, which is pretty unprofessional because she lacks customer service.   This location is pretty spacious and clean since its pretty new anyway. I wouldnt recommend to come to Shake Shack in general but if you really really want to try then just come and try it. I dont think you need to come here more than once honestly.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to come to Shake Shack for the longest time. This burger joint first started in New York in 2004, and spread to other East coast locations, and I was happy to find out they recently started opening on the West coast. Unfortunately, the only locations they have in California are all in SoCal. When they will open one in the Bay Area? I hope they open one in San Francisco someday. But as for right now, I will have to stop by when visiting LA. When looking for places to eat, I was ecstatic to see a Shake Shack on the Vegas Strip! It's near the NY NY hotel.  I came here around early lunch, and there was already a long line near the door, and tables were almost occupied. I ordered the Shackburger which is the standard cheeseburger, and as simple as it sounded, it was quite a delicious burger! This is not the typical burger you get from In N Out (sorry if you're a fan) but the burger had a thicker, juicier meat. I also tried their crinkle fries drizzled in cheese, and the regular kind. But for future visits, I'll stick to good ol' regular fries.  For dessert, I settled for the Shake Attack which is a chocolate custard ice cream with chocolate and cookie dough chunks. Which was a great, sweet treat, which was the perfect end to my meal.  Happen to have a burger craving and have a Shake Shack nearby? Don't hesitate to give it a try!",

They're very busy. The food takes a little longer than I would have liked to come out. Although, that might just be because my buzzer went off way before my food was actually done.   The selection of drinks both alcoholic and made in house is quite large. I didn't get to try any this time but I will next time for sure.   It's priced pretty decently for Vegas.

It's the strip so long lines and a wait are to be expected, but the service at this location is poor. After waiting to place your order, you're still looking at a decent wait to receive your food. I had to wait 30 minutes after I had ordered once just to get two shack burgers and a drink. I understand having to wait a little, but the food should be hot at the very least. More often than not the burger comes out cold and I've had to send it back.  The most recent time I went, which was earlier this week, I had to send my food back twice. The first time the patty was cold and the second time the bun was almost frozen.  They are pretty good about replacing your food quickly though.   Overall, the quality of the ingredients they use in their food is good, portions are small, price is on the high side, service is poor, burgers seem undercooked, and there are long waits to both place orders and receive food. It's just too much of an inconvenience and too big of a hassle for me to keep going here and I really wouldn't recommend this place until there is improvement in relation to some of the above-mentioned critiques.   I've heard that they're opening one up in Henderson later this year. I might give that a try and see how it goes.",

The patties were a good size, but they both agreed that the meat was a little on the dry side and both said that they couldn't taste the \"shack sauce.\"  Overall, it fell below our initial expectations.

What I ordered: ShackBurger, Fries, & Small Soda  ShackBurger: You know you see on TV and they take all day to make like the perfect burger. That's what I felt like when I took that first bite of the ShackBurger. The burger patty was cooked to perfection having the juices still intact. The thousand island or \"special sauce\" was little bit too much but hey it didn't get on me.  Fries: Crinkle-cut fries cooked to order and they weren't soggy fries like you get at a certain fast food chain that has the golden arches.   Small Soda: Well I wouldn't say small but it could represent as a medium.   Overall: Great food, wait time was relatively long but understandable when it's a busy day so it was worth the wait time.",

Located outside the NYNY Hotel- long lines but it moves quick so don't let that turn you away!  Ordered:  'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, & ShackSauce) - Basically the same as the Shack Burger just with a really well-cooked mushroom.  Shack Burger (cheeseburger topped w/ lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce) - Cooked perfectly and the ShackSauce tasted like mayo with sriracha.  Cheese Fries (fries topped w/ special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce) -Need to try these! Handspun Vanilla Shake (Malted)- This is where Shake Shack beats In N Out, I would say these are close to the best shakes I have ever tasted! Must-try.   Can't wait for the West Hollywood location in 2016!",

I liked the fries but my boyfriend didn't. I think I liked it coz it had cheese.   I'd be back for the shakes and root beer floats. And I'd want to try the other burgers as well!

Then, you order your food and seat yourself.  There is plenty of seating indoors and a few tables outdoors.  There are tvs inside as well.  The decor is nice and clean.  I really like the look of it.    Now, onto the food: Yes, they have bacon in some of their burgers, but I still think In & Out is way better.  Shake Shack's burgers are okay and they are smaller than In&Out.  Since I won some money from gambling, I offered to pay for my friends' food.  I was surprised to hear that the total for 4 people was close to $60.  In&Out still wins.. hands down!  Check this place out if you're in the area so you can say that you atleast tried it.",

Sadly, I wanted a shake of their custard of the week and they were out  Got the Smoke Shack burger, salted caramel shake, and fries.  Burger was pretty good. Plain, just meat, bacon, cheese, and peppers. I would have added lettuce tomatoes on it if I get it again. It was good - not $8 good, but good.  I hate crinkle cut fries but these were pretty good! Very crispy! Better than del taco fries by a mile! The shake was the best part. Delicious.  The atmosphere is really cool and nice, lots of seating. Food takes about 20min.  Similar experience to in n out where you just have to realize you're gonna wait awhile for your food.  Will I come back? Prob not, but I tried it.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  It seems very fitting that NY-originated Shake Shack has come to Vegas and settled in New York New York. You can see the bright glittering sign and storefront right off of Las Vegas Blvd. You queue up outside, go through switchbacks inside, order, get a pager to know when your order is ready, and find your own seat either indoors or outdoors. I had the original when I was in NY, so I was eager for the bf to try it.  I got the same burger as last time -- a single size ShackBurger, which is just a cheeseburger, for $5.19. Bf tried ordering the hamburger, double size, but I think the server misheard and instead put down a double ShackBurger with bacon, which was $7.99 + $1.55 (for the bacon add-on). Due to the long line and the crowds of people, we didn't bother adjusting the order.  Food came in a reasonable amount of time. We scooped a booth table (score!) and waited probably 10ish minutes. Bf digged the food, especially the potato bun, which is apparently an East Coast thing. Bacon was nice and crisp, so we didn't feel completely gypped by the almost $2 cost for the add-on that we didn't really want. The burgers, however, were on the small size and the price was high for the size you receive. Our order of fries ($2.95) came hot and very crisp--love it! We also ordered the jackpot concrete. The description sounded good (vanilla custard, Belgian waffles, strawberry puree, marshmallow sauce, and rainbow sprinkles), but the presentation not so much. Not worth the $5. I'd say, stick with a shake.  Shack Shake is a nice addition to the list of Vegas eateries. It fits perfectly at New York New York. A quality, but pricy burger.",

    "text": "This review I actually give them 3.5/5 shake shack I believe is pretty overhyped. I would say if you are just coming in for a casual regular burger and fries the overall price for the meal is overpriced and quality is not up to par with the price tag that comes along. However if you come for the shroom burger and their shakes, which is a lot pricer than your usual burger then yeah shake shack would get 4/5 stars but other than that, this is not something I'd come back for. We ordered bacon cheese fries, a hamburger, and a double shack. Total came out to be around 21$.    Bacon cheese fries: 4/5 this was pretty good for the taste of it. Your average crinkle cut fries and creamy cheese sauce similar to nachoooo cheese without the pepper taste. For the price tho and the amount they give you, it's overall eh.   Hamburger 3.5/5: nothing special about this. It came out to almost 5$ for just a regular patty and burger. The meat was juicy though and the bread soft and chewy.   Double shack 4/5: with the cheese and the double meat, this burger was quiteeeee juicy. I think this is a good comparison to in-n-outs double double but overall in-n-out wins with price and quality. Can't beat that.   To sum up, shake shack is good, not spectacular. Is it overpriced? Yes for sure. Is it something I'd eat often like in-n-out? No lol. Come here if you are in the mood for a shroom burger or something that's worth your money but other than that a reg burger here isn't worth the price, I'd just stick to in-n-out.",

I ordered a coffee flavored shake and hubby got cookies and cream shake. After a 10 minute wait we finally got our shakes, hubby's shake was very thick and mine was very runny like melted ice cream. I showed the other cashier (who was polite) my shake and she agreed it was not made properly. She tossed it in the garbage can and ordered me another one this time I too ordered the cookies and cream shake and again after a long wait I finally got my shake and thankfully it was made properly.

Service was fast and I was ordered their regular shack cheese burger, and their cheese fries with bacon.   It came out to about 14 USD with a soft drink, not sure if the prices are on par with other shake snacks not on the strip.   Food came out in about five minutes and looked like the picture (unlike another chain starting with M).   The burger was on the smaller side, but fresh and not greasy. The pickles were crisp, and the vegetables fresh.   The fries were definitely decadent and delicious. The cheese is more of a processed nacho cheese. But hey I wasn't complaining.  Didn't get a chance to order a shake, because well I just thought that'd be a bit too much...next time I would just order plain fries or split the cheese fries.   Also, I did notice they had a veggie burger but that was mixed with cheese-so if you're vegan or dairy free. Probably not your best option.",

While I love their burgers, even the secret menu one with bacon and peanut sauce, my absolute favorite is the shroom burger.  OMG, that cheese pouring out when you bite into that giant breaded portabello mushroom is heaven!  The fries are choice and their concrets are great to finish your decadent meal.    Then I feel guilty because I'm an In-N-Out fan at home.  But wait, Shake Shack is expanding to the SF Bay Area?!?  Oh it's on!    Fast food burger wars in SF are about to get interesting!  Stay tuned!",

Three burgers and fries a float and lemonade. I received a text that our order was ready.  Because of the logistics of MGM to New York New York it took a good 15 to get there. We arrived and found ten to 15 were ordering , waiting for orders EVERY ONE got their order before me the two Postmates the three who ordered with the cashier. If not for an employee that took it upon herself to pull our order and bag and tag for us.  At least one employee knew good customer service. Please I hope this doesn't happen to someone else.  Please fix either the mobile system or your employees or both. Needless to say we were disappointed.",

These are great tasting, quality burgers cooked and served with some of the best customer service in town (they are in the service elite). Make sure you get some fries. They are good, though not my absolute favorite.    Quality milkshakes and concretes are not to be missed. The basic offerings are great and you can keep adding to the mike to kick it up several notches.   They made a mistake on part of our order (missed one of the orders from our big group). They made the missed order right away and did not charge us for the forgotten meal. All done with a smile and the quickest fix you have ever seen.   So if a Shake Shack is in your path, or even requires a little detour it is worth it. Come and don't let the quick moving lines scare you at all. Grab your burger, fries, drink and enjoy a tasty meal with a couple of hundred of other believers.",

It is not at all what I remembered and it made me very happy. I had it twice before at other locations and didn't stand out as anything special (when you have an in-n-out burger you know its in-n-out). This visit to the Vegas location has me backtracking and I look forward to future visits. The chicken sandwich and fries were tasty too.   I do think that location matters where you try it so if next time I try it and it doesn't do it like Vegas, then I will spend another meal here next time I'm in town.",

It reminds me of Costco bulk hamburgers.   However, I would say the strawberry shake is better than in-n-out. Shake shack strawberry shake was not overly sweet like in-n-out.

We were expecting a long line, but it went by quickly. However, it was packed.. it was hard to find seating for our group of 4 but people came in and out so we were able to find seats in a big communal table. We got the shack dog (hot dog with cheese and fried onion) shack stack (cheeseburger with a fried portabello mushroom), and cheese fries. All of them were as good as I remember from NY, especially the cheese fries. After eating all that we went to the free photo booth in the middle of the restaurant and took some pictures.  Before I end this review, you may ask me, me being a Socal native: In N Out or Shake Shack? Shake Shack is pretty good.. but In N Out all the way for me. Thanks!",

FYI - the mushroom is fried and that in combination with the cheeseburger and shack sauce was amazing. The burger was really good, but the fried mushroom was the best part.

Compared to In & Out, this is pretty good, not as good as a double-double animal style IMO, but pretty good and it fulfilled my burger craving. I also had the crinkle cut fries which are meh. Peanut butter shake for dessert was well worth it! Real peanuts blended into the shake!  I know there's one that opened near home in LA.

We went to eat there, as soon as got off the plane, and checked into the hotel. We were staying at the NYNY, so we didn't have to travel far.  I got the single ShackBurger and the Double Jackpot Concrete. Their burgers are 100% all-natural Angus beef, with no hormones, and no antibiotics. What sets this burger apart from the rest, like most burgers, is the sauce. The ShackSauce is like a tangy Thousand Island dressing. It tasted really good on the burger. My favorite item from this meal was the Jackpot Concrete. It's a frozen vanilla custard blended with strawberry puree, marshmallow sauce, and rainbow sprinkles. What I loved about it is the crispy funnel cake pieces that I tasted in there.   My hubby doesn't eat red meat, so the only entree he could get was the Chicken Dog. He said it wasn't bad, but wished they had more options that he could choose from. They only offer Crinkle Cut fries, which was fine. I'd prefer shoestring.  I really like how they arranged the seating area. There are TV's throughout the restaurant. They also have their humongous TV screen that's great for catching games. Outside seating is available, if you want to eat right on the strip.",

I got the shroom burger which was a crispy fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese. Yummy! They have more than burgers, they have hot dogs too.   Pros: vegetarian options! they serve beer and wine. location is great. crinkle cut fries are classic and bomb! they also have frozen custard.

    "text": "Gimme dat Shake Shack!! Their burger was heaven, pure heaven. I loved that it wasn't too intense. It was a perfect greasy spoon burger that didn't make you feel like a greasy spoon. The chicken sandwich wasn't bad either, but the burger is where it's at. I would also highly recommend getting a root beer and some custard.   I have to give it to the Shake Shack owners because they really nailed it with their Las Vegas outpost. Of course it had to be in NY/NY, but the fact that it's outside adjacent to a park that looks like NY made it that much better. I loved it. There were even pigeons. I would like to think they flew them in so you really get that feeling of being in NY, but I can't say for sure. I can't even say at all, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it.",

    "text": "Finally, I ate at Shake Shack so I can now conclude that In N Out is better.     Overall Shake Shack is a much fancier restaurant...almost Umami Burger level but not quite. The servers are friendly  (but so are In N Out servers)  and the restaurant is nice and clean.  The vibe is much more hip/urban than the old school diner-ish vibe of In N Out.  The burgers cost quite literally twice as much as their In N Out equivalents.  Which puts them in a bad category of 10-15 dollar fast food burger meals.   This is the category where the meal costs more than you want and never tastes quite good enough to match the price tag.   I always end up wishing I just spent less for slightly crappier food OR more for an actual sitdown restaurant burger meal.     They have crinkle cut fries which are actually too dry inside...i much prefer the crinkle fries they serve at the random mom and pop Mexican joints in LA.   I got the shake stack which is the shroom burger + regular burger in one.   It's good don't get me wrong...but not ~9 dollars good.  The biggest problem is the tiny burger patty....i have this pet peeve against burgers having a crappy bun size to burger size ratio.   The bun is way too big for the patty in this case.    They also serve a multitude of shakes, beers, hot chocolate and other drinks.   I got the coffee shake which was not bad but once again it's tiny.   The shake comes in a McDonald's child size cup.      They have two fountain drink sizes...regular and large, so i'm thinking ok the regular is like a medium size at McDs (or any other fast food place really).   Nope the regular size is the same size as the shake, which is to say it's like a Happy Meal sized drink.   Sure it's unlimited refills but it's pain when you have to ask for a refill after every 2 gulps.   AND they don't take your cup and refill it,  they throw your cup away and give you a whole new one!  After 2 refills the destruction to mother nature was too great and I stopped getting refills.  Well played Shake Shack, well played.  In conclusion,  even if the burgers cost the same at Shake Shack and In N Out i would still order the In N Out burger because it's just more satisfying.",

    "text": "There is definitely a hype about this place, probably since their locations on the west coast tend to be few and far between.  I've eaten here and at one of their NYC locations and I must say they have a pretty good burger and fries, but it just doesn't live up to the hype for me.  I will take my west coast In N'Out burger over this one!    One big gripe for me about this place is the pricing.  A hamburger is $4.55 and a Shack burger (seems like the only difference is a slice of cheese?) is $5.55.  A very expensive upgrade, if you ask me!  Definitely good to try if you've never had Shake Shack before, but I'll take a pass for a cheaper fast food burger.",

Even though we came late afternoon (around 3-4pm) but the line is still out the door (as expected ;) )  The line moved quickly though, boyfriend ordered a Double Smoke shack (Double patties, smoked Bacon, ans roasted peppers , would be nice if they put lettuce & tomatoes)and I got the single Shackburger (would love some pickles on mine but didn't see the option) and we got 2 orders of fries. (Its crinkle cut fries and IT is AMAZing!!!!)  Coming from Bayarea we have In & Out burger to compare to. But have to say Shake shack is right up there with In & Out! Would definitely come back when in Vegas !",

I've seen Shake Shack pictures everywhere for YEARS and always wondered what it tasted like, so my boyfriend and I were thrilled when we saw they were building one in Vegas. We ran over here on our first night for dinner - we were so excited.   The line raps around to the door, but it moved pretty fast. It also gives you enough time to decide on what you want since the menu is pretty large. I decided on the shake stack and he got the smoke shack. We shared an order of fries.   Shake stack: cheese stuffed deep fried mushroom stacked on top of a burger patty with lettuce, tomato, and shack sauce. I added white onions. Be very careful when eating this because the cheese is ridiculously hot and will ooze out! The mushroom was pretty salty and the patty was smaller than expected. I liked the texture of the bun but wished it was toasted (like at in n out). Not really sure what their sauce is - didn't have much flavor. Animal spread is better, just sayinnnn.   Smoke shack: cheese burger with bacon. Pretty standard and self explanatory.   The fries are crinkle cut, so they were nice and crispy.   Their sodas are not self serve, so you have to ask for a refill, which is kinda a hassle - especially since they're busy.   Overall, the food was decent but I think my expectations were too high. Their prices are also too high for how little food you get! Come on now, this IS fast food, but you're paying restaurant price. Smh! We were still hungry after this and went to Secret Pizza hahah.  Now that I've experienced it I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return. I'd say go if you've never had it and want to see what the hype is, but you'll probably be disappointed.   Sticking to in n out! West coast is the best coast!",

I hail from the land of dairy and cheese, so I love the creamy and density of the apple pie custard.   I like this location as it's situationed toward the end of the south strip, near the Park, and seating is usually available indoors or out where you may people watch or look at the street glitter at night. Lunch or in the afternoon is simply way too packed and lines are too long for my patience.   For a fast food joint, it's quite on the pricey side. We ordered a burger to share. I wasn't hungry but wanted a bite or two of burger just so I can write a review. Husband order a burger with bacon, no fries, and a drink. When our order came, I was disappointed. The burger was smallish. For $6-7, I was expecting more.  That \"more\" came from the flavor of the bun. The meat, bacon, tomato, and lettuce is just like all other burger joints but the herby bun is what stood out. It was delicious and greasy. Not worth going through the long line for another other priced burger but definitely worth a try.",

There have been times where I've eaten the Shack Stack burger and the cheese wasn't melted thoroughly inside the portobello mushroom. I've forgiven them for those times because the food there is still legit. This is one of the places people hype up but I think their quality stands True to their ratings.   I highly recommend to get the following: -Shack Stack (a cheeseburger that includes a crisp-fried portobello mushroom with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses) -Cheese fries (crinkle cut fries topped with melted cheese) -Rootbeer   Many people compare Shake Shack to In N Out. While I've tried both, I think each of them have their pluses (Shake Shack has a solid Shack Stack burger with actual crispy crinkle cut fries and In N Out has their customizable burgers/fries with their signature sauce). Try out Shake Shack if you're able to!",

We gave it another try and I was happy we did.  I got the Shack Stack burger: the melted cheese-stuffed Portobello patty and cheeseburger combined. It was heavenly. I took one bite and the hot melted cheese poured out. The fresh lettuce and tomato was great and the bun just right and not stale. Everything was fresh and well-made. Husband got a Coke to drink and the Smoke Stack: burger with bacon, cheese and cherry peppers. It was a vast improvement compared to last time. We shared an order of Cheese Fries and I got a side of their Shack sauce which is a bit like a horseradish mustard.   Dessert: I got a single concrete mixer - the Jackpot. It had vanilla frozen custard with strawberry sauce mixed with Belgian waffle pieces and rainbow sprinkles. This was extremely good! We paid $29 for all of this..not bad by Vegas standards!  Recently, they opened a Shake Shack inside the Mall of America in my home state. I'm going to be visiting that location soon! Once I've recovered from my Vegas haze and replenished my resources.",

I have been dying to try Shake Shack since my fiance visited Las Vegas without me a few months ago, and was so glad to finally squeeze in some time to stop here on our recent visit.  I ordered the Shack Stack, which is a combination of their vegan burger (stuffed portobello mushroom) on top of their signature patty.  Don't judge me....it was my first experience so I wanted to GO BIG!  My boo insisted on ordering their cheese fries and you know I don't argue when it comes to cheese. *heart eye emoji*  For a busy night on the strip, we didn't wait TOO long.  Our burgers were ready in about 5-10 minutes.  I mean, they have a whole army behind the counter cooking!  The portobello mushroom was fried nicely and had a great crispy outer layer, while still remaining moist inside.  The cheese filled center was absolutely delicious!  Crinkle cut fries are my favorite.  Cover it with a creamy cheese sauce and I am a happy girl!  Finally, their house made shandy was the perfect touch for enjoying our burgers in the hot Las Vegas heat!    The prices are kind of high, but for a restaurant on the strip it's reasonable.  Don't plan to share - portion sizes are just enough.",

They use sweet buns for their burger, which taste pretty good compared to regular burger buns. We ordered the following items: - burger - add in the shack stack sauce, good for kids - hot chick'n - highly recommend it - chickn shack - crispy chicken with house sauce - loaded fries - top with cheese and bacon  - shack burger - not a bad choice - cheese burger with bacon - shack cago dog - strawberry, chocolate and vanilla shakes - if you like sweet drink then this is for you Reason I gave it 4 stars due to the attitude I received when we told the employee that they messed up with our order.

I had the regular cheeseburger and the patty was moist and firm, the bun held together well which is surprising because it was so soft! Reminded me of a hawaiian dinner roll. The fries were crispy as well, some people are put off by the crinkle cut because it is reminiscent of cafeteria food but it is still yummy and holds sauce better. Wish they had ranch or bbq sauce though (:",

I saw a lot of pics and already knew I wanted the shack stack. With cheese fries.   The shack stack was a burger with a huge fried mushroom stuffed w cheese that oozes out after the first bite. It was really good. The cheesefries was good too. The cheese wasn't overwhelming, nor was it underwhelming.   I like that they have ketchup and mustard easily dispensable. They have mayo too but you don't need it.  For dessert I had the concrete w cookie dough. I tried the toffee and thought the toffee mix was a lot better.",

In SoCal it's known to be the \"In-n-Out of New York.\" I didn't know what to expect and also tried to make sure I didn't have extra high expectations. Took my first bite and LOVED IT!!!!  It's definitely not as cheap as In-n-Out, but the burger is a lot JUICER and the bun is a lot SOFTER. The only downfall is that they don't have onions in their burgers. However, I was quite surprised that the burger can STILL be delicious even without the onions!!  SHACKBURGER DOUBLE: Cheeseburger stacked with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce - I'm all about the double-double at In-n-Out, so I chose to eat the double here as well. DELICIOUS! Super juicy and just plain good. If it's your first time, I'd recommend to always start with the original - Shackburger (single or double - however way you like it; add a bacon if you'd like).  SHACK STACK: Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses) topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. - ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Cheese-stuffed mushrooms?! What more can I ask for!!!  FRIES: Crinkle cut fries - I wasn't too happy to find out the fries were crinkle cut. Crinkle cut fries reminds me of high school cafeteria fries.... BUT ITS NOT! The fries were very crispy and delicious. We ordered one regular fries and one Cheese Fries. They were both great.",

So naturally I shy away from the cheeseburgers and ordered the burgers.  I got the double-double and when the cashier told me, no cheese eh? I told her that I just couldn't have diary products.  So she printed me a receipt with all the diary products and what I could and could not order. This is one of the only \"fast food\" chains that I have ever seen give me an allergy list, and they also sent back an allergy listing to the back so they were careful with the preparation of my burger. I had the sauce on the side which contains mayo, which contains some lactose, but it was fine in small dosage.   The burger was quite juicy and it was really delicious. Together with a double double hamburger and a large drink, my total came out to be around $11, which is pricey for fast food.   The strawberry mint lemonade was too sweet and I recommend you water it down with soda water or something of the sort. But overall I had a great experience here.",

We stopped by around 4, and the line took less than 3 min. I ordered a cheese burger, crinkle fries, and a vanilla frozen custard. Everything was top notch! The burger was so good... Every ingredient had a role and they all played their role perfectly. The fries were crispy, not soggy at all. The custard was creamy and thick and oh so satisfying in the Vegas heat.   My only little minor gripe is the service. It's my first time at a Shake Shack (hopefully not my last!), so I didn't know the lingo and I studied the menu a little bit harder than maybe others. But the cashier was talking really fast and was annoyed at me. Whatever, I guess that service at a fast food joint.",

The wait was short (we went around 1pm on a Tuesday) and the workers were all friendly and cheerful. The burgers: Amazing!! The shakes: Ridiculous!!!  I loooove these burgers. I got the Smoke Shack burger. It's so moist and the bun is perfectly toasted, but still soft on the inside. The patty tastes homemade and it's nowhere close to being described as \"dry\"--and the bacon was on-point.  And the shake...I'm a TOTAL shake person and this frozen custard shake is hands down my FAVORITE. It was so good, I was wishing they had larger sizes instead of just the one size. I was even tempted to go back the next morning and get another shake, that's how good it is! Sadly, my shuttle to the airport arrived before Shake Shack opened at 11am.  All in all, this place is amazing and I will totally be back every single time I go to Vegas from here on out!!",

On a previous trip I had tried their Shack Burger and that I thought was rather a let down.   This time around I came in starving and went straight for the double SmokeShack and fries. The SmokeShack comes with smoked bacon, cheese, two patties, and shack sauce.   While the burger was good, I feel it could benefit from some lettuce, tomatoes and pickles to cut the richness of all that cheese and protein. I confirmed that their but remains lackluster in my honest opinion. The buns would make the burger better if it were toasted.   The fries were also just ok. They seem like your ordinary crinkle cut fries (similar to Del Taco's) and didn't leave me feeling they were spectacular. While they are good, I would say they are just average.   If you've never tried definitely give Shake Shack a try. See how it compares to your favorite burger for yourself.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not sure if my review of Shake Shack is entirely representative of typical dining experience here, because we came for a light dinner after conquering the legendary Bacchanal brunch buffet. As such, we had limited appetites and disproportionately soaring expectations. (Vegas first world problems.)  1) The CHEESEBURGER is satisfying though not gourmet. There's nothing fancy like bleu cheese and caramelized onions, but it's a carefully tuned version of the classic cheeseburger with cheddar/lettuce/tomatoes. Compared to In-N-Out, Shake Shack stands out with the thicker, juicy patty and the soft, brioche like bun. The SHROOM BURGER is quite good with panko fried portobello, though the mushroom patty is thinner than I'd like.  2) I really liked the CRINKLE CUT FRIES. I may be biased, growing up with a crinkle cut mold in my play dough cooking set and having this ingrained in my mind as the paradigm French fry. Nonetheless, it's something about the texture that somehow makes it extra delicious--my theory is that the shape increases the surface area to volume ratio to augment crispiness. I think I prefer the original to the CHEESE BACON FRIES, which had a savory flair of bacon and bell pepper; unfortunately it gets somewhat soggy and takes away from the crinkle-cut-ness texture.  3) The FROZEN CUSTARD was the highlight, velvety smooth, rich and decadent, with a full-bodied vanilla flavor. It tasted like quintessential vanilla ice cream, except with a creamier consistency somewhat like the intermediate between non-melted and melted ice cream.   All in all, the visit was a 3-star experience: satisfactory but not mind-blowing. The portions seemed small for the price (like gourmet burger small). It does seem that Shake Shack is a bit over-hyped, which may have contributed to our slight disappointment. My advice would be to go to Shake Shack with a mindset that it's almost similar to In-N-Out--the food is good here, but it's not the place for your grandiose Vegas-level expectations.",

The tables were really nice as well as the table used to be part of a Brooklyn bowling alley.   Ordered the SmokeShack burger with a Shackmeister dog and a beer float. The burger was phenomenal. The cherry peppers added both flavor and heat without overpowering the burger. The pickles was crisp and tasty. My favorite part was that all these ingredients didn't make the burger all sloppy. There's a lot of places where you would order a burger with peppers, pickles, lettuce, and sauce, and it turns into mush but this burger held up.   The hot dog was great as well. Definitely a very cheesy dog and the shallots gave it a nice crunch. The beer float at first didn't seem too appealing. Don't know what beer they used, it's something pretty dark. Reminds me of the Devastator double Bock but can't be certain. It's a bit much but when the vanilla custard melts and combines with the beer, the tastes compliment each other. I can get used to drinking beer through a straw if it's got that vanilla custard in it.   Another great touch is that they had calories on the menu. I love when restaurants let you know how many calories you are getting. It didn't stop me from getting all the deliciousness but it's easier to log into myfitnesspal and cry later.   Place is definitely a place to stop in and eat. It costs a little more than regular fast food but it's worth it.",

I'm not sure what type of bun it is but its heavenly. Ugh. Drooling thinking about it. The fries are crinkle cut and crispy and crunchy on the outside and perfectly potato-y on the inside. Some burger places have bland fries. But not shake shack. Their fries are ON POINT. also the vanilla shake was delicious. Very creamy and nom. Ok yeah I went way overboard ordering this much food but like everything was amazing so its ok right? #treatyoself   Prices are pretty high for a burger place. I wouldn't call it fast food. More like a hipster gourmet burger place. Higher up than in n out but less than a sit down/waiter service restaurant...if that makes sense. Anyways, come here and get a burger. And fries.

This had so much hype in my mind be cause I love mushroom burgers but this didn't really appeal to me as much, the cheese filling on the mushroom might have been a little overwhelming.   I ordered the cheese fries and didn't enjoy them that much. I guess the cheese just wasn't really what I was looking for. Higher quality cheese than your average cheese fries but the texture and flavors weren't my favorite.   The strawberry shake I got was one of the most basic shakes they have, but it's was super amazing! Great shake, (they better do it right cause it's in their name!) not overly sweet and texture was on point with little pieces of fruit.   Great spot!!! A lot of seating available and very modern design make this place a cool place to eat, just not really into the burger I got or the cheese fries.",

We ordered a ShackBurger, Cheese Fries, ShackMeister Dog, Jackpot Concrete, Draught Root Beer and Peanut Butter Shake.  Burger and fries were our favorite, root beer the least, just nothing special.  Our total for all that was a little under $30.  Prices are a little high for quick service but not to bad.  You can definitely tell you are getting better quality than your typical fast food.",

Ordered the double cheeseburger with no lettuce and tomato. Well seasoned, juicy, meaty flavors. The buns were perfect, soft, fluffy, almost spongy. I love crinkle fries- don't know what's up with all the hate. These were better than In n Out fries. Thick, hot, crispy. Burger wise, I love them both. I live 5 mins from In n Out. But if Ss was just as close I'd visit both of them the same equal amount.   Thank you to the manager type dude who said my vanilla custard was on the house. It really made my day. Custard is soft and velvety and creamy. I really enjoyed my experience!",

I didn't go in with any sort of expectation however, I've heard nothing but praise about Shake Shack.   I ordered a single Shackburger, fries, and a drink, which cost me almost $12. I have food allergies so I asked what was in their Shacksauce and was told that it was a \"secret\". What's funny about the whole thing, aside from them saying their recipe was a \"secret,\" is that there is clearly a sign on their registers that says to ask anyone on the staff about their ingredients, especially if you have food allergies. A quick Google search will give you the ingredients, so no need to ask ;)  The burger itself was good but overall, I just wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. Their Shacksauce is good, but it didn't really add any necessary flavor to the burger. The fries were good but again nothing new. For the cost, might as well take a cab to In-n-Out just behind the Strip.  This location is appropriately inside New York New York and easily accessible from the Strip. We came on a Friday night and it was pretty packed. Despite my disappointment with the burger, I liked the space and that there was ample seating.  If you're into trying burger chains, I'd give Shake Shack a whirl but otherwise pass!",

    "text": "It's almost as good as New York.  Crinkle Cuts and Concretes!  I was craving some comfort food after my team took a narrow loss and their season ended so I headed to Shake Shack. I asked a bunch of people for  directions and nobody noted that the entrance was outside of the casino, but now, you'll know and not suffer the same misery of walking in circles for 15 minutes.  Once we arrived i saw a medium size line, nothing compared to a normal Madison Square Park line though so I could handle it. I also noted that they have a \"C-Line\" for non hot food. It differs from the \"B-Line\" at the original in that you can et Shakes.   Once i ordered the food was on a similar level to what I'm used to at MSP location. The only weakness was the burger which tasted just a little bit off, but I couldn't figure out exactly why. Even one day later I still can't seem to figure out what was off with the burger. I only finished 3/4 of it before I moved on to the Crinkle Cut fries, which  are just as good as I recall, and happen to be my favorite thing about Shake Shack.  Finally I went on to my Shake Attack. It's my go to concrete and it was spot on. I had the chocolate hazelnut (custard special of the week) subbed in for the normal chocolate custard and it was delicious.  Now for the bad. It is Vegas priced and it seems like it is more than it is in New York. Secondly the staff, though friendly, just don't seem to have the same order taking efficiency as they do in New York. Maybe it's not their fault since most people going to this location aren't regulars, but it was definitely noticeable.  Will I be back? Yes, next time I'm in Vegas I'll stop by for a concrete or crinkle cut fries.   Is it still worth it to go to the original Madison Square Park location in Flatiron? Yes, because nothing beats Shake Shack in the park.",

    "text": "This place is extremely popular among the tourists as well as the locals so the lines can sometimes be out the door and down on the strip.  Theres a good reasons for the lines though.  = )    Our first try at about 2 pm on a Sunday made us turn around and go to Fatburger. The lines where crazy.  We decided to give it another try on a weekday and where there about 20 minutes before they even opened.  The manager came an opened up about 10 minutes early when he saw that there where people waiting.  Thats what i call customer service!  In comparison we had to wait 20 min pass opening time last winter while we wanted to try Berlins Berlin Burger International. Quite a difference in customer service there so applause to Shake Shack.    As this was our first visit after hearing all the rave reviews we did not want to go crazy but sticking to what made them famous. The burgers of course.  Had the double shackburger with pickles and cheese.    All burgers here looks amazing and picture perfect. Biting in to it i noticed that it was very juicy even though they cook the burgers well done (i prefer medium rare if the meat is good). The lettuce was crazy crisp and the tomato ripe. The Shack sauce is a 1000 island similar sauce and not that far from In n out's sauce.  The best thing about the burger was the amazing cheese that had melted and felt almost like a creamy cheese sauce.  One of the best burger cheeses ive had.    What brings the burger down for me was the bread that i think is too thin and doesnt make the rest of the burger justice.  Still a solid great burger without any crazy stuff too it.    The ambiance and layout of the restaurant is nice and the location on the middle of the strip outside NY NY is hard to beat.    I would say that the burgers are a 4 star for me, the value is a 3.5 as its a bit more expensive then In N out while i would hold the latter a tad higher also in taste.    The manager opening up 10 min  early bumps the place up though so without him i would have given Shake Shack a 4 star rating.  So enjoy your 5 star rating and give the manager a raise!",

Shake shack gives many options for burger and hotdog lovers. The fries were perfectly fluffy and crisp something that can be butchered too often with the crinkle variation. People tend to compare this place to In-N-Out but to me they are on opposite ends of the spectrum. At first glance i found this place to be quite pricey but the quality of food soften that blow. Everything my party got lived up to its menu description. We will be making this a vegas go to for sure!",

    "text": "Delicious. Great for a snack or lunch. Line can get long I'm assuming because they have a line marked off that extends to outside, but I've never waited more than 5 minutes to order. Waiting for the food you ordered will take at least another 10 mins though. The buns in my opinion are what make the burgers so tasty. Cheese fries are with a liquid nacho like sauce. I'm into it, but if you like shredded melted cheese then it may not be for you. Super easy access from Monte Carlo even though it's location is part of nyny hotel on the strip.",

    "text": "This was on my Vegas bucketlist for quite sometime and I finally got to try it ! It was so good that my friends and I came back the next day and order food from here again haha. The location of this place is great ! We stayed at the Cosmo and the walk from there was probably about only 10 minutes. When we arrived there was no line and a lot of extra seats left (assuming everyone's going out to eat somewhere else or getting ready to hit the club) The first day we went I ordered their Shakeshack burger with their famous fries. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Its such a simple meal but forreal tho the burger was outstandingly amazing. Better than the average In-n-out everyone keeps saying is mouth watering every single time. I love their fries though their like a crinkle cut style that still is crispy yet soft on the inside. The Sunday we went to Shake Shack was actually REALLY BUSY. Like so busy there was a line outside and it was about 113 degrees out. Even with the fans blowing mist in your face I was sweating out alot. But dont fret ! The line goes by super quick and staff is always friendly and of service. This time I ordered the Shake Stack Shroom burger with crinkle cut fries and a peach lemonade. A little pricey....but hey, ITS VEGAS PEOPLE. but the shroom burger was worth it ! Its literally a burger with a mushroom/cheesy filling with lettuce and tomato. Pretty filling because I couldn't finish it all. Since it was so busy, the seating situation was a little different than that Friday afternoon. (Probably because it was around 12pm for lunch time)  and we had a group of 9 but luckily there was 2 tables that got up next to each other so we were able to seat somewhat near each other. And i mentioned earlier that the employees here are nice and at service. I say this again because one of my friends accidentally dropped his tray of food all over the ground and literally nothing was saved from that and he brought the tray back and the employees replaced all his food free of charge and gave him an extra burger as well on top of what he ordered (THERYE SO KIND!) so A+++ for shake shack employees, 5 stars for the food and ambiance as well ! Can't wait to come back to Vegas and eat here again !",

No, it reminded me of steak n shack or Freddy's so pretty similar burgers already in the market. As far as preference In n out is a better value for $$$, paid $20 for two burgers and ONE Fry. I'll walk across the street to in n out or ketchup in miracle mile shops to get a burger fix while in Vegas.",

Still a much easier experience than the West Hollywood place I'm stuck going to now since I live in California.  I'm a big fan of Shake Shack in general, and I wrote a more thorough review about the Hollywood location so I won't go in depth again. However when I was there they had the ShackMeister burger, which was similar to a regular ShackBurger except they had crispy, delicious fried shallots as a topping. It was so freaking good, it's a shame they don't offer that burger anymore (I don't currently see it on their online menu). Their crinkle cut fries are also excellent, and the layout of the restaurant is open, large and looks great.  Also great service. When I asked for a business card, the manager said they didn't have any but went to the back and gave us some free coupons instead! It was a great keepsake and a classy move from the management.  All in all, had a great experience here and it was definitely an awesome location for a first timer!",

The biggest thing that got to me was the size of the burger. Tiny as hell for the price. It didn't even have anything on it when it came out. Just 2 buns and the meat. I had to ask for the insides lol It's a flipping burger that stuff should automatically come on it if I'm spending more than $4. The fries and the shake was the best part. Crispy fries and a very bold chocolate taste. Needs to be thicker however. But seriously corporate needs to not skimp on the size of the burgers. Dissapointing! In-N-Out has bigger burgers and that's saying something!!",

I have to say the cheese fries were a little disappointing since the cheese basically was nacho cheese out of the can. BUT the chicken burger was very crispy and very moist at the same time. How do they do that?! I usually really like chick-fil-a crispy chicken sandwiches, but the chicken sandwich from here does not even compare. The buttermilk herb sauce was flavorful but not overwhelming, and everything tasted very fresh. I also got he lemonade expecting it to be fancy or something, but it just tasted like fountain lemonade and was not really worth it. I would come here again, and would just hope that the line is shorter !",

    "text": "ARGH I wanted to hate Shake Shack. To me it was an imposter from NY who just over-complicated the already perfect burger with high prices that couldn't hold a candle to In n Out. Though I am loyal to In n Out, I have to admit there are times I would admit I want Shake Shack instead.  The lines are crazy in the Vegas one so time wisely. Hubs and I got lucky and went on a Monday before lunch time and waited maybe 15 minutes while the line was still inside. I got the Shake stack because I wanted to give this a proper chance, also I love meat and mushrooms. Hubs got the Shack burger with a hot dog (maybe Shackago don't remember). We also got the crinkle cut fries. The food was piping hot, fresh and surprisingly good. The Shake Stack was almost suspiciously flavorful and delicious and I wondered how, hubs' burger was good too, just pretty basic and this is where a standard burger would lose out to in n out. The crinkle cut fries I had super low expectations because not once in my life have I ever had properly cooked crispy crinkle cuts. These were good though, what fries should be, hot, cooked through, crispy AF on the outside and soft on the inside. The hotdog was not memorable. I don't think the prices are justifiable especially considering their small portion sizes but whatever, imagine you're in NY and you're paying extra for the privilege.  Though this place is pretty big, there's very limited seating for the # of people going through, so don't plan on sitting down here to eat. Some of their seating is annoying, my hubs and I luckily acquired some seats and we were sitting on benches with little knee height round \"tables\" to balance our food on. It's annoying because we're stooping and bending over to eat the food, also gives me indigestion to eat like that.   This place is located at NYNY hotel and it's pretty obvious from the street. Lines get absolutely ridiculously fucken crazy so watch out. Prices are too high for me to feel like it's a GREAT value but overall, I sometimes crave the shake stack still.",

The fries, the hamburger meat, the cheese, the frozen custard shake are made of quality ingredients and deserve recognition. Price point is higher for that very reason. I'm so addicted to the perfect fries! Cheese lovers can order a side of cheese dip to keep the fries crisp. The shackburger left me wanting more. The shroomburger and the chicken sandwich are also amazing!",

The toppings were all fresh, and the meat was incredibly juicy and just covered in cheese. It's like a East Coast version of the West Coast In-N-Out Burger.  The fries were crinkle cut, and fresh. I'd never had fresh crinkle cut, it's always been frozen for me. Yummy. Had their Vanilla shake, which was creamy and delicious. I was amazed to see that they do offer the regular shake flavors, as well as one weird, monthly flavor. This month's flavor was blueberry custard. I wasn't feeling that adventurous at the time...  There was hardly a wait to get served, and the food didn't take long at all to arrive. The place was clean and well lit. I enjoyed the fact that you could post a selfie from their photo booth and email it to all your jealous friends!   This burger place is attached to the NY, NY Casino, since it is a Manhattan burger establishment and all.",

They have 4 or 5 cash registers which really speeds the process up.  As for the food, we enjoyed the SmokeShack burger and the cheese fried were amazing.  The malt shake was just okay, almost like a soft serve ice cream shake.  We like a more texturized milk shake like at McDonald's.  Service was great, plenty of seating, and don't be afraid of the long line because it moves fast.",

I hate how dirty the dining area was during our latest visit. Granted the patrons are pigs for not busing their own tables. However, I shouldn't have to clean down tables & chairs before sitting down. Suggestion to management: put more garbage bins around the dining area...and spring for large straws for your large drinks. We can't drink your large drinks without a bigger straw. :( -----------  Previously a 5 star review..... Take something that everybody loves (hamburger & shakes) and step it up a notch...that's what Shake Shake is all about.   Located on the Las Vegas strip, just a 2 min walk from NYNY Hotel. The hamburger meat tasted fresh and wholesome. The shakes tasted like they were made from fresh ice cream (they weren't slimy like most burger places).   Friendly service, big screen TVs, Clean Tables, Clean Floors....and even Clean Bathrooms. ;) This store seems to be well managed.",

The line was quick since I did the c express line which is basically only for drinks.   I asked the cashier what the best milkshake was and she said the black and white. The price was a bit high at 5+ dollars especially for the size of the cup but I honestly loved my shake.   The consistency was so thick and creamy and the flavor combo was so good. It had a fudgy chocolate taste mixed wit the vanilla that I enjoyed.   Overall a great experience for me! Hopefully I'll get a chance to try their burgers in the new location in LA!",

I ordered their Smoke Stack Burger which had peppers, applewood smoked bacon, and cheese and also added pickles bc I live for pickles. My boyfriend ordered their classic double cheeseburger and we shared a side of cheese fries and a chocolate malt.   I loved my burger and it solidly deserves 5 stars. The bun is fluffy and flavorful the meat is juicy without being too fatty or drippy, and the toppings really enhanced the burger without being too much. I thought the cheese fries were solid also, but probably come closer to a 4/5, mainly because there could have definitely been more cheese.   As far as comparison goes, I like it better than some of the fancier burger chains, especially when you factor in the price, but once you do factor in price In-n-Out is still my first choice if I want a meal under $10.",

I ordered fries & the Shackburger - their original cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce, which was much pricier than a cheeseburger at In-N-Out ($5.19 vs. $2.55). The Shackburger is satisfying and definitely worth a try if you're looking for a hyped up burger joint from the East Coast. However, there was nothing spectacular about it. Don't get me wrong, the burger was tasty, but quite plain. On the other hand, the crinkle cut fries reminded me of the frozen ones you could purchase at a grocery store.   In conclusion, Shake Shack makes a tasty burger with minimal ingredients; I would definitely be interested in coming back to try their other burgers and shakes. BUT I still like In-N-Out way better!",

Hubby also got crinkle cut fries along with a hot dog and apple juice for our daughter. I took a bite of my burger, and first thing that hits me is the flavor of the meat. So flavorful. Perfect size similar to in and out. The crinkle cut fries were crunchy and good. The mango lemonade is a little tart but good. There were lots of seating inside. They give you a buzzer to pick up your order. You basically get your napkins, straws, ketchup at the tables.   There is a waitress that picks up your trash when you are done, and asks how the food is. She was really nice. Great customer service here. There was music playing in the background. Television screens are all around the restaurant. I definitely would come back here for burgers if I stayed on the strip!",

    "text": "I could never go to Vegas or any East Coast city without going to Shake Shack. Period.  The first time I ever went, I knew it would be trendy and I had some expectations. The first thing that caught my eye was the branding. Their branding is everything, and 3 years ago something like that really does set a business apart from the rest. To me, it shows they are passionate and care enough to have their business be different yet up to date. Their brand is cohesive and I can tell just by looking at it that is Shake Shack.  I ordered a Smoke Shack because bacon, fries, and a plain chocolate shake. I don't normally order anything dairy since I can't have it, but I was feeling rebellious. The sauce is amazing, the toppings are perfect, the bun is only cut 3/4 of the way so the stuff inside doesn't fall out as easily, the burger is an actual beef patty which I am picky about, and the fries were the perfect balance of fried but baked and not overly greasy. I didnt eat more than a few bites of the Shake, but it was also amazing.   Since that visit, I have had pretty much their entire menu except for the hot dogs, and I am nothing but impressed. I can order anything and know I am getting something delicious. The first time I had their chicken sandwich it rocked my world. I know will switch off between the burger and the chicken sandwich since I can't pick a favorite.   I wish I had more to contribute as far as shakes go, but I've heard to always go with the concrete shakes since they have the best consistency. I also know that each location has their own specialty Shake.   Bottom line, you are a fool if you don't make a trip if you have one close in your travels.",

I was hoping to try the original in NYC first but we won't be on the East Coast for a while so yeah...  I completely forgot the specific burgers we ate but we enjoyed them and their crinkle fries were yummy as well. I personally like a good ole fashion burger and fries place...I don't need any gimmicks or fad. I also like that it doesn't have crazy prices like other places on the strip.   Ok, that's all I can remember so I will just attach some photos below :)",

    "text": "I've had shake shack in many different locations all over the US and even other countries, and this one killed it. In a bad way. They ruined my fav burger chain for me. After I placed my order they gave me a buzzer. It buzzed about 30 minutes after I ordered my food. I went to the counter (where there was a crowd of at least 20 people waiting already) to get my food. Waited 20 more minutes bc apparently all the orders were mixed up and not in sequence. Many people got their food before me, who ordered after I did. I finally had to ask an employee to check where my food was. She finally brought it out and I was missing half of my order. 5 minutes later got my order and ate it ice cold. I get that it's Vegas and there's gonna be a crowd, but at least keep the food warm if you're gonna make people wait for an hour. If I'm gonna pay $8.50 for a burger it better be piping hot and amazing. I've never had this problem at any shake shack except this one. If it's your first time trying shake shack, pls don't ruin your experience at this location. You don't know what you'll be missing!",

I went around lunch time on a Saturday. There was a line of course but it moved SO FAST. They must have so many people working.   I ordered the Chicken Shack for the first time and it was truly life changing. I was talking about it the rest of the day. The herbed mayo and pickles really made the flavor of the chicken stand out.   The cheese fries and custard were as good as ever.  Our party of 8 was also able to find two booths to sit in, so that just shows there is plenty of seating.   I'm so anxious to try the Shake Shack in LA!",

    "text": "My dad is always on the look out for cheap, fast-food burgers.  I'm always on the lookout for amazing food.  Combine those two directives, and one is prone to end up at Shake Shack on the Strip sooner or later while in The City of Sin.  Unbeknownst to me ahead of time, Shake Shack is evidently the \"In N Out of the East\", or so they say.  Probably a good thing they didn't have that bar set for them ahead of my visit, as In N Out holds a VERY special place in my heart (likely literally as much as figuratively).    We showed up on a mild Friday night to a line about 15 deep, and it moved pretty quick.  The food menu is quite a bit more broad than In N Out (or at least not as secretive?), and there are a LOT of beverages and ice-creamy desserts on offer.    I grabbed a Smoke Shack burger and a Coffee Fair Shake.  The burger was very, very good.  It is very close to being on-par with In N Out's offering.  There was awesome flavor coming from the burger as a whole, but I definitely want to call out the bacon on this one - it was distinct and flavorful, and really added a smoky layer of punch to the sandwich.  The shake was tasty as well.  Props go out for the different, funky shake flavors!  My brother-in-law was gracious enough to offer me one or two (okay, maybe a handful) of his cheese fries, which combine American and cheddar cheeses, and are as addictive as advertised.  At least that's the excuse I provided my brother-in-law for my heavy-handed  \"share\" of fries...  I'm willing to say that the East Coast definitely has a hit on its hands with this joint.  So much so that I'm glad one isn't in my hometown, as I could see myself visiting here WAAAAAY too often!",

Their burgers are really juicy and the patties have good texture.  The buns are a little sweet and overall, you can't go wrong. It's definitely a must try if you haven't had Shake Shack before.",

I came during dinner and although it was packed, they serve rather quickly and there is plenty of room to sit.  I ordered the bacon burger, bacon cheese fries, and the black and white shake...because it is shake shack and i need to try the shake.  The burger was a little disappointing to me. It cost about $6 and it was kinda small with no lettuce or tomato. It was patty, cheese, bacon, and shack sauce. It was good, but it didn't taste gourmet. It was closer to a mcdonalds burger.  The fries were awesome! They were crispy and the cheese and bacon made it even better! These were better than the In-n-Out fries.  The shake was pretty good. I can see why they call themselves shake shack. It had the right amount of thickness so it wasn't a struggle sucking it out.  Overall I thought this was worth a try. It is definitely uncommon here since its a East coast chain, so try it if you're in Vegas.",

Just something about their cheese fries that make it so good. Though the lines can be long, it usually goes by pretty quick as well as waiting for your order. Nice spacious place with plenty of TVs around. They also have an outside sitting area in case you want to breathe the Vegas air or because there's really no seats available inside.  Besides the cheese fries, their burgers filled with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese makes it a great combination with the juicy meat. The juicy burgers make Shake Shack a great option for a quick bite if you're craving a nice hamburger. Of course, their many options of shakes provides a great add-on to the burger and fries. I've only had their peanut butter shake. It's a bit sweet, but can't really complain of how great the taste is. Wasn't too thick like other places which makes it harder to enjoy. Overall, great option and spacious place.",

    "text": "After finding out that New York's Shake Shack rivals with California's In-N-Out, I knew I had to try it! How can any burger joint rival with California's MIGHTY In-N-Out?!?!?! Just how?!?! That's impossible, I thought.   But HOLY CRAP, after the first bite into my Shake Shack's burger, I got confused and I felt like I CHEATED on my beloved In-N-Out because I must confess that I like my meat to show a  little pink.   Unlike In-N-Out, Shake Shack's patties are a little pinkish and a little rare and that makes the patty taste juicer and therefore more delicious tasting!   The only downside to the Shake Shack burger is the price, it definitely cost more than In-N-Out but I'll pay more for better quality meat.  So far, I've tried their Shake Burger with double meat, Smoke Shack Burger with double meat, Shake-cago Dog and their crinkle cheese fries and I love their burgers the best! The pink meat in the burger makes a HUGE difference! The fries complimented the burgers really well.    Ohhhh yeah!! I'll definitely make a stop at Shake Shack when I'm in New York or Las Vegas again!",

We went with my parents during off peak hours, so the line was pretty short and moving. My parents have been to Shake Shack many times and are familiar with the menu. My hubby and I had the double ShackBurger - cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Hubby had the crinkle cut fries while I had the cheese fries - crinkle cut fries topped with special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. I had the black & white shake - vanilla & chocolate. Next time I want to try the caramel or coffee fair shake or their frozen custard. Our daughter had the single Shackburger, crinkle cut fries and caramel shake. I like Shake Shack better than In & Out because the burgers are thicker and the buns are soft and sweet. Shake Shack serves 100% all-natural Angus beef burgers with no hormones and no antibiotics, veggie burgers, 'shroom burgers, hot dogs, fries, frozen custard, drinks, beer and wine and even doggie treats for your dog. Shake Shake will always be on my list when I visit Vegas!",

It seemed to be popular (possibly because it's new or could be convenience or could be because they have great burgers) because there was a line to the door every time we walked by. Prices were better then a full service restaurant.  If your only looking for a sweet fix you can hit the walk up window for some delicious custard. Burgers were a bit greasy but tasty. Definitely will stop back in on our next trip to Vegas!",

The burger itself was outstanding, the bun was soft and just the right size, special sauce was, well, special!

    "text": "I finally got a chance to check out this place after all the hype I've been hearing.   Located outside on the Strip at New York New York, Shake Shack is the latest addition to the already saturated 'upscale burger' scene here in Vegas. Upon walking in you are greeted by a massive menu board where you make your selection, order at the window, and pick up your food shortly thereafter. The restaurant has open seating so good luck finding a spot to grub. There is no server/waiter, but they got the orders our fast and turned tables quickly. Now don't let the ordering and seating situation fool you, the price and quality here is pretty much the same as an burger restaurant on the Strip. A burger, fries, and drink/shake will run you anywhere from $15-20.   During my visit I tried the Smokeshack, fries and their homemade lemonade. I was surprised at the tangy flavor from the cherry peppers and the quality of the ingredients. The crinkle cut fries were thick and fresh, much better than what you get at White Castle or Cane's.  They have the option of smothering them with cheese and I recommend it! The lemonade was pretty standard but they got free refills so no issue there.   The restaurant itself is pretty nice; as would be expected for any recent addition to the Strip. The interior has a sleek modern look to it; featuring a small lounge area where you can wait for your to-go order and sizeable dining area if you are eating in. There is plenty of outdoor patio seats available and its only gonna get better when New York New York opens its 'Central Park' area right next to SS. Overall its nice to see a place live up to the hype and worth checking out.",

The restaurant is located at the NYNY hotel on the strip, so you'd have to park at the hotel parking structure or just walk from wherever you are on the strip. The restaurant decor was cool; it reminded me of a retro but modern feel and I liked the idea of using wood materials found in New York (check table pic). The line moved quickly and my friends and I got our food fast. I ordered a shackburger and regular fries for a complete meal, and it came out to around $7.    Shackburger: a simple burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese and shack sauce (tasted like it was mustard based); it was pretty small but it had a good flavor. I could tell they also buttered their buns because there was an extra fat component to it.  Fries: the fries were crispy and crinkle cut, and they were good simple fries, but nothing special.   For the price I'm paying and the size of the food, I'd have to say it wasn't really worth it. I'll stick to going to In N Out where I can get a really good sized burger for a little over $2; now those are prices you can't beat.",

    "text": "Located at the New York-New York, Shake Shack is yet another east coast staple bringing more burgers to the Las Vegas strip. The restaurant itself is actually just outside of the hotel, and is currently (may never be, I don't know) not accessible from inside. It's a pretty good size space, and has a ton of seating, from booths to tables, and even some weird, but cool lounge style areas. They've also got their own restroom inside, which is a nice touch. It could just be me, but having to walk out of a restaurant and look for a bathroom somewhere else in the casino is annoying.  Now, when you first walk up the steps and inside, you'll see a big menu board right where the line forms. On more then one occasion during our visit, the line was almost out the door. So, if you're able to find one, I'd look for a paper menu to view while waiting. On that menu, they not only have burgers, but also a few hot dogs and dessert options like milkshakes and concretes. They've also got a decent selection of drinks including draft root beer, several beers choices, wine and even Stumptown Cold Brew. Sadly, it's just bottled and price almost $1 higher then anywhere else.  I ended up ordering a previously limited special burger that they've now but all turned into something that will always be available, according to the cashier at least. It's called the ShackMeister and comes topped with beer marinated shallots, cheese and their own ShackSauce. For whatever reason, they only allow burgers to be cooked either medium or rare, and even those choices aren't listed anywhere. Even so, the meat was decent and seasoned well. I'd highly recommend getting at least a double though, as the patties are only 4oz. My burger had a good amount of cheese on top, and the crispy shallots added a nice texture. They also use potato buns, which I thought was a kind of soggy, but good and still had a little chew to it. The ShackSauce however, was all but impossible to taste.   We also ordered some cheese fries and milkshakes. The fries aren't anything spectacular on the own, but they're nice and crispy, and the cheese blend they use to top them is actually really good. My malted Coffee Fair shake was pretty tasty and had a nice strong coffee flavor, but it was pretty thin for being malted, and not sure it was worth $6 for how small it was.   Speaking of prices...I expected them to be up there, but not this high. All the items on the menu are a la carte style and my burger alone was $9. Our order of 2 burgers, 1 fry, 1 drink and 3 milkshakes was $44 and some change. With everything we ate tasting very similar to something like In-N-Out or even Steak 'n Shake, it prevents me from giving them anything other than a 3 star rating.  Their service however, is well deserving of 5 stars. Our party of 10 and then 2 others who showed up laters were constantly checked on by more then one employee. Because they don't have an actual soda fountain, the employees have to go around checking to see if you need a refill. We were there eating and chatting for well over an hour, and never had empty drinks.   For visitors, I can certainly see why it'll be popular and do extremely well. It's a decent burger, the shakes are quite good and the service is excellent. But for locals, past trying it for the first time, I can't see many going out of their way for something that's similar to what you can get for half the price from places easier to get to all over town. With that being said, I'd still eat here again, I just won't be rushing back.",

I first tasted their burgers in NYC a few years ago and have since been hooked. I make it a priority to stop by on every NYC trip. Since I moved to Vegas this summer, I have been looking forward to the grand opening of this Shake Shack at New York New York for months. I can't believe now that it's here, I can have Shake Shack whenever I want without having to fly across the country.   My go-to burger here is the Shack Stack. I've been burned on more than one occasion by the fried portobello mushroom filled with molten-lava cheese. They now warn you at the register of its tongue-scorching potential. The fries are better than your average fries. Unlike most burger chains, their crinkle-cut fries come out crispy and don't have that greasy feeling. I wash all that down with a cup of root beer, straight from the tap.  This new location right outside New York New York has a very contemporary feel. I love that there's no long wait and it's a lot more spacious than any of the NYC locations. I will definitely be back on a regular basis. Keep an eye out for their ever-changing weekly frozen custard flavors.",

It took a while to get the food.  Seating was available.  I got annoyed when I picked up my food.  The buzzer went off and I went to the pick up area.  The girl had the food on the side and was busy flirting with some guy and completely ignored me and the next customer who's food was ready.  The food was good and the place remarkably clean for how busy it is.",

I'm always torn as to whether it is better than In-N-Out and I just recently heard that the quality of beef is much better at Shake Shack which definitely makes my decision easier.  We will definitely be having it again.",

As well chicken sandwich gets Rave reviews... Naturally had to get the special treat for my 4 legged fur family....cheese fries with order... Ok i like different cheese... Very trendy type atmosphere.. Only one complaint i ordered a double smoke stack. Got a double burger instead with a single smoke... I will call that my fault as the order was repeated to me... Way better than the name brand up the street.   See my Wahlburger review... Better price better food but alas it is on the strip and i choose not to be on the strip as a local that often.....locals may want to try Summerlin as of course the strip would be a parking nightmare... I valet at NY NY....",

    "text": "Yum! I made sure to try out Shake Shack in LV, since I missed out in NYC (where its originally from). So the lines here are always incredibly long, but the process was pretty quick. Didn't have to wait for too long. Nice and open space with many windows and proper seating. Their were many young people here just chowin down on some fancy fast food grub. I opted for the mushroom burger (its a fried mushroom burger with cheese). Felt like eating vegetarian, as its the option I primarily try to choose when dining out. Ordered some fries and the chocolate concrete as well. The food was decent, mushroom burger was a bit on the small side. It was a bit difficult to eat as the mushroom became rubbery and chewing after getting fried. French fries were okay. The chocolate concrete with the chocolate sprinkles was probably the best thing I ate. It was creamy and luscious. Their were a few brownie bits sprinkled in, but definitely not enough. Overall, my experience at Shake Shack was okay, not too bad. I'll definitely try something new off the menu if and when I visit. Supposedly they'll be bringing a location to Houston, TX. Until then!",

    "text": "Sorry guys, but this place was not good. Like legit sucked. I'll keep it short. Here's why.  We get there on a Tuesday night so it wasn't that bad of a wait. Ordered our food...2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 Tenaya Creek hefs...$40. Ok fine, it's in a casino. Jacked up prices are expected. We get our food and right when I unwrapped my burger, it's already an oily mess. Seriously?!? I JUST unwrapped it and it's already gross. Bun is soggy, oil is dripping everywhere...just a big disappointment. I get to the middle of my burger patties and its raw. Like straight red. I had to break the raw pieces off so I wouldn't get sick. I ordered bacon in my burger but didn't get to enjoy the crispness of it because it got soft from all the grease of the patties. When I got towards the end of my burger, it was falling apart and there was a big puddle of oil where my napkins were. I was just so upset that I couldn't even finish it and just threw it back on the tray. I was actually pissed off that my bf had paid $40 for this crap. I haven't been angry over a meal in such a long time. The only saving grace and the reason this place gets 2 stars was the delicious crispy fries and beer.   I definitely won't be back and I'd much rather have In-N-Out to this nonsense. What a waste of a cheat day.",

    "text": "what to order: shack double burger and cheese fries tip: ASK FOR ONIONS!! I love onions and they don't ask so I wasn't aware it was an option.  FINALLY! I got to try the infamous East coast version of In n Out... It was really good, very tasty and surprisingly filling but In n Out has my heart. I also really liked their modern decor and decorating! Very nice.  Shake Shack has a much bigger menu and I would love to try their other items but I went for the simple double party cheeseburger. We also got the cheese fries and regular fries.  The cheese fries were good. My boyfriend said it was too cheesy for his taste but \"too cheesy\" doesn't exist in my world.  The double patty burger looks small but it's quite filling. I love onions in my burger and decided to ask if they had any about half way through, and surprisingly they do! They just don't ask if you would like in your burger (like In n Out does)   Basically, it's like fancy fast food. Shake Shack is good, but I can't eat it too often like I can with In n Out.",

M life members can actually order through an expedited line which is awesome however I didn't need to whip out my Platinum card this visit lol it wasn't that serious..My order of choice was the double smoke shack burger! I waited approximately 7-10 minutes for my burger to go! I will have to return to try out more of the sweet side such as the shakes and ice creams but other than that I'm just kind of like meh.. it's a burger place.. what's next? I personally have another great Burger place of choice but before I completely rule out coming back to shake shack I have to try maybe another burger..",

I came here for the first time (June/EDC week 2015) line was pretty long considering this is one of Vegas's busiest time of year since everyone visiting is attending the huge music festival. But on the bright side, the wait goes by pretty quick.  I tried the smoke house burger , cheese fries, and regular fries the first time. Everything was sooooo good! The quality of the patty, vegetables, and cheese tastes fresh. And the fries were golden crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. They serve crinkle cut fries, btw. Which kinds of sets them aside from other burger joints.   Everything was so good that I had to stop by again before heading back home to Seattle! Craving it as I'm writing this review, I hope one opens up in Washington sometime soon!",

The fries left me wanting more since I didn't need a napkin to wipe off excess grease or oil. The frozen custard was a happy ending to a wonderful meal. The texture was smooth and creamy.

I had a basic hamburger with bacon, cheese fries, and a soda and I wasn't disappointed. The food came out pipping hot and was full of flavor. It was well priced for the food I purchased which is a rarity on the Vegas strip. The place was packed while we were there, but the numerous employees I encountered were super friendly and didn't let the volume of people phase them. If you're looking for something fast, fun, and fulfilling while on the Strip I recommend Shake Shack.",

Located right outside of NYNY is this hip restaurant with ample indoor and outdoor seating. Around lunch time, it gets pretty crowded but the lines move pretty quickly. They have a decent selection of alcohol, burgers, shakes, and fries. We ended up getting:  Shack Stack- $9- Basically it combines the beef patty burger with the portobello patty which oozes with cheese inside of it. This was amazing, even though the burger looked small, the flavors blended so well in your mouth. Just delightful.  Cheese fries- $5- How did they get the fries to be so crunchy? It was an aromatic mash of cheese and potatoes. It was like a cheesy potato fiesta in my mouth.  The meal came out to $30 for the both of us so it's a little bit pricier than I hoped. However, it was worth it because that blend of beef and mushroom is just amazing. I was worried to try this place because I had a nasty experience at white castle but this place is 10 times better.",

Each serves a different purpose - one being fast casual dining and the other being fast food.  So with the shake shack at the NY NY we ate there twice this trip and loved both visits. The service is great, quick and reliable. And the food of course is amazing! I am a stickler to the shack burger and enjoyed that both visits. My husband tried the slap shot burger on one of the visits and enjoyed that. It was different with fried pickles. The first visit we got regular fries and the second visit we went with the double down fries, which is my favorite. Something about the mix of the cheese sauce, the peppers and bacon makes it amazing. We also enjoyed a shake and a creamsicle float, which were both delicious.  I really can't say enough. If you're in Vegas and looking for a casual meal, hit this spot up. We haven't tried their other locations yet, but I'm sure they're just as great.",

If it's not too hot or cold I recommend sitting outside where you can enjoy the water wall and other outside amenities. Parking is quite a walk because you have to park at the structure.

That buttery bun-top slips delightfully down your esophagus. One bonus star. If only it had lasted for more than one bite.

The bad:  The milkshakes are not blended well enough that you can't really suck through a straw. The fries are not impressive and feels like they came from a frozen bag.   Overall: I would come back again and again. 4/5 because the fries and milkshake were subpar.",

Super easy to spot this place if you are driving or walking on the strip. Parking is definitely an issue, but that seems to be the situation for any place on the strip. Super huge on the inside, definitely can fit a large amount of people. It is always packed, so i suggest you make sure you have time to spend if you want to eat here. Place is clean for a fast food joint, but can definitely be cleaner.   SERVICE: The service here was average. I am guessing because of the large demand on the workers. Way too many people inside so it creates a lot of pressure on the staff, very understandable. But i still would like to be treated in a more hospitable way, especially that this is a tourist site to a lot of people.   FOOD: This really carried the restaurant. I was amazed by how good the burgers were here. i tried both the Shack burger and the chicken sandwich. Both amazing buns, super soft and yummy. The meat was great, very juicy and flavorful. Fries were also amazing and fresh. Cannot complain about anything i ate here, SO GOOD!   Average per person: $15-$20 depending how much food you order.  FIRE!  See you soon!!!",

That amazed me considering the time they were working and how tired they may had been.  I decided to order a single ShackBurger with fries to share with my party. The order took rather long before I was called to pick it up, but that's okay. The softness of the potato buns were very attracting to me. It provided a different texture to the burger that isn't typically seen. Similar to the bun, the burger simply melted in my mouth. The vegetables were very fresh and the meat had that delicious quality meat taste. The overall burger wasn't too greasy or oily like your typical burgers you see. I, however, didn't find the sauce extremely unique. Other than the patty itself and the buns, it tasted like another hamburger. I would not classify the burger any less delicious though because I would certainly order this burger again.  I wanted to try Shake Shack for the longest time, ever since the debate between InNOut vs. Shake Shack (West vs. East). My cousin reminded me though that the two shouldn't be compared. If you're feeling one or another, then just go accordingly. I though my experience was quite pleasant. I enjoyed the ambiance of this store. It looked like a nice hangout place be it after school, after the club, or if you're looking for a midnight snack. Definitely give it a try if you're ever around.",

Our double smoke burger and chicken sando was hot and delicious. Plus the glass of white wine and peach cobbler ala-mode - fantastic..!!!   Onto the review: I must mention I was hesitant to dine at Shack Shack especially with so many eateries on the Vegas strip, since my experiences at various Shake Shack throughout Los Angeles has been overall subpar (not as great as it used to be for the past few years.)  But after today experience at Shake Shack Vegas per my added review below, I will definitely give our LA based Shake Shack another try.   Let's talk Hospitality: Upon entering we received a warm welcomed, the order counter and food service counter team was super friendly and displayed great team work.  A big shot out to Cameron the floor hostess. She was so awesome by quickly assisting me to my table as she saw me fumbling with my luggage, drinks and condemnations in hand...   I also noticed the GM - Kenny Dean, greeted and assisted various customers at their table.. When he visited our table we briefly spoke about the founder of Shake Shack and the company vision. I must say Kenny and his crew today surely did live up to the hospitality standards and then some. They say a great manager/management makes an overall great team!   Now that's hospitality - making even the simplest meal stand out even more so. Especially these days when most eateries and even fine dining doesn't seem to live up to the hospitality it used to be.  Thank you Shake Shack Las Vegas crew for the excellent customer service and delicious meal.",

    "text": "All this debate between In-N-Out and Shake Shack, I had to give Shake Shack another shot in Vegas since I tried it once in New York. Final verdict: I still love In-N-Out better because of their buns and that I can add grilled onions.  I was able to try bites of the regular cheeseburger, their chicken sandwich, their mushroom burger and their fries.   Shack burger ($5.89): It was a normal cheeseburger. It wasn't amazing and their shack sauce isn't memorable but you can't really go wrong with a cheeseburger.  Chick'n Shack ($6.99): This one might have been my favorite out of all the burgers I tried here. It's a fried chicken sandwich but it was tastier and stood out a bit more to me than the rest  Shack Stack ($10.49): I almost ordered the Shroom burger by mistake but good thing my friend told me to make sure I order the correct one! The Shroom Burger does not come with the cheeseburger patty. If you're like me and can't give up meat, this is the one to order. If you only want the crispy portobello mushroom burger, the Shroom Burger is the one you wanna order. Overall, it was good but it wasn't amazing to make me crave coming here.  Double Down Fries ($8.99): The location we were at didn't have a description of these fries so we thought they just came with cheese and was a larger portion of fries. We wanted this to share but we later realized it came with so many toppings! It's crinkle cut fries topped with shack cheese sauce, spicy cherry peppers (not spicy), and bacon. It was ok but I would stick to the normal fries.",

Mmm... it's been way too long since I've had my Shake Shack fix so was very happy to find one in New York New York, where seating was plentiful (well, at least we scored a booth and didn't have to wait on a Saturday afternoon, which is more than I can say for two times we've gone to Shake Shack in NYC). The line was long, but moved quickly and food was divine. I always get one Shackburger and then wish I had ordered a double or a second burger. But then an hour or so goes by and I am SO glad that I didn't overindulge and have two burgers. One is plenty. Do you hear me, future self? One is plenty!!  The Vegas location has lots of seating indoors and outside, big TVs playing in various corners and a party atmosphere. Plus in a city where prices can be so jacked up, this is one spot where you can still get a reasonably priced meal!",

The cheese itself tasted great and the fries were super crispy! The chicken sandwich was deliciously crispy!! If you ordered the spicy version, it's not as crispy but the level of spice is definitely spicy! The shack burger was delicious but small. And the loaded fries were well worth the price.

    "text": "Despite now being a world-renowned burger joint, Shake Shack actually started out a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park, as part of an art installation!  With a glowing sign going up the side of New York New York, you absolutely cannot miss this Shake Shack when you're driving down the strip. From the moment I saw it while getting a lift to the hotel, my mouth was watering at the idea of getting my hands on one of those famed burgers! And although I had to wait a couple of days to get in there, it was totally worth it.  From the moment you step through the doors, you feel like you're not just getting a fast food burger, but that you're getting the Shake Shack experience. That's probably just me being extra, but it was pretty cool in there! It was the culmination of me having to suffer hearing about how delicious Shake Shack was for years and years, while being stuck all the way out in Hawai'i. But I can definitely say, it was worth the wait!  Food-wise, we got a regular ShackBurger, a Peanut Butter & Bacon Burger, cheese fries, and lemonade! And oh man, I ain't lyin' when I say that every bit of that meal was so good. Again, I'm probably being a little bit extra about this, but I really did enjoy everything we had. The burgers were amazing, the fries were cheesy and good, and the lemonade was perfect for a hot summer day! As Joyce W. put it, \"Burgers so juicy, you need a life jacket!\" If I were to make one note, though, I'd urge everyone to make sure that they use the pickles they get with their peanut butter & bacon burger. They really make all the difference in balancing out the flavors.  But overall, the place was clean, service was good, and food was even better! Absolutely make time to hit up Shake Shack if you're in the area. For me, it's always good.",

The person that was taking our order looked like he wasn't happy with life. Since it's our first time we had a few question about the food, but he kept shoving the menu to us. I mean, I guess okay... but is that how you want to be treated ? Say no more, I've ordered the bacon cheese burger and the portion just doesn't compromise with the cost. Since it is on the strip it's a little pricier than the shake shack outside of the strip. The food is decent and small portion. This is more of a quick snack then a meal. The shake is delicious! I would definitely go back for that vanilla  shake.",

    "text": "It has been a while since I had last been to any Shake Shack.  Even when I went to the east coast last spring, I didn't really have any time to visit one.  So with my last trip to Vegas, I decided to stop by the NYNY location for a late dinner.  I definitely came hungry this time and ordered two sandwiches!  The Chick'n Shack since I had yet to try it, and my favorite Shack Stack.  Because I ordered two sandwiches, I refrained from ordering cheese fries.  Chick'n Shack and Shack Stack -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vM0yzc&s=caf973549fbe8f67014d855fd6759036ca75b1ff182cbe0d5f7abcb4bb6e49e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vM0yzc</a> The Chick'n Shack is basically Shake Shack's answer to Chick fil-A with a crispy fried chicken breast filet, lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk herb mayo.  It's pretty damn tasty!  The chicken filet was huge, crispy, juicy, and full of flavor.  I would definitely order this again!  As for the Shack Stack, there's really not much else for me to say other than it's still delicious especially with that fried cheese stuffed portobello inside.  It's still my go-to burger there!  NYNY's Shake Shack is still an awesome location and it's gotten even better now that The Park is open.  The last time I was here, The Park was still under construction so the part of the patio area was closed off.  So it was nice to finally the whole area outside Shake Shack opened up.  It makes for a great people-watching spot while enjoying burgers and shakes.",

    "text": "This was my initial time eating at one of the Shake Shack locations. I have had their fare at Citi/Field and was always impressed by their food.  The Vegas location is strategically located at The New York- New York Hotel with outside access to the T-Mobile Arena.   As a result the venue has plenty of seating and is well appointed. I arrived there shortly after the lunch hour rush and had our choice of seating. We ordered the Shake Shake Burger and the \" Shake/ Argo Dog.   We took our seat as we waited for our order and noticed that for the most part none of the tables had been wiped down and there was no one available to do so. As a result we had to improvise and use a few lens wipes to clean the table.   We picked up our food and were disappointed on a number of fronts.  Now I love dogs, Hound Dogs, Lapdogs, even Hot Diggity Dogs. What I don't love is a cold dog.   Unfortunately, The Shake Shack Hot Dog was luke warm, which is never good for a food item that by definition should be \"Hot\".  Also the celery salt was not put on the dog but on the toppings, which resulted in a Salty Dog. As I consider myself a Hot Dog aficionado, this was not a good experience.   The Burger was also lacking. I realize that salting a burger prior to grilling is a must, however they took it to a ludicrous level. The burger was so salty that it was difficult to eat.   I'm not sure I will return to this location as it was not up to the standards of my Citi-Field experience.  I gave a three star review based upon my Positive Experience at the ballpark.",

Little did I know driving by in my home town I was passing up on some good food.   I'm not a burger person or into shakes but they offer much more. Today I had a chicken sandwich minus the mayo and crinkled fries. Yum! Yum! The creative concept of a modern day restaurant makes this a happening place. The hip feel, music, and tv's is an added touch. The restaurant is printed  on the wall along with the registers. Many items to choose from that have been creatively mastered to all taste buds. Kids meals included. Fresh lemon dates, draught root beer, sodas and beer to wash the tasty food down.   The service was great. Friendly staff that help make your fast food experience a nice one. Did not have to wait long. I was given a buzzer to use while I sat and waited. Condiments on point. The right ones for the food they offer.",

    "text": "Stayed at a nearby MGM resort and didn't get a chance to come here last time. Well, fortunately for me, I made it a priority to pay a visit here a few days ago.  If you are near Park Plaza or NYNY, this would be the place that would have the longest line hands down. However, it moves pretty quick and it's one of those places you order and you'll receive a buzzard while waiting.   You'll see a board of the menu or a plastic hand held version so you know what you should get here. Pretty much most people will get the single or double patty and it comes with the cheese. We tried that and also the Mushroom burger. Let's not forget the crinkle fries and the shakes here are just as popular amongst the crowds. Oh yeah, this place closes at 2am so it's pretty much busy all day long.   The regular burger is cooked thin and I would say medium rare. I thought it was good, but not great because I like a little char on the edges of the burger and I didn't get that. As for the fries, they reminded me like the cafeteria fries you get while in grade school. I'm sure Ore-Ida sells those in the freezer aisle as well.   However, what won me over was the 'Shroom burger that deceivingly looks like an onion ring but when you bite into it, cheese oozes out and it was also crispy on the outside. Terrific burger with their potato bun. The shakes here are awesome, they taste just like ice cream and the lady over the counter made cookies and cream just for us. Like a secret menu kind of thing.   Overall, food is good. The wait can be long for food (We waited 15 minutes longer than most people because we wanted unsalted fries).  The bathroom and tables were in dire need of a cleanup at 7pm. I basically had to clean a water spill at the only table I can get. They do have those wipes by the trash/ketchup condiment station in which you can clean yourself as well.  So I probably wouldn't come back due to the wait but you can also DL their app so you can have it slightly quicker. The interior and music had this club like feel and the 4 different lemonades here are nice addition to the menu.",

The burger was good but I think In n Out burger is still better.  The price of Shake Shack is more expensive but it was small or maybe I was hungry?!

We heard a lot of our friends talk about the Shake Shack so we decided to give it a try.  The Shake Shack has a really nice contemporary vibe with many seating areas, inside and out.   I got the cheese burger with bacon and got cheese fries with bacon on top.  The burger was really good. It had so much flavor in it. I wanna say it's almost or equally as good as In-N-Out Burgers, and that's saying something.  The reason for the loss of star is because i ordered an ice cream cone but I was given a chocolate shake instead. Normally, it wouldn't be a problem, but I also ordered a drink. So I basically had two drinks.  But overall, a great place to eat, especially if you're drunk or recovering from a hangover from the night before.",

My experience at this location was less than average. Our menu choices were not available because the ingredients were all sold out - sold out of hot dogs and got the chicken dog.  It was just ok for $6.50.  A basic Nathan's dawg could have beat it easy.   Also there was no root beer, no cheese sauce, no water cups, no bacon, no mushrooms - this just neutralizes the greatness of what this burger could be.  It's disappointing because I hyped it up to my family and set the expectation higher than this location could deliver.  They basically thought it was an overpriced In-N-Out. Given that it's opening week for this new operation I can't fault Shake Shack too much.  I will come back in a few months and I'm sure they will sort things out for the better.    Milkshakes were on point and had that rich flavor and quality ice cream taste. You can rely on great shakes when you visit.  In fact, if you just came in for shakes and fries I think you would be Fatisfied!",

Bun was topped with sesame seeds and warm. Beef was seasoned. Their specify french fries, essential crinkle cut, were boiling hot and seasoned appropriate without need of additional salt or ketchup.   The milkshake of the week was the pumpkin pie flavor. The milkshake was a good balance of ice cream and pumpkin pie taste. Reminded me of eating pumpkin pie with whipped cream. Tasty. Not ice and not overly creamy. Would definitely order again.

The mushroom burger tasted like salted cheese burger. I only tried it once and I love mushroom but it was on the salty side. These days I don't do cheese in my burger because you lose the flavor of the meat with the cheese. I would do a cheese burger and meat with no veggie if thats what I craving for... like White Castle.",

    "text": "Ah the never ending battle of In N Out vs Shake Shack. Although there are many great food critics and blogs out there who have many opinions on this battle and each burger, I've decided to also throw my hat in the ring. Granted no one asked for a review, but I've proactively decided to give one.  What Shake Shack deserves a 5 star for is their Smoke Shack Burger and their Frozen Custard. The Smoke Shack burger is an amazing burger that doesn't just rival In N Out because In N Out has chosen to go the simple burger route. It's not a bad thing though. The burger is so moist and delicious with a bun that perfectly fits with the burger. Nothing is worse than a burger with a thick bun that sticks out like a sore thumb. It's like you're eating bread with a side of meat rather than a cohesive burger. Thankfully, Shake Shack and In N Out both do well with their buns.  As for their fries, they're very average. The are the same type of frozen crinkle cut fries that you buy at the store. The cheese fries isn't great either. It's practically nacho cheese. But even though they lack a bit on their fry game, In N Out is in a similar boat. Some people may disagree, but In N Out's fries are very mediocre as well. You can get it special ways by asking well done, but even still neither compare to a nice McDonald's fry.  So with all that, on the regular, I'd probably choose In N Out, but Shake Shack makes a valiant effort. It's a great option for when I want In N Out but with a bit more of a twist. But first it needs to become easier to access in Los Angeles.",

    "text": "I would usually wait to visit a couple of times before reviewing a new business, but Shake Shack managed to knock it out of the park on the first try, so here it goes...  They've been open for 2 days now and I figured it would be a mad house.  I was there around 4:30pm and although it was busy, they had plenty of cashiers and there was no line. (I had a friend who went around 12:30 and said that it was a 45 minute wait, so be prepared to wait during peak lunch hours)  The staff is all very friendly and helpful and there is a large menu just as you enter.  There are also paper menus at each cash register. As you order, you can see into the kitchen, which is always nice.  They seem to have more than enough staff to cover the opening. It appeared as if things were (basically) running smoothly. I did see a couple of hiccups while waiting for my order, but everything was fixed immediately.  I ordered take-out and it didn't take long for my food to be ready. The food is all reasonably priced, unlike most Strip restaurants.  The cashier gave me my receipt and a buzzer to notify me when my food was ready.  They have a couple of areas of counter space where you can get ketchup, mustard, napkins, mayo, etc. They even had to go cups for the condiments, which is nice.  The decor is super cute.  There doesn't appear to be tons of seating, but there are low tops, high tops and booths, along with a small round bench for people waiting for take out.  Now for the burger....I ordered the double Shack burger ($7.99), which is a very basic burger with 2 patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato and Shack sauce. I also ordered a side of crinkle cut fries ($2.95). For being \"no frills,\" this burger packed major flavor.  Consider me impressed.  The fries were also very good. I like that they are fat and not wimpy like some other places.  My coworker ordered the 'Shroom Burger, which is vegetarian. It's a fried Portobello mushroom, filled with both cheddar and muenster cheese, topped with lettuce and tomato and Shack Sauce. I love meat, but this seriously looked and smelled so delicious that I can't wait to try it.  I also can't wait to go back for the desserts - they obviously specialize in shakes, but they make theirs with custard instead of ice cream.  They have a great beer selection, and I love that they have made an effort to support local businesses (Bad Beat Brewing has a beer on tap and Gimme Some Sugar's banana peanut butter cheesecake is in the All Shook Up concrete).  They are also active in the community, with 5% of sales from the \"All Shook Up\" concretes going to the First Friday Foundation.  I expect this place to be very successful, and they are off to a great start!",

    "text": "I had been in the Democratic State Convention for four hours when it was time for a lunch break. I can't think of many more times in my life when a beer and something delicious were so important.  The line at this Shake Shack is ridiculously long, but I was really impressed with how fast they got everyone through--it's obvious they took care in the design and staffing to make sure folks don't have to wait too long to eat.  Recently, they added a fried chicken sandwich to their menu, and a fried chicken sandwich is one of the world's best foods. It was delicious, though I definitely should have added cheese. Also stuck with my usual cheese fries which are never disappointing.  Now, if you're a normal Shake Shacker, I'd definitely give the chicken sandwich a try. It's a nice addition for them and sticks to the quality and taste you're expecting. However, if you're an infrequent visitor, I'd probably stick with the burger (if that's your usual). The chicken sandwich is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not *as* good as the burger.   After I finished eating, it was exciting and a little bit naughty to get to take the rest of my beer with me on my walk back to the convention. Don't laugh, it's the Reno girl in me.",

    "text": "Would I say that this place is comparable to In N Out? My answer is NO! Although this place is probably considered fast food, the quality is  just as good as a sit down restaurant.  Shroom Burger:  This is the vegetarian burger. The meat is replaced by a portobello mushroom, with  some added cheese, the entire thing is then battered and fried until it is crispy. Mmm Mmm GOOD! I am a sucker for fried stuff and this place does it right. The outside of the mushroom was super crispy but not  super oily which is slightly better for my health.  If you decide to try this, BEWARE of the hot cheese when biting into the burger, because that stuff seriously burns!  Fries:  I am a sucker for thin crunchy fries, unfortunately shake shack's version is crinkle fry which has more potato. I was not very impressed with this, but in this case it was based on a personal preference.   Frozen Custard: I got a chance to sample a spoonful of my friend's frozen custard flavors. One of them got the vanilla and it was pretty good, definitely tasted better than the Wendy's freezie. Whereas, another person got the S'more's flavor. This was just alright in my eyes because it was just all chocoate and graham cracker crumbs on top. Personally, I liked the vanilla more out of the two.  Final Verdict:  This is the first time that I have eaten something like the Shroom Burger, so unless I can find a better variation of it than I will keep coming back!",

Sadly, this Shake Shack was nothing compared to the one I had in NYC. Both my friend and I was hyping it up so much to our other friends. However, after we took a couple bites of our burgers... we just sat there in despair. The burger turned out to be very disappointing. My friend looked like she was about to cry. I also wasn't told that the burger was gonna be rare/medium rare. I didn't think it would be that bad, and the line was kinda ridiculous so I just ate my burger anyway. Of course I had a little date with the bathroom after the meal............  In this case, In N Out totally kicks Shake Shack out of the ball park! In N Out is the same everywhere, and their prices are UNBEATABLE! The burger here was $5+ for a reg. cheeseburger. Fries came separately too. And a drink... you're looking at $16 for a meal you can get an In N Out for about $7. Uhmmmmmmmmmmmmm",

But sitting down at Shake Shack, the roommate whispered to me, \"This is like an overpriced Wendy's.\" I didn't think that exact same thing, but I kind of agreed with him.  *SmokeShack: cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce ($6.69 single) The roommate's burger. I had a bite. I thought the meat to bun ratio was a little off. More bun than meat.  *Shack stack: cheeseburger and a 'shroom burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce ($9.49) My burger. Besides this being hard to eat due to the height, I thought the mushroom overpowered the whole thing. Plus the breading was too thick and hard. I did enjoy the mushroom by itself though. Without the breading.  *Shack-cago: shack relish, onion, cucumber, pickle, tomato, sport pepper, celery salt and mustard ($4) The roommate wanted to try a dog as well. I took a bite. It reminded me of a Chicago dog.  *Cheese fries: topped with our special blend of cheddar and american cheese sauce My favorite thing we ordered! The fries were good and the cheese sauce was yummy.  Drinks: *ShackMeister ale: brewed exclusively for Shake Shack by Brooklyn Brewery ($6.50 for 16oz) *Fountain soda: Coke ($2.75 large)  I don't get it. Both the roommate and I had friends that adore Shake Shack and told us we HAD to go. Maybe it's better in NY, but I wasn't impressed.",

Although it is a little pricey (compared to In n Out), the quality of the ingredients and taste are sooooooo worth it. Who knew a simple burger and fries could be so mouthwatering?  I came here twice during my vacation and know it is going to be my first stop when I return to Vegas. You know how some people are obsessed with eating at Earl's Sandwiches?

    "text": "I only came here for their shakes as I think they're the best shake out there (coming from someone who grew up going to In-N-Out). This location is on par with all the shakes I've had at their NYC locations so huge thumbs up there!  Only complaint is that this is the busiest Shake Shake that I've ever been to which says a lot since they're all busy no matter which location you go to. We were hoping to go through the line outside that only sold shakes & malts, but we could tell the longer line inside was actually moving more quickly. What we didn't realize is that we'd have to wait longer for our order to be called in that line since it'd be competing with people getting full meals. Oh well.   But in the end, yes. Their shakes are still amazing. I won't compare the food to In-N-Out because they're just different. Just keep that in mind. In-N-Out does their thing. Shake Shake does theirs. Why can't you just enjoy both equally? I know I do!",

We were sitting near the restroom and happened to see two employees  cleaning or trying to at least to clean the restroom. ( female ). One girl goes in and comes out laughing, other girl said something to the nature of watch it someone is in the stall. Then she goes in, at this time a customer comes out in a hurry and looked back embarrassed but she walked outside.  Then comes out the other employee laughing. Both employees now laughing all the way to the counter/ kitchen area letting everyone know and laughing for over 4 minutes that the restroom smelled. Various other female customers were a bit mad that they would come out laughing and embarrassed a customer. Those two would not work in my retail stores. They need training in customer service skills. If u see employees near restrooms prepare to be embarrassed. At your own risk. The two ladies that had great customer service and not sure who the are, but one took our order an the other one was trying to clean the tables.",

    "text": "The first time I had Shake Shack burger was when I was in N.Y.C 5 years ago. That time, I was not quite impressed with In 'n Out as a basis (I am an Angeleno). I heard how popular this burger chain in the East Coast and slowly coming here in the West side.   Couple of weeks ago, I went to Vegas with my family. Upon hearing that there's a Shake Shack that recently opened along Las Vegas strip, I was eager to give it a try again before going back to L.A.....and that time, I was impressed.  I ordered a cheese burger. What I like about this burger is that the patty is the thickest one I've ever had recently. As most of the burger chains's patties have been shrinking, Shake Shack maintained the same thickness of patty I had 5 years ago. Thumbs up!! I also had French fries and chocolate milk shake, which there were nothing special.   It was a very busy night, and so, our orders got messed up and missed a lot of orders. However, they were corrected promptly after telling them what we were missing. And also because it was very busy that night, it took a while to get our orders.   I was glad that I gave it another try. Although I'm still an In 'n Out fan, I'm very enthusiastic about them branching out here in West Hollywood.",

    "text": "So the first time I tried Shake Shack was in New York, and it was delicious when I went there. Having been born and raised in California, I was extremely skeptical about Shake Shack because people kept comparing it to In N Out. I'm not completely opposed to Shake Shack but I definitely prefer In N Out for its quality of food and lower cost.   I have to say that Shake Shack has some perks, especially with its large variety of burgers and shakes. The location in Vegas is good and I'll definitely go again if I'm in town and want something quick to eat. The major downside to Shake Shack is how pricey each item is. To me, everything was slightly smaller portioned and greasier than the same item from In N Out. For example, I ordered a cheeseburger and shake and my total came out to be about $15. Whereas, I could've ordered the same thing plus fries at In N Out for about $7. ",

We ordered a chicken sandwich and 2 regular cheeseburgers plus an order of fries. One burger had no sauce and tomatoes due to a food intolerance. Also included were two arnold palmer and a custard. The food was good but In N Out is better. The meat and bun ratio is off, the fries aren't fresh like In N Out and the custard was thick but still reminded me of ice cream. At least the design had a nice modern feel.",

    "text": "The first time I ever had Shake Shack was in Chicago and I'm glad I tried it. I had never heard of it before until I watched a Top 10 video on YouTube for best fast food burger places. To my surprise the number one spot went to Shake Shack. I was so confused because I had never even heard of the restaurant before. I quickly googled it and found out there was one in the very city I was living in! After that first taste of Burger Shack, I was sold.  The Las Vegas Shake Shack is no different from any other location I've been to. It's always packed. Be prepared to stand in a long line depending on what time you go. I've seen the lines coil or go out the front door. Also prepare to see some high prices for fast food burgers. They may look intimidating, but I personally think it's worth it.  This Shake Shack has a very large dining area which was great. It was packed but my partner and I were still able to find seating. Every time I've gone the workers have been very nice and high energy even though they are dealing with mobs of people.  Each time I've went I've gotten a burger, fries (sold separately) and a shake. I'll be honest and say I ordered a SmokeShack burger each time. I love the SmokeShack and since I don't visit Shake Shack a lot I always have a taste for this burger.  The SmokeShack has the ShackSauce, cherry peppers, and smoked bacon. Everything blends perfectly together. The ShackSauce gives it a savory sweet flavor, the peppers add a nice acidic bite, and the bacon gives it a smoky and (need I say it?) a bacon flavor. The burger patties are flattened, but that gives them that crispy outer texture and the flavor of the meat is that delicious, rich, fatty beef flavor that I know most people are looking for in a burger. The hamburger buns are nice and fresh which just adds to the experience. The hamburger buns are fresh which just adds to the experience.   My one gripe is that I wish the burger was bigger. As far as fast food burgers go, these burgers are small. Even the double isn't very big. I'm not sure if the price of the burger matches the size. The quality does though.  The fries are delicious. They are crinkle cut so when cooked well they have that perfect crispiness. I felt that they are salted well and they match well with the burgers. As for the shakes, they are the one thing that I would say are a must (if you like ice cream that is). I've tried the peanut butter, mud pie, and pumpkin pie shakes. Each time the shake has been very thick to the point where it's difficult drinking through the straw (I like that) and each time the shake has exceeded my expectations. They truly taste like their ingredients except magnified. It tasted like I was eating an ice cream pumpkin pie when I had the shake. They are amazing and the restaurant definitely lives up to its name.  If you eat at Shake Shack be prepared to spend more than you would at other fast food restaurants. But also be prepared to have very high quality fast food. It's rare for me to find food where I think the quality outshines the price/quantity, but Shake Shack pulls it off. However, I don't think I would enjoy it as much without getting the whole meal. I think collectively the meal deserves a 5. Definitely give it a try.",

Definitely more expensive, that's for sure, but you're getting some real high quality burgers.  I got the SmokeShack burger, which is jam-packed with bacon, cherry peppers, and a delicious Shake Shacksauce. Sooo yummy! And at the perfectly satisfying size. However, the Double Down Fries (which are dressed exactly like my burger: crinkle-cut fries loaded w/ bacon, cherry peppers, etc.) were a little underwhelming... I know what you're thinking -- getting them anyway was my boyfriend's idea! Anyway, I wish they had some other crazy fries to choose from.",

I will have to say their bun = amazing. The patty was great and unlike In-N-Out you can customize your burger more + add in more condiments and additional toppings (if you're into that).  But the size of the food + price of it (really, that's all the fries I get?)... I just felt underwhemed for what I ended up paying.",

The shack stack was definitely good but for the price I'd rather go get a gourmet burger and pay slightly more. Good food. Line isn't too bad. And I like that you can preorder online unlike in n out.

The burger had fried shallots which were a great addition. Put that on the list of ideas that someone should have thought of sooner. My issue is that the burger seemed kinda smallish. I got the double and paid $8.99 I think. I guess for that amount I'm either expecting a larger burger or one with premium meat.  The burger wars are really heating up on the Vegas strip and Shake Shack benefits from a great location just outside New York New York.  Overall I'd put this place maybe on par with Bobby Flay's place a block down but nowhere near as good as the Broadway Burger Grill inside NY-NY.",

    "text": "Been here numerous times and it never disappoints! I normally get the shack stack, which is a cheeseburger with a cheese stuffed fried mushroom. I've also tried the ShackBurger and the Chick'n Shack, which are really good too. Their buns are really soft and aren't cut all the way through, so that your burger doesn't fall out through the bottom.  Must try the fries. Classic crinkle cut fries, perfectly done. I love their black and white shake, but they have different rotating flavors all the time.   You can park at New York New York or at the Park (same parking structure) and walk towards the Strip right across from Monte Carlo.",

Like I soldier, I go to Shake Shack 2 hours later. Gotta do it. Stomach pump me later!  You've had these burgers before. They are sometimes under the names of Jim's, Jakes, Hi-Life, Johnny's, or any burger joints you find on the roadside. It's the same thing, but perfected. Delicious. Seasoned and grilled at the right temperature. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and toasted buns.  There's a shakesauce but I think it's just thousand islands. Not sure.  You've also never experienced a roadside joint like this. It's upscale for this type of food and a fun decor. They also gave me a hamburger wristband during my visit!! You'll be paying upscale prices and that's my beef with this place. Whereas with Jim's you can get a combo for $5. Here? Double that.  Is it worth twice the amount? Are you getting whoppered if you do? $10 for the perfect roadside burger once or twice a year I would do in a heartbeat. I wish I had room for the ice cream. I heard that's really good.",

They serve crinkle style fries which is might sound unappetizing because it can remind you of those elementary school days, but they are so crispy and soft. Unlike In n Out, these fries are still good even after 20 minutes so you don't have to down them as soon as you get them. It is on the pricey side, especially when the same meal at In n Out is around $6. I ordered the hamburger with special sauce, fries, and a lemonade and the total was around $11. Overall, if you're in the area, I really recommend this place especially because it is one of the cheaper places in Vegas.",

Also, they have root beer on draft. BEST. ROOT BEER. EVER.   ugh, my mouth is watering from just writing this review. Thank gawd I don't have to fly to the east coast to have this again!",

    "text": "-- 63/100 Reviews of 2016 --  Four Star Friday!!!! I wasn't gonna wait til' a NY trip to try Shake Shack, so when I got the chance to visit, I definitely jumped on it.     Better than In-N-Out? It depends.  They do have a wider variety than your usual \"hamburger or cheeseburger- with or without onions\" menu, but to each their own.    My sister and I tried the Shroom Burger with crinkle fries. For some odd reason, we both had missed the \"vegetarian\" note on the menu and we were expecting a full on mushroom burger WITH a beef patty and then some, but we were surprised to notice within several bites in, that it was just breaded mushroom. A little confused? Yes. Disappointed? Yes. Did I hate it? No, it was actually quiet tasty. We were just in shock haha. The burger consisted of a crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce for $6.99. I loved the potato bun!  It was soft and yummy (oh, and non-GMO, as of last year!)  The crinkle fries were fried to a nice golden crisp, very enjoyable with peppered ketchup (try it!) - And since we were already indulging, we also had to order shakes.  After all, it IS called Shake Shack for a reason, right?   I decided to go with the Salted Caramel milkshake and my sister, a chocolate milkshake. YUMYUMYUM. The Salted Caramel was muy delicioso! Sweet, but the salt and caramel were both apparent. Dipping a fry or 10 also works wonders to the palate! The chocolate milk shake reminded me of a rich, dark Tablea (Filipino hot chocolate). Not too much a fan of, but my sister loved it!   ***Side note: Jay suggested to get the Stack Shack burger next time (Beef patty WITH the portobello mushrooms). Yes, I will definitely try that next time haha.  Pros:  - Affordable prices - Dog-friendly! Doggie Menu for your pup(s) - Great location off the corner of New York New York Hotel & Casino - Milkshakes are a must! (Bathroom-worthy for super lactose intolerant people like me :/ lol) - Plenty of tables available (booths, long tables, patio tables, picnic tables, etc.) - Plenty of TV's to catch the games - Jay the busser was very personable & friendly compared to the cashiers  Cons: - The employees need to smile more!!!  Overall, I couldn't really compare my Shroom burger to an In-n-Out burger because of the mushroom ordeal, but I still did have a pleasant experience and would return again when given a chance.",

The Grand Central, Times Square, CPW, DC locations were all a bit disappointing the last few times I tried, but I think this one really hit the mark, maybe because they're making it a point to set a good rep in farther flung markets, with talks of IPO and all that.  All items are recommended. Would rotate through and give everything a try. And I wouldn't invite comparisons to In N Out--they're pretty different. In general I think the individual ingredients here are more \"premium\" though the flavors aren't as unified or as unique as you might hope. I just had a burger from Belcampo in LA today that tastes about the same, except Shake Shack has better bread.",

The atmosphere is great, guest service up to par, the decor inviting and clean. The food on the other hand is far over priced for what you receive. $5.19 for a standard single shake burger which seems much smaller than it should be.  The marketing of this restaurant appears to be following the latest hip trend of serving your food to you on an aluminum sheet and simple, trendy decor. The latest Taco Bell concept called US Taco in Huntington Beach CA followed the same model with little success.  Final verdict for Shake Shack to me is, stick to In-n-out.",

We ordered and then waited another 10-15 minutes before our food was ready.  A good strategy to have would be to have one person order and the other go hunt down a seat to avoid a fist fight.  The dining room is fairly large but people were packed in there like sardines.    I ordered a single Shack Burger with cheese and cheese fries.  The burger had really nice flavor and was cooked to my liking.  The burger was very small...that was one downside.  The cheese fries were okay.  If I ever visit again...I agree with another Yelper...order two burgers and skip the fries.  Milkshake and concrete weren't very special.  Shake Shack serves up a legit burger, but the overall experience was not worth the hype, price, or wait time to eat.",

However service was extremely slow, especially at the cashier station. At one time, they only had 1 cashier when more than 50 people were in line. The wait for my burger was about 45 mins.   To compare, its more like San Francisco's Super Duper more than West Coast In & Out. Prices are higher for Shake Shack.   The restaurant itself has a lot of seating and room. Clean. Expect a long wit on the weekends.",

    "text": "Thank you Buzzfeed!  Oh sorry, bad very bad, fake news.  A secret menu promised the most beautiful slice of chocolate cake.  Lies, all lies.    Sorry, too much Colbert lately.  No chocolate cake but the secret menu has two True stand outs; a burger and a hard beverage.  The first, released for one day, then pulled over concerns of peanut cross contamination, the second, who knows.  Both remains unpublished and unlisted but even on the Vegas Strip, they know what you want when you order them.   Peanut Butter Bacon Burger - The solid, salt and pepper seasoned single hamburger, meaty applewood smoked bacon and a side of peanut butter sauce.  Just pour the sauce over the patty and let the residual heat do the rest, making a oozing, slimy coating as the melting peanut sauce mixes with the beef fat.  Sounds horrible but wow, it works.  Shandy - Half and half mix of their Shack made lemonade and ShackMeister Ale.  Weird combo that somehow washes everything down without being off tasting..  Hair of the dog or just needing to cool down from the rising Vegas heat.  Oddly refreshing with its sour citrusy notes, sweet punch from the sugar, and bitter notes of the beer.  The two go together like peas and carrots, \"run Jeffery run!\"  Oops too much SNL.  Fast food and a Strip experience.  Strip proper fast food service.  Inflated Strip prices.  Good in a pinch when playing tourist but not destination worthy.",

    "text": "As fine as it was, I don't quite see what all the hub is all about... Sorry if I just completely offended the entire city of Vegas and New York combined!     It was totally packed and is an restaurant that everyone needs to go to at least once in their life, but I probably won't be making it a #1 priority in my life anytime soon.   We got everything \"Shack\" on the menu. The burger, the fries, the chicken burger, the hot dog, and the custard treat to top it off. Here's a little \"mini\" review of each.   Burger: Could've done without it. It was just a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and a tomato--I'm pretty sure I could've make a tastier one, and that's saying something because my PB&J's are still subpar...   Chicken burger: This was a winner in my book! Get it. The chicken was juicy and had a perfect crispness to it. Not only that, but the PICKLES helped boost it to the next level. Seriously, this was the best choice of the night.   Fancy Hot Dog: The \"Shack-ago Dog\" was fine too. It had a pickle spear, some very strong onions, and some gnarly peppers. I've never been a fan of hot dogs; however, if you are, you might like it.   Fries: They were crinkle cut and I'm sure were very good when they initially came out of the fryer, but I think ours had sat for a hot minute before our buzzer called us to the window because they were slightly floppy. We got cheese fries with the cheese on the side, and that was a good decision seeing as those floppy fries would've been toast by the time we started eating!   Custard: Pretty melted by the time our hot food met up with it on the tray, but the chocolate and brownie bites were delicious!   The employees were quick and helpful, and the atmosphere was fun too. We did have to wait for about 1/2 an hour, but that's normal considering we got enough food to feed an army. Again, it was a pleasant experience just not one I'd make time for again.   TIPS & TRICKS:  * If you dig the heat, there is seating outside with some nice \"misters\" to help cool you off!  * Park in the New York New York garage, and if you can order and eat in under an hour, your parking is free!",

    "text": "Like many things that migrate from NYC, Shake Shack didn't quite live up to the enormous hype.  It's a quality fast food burger, but by no means is it the \"Best Burger in the World!\" as others might suggest.    Stopped in on a Monday night and the line wrapped almost to the entrance.  The ordering is quick and efficient so it only took about 10 minutes to get the to front of the line.  I ordered the Smoke Shack and Cheese Fries with a small drink ($15.00).  The cashier was nice enough to let me know that there were free refills when I tried to order the large drink.  Food took about 10 mins and despite being packed there were plenty of open tables.  The burger had a nice soft bun with smoked bacon, cheese and slightly spicy red peppers.  I had seen on TV that Shake Shack uses a secret blend of ground beef for their patties, but after the peppers, I really couldn't taste the beef.  The burger is pretty small, but by the end I was full.  Cheese fries were nice and crispy, but the cheese sauce was pretty tame american cheese sauce.  It's impossible for cheese fries not to be good, but these were nothing to write home about.  I will take In-N-Out Animal Style fries over these any day.    What really impressed me about Shake Shack were the employees and how smooth everything ran.  One thing I regret is not trying are the shakes and desserts.  Those looked great.    It may sound like I didn't enjoy Shake Shack, but I did.  However, Las Vegas has sooo many great burger joints that I have to compare accordingly.    My Recommendation: If you're in need of a quick, affordable bite on the strip, Shake Shack will please almost everyone.  If you have more time and a few extra $'s there are plenty of burger joints, like Burger Bar by Hubert Keller, that offer a better value and tastier burger.  If you have a car, go to in-N-Out for a double double animal style meal for 1/2 the price.",

    "text": "Been wanting to come to Shake Shack for years because people kept saying that it was way better than in-n-out. I was actually pretty excited to try it out today and I must say that it was very underwhelming. I ordered the double hamburger with everything on it. I decided to add bacon for $1.55, which brought the total to $8.80. My friends' burgers ended up being slightly over $10 each. The burgers definitely had decent charred flavor, but it was nothing out of this world.   The pros:  - You can order beer and wine (who drinks wine with a burger??) - The produce in the burgers are more fresh than in-n-out's - The workers here are nice - You can purchase overpriced treats for your dog (maybe I should put this into cons)   The cons:  - Burger is small... I would even categorize it as petite. After I ate here, I was still so hungry that I drove over to tacos el gordo to pick up 4 tacos.   - The cost of my burger was as much as 2 double doubles and fries at in-n-out (this was definitely not twice the quality)   My 2 friends and I ordered different burgers and we all came to the same conclusion... it's not worth checking out again. We would much rather go to in-n-out because it is similar quality at a significantly cheaper price point. Hell, go pay a few more bucks at Bachi Burger for something memorable. If you're in NorCal, go check out Val's burgers in Hayward, CA.... now that's a burger.   This place is perfect for people who have never tried it and want to see what the hype is all about. Other than that, it's good for people who have the appetite of a prepubescent child.",

The first time I ever ate here, I tried the SmokeShack, which is basically a bacon cheeseburger. It was sooo good! However, every other time that I've been here, I always order the 'Shroom Burger and I can't get enough of it. Instead of a hamburger patty, they use a fried portobello mushroom that is filled with cheese. I don't know why, but it hits the spot every single time. The fries have the perfect amount of crunch and are really good whether or not they are topped with cheese. Another great thing is that there is a \"no bun\" option for the health-conscious people who want to indulge in a burger, but want to skip the carbs. Last, but not least, get a shake! They are delicious and perfect during the summer when its extremely hot outside. I've tried the strawberry, coffee and cookies & cream shakes and have not been disappointed.",

The burgers are small nor does it have the flavor you want to savor in your mouth. I never end up finishing my portion. I also don't get appeal of the crinkle fries. Reminds me of the frozen microwaveable fries.   Not sure how this even compares to In-N-Out! Nothing was good and is overpriced.",

This place is fairly large and situated in a new courtyard area outside of New York New York Casino.  The menu is pretty limited there are only a few burgers, shakes, custard ice cream blends and fries.  We tried a cheeseburger and the Stack along with cheese fries.   The burgers were hot juicy and very reasonably priced for vegas about $6. My burger had a deep fried mushroom patty along with the burger patty which was cool but it really didn't add as much flavor as I thought it would.  There was cheese inside the mushroom patty and it was BURNING hot so be careful if you order this item.   The cheese fries were excellent better than the burgers in my opinion.  Overall we were not impressed by Shake Shack, the food is good but not great, but the prices were FAB for Vegas.  In and Out Burger is pretty much the same thing for us peeps on the west coast. I am a fan of custard style ice cream so we will have to come back and give Shake Shack another try.",

    "text": "East Coast Food on the Vegas Desert...   Great tasting food and shakes at reasonable prices.  I definitely tasted the freshness.  I enjoyed a Smoked Shack Burger which came with applewood smoked bacon, grilled onions, diced red pepper, lettuce, tomato and cheese!   I also tried a Chicago Dog which was very delicious and filling... Just wish I devoured it first as it did get a bit soggy.  My wife added fries, a shake and a regular Shack Burger.  The restaurant was packed on a midweek late dinner time (10pm) but the lines moved quickly.  I like that there are communal dining areas as well as individual areas. There were also huge TVs and an unbeatable view of the Las Vegas Strip.   I'll be back again for sure but now I have the dilemma of determining which burger joint I like the best...   It's a toss up between the West Coast In N Out...",

Crazy atmosphere , located on the strip by New York New York. Almost took me back home with the Brooklyn bridge and of course lady liberty. Had to order something with bacon with it and the fries with shake.   Overall the service was alright can't throw down the perfect 10/10 rating. Very packed when I got there. Long lines considering it's the strip and everyone wanted to grab something to eat late at night. Seats were plentiful but the back of the restaurant were reserved for the homeless. I didn't mind, they were probably having a blast.   I can recommend it to people but they already have tried it. Who hasn't???? But give this location a try, worth the trip. Sadly parking is now the devil on the strip. Ty MGM!!",

    "text": "East Coast competition is always trying to go for a show down in the West Coast. Who has a better burger? Well, in my opinion, it depends on the tier. This place would get tortured against Plan Check. But against, In N' Out, that would be a fair match.  It's been a number of years since I've been to Shake Shack. The last time was in 10 degree weather in Manhattan walking a mile back and forth to my sister's place. Yup, we had frozen custard too. I remember the burger being good but not memorable.   This time in Vegas, I was able to try Shake Shack again. Located at the storefront of New York New York where the roller coasters once ran, the portion facing Las Vegas Blvd. has been renovated with stores new walkway.   I ordered a SmokeShack which is a cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and Shacksauce. I also ordered fries and a Shack Attack Concrete.  The burger itself is very good. It's tasty, meaty seasoned well. The bacon is good makes the burger a bit saltier. Cherry peppers give slight kick and enhanced flavor. Fries are nothing special to my liking. Definitely doesn't seem like it comes from fresh potatoes. The Shack Attack was my dessert for the day and pretty good. It's a chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough (thought it was a brownie), dark chocolate chunks, and chocolate sprinkles. Honestly, I liked this better than the burger. The only thing is that I didn't notice fudge sauce unless it got lost in the concoction of ingredients. I also had Abita Brewing draught root beer. This was more sugary than anything else. I missed the strong flavor of sarsaparilla.   The interior is pretty cool with lots some communal seating. Great for catching a game. The vibe is more homely and a variety of other items including hot dogs, shroom burger, cold brew, beer, and wine.   So who wins? In N Out of course. Nothing beats the freshness of In N Out's ingredients of bread made that day, meat never frozen, and freshly cut lettuce and onions (hold the tomato). There is a difference and I can tell. In terms of value, it's about twice the cost.   Shake Shack is a solid burger but I've had burgers similar. I've had Wagyu Chuck at 4th Street Market in Santa Ana and there is a resemblance. Definitely a cool spot to visit. Try the Concretes (frozen custards) for sure. I'm still a fan. Come to LA. I'd come back.",

This place seemed over-hyped, however it did provide a satisfactory experience.  I enjoyed the burger, fries, and shake.  On the other hand, I have enjoyed my meals from In-N-Out equally, if not more, than Shake-Shack.  Why did I give it a four? - Good experience, but considering the typical wait and overall taste, I'd say it was satisfactory.  Perhaps a second visit will make this experience stand as above average.  Verdict? - Try it out.",

Fresh bun, fresh meat, good ingredients. But..... For the price.... I could've eaten at a gourmet Burgr (As in Gordon Ramsey's place across the way).   Shake Shack is a staple. It is a must visit when in NY so when at the NYNY in LV, it's also a must visit as well.   Go check them out. Holiday GingerBread shake is amazing!   Service? Fast, friendly. There was no wait when I went so the food came out fast. The ones in NY are always packed.",

I grew up with In N Out but lived in NYC for 6 years, and while I don't like comparing the two, I like both for different reasons. Yes, Shake Shack is more expensive compared to In N Out, but you get a different burger, totally different fries, and more options on shakes and malts (plus they have treats for your pup).   This location is outside the New York New York hotel and has the same look as all the other Shake Shacks. There's an express line outside for drinks only, with full orders taken inside. There's lots of seating inside and out, with TV screens all throughout the interior. Get the shack burger, cheese fries and any of their shakes. You won't be disappointed.",

Can't wait to visit the Glendale, CA location and continue my journey through the menu.  They have a very efficient and fast way to order with the registers open and tons of available seating so if you see a line outside, don't let that discourage you. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!  The burger is good enough to eat alone. The beef is perfect with just the right amount of fresh lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The bun was perfect. It made the burger. Don't know what they make it out of but it's not too flaky or hard. Its's soft and fresh and absorbs the juices to make it a perfect burger.   Trust me on this, you'll like it.",

Their patties are never too greasy, buns are soft and lightly toasted, and the fixings are always fresh. People usually forget that Shake Shack started off as a hot dog stand but give the Shack-cago Dog a try and you'll realize that Shake Shack is more than just burgers and shakes. On that note, you have to order their crinkle cut fries too and if you like cheese, definitely add that cheese sauce. It's straight up liquid crack, it's so addictive!  The frozen custard is also ridiculously creamy and delicious. I just tried their holiday cookie flavor this week and it just might be my favorite yet, too bad it's seasonal. Vanilla is usually my default when ordering.  The interior is spacious and even though in recent times I feel like Shake Shack is becoming insanely popular, the ordering line moves fast and usually a table will open up while you're waiting for your food to be ready. It's a surprisingly relaxing place to eat and the staff is always kind. Even though they close at midnight, they'll accept orders right up to the last minute and they won't kick you out if you happen to be inside still past midnight.",

Next, I got the Smoke Shack (Crispy bacon, cheese, and cherry tomatoes on a well cooked patty and a warm fluffy bun). I got the cherry peppers on the side since the flavor is sometimes overbearing for me (I can't handle anything remotely spicy). But I liked doing this since I could then control the flavor and how many or little I put in my burger. So, if you're anything like me, it's worth a shot.   INTERIOR: Busy, busy, busy! It is SO hard to find an indoor seat here. And it's a little chaotic (Think...fast food joint on steroids!) So be prepared to either sit outside, wait like a cheetah trying to pounce on a table, or take your food to go! Ooh, but also random side note: they play the games here (football, basketball etc.), but they don't have subtitles or sound.  I honestly can't express how great Shake Shack is. Please, oh please try this out for yourself, you won't regret it (I never do). Oh, how I wish I were in Vegas right now so I could taste those ooey gooey bacon cheese fries and that oh so crispy SmokeShack!",

    "text": "So the battle of the west coast burgers... In-n-out weighing in at about $2-3 each vs. Shake Shack weighing at about $5-9  So this is a review for Shake Shack but let me give you a little comparison... In-n-out: --Mouthwatering? Yes. Both burgers and fries. --Variety? Not really, but easily customizable. --Shakes? Good. Nothing special. --Line? Yes. Always but eh...it comes with the price of good food. --Price? Yes. Post grad student friendly.  Shake Shack: --Mouthwatering? Yes. Burgers and cheese fries are yum! --Variety? Yes. From different burgers to hot dogs to shakes to fries and even for your dog friend. Great selection for everyone! --Shakes? Good. Small though for what I'm paying for. Nothing to die for --Line? Very long line. But it moves VERY fast so don't be turned down --Price? Yeah...definitely on the pricey side...borderline not sure it's worth the price?   Overall...I think I'm going to end up going to In-n-out more. But yes, I am a fan! I personally loved the Shack Stack the most. Very filling and flavorful. You're paying for a good meal. Cheese fries are also a delicious and worth. It certainly does live up to the hype, my wallet just might not survive if I come back too often.  Also, there's big screens right by the pick up area. You won't have to miss out on a single game going on ;)",

    "text": "I went to a Shake Shack in another city last summer and had an experience that was less than stellar. Writing this review, you should know that Shake Shack sent me a gift card to make it up to me. I wasn't sure if I would ever use the gift card because there isn't a Shake Shack in my state. Behold, though, there is one in Vegas! So, I used the gift card from last summer for this experience. That gift card in no way influenced my review here, but I thought it best to be up front about that.   I love this Shake Shack for a number of reasons: 1) I love that is is close to the new park and that I can sit inside or out to eat my food, 2) I LOVE the prices. So much in Vegas is so overpriced. Shake Shack could charge double or triple what they normally charge and get by with it in Vegas, but they choose to go the route of integrity and charge their typical price, 3) Their burgers are just good, 4) Their custard is to die for, and 5) They stay open late, which means Shake Shack is going to give some of the overpriced places in NY, NY a run for their money.  That said, the fries are just okay. I ordered the cheese fries, and they were a little bland. I'm not sure if it is the fry itself or the cheese, but they weren't great.  The service was amazing, and the way the restaurant hustles folks through line is really good. I can see Shake Shack doing very well in this location in Vegas. I'm excited to add it to my list of places to visit when I'm there.",

    "text": "Located on the corner of New York New York, Shake Shack gets close to the real deal back in the Big Apple but ultimately falls short.  The lines aren't as long and out the door as the other locations I've visited in NY, Chicago, or Los Angeles so the wait to order wont be a slog. Additionally, service is very fast so you're sure to be in and out in no time. In regards to taste, the Shack Burger doesn't hold a candle to what we've had in Chicago, Los Angeles or New York. While it may look the same, well maybe a bit more sloppy, the taste wasn't there for me. Where the previous Shack Burgers I've had were juicy and flavorful, this locations Shack Burger was quite dry. The patties were misshaped and cooked well done. No amount of sauce of cheese could have saved it. Maybe the quick service isn't a good idea when you don't have the time to do some quality control. The fries were the same overpriced frozen crinkled fries.  Special to this location, they offer a Bacon Cheddar Shack Burger. This was definitely a winner with the cheddar cheese giving me flashes of Umami's truffle burger flavor. The bacon gave it a needed texture and smoky flavor to bring it all around. Its a bad day when your specialty burger tastes better than your \"iconic\" Shake Burger.  So is it a must try for anyone whose never had Shake Shack? For the Shack burger, I would say no. My friends are forever scarred by the dry Shack Burger and will refuse to ever eat another. I kid you not, he said he would rather have McDonalds than Shake Shack again. For the price you are paying, one would expect a burger that was put together with care, not a sloppy mess with a dry core.",

FYI, the burger is separate from ordering the criss cut fries, you can't make it a meal. ALSO, you have to tell them you want lettuce and tomatoes, otherwise it doesn't come with it. They give you the light up thing for when your order is ready and if you don't want to order a drink and just want water, there's a water dispenser on the side.  The wait wasn't too long and there's a good amount of seats inside and outside.  The verdict: The burger was just aight. Idk what the hype is, but it was okay, hella whatever. I expected a thick patty but it was hella whatever, no specific taste that made it stick out. The fries were plain too. Let me just say right when I took a bite into it, my I initial reaction was \"In N Out is way better.\" Especially for the price of the burger being $6+, I was hella disappointed.   It foreal is just the hype.",

I was too shocked to even respond and to think that in this day and age, we still have ignorant folk.   My given birth name is Jeff and I was born in the USA.  Not that it matters.  Even if I did have an \"Asian\" name, and even if it was accidental,  her comments was rude, ignorant, and racist.    It is what it is.  But Shake Shack coming from NYC, a place known for its diversity (as is Las Vegas), really should invest in cultural awareness training for their employees.  As for the food - mediocre.  I've had Shake Shack when in NYC, and I loved it there.  Warm and goey and delicious.  THIS SS really has lowered its standards.  My burger arrived cold.  The goey cheese inside the fried mushroom was chunky, not gooey.    They need to get their act together here.  In more ways than one.",

Then I found out they've come to good 'ol viva Las Vegas! Dream. Come. True.  It's right at the end of the \"Brooklyn Bridge\" at the NY NY hotel. The wait isn't too bad. You'll be shocked at the people waiting but the line moves fast!   For those who hasn't had the opportunity to try it back in the East Coast, they serve a variety of different cuisines from burgers, hot dogs, custards, and adult drinks. By far my favorite thing to get here is their Shack Stack. It's a burger stacked with a fried stuffed cheese portobello mushroom inside. Freaking amazing. It's seriously the best hangover cure ever. Order it with some custard shakes and cheese fries and it's freaking bomb.  My only gripe is that compared to In N Out, it's not fresh to made to order. You'll notice that there's a bunch of burgers pre-made under a heat lamp behind the counter. The freshness doesn't even come close to the burgers at In N Out. They do also have a secret sauce similar to In N Out called the shack sauce but I like In N Outs better.   Definitely a must try at least once. You can then compare which coast is better. West coast is definitely the best coast!!",

So first of all it's the 1st week of summer and to get to the shack is having to walk thru the desert heat.. And if you're lucky enough the line isn't too long you're able to stand in line inside and stare at the one huge menu on the wall.   So the food, I ordered the, Ionno, I forgot but it was like a double burger w/ bacon and a side of cheese fries and a drink. This order ran close to $17? Gotta be honest the first few bites were good but the 2nd half of it went down hill. I think all burgers should have some type of veggies to even out all the grease ur expecting to chow down on. The cheese fries.. That's all it was, a piece of cheese on top of some crinkle cut fries. Pretty weak. And to add more hate how can you mess up a medium soda? It was bland and watered down.   Well that's it for shake shack.. I won't be back. Next stop White Castle. I'm glad these guys aren't even mentioned towards In n Out.",

There was a long line. It did move at a good pace though. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My food was out in no time.  I ordered the ShackBurger and Cheese Fries. The burger comes topped with cheese, lettuce and ShackSauce. I opted for no tomato. The burger was juicy and tasty. The bun was solid as well. The sauce is a nice complimentary flavor. The single is more than enough burger.  The cheese fries come topped with a mix American and cheddar cheese as a sauce. The fries are good. The cheese was very good.  I was quite happy with both the fries and the burger. New Yorkers may over hype this somewhat, but it is still a very good burger.",

    "text": "You gotta love Vegas.  Where else in the entire country are you going to be able to get In n Out, White Castle, AND Shake Shack!?  I knew when I saw that Shake Shack had opened up in Vegas, that I had to eat there the next time I was in Vegas.  It is located by the New York, New York casino on the outside though, directly across the street from M&M world.  I was pretty excited to try it out and make the comparison between Shake Shack and In N Out.    The line was out the door long when we got there but it moved relaitvely quickly and gave us more than enough time to check out their pretty extensive menu.  They have a lot of things on their menu.  I remember seeing 4 different burgers, fries, a few different style of hot dogs and a bunch of delicious sounding shakes.  Their prices are a lot higher than In N Out but I feel like at Shake Shack you are not getting just a wholesome regular burger.  I feel like Shake Shack is more similar to 5 guys or The Habit than In N Out.  Price wise, when compared to those burger places is about the same.  There were plenty of seats despite how crowded it was.  The workers there do a pretty good job of moving the crowd and cleaning up tables.    We settled on a Shack Burger, a Shack Stack burger and cheese fries.  Their fries are amazing!  They are crinkle cut fries smoothered in a cheese sauce.  I love cheese.  My boyfriend and I had a disagreement because I wanted to just get one order but he insisted on two orders because he wanted fries and he knew that since they were covered in cheese I would end up eating all the fries and he would not get any.  We got two...he was right.  They are deliciious!  They are so much better than IN n Out fries which I was never a fan of.  I do not know why they are so good, but they are crisp, moist with just the right amount of saltiness.  My Shack Burger was okay, it came with tomato, Romaine lettuce, Shacksauce and cheese.  I do not know if I would pay $5.20 for it, I thought that was a bit pricey.  The burger was juicy and the sauce complimented it nicely.  I liked that they use Romaine Lettuce vs Iceberg.    The Shack Stack burger...now that thing was on a whole nother level.  It was basically the Shack burger but with a fried, cheese stuffed portobello mushroom inside.  Man, biting into that thing and the cheese exploding everywhere, wow.  That burger was almost $10, not sure if it was worth it either but I would say that was more enjoyable than the Shack Burger.    I did enjoy Shake Shack and I would say that I am a fan.  Hopefully they open one in Southern California sometime soon so I can enjoy it a little closer to home.  I would definately check it out.  The burgers are very good but remember to get the fries!  Those things are amazing!  I am going to have to try a shake from their next time I am in Vegas.  The flavor of the week when I went was buttery brown sugar....sounds like diabetes to me.",

And I know there are many comparisons of Shake Shack to In-n-Out, but I feel like even though they are both serving burgers and fries, it's quite different.  Shake Shack is good, on it's own, without comparing. And even if you were to compare, both are good. Delicious burgers and fries. Definitely would eat here again if given the option, but not to-die-for place to dine again.",

One word...\"WOW!!!\"  The food was amazing.  I went in full \"Fata$$\" mode.  I had a Shack Stack (Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce), a ShackMeister Dog (a hotdog topped with Shack cheddar and American cheese sauce and crispy ShackMeister Ale-marinated shallots), and Cheese Fries (fries topped with our special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce).  I also had a peanut-butter and banana shake which I wasn't a big fan of.  Let's get back to the food....it was amazing and everything lived up to the hype.  To make this experience even better, the service was outstanding.  Every person was attentive and they were extremely courteous.  I'm a resident of SoCal and love my In n' out, but Shake Shack is better in my opinion.  I will 100% be back when I'm in Vegas!!!",

Portion size would be small for a big eater. Place is clean, bright and has a nice energy. Service was friendly, but what the nicest touch was, a host came to clear our table and offered a refill on our large drink. Service is the key!  And of course good food. Great first experience!",

Some odd reason it seemed to take awhile for the food to get prepared.  People ordering burgers behind us were getting their meals before us.  For some unexplained reason, our order took longer than usual.  The double burger I had was good, but the fries were so so.  I was surprised that they serve beer!

The medium (degree of doneness) beef pattie was really juicy and flavorful. There was a good amount of super gooey cheese too! I downed this burger before I moved onto the crinkle cut fries...  Cheese Fries  --The cheese really makes a difference (my other friend also ordered the regular crinkle cut fries). This tastes like nacho fries. I wanted to keep eating more of these!!  Frozen Custard (Strawberry Cheesecake) --The custard tasted like a combination of frozen yogurt and ice cream. It was intensely rich and creamy, but unfortunately a bit too sweet for my liking. I ate most of the pint since my friends were too full or didn't like this as much after we ate our burgers and fries.   I found this burger place to be super satisfying and will try to come back for the burger with the shroom!!",

I know the West Coast is all about In N Out, but I have to say, Shake Shack takes my vote for being the better burger of the two.

There's a huge menu to look at when you're waiting in line, so that's helpful. I ordered the Shack Stack, which is the portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese and a ground beef burger. First of all, the cheese oozing out of the burger is orgasmic. Besides that, the burger itself tasted pretty plain and simple. In that case, I have to admit what I already believed: In-N-Out is better. I have to say that the cheese fries were the best thing here. It's so crispy for crinkle fries and smothered with melted cheese.   The location has such open space and I liked the picnic tables outside. It's a nice feel being located at New York New York as if you truly have a piece of the East Coast here.",

And grab a 50/50 while you're there (basically an Arnold Palmer).   I cannot recommend going here any higher to you.",

    "text": "If mortality has ever knocked on my door, it was definitely after eating at Shake Shack. Sadly, I will not be eating there again. I will however go into the positives of this cool new add to the New York New York in Las Vegas.   This is a great location along the strip and is accessible through the casino and outside. The line inside wraps around, until you reach a friendly person at the cash wrap. The menu is pretty straight forward and there is a lot to choose from. I went for a cheese fry, Shack Burger, and Mango Lemonade.   All good choices, I initially thought. The food came out fast, and I can appreciate that condiments are set aside for eaters to choose. There's free refills too, which I definitely think is way nice!  The mango lemonade, though sour with a touch of sweet, I feel is a nice attempt at a cool summer beverage; the bitter aftertaste I wasn't a great fan of. The burger was good. I wasn't raging over it, but hey, it was worth the try, I think. The cheese fries in retrospect I could do without, nothing special about it... Just... No... Cheese... Please.  Fast forward a couple hours, and meh, I couldn't. I couldn't stand by my nice thoughts about my first trip to Shake Shack. I got super sick afterwards. It's frustrating not knowing exactly what it was... Could have been the cheese, or maybe the meat was undercooked. Nothing tasted bad at first, but now, I can't even think about Shake Shack without thinking about how sick I've felt since eating there. :-(",

    "text": "The hype is real, y'all.   Burgers are juicy, cooked to medium perfection. I tried the Smoke Shack (the cherry peppers add a little bit of a kick that partners well with the crispy and salty bacon) and the ShackBurger (fresh veg that didn't overpower the meat and cheese combo).   The Chick'n Shack wasn't too shabby - the chicken was cooked well, kinda crispy breading that tasted slightly like the KFC breading of their original fried chicken. Though I enjoyed the potato bread they served these on, that was the only gripe of the people I was with. They said it tasted slightly sweeter than, say, the In and Out burger bun.   Fries are good - nothing extraordinary but don't mistake these crinkle cut fries for the ones they used to serve with hot lunches at school. These had a slight crunch on the outside and tasted fresh unlike the crinkle fries of the late night Del Taco run variety.   Now the shakes ... I've tried the seasonal Blueberry Pie Shake and then the Chocolate shake the next time I was here. Let me just say, if you like thick milkshakes, this is your jam. But even though the burger and fries combo doesn't look daunting it fills you up fast. So if you do order a shake, try sharing.   Would definitely go back to try the hot dogs people keep raving about.",

Shroom burger: so happy they had a vegetarian option! It was funny - the cashier clarified it had no meat and I told her I was aware (get the shack stack which has the mushroom and burger if you want meat). The mushroom was beautifully fried to a nice crisp, and it had so much cheese. YUM!  Cheese fries: I'm not a big crinkle cut fry person, I prefer shoestring fries. But these fries were really good!!! Crispy outside and not overly mushy inside. And did I mention cheese? Cheese makes everything better.  Blueberry pie oh my (concrete): honestly nothing spectacular. It was just soft icecream with a few pieces of blueberry pie but not much. Wouldn't order again.  The line was out the door when I went but it moves quickly! Also, I wish the burgers were larger (it's like 6 bites), but it's tasty and worth trying!",

The bun is soft vs the crisp bun at in n out. The sauce also didn't really taste like anything to me.

    "text": "I sort of want to give this place a 4 star, but since this was my first time, I'm reserving my opinion until I try it again (which I will).  This is the Shake Shack attached to the NYNY hotel/casino.  I was there during the Golden Knights playoffs (which I hadn't even known about) and omg, this place was insanely busy.  Swarms of people in and out!  And being right near TMobile arena where the game was held, you can imagine how crazy it was in there!  But hey, that's Vegas!    Anyway, after surviving the huge onslaught of people, I finally got a cheeseburger and fries.  Most burgers these days are pretty big, so I assumed (wrongly) that it would be fine to share with my guest who was with me.  Nope!  This is a small burger, so be forewarned if you want something that's a normal size, this one is small..  It also ain't cheap.  But I guess it is what it is these days, esp. on the strip.  The crinkle cut fries were good, too.      The good news is that I really liked this burger.  I wasn't too thrilled with the big piece of lettuce they put on it, but it's the meat on the burger itself that I really liked, probably better than any other fast food burger I've tried and I've tried a lot.  The bun was cold but that may just have been due to the huge rush and crowd of people in there.  Who knows?  That was a crazy location!    I also tried their frozen custard.  Never having had it before, I didn't know what to expect.  My guest has had it  numerous other places (out of state), and says this was  just okay, she's had better. A good frozen custard should have a more \"eggy\" flavor, which this didn't have. (in other words, it should actually taste like custard that's been frozen).   This tasted to me like very high quality homemade vanilla ice cream, which certainly isn't a bad thing!  I enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't get it again.  This Shake Shack has an indoor and outdoor seating area.  We ate outside because inside was a madhouse!  We ate at around 4pm and it was still fairly hot outside (and this wasn't even summer yet!).  Soooo, not sure how appealing the outdoor area will be once summer really kicks in.  I definitely am going to try another of their burgers at a different location in town, just to see how it goes.  But I may have to order two to get a decent amount of food, cuz these are just too small for my tastes!  (and I'm not a big eater!).  Shake Shack, make your wonderful burgers bigger!  I'm glad I tried this place, always fun to try new burger joints! For as crazy as the crowd in there was, the service proceeded fairly smoothly.  Hats off to the staff in there, they keep it moving!",

Well, first off, it's definitely NOT a shack...but it's Vegas, so what do you expect?   It's a big huge restaurant on the strip; should be called \"Shake Palace, the Shake Shack's big brother out west.\" Anyway, one thing to note is that you cannot access it from the New York New York hotel and casino; you have to be ON Las Vegas blvd to get there, but that's not a problem. So if you're parking you can park at either Ny ny or Monte Carlo, I think it'd be the same distance.  Burgers...same as the shake shack out east; flavorful burgers, a little on the smaller side when compared to the likes of in n out, but definitely tasty and you get more options than the former.  Any burger is good, esp the spicy ones, I usually go for two different types of single stacks, a regular and one of the other types and of course a hand-spun shake. And this being Vegas, we here have the option of alcoholic beverages with one's burger, always a plus.    Service staff, was good and friendly and they try to keep the line goin, but the place can get rather crowded and it's hard to find a table sometimes, so you'll have to find the best non-peak time to go.   BUT...as Vegas goes, you gave a ton of better options, so I would come here if I had a big craving for a shake, and if it wasn't busy and I was already close by. Otherwise, I would rather go to a Vegas Buffet or somewhere else...when in Rome...",

It's not necessarily cuz it's a three star place, but this place is overhyped and overpriced. It's a good burger, but you can find a burger this good for cheaper. Honestly a bacon burger at Sonics with hatch green chiles is a pretty good approximation to their spicy bacon thingy here. That goes for the shakes as well. We shared the fancy fries too. They were good. Just good. There are dozens of places in Vegas that have some sort of signature stacked fries that are just as good if not better (and cheaper).   In conclusion, there are a lot of poke stops nearby. So maybe follow those poke stops to somewhere that gives you more bang for your buck. If your bag gets full, discard some stuff, you're not in enough gym battles to need that many potions and revives. Shake shack, a three-and-a-half at best.",

This one of a kind restaurant offers excellent burgers and a unique fast food dinning experience unlike most traditional fast food joints.   The Shack Stack tops my list of favorite items on the menu. The fried portobello mushroom adds an incredible edge to an already good burger.  I likely won't be able to get myself to try anything else on the menu after having already experienced the Shack Stack. It's too good   The shakes/concretes are not bad. They definitely don't stand out quite like the Shack Stack but taste great with a burger and fries.  Shake Shack's restaurants are excellent places to dine in. Unlike most fast food establishments, SS offers a fun, upbeat atmosphere with up-to-date design features that add to the experience. Unique architecture, modern design and well thought out logistics make things all the better. Large tv's are located throughout the place and Customers are given a vibrating device to let them know when their order is ready - much better than trying to listen for your number to be called.

About halfway through our meal though there were quite a few people finishing up and leaving, freeing up more tables, but they were quickly filling up.  There was also a bit of a line to place your order but it seemed to move very quickly.  For my food, I got the single Shack Burger with bacon.  It was really good!  A bit on the small size though, so if you come really hungry, you might want to get the double.  Got some crinkle cut fries on the side.  It's a generous serving so you might want to split it with someone else.  I had so many fries left over that I just could not finish!  To drink I had their mango lemonade which was just ok, and I had to get a Concrete.  I got their All Shook Up which I enjoyed and definitely recommend.    Great and friendly service, from the person who took my order to the person who took my tray when I was all finished.  Can't go wrong with service and food like that.

They had told me the standards were up to In n Out's, which is pretty high for me because I love that place.   We got to New York New York and made it to Shake Shack, there was a bit of a long line but my friends told me that it was shorter than usual. I looked at their menu and decided to get the Smoke Shack which is their burger with smoked bacon and peppers.  However, I wanted a COMBO but came to realize that they don't give combos and you have to buy everything separate. Well that blows, I ended up paying $15 for a burger and shake only. $3 more if I wanted fries.   So once I got my food, I was kind disappointed. The burger looked a bit sad but it taste okay, and the strawberry shake was probably the best. However, I would still choose In n Out over this any day.   Overrated and over priced.",

I ordered the Shackburger with bacon and some cheese fries.  I know this place is typically compared to In n Out but I feel like they are a different style than that (or maybe I'm biased that In n Out is better).  I liked the burger a lot, it was very flavorful and meaty which is the type of burger I usually enjoy.  I think the best part of this meal were the cheese fries.  They had just the right amount of cheese and definitely a different style than at In n Out.  I really liked them a lot and wish I ordered more.  The burger and the fries filled me up pretty well.  Since this is the only location close to me, I have to give it a 5 stars.  Especially for the drunchies.",

    "text": "it had been almost 7 years since my last Shake Shack meal.  this time around, i realized that it's really in a category of it's own.  it's not fast food, and it's not your full service restaurant.  BUT.  whatever category you put them in, the burgers are exceptional.  meat quality is superior to any fast food joint that exists, perhaps just as good as your 4-5 star rated full service restaurants, and better than many of the plentiful out there.  we ordered a DOUBLE SHACK BURGER, CHICK'N SHACK, FRIES, SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE and JACKPOT CONCRETE, and here's how it rolled:  the DOUBLE SHACKBURGER.  mmmm.  meat was tender, no doubt freshly ground.  crumbled easily at the bite.  so flavorful.  and the cheese.  lusciously melted on the patty.  that bun, eggy and a bite gave all the flavors and textures in the burger.  in other words, i tasted the burger as a whole, and not as a sum of all its parts.  each and every part of its components were synonymous with its bigger self, ie. as being A BURGER.  does that make any sense?  i can't think of any other way to explain it.  it was so naturally melded together, every luscious bite seamlessly glorious.  SO.  DARN.  GOOOOOD.   the CHICK'N SHACK.  so i came in with no expectations.  but this was life-changing amazing.  so crispy, not greasy.  and ahhhh... J-U-U-U-U-I-C-Y.  i was blown away by this chick-a-dee. just perfection all around.  yeah cliche, but it's truth.  sorry...  i just don't think i'll ever want another Chick-fil-Who??  ever again.  YEAH.  THAT GOOD.  and then some.  and some more.  why oh why did hubby and i share??!  FRIES?  yummy.  everyone has their opinion on the fries.  and they compare.  but i like them.  in fact, they're reminiscent of the fries i had as a little girl on those few times mom bought frozen fries from the grocery.  BUT.  yes, these are so much better!  golden crispy outside and fluffy inside.   SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE.  more please!!  i felt like a little girl again with this frozen custard.  Y.U.M.  i could have used an extra strong flavor on the salted caramel, but that's just me.  i like everything to taste stronger when it comes to shakes.  just wished to God they had extended their featured MISO SALTED CARAMEL flavor from the week before!!!  boo hoo... i'll just hope they bring that to LaLaLand.  i will be there.  JACKPOT CONCRETE - yummy, but mine was pretty melted and soft by the time i got to it.  will have to try again next time.  fun and festive flavor though, with the confetti sprinkles and waffle pieces and strawberry puree.    overall, my testbuds had the time of their burger-lovin life.  i would have had dinner here too had it been closer to my hotel.  BUT.  i shall wait until Danny Meyers serves me up some in WeHo or DTLA.. #seeYAsoon #cannotFRIGGINwait #cravingSS #hangry4SSinLA  service was very pleasant, despite the long long 5-deep line.  it was high noon and bustling, but the quality of every item we had was perfect.",

Having arrived here at noon there was a fairly long lone but it moved quickly. After our order was placed we didnt have to wait too long either. Standard cheese burger we ordered was juicy with a thin patty. Came with tomatoes, onion, pickles, their special sauce which was basically like a tangy thousand island without the relish  or aoili style,  not bad. The crinkle cut fries were very crispy and not bad for being crinkle cut fries. Also ordered a root beer milkshake made from their custard which had good consistency and flavor.

I heard a lot of people rave about Shake Shack burgers and know that they line up to get them but, I was really disappointed when I decided to give them a try on my last trip to Vegas. I wanted to keep it simple so I had the \"ShackBurger\". There is absolutely nothing special about it. It's like a much smaller version of something that you would get a family chain restaurant. Bleh.  I can't comment on the fries because I didn't try them. They looked OK but I wanted to try a shake instead. I enjoyed the shake. They had a few more flavors to choose from but I went with the basic chocolate ( 'cause I like to keep it simple). It was on the \"runny\" side but I actually like them when you can get them through a straw right away.   I don't know what it is but maybe people are too caught up in the publicity and say something great about the food to go along with the crowd. I'm pretty sure if you did a blind taste test against some smaller fast food chains these burgers would be at the bottom.  If you like long lines, beer or wine with your fast food or IPOs, this is your place.",

First impression: cool location on the strip, chic decor, fast service.  Second impression:  the food is overpriced and marginal.  The burgers were overcooked and small-ish.  And nearly $6 for a tiny milkshake is absurd.  The fries are nothing special.  I could buy the same thing frozen and Walmart and cook them at home.  The cheese fries just had some nacho cheese stuff squirted over them.    The bill for 2 adults and 3 kids was over $80. I realize this is a location on the Vegas strip, but that is crazy expensive fast food.   I don't understand the hype.  In-N-Out Burger is better value and has, in my not-so-humble opinion, much tastier food.",

Unfortunately, I was recovering from a bout of gastroenteritis (coincidentally, just like when I first tried Shake Shack in New York).  I settle for a simple single Shack Burger and it was just as delicious as the first time.  The patty is a little crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and tastes like real barbeque.  Creamy Shack sauce makes it even more delectable.  It is a little on the pricier side for a fast food burger, but I believe you're paying for a quality product.  My boyfriend seemed to agree- after wolfing down a double SmokeShack, he quickly stood up for seconds- a Shack Burger & chicken dog (!!!)  There was hardly a line on opening day and the staff were super friendly and genuinely excited to serve us.  Maybe they were just well prepared, but hopefully the service stays the same.  Doesn't hurt that they also have their own exclusive beer & wine.  Definitely adding this place to my list of favorite cheap, fast food eats on the Strip along with Secret Pizza & Earl of Sandwich!!",

    "text": "Being generous with that extra star...  So I came here today after some raving reviews from a friend of mine. She likes this place over In-N-Out and it's super delicious blah blah blah.  Came around 2pm to a short line outside and spoke to the usher guy outside who says he eats 4 of these things a day and brings then back home to his wife...so I start thinking...\"how big are these burgers?\". He explains how the menu works and all that good stuff.  Went inside and waited in the second line and looked over the decor...I don't care...It's about the food. Just looked kinda hipster/umami-esq...No big deal.  Ended up getting a single of the one with bacon and peppers while the gf got a single of their claim to fame (sorry I forget the names). I opted for the single because I couldn't get myself to spend 3 extra dollars for a 4oz meat patty. I got the Chicago style hot dog instead to try more of the menu and fries and topped it off with a concrete (kinda like a blizzard from DQ) with the strawberry and waffle pieces. Got a side of fries and bill came to $28 bucks....whoo...that's...a lot.  Got the pager and waited a few...then got the food.   First impressions: looks good. Kinda on the small side burger wise. I little smaller than In-N-Out but bigger patties. Gf has one tomato and one piece of lettuce, mine has a good amount of bacon and peppers. Nice crinkle fries and good looking concrete. Thought a single scoop is pretty small for the price. Chicago dog was Nathan's small but looked the part without the nuclear green relish.  Taste: bacon was good and peppers had little bite. No lettuce or tomato for this...Kinda disappointed. Tasted good but not OMG best thing ever! Bread was like a mix of brioche and hawaiian and was split but not all the way so ended up like a pocket thing. Gf's was good but ordinary. Shack sauce was kinda lacking. Nothing special. The dog was good. Split and grilled. Good condiments but no casing so no \"snap\". The fries are great. Crinkle kept the crunch. Although...for a burger place that tries to exemplify organic and no GMO \"specialty\" burger place, I would have expected real potatoes...not some Sysco or Ore-Ida frozen potatoes for fries. The concrete was good. I liked that. The waffle pieces were crunchy and tasty. The strawberry was good and the ice cream was good. Note I say ice cream...not custard as they advertise. I've had frozen custard...and it had a certain consistency and smoothness and taste...totally different than froyo and ice cream..but this...this was ice cream.  Final thoughts: I'd come here for dessert. I think the burgers are WAY overpriced. $9 for a small double cheese burger is not worth it. You could get gourmet gastro pub type burgers (huge 1/2 or 1/3lb with all kinds of oddball toppings) for that price. They offer no \"combos\" to help out the pricing. Taste was mediocre. And comparing to major competitors, In-N-Out to me has more flavor, but if not even that...give more veggies and for $9 you can have 3 patties, real hand cut fries, and a drink. 5 guys has many toppings, homestyle taste, fresh cut fries, and a drink as well for around the same price.   I was lucky I was in Vegas to try this place out where spending money comes easy. If it had been at home, I'd be very angry.",

    "text": "Shake Shack is here!  Who cares?  I've been to Shack locations in both NY and Philly, and those were leaps and bounds above the experience I had at the new Vegas location.  It was just underwhelming.  Completely underwhelming.  My burger was dripping grease from every spot possible.  I love burgers and I have a tolerance for a certain amount of fat, but the bun shouldn't be soggy before I finish.  And let's talk about that bun.  I dont know what it was but something was just a little off.  There was a little metallic taste to it that was really unpleasant.    Overall, this was just not the same experience I had in the east coast locations.  If this was my only Shake Shack experience ever, I dont think I would go back.  To be fair to the employees, they were amazing.  Everyone was very friendly, helpful, and happy to be there.  Multiple people offered to clean the table and take away our trays / trash.  This service is the only thing saving this review from being a 1-star.",

I would recommend anyone walking along the Las Vegas strip stop by and try the custard.  However, the burgers were a bit of a let down, especially considering the long lines. I've tried a lot of different burger places in this town, and there are plenty of better options. This particular location is near the New York New York hotel and casino, but there are a number of better burger places in that same area.",

    "text": "THANK THE BURGER GODS BECAUSE SHAKE SHACK IS NOW ON THE WEST COAST.  Seriously though Shake Shack was one of my mandatory eats whenever I visited NYC and to have it only a mere 4 hours away from socal instead of a 5 hour plane flight away is AWESOME. I may have jumped up and down with pure glee as I found out they opened at the NY NY in Las Vegas.  Needless to say the flavor and service here is on par with the ones I had in NYC. I ordered my usual shroom burger and cheese fries and was salivating.  The shroom burger is absolutely delicious and full of flavor.  I prefer it over their cheeseburger, but their cheeseburger is also a great option. Their crinkle cut cheese fries were on point with the ones I had in NYC.  For the reviewers that are comparing it to In-N-Out, just don't. For one Shake Shack has a higher price point and is a bit more fancier than In-N-Out, which is a more fast food/grab and go.  Although you can get Shake Shack to go, most people eat it at the restaurant. Shake Shack also serves alcoholic beverages and has a bigger selection in its menu plus a weekly custard flavor.  The only reason people would say Shake Shack is the east coast's version of In-N-Out is because it was exclusive to the east coast like how In-N-Out is exclusive to the west coast.  So if you're a first time visiter to Shake Shack try not to compare it to In-N-Out because it's a different experience. I like both of them equally.  Location is obviously in the New York New York Hotel and Casino.  You can see it from Las Vegas Blvd since there is a huge sign for it and definitely reminds me of their NYC locations.  There is ample seating inside and outside the restaurant.  Service is quick, but the quality is still there.  If you want a good, cheap, on the strip, eat, this is a great place to go to for burgers.",

I was aware of the Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out Burger for awhile but being from North Carolina I was never able to try both. I must say, Shake Shack definitely lived up to expectations. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty laid back, it was packed and seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists. I ordered a standard burger but asked for it well done, which they got perfectly right, even putting a well done sticker it. The burger was delicious, fresh, the toppings were fresh as well and the bun was buttery and complimented the burger nicely. I also got a \"concrete\"which is a custard with two mix ins, chocolate toffee and chocolate truffle cookie dough. Unfortunately, the cashier must've messed it up and instead of truffle cookie dough I had some unidentifiable and not pleasing topping instead. Despite that mix up, the vanilla custard I could taste was absolutely incredible, the best custard I've ever had, so rich and flavorful! I had to return my last night in Vegas for another and this time they did get the order correct and the chocolate truffle cookie dough was to die for! I wish we had Shake Shack in NC!",

I got a single ShackBurger with cheese and a vanilla shake. The patty is thick and was grilled nicely. The beef tasted better than most other fast food burger joints. The bun engineering was impressive. There's a little flap on the back to keep the contents of your burger from falling out. Overall, though, the burger was bland compared to Shake Shack's more established West Coast competitor. The bun and vegetables were a little boring. Fresh ingredients are important but they aren't everything. The seasoning and sauce left something to be desired. The vanilla shake was mediocre. Again, tasted like high quality ingredients were used. The texture was excellent but the flavor was a bit disappointing. I'll try a specialty burger and a malt shake next time.",

This spot is head to head east coast vs west coast in n out many can debate and say but im west coast and this burger is up there; is it better than in n out not gonna say but its def can rival it. Why do i like shake shack, well for starters they have a more flavorful bun, their meat pattys are bigger and more flavorful and all that cheese. Something about this burger also is less greasy than some other places but this is what an all american burger should taste like. Now the fires MmmmMmmm a little crispy nice and add the cheese oh my goodness!! All i can say is im a fan i was a fan when i had it in NY and glad its out here on the west side; sorry in n out but ill be going here more often",

You guys might all wonder, which is better? iN-N-OUt or Shake Shack. Both burgers are made differently, I want to say, they are all a different breed. Each burger stands out differently.  Shake Shack adds their specialty sauce in each of their burger. Also, we can't forget about their amazing fried portobello mushroom with oozing cheese or some sort of sauce after each bite. I like to add red peppers to my burger, it adds a nice tangy- spicy-ness kick to the burger.  Don't forget to add a side of crinkle cut cheese fries! . I suggest sharing, the portion is not big, but it is pretty heavy due to the cheese. Can't wait to go back and try the frozen custard next!",

I opted for the shack stack with the mushroom. Oh em gee. As soon as I chomped down for my first bite I felt all the cheesy gooeyness and I fell pretty much in love. The built in cheese was just pure genius. I have never had a mushroom burger constructed like that before. We went with the cheese fries and now I wish we had went with onion rings or something else. To start I don't like crinkley fries. They remind me of cafeteria food and and cheese was a bit much for me. Unfortunately we were grabbing a late lunch and had plans to eat at bachannal shortly after for dinner so I decided against a milkshake or float. This still makes me a bit sad that I didn't get to experience a purple cow float, whatever that even is.. But it sounds cool and yummy. Perhaps another day. Overall though I still much prefer in-n-out.",

Shake Shack is now my favorite fast food restaurant. The Shack Stack is a complete mouthgasm. The double double from In-N-Out has the better sauce, but the giant fried portobello mushroom with cheese from the Shack Stack is unbeatable. The fries here are crinkled-cut, usually not my favorite, but they're actually well seasoned and crispy. I definitely prefer them over Animal style fries. I need to come back and try their milkshakes.",

It was busy but also very quick to get attended. These burgers were deliciously made. They help together each topping very wellZ The bread was soft and seemed like it was just made. The sauce wasn't too overwhelming it was a mayo/thousand island like feel/taste. The fries were the best, crinkled, well done with a crunch on the outside & soft mashed potatoes on the inside. They complimented the burgers well. Their prices are super good for what it is as well which made my wallet super happy. The overall feel is like Unami, casual but sleek. They had tvs all around to catch current games. It was clean and facilitated well. I enticed my meal here & can't wait to eat again.'l They also have inside & outside seating, even a dog menu!

    "text": "We had stayed in Vegas for New Year's weekend and saw that New York New York had finished remodeling their new strip sidewalk with the new Hershey store and some restaurants including Shake Shack. We've heard of the name before so we wanted to try it out.   Shake Shack just opened before New Year's day so outside there was an introductory line where a guy handed out menus and introduced the items they had to offer. He briefed us on their purpose to use \"all natural premium ingredients\" with no hormones, etc. Briefly looking over the menu we see prices are a bit high than we are used to but it's okay, we're thinking it better be good cause we'd be comparing them to other popular burger joints like Umami Burger and Slater's 50/50.  Service was efficient; we had gotten our food without much wait. The condiments counter was simple with utensils, lids, ketchup/mustard, and water. I wish they had the sport peppers on the counter that they use in their dog, which I'll get to in a bit. Chairs and tables here remind me of Mendocino Farms in L.A.; they're made from recycled and sustainable materials. Everything about this joint reminds me that they're trying to do good for the environment and our health. Hipster, as they call it?  The presentation of the food was cute. Each burger fit in a paper sleeve and hot dog and crinkle cut fries sat in small trays. Having said that, we were disappointed in the size of our meal especially for the price we had paid. It's all quality over quantity here so you gotta give up some of your wins from gambling! However, the taste of the burgers were mediocre. I had the single ShackBurger and my bf had the SmokeShack (yes these are registered trademarks already). The ShackBurger was a simple cheese burger with one leaf of lettuce and one slice of tomato. Pretty minimal that I couldn't even taste the ShackSauce (spread). The SmokeShack was a bit better with cherry peppers but nothing really stood out. Turns out they were originally a hot dog stand in New York so it was a good thing my boyfriend ordered a Shackago dog too. This was pretty good with the toppings placed perfectly in and outside the split dog. The sport peppers was really what gave this dog a kick! We had all three concretes: Shack Attack, Jackpot, and All Shook Up, but nothing was that great about it either. I've had better concretes elsewhere.  For now, I think I'd only go back for their hot dogs which isn't much of a selection; neither is their burger choices. Also I'd like to note that their burgers and fries are good because of the quantity of oil they use. Cheese burgers and cheese fries on top of that? To me, that just sounds unhealthy too. So for being a proponent of eating natural, non-GMO, and all that crap, Shake Shack should consider adding much more veggies and using less oil in their items. Just saying!",

I was in town for an entire week for SEMA and decided to pop into Shake Shack for a quick lunch.  I love a goo burger as much as the next person but this place really disappointed me.  I paid a little under $20 for lousy food.  Literally I had very high expectations but came out more disappointed than anything else.  I ordered the SmokeShack double, cheese fries and a malted black and white shake.  SmokeShack- 2/5, it wasn't good at all.  Super salty burger, only the pepper gives it a nice flare but really nothing special at all.  The meat tasted dry and uneventful.  Cheese Fries- 3/5, it wasn't bad, just very oily, so oily, between two people we ddi not finish them.    Malted Shake (Black and White)- 1/5, this was just bad.  It tasted like blended chocolate milk.  This is probably the worst shake I've ever had at a place known for their 'shakes'.  Very small potion for a very high price as well.  Although this place is very hyped up, when I went there was no line, walked right in, ordered, got my food in 6-7 minutes and left fairly disappointed a few minutes later.  Would I come back?  No.  It's one of those places you try and you see what the hype is for yourself.",

I should not be hungry after eating a double cheeseburger. I was not very impressed with their fries which were the crinkle cut fries with what tasted like a cheap canned cheese sauce. No comparison to In N Out burger. If I came again i'd get the double cheeseburger again and the Shack-cago dog, which with tax would probably set you back $16...",

    "text": "My experience was top notch for a little fast food joint on the outskirts of the strip. With big flashy letters, \"Shake Shack\" can't be missed!! It was cold out and they even had outside seating with warmers! Awesomeeee to just sit and people watch. When you walk in the line seems pretty long but it went by really quick as I caught myself still staring at the menu still when the customer in front of me was waving in my face to let me know a register had opened up. I feel like I didn't even have enough time to decide! Lol. Nonetheless, I ordered the Shack Burger  and my boyfriend got the Smoke Shack. We got a side of crinkle fries, a lemonade, and their featured lemonade which was mango. It cost about $22 which for fast food is a bit on the pricey side, but let me tell YA... It was worth it!!!!! They give you a pager that goes off when your food is ready. We went to find a seat and the interior design was pretty dope. It was as if we were in New York itself. Little park benches and comfy couches. Our food was ready and I was super excited! The burgers weren't as big as I thought they would be, but it was enough to fill us up. The meat was cooked to a tee. It was so tasty, beyond the fact that it only had tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and shack sauce (delish). The fries were yum, golden crinkle cut. And the lemonades were pretty good! You'll definitely see me back again. Gotta try out their shakes and custard! Welcome to Vegas, New York!",

    "text": "This place has some of the best burgers I've had!  I was visiting Vegas with my boyfriend and we were looking for a quick bite to eat. This was our first time here. We walked inside to see these huge menus in front of us and decided on what we were going to get. We got a single shackburger, a single smokeshack, a side of fries, and a jackpot concrete.   The burgers are offered in two different ways: single or double, meaning single or double patties. Not sure if it applied with cheese too, but I assume so.  The shackburger had lettuce, tomato, and their shacksauce. It was a light burger; tasted like a real good cheeseburger though.   The smokeshack burger had bacon and cherry peppers on it, which added nice smokiness and slight heat. The burger was well balanced and had tons of flavor.  The fries were crinkle cut, non-greasy, and crisp.  They also have cheese fries, which I'll have to try.   The jackpot concrete was a rich, frozen vanilla custard mixed with strawberry sauce, sprinkles, and waffle bits. It was creamy, sweet, and delicious.   Overall, what really stood out to me were their egg buns and the patties. I absolutely love egg breads so egg buns on my burger was a huge plus. It provided a bit chewier texture than regular burger buns. The patty was cooked a beautiful medium-well, with a crisp exterior. The patty was most likely pressed down so the outside could sear to add more texture and flavor.   I wish there was one in Colorado because I would be eating this every day!",

We went to Shake Shack for dessert after dinner last night because we were craving some decadent milkshakes.  What better place for some decadent shakes than a place with shake in the name?  We walked up the steps and went through the dessert only line which features a takeout window outside on the patio.  We walked up and received a typical mediocre \"whaddyawant\" fast food greeting.  I ordered my black and white shake and paid my money.  The clerk turned around and grabbed a pre made shake, put it on the counter and said, \"here you go.\"  And just like that - my experience was over.  The shake was ok, but, as expected, it was little melted.  Shake Shack - I expected more, but left disappointed.",

I'm not a huge burger fan by any means, but these are DELICIOUS, especially for the expected quality. (I expected cheaper quality due to the price, speed of service, etc.) I was amazed at how much flavor the burgers had, in addition to the juiciness and seasoning of the patties. The buns are soft and compliment the patties well.   As for the French fries, wow. Outstanding. I honestly don't enjoy crinkle-cut fries usually, but I was blown away by the ones here! I order the cheesy ones, and they have a perfect amount of cheese. Enough to cover your fries, but not in an excessive manner. NOTE: if you don't like cheap cheese, don't order the cheese fries.   I did not order the shakes because the prices for the size were high. Regardless, everything else was great!   The service was shockingly quick both times I went. The first time, I waited in a line of at least 30 people for maybe 10 minutes. I received my food about 15 minutes after ordering.   I recommend this place to tourists, residents, couples on dates, etc. the food is extremely affordable for the most part, and the quality is outstanding.",

Reminds me of in-n-out.  It was drenched in their \"shack sauce\" which tastes like mayo, ketchup, and horseradish.  Not my bag but it was worth a try.  I was surprised to find Roma tomatoes on it.",

We've been wanting to try Shake Shack for awhile now I was super excited to find out that there's one here in Vegas! The food did not disappoint! The burger was delicious, a little too small for me but delicious! I love how the buns are different from other burger places. The fries were pretty bomb as well. I wouldn't say it's better or worse than In N Out burgers because it feels like that's comparing two different things, but both are good! I would love to come back and try their hog dog selection and maybe the shakes as well.",

My go-to here in the Shroom Stack: a beef patty combined with a breaded deep fried portobello & cheese burger.  Its conveniently located on the strip, at where else, but the New York New York hotel. Walking distance from Hakkasan night club and open until 2am of the weekend. This location is HUGE compared to the original in New York. It's spacious and modernly decorated. Service was pleasantly friendly. A server kept coming around asking if I needed more water. Much appreciated after a night out partying!",

    "text": "One of the big topics from big east are about to head over to west. With a recent successful IPO this New York based brand has never been more hyped. Some say its the Tesla of the burgers and the beginning of something huge.   But if you look at their performance so far, they havent been able to geographically grow that fast. But who says they have to hurry?  The fact is that they now enter the sacred land of In N Out, when opening their first joint at the Vegas Strip. And its only the first of several to come, planning to open another in Los Angeles 2016.  The ppl here love In N Out, so the question is if they will abandon it for their new step brother? My predictions are not, but Shake Shack can still be a good burger joint.  When entering this venue you got two options, either a regular line or a C-line, where the C probably stands for Cold and is a faster option for shakes and stuff. The menu gives you quite a few options, and if you have never been, you will probably spend a couple of minutes observing it before deciding. I came here around 2 pm and there were no line to talk about, which i was a pleasant surprise.  Ordered a double shack burger, fries, milkshake and got a buzzer to let me know when it was ready. I really like the convenience with having a buzzer...what i dislike was to pay more than $17 bucks for this!  Burger was really good and it felt like a burger with a lot of love, fries too was over my expectations since i usually dont like the thicker ones. And venue itself was very nicely decorated and gave a clean touch to the meal.  In the end its insistently to compare the two brothers who for the first time stand side-by-side infront of their hungry crowd. But i cant see Shake Shack conquer In N Out in years, until they have wider spread of their venues. But even then, its hard to become a massive burger chain if you dont adjust the pricing. And comparing today its the double for Shake Shack.  Maybe Shake Shack never will be a serious contender and maybe they dont want to. But as a premium burger joint, they do it well, and they manage to present the whole package within that experience!",

The line can get pretty long so expect to wait during peak hours. There's a window outside if you're just ordering drinks but otherwise, you gotta order inside. The workers are very friendly. You order your food, receive a buzzer, and then pick up your food at the counter when your buzzer rings.   Cheese fries. YES. Get it. I got a hamburger with their specialty sauce on the side. YUM. I liked having the sauce on the side because sometimes, sauce can get overwhelming. The quality of their ingredients is mm mm mm! Good! GET THEIR STRAWBERRY LEMONADE AND ROOT BEER! Soooooooo freaking good. And on top of that, FREE REFILLS! The only thing I didn't really like was that they waste cups. They give you a new cup with every refill. Some people may prefer it this way, but I'm pretty sure they go through a gang of cups a day.   They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating can get hot in the summer but they have misters outside (not that it's that helpful when it's 100+ outside). I heard the East Coast locations are way better but hey, I've never had it there and I got nothing to compare it to. Therefore, I'm just sticking with \"This place is BOMB\"",

The line to order was about 8 min long. Not too bad for a Saturday night. We ordered the Shack Burger, Chick N Shack, side of fries, and the vanilla frozen custard. Everything was ready about 10 min after we ordered. I was very happy with our food! The fries were perfectly fried: not overly cooked and not soggy. The burgers were also nice and juicy. The lettuce they use is the real romaine lettuce and not that iceberg lettuce that gives no real crunch. It was SO good! Not to mention, the frozen custard was creamy, thick and not too sweet. I think it was just the perfect amount too to satisfy my sweet tooth. My only problem with our experience here was the bathroom was pretty gross. Toilet paper everywhere and really messy. Need to keep up with the cleanliness of the restrooms! Other than that, we had a fantastic late night dinner here! Plus the prices are pretty reasonable; we had a full meal for $24! Definitely stop by if you're on the New York New York side of the strip!",

Shake Shack wins on presentation and variety and for their shakes Been to this location twice now, and both times I got the portobello mushroom burger. They add a huge piece of fried Portobello on top of your burger patty. There's actually quite a few items on the menu. I actually ordered a hot dog as well the first time I visited. The fries aren't anything special, and the hot dog wasn't really anything special either. The burger is quite good, but again I repeat, In-N-Out has an overall better burger in my opinion. It gets pretty packed inside here, and they're open until 2AM, so you have a lot of time to stop by and eat. I actually landed in Vegas at 11PM and had enough time to get a burger here before heading to my hotel for the night. Yes I would come back here again, because we don't have one in the Bay Area and we have a few In-N-Outs with another one being built in Daly City. If I had to choose between In-N-Out and Shake Shack while in Vegas, I would choose Shake Shack because I get enough In-N-Out back home and need to change up the taste every once in a while.",

I got the Shack Stack the first two times and I got the Chick'n Shack my last time here. I gave it two stars because I was not impressed with the burgers at all. This place is way over hyped.   -1 star for the price. This place is freaking expensive for a tiny burger. I can pay the same amount and a little bit more for a gourmet burger at a restaurant.   -1 star for the presentation. The Chick'n Shack looked like a McChicken from MickeyDs which I can get for $2. I paid $6 for this.   -1 star for the taste. The burger doesn't taste as fresh as it looks on the pictures. The ingredients seems to be lacking.   Overall, this place reminds my friends and I of an up-scaled McDonald. I rather go to McDonald than here haha. I probably won't return next time i'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I went to Shake Shack again! My last time, it was after Cirque du Soleil's O show and this time, it was after their KA show (this is really a coincidence!) The lineup was once again really long! We wanted to eat this before our show but we would be at least 30 minutes late for our show. We started lining up but had to leave the lineup because it wasn't moving fast enough for us to order, wait for our food, eat and run to MGM.   I wanted to order their roadside burger for my family since they haven't been to Shake Shack but I ordered the wrong burger... The Roadside burger was not on their black billboard menu and at that time, I couldn't remember what my boyfriend got, so I tried my best and ordered what seems to be the best burger out of the menu: the smokeshack (Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, ShackSauce). I also ordered the strawberry milkshake and their cheese fries.   Overall, I find the smokeshack a bit too salty for me, it is not as greasy as the roadside burger but I didn't like it much. The bacon was too salty but the patty and sauce was really good. I was surprised to find it a little bit/quite spicy (I must have been blind for not seeing that it contains chopped cherry pepper!) Nevertheless, it was a decent burger but my favorite one is still their roadside burger! Next time, I would try their 'Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce),  their Shack Stack (Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce) or their simply their Shack Burger (Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce), which seems to be the most popular option.  I find their strawberry milkshake to be really average, it tasted like strawberry as expected. I would order their black and white milkshake again but not the strawberry one.  Their cheese fries (Topped with our special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce) was REALLY good! I really like melted cheese (I'm picky with my cheese since I don't like unmelted ones! Yes, the texture makes a big difference). I don't know why but melted cheese taste much better than unmelted cheese, don't you agree? The cheese was really flavorful but not too heavy, and went well with the fries! I would order this again but next time, I would eat this before it colds down (I don't like it when my cheese becomes \"stiff\", I like it when it stretches)!",

    "text": "Well since the last review I can definitely say after the latest back to back Vegas trips that I am a fan for life now and has even left my body with the shakes, but perhaps if it gets bad enough I'll make the trip to LA and get the shack experience there to see if it holds a candle to this gem of the newly further renovated Park area.  I realized that the burger here just didn't cut it for me as stated in the last review and since I have started to try and eat healthier, this go round I gave a try to their chicken shack sandwich and damned if I didn't find my \"go-to\" here.   It thankfully still comes with the soft buttery hamburger buns that I believe are the best around bar none. I even did take a liking to the lettuce and pickle that is rounding out the lower half of the sandwich and the wife can attest to the fact that I don't ever order burgers with greens (I'd like to think it hides the True taste of the beef and cheese). Ha-ha! Speaking of that, I do feel like I'm able to \"overindulge\" a bit with being able to upgrade the sandwich as I incorporated bacon and cheese which I'm sure brought the calorie count of the plain version up considerably (well you only live once). The coup de gras for me was the chicken breast itself. It was consistently massive in size and juicy from beginning to end. I found it to be less batter heavy and it kept a crunchy texture that just sent it to another level of cluckery goodness (if it wasn't so good I'd care about using the word cluckery). =OP  I admit too over the years since this has been put out on the strip it has certainly grown in popularity. Gee that almost sounds like another East Coast chain that has made its way to the West Coast (*cough* Inn N' Out), but with quality food like this being shelled out it will be a contender for quite some time!",

So with this trip to Vegas, I knew I had to stop by and grab a bite to eat. This location was surprisingly pretty big and spacious.   Since I've been on a low carb diet, I wasn't able to enjoy the full shake shack experience. I know, poor me. Anyways, I ordered the smoke shack protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). Well first off, they messed up on my order and gave me a regular burger with the bun. We told them about it and they fixed the order. I ended up getting a burger that was semi-wrapped in lettuce so everytime I took a bite, stuff fell out. It was annoying.   Will I come back? Probably. But after I'm done with this diet.",

Depends which one- the cheese burger or the steak one? Cheese burger is pretty good, steak burger...got a kick of spice that's unexpected. Onto the fries. Crinkle cut. Just like the kind you had in elementary school.   When I went, it was so popular they had a bouncer at the door. Also their vibrating thingies look like tasers.   Best thing: Mary the waitress came around to check up on us, asking if we needed water or napkins. That's unexpected from a chain...5 stars for service!",

Crispy salty crinkle fries with \"cheese\" sauce smother...and they have no calories! I ordered the ShackMeister Dog which is a Vienna frank split down the middle and crisped up on the flat top grill, covered with the same \"cheese\" sauce and crisp onions... My wife tried the ShackBurger and we enjoyed them both.  We could not leave without sampling both of the namesake products and opted for the custard of the week shake...peanut butter banana, which in my opinion was just so-so. With average food, and above average prices I will stick to In-n-out for my burger cravings where available, and Five Guys everywhere else...",

I ended up getting the shack burger. The patty has a nice char to it,and the patty is pretty big so you are not left with an empty bun for your last few bites. The bun is delicious! It's like a dinner roll. The cheese fries were good too. I got the strawberry shake recommended by an employee, and it was good too. Overall, I'd come back for a burger when I'm back in Vegas.",

Maybe the actual New York one tastes better?   Okay, so I got the \"shack stack.\" Try saying that three times as fast as you can, hah, bet you haven't heard that one before! LOL, jk, bet you have! ANYWAYS, the \"shack stack\" is a regular burger with a patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese and the buns, but what makes it a \"shack stack\" is that it comes with a mushroom. Not just any mushroom though, a mushroom stuffed with cheese and breaded with panko all over. This burger is about $10. If I were to get just a mushroom burger or a regular burger, it would be about five or six dollars. I technically paid an extra five or six dollars for the mushroom.  It would have been fine with me if it tasted amazing, but it did not tickle my taste buds the way I hoped. First off, the mushroom was salty. I usually don't think many things are salty, but this, I could tell it was salty. The rest of the burger was good; the meat and the rest of the veggies. The bun was interesting though. It was sweet unlike most places.  Glad I tried Shake Shack, but I don't think I would be coming back for seconds on the burgers. I would like to try their desserts though.",

If you compare the two you will definitely be disappointed because they are completey different type of burgers overall.  In N Out cooks their patties in a different style than Shake Shack making the flavors of the burgers entirely different. The burgers itself are smaller in comparison so minus 1 star for that and the service was average. This location has great seating and the restaurant is clean and beautiful.  I personally enjoyed my shroom burger very much and I enjoyed the taste of the fried portobello meatiness in every bite of my burger. It was juicy and cheese brought everything together. The patty is fresh and not greasy at all however it does takes more than one burger to get full. They even have a peanut butter burger!  Their double down fries were huge, so yummy, and totally hit the spot. Crinkle cut fries for the win!  Shake Shack please come to Northern California!",

The line was super long but they had a lot of employees working and the line ran pretty quick. The prices are reasonable and the burgers, hot dogs and cheesy fries are to die for!! I think we spend about $35 for 2 burgers (1 ShackBurger & 1 Shack Stack), 2 hot dogs (Shack-cago dog), cheesy fries and a drink! Not bad! We definitely left full! I wanted to try one of the shakes or ice cream but I had no room left! We were stuffed.   When my husband went to the fast order window to get a drink refill, he received 2 free chicken sandwich coupons! So nice! I wish I remembered the name of the staff member that gave this to us! Very much appreciated! Because of this, we definitely came back the next day and the food tasted just as good as the day before. Love this place! I wish we had it in KS!",

Too full of liquids but wanting to have a bit of everything, my friend and decided to I split a ShackStack, a single patty cheeseburger with a breadcrumb'ed and fried cheesy portobello mushroom, fries, and a small black and white shake. The burger came with tomatoes and lettuce, and was glistening and juicy and oozing and beautiful. Compared to InNOut, the patties at Shake Shack are larger, and the buns are less toasty. The fries are crinkly cut and crispy, but nothing spectacular. The shake was pretty darned delicious.  If you're looking for greasy American goodness, Shake Shack will definitely hit the spot. Given the huge selection of food available in Vegas, I wouldn't likely revisit, but I would say give it a try if you have never had it.",

    "text": "My love for Shake Shack runs deep. So deep in fact, I'm willing to brave the weekend Vegas crowds on the Strip to get to it. This is blasphemy as a native Californian but for me, it's even better than In N Out. The burgers are juicy, the buns soft and tasty. Their secret sauce is tangy and amazing. Plus, did I mention cheese fries? Yes their delicious fries covered in an ooey gooey cheese sauce. Where do I sign? I like the drink offerings they have too. They have alcohol and they always have some kind of special fruit lemonade.   The builders were smart and knew this place would attract crowds so it's pretty huge. It does get crazy busy though (like line out the door busy) so it's good they opened the park right next door as that added some outdoor seating. They have the queue thing down too. Every time I've been here, even among the crowds, the staff is always super upbeat and friendly. They also get your food our super fast. My favorite is the regular Shackburger and as previously mentioned, Cheese Fries. Their Mango Lemonade is super tasty too as are their Arnold Palmers.   The prices here are more than an In N Out or even a Habit. I don't think the regular Shake Shack's on the East Coast are as pricey, there's just a Vegas markup here. But it's still much more affordable than any of the fancy sit down places and it's a tasty, quick meal for sure.  The key is to go at kind of off times (so not right at noon or 6 o clock). But, it is Vegas so I think it's probably always fairly busy. If you're staying at Monte Carlo or New York New York, you're literally just steps away anyway.   Now if they could just open one in SoCal that's closer than Santa Monica...",

    "text": "When it comes to cheeseburgers, the faster you can get them in your face, the better.  Although the Shake Shack doesn't necessarily qualify as \"fast food\" (it's more appropriately kinda fast, like 5 mph over the speed limit in the middle lane fast), that's the only real issue one might have waiting at Shake Shack for their burger while thinking they're in a fast-food joint.  All their concerns will melt away when they see that Shake Shack whips em' up fresh for your mouth and in a masterful fashion: super hot, greasy and artfully covered in melted American cheese.  I had a SmokeShack burger which had Applewood smoked bacon and ShakeSauce on it. Sinking my teeth into that baby was my favorite vice in a city full of sin.  If you think you won't be satisfied with just the SmokeShack burger -- or any burger for that matter -- you can get a double of any burger on the Shake Shack menu.  Also, their fries are pretty good too, but they only come in one size, which is between a medium and a large... a ledium.  Surprisingly, the chocolate shake wasn't as good as I expected it to be.   You know, with a name like \"Shake Shack\", you expect socks to be blown.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch after a morning sightseeing stroll with friends. Right when you walk in, you receive a menu to look at while you wait in line, which is better than zoning out staring at the large menu board while the line moves and you're still...just staring.  I ordered the Shack Stack, which is a cheese burger with a Shroom burger on top (deep fried portabella mushroom filled with muenster and cheddar cheese) with lettuce, tomato, and its Shacksauce. Plus, an order of crinkle fries.  It wasn't a large (circumference-wise) burger, but it was packed thick. The fried portabella was very good, especially with the two cheeses oozing out. But it ate very, very rich and heavy when you add the flavorful and juicy cheeseburger underneath. For me, I needed a lot of ketchup to balance the burger out. It was still very delicious though! The best part of the burger was the bread because the outside was soft and the inside was very crispy and stayed that way throughout, which is amazing with the sauce on there and the gooey cheese.  Seeing crinkle fries, I was hesitant about it as I automatically see them as those store-bought frozen kind where you throw it in the oven, and the end result is either mushy fries or super hard, dry, and tasteless fries. I'm sure they were frozen once, but these fries were super good! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and very well-seasoned with the right amount of salt.  This place had a more modern feel to it. The seating area was comfortable and spacious. There was a LOT of people just working registers. They literally stood shoulder to shoulder taking customer's orders. There were also a few workers, bussers more like, standing around and waiting to grab your empty tray to take to the trash.  Overall, the burger was more on the heavy side with the cheeses and fried portabella, but it was a delicious burger. Plus, the fries were very good. It's kind of pricey considering it's just a burger joint locating outside on New York, New York Hotel. I think it's a decent once-in-a-while place to eat, but not a must return visit if you're not from here.",

I've worked in hospitality management for 10 years. I've never seen a restaurant do this -nor should they. The outcome was cold fries that were sitting under a lamp for a very long time and soda that was prepared 25 minutes before our order was called so it was watered down from the ice melting. Hell, I didn't even order a soda. I ordered an iced tea! If they're going to force you to wait 25 minutes for EVERY order before yours, at least get it right and make sure it's somewhat fresh. The staff freely admit this is how the ordering system works. Yeah, a more complicated order will take longer. Guess what? When half the staff is standing around bored because they're caught up staging sofas and fries, they should hand the damn food to the customers instead of doing petty side work like pre opening to-go bags. Infuriating.",

    "text": "Omg I've been dying to try Shake Shack after all the hype about it. I agree with others when they say it's not comparable to in n out though. I really liked shake shack as there were more options and the flavors were really good, but as a SoCal resident, I also love in n out.   When I arrived around 2 pm during Labor Day weekend, I saw a long line and I thought that the wait would be forever! Luckily, it moved very fast and we got some seats inside. After you order, you get a buzzer that will let you know when to pick up your food.   Food:  ShackBurger - I actually had this the next day as leftovers but it was still pretty good. I'm just mad that one bite and the tomato or lettuce is gone. It doesn't tear apart very well hahah so I just had to take it in one or two bites.   SmokeShack - I had like two bites of this because it was my bf's but it was so good! Ahh I wanted more...  ShroomBurger - I got this and it was delicious! Even though it was a deep fried panko covered mushroom with cheese and had no meat, I wanted this because it was unique. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. I just wish the cheese was more melted and didn't get cold quickly.   Black n white shake - so this is a vanilla shake with chocolate fudge apparently. It was good. Can't tell if it was special but I liked it.   Overall: really tasty but expensive for the size! I'm not sure if I can justify the price for how small the burger is. I felt like it disappeared so quickly :( I want mooooore. Much better than bobby's burger palace (love watching him on food network but not eating his burger).   -@eatwithkim",

    "text": "When in Vegas, this place is a must visit.  It was my son's birthday when we arrived in Vegas and we asked him what he wanted to have for dinner.  His reply, \"I only want a burger and a milkshake.\" Now, mind you, he's only 11 so a burger and a milkshake doesn't require much thinking so we knew we were in the clear of having to go to Gordon Ramsey's (sp?) Burgr restaurant.  Our first and only thought was to go to Shake Shack.  I had never been and had been planning on going on other trips but simply forgot.  Now that we had the time and it was a special occasion, why not.  We ordered the cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburger, mushroom burger (not the vegetarian one but they do offer the vegetarian option), and of course strawberry and cookies and cream milkshakes and lemonade.  Everything was delicious.  The bacon was so huge it was sticking out of the burger.  The burgers come in medium or well done.  Well done for the kids, Medium for me and the hubby.  It was juicy and delicious and melt in your mouth.  The mushroom burger (actually called the Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce).  The cheese was oozing out of the burger and it just made it that much delicious.  All the flavors came together well and I didn't even need to add anything to it.  The lemonade had the right amount of sour and sweet.  I believe it was freshly made.  Oh and did I forget to mention that the drinks are free refills.  You just need to bring your cup to the counter (you keep the cover and straw) and tell them you want a refill and what you want as the refill and they will do it for you.  Handy, isn't it.  There were tvs all around so you could watch whatever game, news report, etc. you wanted to watch.  The patio area was well misted so you weren't too warm and uncomfortable sitting outside in the heat.  The walls are glass so you could easily see the tv's on the inside of the restaurant.  There are tvs on the outside in the patio area too.  The menu was easy to read.  Specials are listed everywhere so if you forgot, it's at the cashier too.  There are menus there too if you forgot what you were looking at when you looked at the menu on the wall.  There are so many options to choose from.  The prices are reasonable and not empty your pocket only to find lint expensive. We will definitely be back on future vegas trips.",

    "text": "As a native SoCal girl, I was a little skeptical of Shake Shack. I mean, why, In-n-Out is easily the best burger in the NATION. But I followed the hype during my last 3 trips to Sin City and found my way to its sunny outdoors location right outside New York New York.  My first trip in February, I got the classic ShackBurger, which is basically a fancy cheeseburger with fancy pink sauce, their famous ShackSauce. Eh, it was okay. While I thought the yellow-y bun was good, the meat was a little over-cooked and definitely didn't sink into my mouth. The next trip, in June, I decided to go with something a little different, venturing over to their flat-top dogs. (Why is it called that?) I got the ShackMeister Dog (again, with the weird names--In&Out keeps it simple/classic) which has cheese sauce and \"Ale-marinated shallots.\" Whatever those are. For $4, it's a pretty decent size/interesting taste, but it's definitely not a meal. Finished it in four or five bites... so I had to order the cheese fries. Which are basically crinkle-cut fries with melted American cheese on it. Meh, I'd give that trip's meal a solid 6, maybe 7.  But this past weekend's trip, on Halloween--now THAT was a game changer. I wanted to take my boyfriend here because it was his first time in Vegas with me, and I wanted to see what he thought of the infamous East Coast fast food chain. In short: he got the SmokeStack, satisfying his love of bacon, and he LOVED it. Said the bacon made it amazing and he was the best thing he's had. (But he still likes the Habit better.) And i went back to the burger route, this time trying something new and WAY better--the Shack Stack, combining my love of traditional cheeseburgers and mushrooms (not the gross kind)! and I don't know if it was hunger or the long night before or what, but it was HEAVEN. Finally, something that combines all my taste buds with something different and new--a twist on the classic Cheeseburger--and I'm a fan.   Overall, ShakeShack is pretty good. It's a pretty quality burger. And when in Vegas, it's definitely one of those must-go stops because it's the closest one to the West Coast. But hey, I'm from Southern California, so I gotta be loyal.",

I dragged a group of 6 that would probably have rather stayed in our hotel across the street out in 115 degree weather to make the walk for lunch, and couldn't be happier we did!   Very simple menu which makes it easy for a newbie to figure out. The place was PACKED so we did have to scope a table for a bit but managed to get one all together. I'm not entirely sure what the shack sauce is, but I wish I could bottle it up and drink it. The guys got shakes and loved them. One person in our group even commented that it was the best burger they ever had. I just saw online that they brought one to Westchester, OH, so I sure hope that Louisville, KY will be on the list soon!",

I've been here twice and the first time I got a regular shack burger and the second time I got a shack stack. Both times, I felt the burger lacked flavor.

    "text": "We ordered 2 SmokeShacks, a Chick'n Shack and a Jackpot Concrete. I had the Chick'n Shack and it was delicious. I was apprehensive as I do not like fried chicken, but the Shake Shack did an amazing job making the outside crispy and the inside juicy. The buttermilk herb mayo was light and tangy. This was simplicity at its finest.  My friends had the SmokeShacks and loved the sweet pepper and bacon. They said that the flavors went well together. We finally ended our meal with the Jackpot concrete, which was vanilla custard with some chilled crunchy waffle bits. I liked how the waffles were chilled and layered throughout the dessert. This gave the concrete a good texture.  We came at 5 pm and they were packed to the gills. There were absolutely no places to sit inside. I was standing around waiting for a table, where the people were taking their time finishing up. Someone came and took the chairs at the table I was waiting for. How rude.   Not only are the customers here so rude, the staff is rude as well. One lady was loudly indicating that she wanted everyone to leave so she could go home. Also what is up with the buzzer buzzing and the food not being ready? The servers at the food pick up counter told me that my food wasn't ready yet. Well then don't have the buzzer light up. This caused a lot of customers to cluster while waiting for their food. One star has been taken off for the service.  I would definitely come back to another Shake Shack to try their other menu items, due to the high quality. This is so much better than Chick Fil A. However, this specific location needs some serious training in customer service and crowd management.",

For the cheese fries, we were Split 2 and 2 on whether we liked them. We had 4 people and they put all the food on one tray. We ended up getting lots of napkins to lay down because the wrappers on the burgers are quite big enough to comfortably lay it down on the table. The burgers were smaller but they tasted great! I ordered a Shack Attack custard. The custard has great flavor! The only thing that bothered me about the custard what that you had really big chunks of dark chocolate that was really hard to eat cold mixed in with chunks of soft brownies. It was like gambling whether the bite would be soft and creamy or like rock hard. Overall we did enjoy it!",

The mushroom burger was really good too. The cheese in it is opposite of the shack burger. The cheese was very stretchy when I bit into it and was not wet like the shack burger. The mushroom was breaded which complimented the soft bun really well.   The fries were hard on the outside but very meaty when I bit into it. The best crinkle fries I've ever had! All the crinkles fries I've tried had before this were very soft and flimsy so when I first saw that shake shack only serves crinkle fries I was a bit disappointed. But man was I pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite of their fries.   The milkshakes were amazing also! I tried the chocolate and strawberry ones and they were both really good. Not too sweet and very creamy. Love it!   In and Out gets compared to shake shack a lot. And between the two, I like shake shack more. The only thing I wish was different is that the bun was not that soft.   Shake shack please come to San Francisco! My favorite fast food burger joint for sue!",

The cheese is delicious as well. - Crinkle cut fries - get them with cheese on it! - Concretes are solid as well. Be prepared for a quality, delicious burger here.

It's so appropriate that this Shake Shack is located at New York New York hotel & casino.   Located outside on the Strip.    If only there were a Shake Shack in San Francisco.",

It's pretty ridiculous. An amazingly huge and crispy-fried portobello mushroom filled with unbelievably addicting muenster and cheddar cheese. All melted to perfection with tomato and their Shack sauce. It's entirety is crack I tell you, WITH A LASTING IMPRESSION. I had no idea what I was getting into. And compared to In-N-Out, I would much prefer Shake Shack over any burger place at this point. We stayed at Hotel32, so happily took advantage of how close it was. We found ourselves taking fieldtrips from the penthouse to Shake Shack all too often. Also, I really like that they have a huge dessert menu and serve beer and wine.   AH-Mazzing!  Looking forward to our next Vegas trip this weekend!!",

My favorite things about this place: awesome beer selection, chocolate concretes, and that potato bun. Yum!  The Las Vegas restaurant is so much more organized that any other Shake Shack that I've been to. You walk in and there is a line but the great part is that while you are in line you get to look at the wall of a menu (not exaggerating it's legit a wall and its great). Despite the very clear menu, there is also a team member there to answer any questions and direct you to the next available cash register (I want that job). Despite it being crowded every time I have been the food comes out relatively fast and I am always able to find a spot. The only annoying thing is that you have to access the restaurant through the strip and can't go through the New York New York hotel. However, there is one hour free parking at the hotel which was super convenient when I drove through Vegas and saved me $$$.",

We are all creatures of habit, and I grew up eating an In'n'Out double double with grilled onions, so that will always be my \"gold standard\", but Shake Shack definitely puts up a good fight. I got the Smokeshack burger, and it was good. The patty was meaty with good flavor, not overly greasy, but I didn't care much for the cherry peppers, and overall, the entirety of the burger was underwhelming. The burger was also kinda...small? And I could probably make a similar burger myself at home. Bun was nice.   Where Shake Shack has In'n'Out beat are the shakes themselves. I had a vanilla custard float, and it was AWESOME. The custard was creamy and heavenly!! I would come back just to try more shakes/ custard flavors :)  They also offer wine and beer, which is a huge plus.   I love the location, and especially love the outside seating with the view of the strip. There is usually a long line, but it moves quickly.  FYI, new locations coming in 2016.....including West Hollywood!",

    "text": "About as close to the west coast as Shake shack will get for now! So while I was in Vegas of course I had to try the famous shack and compare it to our champ in n out and my favorite (habit burger).   The design of this place can't be beat, it's very modern, super cool and trendy and has plenty of seating.   The fries were solid. I love Crinkle fries, and dont understand why more people serve them. They were not amazing, but they were solid.   I ordered a double hamburger with shack sauce. The shack sauce was great, the bun was fantastic, but the meat was just ok. It was missing something to be honest. This is where habit comes in, to me, habit burgers meat cannot be beat in the fast food world. It makes in n out look terrible. Well shake shack meat was not quite as good as habit, but maybe a step above in n out.   The only thing that would maybe make me bring this 4 star down to a 3, (really my rating of this place is a 3.5) is because of the prices. It is more expensive than both in n out and habit by a lot. It cost me 13 bucks for a burger fries and small fountain drink. Just be prepared! Ether way, it's solid and a must but when in Vegas or NYC!",

We ordered burgers with bacon of course, crinkle fries, a shake for him and a sea salt caramel hot chocolate for me.

Unfortunately we had a late breakfast and were not super hungry for lunch, so we decided to just split a burger since we were determined to try one.  When we arrived around 3:30 on Friday there was nobody in line and the food was ready in less than five minutes. Within 15 minutes of us arriving the line was literally out the door, but it seems like service is very fast here, so I am sure a long line isn't an issue.  We split a single Shackburger with no tomato (my husband despises tomatoes), an order of fries, and a salted vanilla caramel shake. It was good. My husband liked it way more than I did. I liked the flavor, the sauce was tasty, and it was very cheesy. But, I like texture, and this had none. Perhaps the tomato would have added a little bit. Also, the burgers are TINY. We cut it in half and each had about three bites to eat. I did like the fries, and the shake was pretty good.  Hubby says he would drive to LA for another one. If he decides to do that I will tag along, probably get a SmokeShack since it has bacon and hopefully more texture!",

It's quite known for their burgers and shakes obviously but I was so cold that night I didn't want anything. I did enjoy people watching out the windows thou. Lots of hype for this place and you have some people dancing while dining. Pretty interesting experiments. After all, it's Vegas!",

It was juicy and had a nice simple flavor to it. We also enjoyed the 'Shroom burger---something for the non-meat eaters! It was good bout I could not eat the whole thing by myself. It is a bit on the greasy side (it's fried?). Then crinkle cut fries with cheese. I'd order the fries without the cheese since it's just this cheap quality Velveeta-like. We also had the seasonal peppermint chocolate shake. It was okay.  For lunchtime on a Friday, there was a line....but it was pretty quick. Maybe 20 mins to order than another 5-10 mins for food to come out. I wish there was one closer to me because I want a shackburger now.",

Just basic etiquette! Bottom line, staff not friendly and service not good!  We ordered the shack stack, the chicken burger and the cheese fries with bacon. The size of the burgers were smaller than I thought. I thought the meat and chicken were bigger. But they were quite tasty just not as good as I expected form what I see all the pictures on yelp. The cheese fries was good but they don't give you enough cheese sauce to cover the whole fries. Bottom line, worth a try but don't expect too much.",

The ingredients are fresh and made to order. There are always a ton of people in and around the restaurant so seating is hard to find inside. You can download the Shake Shack app and order ahead which I did not have a chance to try out when I was there last. I will be trying it the next time I'm in the area. I got their hamburger which was juicy and good size even though they don't look like it. Their fries are good and lightly salted. Wish you would come to WA Shake Shack!",

I've had the Shake stack and the shack burger, both were great burgers.  I really liked the Crisp-fried Portobello shroom inside the Shake Stake, which gives it that extra flavor. Cheese fries is a must! The price is a bit high, but it's worth it. Wait time WILL be long during lunch hours, so get there a bit earlier",

Let me just weigh in on the great burger war I've seen going on in the reviews... my favorite quick serve burger is from the Habit.  But that doesn't mean I can't love and appreciate another burger.  So just because you enjoy one, you don't have to trash another.  It's not a Sophie's choice here.  It's a burger.  That being said, Shake Shack is friggin delicious.  The line is usually long, but don't let that deter you, it moves quickly.  The server who took my order was super friendly and answered all my newbie questions.  I went with a standard shack burger fries and a drink.  First time, you need to make sure the core menu items can stand up.  After about a 10 minute wait, the order was up.  And yes, it looked as delicious as all the pictures people take.  Is there any better combination than meat and cheese?  Besides Penn and Teller, I think not.  Forget the look, the taste was amazing.  Moist and every single element was bursting with flavor.  Their secret sauce is a nice touch as well.  If I had to compare, I would say it's kind of similar to Smashburger with the overall type of burger it is, yet the flavors are definitely distinct.  I'm glad there isn't a shake shack closer to me... this could become a problem.  A delicious problem.    Honestly, the strip is loaded with burger joints - some casual and others super fancy, but you'll be hardpressed to find a tastier burger.  Can't wait to go back.",

I opted for a chicken sandwich rather than a burger, and it was delivered on a soft bun and packed with flavor.

The calories were through the roof, but it was an excellent way to indulge in a cheat meal.  It's location on the strip provides great convenience for a casual meal.

A tab for a family of four was $51. Shake Shack was super packed on a Sunday night, and Strip walkers found no cool refuge inside. Instead, temperatures inside the restaurant were sweltering. Maybe the A/C was out of order?  SHROOM BURGER ($6.99): A fried portobello mushroom with an overload of melty cheese inside. Comes with lettuce and tomato. The mushroom was kind of chewy at times. 3/5  CHEESE FRIES ($3.99): Crinkle cut fries topped with a thin cheese sauce. I think I'd like the fries better without the cheese sauce. 3.5/5  SHACK ATTACK ($4.59): Chocolate custard goodness with brownie bites thrown in the mix. Delightful. A single serving is more than enough for two people. 4/5  I think if it was cooler inside and the cashier was friendlier, I probably would have given Shake Shack four stars. Their second location in DT Summerlin has much friendlier employees (and A/C!).  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #45",

My always ordered item with my burger & shake. They have seasonal shakes so make sure u try which ever one is in season before they change it. Last time I got the grasshopper (mint chocolate) & the most recent time when I went last week it was coffee. & there shakes do not disappoint... so indulge & make sure u grab ur meal here. great spot for burgers!",

    "text": "First time trying Shake Shack on the Strip. Located right by New York New York. Very spacious/clean interior and has a very appealing design to it as well.  Decided to try a shake burger (cheeseburger), crinkle fries, and a black and white shake. Maybe it's because I chose the wrong thing to order, but the burger itself didn't amaze me at all. It just tasted like a plain ol' cheeseburger, nothing too special about it. The crinkle fries were good dipped in mayo/ketchup. I personally don't like shakes/milkshakes of any kind because I feel they're too heavy, but the shake I got was surprisingly really good and not too sweet. It's easier to drink compared to In N Out shakes.  Nothing here that would keep me coming back. $5-9 for a burger? I'd rather stick to In-N-Out. It's still forever #1 in terms of flavor and price!",

    "text": "This should read 3.5 rather than 4, but I usually round up.  I think this place is definitely more hype than the taste of the burger.  There was nothing impressive about the burger itself. I guess I was just disappointed because all my friends hyped it up so much that when I actually did try it, it was a little underwhelming.  My comrades and I ordered a variety of the burgers including the fried mushroom burger. Which was okay. Nothing to run and tell mom's about.  The French fries were subpar.  I may come back and try the chicken selections which I heard were a little better than the need burgers.  The reason why I'm giving it 3.5 stars is because of the overall experience and vibe. It has a very trendy decor and ambiance. The burgers were okay. But maybe it was a fluke that day. You'll just have to try it out for yourself. But don't get too excited. If it does exceed your expectations, then it was a plus!!",

I swear I'm not 10 years old . But seriously, I've never had a better burger! Consistently crispy with the perfect ratio of cheese stuffed into the portobello. Fries are great, piping hot with the perfect amount of salt and I hate salt so I would know. Their self serving condiment area is wonderful so no one can judge the amount of mayo I take. The purple cow float is great, I've been there with several different people and it's not something everyone seems to love, but I really do.   Opportunities for improvement are the water dispenser at the condiment bar. The water is always lukewarm, which is annoying when you're there in the spring/summer/fall. The bathroom could use more tidying up. It's a small space so filth anywhere doesn't do it any justice. It's always littered with paper towels.   Random FYI - I'm from Chicago where I have a Shake Shack only 20 minutes (out of my way) away but for some reason I never make it out. There's something about the one of the strip that makes me crave it through my entire trip every time I come to Vegas. Hey I'm saving money at least!",

While waiting for our order people keep telling us, in a rude tone, they are working on it.  I never once asked about our order.  We saw one employee working on someone else's to go order (glad it wasn't ours) some French fries spilled as she was putting them in the bag.  They employee picked them up and threw them in the bag with the rest of the stuff.   After she moved the bag, I saw the counter was not clean.  Yuck!!!

Yes, it's not what 99.9% of the people who go there actually order, but my burger-loving friend drags me to burger places and I have to be honest that sometimes these burger places really surprise me with good, honest vegetarian options. Not this time! I went to Shake Shack with him only because they have a portobella mushroom burger on their menu, but it was a big mistake on my part! First, the burger looked like a large slider and not a real, honest meal-size burger. When I picked it up, the bread was soft but I could feel how hard the inside part was. It was fried so hard that it didn't want to give way when I bit down into it, then when I finally bit hard enough to break it with my teeth, the entire portobello collapsed into a paper thin shell. It was tasteless and just plain yucky! As I said, some burger places actually do have good veggie burger options, but this was one was horrible and a waste of money. I also didn't care for what looked like \"frozen Ore-ida fries\", their too sweet for me ketchup, the music that was too loud, or how crowded the place was (yes, it's certainly popular), but the food is the only real reason not to go to this place if you or your friend want a good vegetarian burger option.",

I am from Cali, this is the closest Shake Shack to me that I know of, and I always stop here when I am in Vegas. It is really great and reminds me of New York where I first had it..makes sense considering what hotel it is in...hahaha...anyways I love this place more than In N Out, and for good reason, its delicious. However, it is more expensive so be prepared. Try the shakes they are worth it.",

    "text": "I finally tried shake shack after having opportunities to try it in Texas and New York and passed them. It's not as hyped up as many of my friends tell me it is. It is a little better than In & Out (in the quality) but the price is what makes In & Out slightly better since these burgers are not cheap! But if you're comparing it to the pricey buffets and other restaurants on the strip, this is not a bad place to dine at. You're in vegas, you're on vacation - let it loose and eat fast food burgers!   Friends & I ordered the shackburger, shroom burger, fries and all shook up concrete (frozen custard blend).  The fries were crisp and favored over In & Out's fries. The shroom burger was decent, not mind blowing amazingly good though. The size of these burgers are also a little small too. As for the all shook up custard blend, I wasn't a huge fan of the banana cake but loved the toffee bits.   Line may seem long but service is quite fast.",

If I could give a rating of 3.5, that would be my score for this burger joint.  Compared to In-N-Out's fresh off the grill flavor and fresh veggies, I choose good old In-N-Out.  The cheese crinkle fries were not impressive, shake shack's melted cheese tasted artificial compared to In-N-Out's animal style fries. I did not try the shakes or concrete as its called and custard ice cream though, maybe next time.",

    "text": "I got food poisoning here this past weekend. Based on an article I found regarding food poisoning at NYC Shake Shacks, it's now nationwide. Fever, chills, diarrhea. Thanks for ruining my Vegas trip!   I got a cheese burger, cheese fries, and a concrete. Cheese fries and concrete were shared with my husband, who was fine. But my cheeseburger was only eaten by me. I doubt the quality of the meat truly allows you guys to safely serve it medium rare. That, or your food safety needs to be given a second look. We also got our food last out of our group of 6 despite ordering first and having the smallest order...  On to the food quality and taste--it's just okay. Definitely not worth the price, nor is it worthy of the hype. I could make something better at home with Costco ground beef and ore-ida fries.   I had it in NYC last year and wanted to try it again since I thought maybe my dislike was a fluke. Nope. Reconfirmed my dislike, and I will NEVER BE BACK AGAIN!   Thanks for the memories... Or lack of memories from my husbands 30th birthday weekend since I was stuck in bed or in the bathroom all weekend.",

    "text": "Living on the west coast, I've never heard of Shake Shack before. My cousin told me that New Yorkers pretty much go crazy for these burgers. So we all decided to try it out for the very first time.   We walk in as a group of 4. The lines looked long but they went by pretty fast. I ordered the Shack burger and a chocolate milk shake. The food came out within 10 minutes. When I first saw the burger, it looked like a Mcdonalds cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato. I didn't realize how small the burger was going to be. I literally ate the burger in 4 bites. No lie. I was a bit hung over still so I figured the a single shack burger would be enough. The patty to me seemed pretty flavorful. Our group ordered 2 cheese fries. Big mistake for me. I didn't really enjoy cheese on the fries. I think I was just craving more of the plain fries with ketchup. My chocolate milk shake was okay. I tried the strawberry milkshake too and it was also okay.   Overall, I was not blown away by this place at all. Maybe if I tried the burger where it was born (on the east coast), it would have tasted better. Probably because its in Vegas it was just okay. But then again, based off of what I had, In-N-Out poops on this place. Maybe because I'm a west coaster, but In-N-Out in all aspects is better than this place. Maybe when I go back to vegas I'll give this place another go or i'll just drive a little and get In-N-Out.   PS: TVs everywhere here. Perfect place to watch the games.",

    "text": "Eager to try as this was my first experience at the Shack! Everything inside and out is modern and new so design-wise it looks pretty spectacular.  There almost no line when I came in. There was someone handing out menus but since there was no line I had to think fast! I went with the SmokeShack single burger with peppers and bacon. I also got a side of crinkle fries and their mango lemonade.  This place has so many people in the kitchen. There must've been at least 30 people back doing all kinds of cooking and assembly. As it wasn't too busy I didn't think it was going to take long with all those people but it still took about ten minutes which was a little odd. Not too big of a deal but still worth mentioning. I got my order to-go as the dining room was packed.  The burger, toppings and bun were so delicious! The bun is nice and soft and the bacon was thick and crispy. The sauce and peppers were the perfect combination of flavors to match with the patty. The only thing is that the portion is tiny for the price. It's a $7 burger and its not much bigger than a McDouble at Mickey D's. Still the quality is excellent so that's worth forgiving.  The fried aren't anything to write home about but they were nice and crispy the mango lemonade was good but it was a little too sweet and syrupy.  Overall Shake Shack serves some pretty good food. There are plenty of friendly people behind the counter and the place is nice and clean. If you can overlook the tiny portions (relative to price) I think you'd like it too!",

    "text": "3.5 stars  I have heard for a couple months that they were opening up a Shake Shack in Las Vegas at New York New York.  To my surprise, it had opened and my fiancee and I happened to be in Vegas that week for New Year's.  We weren't sure where it was actually located in the hotel because we tried using the map kiosk at the hotel and it just wasn't working for us.  So we walked outside, because I saw on some pictures posted it had an outside storefront.  So we walked around the outside of hotel, we found it!  I'll save you the trouble of having to walk outside in either the cold or the heat... in the casino walk towards the Swatch store use that exit to go outside.  There is also a casino exit you can use also which is closer.  Apparently, the day were went was opening day!  When we arrived, I was expecting a line out the door.  I have been to the NYC location in Battery Park and we waited in line for 30 mins.  And with it being their opening day the line could have been hitting the street.  We didn't have to wait too long there were in line less than 10 mins before we were able to order.  We ordered a double Shackburger, ShackMeister Dog, Cheese Fries, and a Black and White Shake (chocolate and vanilla).  The whole thing cost over $20.  We were looking for a table to sit, luckily two women were leaving and offered their table.  They give you a buzzer to let you know your food is ready.  The look of everything look almost the same as I remembered from the original but it has been a while since I've had it.  The food had good flavor but was on the salty side for our taste.  Would I call the best burger on the West Coast?  That can be debatable.    On value, I think In-n-Out is better based on what you get for the price.  If you're simple, the flavor maybe too salty for your taste.  I liked the fact there wasn't extra bun with no meat at the end, many time I get that when we eat burgers.  This is a good sign the portions of bun to patty is perfect.  The location is better than the one in Battery Park, reasons being there is inside sitting and you don't have to deal with the NYC pigeons trying to steal your food!  I would want to come here again to try their other burgers and other items on the menu.  This was their opening week so like many other eatery you have to work out some kinks to get it right at a new location.",

I inhaled the burger - it was delicious! The Shack-cago Dog is supposed to mirror Chicago style hot dogs, but there were a bit too many flavors going on for my taste. I thoroughly enjoyed the milkshake though. Strawberry deliciousness.   I give it 5 stars for the wonderful service and their signature burger. I highly recommend for all burger lovers!",

He said the fries were the winner and that I would appreciate the crispness. He also predicted that I would like the bread, claiming it tastes like sweet Asian bread. We were in town for Halloween weekend and decided to walk to New York New York to have lunch at Shake Shack from the Palazzo. Working up the appetite while being 7 months pregnant, we decided to split a burger and fries while I topped the meal off with a shake and the husband ordered a brew. The black and white shake was nothing to write home about. The burger itself reminded me of a cross between Smashburger and Hopdoddy's. The patty is thin with crispy edges. The bread is not your average bun, but it also didn't really stand out to me. Overall, it's the same size as an In and Out burg. Those crinkle cut fries though. Damn. Very crispy. I never knew crinkles could taste this good! Guy's burger place at The Linq are pretty similar- though the difference is you get a mix of different type of fries at his place. Either way... I would come back to give them another try, but my first impression is a double shoulder shrug, sorry.",

We also got a root beer float and salted caramel shake. Everything we got was pretty good and the salted caramel shake was definitely one of a kind. The only thing is, when I was eating my hot dog there was MOLD on it! I quickly told staff and without hesitation they made me a new one, the manager came out and personally apologized. Even though I was grossed out I was amazed by their customer service. They gave me a full refund, a free fry and also a $10 credit for next time. That service was better than any service I've received!",

The order took almost 20 mins mind you other customers received their orders well before me while making orders after me. I was heading to the airport after and while boarding my flight, I realized I was missing two burgers from my order. This shake shack doesn't have their crew in the shape it should be. A disgrace to the Vegas strip and this needs to be recognized. I told the girl that I usually get my to go orders in a box in dallas and she replied \"sorry we aren't Dallas\". . . Although that may be True, she could've done something to compensate for this inconvenience or offered another solution instead of saying \"sorry we aren't Dallas\" I won't be visiting this location in the future and I DON'T RECOMMEND this location to anyone visiting Las Vegas.

Las Vegas built a Shake Shack in New York New York (makes sense), in the new addition of central park area.  I heard that for like 3 weeks after this opened, the lines were similar to NYC's lines but when we were there, the line was not bad at all.  I ordered the Smokestack (burger with cheese, smoked bacon and chopped smoked cherry peppers) and fries.  Everything was delicious.  I feel l like Shake Shack better that In & Out but I'll need to go again to make sure before I rule In & Out uncrowned as best fast food burger. :)  Definitely check this place out!  I will be trying the one in NYC next to make sure quality is standard!",

The line was fairly long and they were getting things out really, really slow.  At least they are reasonably priced.  We got out with a root beer float and a concrete for under $12.    The concrete was the wrong flavor, but with how long the wait and lines are there is no way I'm going to go back and ask for it to be fixed.  It was decent, but I think if it had been the flavor I wanted (and like), it would have been much better.  The root beer float was disappointing.  ~$6 for some root beer and 2 small scoops of ice cream is lame.  My girlfriend wasn't too impressed with it either and ended up tossing it out half full.  Something she never does.  If they could speed things up and deliver the right order they would be worth visiting as they charge somewhat reasonable prices on a lot of things.",

So now that it's in Vegas on the strip at the NY, NY Hotel; it's only right that I become acquainted with this location. So immediately after landing at the airport, we headed for this spot and everything from the entry to the exit was like my dream come True. Shake Shack has the best burgers, fries, and shakes HANDS DOWN!!!! No In&Out, no Fat Burger, no 5 Guys and definitely no mediocre chains can come close or dare compare to the deliciousness served here.  It's completely nuts in this location, the beautifully mastered burgers, fresh hot crinkle cut fries and thick custard shakes can really make my day phenomenal! If I win nothing in Vegas, as long as I eat here; I'm winning! The service at this location is extremely organized and well calculated in wait time. In a mere 5-10 minutes, my burger meal was ready to be indulged.  I'm grateful I don't live close enough to come here daily but when I am around you can rest assure...I will find my way back here.  Yes to everything about this place, I love it all!!!",

I've tried Shake Shack at Grand Central Station in NYC and I'm glad one opened up here in Las Vegas.    These burgers are not \"extravagant\" by any means but they are delicious.  I have tried a few including one on their secret menu.    Starting with the best in my opinion:  Smoke Shack:  A Bacon Cheeseburger with shack sauce [I think it's like mayo/ketchup/mustard/pickle (?)] topped with chopped cherry peppers which give it just an amazing flavor and some heat.  I've also tried their Shack Stack which is one cheese burger and one Shroom Burger between two buns.  The shroom burger is crisp-fried portabello mushroom filled with gooey muenster and cheddar cheese.    Finally, on the secret menu, I've tried the peanut butter and bacon burger.  I've never considered the combination before but apparently it's a thing.  They serve the peanut butter in a side cup here in Vegas to prevent cross contamination they say but I think it's pretty fun that way.  My daughter liked it more than I did.  Dipping your burger in peanut butter sauce was cool to her.  Shake shack also offers a variety of deserts, shakes, hot-dogs, and crinkle cut cheese fries!!   Yummy yummy cheese fries.  No need to say more. =)",

Although it was close to closing time I rushed in and joined the queue which was massive even at this late hour. They moved through the queue quite quickly.   The service is efficient enough if not the most friendly. I had a Double Smokeshack (cheeseburger with all-natural smokes niman ranch bacon, chopped cherry pepper, shacksauce), Fries & Organic Fresh Brewed Iced Tea. The burger itself had great flavours and was delicious but think it was slightly under in cooking (probably due to the mad rush to complete all the orders before closing time) but it was fine for me. It is greasy but at least they package it so you can hold it in the wrapper and it doesn't go everywhere as the longer you take to eat it the sloppier it gets! I really enjoyed the potato buns. The fries were so crunchy and moreish. Iced tea was nice and not sweetened so gave me relief from all the sugary drinks I have had. Will need to come back for a concrete as way too full to even contemplate one that evening.",

    "text": "Very good, but I don't think I'd say it is better than In N Out.  Comparison to other burger chains all comes down to taste.  I mentioned to my dad how much I love the fries at In N Out.  They taste fresh and not as fried.  He said he likes his fries super crispy, so he doesn't like it as much.  What I like about In N Out, he sees as a detriment.  I say this to say that I like In N Out more than Shake Shack, but I think everyone should try both to make their own comparison, because it is not obviously clear that one is better than the other.  I got the cheeseburger with the portabella mushroom on top, cheese fries, and the black and white milkshake.  Don't come here if you are starving.  It is super popular and although the line to pay goes by fast, you'll end up waiting forever for your food.  I didn't feel like the portabella mushroom added anything to the burger.  I can see how it makes a great sandwich on its own, but I wouldn't combine the two.  The cheese fries were delicious.  I loved the cheese.  The fries itself were ok, but again, I love In N Out fries more.  The milkshake was very good.  There is plenty of room to sit and eat.  I chose to sit outside at the bar overlooking people walking the Strip.  Overall, I would definitely suggest trying here once and seeing if this is your thing.  If it was between this and Fatburger, I'd eat here every time.",

    "text": "Had to see what all the hype was about this burger joint. Coming from NY I have to say nice touch at locating themselves within the NY NY hotel and casino. When we got there the line was out the door but even though to was a pretty long line it moved fairly quickly. They had someone manning the door and letting people in as the line inside started to go down. And once we got up to the counter every cash registered was being used and you could see all the people proactively working hard.  The cashier who took my order, Donna, could probably tell I had never been there. She was extremely helpful, friendly and even though there was a super long line behind me she was incredibly friendly and full of smiles. She helped me with my order and i have to admit she started off my experience quite well.   The food itself was pretty good. I tried the shroom burger and it was definitely full of mushrooms. The sauce they put on the burger is very tasty and adds to the burger. We also ordered the bacon burger and it had tons of bacon. They have so many different flavors of shakes. I got a strawberry and it was delicious!!! Not too thick but not too thin..just right.   Only thing that didn't make it a 5 star visit was that there was no place to sit (inside or outside). It was pretty busy so I'm sure that factored into it but trying to savor and enjoy your lunch while cramped up (half sitting/half standing) kinda takes away from the total experience. The way they are set up I guess doesn't really allow for any other way but maybe one day.",

So when I saw that there was one that opened up in Vegas, I was pretty stoked.  I told my boyfriend that we'll go after a few weeks, for them to work out any kinks they may have in the beginning.    So we went the other day (a month after opening).  It's located outside of the New York New York Casino and the entrance is outside so you have to exit the casino to get to it.  We were greeted by someone who gave us a menu to look at while we waited on line to order.  Although the line was long, it moved pretty quickly.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, no bun, cheese fries, single chocolate concrete with strawberry puree and my boyfriend ordered a chocolate milkshake.  We easily got a table and waited for our food.  It came out within 7 minutes and I was ready to dig in.  I was extremely surprised at how non-greasy the burger was.  I had it wrapped in lettuce and usually it gets quite messy but not the Shake Shack burger!  I was really impressed with their Angus meat blend!  So onto the fries... the cheese blend is their own blend and the color looks a little off because it's a little whiteish in certain areas.  But let me tell you, it is a great blend and the fries were nice and crisp!  I usually don't like crinkle cut fries but I will eat SS's any day!  I mean, I couldn't believe how each one was so crispy and I usually don't like crispy fries.  I'm still daydreaming of their fries till this day!  The concrete melted a bit since I didn't want to stand in line again and order dessert after I finished my meal so I had ordered it with the meal... it was pretty good but not something I've been craving... (like the fries)  My boyfriend said his milkshake was very good and he would go back for it.    There's also a couple of employees that goes around cleaning tables, making sure everyone is happy and has everything they need.    Man, I still can't believe that burger hardly had any grease!  I am just blown away!  haha  Going to make another trip soon... need to get my fries craving fixed!",

I ordered the following:  Cheese fries 3/5: I may be biased since I do love fries a lot and the cheese on it made it pretty good. It was nothing special, but just simply cheese on fries. Simplicity at its finest, I guess.  SmokeShack 2/5: I was so disappointed in the volume and quality of the burger! I really thought there would be more to it, but it was quite plain and the bacon didn't add much to it. I honestly prefer In-N-Out over this.  It was worth a try, but I probably won't come back. In-N-Out isn't far, hah.",

They ran out of shirts right before me though. Sadness.   I got the shack stack and I think they took more care packing the shroom with cheese for the opening because it was packed with cheese. It melted out and squirted everywhere. I don't remember that when I got the burger in NY.   The all shook up concrete was good and the fries were better than I remember. The inside was nice and creamy and salted perfectly.  The staff was super nice and the line moved quickly. I had to get in line for another shack stack because 1 didn't cut it for me.   I can't wait to go back.",

I have had plenty burgers to compare their chicken burger and it is easily comparable to the best of them.   The service was good plenty of friendly staff. The system they have going for seating and delivery of the food is great nothing to complain about.  A must is the fries it looks like most people go with just cheese on the fries but they actually come with bacon and chopped up little red peppers. The blend of all those toppings on the fries makes them great don't switch it up.  One of the best things is the concrete, it is rare to come across good frozen custard but this one brought back memories of the first time I tried it.",

My burger was a very small, very greasy burger.  It's not the burger they showed on the tv show from NYC, that is for sure!  The shake was watery and not thick at all and not worth what you they charge.   By far, Smashburger wins hands down.  I hope this is simply a case of fast turnover on the strip being the issue.  I'll try the new one they are building in Scottsdale  and see if it lives up to the hype of the one actually in NYC. (fingers crossed!). French fries were very good but diners can't live on fries alone,lol.",

    "text": "We've had the opportunity of eating at several Shake Shack locations across New York and in Philadelphia, but this location in Vegas certainly stands out.  1. This location is much larger than any we've ever been to. The original Shack Shack in Flatiron is merely a stand in the middle of Madison Square Park. Meanwhile, the Vegas restaurant offers plenty of seating and a large TV that broadcasts ongoing sports games.   2. The lines move quickly.   3. Customer service is unmatched. After placing our order and seeing a customer heartily enjoying her double shack burger, I immediately regretted my decision of getting a single shack burger. We asked one of the staff members, Diana, if there was a remote possibility of upgrading our burger to a double patty. She went above and beyond by heading straight to the kitchen to change our orders at no cost to us - even though we insisted that we were willing to pay extra. After we received our burgers, she followed up with us to verify that our orders came out correctly.   4. The food was consistent. The burgers, fries, and custard were on point, as usual.   Vegas may have a number of burger joints (Holstein's, BurgGR, etc.) but Shake Shack is one of a kind.",

    "text": "I have heard of the Shake Shack once or twice before but didn't really know anything about it. I have heard people compare it to In N Out Burger, and some say it's better, some say it's not (more on this to come). But the best descriptor I heard from a friend is that \"the burger literally melts in your mouth.\" What I can say about that is, it's totally accurate.  I must be honest, when we arrived just before catching a flight home, I was not too happy about the long line. In fact, every time I saw the line, it was long. But the line is long for a reason. I also must admit, I did not wait in line (my wife did) because I had to run across the street to the M&M store for the kids. Therfore, I cannot comment on the friendliness of the staff or the ordering process. What I do know is that upon my return, I was greeted with a mouthwatering burger and tasty fries. And it really did seem to melt in my mouth. So while it compares to the gloriousness of the best burger joint invented (In N Out, for all you non Californians) it was definitely close. It is slightly more expensive than In N Out, which is one of the amazing attributes of the best burger joint. I don't have a Shake Shack near home, so I'll definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in Vegas, or anywhere else I can find one. You should too.  The only negative I can report, which is no fault of the restaurant, but getting dropped off or picked up by Uber or a taxi is impossible without walking a few blocks because of the street laws here in Vegas. So while it took some significant effort to get here and leave every time, it was well worth the trouble.",

We made it for lunch around 1pm on a Thursday and we were starving after our flight. Overall I'd have to give the edge to Shake Shack if you are willing to spend a little bit more, but quality for the price I'd lean towards In-N-Out (I've only been to the Vegas location, so even this might not be True against other locations). Definitely a must if you are in Vegas and craving a burger.  Food - 5/5 We tried their regular shack burger, crinkle cut fries, and of course a shake. The burger was simple, but delicious. The meat was juicy, the tomatoes and lettuce were fresh, and the bun was super soft. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries as they have the extra surface area for more crispy goodness.  Service - 4/5 I was a bit surprised that the line was so short (~5 people). We were basically through the line and ordered within a few minutes. Maybe it was because we were so hungry and impatient that it felt like the food took forever, but the reality was that it came out in a reasonable amount of time.   Ambience - 4/5 This particular location fills up quickly and seats for a big group (more than 4) can be challenging. It did end up getting noisy, but still an overall great spot to come with a small group to eat in.",

I had the ShackBurger( cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and shack sauce) and my boyfriend had the Hot Chick'n Sandwich, I do not like spicy but he enjoyed it very much and they are never disappointing.   Inside the front doors they have a giant menu board so while your waiting in line you can browse through the choices available. They also have a small outdoor patio however in the summer time I do not recommend, it will be way to hot.",

The bf and I ordered a chocolate cookies n cream shake, bacon cheese fries, the chick n shack and smoke shack.   The shake was really good! So creamy and it had the perfect thickness! The fries and chicken sandwich were good too. The smoke shack tasted alright. I know it's like one of their signature items and it has their special shack sauce but it just tasted a little dry to me and just like an average cheeseburger. Would return if Im ever in SoCal again!",

I know my reservation about shake shack had always been the price...I mean $15-17 for a burger, fries and drink is pretty steep....but you will hear 0 complaints from me about that today as my shake shack meal was absolutely FREE :) hahah, still only gets 4 stars because I really don't like the price of food here but it absolutely does not take away from how good I think the burgers are here.   The bun is like a marshmallow.....perfect texture, compliments there beef patty perfectly. Basic toppings such as lettuce and tomato but always tastes so fresh. You can also order beer or wine which is a big plus in my book. The milk shakes are top notch too....i want to try their version of a Chicago hot dog as I love Chicago hot dogs but Chicago themselves don't even sell them for almost $5!  Awesome location right in the heart of the Vegas strip next to the New York New York casino and hotel. Right by the Mgm and Excalibur. They have outdoor seating too which is perfect on a nice day!",

Fresh food, juicy chicken, and the cheese fries were amazing, even my nieces plain cheese burger looked yummy. Place was clean, only thing our cashier seemed in a hurry as we were ordering, there wasn't a line behind us and it was our first visit, but she was a bit in a rush to push us by, the young lady next to her was really sweet and helpful though. Also when our pager went off our food still wasn't ready, I noticed it happened to the 2 people before us also, we waited up at the counter for a while. But besides that, the food won my 5 star rating. I'm sad that this place isnt near my location, I was informed they have a location not as far as vegas from here.",

Well I'm standing in a line of about 40 people and in comes a guy from the Walking Dead. He is pale and sweating profusely even though it was very cool in the store. He fidgets and moans and I know something is wrong. After moving about 10 spaces in 15 minutes I could tell something bad was going to happen.   All of a sudden, he makes a run for the door. I could tell he was in a panic and when he approached the double glass door he unloaded a technicolor yawn. People were shocked at stench of this mans' vomit.  Needless to say, you had 40 people who lost their appetites and walked out to other exit. It is one of those experiences that will prevent me from ever returning to a Shake Shack regardless of how good they may be.",

Just a couple blocks away from our hotel, it was very convenient for us to get to.  From the outside it's a super hip and modern design.  Indoors is a bit crowded but can't help when it's such a hot burger joint!  The wait was a bit long but I was eager to finally say I've tried it.  While waiting in line I decided on the portobello mushroom sandwich and a malt shake.  I've always been a fan of malt shakes and not many places still do malt.  What a treat!  I don't know why I decided to skip the fries but I instantly regretted it after I paid.  So definitely left for the next visit then.  Both the shake and the burger were amazing.  Surely looking forward to another visit, unfortunately it won't be for a while though.  No Shake Shack in Hawaii...  Lots of room for one though! *hint hint*",

We stupidly shared the delish Shroom Burger, fries and a 24 oz. Brooklyn beer.  Why do I say were dumb?  Well, we didn't know for $7.50, the Shroom burger would be so small?  It was freaking good, but not what normal burger size usually is.  Fries were okay.  What did redeem the place is their vanilla custard, a must try.  We tried dessert a separate day and so happy we did.  Found out that local to my area, they will be opening a Shake Shack in Palo Alto.  I'm hoping that the prices will be lower so I can enjoy the cheesy veggie burger that just melts in your mouth.",

I have had their cheeseburger before, and to me there wasn't anything really special about it. It was good, but not the best I've had. However there isn't a shake shack back home, so when in Vegas, we had to stop. Back to what I was saying... The chicken sandwich was amazing! Definitely a top contender, and a must try. The chicken breast used was super juicy and had a good flavor. The breading is their own recipe and they make it there in the restaurant. It was very good and the seasoning was on point. I usually like to add hot sauce to my chicken sandwiches, but it was good without, and I didn't want to take away from the good flavor. (My mouth is watering as I'm just thinking about it) I ordered the cheese fries and I don't think there was anything special about them.  The place was busy, the line was long, but it moved fairly quickly. The prices were average, and the place was pretty large inside with many tables inside and out. If you are in the area and want a quick good bite to eat, check out their chicken sandwich. It won't disappoint.",

So I was really excited when I had the opportunity to come back.  I ordered the same thing but they ended up giving me a roadhouse shack which was a cheeseburger with caramelized onions and bits of bacon, so not the same thing.  I only noticed the mistake after I'd eaten 1/2 that it didn't have strips of Applewood bacon.  I went over to tell the girl at the counter and I told her I didn't expect a new burger since I already ate 1/2 but I wanted her to know that I ordered the smoke shack and was given the roadhouse instead.  I even showed her the receipt.  She told me no worries and gave me the right one and said I could take the old one.  I was surprised!  I mean what great customer service.  There wasn't a long line and the food came out fairly quickly. The staff is friendly and the burgers super yummy.  I recommend the smoke shack with caramelized onions plus cheddar fries. Their shakes are really good too.  I've been to the one in NY by Time Square but I like this one better. If you get a chance I recommend you try this place.  You won't be disappointed.",

The reason for the three star review came as I was eating and decided I needed to get some water to wash down the shakes.  As I grabbed the cups to fill at the water dispenser I noticed every cup came with sediment that really made me think twice about everything I was eating.  The water made me feel like the ice and everything else was not sanitary.  Hopefully the management will take steps to filter the water they are serving the patrons.  Left a bad taste in an otherwise good experience.",

It was probably the best chicken sandwich I've had!! Crunchy fried chicken breast (not dry, fried hard), seasoned well, soft bread, pickles, lettuce & an herb mayo...quite tasty!! Sooo good!",

    "text": "I would like to give them more stars but I just was not impressed. From all the hype that I heard about this place, I was expecting something better. I'm not saying it was bad, it was definitely good, just nothing to write to mom about.  So my wife and I were in Las Vegas for her company's offsite. Luckily, we were staying at New York, New York so Shake Shack was right in front of our hotel. We got in line about 11am, we had just flown in. Line was pretty long despite having a few registers open. The menu was simple, burgers, sides, custards/shakes, and drinks. I decided to order the Smokeshack, cheese fries, and an iced tea. My wife got the original shack burger.  For 2 burgers, 2 fries and a shake and drink, we spent nearly $30. I understand we are in Las Vegas and on the Strip none-the-less but, come on, $30 for burger and fries?  My next complaint although, not specifically Shake Shack's fault, but our seats were \"stolen\" as we were sitting down. The only seats available at the time were, bench seats with small coffee table seats. I placed out stuff down on the seat to tend to my infant daughter and these two women decided to just place their meals on our small table. Basically, pushing us out. Thank you, someone else saw what happened and they were done with their meal and offered their table to us. I know the seating there may seem trendy and fashionable, but knowing the popularity of this place, it would be nice to have more tables and chairs.  When we walked in, i expected that it would be a long wait because the line was pretty long, we waited about 20 mins to order. Then I would say 45-40 mins just to get our meal. That is just a little too long for burger and fries. Especially, since what you are serving is simple. We had enough time to feed my daughter her baby food and finish her milk, before we even got our food.  We finally get our food, The burger was ok, tasted a lot like Wendy's cheeseburgers. The buns were soft and cold, I usually like toasted buns, it gives extra flavor and texture to my burger. Mine came with bacon and hot peppers, which went well with the burger. The bun seemed too soft to hold the contents of my burger, when I got half way through it, the bun had become a flat piece of paper. My biggest complaint would be that the portions were really small. That burger was probably no bigger than a slider. For the amount of money we paid, I would still expect it to be just a little bit bigger. The fries were great, the cheese sauce did not taste like it came out of a can, so I can appreciate that.  I didn't order the shake but my wife did and I tried it, it was not bad, just very rich.  My overall experience wasn't bad. I expected fireworks but i just go a small party popper. I don't know if I would be returning any time, people say the one in actually New York, was way better. I guess I would have to try that if I ever make it to New York. I was hoping for consistency, much like my favorite fast food chain, In-N-Out. I explained to the people who said the NY one was better, but as a company, consistency should match to be called a Shake Shack burger.",

The whole leaf lettuce (instead of shredded iceberg) also made the burger seem slightly higher quality than In-N-Out.  The crispy, crinkled fries are WAY BETTER than In-N-Out.  That said, I find a Double Double just as satisfying as a Shake Shack burger from a taste standpoint, and In-N-Out is much cheaper.  So, at the end of the day, my vote still goes to In-N-Out.",

The burger here is drier since you don't have the In n Out spread to give more moistness in every bite.  The beef patty is a bit more chewier and saltier.  When it comes to choosing favorite, it would have to come down to taste preference.   Right now for me, In n Out comes a bit ahead, but I do like the burger here and I would come back, if not for the burger, then for the strawberry custard shake.  Omg, the shake is sooooo good!

Its unique enough to not be In n Out and its not too fancy to be a Gordon Ramsay burger. Whoever says this place offers a simple burger is wrong. It is definitely something special. No where else in Vegas can you get such an oozy gooey cheesy burger or a giant portobello stuffed with cheese between two buns. They should honestly rename the burger \"cheesy burger\" but whatevs. I also normally don't like crinkle cut fries because they come out soggy but surprisingly the fries here were quite crispy. The coffee shake I got was good but nothing too spectacular. Only downside I can see if the price. Though it is something different, paying such a high price for this burger, at this portion, is not the best. However, I do recommend that everyone try this once. Its definitely something you don't want to miss out on.",

I can't believe my prayers were answered and they opened one in Vegas!! On my most recent visit to Vegas, I just had to pay a visit to the Shake Shack at NY-NY hotel.   I ordered the SmokeShack - single cheeseburger with smoked bacon, chopped cherry peppers, and ShackSauce. I thought the burger was aite... I think the original NY location/version is better. It was enough to curb my craving, but not nearly enough to compare to New York's version unfortunately.   I got their signature fries which were really good - classic golden crisp crinkle cut fries, and a strawberry milkshake which was on point too. Kevin A. was not impressed by Shack Shack Vegas and put it 3rd on his fast food burger list behind Super Duper of SF and In-n-Out (he was especially disappointed they don't have grilled onions on anything).

If it weren't for the manager on duty [Paul], and the way he took care of me after the incident, this review would be ZERO stars, if possible. He refunded me totally and was more than kind.      Ordered a shake, \"smoke shack\", fries and a bottled water- simple enough order.  To keep it short- food was overall OK, and I'm still an In and Out fan- more so now, more than ever, because of places like this.     Here's when it happens...after receiving my order and taking two bites, I realize where is the bacon in this? Is it THAT small?!  Come to find out, it's not there. A simple enough fix- go back and get the right burger. Mistakes happen.   As they apologize, a short, mouthy and unhappy woman comes from the back \"who's this smoke shack burger for?\" As she hands it to the other server to give to me, I hear her say clearly- \"he ate HALF of his burger already.\"- in a disgusted tone. I could have done without this comment. I don't want a free meal- I can pay for my own.  If I wanted 2 burgers I would've bought 2.     Good customer service will do wonders for this place. Bad customer service will do 5x the damage. If you plan to create a large customer base that continuously comes back to this location- Remember- treat everyone nicely and with respect. You'll never know if they're a local.  Keep the manager. Lose the attitudinal back of house.",

I am from Los Angeles and just happened to be in Vegas the day Shake Shack had its grand opening. Of course we stopped by to get our grub on! To my surprise, it wasn't a long wait. We waited maybe only 15 minutes and they gave us samples of their vanilla and chocolate concretes which kept me even more happy and satisfied.   This is by far the largest Shake Shack I have ever been to. Lots of ample seating inside and outside. Heating lamps outside for those chilly winter nights. Decor is super modern and yet comfy. Service was great as usual and food was done super quick. This is a very friendly and efficient staff considering it was grand opening and there are sometimes hiccups. But I saw no hiccups. They were all a machine and happily working.  My fiance and I got the Stack Shack which is my personal favorite. I love the cheesy portabello mushroom with my burger. I also normally get their vanilla shake but this time we changed it up and got their special which was the salted caramel shake. I am so glad we did. This shake was phenomenal and so delicious and creamy! It wasn't too sweet. It was just perfection.  Just as a heads up, Shake Shack is technically not connected to a specific hotel. It is located in between NYNY and Monte Carlo. You can't miss it!  Ahh even as I am writing this, I am craving their shakes. Their shakes are phenomenal. Maybe I need to go back to Vegas again very soon. I am so happy west coast finally has a Shake Shack of its own!",

Hungry, tired and hearing so many amazing things about Shake Shack I dragged the b-day girl with me.   The menu is to the point but damn...all those shakes and malts and stuff looked hella good. But I wanted to focus on the burger first before indulging my sweet tooth and of course, I failed once I got to the counter.   I ordered a single Shake Shack burger just as my starter and asked \"what is the best shake on the menu.\" The cashier offered the black & white...vanilla milk shake with fudge! oohhhh wiii! and yes, I caved in and added it to my order. I was sooo close to getting them cheese fries too.  I have to say, that is a really great tasting burger! Not as sloppy and big as In N Out, but it was fresh and meat was lean and juicy and that cheese melted so beautifully on top of that patty.   The black n white shake was deeee licious! Thick and creamy, the fudge was a nice touch to the vanilla. The fudge wasn't over powering in taste either.   As my first experience, I have to say it was good. I would like to try the actually New York Shake Shack to really say I had the True taste. and maybe not eat at 1am...",

But I was very impressed with my bacon cheese burger dotted with cherry peppers, though I wish I'd had the forethought to ask for it on the side so I can enjoy the cheesy, salty purity of a bacon cheeseburger.  The fries were just a'ight and didn't warrant the extra $1 for the cheesy variety.  But what made this over the top for me was the black and white shake.  Not sure what made it black and white, but it was gooo-ood!    Our wolfpack--which, by the way, when you're in your 40s will consist of your child, your SO and your parents for portable childcare--spent $60.  This was a steal and definitely worth this paltry price tag.  The lines do get a little long but be patient as it moves fast.",

It's outside of New York New york past the bridge so it's not inside the casino. And no you cannot compare this to In n Out, they're just too different! But Shake Shack the burgers feel a little smaller and are definitely a bit more costly. The shakes here are thicker but oh so good. Got the half and half? I'm not sure but chocolate and vanilla mmm. But I'm glad I shared because the shake was pretty rich and heavy.    The Shake Burger was delicious. The ingredients are really fresh and just hits the spot when you're hungry. We came here after a day club and it was definitely a good decision. I also got the cheese fries, these were alright but I'd probably just order regular fries next time, nothing too special about them.",

We ordered a regular cheeseburger, a bacon cheeseburger (I think?), one of those loaded fries, an Arnold Palmer, and a peanut butter shake.  My husband got confused with the shakes and the ice cream choices. So the adorable cashier guy says, \"this is how I interpret it, you can eat it, lick it, or drink it\" while pointing at the different options. It made a lot of sense lol.  The staff were very friendly and nice and the food was yummy as well. The burgers were sadly on the small side though...not really worth the price tag.",

Shake Shack is more of a hipster joint. Most people go there because the food tastes great and there are people like myself that will go there because their meat is humanely raised, 100% angus beef, vegetarian fed, and no hormones or antibiotics.   People are saying that the burgers are over priced compared to In and Out? I just answered why you're paying more. Quality ingredients means more food cost for the restaurant which means more money out of your pocket.  People go to Whole Foods even though their prices are high because they sell food as God intended us to eat. The same goes for Shack Shake. People go there with peace in mind that what they are eating is REAL food and because it tastes great.   If you're concerned about your wallet, then go to In And Out and eat burgers that Monsanto and other GMO corporations want you to eat.   ***I love the hot dogs here***",

    "text": "One of my fave burgers. Period.   The highlight of this Vegas trip was being able to eat at Shake Shack. Located at the New York New York, it's next to Tom Urban (look for the Brooklyn Bridge replica) & across the street from the M&M store.   It was exciting to witness the grand opening, order from excited employees, & meet the CEO (he even graciously took a photo with us) but it comes down to the food for me.   My husband and I ordered the Shack Burger & double Smoke Stack with fries, a shake, and fifty fifty (an Arnold Palmer). I contemplated letting my husband have a bite of my burger but I realized it would be one fewer bite for me so I kept eating.   I was surprised that there weren't more people in line for the grand opening but I trust that people will flock here to the first West Coast location based on its stellar reputation. I will say that the friendly staff (both behind the registers & the ones in suits) on top of the delicious food have made us lifelong Shack Shack customers.   As a Californian, I do prefer Shake Shack to In N Out. I love how soft the bun is, the freshness of the lettuce and tomato, and something I can't put my finger on. This was the first time I finished my food before my husband & I was lamenting when the burger was gone. That said, keep in mind that the regular Shack Burger is on the small size (something I realized when I first tried it in NY).",

    "text": "Finally got to try Shake Shack its first few weeks of being open when it made its way to Las Vegas. Located just outside of New York New York on the strip. I always wondered how their burgers were because being living in California, In N Out is the undisputed champ. I have friends that have been eating it on their trips to NYC and some have said it was better than In N Out. Others disagreed. Finally, it was my turn to taste and judge for myself.  I ordered a ShackStack ($9.49) and a SmokeShack ($6.69). The latter, I split with someone. I also ordered crinkle cut fries ($2.95) and a large strawberry lemonade ($3.50). That ShackStack was pretty tasty. Soft bread, fresh ground beef patty, melted cheese and that breaded shroom burger that oozes cheese once you bite into it. That's good use of portobello. All that with lettuce, tomato and shacksauce are what you get. I thought the bun was maybe a little too soft. The burger had good flavor but the sandwich overall was a little salty. Its not cheap at almost 10 bucks. The SmokeShack was interesting but not my favorite. It's just like the ShackBurger except it has smoked applewood bacon and chopped up cherry peppers. I wasnt a fan of the cherry peppers. I should have read the menu more carefully. Not a fan of spice on my burgers. I probably would have liked it better without that. The fries were good and crispy. Serve your own ketchup. They give you a pager so you can come up to the counter when your order is ready. I also got a onesie ($18) for my friend's newborn.  There was a little bit of a wait but we got there within an hour of them closing so it wasnt too bad. But you still have to wait as everything is cooked to order. Service was ok. You could tell it was the end of the shift on a long Vegas night. Is Shake Shack better than In N Out?? No... in my opinion, I'd still take Baldwin Park's finest any day. Dont get me wrong. I still enjoyed it and I'd have it again. Maybe I'll get a custard or concrete next time. Plenty of seating inside, out front or on the side-garden looking area.",

They are unlike any burger that I have had before. It a combination between the soft bun and juicy beef!  The fries were always crisp and delicious. Overall the food was always hot and fresh.   They are also very aware and helpful with allergies. Someone with me had a peanut allergy and the cashier made sure to let the cooks know to keep our food away from any allergens.

    "text": "Another NYC staple right around my neighborhood!!  Stoked to actually have the first West Coast franchise in Las Vegas instead of elsewhere.  Conveniently situated on Las Vegas Blvd for those who happen to be galavanting around the Strip and in need of some place for a quick meal.  This, however, isn't the case for locals as trying to get here can be such a pain.  Parking alone is a 10-15 minute walk from either New York-New York or Monte Carlo, only to find yourself lining up amongst a large crowd once arriving at the establishment.  At least the queue went by relatively fast so the wait didn't take too long despite of the line being quite lengthy.  Unlike other locations I've gone to, this spot has a C-Line which lets customers buying anything off the menu but food items bypass the regular line.  This serves as an excellent pit stop for frozen custards or even alcoholic beverages while strolling around the area.  Food was just as great as the meal I had in NYC or MIA: seasoned burger patty topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce between pillowy potato bun.  People usually compare the burger from this place to other joints such as In-N-Out and Five Guys, but I have to say, I prefer the ones from here than the latter.  They also serve several beers on tap.  Perhaps my favorite is the ShackMeister which is made just for the company by Brooklyn Brewery.     Overall, Shake Shack is definitely one of the top fast food burger spots in town.  Excellent burgers, superb customer service and awesome ambiance.  I can already see myself being here at least once a week!",

My friend has had Shake Shack in NY and is a fan, so when we decided to go to Vegas, we made sure to make a stop at Shake Shack, which is so appropriately located at New York New York Casino. This is a cute burger and fries place. When we arrived, there was a line of people outside. There was an employee who was minding the door and letting people in as the line inside moved along. She also handed out menus. The line wasn't short but it moved along pretty quickly.   There were several cashiers taking people's orders. My cashier was super friendly. She took my order of the single Shackburger (a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and Shacksauce), the CRINKLE CUT fries, the mango lemonade, and a cup of the vanilla frozen custard. After paying, the cashier handed me one of those buzzer things, that light up and vibrate when your order is ready. My friends and I grabbed a table that was outside. Even though it was like 3 in the afternoon, the place was very busy and all the tables inside were taken. Very popular! Maybe about 8 minutes later, my buzzer went off and I went to go pick up my food, which came on an adorable little silver tray. I love eating cafeteria-style! There is a condiment station with mustard and ketchup, with napkins and straws and such.   The Shackburger was very tasty. The crinkle cut fries were delicious. I love crinkle cut fries - they are just so cute and they remind me of childhood - hot meals in elementary school! The mango lemonade was just okay - it didn't really taste much like mango. Just more like lemonade. The custard was just okay also. I would totally come back here to get another Shackburger, or next time, I'd like to try the 'Shroom Burger, which is a fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese - it's their veggie option. Actually they even have a burger that has both the cheese burger and the 'Shroom burger TOGETHER. So this may actually solve my dilemma of wanting both! And definitely more crinkle cut fries. I may skip the custard next time but maybe a shake. We actually thought about coming back the next day for more Shake Shack, but we were too full from buffet, so that didn't end up happening. Next time!",

I think the lock on the handicap stall is okay.",

Well, the Las Vegas store is three blocks from my hotel, I've been walking around The Strip for about two hours so I decided to give it a try.  Simple big menu and easy to place my order. Post-workout earned a dbl Cheeseburger on Gluten-free bun and fries. It's a bit of a wait, however the expediter presented my meal in less than ten minutes.   The burger was pretty good and the Gluten-free bun tasted like any other. The fries were average at best. I'm guessing 1000 calories was the total investment.   The meal wasn't worth the $18, but I can at least say I had one.",

The ordering process, was easy. The staff was very nice. It was, on the expensive side LOL! But that is to he expected in Vegas. The burger was awesome (soft bun)hand pressed burger, crinkle fries were good, and the cheese sauce for the fries was just okay. The vanilla shake was delicious! The restaurant was clean, the outside seating was nice as well. I liked my experience and the food. I will certainly visit again, the next time I'm in town.",

I would choose this over In and Out anyway and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I get a lot of crap from my friends and family for saying this but it is what it is!   Although I enjoyed that burger at the moment, I felt really sick afterwards...2 beef patties with bacon was just too much especially being hungover and walking in 100+ degrees weather.  Also who goes here and doesn't get a shake?! Me, that's who. I'm still mad that I didn't get one but again, I was hung over. Maybe when the lines and hype die down here in Seattle, I can finally go and try a shake or two!",

I love cheese so the cheesy shroom is my fave, the bun bread is great, and the meat patty is delicious too. I also got the cookies and cream shake which was perfect! Not overwhelmed with cookies and perfect consistency--not too thick to slurp through the straw but not watery or melty. Definitely top tier for fast food for me.    The space itself is right on the strip by New York New York with lots of dining space. All thumbs up for shake shack!!",

The patty was hand made, which I wasn't expextin. It was a little pink full of flavor and juicy. I have to say, these burgers are above most other fast food places.

Though it's technically at the New York, New York hotel, it's on the outside facing the strip with no access from the casino itself. We had to finally ask directions after taking a few victory laps inside.  The restaurant is everything you've come to love about Shake Shack. I was feeling gluttonous, so went with the double Shack Burger with a side of cheese fries. The bun is super fluffy and the condiments, juicy patties and melted cheese make way for a mouthful of deliciousness... especially after throwing back a few cocktails. This location has a variety of beers on tap for your consumption as well.  There wasn't much of a line when we went, but heard you can be in for a wait when it's peak tourist season. I'll for sure make my way back here when I have a hankering for a burger while staggering around the Strip!",

I loved the location, as it was smack dab on the strip of Las Vegas and on our way to discovering all the great shops/restaurants in that area.  Price wise, In-n-Out still beats Shake Shack. Taste wise, Shack Shake wins out. I got the basic cheeseburger and it was delicious - the burger to bun ratio was perfect, and the condiments on top were fresh. The crinkle cut fries (which you have to purchase separately) were the right kind of texture: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! They have their own ale brewed by Sin City brewing, and it had a good balance of hops and tastiness. My husband got a beer milkshake, which sounded questionable but actually turned out rather tasty!  Overall, our first Shake Shack experience was a successful one. We will be back soon!",

French fries were also well above average. Nice, clean, new and modern location with great service. Only reason it didn't get a 5 star review is because of the price, $13 for a cheeseburger combo.",

The uniqueness and excellent cook on the burger are unmatched and incomparable to In n Out.   In terms of this particular location, I was actually surprised to see how efficient the staff were. Six registers to take orders and food actually seemed to come out faster than I recall at any of the NY locations I have been to.

Now these can be different things; for example, In n Out is a cheaper option, and it isn't supposed to compete with Shake Shack or Five Guys.   But give me a smoke shack (single) any day of the week; that's my go-to!   The Vegas Location (near New York and MGM Grand Casinos) was another solid choice for a quick bite. I am always impressed that, to date, even with the expansion of Shake Shack they have kept up the quality control.

As far as the burger wars go, the best value is hands down In n Out; however, if you want to treat yourself and want something next level, go to Shake Shack. *All Shake Shacks are not created equal and I completely understand that some locations are not that good.  Shake Shack is my favorite chain restaurant burger, and top 3 chicken sandwich (my favorite chicken sandwich of all time was in Portland, OR, at a truck and it is no longer in business. So Sad. I Digress).   My go to order is: Double Shack Burger, Protein Style, Sauce on the side - What really stands out to me in this burger is the savory-meat flavor from the patty. Seems stupid and simple but some burgers I eat just leave me saying, \"needs salt\". It's such a small thing, but so essential to a quality burger.  Chicken Shack, Protein Style. - The key to the chicken sandwich is the breading (or breadin' depending what part of the country your from) and not overcooking the chicken. I think shake shack nails both aspects of the chicken sandwich.   ***I completely understand that people have their personal bias and acknowledge that all other burger chains have legitimate arguments for why they MIGHT, be better.",

    "text": "The burger debate between coasts has never been more divisive. In-n-out....Shake Shack...which one is better?  After finally get a chance to try shake shack, I cannot say which is better, but admit that both of these establishments churn out top tier burgers.  We went for lunch on a Saturday before heading back home and there was no line! I ordered 2 single smokeshacks, crinkle fries, and the black sesame shake (new flavor!).  After a (very) short wait, we got our food and I couldn't be more confused on which place is better.  The burger was delicious and the bacon and bell peppers were welcome flavors.  The fries were crispy and salty while the black sesame shake had JUST the right amount of sesame flavor without being overwhelming.  I definitely will return in hopes of settling the debate in my head!",

The burgers were awesome and good, but rather have Inn-n-out to be honest for a cheaper price.  It does get crowded too, but the wait is not too bad.

This place had great prices, funny staff and lots of seating options outside which we enjoyed. Plenty to see around here too for people watching which kept us laughing for a good amount of time. We were a group of 8 and at one point thought we would split up and try some other places to eat along the strip. Ya - we all ended up running into each other back at the shack, that's how yummy it is! If ever back in Vegas this will definitely be a MUST!",

SHAKE SHACK!? I was so excited. I might have scared my friends.   For now I have to give Shake Shack a 4 star.   I really have to try a burger with a double patty.   I had the Shake Stack for my first time, which is their cheeseburger with their stuffed mushroom. I do have to say that shake shack incorporates a mushroom in a burger better than anywhere else I've tried. Sauteed mushrooms don't compare to a fried stuffed Portobello.   I just want a bit more beef in my burger so maybe next time I'll get a double beef patty Shake Stack  The milk shakes are ok, 5$ is kinda expensive but I like the many options for flavors. Tried chocolate with peanut butter and wished they put more chocolate than peanut butter.   I would take Shake Shack over Earls any day of the week.",

Crinkle cut fries were good, and the cheese fries were a little too cheesy. The cheese kind of tasted like scrambled eggs. Overall the red peppers in the bacon burger was different and I appreciate signature burgers! If I come back I'd get maybe the basic burger (shack burger) and ask for the double.  The shake was good.

Definitely didn't know there was hot piping cheese in the inside of the deep fried mushroom patty. Guess we didn't look at the menu close enough.

    "text": "East Coast vs the West Coast, Bad Boy vs Death Row, Shake Shack vs In n Out Burger.  I'm sorry, even though I grew up here in California and around the venerable In n Out Burger, I would tip my hat off to Shake Shack, the definitive winner (IMO) between the two rivals.  My first encounter of Shake Shack was when my sister-in-law visited us form Delaware. A connecting flight through New York she gave us a bag full of Shake Shack burgers. Upon first bite, I was scratching my head and was thinking: \"how the heck does this burger still taste hella good after being in a bag for at least 8 hours?\" That is when I researched and learned the wildfire growth of Shake Shack in the Eask Coast.   Well finally, we have a change to try Shake Shack; freshly made. They have a location at New York New York at Las Vegas so we just had to try it out. Of course, I tried out their SmokeShack, cheeseburger topped with bacon. I just had their regular crinkle cut fires to accompany my sandwich as I am focused on their burger.   My prediction is confirmed form my previous encounter: a very delicious burger with an equally delicious bun. The only word I can describe their bun is Artisan. And the beef, mmm. The beef patty is so delicious, Prime grade beef is what I could only think off when I taste Shake Shack's beef patty; that and a generous portion of fat. Just so delicious. And still I chose the wrong burger.  The rest of my family ordered different Shake Shack burgers. The Stack Shack (IMO) is their flagship burger. Coupled with a large whole Portobello mushroom, (a different new approach to mushroom btw) Stack Shack is creme de la creme.   With objectivity still present, Shake Shacks' fries were alright and In n Out's is better. My daughter ordered their cheese fries and it was mediocre. But I have not yet scratched the surface of Shake Shak's menu: Custards, Chickens, Hot Dogs, and a multitude of drinks. But as far as I know Shake Shack is the king of fast casual burgers.   When will you open here in the Bay Area?!!",

By far, much pleasanter dining ambiance compared to sterile refridgerated chains.  Primo atmosphere, primo venue.  The double-S serves a very tasty burger:  fluffy soft bun, patty that tastes like really beefy proper ground beef, and all the basic toppings of tomato onions pickle and green leaf lettuce.  I devour it sans condiment.  Yeah, pass on sauce.. inevitably some version of thousand island.  Because when beef is as quality as this, no need to mask it with sauce.  Price point for a standard burger is somewhere between In-n-Out's and Five Guys's.  Don't like burgers?  No worries.  You can get chicken, hot dogs, mushrooms, krinkle-kut fries, frozen custard, milk-shakes... plenty of variety on the menu.  Extra star for easy-to-find location right smack at street level.  No hunting high and low, wending your way through casino mazes.  Shake Shack sports a massive neon sign on New York New York casino.  Practically impossible to miss.  Plus, they are finally FINALLY shaking things up on the burger front lines in California.  WeHo, dtLA and Glendale are scheduled to get their very own Shake Shacks over the next twelve months.  Now what burger-obsessed Angeleno can complain about that?",

    "text": "Ummmm. I don't know what to say really. The burger was good. It was really good. But east versus west coast. My loyalty stays with in-n-out.   But back to this place. Was super excited to check it out. I'm well aware of the hype and tried to make it here for a couple trips to Vegas. I walked over from cosmopolitan.  It was about a 15 min walk cutting thru some other hotels. The street may have been quicker, it was cold outside. I opted for secondhand cigarette smoke. I was thrown off by their burger logo outside.  The signage is all green. Then you walk in and see the signage inside features the green burger.  I waited in the quickly moving line but with anxiety. When it was my turn to order I had to ask, \"are the burgers green?\"  I got a look back like I was being a smart-ass, but it was a legit concern in my mind.   Back to the review. I ordered a cheeseburger , fries and a soda.  There were other options, but that's what I was feeling.  The wait was standard, 5 min'ish. The fries are crinkled fries. Reminded me of the frozen type mom would buy from grocery store.  Not a big deal to me as I'm not a big fry-guy any ways. The burger was really good. Had little tomatoes on them and some type of secret sauce.  It reminded me (taste and texture) of a Wendy's burger, but several notches higher in quality.    It was a really good burger.  In and out is better, but this place is a lot quicker than any in-and-out.",

What we typically do is my wife waits in line to place the order, and I wait around until a table frees up inside. Much like how I find parking in Vegas sometimes. There is outdoor seating as well. I have had the ShackBurger and hamburger. The meat is cooked perfectly and is juicy. As for the drink, you can't go wrong with the ShackMeister Ale. For dessert, coffee shake. There is a public restroom you can use. If you are craving for a good burger for the good value, this is the place to go!",

There is another burger place just down the street, maybe half a Las Vegas block.  It was empty.  The reason, everyone was at Shake Shack.

Plus, it's a great spot to people watch hehe.   I got their classic Hamburger! Make sure you let them know if you want the ShackSauce (yas), lettuce, tomato, pickle or onion. If not, your hamburger will be very naked. :( The burgers can be small for some, but still delicious nonetheless! Of course, you need some fries Crinkle Cut Fries on the side. You can get either fries or the Cheese Fries which is topped with special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. And if you still got room, why not grab a shake! They taste especially great during the day.   If you're craving a burger before heading out for a crazy night of fun, stop by Shake Shack! :)",

I really did enjoy the chicken sandwich, but the reason for 3 stars is because the chicken to bread bun ratio was not OK. The chicken was smaller than the bun and I had to tear off the excess. Just being honest because for a $13 meal, I want a chicken breast the size of the bun.",

You order your food, grab the buzzer and find a seat.  The only problem about this place is there is such a high demand for these delicious burgers but there are hardly any seats since the place is always so packed.  Luckily, I was scoping out the place and found some seats right outside of the restaurant down the stairs so we were in the warm sun!  I wasn't too hungry so my friend and I shared the chicken sandwich, which was very crispy, juicy, and tender.  Lots of good flavor.  I also tried a bite of the shake stack and it was delicious but I can never compare to In n Out.  They will always be my number one.  Im glad they opened one up in LA so I don't have to drive 4 hours to get the burgers!  The fries were also delicious!  Ask for their sauce and dip away!!",

One win Shake Shack owns is a pretty decent beer selection. The ShackMeister Ale is actually a pretty legit amber brewski that pairs well with the burgers and fries. I appreciate the fresh lettuce and tomato on the namesake burger but the patty, while legit in its own right, is slightly less juicy than its Californian comparison. Still an overall decent burger though. Can't say the same about the fries unfortunately. This is where In-N-Out's fresh cut fries win.   The service is quick and efficient and you'll be in and out in a relative jiffy. It could add up once you add lots of extras which can get you more elsewhere in Vegas but otherwise an all up decent fast-casual meal.",

The food wasn't ready until about 10 minutes after the scheduled time and even then, they had forgotten my shake, which added another 3-4 minutes. It seems like there is a disconnect between the mobile app ordering process and the staff. They asked me where my buzzer was and I explained I had a mobile order and they looked at me like I was an alien.   When I did get my food, it was glorious as always! I got the double shack burger and Cinnamon Dulce de Leche shake and it was as if the angels from above had prepared it special just for me.

We tried the fries \"all the way\", which are crinkle cut topped with cheese, bacon bits, and red peppers and it was rather underwhelming. Not enough cheese and too much chopped red peppers, and the fries should be crispier.   Of the burger chains I've tried so far, I like Shake Shack's burger more than 5 Guys. It is very different from In n Out, so I really can't say which of those two are better. Can't remember the burgers I've had at Habit Burger, so it might be a combo of: it's been too long since I had Habit Burger and they were too unremarkable to remain in memory.",

I was lucky enough to get a taste of my friend's strawberry shake and it was creamy and not overly thick.   The burgers are a bit small for the price and unless you're getting the Shack Stack with the fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese, I can't see how you can get full from the regular burgers. What's great about the burgers is that the bun is closed off on one end sort of like a hot dog bun so your ingredients do not fall out. But for almost $10 for my burger, it is definitely not anything to compare with its \"rival\" In N Out in the West Coast vs East Coast debate. In terms of burgers, In N Out wins in my book both for time, price, and taste.  Fries-wise, Shake Shack has the better fries with its crinkle-cut fries and its option of cheese fries which should be a thing across all fast food burger shops.  As for shakes, I also go with Shake Shack just because In N Out shakes are always too thick for me so it's nearly impossible to drink through it without having to use a spoon or wait for it to melt. Shake Shack also have a lot more options in flavors in shakes.",

The Shack sauce was tasty.  A bit pricey compare to other burger places but I chalk it up to using grass fed beef. The french fries were just a bit average...I did like that they were crinkle cut. Being that I went to the location in Las Vegas on The Strip... it was pretty crowed and hard to find a table for my family. I basically had to stalk another family that looked like they were almost done. Staff was quite friendly and the establishment was clean. They have a big screen and plenty of t.v.'s if you wanted to catch a game and have a burger.",

    "text": "I do not get the hype here? Being a NYC person who now resides in San Diego I have had a taste of both Coasts fast food.  This is a place that is hyped up by people who I can only guess are making a McDonalds comparison. Habit and In and Out are just as good if not better. Actually Habit has more offerings and seams fresher.  Fried hot dogs for $4? Gray Papaya in NYC 2 for $2 and blow these away. I had their loaded hot dog and you could barely eat it as it was so soggy after the first bite the toppings were on my plate. Was it tasty? I guess but again nothing ground breaking here. It was a simple hot dog.  It was fairly low cost for Vegas but there is no way I would go out of my way to find this place anywhere else.  Hambergers? Nothing special here at all not even the toppings. Bacon and cheese? Wendy's has had that for 20 years  Hot dogs? I guess creating a creative name like \"Flat Top\" let's you charge $4 for it. Nothing more then a hot dog.   Fries? Remember those crinkle fries your Mom used to make instead of getting you the ones you wanted from McDonalds? Well here you have them.  Concrete? A poor replica of a Blizzard from DQ at 2xs the price.  People before you make claims about something being the best out there actually get out in the world and do some real world tasting.   This is for the 20 something with their new overgrown beard who hasn't a clue what good food is. I get the feeling this place was developed in a boardroom by the same bearded group and has nothing to do with actually providing the \"Best Burger\".   Good deal in Vegas but then again burgers cost $17 at other stores.",

    "text": "What's with all the hype?  I watch a lot of CNBC. And within that context, I have been hearing a lot about Shake Shack in recent months. The hype got me curious--but I am not going to travel from CA to the East Coast for a hamburger.  So while in Las Vegas, I made a deliberate trip to the Shake Shack location on The Strip, on the New York New York casino property.  I visited on a Saturday night at about 11:00pm. The place was packed - not a surprise. The kitchen staff was active, and they had staff to constantly clean the dining room to accommodate the turnover of patrons.  The decor was very nice: modern, bright, and very inviting. This location had a both indoor and outdoor seating. There is a patio misting system to cool the outdoor dining area.  Since I knew nothing of this chain, I stuck to the basics:  I ordered a Double Shack Burger with cheese; \"standard fries\", and a vanilla milk shake.  The vanilla shake:  It was a very good vanilla milk shake. I cannot say that it is the best I have ever had, but it was not poor, and definitely better than mediocre.  The French fries:  Their offering of French fries is the \"crinkle cut\" variety. When served, the French fries were hotter than warm--but not \"piping\" hot. I was surprised. Based on the rate at which the kitchen was turning out orders, I would have thought that the fries would have been \"freshly hot\". They were warm and flaky on the inside, with just a slight \"crunch\" to the surface. I was not disappointed--but not impressed either.  The \"Shack Burger\":  I am sure that they have some story about their hamburger bun. The first thing that I noticed was that the upper and lower halves were conjoined, like a clam shell. The standard double burger had two patties, cheese, lettuce and tomato, along with their signature sauce. The hamburger was nice and hot--surprising, since the fries were not. The beef was juicy and flavorful.  All in all, it is a very good hamburger.    But while eating the Shack Burger, the flavor palate reminded me of another burger I have eaten. Then it struck me:  the Shack Burger's tastes a lot like an \"In-and-Out\" burger. The flavors of the Shack Burger are a bit lighter, not as strong, but the resemblance is there.  The total bill for my meal was a little over $17.00. (If I wanted the same combo at In-and-Out, the cost for my meal would have been about $7.00.)   All said, it is a good hamburger. This location is very nice if you are already on The Strip, and are seeking eating options. I just don't understand what all the hype is about this chain.",

When a girl comes in with a burger and shake and some cheese fries in yo face get sprung, cuz you know that burger was stuffed    Shake shack wasn't around in 1993, but if so I would guess that the lyrics to his most famous song would go something like that. Now even though I have traveled to New York, I rep west coast like and had never eaten shake shack until this location opened and I truly understood that shake shack vs in n out was the burger version of 2pac vs biggie except this beef is a lot more delicious. Shake shack made sure to come correct, the venue is on the outside of NYNY, sleek design and I randomly like that they used old bowling lines for tables. There's two windows to order from. One is a quickie for drinks, shakes and swag and the Other is for food. There's the shack burger which is cool, but essentially just a cheeseburger, but what really had me speaking like ODB was the smokeshack. Take a cheeseburger, make it double, throw bacon, peppers and shack sauce and you have my attention. I could serenade that burger 24/7/365. That's the kind of burger that makes you call your significant other and tell them you ain't never coming home. I tried two of the beef hot dogs an I wasn't impressed to say the least.The crinkle fries are good, but the cheese fries are incredibly overhyped. Like Magna Carta overhyped. I much preferred regular fries dipped is shack sauce I also tried out the shake, and while it's good, it's not Better than in n out, but it's almost double the price. Which is quite possibly my only gripe with this place. A double smoke shack, fries and a shake is about $20, a meal I can get from in n out for less than $8. I'm not sure how much of that is shake shack and how much of that is the fact that it's on the strip, but you get what you pay for and tha shack is quality yo.   So to paraphrase sir mix a lot again: Ladies if the bun is round, and you want a double patty showdown Dial 1-900-CHZBURGR and kick them nasty thoughts Baby I'll be back",

The shack sauce is somewhat of an aioli and I LOVE aioli. If you're feeling frisky, get the shack stack. It's the shroom burger WITH a patty. Umm yes please! Also get a side of their cheese fries. I'm a sucker for the gooey cheese. I got the creamsicle as well. Orange soda float. Tickled my taste buds back to the third grade. I can't wait till they open the one in Los Angeles!",

Best thing ever, as she couldn't have fries. Had the stack burger, it is a cheeseburger with a breaded portobello mushroom in the burger. It was very flavorful and delicious. The crinkle fries were great as an added bonus to it. I definitely prefer Shake shack over In and Out and the Habit.

You can make the same quality of fries by going to the grocery store and buy the cheap thick fries and fry them at home yourself. You'd pay the same price or less for a bigger quantity, too.  And the cheese they use on the fries was so artificial, one fry from my friend's plate was enough for me.  I thought the shake would stand out in taste, but I was wrong.  It tasted like melted ice cream.  Nothing special.   What a waste of money and calories. I should've listened to my sister... I spent $36 on 2 strawberry shakes, 1 regular and 1 cheese fries, and 2 special Octoberfest burgers (super greasy burger that came with a patty and a sausage).",

So of course, I like to think this is the grand medium of Vegas food greatness at a (somewhat) reasonable price.  Burgers? Don't have shake shack at your local town? Shack Stack allll the way. Cheese burger with a FRIED PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM WITTH CHESSE. And that stuff oozessss out. Oh gawd, yes.  Drink? Coffee shake. Make it a malt. Worth it. Too much for yourself? Ask them to split it in two! They're do it for ya.    Sides? Cheese fries. Oh gawd yes please. Wanna go all out? Top that off with fried shallots and ohhh baby, you better be going to XS to dance that alllll off.  All in all, good food for a good price in Vegas. Otherwise it's a literally pricey for a burger but other than that, def recommend if you have a huge crowd and hustlin to go to the clubs after, teeheee.",

We also got the double down fries which can easily feed about 2-3 people. Beware the peppers are a lot spicier than I first imagined and I wasn't a Big fan of the shack cheese sauce it tasted like watered down valveetta cheese to me.   Lastly, the reason I gave this place the benefit of 3 stars is because of the jackpot concrete. By far the best I've had in a long time!!! The custard was perfect in taste and texture and he Belgian waffle pieces they put inside were still warm on the inside even after I had mixed everything together. It was the highlight of my dinner",

Tasted like cheese wiz in a cheese sauce form but worse. So I'd just stick to the regular fries. They were also a bit salty.",

Food was even more enjoyable since they have a huge screen tv, cold AC as it was scorching hot outside, and we were able to watch the dubs beat the cavaliers. Go Shake Shack and go Warriors!!",

    "text": "After hearing about this place time and time again, finally had a chance to stop by and grab a bite.  We got there a little before noon on a Sunday and of course it was packed with everyone grabbing food before the long drive to wherever they came from.  We were in the first row to the door outside, but the line went by pretty quickly (10 mins or so).  That was about the only thing that was quick about this place...   We ordered 2 shack burgers, fries, and a strawberry lemonade.  Total came out to about $17 or so?  We went to sit down with our pager and......20 minutes later, we FINALLY got our food.  You would think with all the people there, they would be a little quicker and just have burgers on the grill nonstop.  I thought going to In-n-out was bad...this place is worse -_-.  We finally got buzzed, and the guy was totally confused with the orders.  He took one persons buzzer, and then my buzzer...and then someone elses buzzer.... and then.....didnt know whos order was whos.  This added to my frustration for the food taking so long.  Not to mention, the place was a complete mess from all the people there.  May not be their fault completely, but the left corner has a horrible set up.  There is only one way in and out of that area....and you constantly have people going in and out to get their food/drinks/exit.    Food was alright...burgers were pretty small compared to other places.  The patty itself was salty.  Fries were good, but hard to mess up on that.  Lemonde was good!  Overall, I may or may not be back... maybe will give it one more shot, but price and taste wise...In-n-out may be the winner...",

With each bite of the portobella mushroom, there would be plenty of cheese gushing out.  We also ordered a chocolate shake, which was very good.  It had a thick chocolate flavor.

Well it is a beautiful creation of a breaded and fried portobello mushroom filled with gooey melted muenster and cheddar cheeses. The patty was perfectly cooked and juicy without getting the bun soggy and the inclusion of the muenster cheese added a nice bit of sharpness. If double cheese isn't enough for you be sure to add an order of the crinkle cut Cheese Fries. Indulge your sweet tooth with frozen custards, shakes and floats.

For both the item it costed about $14. My sister only complaint was that she wish the buns were toasted but I prefer my buns the exact way they made it. (Untoasted) so if you prefer your buns toasted, remember to ask them if they could. It was my first meal at Vegas and my last.

The food itself is quite good and the employees are very friendly. The restaurant is clean and everything is pretty much as it should be. Four stars as I feel the food was quite good but not excellent... Something was missing that I couldn't put my finger on.  Regardless- check it out!",

We wandered here at 10am on Sunday (yes I wanted a heart attack for breakfast)... we killed 45mins exploring mgm and nyny... anxiously awaiting the 11am opening!!  When we returned ppl started piling up, waiting to come in... the nice staff opened up the doors for us at 10:55.  We didn't have a wait to order - staff was super friendly.  We ordered: 2 shake stacks, 2 fries, 2 crispy chicken sandwiches, jackpot concrete   That shake stack (deep fried portobello shroom stuffed with cheese atop a fresh burger with cheese) = I NEED THIS...  Wasn't impressed (I've had my fill of burgers on this trip and I was hoping to add this to my list of things I'd be craving)... kinda made me feel a bit sick (way too much cheese - and I freakin love cheese).  Concrete... Again wasn't blown away  Crispy Chicken with extra buttermilk herb mayo... HANDS DOWN BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH... Perfectly crisp, all white breast, fresh pickles and lettuce... and that mayo - delish!!!!!!!!  Id come back just for the chicken!! :)",

I've never tried Shake Shack before so I waited in line to order, it moved steadily and when it was my turn they were very quick and efficient. However, it takes FOREVER to get your food!! I may have waited 20 minutes for a single burger...  They all were working quick inside the kitchen but maybe the company underestimated how big the kitchen should be? It wasn't crowded inside, and just a steady trickle of people coming in as it's the off season and a Sunday night too, so I have no clue how they could ever handle a real crowd when something is going on at the new arena or something.  The burger itself was fine, I really liked the gooey sauce on there and the meat was very well seasoned, but the bread was kinda chewy, it overpowered the rest of the burger for me. I also got a creamsicle float, and the custard was amazingly smooth. However, there just wasn't enough in there! Most of my drink just tasted like I got an orange soda unfortunately.  The actual restaurant is spacious and trendy feeling, great atmosphere. However, I don't think I'm coming back anytime soon if I have to wait that long to actually eat :(",

The burgers are definitely better than the ones at In-N-Out!  My husband and I shared a burger, fries, and salted caramel hot chocolate and were very pleased with our purchase! The burger tasted super fresh and we gobbled it up in a matter of seconds because it was so good! The fries were equally as delicious and has become my husband's favorite fries!  Unfortunately, we did not have a shake so I cannot comment on the shakes but I highly recommend you stop by for a burger lunch meal!",

The bread is soft, the meat is crispy/soft/savory, and the veggies crunchy. The cheese fries rich, salty, and mouthy. I love it!  I've also sample the jackpot concrete - its a tasty sprinkle-y custard dessert only available at the Vegas location. I've also enjoyed the Shroom burger - its a deep fried mushroom stuffed with oozing cheese! MmmM.... If I had to choose though, I prefer the meat burger.  Service is also friendly and efficient. You order at the stand, and your pager buzzes when the food is ready to pick up. We got our meal in less than 10 minutes when it was pretty busy.",

My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place out again to see if In-N-Out is better, or if Shake Shack is better. We both ordered the Shack burger (BF added onions to his burger), and it took about 5-10 minutes for them to make it. It was about $11 for two burgers, which is pretty ridiculous compared to In-N-Out.  The burger is pretty small in general, with a Hawaiian bun type, a nice piece of patty, lettuce, tomatoes, and shack sauce. I didn't really like the taste of the burger that much, other than the patty since the shack sauce had a strong mayo flavor and the bun was too mushy. I definitely like In-N-Out burgers better than Shake Shack, but my BF disagrees. He thought it was good since it tastes dirtier than In-N-Out, but overpriced for the size.  I would try this place out if you have never tried it, but overall, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to try it again.",

When in New York, I make my way, of course, to Shake Shack.  The Shake Shack just outside New York-New York hotel & casino on the strip feels a lot like walking into the Shake Shack in the theatre district in NYC. Their burgers are True to the brand.  What makes a Shake Shack burger unique and amazing? It's the Martin's Potato roll. Okay, the Shack sauce is also key. The Vegas location does not depart from this perfect recipe.  So if you're a Texas Whataburger regular or you're a left-coaster with the In-n-Out urge, stop in to Shake Shack and see what the nor'easters are so crazy about.",

I assumed my first encounter with the venerable New York institution would be in New York itself, but I was happy to settle with Las Vegas (in, naturally, the New York New York casino).  It took a mere glance at the menu to decide that I wanted a double ShackBurger (cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce). I'll admit that the burger was much, much better than I expected. It arrived looking pretty much like a picture-perfect burger and the first bite certainly did not disappoint.  Pretty much my favorite thing in terms of a hamburger is that crust that forms on the griddle, and boy, did this burger have one hell of a crust. The meat itself could've been juicier, no doubt, but the combination of the irresistibly crusty patties and the perfectly proportioned condiments made this one of the best hamburgers I've eaten in a while.  We also ordered a side of the Crinkle Cut Fries, and they were fresh and delicious.",

I'm from LA and whenever I tell people I'm making a trip to Vegas, I always get a \"You HAVE to try Shake Shack!\" So I had to try Shake Shack :P The food was good, the prices not so good.. I got the Shack Stack ($9.59) and crinkle cut fries ($2.99)  while my boyfriend got the single All Shook Up frozen custard with mix-ins ($4.59) and the Shack-Cago Dog ($4.25). My friend got the single ShackBurger ($5.29). My burger was pretty good- the fried mushroom stuffed with melted cheese was definitely my favorite part of the burger! However, I finished it real quick and was still hungry for more.. their burgers are pretty small for $10 :/ I expect a burger at that price to fill me up. My boyfriend thought his hotdog was okay (came with a pickle, cucumber, onions, tomatoes and relish) and would've rather paid $1.50 for a more filling and equally tasty hotdog at Costco haha. My friend also thought the ShackBurger was tiny and rather pricy, for such a simple burger. Their fries however were pretty good- texture: crispy & crunchy!  Overall I wouldn't have any strong cravings or urges that would lead me back to this place, but it was nice to try just to see what it was all about.",

I had a chick named Inez ring me up and she was the best! I had this for my last meal in Vegas and I wanted to take some back home for my family. She insisted I eat my food first and when I'm ready for my to-go orders to come right back up to her instead of waiting in line. I thought it was really nice of her. Not only that but the other workers were friendly too, they clean your table, and even offer you refills on your drink.   Okay, but back to food. The Shack burger was exactly how I remembered it! So delicious. I had the Stack Burger this time and that deep fried mushroom in the middle. You take that first bite and the cheese oozes out. OH. MY. GOD. So freakin' bomb! The cheese fries and the strawberry milkshake was on point too.  Man, I'm craving Shake Shack again! I love this place. You get amazing food without the rude, fast paced environment of New York!

With that said, Shake Shack is just one of those places on my list of must eats every time I'm in a city where they are available to me.   I would compare the food to that of In-N-Out which is also on my list is must eats when near.  I prefer the crinkle cut cheese fries here and the frozen custard is pretty delicious.  5 stars for a great, casual, fast meal in a clean and trendy atmosphere.",

Our wait in line was about 30 minutes, which isn't THAT bad. I ordered the Shack Attack concrete and a single Shack Burger. I skipped the fries since I was splurging on the calories with the concrete- and I don't really enjoy crinkle cut fries.. I don't know it just reminds of failed attempts at home of Ole-Ida fries.  Anyways, their burger patty pretty much melts in your mouth once you bite into it. The bun is soft and puffy& their sauce just goes so well with the meat & bun. Well it must have been extra good too bc I was hungover and nothing but vodka and potato chips all weekend.",

    "text": "Will I compare this place to In and Out? Nope.  Why? I think they are very different, and while I like them both, there isn't a Shake Shack in SD, so there's no point.    Our first time here last year, the line was out the door.  It moved fairly quickly, but the wait for the food was a different story.  Not that it took too long, but that there wasn't a single place to sit while we waited.  We pretty much stalked a few people and jumped on their table as they left.  We each got a Shackburger (cheeseburger) and shared an order of fries with some cheese sauce.  The kiddo got a shake, and I really appreciated that it wasn't a huge, monstrous serving.  It was just enough shake, since it was super duper sweet.  The burgers themselves were super tasty.  I loved the simplicity.  But it was way too small.  I could've easily had another one.  The meat was flavorful, the cheese melted to perfection, the bun, and little soft.  Done in just a few bites.    Fast forward to the next trip here, and the line was again out the door, but not nearly as long.  The line moved super quick again.  This time, I had the SmokeShack which was a bacon cheeseburger topped with cherry peppers.  Man, this was it! The single was plenty.  Those cherry peppers added just the right amount of heat, and the bacon...yup, perfection.  We also had the chicken sandwich, and that too was delicious.  It's all about the pickle on this sammie.  As usual, we got it with the cheddar fries and were not disappointed.  Plenty of seating this time around.    If you're staying at NYNY, having this place so close would be deadly.  We've eaten at the Times Square location as well, and this location serves the exact same food.  Good to know it's consistent,  no matter what location you go to.",

They're so different that I don't think they can be compared.  Shake Shack was great! I got the Shack Stack which included a cheeseburger and the portabello mushroom patty. I was so surprised that the mushroom patty had so much cheese in it! But it made it delicious! :p  The location is very fitting since it is located in the New York New York hotel on the Strip.

Although it was a good burger, it wasn't anything crazily special.  The line was surprisingly very short and I ordered within a couple minutes of entering the place. They give you a buzzer thing that vibrates when your order is ready. I got the Shack Burger (single) and fries. There was no combo option and every item on the menu needed to be purchased separately. The meat in the burger was thick and juicy. I really enjoyed the burger, but wished I got a double patty because it was a bit small. The fries weren't that great and I wouldn't get them again. Next time I would get a bigger burger and no fries.  Seating was somewhat difficult to find for a group of 5. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to find a place to sit if it was a busier time.  Overall, I would recommend this spot if you're in the area and want a change from the typical In-N-Out! I don't know how it compares to the Shake Shacks in New York, but it's pretty good.",

My wife and I ordered a Shack Burger, Shack-cago Dog, 2 fries and a soda. The burger was cooked nicely, but the bun was soggy and cold. The size of the burger was smaller than most gourmet burgers I've eaten but still carried the high price tag. The hot dog tasted like an average hot dog but was butterflied, so it had a nice crisp every bite. The fries were hot but had no seasoning and simply tasted sub par to other burger chains.  Overall, my wife and I were not impressed with Shake Shack. The quality of the food in my opinion does not warrant the gourmet price tag.",

    "text": "I'm DEFINITELY a fan! Shake Shack ALWAYS wins the battle of the first meal in Vegas.  It's even BETTER when you're holding a MLife Platinum card so you can go up to the express line. There are two lines - the regular line is the winding one, and the express line is right up against the menu. So as long as you know what you're ordering, just walk right up and flash your HIGHER-TIER MLife membership card to get served next.  My go-to is the Shack Stack - \"Cheeseburger and crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce\". Seriously, if you love mushrooms as much as I do - you NEED to treat yoself to this burger. But be careful, the muenster and cheddar cheese WILL squeeze out the other side of your burger so it's best to eat it from the little baggy to catch the cheese. Or eat it over some fries for extra cheese.  The SmokeShack is the second best, IMO, with the all-natural applewood smoked bacon and chopped cherry peppers. The peppers do give it the tiniest bit of heat and crispy bacon is ALWAYS amazing.  You can also order the burgers (sans Shack Stack and Shroom Burger) as single or double. They'll also ask whether you want onions and pickles. You can also remove the lettuce and tomatoes if you want to make it \"your own\" burger or whatever.  I guess they also have fries and desserts on their menu, but honestly, I'd opt to get TWO burgers (the Shack Stack and SmokeShack) because the burgers are definitely smaller than other burgers. Oh! But their Shack-made Lemonade is the BOMB too! My mouth is watering as I'm writing this review and all I want to do is fly back to Vegas for these burgers.  One last thing - the place can get PACKED! Seats will get taken quickly. Literally everyone is gathered in the center of the restaurant waiting for their order OR getting their drink from the machines. Just wish there was more organization to the madness...",

The burger is proportional to the bun and lots of flavor from the patty. We also tried their shack cago dog and that was really good as well. The hot dog had a lot of flavor with pickles, relish, and onions. Would recommend getting a shake with your meal as well. Their shakes are thick and has the right flavor which isn't runny like other places. Will definitely come back when we visit Vegas again!",

Thier fries are also very good. I think these may be the best restaurant fries I've ever had.  But the best thing I had during my Las Vegas Trip was the Mushroom Burger.

    "text": "Decent fast food burger, nothing out of this world. I first had Shake Shack in NYC a few years ago and thought it was incredible. Not sure if the Vegas location is different, but I was disappointed this time around. The burgers are tasty, but a bit small - next time I'd get a double patty. The fries are basic crinkle-cut fries, nothing special. Also, the price is pretty high for a fast food place. Overall, in comparison to other similar burger fast food places like In-N-Out, it just doesn't hold up.   Tip: Wait to get your meal before you sit outside. They give you a buzzer, but mine never went off even though my food was ready. When I went back to check, my burger and fries had been sitting there for ten minutes and were cold.",

I ordered the burger with a portobello mushroom inside and it was okay. The cheese tasted kind of bitter to me. The best part was that the crispness of the mushroom helped make the burger taste better. Other than that, nothing special. Their \"special sauce\" is kind of like innout spread except it's more yellow in color, a little creamier, and tastes like it has a hint of garlic powder. Fries aren't amazing either, just tastes/looks like crinkle fries you can easily buy in the frozen aisle.   Place seems like a nice place to hang out though if you want to take a break from the strip.",

Forget In-N-Out, this place is x100 better!   The restaurant is located outside of the New York New York Hotel and right across the street from M&M World.   At Shake Shack you have to get a shake AND/OR frozen custard! They had chocolate, vanilla, cookies and cream and peanut butter to name a few.  There are about five different burgers to choose from and two sizes. Small or double. I decided to get the Shack Stack which was a cheeseburger and a deep fried Portabella mushroom. Yum! Of course there's the traditional cheese burger too. If beef isn't your thing, they do have a mushroom burger. Each burger comes with lettuce and tomatoes.   If you're not feeling a burger, they do have hot dogs and fries as well. Check out their cheese and bacon fries!! It's real cheese, not the fake stuff from the can.  The restaurant was fairly busy but service was fast and there were a bunch of paces to sit down. I was also surprised how fast our burgers were made. There was a switch-up, so be sure to check your order.   If you're ever in town or in the area, forget McDonalds and head over to Shake Shack!",

Their menu has a variety of options one is surely to find something to order. I've been to this location a couple times and have enjoyed my meal each time.   So far, I've ordered the ShackBurger, cheese and regular fries and nice cold brews. All satisfying without feeling \"bleh\" after.   My only mini gripe about SS, is the price. For a complete meal, a ShackBurger burger, fries and drink (beer in my case) is over $15! (more if you get higher priced items). If you're feeding a family, it gets pricey. However, the quality of the food has been consistent and doesn't disappoint in taste.   Located next to the strip and the T-Mobile Arena, the atmosphere is very Vegas, with good people watching and large crowds at times. It's definitely touristy and loud when it gets busy. There is ample seating inside and outside.   Shake shack is a nice treat when visiting Las Vegas and worth a visit. I'm definitely a fan and wouldn't turn down a chance to dine at this location again.",

I wanted to make absolute sure that I was not making a mistake. Yes, Shake Shack is more expensive. Value-wise, there is no competition to In-N-Out, but if you don't take into account price, then the burger at Shake Shack tastes better. Simple as that.  The griddled meat is the star of the show, as it should be in any burger. That sear develops a crust that adds so much flavor to the burger itself.  This may be a preposterous and unpopular conclusion as a California kid, but I love Shake Shack. And guess what, I also love In-N-Out. There. I said it. Don't @ me.  PS Don't get the Hot Chick'n.",

But our last trip to Vegas we stopped in here and I grabbed some fries and the person behind the counter was super helpful when I asked about a dedicated fryer so this trip we figured we'd grab fries before leaving and get something bigger later.  I saw they had a mushroom burger and gluten-free bun. I was excited but as soon as I asked about how it's cooked as I have food allergies, I knew I was in for a bad experience.  She acted like it was a big hassle to answer my questions.  I told her my allergies she rolled her eyes and asked 'what do you eat' in a very condescending tone. At this point I said never mind and I'd just get the fries but she weirdly tried to sell me on the chicken burger (um the opposite of veg/wheat-free). I kept insisting on just getting the fries and she went to get the manager so I explained to him and he confirmed there wasn't anything else without wheat so I again said I would just get the fries. I don't know why this was so hard to comprehend but I had to walk away from this woman and it ended up putting a sour note on our trip.",

My friend got me really excited for this burger joint since she said its only found in the east coast and that the burgers are really good. Unlike the Shake Shacks in New York, my friend said this location is huge and really nice! Fortunately, there was no wait what so ever and barely anyone inside since we came in pretty late, around 11PM. I ordered the Shack Stack burger and a  hot chocolate with sea salt. Our buzzers rang not too long after we ordered and we went to the counter to grab our burgers. The burgers are not that big but it was really tasty, especially with that fried mushroom in there. The fried mushroom gave  the burger a nice crispiness and I really enjoyed the flavor of the overall burger. I tried my friend's cheese fries and that was just ok since Im not a fan of crinkle fries. The hot chocolate was really good but very rich. If you don't have a sweet tooth like me, then it may be too sweet and thick for you. It was overall a very satisfying meal! :) Glad I finally got to try Shake Shack!",

The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I wish the cheese fries has more cheese. I feel kind of picky for saying it, but there really wasn't much.",

I think we got there earlier than the dinner crowd so we didn't have to wait too long to order -- it was nice though because we were given a menu while we inched our way up closer to the cashier. A big plus for me about the menu was they show how many calories every item on the menu was! How awesome! We ordered a Smoke Shack, a 'Shroom Burger, a side of cheese fries and vanilla concrete with caramel mixed in. Maaaaaaan... that 'Shroom Burger!! A fried portabello mushroom filled with cheddar and muenster cheese --- this thing was HOT! There was even a \"Caution\" sticker on it! Every single bite of this burger led to oozy cheese pouring out -- it was amazing!! The cheese fries were nothing special but if you like cheez whizzy-type of cheese fries, you'll be happy... like I was. The concrete we got was really delicious -- thick, creamy and simple. You can't beat that! I wish there was a Shake Shack in Dallas/Fort Worth... but maybe it's a good thing there isn't one. I'd probably be there too much...",

We ordered 2 shackburgers, 2 fries (one regular, one cheese), and an oreo shake.  The burgers were delicious and fresh, although if I were to come here again next time, I'd get a double patty. The normal crinkle fries were perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The cheese fries, on the other hand, were super soggy and the cheese was really bland - not worth the extra dollar.   Speaking of things that are not worth it, the cashier asked if I wanted whipped cream with my shake and without a second thought, I said yes...only to check my bill after and see that they were trying to up charge for add-ons.  Other than that, I had a pretty positive experience at Shake Shack and definitely understand the hype now!",

Surprisingly, the line wasn't too bad and the wait wasn't long especially on an early Saturday afternoon.  We had ordered two milkshakes, both vanilla and cookies and cream, as well as three bacon burgers and one Shackburger with crinkle fries.  Although on the pricey side because of its proximity to tourists attractions, the meat in each burger was perfectly cooked to where it was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Everything was flavorful and downright delicious.  The bread was soft and the portions in the burger were good!  On the flip side, the size of the burgers compared to the price was a bit disappointing.  Other than that, all is well.  On a final note, the staff is efficient and quite friendly.  The location gave the feel of a kitchen trailer with its amazing view of the strip through the glass windows.",

While the flavor is a good dose of black sesame, it's very sweet and dense. I had a hard time drinking it after the burger and fries. I'd opt for a more traditional flavor next time.  But the smoke shack and fries were delicious! You can't go wrong with bacon on a cheeseburger. The shake sauce is good too! It's hard to compare Shake Shack with In n Out, because I get different things. Shake Shack is a bit more expensive, but I would put it in the gourmet burger category, instead of basic burger category like In n Out.  Oh but the hamburger buns here are so buttery! Shake Shack is definitely one of the cheaper options on the strip, and the perfect meal before or after a flight!",

It was all a little soggy and the buns were actually a little cold! They definitely needed to be toasted for a lot longer. The double down fries were definitely the star of this meal, and it was more than enough for 4 girls to share. They were warm, comforting, and I loved those little pieces of bacon.   There is a lot of seating inside and the ordering process is really straightforward. You order, they give you one of those electronic buzzers, and you pick up at the counter when it goes off.   Super strong air conditioning in this location, which is a nice escape from the 40C Vegas heat. There's self serve water on tap too to keep you hydrated!",

I enjoyed my food and would definitely return when I'm visiting and in need of my fix, but this location gets SUPER busy.   While you can likely get through the line in five minutes or so, waiting for your food is where you're going to get caught - even if you do a mobile order. There were signs saying \"skip the line and order online\" - in an effort to promote their app, yet even when my sister and I placed a mobile order and received a text message to pick up our food, our order still wasn't ready. Apparently this also happened to some of the patrons that physically waited in line as well. They'd get buzzed that their food was done when in reality it was still being finished up/prepared. Confused? I know we were. Confused and hungry.  The food was good though. I want to end with that. I liked that I could customize my burger and got to add pickles, peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, etc. and it really added to my meal. My friends ordered the double down fries - a feat I've never tried until that fateful day and folks that stuff is a game-changer. First of all, it's hugeeeeee. Seriously if you order this you should either share it or not get anything else. Second, it's delicious. Yummy in da tummy. YAS YAS YAS.",

    "text": "I'm going to start off  by saying that Shake Shack is one of my favorite fast-food burgers ever. The first location I went to was in NY and I knew there would be a wait but after eating, I was sure that the wait would always be worth it because it wasn't just a \"hyped-up burger.\"   Unfortunately, I have very mixed feelings about the Shake Shack in Vegas now. I have been to this location a countless amount of times and the food is always great and yes there is always a long line (especially at night), but my recent visit left a bad taste in my mouth.   My BF and I got into the dreadful but what we thought was \"worth it\" line and waited as we have done it before . The line moved surprisingly fast but that's about all that was fast. The amount of time you wait for your food after you order is the trick in all of it. There were tons of people waiting all around tables where people were eating which is not only awkward but annoying that there is not enough space in the designated food-waiting area so you have to stand next to tables or give your back to them.  After waiting over 20 minutes and watching people who ordered way after us get their large orders of food before us, my BF went up to the girl giving out food-orders and demanded she get our food out to us. It may sound mean but it was necessary as it was ridiculous how our order was repeatedly skipped. We got our food and were left uncertain if we'll ever return to this Shake Shack location due to the disorganization in the kitchen and the over-the-top wait-time after ordering. Its not just the line you wait in to order, but the second line you have to wait in to receive your food which takes triple the time and is chaotic.",

My husband ordered our usual and the total was over $53.  We were excited because this was going to be our family's dinner before our long drive home.  We paid $40 in cash and the rest on the card.  When we received our two orders of milkshakes, one was filled up to the top while the other was not. It had over an inch and a half NOT filled.  Super obvious that they hadn't made enough for the two, and thought they could get away with it.  So, when my husband politely asked if it could be filled up to the top like the other one, the lady said, \"I don't know what to tell you.\" Um...what?! That's your answer?! How about, \"I'm sorry sir, let's fix that for you.\" But, \"I don't know what to tell you\" is not an appropriate answer!!  So, my husband asked another worker and she clearly saw that it wasn't topped off. She asked the \"I don't know what to tell you\" coworker if it could just be filled. Makes complete sense, right? Again, here's your chance to redeem yourself lady.  But, instead, she said, \"No!\" So the kind worker asked the manager.    And guess what the manager did?! He poured the contents of the chocolate milkshake into an identical cup...shook it, and then gave it to my husband!! Um...what the heck just happened?! Are you trying to fool us?! We couldn't believe he had the audacity to do such a thing!! So then we decided to return the two milkshakes.    He thought he was going super \"nice\" and said, \"I'll just return the whole order. It's on us.\" He credited only what was on the card, and didn't give us the cash. Wow. Thanks?  We love the food, but again, the customer service at this place blows. Be mindful of that.",

I'm from the Bay Area and I heard the new location in Palo Alto does not meet it's expectations so I never took the time to stop by.   People come to Vegas for two main things.  1. Drink/Party 2. EAT!   Shake Shack was FIRST on my list when arriving to Vegas. Thursday night, EDC weekend and the line wasn't long but the restaurant was packed. Luckily we found a table right away.   Someone mentioned their system is a bit weird because once the buzzer went off, you still have to wait for your food. At least my experience did not result with bad customer service, the cashier was actually nice.   Okay the burgers, ordered a double shackburger and the flavor of the meat was delicious, the flavors were there but I can't help to notice how extremely greasy it was - not juicy but GREASY. I used tons of napkins and you could see grease stains on the table from the previous people who sat there.   50/50 on coming back because there's so much more on the strip and I actually like their burgers if they weren't so greasy.",

I've been hearing a lot of stories about how good their burger is, that they are number 1 when it comes to the freshness and no use of antibiotics in their meat and you kknow what? they were right.  I have been wanting to try this for a long time now and finally it happened in the vegas strip!   We had the double shack burger and the one with fried pickles with garlic sauce, sorry can't remember the name of that burger and both of them are bomb!!!! Very very tasty and very juicy.  Meat is very tender.  The softness of the bread is really good.  They were both mouthwatering! Also had an order of their cheese fries and it was very good too.  Their chicken nuggets are crispy and food too.  The oreo shake was excellent!  The place is very nice.  Very unique design and very clean.  Staff are nice, I have no complains.  I am definitely coming back to this place, if not in vegas, in the LA area where I am from and try the other menu! 5 stars!!!",

I ordered my usual Shack Burger and Cheese Fries. The gal who took my order was pleasant but both nostrils of her nose were caked with snot. Not a little snot, tons. I could also barely hear her speak, it was a whisper. That would have been easy to get over after the order process was finished, but it did make me wonder about her handling food if her personal hygiene wasn't good. Unfortunately, it was all bad from here. My burger was cold, cheese was not melted and the center was not just pink, but red and raw. The fries were cold and soggy. My friend's chicken hot dog was also cold, but her regular fries were hot and crispy.   I told a woman at the counter about my burger, said I didn't need a refund or anything, and didn't want a do-over, because I had to leave. I just wanted them to know something had gone wrong so they could make sure it wasn't happening to anyone else. She just shrugged and took the burger and didn't say \"sorry about that\" or anything.   I am giving 2 stars because the place was at least very clean and nice and cool in the Vegas heat. But what a bummer.",

    "text": "My first time visiting a Shake Shack was their location in Chestnut Hill, MA. I wrote a review comparing them to In-n-Out (see link below); and I did complain about their soggy hand-cut fries, but it looks like that location has gone back to crinkle-cut like this LV location!  My cousin and I visited late night so the line was pretty quick. The service was friendly, and my cousin even got some free crinkle cut fries! The presentation of the burger was much better here (you'd think it'd be similar/the same since it's a corporate company) - similar to In-n-Out, the buns flared out a bit so you could easily see the inside.  As usual, I got my Smoke Shack which was awesome as always. Much spicier from the cherry peppers than I remember from Chestnut Hill. They had a good amount of bacon in every bite, and the patty was juicy! Their buns are also on the softer-sweeter side which I actually like but some may not prefer it.   Lastly, I was also happy to see crunchy, crinkle-cut fries in comparison to the soggy ones I've had before at their other location.   Overall, great experience. I'll be back since this is my closest Shake Shack to San Diego (hopefully, just for now)!  ---  My review of Shake Shack - Chestnut Hill, MA: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/shake-shack-chestnut-hill?hrid=UsxMgM1M1fi9ApID91_siw\">yelp.com/biz/shake-shack...</a>",

In one simple answer: \"The Shack Stack burger .\" A breaded and fried, portobello mushroom stuffed with gooey cheese on top of a juicy cheese burger.   This is what separates shake shack from everyone else. Although they offer regular burgers and cheese burgers as well as hotdogs, it's the uniqueness of the shack stack that I found SS a burger place I would keep coming back to.   On the downside, the price for the shack stack is just under $10.00 and nothing else but the sandwich. You may order  fries or cheesy fries or just a thick custard based milk shake.   I love East coast restaurants venturing  out here to the West coast, so keep them coming.",

I had their veggie mushroom as part of their cheeseburger with the mushroom it in. It was so so good.

I always get the Shackburger. If you like the meaty/cheesy flavor, you'll likely enjoy Shake Shack more. All personal preference.   The Chick'n Shack sandwiches are tasty if you want to try something different (might even be better than Chik-fil-a). The concretes are delicious if you're looking for something cold and refreshing on a hot Las Vegas day. The Shackmeister Ale is a nice pairing to drink with your burger while people watching on the patio.   We came after 1pm on a Saturday and didn't have to wait long, let alone in a line out the door. Altogether a good experience. TIP: If you're only ordering cold items, ditch the regular line and hop into the C-Line!",

Both their chicken burger and the beef patty burgers (Shack Burger) taste great, come out pretty quickly, and don't cost too much.   The line goes fast, don't get intimidated. We had to catch a show next-door and only had about 45 mins, and we made it just in time after enjoying our burgers here.  The burger buns were a little soggy for me, and tasted more on the gummy side. I think if they were grilled a bit longer and were crispier, I would have enjoyed it more.   Try out their cheesy french fries - it's  a basket of fries with melted (cheddar?) cheese on top. They give you a little wooden fork to eat the fries so your hands don't get too cheesy.",

I got the black and white shake, it was just ok, but hubby got the chocolate malt and that was fantastic. If you really want a rich, calorie-filled, splurge while visiting Las Vegas, this is definitely the place to visit. Little tip, if you want to just grab something super quick, like a shake and take it to go, there is a pickup window at the front of the restaurant so you don't have to wait in the long line.",

The food was good, but it didn't live up to the hype for me. I got the Shack Stack, it was delicious and did the job well for me. My main issue was the fries, they were really basic and tasted like they came out of a frozen bag and were thrown in the fryer. The concrete shake was really good, the Belgium waffle mix in added something unique in flavor. It was good, but that's all it was. Would have been just as satisfied if not more satisfied with In-N-Out.",

Imo, burger here is better than other burger restaurants from celebrity chefs in Vegas, taste, portion and price wise. The burger is small (enough for small person like me, but big guy should get two), and I love portion control so it works well for me. At $5, it is inexpensive but not cheap for a single burger. A Shroom Burger is almost $10, expensive but is a must try for first timer since it is quite unique. The meat is well seasoned, on the dry side but still acceptable. Get the regular fries! the cheese made the fries soggy and we didn't like that. We got a shake and half/half drink, good, but not memorable. The line was long but moved quickly. Place gets crowded but people comes in and out so just be patient to get a seat.",

Instead of offering limited choices, which would have been perfectly reasonable, they asked if we would be OK waiting and then proceeded to give us samples of their ice creams, fries, and floats.  I had my kids with me and they had employees entertain and engage them while we waited.  After all that, they thanked us for waiting 10 minutes (don't you always have to wait about 10 minutes when things are busy?) And comped us our entire meal.  I haven't even tried the food as we wait for it to arrive but I can honestly say this is better service than I've seen even at high end restaurants.  Seeing the long line made me worry about bringing the kids.  Anytime we are in town, we will come back to the Shake Shack.",

Got the shroom burger...  It was super tiny! (Slider size) for $6.99... I totally thought it was much bigger... it was tasty but it wasn't worth the money...   Cheese fries...  $3.95 or so... small portion as well but the cheese sauce on fries was delicious... but man... so little cheese too....    Concrete:  Got the all in one chocolate concrete... it was not too sweet and yummy... but gotta take out the cookie dough and the toffee next time... way too sweet with those in it...  Final verdict... I would go back but probably won't purposely plan a visit there... (Like I did this time around)  The size of the burgers are simply not worth it... it was much bigger when they first opened but now it has shrunk in size... hope they will take into consideration and make their burgers slightly bigger....  Otherwise, they will not be a competition to in-n-out...",

One of the managers came into our shop and told us to check it out.  So, we did!  Completly happy we did too!    Our order consisted of one of the Shake Shack Burgers -omg!!!  I could eat those mushroom filled caps any day!  They stuff a portabella mushroom cap with Munster and some other cheese then they roll it in bread crumbs and deep fry it. The result is a crispy shroom with gooey cheese pouring out of it. Add the rest of the normal burger fillings and you got a match made in heaven.     In addition to our burgers we ordered the following:   Cheese fries- honestly, they didn't look like much at all but they were simple and pretty darn good.   Beer float - they put a scoop of their creamy vanilla custard in a cup with dark, almost tart beer. Not sure if I would order this again but it was good and the flavors completely complemented each other.   Cranberry-Ginger Lemonade - no artificial flavor here, quenched our thirst and tasted like fresh and spicy ginger.",

    "text": "Not worth it.  Some east coast friends raved about Shake Shack back there, and I figured I'd try the one in Vegas since it was a short walk from the hotel and right on The Strip.   Good location.  Clean inside.  But overpriced and a tourist trap.  Two of us had a burger, fries and one very small (there's only one size and it's shockingly tiny) vanilla shake.  It came to over 33 dollars for that.  The \"shake sauce\" on the burger is not great, and pretty darn bland.  The fries are crinkle cut and I swear they look and taste like a poor man's version of frozen Ore Ida brand fries.  Not flavorful.  Not good.  I'd say to skip this place entirely... except for one thing:  They have booth seating (which is cool), but the funny part is the booths are up a small step from the floor.  There's even a little sign telling people to watch their step.  Being Las Vegas, it seems like everyone is a tourist and either drunk or oblivious to signs, and we kept seeing person after person trip on the step while we sat there.  It was hilarious.  I hate to laugh when people fall, but it was almost comically hysterical.  Skip seeing Celine Dion at Caesars or Britney at Planet Hollywood... and come watch this:  it's the best show in Vegas!  Super funny pratfalls by dumb people who keep tripping on those dang steps.",

I even bought a souvenir shirt on the way out with how committed I was after eating here--the hype's real.   The  Service: Saturday lines are SUPER LONG but faster than you think! Friendly + Knowledgeable  Going through the line took 15-20 minutes. I forgot the name of the cashier that helped me, but I remember hearing her speak Japanese to the people before me. She was really nice and was patient with my family's large order.   Shout out to one of the staff there named Edith for helping us out in the line by answering a lot of the questions we did have and coming to check on us when we ate! My dad used to manage restaurants and all I could hear was him comment on how efficient the staff was and how fast their food was coming out for how many people there were in the large dining room. By the time we finished eating, my mom wanted to order a couple more shroom burgers to take away. For some reason it took longer than it did before and when it came the food burgers felt colder. Before we said anything, Edith showed up! She had them remade and we had it in our hands under 5 minutes. We tried tipping her but she refused and said hospitality's always included. We were all so blown away! My parents are excited to see Shake Shack come to Portland soon!   Food Quality: drive 4 hours, stand in line, and happily wait for food DELICIOUS   Burgers to get: everything on the menu  Burgers we can vouch for because we ate them: shroom, shake stack, chicken, smoke shack -The shroom and Shake Stack are identical except the Shake Stack has the cheese patty. When you see that it says it has mushrooms, it's not like the mushroom you expect like on a pizza. It's a fried mushroom with melt in your mouth cheese inside.  -The chicken shack was pretty good too! It has a small spicy kick, but it's a good balance between the lettuce and some sort of their own ranch looking sauce.  -Smoke shack was the cheese burger with bacon and spicy pepper bits. It had their signature sauce, and it was beyond good. I wish the burgers were bigger given how good they are!   Also you must try the Cookies & Cream shake alongside some cheese fries!   Atmosphere: Loud + Exciting  The dining room's modern and simple in design. Main focus points include the front of the kitchen, huge TV screen wall on the other side of the menu, and table seating everywhere. It's seat-yourself type dining so if you had a big party like we did beware wandering for tables may take a while. If you don't like crowds, I would order take out.   Pricing: More expensive, but worth it  Among 5 people we ordered: 5 burgers, 1 chicken, 2 shakes, and 3 small soda drinks (which by the way, they give free refills on). We paid like $80 with tax.",

I was wholly disappointed when my husband and I made this our dinner stop for the first night of our staycation on the Strip.  Located at NYNY, but actually outside of the casino, the outside of the restaurant is visually appealing, and draws the eye. Once inside you get immediately wrangled into a queue in front of their large menu board. This is nice as you can decide what you want while you wait in line.  I got a single ShackBurger with everything ($5.19), my husband got a double ($7.99). Note, this is just the burger, doesn't even come with fries or a drink. Maybe I'd be OK with the jacked up price - if the burgers were not BABY-SIZED. Seriously, they're tiny. Ya, they're good, the taste is awesome. Yes, very well cooked, but STILL. And yes, I know it's jacked up strip pricing. Still don't care.  Also got the black and white shake (small) and a large Fat Tire that came with a plastic souvenir cup, and a bottle of water  All in all, two people, for dinner at a fast-casual place ended up being $36.98. Yes, almost $40. We could have actually had a sit down meal for that much.   Will not be back.",

I had never heard of this East Coast change before this so when my gal friend said we had to go, I just shrugged and assented.  I wasn't about to argue since she had already graciously to go to In N Out with me!  I ordered the standard Shack Burger even though I wanted the Shack Stack (but since we had a class afterwards, I didn't want to risk nausea or worse, throwing up from eating too closely to exercising.  Since both of us did not care of In N Out fries the day before (we already knew that going in) and ended up throwing away a lot of fries, we decided to share one order of fries between us here.  The fries are SO MUCH BETTER.  They are crispy crinkle-cut style.  Yum.  They were fresh and not soggy (from sitting around) at all.  It was still a good idea to share an order, though.  The quality of burger was really excellent and I'm one who can be kind of picky about that stuff.  Yum.    My friend ordered the Shack Stack and it looked amazing!!!!  She said it was super good but left a couple of bites uneaten because she was too full.  She had also ordered a shake with it, so that would explain it.  I liked the sizes of the shakes and floats - very moderate and not outrageous.  I prefer quality over quantity.  I went with the root beer float since I wanted a taste of their custard but not a whole shake (again the whole heavy foods right before exercising thing).  I would come here again!",

Took a short trip to Vegas and some friends wanted to try it so I was definitely eager to see what all the hype was about.  Now, unfortunately I only had a burger and fries so I cannot comment on the shakes.  I came for the meat and potatoes and I was not disappointed. I had the double cheeseburger and the cheese fries, which was not the best idea, but still tasty. Next time I'd prefer the fries plain buuuut the burger was delicious.  It was how  I always want my In N Out burger to taste...beefy. The burgers are a nice size and their cheese is unique because they make their own blend. Honestly, it kind of tastes like Velveeta but I was ok with that! It worked with the burger flavor overall. The bun was nice and soft and I like how they don't cut all the way through, so it's almost like your burger is nestled snugly in a nice potato bun pocket. At least it tasted like a potato bun. Easy to hold and kept everything from sliding out!  Also they have crinkle cut fries which are my jam. Give me crinkles, waffles, tots...anything but shoestring and you've got me.  I'm a fan...and personally, I like it more than our classic In N Out. I know, I've defected!! So I'll just turn in my West Coast card and see myself out.",

    "text": "Shake Shack is more of a 3.5 but I rounded up because of the filling quality. I ordered a Shack Burger with Shack Sauce on the side in fear of the burger being overwhelmed. The sauce was actually very delicious and had a nice creamy consistency. The sauce complemented the burger well. I also ordered French fries which were nice and crispy but a little on the salty side. My mom got the cheese fries which were decent but not amazing. The burger itself looks pretty small and I finished it rather quickly however with the fries, the meal left me very stuffed which was relieved by a walk on the Strip. Overall, I would return however I won't be running back just to eat the Shackburger. Next time, I hope to try the frozen custard which looked very promising.",

The decor and vibe in the shake shak was comfy and welcoming to everyone (families with kids, recent college grads, older folks).

    "text": "What a delicious experience! Came here the 1st weekend in May with my husband and two others. We all shared a bit of everything since we were Shake Shack virgins. Here is what our order consisted of:  2 red wines, 1 beer Shack Meister Ale, 1 Single Shack Burger, 1 Single Shack Stack, 2 Single Smoke Shack, 1 Chick 'n Shack, 1 Shack-Cago Dog, 1 Cheese fries, 1 Coffee Shake, 2 Single Concretes: peanut butter sauce and the other strawberry puree. ALL was delicious. For me, I LOVED the Shack Burger, simple standard burger but the taste and flavor was a punch in the face. So delicious!!! From that moment on, anything else I tried was just, meh. The Chick 'n Shack was a little too rich and heavy for me. I probably wouldn't order the Shack-Cago Dog again because too many flavors were mixed together. The Cheese Fries a definite 2 orders next time. My husband really enjoyed the Smoke Shack, because he liked the spiciness. Wouldn't get the shakes but the concretes are a new texture I haven't experienced. Thicker and almost gummier in texture but all delicious! All in all a great meal! With full bellies, we headed back to the hotel pool and laid there like beached whales. Seriously, there must be crack in their food because I am still craving that Shack Burger!",

They have those beeper/buzzer things to tell you when your order is ready, and they messed that up too.  They beeped me, and tried to give me someone else's meal.  Eventually I got our food, and got it straightened out.  The food was actually really good.  Mine was a very tasty burger, no complaints at all about the taste or quality.  Fries were fine, too.  We ordered their current special shake, \"red velvet\" flavored, supposedly.  I would definitely SKIP that - as it had no discernible flavor of any kind.  Probably regular flavors are better.  Staff needs some more training, and they weren't really friendly, but my guess is it is a total drag to deal with tourists all day.  Locals - burgers are good, but not worth any special trip to the Strip.",

It came with the cheese, one thin slice of lettuce, four small slices of tomato and their sauce. Burger had good flavor but the sauce took away from that so if I go back I'll get sauce on the side. \"Smashburger\" and \"in-n-out\" have way better burgers for the price. The shake was good but for 5.25 you would expect a larger cup. I'll have to go and try the fries to see how they are next. Seating area is small so you may have to wait for a place to sit or go outside on some of the few tables they have there. Just remember when it's 100 degrees out the water spray may help a little.",

First of all, don't order the fries. The worst fries ever at any resteraunt.  The cheese sauce helped a bit but.... dry and greasy. My shack stack, first bite, cheese squirted out the other side onto the table. The next few bites were delicious! However I soon felt a greasy film in my mouth. Yuck! Don't know if it was grease from the meat, bad cheese, or whatever they fried the portabella mushroom in. The double ham was fine, so suspect the mushroom. The chocolate custard was good, the red velvet was not. I don't think it was even red velvet. Don't the know it's chocolate? It tasted more like what others call birthday cake with red velvet cake crumbled on top. The root beer was good. Kinda wish I tried the float. Something made my daughters throat tighten up (not entirely sure what she's allergic to). Also, I asked that the burgers be cooked medium well. She said they did that anyways. Apparently she didn't hear the well part. The real problems came later. Searching for a bathroom. We both had that problem.",

The restaurant is very noisy, so be prepared to either scream at each other, or eat in silence.  The food then: the burgers were very good. Juicy and tasted very nice. The fries was just ok, nothing more. Actually, they tasted and looked exactly the same as the ones you buy in your local grocery store in Sweden, from the freezer and put in the oven at home. :) Nothing wrong with that, but hey, I expect a little bit more here..  All in all, good good burger, standard fries, expensive drinks.  Would probably go again, if I was outside and hungry. On the other hand, Five Guys is just 10 minutes drive, and MUUUUUCH better. ;)",

    "text": "I'm about as loyal to In-n-Out as they come.  So naturally, I feel like I am committing some form of infidelity by writing this review.  The burger was exceptional.  I have tried the Shack Burger and the Smoke Shack.  My wife had their shroom burger.  We have been back 4 times.    Notably, we are from Southern California and don't gamble.  So yes, I have craved the Shack bad enough to drive 3.5 hours, enjoy the Shack, and turn around and drive another 3.5 hours.  The burger is juicy and tender, the toppings are always fresh (a bi-product of quality selection and high-turnover), and the bun is an excellent choice.  Four things to know if you are thinking about going:  1) The line can be exceptionally long.  Honestly, I am always impressed with how fast they move the line.  I cannot complain, but some people need instant burger gratification.  This may not be the place (but by that token maybe avoid In-n-Out too).    2) The fries are crinkle cut and plain.  It feels a little odd to have such a dressed up well-planned (and executed) burger and then a small tray of crinkles next to it.  I personally am fine with it because they have always been cooked perfectly and seasoned well, but this may turn some people off.   3)  The burgers are somewhat simple.  Some of their burgers are a little more intricate, but for the most part they are pretty standard.  That said, they take the simple and make each ingredient as spectacular as possible.  The way they \"dress up\" their burgers is to elevate each ingredient individually.    4) Finally, the price is a little steeper than some other chains.  Everything is served a la carte, so it ends up being around $15 a person for a burger, fries, and drink.  I personally would take this restaurant over any of the \"sit-down\" chains in the price range like Chilis or Red Robin.  I don't have a problem for this reason.  If you are looking for a better costing option - I can't reccomend the In-n-Out across Interstate 15 enough.",

    "text": "Shake Shack has opened in Las Vegas with a bang. I have been a huge fan for years, and since moving to Vegas from the East Coast I couldn't be happier to see it in Sin City.   I went the first weekend it opened, and the line was VERY long for being 5 p.m. on a Sunday night. It was all hands on deck--tons of staff members were working in the kitchen and working the dining room floor.  Here's how it works at Shake Shack: You get in line, place your order, get your buzzer and wait for your buzzer to ring. Try to get a spot at one of the tables while you wait. Then you pick up your tray at the counter.  All of their burgers are bomb--my favorite is the Smoke Shack with bacon and little bits of spicy pickled peppers. Vegetarians will be happy with their portabello burger, which is stuffed with cheese and then fried. So decadent. Their cheese fries are AMAZING--don't think about the calories, just indulge. They recently switched back to their crinkle cut fries, which aren't \"fresh-cut\" but have that nostalgia factor.  I am a personal fan of Shake Shack's hot dogs--their Shack-cago dogs are freaking amazing.  During this visit, one of the staff members saw that it was my friend's birthday and offered to bring her a frozen custard of her choice. When they brought it out a bunch of staff came out and surrounded our table, and then one worker started singing Happy Birthday. She had a fantastic voice!  The only thing I would suggest is that they extend their late night hours. Plenty of people would love to do their drunk eating at the Shack! ;)",

Moderate prices but I think when each person described their experience, you honestly thought it was going to be the greatest thing you've ever eaten.  I enjoyed the burger, though thought it could have been bigger for the price and I think being as hungry as I was when I arrived, got me to fork over more than I wished for burgers, fries and two shakes. All in all, I liked their selection, though wish they had more choices of sides and that for what you paid the burger was a bit bigger or a little more flavorful, but eh its a hamburger. Probably on par with In-N-Out though some locations have lost their luster so at least on par with the better ones.",

I love the layout of the store and the sign is very nice. Very easy to spot. When you walk in, you can easily read the menu on their wall, but they also give you smaller ones if you want to look at it. I got in line and knew immediately what I wanted. I got to try the Shack Stack. I split it with my boyfriend and half a burger filled me up, and I have a huge stomach! It was delicious! The cheese oozed out and the mushroom perfectly complimented the burger. It was pricey, but so worth it! It definitely hit the top of my list of burgers. The fries are also really good here! They are perfectly crispy which doesn't happen with crinkle cut fries. I loved it! I want to come back for a custard or concrete one day! I will definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in Vegas",

I wondered to myself  \"what's the big deal about this place?\"  Now, having tried it for myself, I still am wondering \"what's the big deal about this place?\"  First of all, everything on the menu is a-la-carte, there are no combo meals.  I had the standard ShackBurger ($5.19), Fries ($2.95) and an Iced Tea ($2.75), total cost w/tax: $11.77.  Pricey for a burger & fries, but it is a strip eatery, so you figure the prices are a bit inflated.  I've noticed that people compare this place to In-n-Out Burger quite a bit.  Well, the burgers are cooked when the order is placed, and they do come wrapped in paper like In-n-Out, but that's where the similarity ends.  My burger was pretty ho-hum, nothing to rave about.  The fries were good, crinkle-cut style, and nice & hot. I did not try one of their shakes, however there was nothing about the food that I did have that would make me come back again.  For a similar price, I'd rather go to Fuddruckers for a burger, it's much bigger and better.  And as far as a comparison to In-n-Out, there is none.  In-n-Out rules!",

Definitely better than In and Out, but nothing compared to a place like Pearl's in San Francisco. Note the entrance is on the Strip, so you have to exit New York, New York and walk around.   Picks: ShackBurger ($5.19 Single) Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce was good but not great like expected. Good ingredients but not much meat.  SmokeShack ($6.74) Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce. The addition of bacon helped a little, but we did not detect high quality smoked bacon.  'Shroom Burger (vegetarian) ($6.99) Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. Anything deep fried is tasty, even veggies.  Not very healthy though, but its Vegas Baby!  Shack-cago Dog ($4) Dragged through the garden with Rick's Picks Shack relish, onion, cucumber, pickle, tomato, sport pepper, celery salt and mustard. This one actually impressed us more than the burgers.  Crinkle Cut Fries ($2.95) were fantastic.  If only the burger could be this good.  Hand-spun vanilla Shake ($5.25) 640 calories and worth it. Thick and creamy.  Creamsicle Float ($5.25) was beautiful and hit the spot. (It was 105 degrees outside)  Just OK: None  Would not reorder: None  Overall - Good Food - Very Good Decor - Very Good Service - Very Good Value - Good  Would we come back - Maybe",

My friends and me walked by it a couple of times to get a sense of how long the lines were and they varied every hour. Eventually we were able to get in when the crowd died down. I recently had Shake Shack in the East Coast and I expected that this one would taste about the same. I ordered the shackburger and cheese fries and they tasted nothing like the ones in the East Coast. The flavor was completely off and it was not as juicy either. The burgers and the cheese all tasted different and not as good. I'm not sure what they're doing wrong but they gotta work on it if they want to stay competitive on The Strip. I much rather eat at In-n-Out instead of this Shake Shake. It also gave my friends diarrhea just like some of the other reviewers on this page so beware.",

Is the burger delicious? Why yes, it is!  Was it worth the price? Not really. Perhaps once or twice, but definitely way too pricey for what it is: burger, fries, and a shake.  Which, will need to be ordered separately (no combo deals here).  The black & white shake was supposedly the most popular, so I tried that. Wasn't really feeling it, but then again, I'm not much of a shake person.  The cheesy fries were delicious. Then again, cheese makes anything delicious!   One double burger, cheesy fries, and shake for about $20.  Donate $2 for a voucher that you can redeem at your next visit for a free shake.  Located next to New York New York.",

Flavors are novel and so inventive. IMHO this trumps the other popular West coast-based burger chain with cult following. Also love the Black and White shake and Shack Attack concrete.   So it is with mixed feelings that I have to put out a word of caution. Two members of our group had symptoms of food poisoning (upset stomach and more). The only thing they ate which was different from the rest is the Black and White shake. I hope this is just a fluke. They recovered in a day or two.   If you're driving in and not staying in any of the hotels, best place to park is NY NY self parking with entrance on Tropicana Ave. Walk into hotel through casino floor and head towards the strip.",

Shakes have no taste and are bland as can be. Ordered the peanut butter shake. Tasted like plain old vanilla.  Went to 5he location in Summerland hoping it would be better. The place was empty and we Still waited forever for our food and it was bland there as well. No thank you Shake Shack.",

Have never eaten there before and was impressed with the quality of the food, pricing, and overall atmosphere. The first time in we missed the lunch rush so our wait was quick.  Our second trip was a different story with a line queued all the way to the door, but even then the line moved quickly to order our food.  Our group tried the ShackBurgers, hot dogs, cheese fries, chocolate shake, and the \"All Shook Up\" concrete.  All super tasty (hence the reason for 2 visits).

I can't complain too much because we had really good service after they had to change out the keg for the beer we ordered. They made sure we knew what the hold up was and gave us a beer to enjoy while waiting for the one they had to change out. The server personally delivered to our table even though people are suppose to pick up their order from the counter themselves.   Thanks for the great service!",

Wait time pretty long about 45mins and finally we have our burger. I had the stack burger? It's with portobello mushroom. And dang it's pretty yummy. Not bad but for us Californian in and out still had em at the price, and total wait time. Everyone has different about their burger so for me, not a bad burger at all. I would come back and have em again.  I gave em 4 star since wait is killing me and if I came during slow time. I definetly gave 5 stars.",

Well,  I  want you to forget about all of the negative remarks from everyone else on here!  After enjoying a meal here tonight with my Son all I can say is FABULOUS!!  We both had single burgers with Fry's, his were cheesy ones. And we both had shakes.  Everything was absolutely perfect couldn't have been happier with our choice for dinner this evening. As far as price, I feel it was adequate for the quality of food we received. If you are in Vegas you must give these Burgers a try.  I promise we will be back again.",

    "text": "If there's just one thing NY'ers do well, it's food.  I was afraid the hype would skew my senses and I would be disappointed because of the unbelievably high bar my mind was placing on this burger. It didn't. The hype is real.  Simple foods, like burgers, pizza's, hotdog's, that require such few ingredients, mean that those ingredients play huge rolls individually. Shake Shack proves that. They use a brioche bun (vs a cheap run of the mill bun), roma tomatoes (vs regular), green leaf lettuce (vs iceberg). They're serious about hitting all the right notes.  It's simply a great burger.   For me, for several reasons, it's not fair to compare this to In-N-Out. Sure, they're both burgers, but that's where the similarities end. I'm no fan of In-N-Out. I can write a book on the subject. This is far better, no competition, however, for the simple fact that this burger is roughly 30-50% more expensive, it's not comparable.  They're kind of pricey, especially considering how small their burgers are. That's the only negative that comes to mind.  Get the SmokeShack. Get two.  Food: 5 Ambience: 4 Service: 4 Value: 4",

Don't get me wrong, you can taste the quality of the ingredients but you MUST order the Shack Stack to experience Shake Shack's fullest potential. To complete the experience, the crinkle cut fries and a shake must be added to make this even more satisfying!  The breaded mushroom filled with cheese stuck inside the burger is absolute heaven. The cheese oozes out as you bite into it. The combination of what's inside compliments each other magically.  The crinkle cut fries are cooked to perfect and the shakes are thick and creamy. The person ahead of us recommended we didn't share the shake as we had planned (I wanted to cut calories) and we are glad we didn't. Once you have a sip, you are willingly committed to drinking the whole thing to completion.  Get in line already!",

I heard good things about this place, I was anxious to try it. Took my first bite, amazing! You can really taste the flavor of the beef and definitely can tell it was never frozen. Love at first bite. After that meal, I was hooked!  Second time, I was craving it bad. Ordered the shack burger and cheese fries. This time, it wasn't as good. I almost thought this place was better than in n out, almost! It is definitely comparable, but nothing beats in n out. The cheese sauce on the fries was delicious. I would come back here again though, only because its on the strip and I dont have to drive anywhere.",

Had two single cheeseburgers with two orders of fries and a drink. ~$20, not bad for two people on the Las Vegas Strip.   But the meat was thin, the meat was greasy and salty along with the fries, too much sodium.   Overall good value for the price but food could have been better.",

FYI: we came here twice before we left Vegas and on our last day, immediately after eating our Excalibur Buffet, we drove right over for our Burgers TO GO. Yeah, we had to get our burgers to take back to California and enjoy it at home. We got three, and it made it home safely without us scarfing them down our throats!

    "text": "A New York burger joint in New York-New York? Rather creative if you ask me. But is it worth the hype? No, not at all.  After hearing about Shake Shack opening up in Vegas, I practically begged my cousins to eat here for an early dinner just to see what the fuss is all about.  Shake Shack follows an order-and-pickup routine. In other words, brace yourself for long lines! This new addition to the Strip will certainly draw in some crowds (both locals and tourists) during peak season. During my visit, the line went pretty fast, as it wasn't terribly long. However, by the time we left, the line was already heading out the door.  I ordered the Shack Burger (single). It was fairly average for the most part. Nothing really stood out. I did like the buttery buns, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend the burger itself.  We also shared orders of cheese fries. I personally enjoyed the cheese fries. The cheese sauce was creamy and tasty. I did notice that we weren't given as much cheese as other pictures posted on Yelp (which may be due to a shortage of cheese sauce that a few unhappy customers were complaining about when we were leaving the establishment), but any more cheese, and it would've been overwhelming. The fries itself are not mind-blowing, but they compliment the burger nonetheless.  I also had their strawberry malted milkshake. Just like the burger, it was fairly standard. No artificial strawberry flavor, which was nice. However, I've definitely had better milkshakes.  Price-wise, it's quite expensive. A single Shack Burger, cheese fries and a strawberry milkshake went past the $10 mark, which is pricey for the quality and portions you get.  In conclusion, it's awesome that they've opened a NY burger joint in Vegas (New York-New York to keep with tradition.) But if you don't know what to expect, don't excite yourself. You may be disappointed with the end result.  I most likely will not return.",

    "text": "The westernmost outpost of the Danny Meyer burger empire is located in Vegas, most befittingly in an outdoor courtyard of the New York-New York hotel/casino. Considering how popular they are in the eastern half of the US it has generated a lot of buzz; it's been on my Vegas bucket list ever since the opening was announced. A year later I got the opportunity to go as my sister had a Shake Shack craving.  CONCEPT: Fast-casual burger chain with burgers priced between $5 and $10, along the lines of a Five Guys or Smashburger with the cult appeal approaching that of In-N-Out Burger. According to Shake Shack's official website, the burgers are made with the following ingredients: - 100% natural all-Angus beef sourced with cows not fed with hormones or antibiotics. The meat is freshly ground. - Fresh veggies - choose from a combo of lettuce, tomato, pickles or onions. - The bun is a non-GMO Martin's Potato Roll.  The fries are of the frozen crinkle-cut Yukon kind and the shakes are made from freshly spun frozen custard.   VENUE: Located *outside* the casino formerly the site of ESPN zone.  SERVICE: Counter service only. When my family went on New Years Day lunchtime we were in line for less than 5 minutes. This was considering that the line was outside. There was a slightly longer wait for our food to be ready.   Your meal is ready when your buzzer rings.  My first Shake Shack meal consisted of a Shack Stack burger (Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce) and their crinkle-cut fries. I sipped a little bit of my sister's shake as I wasn't in the mood for a shake at the time. - My sister says that it's an East Coast thing for softer buns (dunno if this is True). I appreciated the softer, sweeter bun and it's comparable to a perfectly toasted In-N-Out bun. - Veggies were fresh. - The portobello mushroom was freshly fried and I could hear the pop of the mushroom meat opening. The melted muenster cheese just made the mushroom burger just taste meatier. - Burger patty was cooked to my liking. Cheeses made the burger slightly moist.  Crinkle fries were cooked consistently so all fries were crispy but they were a little on the plain side. The shake was also a little on the plain side but this was due to my sister's preference. Next time I'll get a different flavor shake and have it malted.  Though the prices reflect the Vegas standard (read: expensive!) the burger quality is worth a return visit. Though my preference still is a good In-N-Out burger more I can appreciate this burger for what it is and I understand why the East Coasters are up in arms about this chain. It certainly beats White Castle and Five Guys.",

The crinkle fries were really crispy but nothing special.    Both the cheeseburger and chicken shack were really small! They definitely don't justify the price. We paid $21 for one chicken shack, regular cheeseburger, one order of fries, and one large drink.   I was pretty hungry when we came here and even tho it tasted good, I was not impressed. Thankfully there was a minimal line, if there was a large line (like how it was roped off) I would have been even more disappointed.

Anyways, we're here for EDC weekend so expect the lines to be quite long as usual, which for us the place was packed and had about an hour long line that stretched to the outside. Even in the hot sun, the staff were very helpful giving out menus beforehand, running the built-in mist machines and handing out free cone-esque water cups outside. I had the double smoke stack with a shack Cago dog which is are both so tender and juicy, so think of this like a gourmet dine-in. Note that the smoke stack doesn't come with lettuce if you're into that, but everyone seemed to enjoy their time here and always order 2 things so you don't starve!",

You must order first and they will call you when your order is ready.   I decided to go with a hamburger with lettuce, pickles, and onion with shack sauce. I thought my burger was delicious. I thought it was better than in n out cause of the bread they use. The bread was nice and soft and it soaks up the juice perfectly. I could eat this burger forever.   I also got an order of crinkle cut cheese fries and jackpot concretes. I thought the two didn't live up to the hype.   Shake shack is a little bit more expensive than the fast burger joint here. I would skip the sides and just get the burgers time and time again.",

    "text": "Simple, fresh, and downright DELICIOUS!!!  We had already eaten burgers at Gordon Ramsey's burGR earlier in our trip, and I didn't really want to eat burgers again, but my brother highly recommended trying the Shake Shack, and when my brother highly recommends something, I take him seriously because it takes a lot to impress him.  I had the hamburger with everything on it, and it was juicy, tasty and had all the right textures. I liked that there was just the right amount of everything so that nothing was dripping or falling out.  Everything was just perfection - not too greasy, not too dry, not soggy.  The veggies they use are fresh and nothing beats hot, perfectly salted crinkle fries.  My husband had the portabello mushroom burger which interestingly, was a batter and fried portabello that is stuffed with oozing cheddar cheese.  Although it's the vegetarian option, it's not as healthy as most vegetarian choices in other establishments.  You can add this oozing portabello mushroom to any burger on the menu.  It's definitely different and I've never seen anything like it before, but one bite was enough for me.  It's very rich.   If you have any room left after devouring your tasty burger and fries, be sure to try the frozen custard.  We ordered a \"concrete\" to share which had peanut butter, toffee, chocolate and bananas in it.  It was so creamy and so smooth and most importantly, so sinfully delicious!    We didn't order any shakes, which is absolute blasphemy at a place known for and named SHAKE shack, but I had two more days left in Vegas!  I'm a light packer and my only pair of jeans that I brought with me had to be able to zipper up for two more days!  This just gives me an excuse to revisit Shake Shack the next time we are in Vegas.    The ambiance here is bright, fun, and modern.  The tables were handmade in Brooklyn (the original Shake Shack is famous in NY) from reclaimed wood that was a bowling lane in it's past life. I appreciate detailed touches like that.  We happened to go on the night of the Grammy's and we sat in our booth while eating and enjoying the Grammy's on the Big Screen in the middle of Shake Shack.  Needless to say, I have never had a better experience with food and ambiance in a burger joint than I did at Shake Shack.  Thanks brother, for leading me in the right direction, yet again!",

Some other good burgers that I've tried and were good are the Shroom Burger and Shack Stack.  Note: the shroom burger has no meat. Don't forget to order some fries to compliment your Burger. The fries are crispy and yummy too! Love Shake Shack not only for their delicious food, but because they also serve alcohol! Shake Shacks burgers are different compared to In N Out burgers because of how their hamburgers taste, but for those wondering, I still prefer In N Out over Shake Shack.",

Also the buns used for everything had a lightly sweet flavor and was really soft.

You really can't miss this place as it's a great iconic place located on The Strip now right next to New York-New York and Monte Carlo.  This always happens to be our first stop when we arrive at Vegas. Most likely because we tend to arrive around lunch time and this is such a great, quick stop.  The line goes by soooo fast! Most of the time, I don't have enough time to make up my mind whilst I stare at the huge menu of options. Burgers, shakes, hot dogs, what's not to get?!  FAVS: - Shack Stack: SO GOOD. Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce. The fried mushroom does it for me (for a vegetarian option of the same thing: try the 'Shroom Burger). - Cheese Fries: All the cheesy goodness!! One order is good to share for 2-5 people (depending on how much everyone eats). - Frozen Custard or Concrete: If it's your first time, definitely try one! I personally prefer the Concrete (it's basically like a mix-up of everything you like + frozen custard!)  I think the brioche bun gets me every time on those burgers. They give it a little oomph! Will definitely be back. Cheers!",

Given that we were here on vacation, we decided to order a little more then just a \"burger\". We got the stack shack + bacon cheddar fries. This meal did not disappoint. The burger was juicy and full of flavour. The mushroom and melted cheese topped it off. Probably the best burger ive ever had. Simple but yet delicious. The fries were good too- Cheese was nice and hot.  The service there was very friendly.  Only drawback was the shake. Ive heard great things about it, but i couldnt try it because there is no lactose free option. Not their fault, but it wouldve made my shake shack experience complete. Nonetheless, top notch burger joint.",

There is one line & when you get near the registers there is someone directing you to a register. Its pretty congested. I can't imagine being there when it's really busy. The line will clearly be out of the door. I had the chicken sandwich & fries & it was fresh, crispy & tasty. My fries were cooked just the way I like them. My daughter had a burger of which she also enjoyed.",

I think the thing I enjoy the most about the hamburger was the bun. The fries also are more of a type that I prefer.  I know this is Las Vegas so there is a little bit of a benefit of the doubt but service isn't as prompt or as professional as  in and out.  In addition, cleanliness was lacking throughout the entire facility. The dining room was a wreck as was the kitchen where you could look back.  I give bun quality to them shake shack over in and out and that is it. Other than that overall value for dollar, taste, cleanliness, promptness to guest and overall customer service I give to in and out.",

It's located outside the NYNY. Indoor / outdoor seating . Inside was somewhat clean. Pedestrian only access.   Line was somewhat long so instead of waiting in line , I decided to order online via the Shake Shack app. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and fries. The app was easy to use . After approximately 20 minutes , I received a notification that my food was ready.   I walked to the pick up area and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....for approximately 15 minutes until my order was finally called. The lady working the pick up area was kind of rude and you could tell she was a little overwhelmed .   My meal was nothing special. Not hot and the taste was just like any ole fast food joint .   No offense , but I'll probably never come back to a Shake Shack as long as I don't have to.",

    "text": "It's an east coast chain, so it's guaranteed to have that uniform-Shake-Shack taste. Their greasy burgers hit the spot when you're hungover.  In case you didn't digest the name, this place is known for its shakes. So, ya gotta try one. Handspun options include: Vanilla, Chocolate, Caramel, Black & White, Strawberry, Peanut Butter or Coffee Fair Shake. They don't come in a fancy glass cup...so that was a bit of a let down, but the creamy consistency made up for the glass.  The specialty Shake Shack sauce isn't too noticeable on burgers but does enhance the flavor.  My friend said the gluten free bun \"wasn't disgusting and actually good.\" A rarity for her gluten free burgers.  I wouldn't go out of your way to visit, though.  If you are staying at the New York New York hotel or nearby, try Shake Shack for lunch, but attempt to limit your chain consumption in Vegas! Plenty of great local eats that are just as affordable.",

I've had the shake shack in New York and although I can't speak for the burgers, the shake I had in NY was wayyyyy better than here.  We got the shack stack which is the burger with the portobello mushroom, everyone told us it was a must order, but I was very unimpressed with it. It tasted super ordinary, wasn't very flavorful and definitely did not justify the hefty price tag.  Also got the cheese fries. They didn't taste very crispy or fresh and the cheese was like nacho cheese almost but I think nacho cheese tastes even better.  I was really hoping the milk shake would save the meal but I was yet again disappointed. We got the strawberry shake it was worse than any fast food shake I've ever had. Super bland and had an incredible amount of whipped cream.  Over priced and super meh. I would prefer not to come back.",

I really don't understand what the hype is about. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich this time, and it was just ok. The cut of the chicken was thick, and it was cooked well, but it was definitely over flavored (wayyyy too salty). The chicago-style hotdog was cooked dry and the bun was soggy (it broke before I finished it). The shake was way too sweet.. If you like overpriced burgers, this may be the place for you. But for me, In-n-Out is still way better.",

It ended up being more cost efficient to share a double with my husband than it would have been to order two separate singles.  My only qualm is the mix in to frozen custard ratio. I felt there weren't as many mix ins, and it ends up being basically a plain frozen custard.   As for ordering, even though the line is long, it moves quickly. The people are extremely friendly, and the service is efficient.  As expected, it's pretty busy and noisy. That being said, it was still easy to find somewhere to sit.   I haven't tried other food at this particular location, but I have when I lived on the east coast. I think it's a viable option if you're looking for affordable food on the strip. Everywhere else is going to be a lot more expensive.",

    "text": "My friends and I go here sometimes when we are at Vegas. This is a good place to try at least once in your life. A lot of people are comparing this burger joint to In-n-Out. In my honest opinion, I would go to In-n-Out. However, if you haven't tried this place out, I would suggest you do so. You'll get a different taste, especially if you order the Shake Stack Burger they have on their menu. If you're going to try this place, go all out to see the difference. I don't recommend ordering the plain burger, it's not as flavorful, but though it is cheaper...so weigh your options.  Plan your stay....Line is long depending on the time you come here. Sometimes it goes all the way out of the door and down the stairs.   Seating is a bit hard to find if there's a lot of people. I suggest having your friends find it while you order. There's inside and outside seating. If you find any free seats, I recommend you just take it for now until you find some place else for you and your friends.  I ordered the Shake Stack Burger and Shack Burger (single). Shake Stack Burger was flavorful and is a big burger. It is filling. The angus meat is juicy with the smoked flavor. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth getting. The Shack Burger, I felt, tasted just like a regular burger with the meat being a little bit more flavored, but not much.   Fries were ok. They sell the crinkled fries. I, also had the Cheese Fries before too, it was way too cheesy for me. I don't really liked that taste. I personally think In-n-Out fries with their spread is absolutely delicious!! So I guess nothing can compare. LOL.  I still think In-n-Out is better because of their low prices and quality of food is comparable to this place.",

I really enjoyed biting into the fried portobello mushroom because it had a crunchy texture. My friend ordered the smoke shack burger, which was a cheeseburger and consisted with ranch bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and shack sauce. He did not like his burger at allllllllll. He didn't even finish it considering how small the burger was!!! We also got the cheese fries, which was delicious the cheddar cheese they used was like nacho cheese. YUMMY.  Overall, I'm a bit disappointed coming here because the burger was small and it was double the price of how much you would normally pay for a in and out burger. (like everyone says) If I had to choose between in and out or shake shack, hands down I give it up in and out. Sorry not sorry lol.  Also, the wait was pretty long considering it was a Tuesday afternoon. We had to wait about 30 mins in order to get our food.",

For a \"fast food\" establishment, the quality is great.   People keep making the comparison between this place and In N Out but the two are completely different thus not right to compare. If I were to judge solely on taste, In N Out burgers win. For variety, Shake Shack wins.   The organic potato buns would have been better if they were toasted. For the price, I guess quantity shouldn't matter (I need 2-3 of these burgers to be satisfied). The burgers were under-seasoned. I can say that these burgers are not greasy. The fries were fried perfectly and seasoned perfectly.   The thing that won me is their Shack Attack. I got a single for my son. I tried it and needed to get my own (and one for my daughter in the C-line) right after our lunch. The C-line is for beverages and cold delicacies. What a brilliant idea!   I'd go here just for the chocolate frozen custard; it is incredibly sweet, rich, thick, and chocolatey. Do not order this if you do not like your desserts sweet.  + long ass lines + lines move fast though  + friendly service  + fairly clean  + variety on the menu + non-GMO offerings + water dispenser and cups by the condiment bar + get the fries + get the Shack Attack - you're welcome",

I definitely love how it just fits in Vegas with the sign in bright lights. When we lined up, there was hardly anyone in line, so we go to order right away. We had to wait a bit for our food, but luckily we weren't starving by the time we got there.   FOOD & DRINK: the chicken sandwich is really tasty. I would choose it over the chicken sandwich at Chick-Fil-A even though it's a close call between the two. The prices are pretty reasonable. And they do serve alcohol. I also got a side of fries and a black&white shake. One person in my group did not like the shake after he tried mine. I thought it was okay but definitely on the extra sweet side. I got cheese fries and I liked how they were crispy even with the cheese on top. Still would choose In-n-out fries over these fries, but the chicken sandwich reigned supreme above all the chicken burgers I've tried in that price range.   ATMOSPHERE: they have a TV playing sports! It was great especially since it's playoffs season. There was plenty of seating and it was overall very clean. The bathroom had a single sink and two stalls, so if it gets busy that's probably where you would have to wait the longest. The bathroom though was pretty clean. I liked how there was outdoor seating. Since it was mid-April, the weather was perfect for sitting outside.   Satisfaction rating: *Two thumbs up*",

    "text": "Review from Tripadvisor posting: ----------------------------------------------- My first meal off the plane HAD to be this place. I've been waiting to eat at this place again since I first tried to in LA earlier this year and the line was already at the door despite it being 4pm.   The menu is right in front of you so you can look at it and decide all you want while you're waiting in line up once you're at the counter, the menu board is way behind you so you'll have to know your orders off the top of your head.   As much as I loved Shake Shack on my first experience, I forgot how pricey this place could get. I got a full meal of cheese fries, shack stack burger and chocolate cookies and cream shake which cost me over 20USD; compared to In-N-Out lovers, this place is definitely a lot pricier.   With the long line means that the wait time is equally as long for your food and overall, I was actually pretty disappointed on this second experience.   The shack stack burger has a deep fried mushroom and on my first experience came with a \"caution-hot\" sticker since the mushroom will ooze out with juices when you bite into it but the disappointing thing about this one was that firstly, I didn't get a sticker and most importantly, the mushroom was not pipping hot!   The cheese fries were too salty for my liking and perhaps I'd suggest getting just the fries itself as the cheese cools down and hardens quite quickly.   So unfortunately the they didn't have the mint cookies and cream shake I tried last time since it was a seasonal thing so I tried another seasonal special which was the chocolate cookies and cream. I'm generally not a fan of chocolate ice cream but I'd say this was the best part of the meal and definitely a very good way to beat the Vegas heat!  Guess I'll have to come back here again cause...third time's the charm right?",

    "text": "Wow sad eating experience. At first I was like Shake Shack so close to CA?? Oh yeah!! But giving our order was not so great. Our host, Deetreid, was not welcoming: did not say hi or smile and was busy writing as we stood in front of him, did not ask if my mom wanted any burger, was impatient when we wanted mint custard (the special flavor of the week). We said yes after talking to him about it. After verifying he read out our order. Picking up we found we were not given the custard and would have to go back to line. What. The. Heck. Not our fault. And the burger did not have extra lettuce or tomatoes as requested. Lesson learned. Make sure your order is correct not just what was said, but IN WRITING -- check your receipt! So looking again at the receipt: Hamburger, Shroom,  and fries for $15.27?? Not worth it.   The burger was dry around the edges and hard to chew, fries dry... I made no happy food noise. My mom ate her Shroom (first time) and didn't say anything. Later said the mushroom was small and greasy. I loved all these when I went to the NYC locations (every time worth raving). Always perfect even though lines were long. Here the ambiance is more like a generic burger joint with large TV screens (playing sports) with men staring and eating so this Shack Shack location highlight is mostly the TV not the food. We won't return. If you want a great burger, check out the Counter.",

    "text": "I made it to Shake Shack the last two nights and my impression of the place was there are better burger places in town for sure.    There wasn't much of a wait either night. When entering an employee handed out a readable menu in case you don't want to look at the giant wall menu. I was lucky enough on the first visit to be handed a sample of the custard. I prefer custard over ice cream and it was good. With multiple people taking orders the line moves fast. You are handed a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready and it doesn't take long to get your food. Condiments are located at a couple of stations along with napkins, straws and utensils.    I had the double shack burger and the shack stack. The burgers themselves are a bit greasy but still flavorful. Both came with shack sauce which is a garlic/ mayo spread that is just ok but the downfall was the Crisp fried portobello. Filled with Munster and cheddar cheese it is served with a warning that it is hot. To me it has a steamy watery taste when you bite into and ruined the burger. The fries were your basic crinkle cut fries you can find in the freezer section of the local grocery store. I must of had the bottom of the bag as all the fries were broken off pieces and not the thicker meaty pieces. I liked the draught root beer they served. It is made in Louisiana at a brewing company and is one of the best I've tasted.    I want to go back and try a shake or a Concrete( like a DQ blizzard). They have a lot of flavors and have a monthly schedule of custards that change weekly. This is something to grab while in the area but not worth going out of your way for. Their prices are high but being on the strip that's expected.",

It's almost like they feel like they have to convince themselves that they love this place so that it makes up for leaving all our amazing weather.  This location is outside the New York, New York in Vegas, facing the Strip. (I.e. don't walk inside the hotel, or you'll be lost trying to find it, because it's actually outside.) I can see this place resonating with people who don't have an appreciation for value, or people who want to tell other people that something they've haven't been able to try is awesome. In my experience, it's a really tiny burger with a big price tag and decent flavor.  I'm not a big eater by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that burger took me 6-7 bites to consume. That plus a drink was $10. I had finished my food before my roommate (who was in line behind me, and ordered the exact same thing) had even gotten his order. While the burger WAS decently tasty, it wasn't THAT much tastier than say, Carl's, where this meal would cost $7, and it would come with fries.  I didn't have room for a shake because I'd gotten a shake earlier in the day, and they were out of the signature flavor for the day. I'm not a big fan of crinkle-cut fries, and this place did nothing to change my mind. The ones drenched in cheese were even worse, as the cheese sauce adds very little in flavor.  Overpriced, overhyped, over it. The Father's Office burger is still the greatest burger out there.",

However, it's Vegas and you're still drunk from day club at 8 PM and you cannot process any self thought-out combinations. The fries are pretty good considering they stayed crunchy, but THOSE are kind of dry. Someone recommended my friend like peanut butter sauce or something?? I highly do not recommend it - it's like... melted peanut butter and that's just weird on a burger. I'm probably going to have to try everything on their menu.

I missed Shake Shack twice - once in New York (when we hadn't heard of it yet) and another time in Boston (when we stumbled upon it JUST after we finished eating).  When I heard Shack Shake had opened up in Las Vegas a couple weeks before my trip, I knew I had to try!  Thank the jesus I did because it was pretty dang good.  I ordered the 'shroom burger for myself and when I had my first bite I couldn't put it down and I didn't wanna share.   I didn't have any expectations but what it would be like, but I much prefer veggie burgers over meat most of the time so I knew I was ordering it.  It was pretty amaze.  The patty consisted of a Portobello mushroom stuffed with white gooey cheese and then DEEP FRIED. It gives it an amazing breaded crunchy texture.  It's lovely with the other fresh ingredients - like lettuce and tomato.  The bun is really fitting too.  Nice and soft but not too soft.  I tried a bite of the smoke shack burger my husband had.  It was pretty good with a nice bite of jalapeno, but I much preferred mine over his.  We also got three things of fries to share between five people.  Two cheese and one regular.  I liked the cheese but the fries are really good on their own that you can just eat with ketchup.  I would skip the cheese next time and save my dollar for a slot machine.  I love you shroom burger.  You get my 5/5.",

The wait for the food to come out wasn't very long, and they had plenty of seating at this location on the strip near New York New York, but was definitely filling up. I liked the crinkle cut fries, but I wish there was a little more cheese sauce. The burger itself was hot, juicy, and slightly greasy which I didn't mind, i was hungry. The chocolate malt was thick and tasty. I definitely liked the food, more so than Five Guys and on par with Fatburger. Would I say it's better than In n Out? Not quite, but it's different. The fries for sure I liked better, but that's just me. In n Out has fresher, thick slices of tomato and lettuce so it's definitely based on preference.",

A gussied up McDonald's or Five Guys style place with kitschy add-ons and beer. Is what it is...the burgers are slightly better than fast-food and you can get them your way...prices a re dirt cheap and for milling about Las Vegas all day hunger it was a good filler-upperer.  Line was quite long, but the place was easy to find (on the street access off Las Vegas Blvd), attached to the north corner of the NYNY hotel/casino.  Please is great for Vegas cheats, prices are cheap, food is decent...cannot go wrong. Eventually there will be Shake Shack all around the country as they try to court the gourmet burger market.  Good luck to you Shack!  ENJOY!",

The buns are unique...so soft. I liked that the burgers aren't gigantic. I love that the meat is hormone-free. They accidentally place my order as being a hotdog instead of a cheeseburger. When I went to the counter, they quickly refunded my money and immediately had my burger reader. The shakes were perfect. Ordered a chocolate frozen custard to share. Perfection!",

They use fresh, quality ingredients which is a lot better than what you'll get at fast food burger joints. And they also serve alcohol! And shakes. Their fries are crunchy and not too salty which I thought was perfect. Their burger buns are fluffy. The portion sizes were very great. And the toppings you can put on the burgers were very tasty. The space at the Vegas location is very big, modern, and clean. The service was friendly and your food came out fast. I can't wait to come back here!",

Whether it be the cupcakes at Magnolia Cafe, the pastrami at Carnegie Deli (vs. the superior Jewish delis in L.A.), the Cronut or the frozen hot chocolate craze, I learn hard.  Here, the fries are not better than frozen Ore-Ida French fries sold in plastic bags at the market.  You know the variety: corrugated, large, tasteless.   The patty was of the caliber you get at a church luncheon.  Store bought, fatty.  Vegetables and bun also below par.

I no longer have to stare at my past shack shack photos and drool!  My Opinion: Dont expect to compare this place to in and out.  There is no comparison.  They are 2 completely diff. types of burgers & atmospheres.   They are both equally delicious in their own way.  As in and out is known for their sauce, shake shack is known for their deep fried portobellos stuffed mushroom burger (you can either get it with or without a beef patty).   This Las Vegas location is spacious and nice!  Bigger than the shake shack locations I've been to in New York.  Of course its placed in New York New York... go figure! Perfect!",

    "text": "For my second trip to Las Vegas, I KNEW I had to try Shake Shack rather than the typical In-N-Out everyone goes to. Conveniently outside of the New York New York hotel on the Strip. I usually hear that there's a long line for this place but luckily I didn't have a line when I went! My friends and I went after a pool party on my birthday so we needed to refuel our energy. We decided to sit at this long table in the middle of the restaurant with comfy chairs since we had ten people in our group.  I ordered the Shake Burger with fries and a chocolate milkshake on the side. Honestly this is the best burger I have ever tasted! The meat was cooked perfectly and had a little bit of pink and juiciness to it, which I like. The fries and shake were pretty good also, though I couldn't finish both of them. The fries had a nice crispy texture once you take a bite with a little bit of salty flavor, which I like. The shake was probably too rich for my taste buds, which is the main reason why I couldn't finish it.  Overall I was happy that we ate here. A bit pricey for everything I got but I would still come back here next time I'm in Vegas... Or when I visit New York. Whenever that is. (;",

This place is GREAT for weekend late night snack as you stumble back to your hotel after losing your rent money...again.  I had the chicken sandwich and some fries and thought they were the bomb (welcome back 1999).  The service was good considering the number of customers waiting for food.  It took about 10 minutes to order and 10 minutes to receive, but there were a TON of people in line so it really wasn't bad.",

The lady who worked there said people would line up in NY and wait up to 3 hours in line for a burger.  Totally not worth standing in line that long, don't get me wrong they are tasty burgers but not that good. They are very fresh and the meat, veggies, and buns are tasty. My bf got a hotdog and that was tasty as well.   Of course being a Shake place we had to get a black and white and that was good also. Overall I wouldn't go crazy over this place because it reminds me so much of In-N-Out but it was fresh and yummy.",

    "text": "They're located on the Strip next to Starbucks at NY NY (not inside the casino). Outdoor and indoor seating. Buzzer system for orders.  First day at CES and we hadn't had a meal all day. I heard they just opened this location and had to come here. I've been to serveral locations in NYC and miss the burgers here. Coming from CA, I prefer these burgers over In-n-Out because the buns are so soft and I'm not a fan of thousand island dressing.  My order: Shack Stack: $9.49 Double Concrete: ($4.50) Oatmeal Creme Pie w/ banana  chocolate cheesecake and chocolate toffee Additional toppings: +$0.60 each  My meat patty was on the thin side with a large battered and fried mushroom & gushing with cheese. My friend's burger was thicker and more juicy. The fries are crisscut fries and very hot and not overly crunchy. Cheese on the fries had the consistency of cheese whiz.  Allison had said my concrete was made incorrectly when I went to go pick up my food, so she said she would bring it out to me when they were done. When she did, she noticed that we had ordered the cheese fries and suggested adding their cherry peppers if we liked a little spice. We said we'd try it so she came back out with a tray with a condiment cup of the cherry peppers but also a cup of bacon chunks & another order of cheese fries. She said it was in case we didn't like it but boy did we love the cherry peppers!  The weekly flavor was oatmeal creme pie and was intensely sweet and had an strong oatmeal raisin cookie flavor. I had added banana chocolate cheesecake (as suggested by the cashier) and chocolate toffee toppings which didn't help with the sweetness at all.  I've been to serveral Shake Shack locations in NYC and the fact that they're willing to bring you your food if something wrong and the personal suggestions when you're unsure makes this location so much better. So happy they opened up!",

Fortunately, the line moved along quickly and after ordering my food, it came out pretty fast.  There is another, shorter line just outside the restaurant for ordering just desserts and custards.  I was in the normal line inside for ordering from the entire menu which featured burgers, fries, hotdogs, etc.  This review is for the shack-cago dog that I ordered.  It was delicious and had a lot of toppings.  The only problem I had was that because of all the toppings and relish on the hotdog, it started getting soggy and was difficult to hold together halfway through.  That was probably unavoidable though.  The price for my hotdog came out  to $4.32.    My friend ordered just a burger which was around $12.  While I enjoyed the food and atmosphere at Shake Shack, I probably won't be going here very often since the prices are high for the casual fare.",

We ordered the crinkle cut Yukon gold French fries, as well.  I have NEVER eaten crinkle cut fries that were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside without them being burnt. These were perfect!  They were perfectly salted--no ketchup needed.  I would return to the Shake Shack just for the fries. I'm not into shakes, but the family ordered a black and white shake that they said was thick and creamy and they loved it.    An employee greeted everyone in line with a menu so that we could decide what we wanted before we got to the register.  That may have sped up the line so that we were not standing in the hot sun for long. The dining area was also quite clean and I didn't feel as if I needed to wipe the furniture before sitting down.

TIP:  You have to specifically state everything you want otherwise it'll end up being very plain...   Shack stack was good but a bit overwhelming so I'd probably just stick to a cheeseburger. Cheese fries were a good touch too.  Can't wait to try their milkshake next time.   Honestly, it's good but not amazing. A bit overhyped .",

I noticed a selling point of this place is that their beef is raised without hormones or antibiotics and that alone can draw in a certain kind of crowd, but for myself, it doesn't make a difference. They do have a selection of hot dogs, shakes, and frozen custards available as well if you want to add some flavor to your meal. Each time I have visited, I have gotten the hamburger with fries. To be honest, the food is more expensive than other fast food places, and you don't necessarily get more for your dollar either. Their burgers taste just like any other hamburger and their fries are crinkle fries that don't have anything really special about them. The hype around it was not backed up by their food or price at all. It's definitely always worth trying a place once, but these places aren't guaranteed a second visit unless there is a reason to go back. Shake Shack unfortunately has not given me a reason to go back, but definitely worth trying.",

Once I received my order that's where things went wrong. At first glance the size of the shake was about 25% less than your normal fast food serving and at $5.30 a pop it was just an ordinary shake, no probably below average. It was very creamy but for me that wasn't a good thing. I like mine rich and thick. I understand being at New York New York I'm going to pay Strip Prices but I had to see what the hype was about.",

We had heard of Shake Shack before and due to the pictures and menu on here we decided to give it a try!   With all of the money we had spent on food during our vacation so far we were expecting expensive, this place was not! We were pleasantly shocked. We also asked about MLife perks and found out that we could essentially \"skip the line\" which is awesome because their lines were out the door at 11PM! The ladies at the checkout counter were so nice and helpful even though we knew they most likely dealt with crappy people all night long.   I got a hot dog, fries, and a soda. My husband got a vanilla shake. My hot dog was a little on the greasier side, but it would have definitely made for good drunk food had I not been stone sober ha ha. The fries were perfectly crispy and salted, which to me is something very rarely done right! My husband loved his vanilla shake.   When we come to Vegas again there is no doubt in my mind we will visit Shake Shack!",

Everything sounded so good. If I had the money and stomach, I'd order everything on the menu. I got the single shakeshack burger (a cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, and shakeshack sauce). I also got the cheese fries. My friends all got cheese burgers and got the double and fries.   The food took about 10 minutes. This place reminded me of a higher end In n out. The cheese burger was delicious. The cheese fries were good but the cheese was in a separate container (seemed like nacho cheese on the side). Price of the food was a a bit expensive but the quality of the food outweighed that. The atmosphere was great! Would definitely come back for the burgers but would stick to the crinkle-cut fries!",

I tried and shared the chick n shack and the shack burger so I had half of each burger. I probably prefer the chick n shack a little more just because there was more texture to the burger. It was still a little on the dry side but the pickles and veggies help the burger a little bit. Then there is the shack burger which I thought is so so. It's just that if you had in - n - out, I don't really see why I would ever come here to eat. I think the one unique thing I find a bit interesting is their bun. I kinda like their soft buns that went with the burger. However, the insides just didn't do it for me. It's not only expensive but it didn't win me over with their pricing + their quality.  You paying 6-7 dollars without fries for a small burger(around the size of a McDonald burger) and maybe some people can get full from it but I surely didn't. Also tried the fries which weren't bad but I might have to pick McDonald fries(which I haven't had in years).   Will I come back? Prob not. I don't get the hype and I don't get the wait for this place.",

We ordered a single hamburger ($4.29), a double hamburger ($6.59), 2x crinkle fries ($2.99 each), and a single Shack Attack custard ($4.59)... and then again the same order for take-away. #fattylife  The Shack operates as the storefront in front of New York New York hotel on the strip. I had bookmarked the joint for some time now because it's so hard to find cheap, good, quality food for under $10 in Vegas, but Shake Shack fit the bill.  They tout 100% all-natural Angus beef burgers. The patties were definitely hearty, no flimsiness here! The buns glowed with brioche-likeness and held up considerably well to all of the fresh toppings of crunchy lettuce, crisp slices of tomatoes, raw white onion rings, and brined cucumbers.  The Shack Attack is a chocolate lovers' dream; fudge sauce on chocolate custard on chocolate truffle and cookie dough, on Mast Brothers dark chocolate chunks, topped with chocolate sprinkles. *mic drop*  The room is airy and light, facing the new Park and T-Mobile arena. Squad up in their comfy, cushioned booths, dine outside on their picnic tables, people-watch on their high top bar tables, or just find a seat inside and chow down.  Dog lovers rejoice! This location offer a Bog o'Bones for $7.50 for 5 biscuits from Bocce's Bakery in NYC as well as a Pooch-ini $3.85, think sundae but with peanut butter sauce and topped with a dog biscuit.",

We also shared Cheese Fries, I would also order those again. We also shared a Black & White Malt, I would probably try a different one just because there are so many to choose from.  Thank goodness this location is on the strip in Vegas, where you can walk all those calories off.",

    "text": "I love Shake Shack, but my husband begs to differ. I am one of those few who can honestly say that it's better than In n Out. Many people think I'm crazy and I think it's because they have so much West Coast pride that they don't want to admit it or if it's because I'm sick of In n Out all together. Either way, I must say Shake Shack is oh so divine. Yes, it's not as cheap as In n Out, but their potato buns are so soft, the patties are juicy, different toppings to choose from and it's just delicious.   Does In n Out have mushrooms? No. Does In n Out have bacon? No. Does In n Out have beer and wine? Nope.  The first time I tried Shake Shack was in New York, we fell in line for over 30 minutes and it was definitely worth it! Thank God, amen, alleluia they opened one in Las Vegas and Los Angeles!  My favorite hands down is the Shack burger with bacon! Plus, this place serves wine, hello!!! Today we tried their newest burger, the Bacon Cheddar Shack burger. It was pretty good.  I can't stop drooling about Shake Shack. I wish they would open one in Orange County, it wouldn't even be a competition to In n Out.",

    "text": "Yummy! This place has amazing burgers in Las Vegas!   We were looking forward to trying something different while visiting our trip to Vegas. We are tired of eating the same burger joints in our area such as In N Out and The Habit. Since we stayed nearby at New York New York Hotel, we decided to come here for dinner time. There was a long line when we enter, but the line moved quickly. It was very crowded when we dine in. There was plenty of seats outside if you can't find a table inside.   Shake Shack is located downstairs outside of The Strip where T Mobile Arena is. It was a close walk. They have a few menu to choose from.   {Foods} SmokeShack Shack Stack ShackBurger Fries Double Down Fries  The burger tasted good and freshly made. It is interesting that they serve it with potato bun. You won't find anywhere else for that. Pretty decent price for what you pay for. I think it is better than In N Out in my opinion.  {Service} The cashier lady was patience. They give you the buzzer when your food is ready.   I haven't had their frozen custard yet, but will try it out next time for sure.",

Not nearly enough for a place that does this kind of volume  Overall, this place was alright. I honestly can't see myself going out of my way to come back.

    "text": "MAJOR TOURIST TRAP ALERT!!! So yes, for those familiar with Shake Shack you can find many locations within New York and all over the East Coast...us West Coast peeps don't have this CHAIN RESTAURANT. So of course, we want to try it out...  I can appreciate the burger is made with quality ingredients (no hormones in their beef) but as far as flavor and taste of the burger goes, there's much left to be desired! Even with their \"Shack Sauce\" it was very plain tasting and could have been seasoned a lot better.  I had the signature \"Shake Stack\" (single patty cheese burger with fried portebello mushrom) and the \"Smoke Shack\" (bacon cheese burger)...and although both burgers tasted just fine...it was lacking that punch to make me go OMG...very overhyped in my humble opinion!   Price-wise...well I think Shack Shack is popular because you're not gonna find many places that will serve you anything for under $10 on the Las Vegas Strip! The burgers at Shack Shack range from $7-$10 (depending on what kind and how many patties you get). However, the size of the burger was disappointing as I finished the Smoke Shack burger in a couple bites. For the Smoke Shack (single patty), Shack Stack, and an order of fries...I spent $21!! In this case, I rather would pay a lot less to eat at In N Out or pay a couple extra dollars to eat at a sit down restaurant like BURGR at Planet Hollywood or Holstein's in the Cosmo.   As an additional note, the Summerlin (also in Vegas, in the Summerlin neighborhood) location has a lower rating then the Strip location...like I said...TOURIST TRAP!   Shake Shack didn't live up to the hype in my opinion and as a True California kid...I rather have In n Out or Habit Burger if we want to talk chain restaurants!  Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Life Advice - Keep in mind where New York New York Casino is...take an UBER or a CAB because it's a LONG walk from the majority of the casinos on the Strip. Not the business on a hot day!!!",

    "text": "Came here for a lunch double-date with my Vegas favs. Located in the New York New York hotel, Shake Shack has their own entrance from the strip. If you love burgers Shake Shack is a good fairly-inexpensive spot to check out while visiting Vegas. There was a line when we went, but it is definitely worth trying at least once.    Between the four of us, we ordered 2 single Shack Burgers ($5.29/each), 2 Shack Stacks ($9.59/each) and 2 orders of Fries ($2.99/each) to share. After ordering and paying at the cashier, we got pagers that would notify us when our orders were ready. While we waited, we grabbed our condiments and found a nice booth to sit down at. The seats here are first come, first serve.   The one thing that really stood out to me was the potato bun that these burgers are served on. My Shack Stack came with everything you would find in a cheeseburger (burger patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato) with the addition of a shroomburger patty, a crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese and shack sauce!! For any mushroom lovers, I definitely recommend this burger!! It was unique and delicious. We all really liked the fries, almost in an unexpected way since I usually don't like crinkle cut fries. Their fries here were nice and crispy.   I feel like the burger at Shake Shack is better than your average burger, but definitely not as good as a gourmet burger. The prices are a bit high for such a standard choice and the wait deters me from considering a return in the near future. I might go to their California location if it's convenient, but there are many alternate options for me to explore in Vegas before paying this place a second visit.",

When I saw there was a location in Las Vegas, my mind was already made up. I knew where I was going to be eating lunch on one of the days even thought I had it - twice - about a month or two prior.   This location is outside of New York, New York in what is known as \"The Park\" area. It is next to Bruxie & Tom's Urban. If you are on the strip, you cannot miss it.   The place was like a very well oiled machine. You are in the line as soon as you walk through the main entrance. There is an employee managing the line and answering questions. They also make sure customers are heading to the registers as soon as one becomes available to keep the line moving. There is a big menu board to look at while you are in line with prices and calories.  We ordered with a friendly employee at her register. We got our beer order first. Then, we waited for our food. While waiting, we saw how crazy good the employees were at their job! There were a ton of them, and they were getting food out quickly! If someone came to the counter to complain or ask for something, they were quick to resolve the problem or get the items customers needed. I was definitely amazed.  And our food? It was great! It was just as I remembered and the reason I had to go to this location when I heard about it!",

The menu is quite large and it can be hard to choose from all the goodies.  I ordered a single ShackBurger and a small Abita root beer.  After paying, I was handed a pager and we went to secure a table.  The only table available was close to the entrance where the cold wind would blow in as people came and went.   After a short wait, our food was ready for pick up at the counter.  The burger was delicious.  Each bite was better than the last.  The ShackSauce was savory with an umami note.  The Abita root beer was really tasty.  It's made with Louisiana cane sugar and spring water in Louisiana.  I would try other items on the menu next time I get to visit but since we had eaten earlier in the evening, I only wanted a late night snack.  Shake Shack is the real deal.",

    "text": "Meal #4 of 2017 Las Vegas Trip  There's a reason this place is called Shake Shack. You don't go here for a meal. You go here for custard. Okay, wait my reasoning is flawed since \"shake\" is in the name. What I'm getting at is that this place should be called Custard Shack or at least it should be related to dairy desserts in some way.  I remembered the burger being overhyped so I decided to try the classic hot dog instead. That was more disappointing. FRENCH'S mustard? Are you fucking kidding me? And then the whole thing fell apart about one third of the way in. There was too much moisture from the relish wetting the bottom bun, when it should have been on top. Also, serving it in a wrapper would have helped.  The manager went table to table to check on customers, and was nice to bring my daughter a new bun for her burger that fell apart. (I sense a bun structural integrity problem.)  The crinkle cut fries were really good. As I mentioned the real reason to go to Shake Shack is the frozen custard. I think plain vanilla is better to taste the frozen custard flavor. We had their Shark Attack - chocolate custard with mix-ins (I don't remember which ones now). But at Shake Shack chocolate really just tastes like frozen yogurt so everyone should know to get the vanilla, which I've had in New York and was fantastic.

My only complaint is that the associates taking orders sometimes seem distracted. I once had someone not make eye contact the entire time I was placing an order - no bueno. Other than that, good job Shake Shack!",

So this was my place to hit up in Vegas this time, since the last two trip we came up short. I might have to give Shake Shack a slight edge over IN & Out burgers due to the fact that their burgers patties are more juicy and well season then IN &Out and plus they serve \"BEER\".  What was ordered: Shack Stack Burger: Cheeseburger w/Shroom Burger lettuce and tomato and Shacksauce. Man what a great combination. The patty was perfectly cook and season and the portobello was battered and fried to perfection. For $9 yes it pretty pricey , but it's good.   Shack Burger: Cheeseburger w / Lettuce and Tomato and Shacksauce. Delicious!   Fries: This was ok. IN&OUT fries are still better and made fresh.  Yeah I'm definitely a fan of Shake Shack and can't wait until they open up one down here in southern California soon.",

I've only had this place once and I'll have to wait until the one in LA opens to try it again, but my first experience at this location was so good. Had to stop by when we were in Vegas. I've heard so much about this place and just had to judge for myself.  Along with burgers, they also serve hot dogs, frozen custards, and alcohol!  Came in on a weekday afternoon. There was a bit of a line, but it went super fast! We ordered the Shack burger, Shack Stack burger, fries, 50/50, and mango lemonade. I gobbled up my Shack burger quickly, it was so good. I liked the soft hamburger bun and juicy cheesy patty. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but I did have a bite of the Shack Stack and liked it! I especially loved the tasty muenster cheese, I started dipping my fries in it when I got the chance ;] The crinkle cut fries were crispy and delicious. I will for sure try the cheese fries next time.  The woman who took our order was really friendly. She noticed my boyfriend's taiko jacket and started small talk about taiko :) Also, somebody came around to ask customers if they needed anything.  Can't wait for the LA location to open.",

I took out my platinum card and cut the line and these people looked at me confused and got mad cause I got to order before everyone. Lol it was a busy day. Came here on a Saturday weekend before the fourth for lunch with my friend Shannon. I ordered the cheeseburger the fries with a chocolate milkshake. Everything was delicious and I loved the cheeseburger. The fries was delicious as well. I like this place better than in n out because the fries at Shake Shack is definitely better than the fries at In N out. The burger had good amount of cheese on it as well and the bread was soft. I definitely will hit this place up for my burgers cravings from now on.",

Tables inside are always full and there's always a line. So if you can, try mobile ordering instead. The app seems to be automatic when it sends you the text about your order being ready at the time that you picked for pick up. The restaurant is so busy that your meal probably isn't ready, but they'll prioritize your order if you go inquire about the pick up. Still beats waiting in that long line to order and then have to wait for it to be made. There's also free 1 hour parking at the NYNY.  If it's your first time, get the Shroom Burger. It's good enough to make you want to be vegetarian!",

Cost about around $23 or so.   I'd always recommend this place to the burger fan. If your hungry I'd order a double patty or two separate burgers because they are kind of small.

    "text": "First heard about Shake Shack while in New York 2 years ago and I finally got to try it in Vegas, of all places.  Stopped by just after the lunch hour on a Saturday.  Place was pretty busy with football games playing on all the tvs.  We went to stand in line to place our order.  Line moved quickly and we were able to find a seat at one of the communal tables.  The burgers took a bit longer than a typical fast food joint.  They give you a buzzer and you get up and pick up the tray at the counter.  Even though the buzzer went off, it still took an additional few minutes to get our tray.    So my thoughts on the ShackBurger?  Pretty damn good.  Its a pretty typical smaller cheeseburger w/lettuce, tomato and then there's that ShackSauce.  That's what makes the burger.  Don't know what's in it, but I could see myself craving it.    Cheddar Bacon Fries-Another standard favorite, but the fries were crispy and the cheese and bacon were better quality.  Glad they have a couple of these in LA, because I will need to make a repeat visit.",

The line was almost out the door, but moved quickly to order (about 10 minutes!), put in our order and the person behind the counter said 5-10 minutes. WHAT? For comparison, two salads were ordered at Bruxie for the same time and it took longer than the 11 burgers/dogs/fries/etc.   I ordered the peanut butter shake, shake stack, and cheese fries. All were very delicious, but very pricey - this was probably about ~$20, steep for a meal for one person!   - Shake stack - A burger that has a patty and fried portebello mushroom oozing with sauce and cheese. I shared this and this was a lot! It was delicious, perfect for soaking up the alcohol that was drank/will be drank, but definitely greasy and heavy. I guess I would not recommend if you're trying to look skinny for day club. $9.29 - would get again only if sharing again. - Cheese Fries - the cheese sauce was yummy! But also not sure if I like crinkle fries personally. ($3.50..?) - Peanut butter shake - get this if you like peanut butter ($5.25..?)  If I am near a Shake Shack and my friends wanted to go or in this case everyone is too drunk/tired to go get food so we went out to get it all to bring it back to the hotel room so everyone could survive the rest of the night - yes, I would be down for some cheesy ooey mushroom goodness. Definitely would not go out of my way for this burger and would probably choose In-N-Out for price and convenience, but coming from California I would not have to go out of my way for In-N-Out either since they're located everywhere!  Would recommend for the hype.",

    "text": "The debate of In N Out vs Shake shack. I'm not sure if my expectations were just high, or it really just didn't satisfy my tastebuds. Well, at least not the burger. I ordered the double shack burger, and it was not what I was hoping it would be. We also ordered the double down fries.   The service was ok, employees didn't seem happy, the lady that took our order actually deleted my whole burger once I saw the receipt. This was due to me asking for no tomatoes, and she didn't realize she 86'd the whole burger. We also found a table but we had to wipe it off ourselves, even though there was an employee standing next to it just surveying the area. Looked around and there were actually 5 dirty tables around us.   Starting off with the burger, it wasn't anything too special. The bun was just a potato bun which was too soft and soggy, the meat was very salty. It seemed like a burger you can get at any other restaurant that serves burgers. At least with In N Out, you can say that you can't really find that anywhere else. Especially due to the toasted bun. It was also quite greasy, and left me feeling bleh.   But I give it the extra stars for the fries. The fries came loaded with cheese, bacon, and peppers. The fries had a nice crunch to it, and I actually really enjoyed them.   So to end the debate in my own perspective, In n out over Shake Shack.",

    "text": "I've been waiting for the day where I would be able to enjoy the East Coast's most hyped burger. A few weeks ago, that day arrived. I could finally toss my opinion in on the \"Battle of the Burgers\" - In n Out vs. Shake Shack.  I grabbed their basic cheeseburger, the crinkle fries and a water. I did not want to allow one of their tasty (and damn, they are tasty) shakes, custard, or a 32oz beer to cloud the flavors of the burger and fries.   Well, the burger was solid. I'd rate it higher than Five Guys and most other burger joints. It tasted clean and by clean I mean, not a greasy-bun-destroying-mess. In-n-Out wins this one.  The fries were alright. I'm not a crinkle fry kind of guy, but I respect the fry they put out. In-n-Out takes the fries title, too.  After I thoroughly demolished my burger and fry, I ordered a 32oz beer. It was Brooklyn Brewing's special Shake Shack ale. I've had Brooklyn's offerings before and this was par for the course. Nothing mind blowing, but a pretty damn serviceable offering. I enjoyed the beer in my collectable mug as I strolled the Strip. In-n-Out doesn't have beer, so props to Shake Shack on this one.  I got tastes of both an incredible shake and their well-known custard. Both were winners to me.   OH and the chicken sandwich looked world class. Might grab one of those instead of a burger next time I hit up the Shack in Vegas.",

Bf says the shake is better than in and out so they get one star but when it comes to a overall review this is a burger joint so let's rate the burgers. Wait...first I must complain about the seating...there wasn't enough. Lol. Onto the burgs. We both ordered the shake burger, I ordered it with everything he ordered plain. We got cheese fries which were not that great. I don't like nacho cheese so perhaps that spoiled my expectations. Even my bf who loves velveeta and American cheese didn't care for the cheese fries. So now you know we both gave the shake shack a thumbs down. Once again Cali based In and Out has our vote on best burger. Updated review. Bf told me to add that there is zero provision for grilled onions at the SS. There is no ice for water and there is not a soda dispenser at your whim.",

My friend and I walked from the Venetian to NYNY to have Shake Shack.  When we arrived it was around 1pm and the line was out the door. I have to say the place was pretty good.  I ordered a single burger, fries, and a black/white shake.  The burger was good but seemed a little small. The next time I will probably go with a double.  The fries were good as well. I really like the crinkle cut fries. I think you need to get these with the cheese sauce though.   The black/white shack was absolutely delicious. One of the best shakes I have ever had. Yummy.  Anyways I have to say the place is really good. I would definitely be back again...",

The cheese fries were pretty good. Nice change with the crinkle fries and not greasy or soggy, but they use the pre-melted cheese. Might be better if it was real cheese.  Got the cranberry lemonade and it was really good BUT the cup was so small.  The hugest negative was how crowded it was. So difficult to get a table. Pretty much have to prey upon people as they finish their food to guarantee you can get a seat inside. Sitting outside wouldn't be bad during the warmer days but I came during the winter so an inside seat was a must.   Not bad food but you will spend a lot. Thanks but I'll stick to my In n Out.",

    "text": "Dope-ass burgers, yo.  Definitely one of the best fast-food burgers I've ever had. Eat your heart out In-N-Out. I was in Vegas for 3 days and I ate there twice and I'd have totally gone again, even though it was about a 30-40 minute walk from our hotel on the strip.  Cool vibe and delicious everything. The one criticism I have is that the menu isn't visible from the order counter. The menu is beside the queue where you wait to place your order, so you'd better decide what you want and remember it by the time you get to the front (remembering things in a, shall we say, compromised Vegas state of mind can be challenging at times).  The crinkle fries are delicious. I really liked them with the cheese on top.   Highly recommended. It's quintessential Vegas over-indulgence, but at an affordable price in an approachable atmosphere. This should be on your must-visit list when in Vegas, especially if you live on the West coast!",

The beef patty is a good portion, juicy, and beefy goodness full of flavor. The opposite of other spots rubber patties full of glue. The #cheese and sauce ratio is great and the produce is fresh. Plus the menu has great variety and quality options across the board. Love this place.",

I very much liked their house ale, which was easy to drink and a lot better than some bud light.  Vegas prices are ridiculous.  I'd feel like these prices were at least twice as high and maybe even three times higher than they should be.  In-N-Out is better.  Five Guys is worse.  The Habit is about equal.",

    "text": "This is coming from a devoted In-N-Out fan - why do people continue to compare the two burger empires? The only thing to compare is their respective cult followings. That's it. As far as comparing the actual food, there is no contest. I tried each chain's burgers and fries back-to-back and Shake Shack's burger was clearly superior. The overall flavor is much better and their burgers even look more appetizing. I also like their potato buns A LOT more than In-N-Out's dry, flavorless buns (I always order protein style for this reason). I can't say I'm ready to kick In-N-Out to the curb because, let's be honest, a lot of this has to do with nostalgia, however, I'm giving the crown to the Shack.  The first time I tried Shake Shack (Shackburger), I thought it was good, but not better than In-N-Out. I was going based on my fond memories and how much I enjoy their food. I concluded that both burgers were good in their own ways and that I could enjoy both separately. A month later, I had the opportunity to try their burgers again (Double Shackburger, Shackmeister, Shack Stack) and I couldn't believe how good it tasted! It solidified my thoughts about the quality of their burgers. That same evening, I visited the nearby In-N-Out and much to my surprise, their burger looked a lot less appetizing than I remembered (especially compared to Shake Shack). And all it took was one bite - I couldn't believe the vast difference in taste!  It was flavorless. It reminded me how much I dislike their buns. I did, however, enjoy the tangy-ness of In-N-Out's secret sauce.   I still need to figure out what I like best at Shake Shack. I like raw onion on my burger and I have yet to order a burger with it, so that'll be my next visit. I like their natural crinkle cut fries, the Cheese Fries were really good, and their shakes and Concretes are tasty as well. The prices are a little high and the location makes it difficult to want to visit often, but the food makes it worthwhile.",

I've been to the original one in New York a couple years ago, so when I heard Shake Shack was opening in Vegas, I knew I had to stop by during my Vegas trip last January.  We headed straight to NYNY after the Super Bowl.  I was expecting a long line, but when we got there, there was only about 10 people in front of us.  You could see they had the rope out the door as the line gets pretty long during peak hours/weekends.   I made the mistake of not trying the Shack Stack when I was in NY.  I was going to get it this time. It's a cheeseburger with a fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, and their yummy ShackSauce.  The verdict? Heaven!  My boyfriend took the second bite and steaming cheese oozed out and burnt his tongue lol.  And of course we had to get a side of their crinkle cheese fries  It is a bit pricey for burgers.  $7-$10 for a burger, and that doesn't include fries and a drink.  Still worth it, though!  And this place is pretty popular for its frozen custard shakes as well. They also sell hot dogs, beer and wine, and dog treats!  As said in my Shake Shack NY review, I can't really compare this place to In N Out.  Both are unconditionally delicious.  I still love both equally the same!",

    "text": "Seriously, this branch was better than the one i had in NY (near times square)  When I first tried shake shack for the first time in NY I wasn't really impressed. I decided to give it another shot and I'm so glad I did. I cant even put into words. SO AMAZING.   It was BOGO shake day too (in celebration of valentine's day)   The only complaint I have is the service. We asked for the shack stack with no cheese and the cashier said he couldn't do it which is fine because the mushroom patty had cheese in it. So we asked if we could get a regular burger with no cheese and he said no. I don't understand that logic because - isn't it just a slice of cheese on a burger .. that you omit ?   Whatever - this place is too bomb to let that matter. I'll be back! So glad they made one on the west coast!",

    "text": "I can understand the hype but its really nothing special to me. We got here pretty early so we didnt have to wait at all  Got the portabello mushroom burger which was good but its not something I would crave later in life. A little too cheesy for my taste and I love cheese but I guess i dont love it that much!.   Fries are ok. Cheese fries have nacho cheese which I would just prefer with chips and not on fries. Again, my own preference.   What really got under my skin....was the staff.  Ok so my friend orders a shake stack, fries and a lemonade. All of our orders were coming out and hers was taking a bit. She goes up to the counter and it looks like someone else just took her order. The staff goes to the table where her order was and takes the food from that party and comes back and says \"Here you go\" to my friend. ummmmmmm.....ok i understand that the food wasnt eaten yet but it was sitting at another table. Restaurant etiquette 101: YOU DO NOT GIVE SOMEONES ORDER TO SOMEONE ELSE AND THEN RETURN IT TO THEM AND EXPECT THEM TO BE OK WITH IT!  YOU MAKE THEM A NEW ORDER.   My Friend complains and the manager comes and asks whats wrong with the order. My friend tells her the situation and the manager replies with..\"Oh you can take that one\". Yea, NO.   They finally got the point and made her a new order, which they brought over to our table so was still questionable if it was a new one or if they just walked to the back and pretended to bring out a fresh order.   Sorry shake shack.....Training of staff and management goes a long way. Just FYI.",

    "text": "Dubbed as the \"In & Out of the East Coast\", I have had Shake Shack when I visited New York. This time, I had my nephews with me in Vegas for them to have a taste of the East Coast. It's much larger and spacious compared to the locations I've been in New York. It gets busy, but the line gets by fast and the wait time for the food was about 10 minutes. We ordered the Shakeshack burger, Smokeshack burger, Hot dog, Crinkle Fries, and their milkshakes.  Food: Shack burger is like a classic cheeseburger with buns, patty, lettuce, tomato, and cheese with their shack sauce spread. The goodness and quality of the burger gave it a thumbs up. If you're indecisive on which to try out, you can't go wrong with originality for the Shack burger.  Smokeshack burger was what my nephew had. He liked it, but would rather try out Shackburger for a more colorful topping in his burger with the lettuce and tomatoes. Perfect for bacon lovers!  Hot dog was basic. Hot and grilled with the hot dog split open at the center, I can't say much since my nephew likes his hot dog plain, naked, and boring.  Fries: Crispy, toasted fries which were good but may be basic for some. Some like theirs with cheese added, I preferred mine plain.  Milkshakes: I had the Black and White as recommended by the staff as their popular pick and I liked it. It wasn't too thick that I can't slurp like the ones I had from In and Out. My nephew had vanilla for his and enjoyed it as well.  Verdict: Pretty good for a fast food, comparable to In & Out with their food made with quality. As a California girl, In & Out is just as good as Shake Shack that I can't compare the two. Both have their goodness in different ways. In & Out caters more of a classic menu with their not so secret menus. Shake Shack offers a little more variety to their burgers and shakes, also selling alcohol at this location. In & Out's prices are more affordable than Shake Shack. In & Out's burger sells an average of $3, while the Shack Burger goes for $5, and the Smokeshack was close to $7. ShakeShack's shakes costs a little more than the Shack burger itself. Would I have it again? I would, if I happen to be in town since there's no Shake Shack in the Bay Area.",

    "text": "Lived up to its expectation!  Since I've heard of this place, I've been wanting to try a Shack stack-- cheeseburger topped with a fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese. Despite the unattractive 770 calories, this burger really fills you up! And when are you going to be able to try it again anyway? I'm not exactly from NY. My favorite part of the burger was the mushroom, wouldn't have minded if it lacked a fried exterior. Wasn't a fan of the cheese on the burger since the mushroom had melted cheese already, but with so many patrons, it's time consuming for them to customize or substitute items unless you have a food allergy. It's nice that their menu asks you to inform them of any allergies right away. Customer dedication at its best. The employee standing outside the front glass door letting people in was friendly and asks if it's your first time dining there prior to making jokes about it not being all that great. Line moves fast.   *Crinkle cut fries were good, not overly salty, and are a fun wavy shape.  *Tried a single scoop of frozen chocolate custard, maybe I should've tried vanilla instead. It's definitely thicker and creamier than regular ice cream; it tasted like rocky road to me, almost like the chocolate ice cream and marshmallows were melted and mixed together, minus the almonds.  *Water cups and fountain are past the pick up area toward the middle. Refill as many times as you like.   *Line/window C outside on the left allows you to order non-hot items such as frozen custard, shakes, fountain drinks, beer, and memorabilia (T-shirts, etc.). I got the black viva Las Vegas sign/Shake Shack shirt for $18.   I'll be back in the future.",

Of course you know I ordered a Chocolate Malt with my Burger & Fries (Crinkle Cut action!). Everything tasted really fresh and delicious. The place reminds me more of TrueBurger (Oakland) than In N Out...and they're all good in my book, plus different in their own unique ways. Shake Shack is a little more pricey than In N Out, though, so there's that. But I'd come here again in a heartbeat.   ALSO: don't let the seemingly long line out the door fool you. They move people through that line real fast. We only waited about 15 minutes before it was our turn to order, and the food came out quickly too.   I'm a fan.",

I get sick of burgers fairly quick so half way through the meal I gave up. Definitely a first and a last for me. It's good just not something I'd crave for whenever I'm in Vegas. There's tons of other places I rather eat. Plus the wait for the burgers were really long. If I'm getting a burger I'd expect it to come out quicker. If wasn't like I ordered a steak or anything.",

I went with the Smoke Shack and fries. We were waiting for everyone in our party of 6 to get our food, which actually took longer than expected. They had switched one of my friend's numbers, so she wasn't called until she had to go up to them and ask what happened. She was then given her burger as well as an extra side of fries, so that was nice.  The food itself was smaller than I originally thought. Maybe it was because the Smokeshack didn't have any lettuce in it, or maybe it was because we were ravenous after having bouldered during the day in Red Rocks, or maybe it was due to the wait. In any case, I finished that small burger in like six bites, and it still left more to be desired. The fries were great, though, and I wish they came in bigger sizes too. Perhaps this is a good place to go to after having had some drinks, or maybe I just needed to get a double instead of a single. Either way, the place was solid A-Ok, but definitely didn't live up to the hype for me.",

    "text": "My husband and I were planning to find gelato at Monte Carlo, but on our walk from NYNY to Monte Carlo, we saw this new place and was attracted by the fact that they use hormone/antibiotics free beef for burger, so we changed course and decided to try this place instead of getting gelato.   We went around dinner time at night on a Tuesday and it was packed. Long line, a lot of occupied tables. I had the double hamburger, my husband got a single hamburger, and we shared a concrete (vanilla frozen custard with strawberry puree). I like the burger a lot. I specifically asked them if they cook the patty with nut oil or soy oil and they said no, so it is awesome for me due to my allergy. And I also didn't get the shack sauce as there is soy in it. I like the burger as it is simply beef flavor. I am actually the type who don't like too many things going on making me not tasting the beef. I eat beef for liking the beef taste, not the condiment. So I like the way they do it, fits my need. And the burger is a bit greasy which I have no problem with, I like beef patty having the beef fat taste, I hate those that has plant oil taste. It is just my preference and they happened to fit my need. I also can tell the difference in taste for hormone free beef and conventional beef. I don't like the taste of the beef that was raised with hormones or antibiotics. So another reason I like the taste of shake shack burger.  We both like the concrete, the dairy tasted fresh and soft, the texture was good, the creaminess was right, good consistency, I was so glad that I had this instead of gelato.   I know I can probably make the same quality of beef patty at home as long as I go to Whole Foods to get the hormone free or even organic beef. But honestly, when you eat out, the reason is that you don't have time to cook or even do dishes, or you are on the street being hungry and need to be fed right away. So I can't say that it is not special because I could probably make the same thing at home. The price is not bad too. And I got to eat the way I want without cleaning all the grease splattering around my stove and countertop. And I don't think I have the stamina to make fresh ice cream daily myself too though I am capable. So yah, I recommend this place if you are like me who don't eat conventional beef or dairy. I like every bite I had here.   A note for people who have allergy. Their fries are made with just potato, no additives, but fried in soy oil, so if you have soy allergy, don't do fries then. The hot dog is also made with hormone free, antibiotic free meat, and there is no nitrite or nitrate, we are gonna try the hot dog next time when we are around the area. If you have allergy, tell the cashier so he/she can tell you what items you shouldn't try.",

The smokehouse burger was packed full of flavor and didn't leave me feeling weighed down or tired. The shake had a lot of flavor. The fries, not so much. They could have had a little more flavor.   I recommend eating here.",

Sometimes a coupla small squishy burgers hits the late night fast food-hangover cure jonesin' spot. So if that's what you're craving, head to Rally's. At least your wallet will thank you.",

    "text": "Went to New York and wanted to try Shake Shack, Unfortunately I was unable to go as the time just flew by! Now I have Shake Shack right in town! So naturally I had to try them out!  I had the Shack Stack, reg fries, a Shake of the week (s'mores), and since we went on Super Bowl sunday and awesome 50% off deal of the roadie with the Brew made especially for Shake Shack. The beer was called the ShackMeister Ale. I really do not like Ales at all but this stuff?! This I can drink lol! Very smooth and light tasting, a perfect compliment to the great burgers! Now the fries, the crinkle cut fries! They were delicious, crisp, crunchy, and awesome crinkle cut fries! The S'mores shake was an awesome blend with a chocolate base with marshmallows and bits, tasted great and I was a little sad when I finished it lol! Now the burgers! The Shack Stack is Their Burger with a crips fried portable mushroom stuffed with cheese! Wow!! It was awesome, the first bite is an explosion of cheese, mushroom, and burger! All blend so well and compliments each other with great balance. The Bun is soft and slightly chewy (awesome) and the bun is still connected on one side so all the burger, toppings, mushroom doesn't just go all over the place, Well thought out. It seems to be a very hip place to be I mean it is right there on the strip bringing in a lot of people which is a good thing! I hope Shake Shack stays for a very long time as I will return to try out their other options. Thank you for coming to vegas and giving us the Shake Shack!",

The fries are okay, nothing special but the burgers are soooo amazing. I don't even like burgers and I love their burgers.   The location is packed constantly and takes a long time to order so that sucks. As a Vegas resident and not a visitor spending all my time on the strip it can be hard to get to. Having to park and go through the hotel is a bit much but the food is worth it. I would suggest definitely eating in to Beth the experience and savor the flavor.",

    "text": "We meet again after 3 years, my NYC In-N-Out esque friend :D. I was on a tight schedule to get out of Las Vegas and wanted something quick before hopping on the 15 back to LA. This did not disappoint, but I'm reserving a raving review for when I try more of the menu.  My order: basic single shack burger, fries, and a scoop of the custard. 1.  Maybe its my Californian blood talking but I still prefer In-N-Out's fries. They were crispy enough here, but the price is higher and they seemed to get colder easily. When In-N-Out's fries are freshest they are super hot, crispy, and airy on the inside, which their fries were not by the end of my meal. 2. I may have to give it to these guys on the burger. The bun had a mellower, chewier taste that I loved, kinda reminiscent of asian bakery breads/Hawaiian sweet rolls. The patty was more substantial and juicier. The cheese/lettuce/etc was forgettable, but that's always True. Some regrets about not getting the bacon burger or the mushroom stacked one though! 3. I'll pass on the custard next time. I could be turning into an ice cream snob, but very few ice cream places impress me outside of hagan daz and liquid nitrogen places like Creamistry.  Price: for an order of 3 single shack burgers, 2 fries, and a custard it was 27 bucks. It's more than I'm used to paying for burgers but I'm going to chalk it up to the Las Vegas prices. I swear even the Starbucks was more here than in LA.  Service/Atmosphere:  Very efficient for a long ass line! I was initially confused as to why the door was closed and people were waiting outside, but soon realized that it was because the line snaked out the door already at 12pm on a Monday. There was an employee outside though that made small talk with us as she managed the crowds, which made waiting in the increasing heat bearable.  The menus are posted in large print while you're in the lines so you can decide. Their buzzer system is great because you can snag a seat and chat while you wait instead of obsessively listen for numbers. The water, ketchup, etc, is centrally located and kept clean. The cleanup workers were also super sweet! A lady walked around our area looking to help patrons clear out their dishes to the trash as they are done eating.   I'll be back when this hits soCal next year :)",

Steak Stack was all the rage with my group so I went with it, and the cheese stuffed portabella was cooked to perfection but I felt guilty as sin eating the deep-fried monstrosity it was. The cheese didn't seem to add anything to the burger and I found it made it too salty and somewhat disgusting towards the end.   The cheese fries are nothing special, and looks like something you can make at home with some Whiz and freezer fries. Do not get cheese fries if you get the Steak Stack; cheese overload.   Had the malted caramel shake which was the special shake of the day, but it was again, mediocre. Once again I got the feeling I could make this shake better at home quite easily....it was overly sweet with the flat texture of a McDonald's milkshake. Needed water to choke it down and I left at least 1/3 in there by the time we left.   Mediocre food plus hiked up prices makes me avoid this place easily on the next trip.

I was actually in Austin last week and a Shake Shack had just opened there a couple days before and the line was insane, like at least 100 people deep, so I decided not to go.  Thankfully, the line wasn't so bad in Vegas.  I'm not sure if this version is as authentic or as good as the ones in NY, but at least I got to try to the West Coast casino version of it, lol.  The shakes are aight, the fries aren't bad, but the burgers are very good.  As good as In-N-Out?  Nah, but it wasn't too far off.  I would say that if you like Five Guys, then this is more for you.  It has a very Five Guys feel regarding the grease and the meat.  I do like it more than Five Guys--there's a bit more going on and more flavor.  The fries are also pretty good (better than Five Guys and perhaps In-N-Out).  Overall, I'd come back.  Would I make a trip out of it?  Probably not.",

Wayy too chocolately.  - Secret Sauce: tastes of pickles... I hate pickles. So this was definitely a personal thing, but ruined the burger for me.

The quality of the patty is equivalent to the patties used by some restaurants which sell $15+ burgers, and they have the taste to back it up.  The only downside is the size. The burgers are pretty small. If you're an average-sized guy, one wouldn't fill you up. I guess the good thing about that is it leaves room for some shake and fries. However, I would still pick shake shack over In-N-Out any day of the week. This is coming from someone who lives in California, the home of In-N-Out.",

Hubby wanted a more traditional burger so we opted for Shake Shack. Plus, we've been wanting to try the Shake Shack in NYC and were excited to see that there was now one open in Vegas.  We got there and the line was almost out the door. We probably waited for about 20 minutes to place our order. I ordered the ShackBurger with cheese and a Chocolate Malted Shake. Hubby got some special burger with crispy onions and a special sauce (i think?) and a coffee shake. We shared an order of the cheese crinkle fries.  The place was filled with large TVs so the hubby was able to watch his sports while we waited. Food came in about 15-20 minutes. I took my first bite and thought it was really good...not sure if it was because it was around 2PM and I was starving. But after a few more bites I realized that I wasn't impressed. It wasn't a bad burger by any means but it wasn't a great burger. My shake was lacking something as well, didn't taste creamy enough for me. Hubby was very disappointed with his burger as well, especially his coffee shake. He did like the fries though, but I, on the other hand, wasn't feeling their special cheese sauce. We both agreed that both In N Out and Five Guys were much better.   Maybe it tastes better in NYC?",

We quickly grabbed a seat at the communal table and waited for our food. Really the star of the this meal was the burger! Bun is soft, condiments are good, but it's really the meaty flavor of the burger that won me over. Dare I say I prefer the Shackburger to my beloved In-&-Out? I might just say that!

I got the shackburger which is a regular cheeseburger. If I had to choose between in&out and shake shack, I would probably choose in&out. The buns at in&out are nicely toasted where as Shake shacks buns are soft. I guess it's preference. The shakes are amazing! I sampled my friends and all of them were thick, creamy, and just great. I also tried the cheese fries, which was also pretty good as well. They were crinkled cut fries with artificial tasting nacho cheese melted all over. Overall, it was a decent meal and the environment is cool too! We got to watch the games a giant screen while enjoying burgers",

I forgot about that until after I had ordered and just got the one cheese burger plus the shroom patty. Still good, but I like that extra meat.  Overall I do enjoy the burgers here, and highly recommend. If your like me, and enjoy more meat on your burger, try ordering the double cheeseburger plus the shroom patty, it's not on the menu.

It was nothing spectacular and there weren't fireworks on my tongue haha I have gone to the one in central park in new york and I remember that one being real good. So, I was very excited when I heard one had opened here!   When I looked at the menu, it was similar to that of new york. The average price of a burger is 6-10$. The shakes are around 5$. When I had arrived, I was expecting some what of a line but I seriously just walked right on up to the register and ordered our burgers. Some of the burgers have a shack sauce that reminded me of in n out, but this sauce is much saltier than I remember. Nothing beats the in n out secret sauce    Overall, the burgers we got basically tasted like something  that I could have concocted at home. Just cook some meat, fry some bacon, melt some cheese and voila! You have a shake shack burger. The sauce was salty and I felt it had overpowered the taste of my burger. I had to drink two cups of Dr pepper to help with it. The krinkle fries were good tho! You can't mess up potatoes! Oh, my friend got a strawberry milkshake that was OK too.   I wasn't too impressed so I may only return to see if my first experience was just bad or if a friend forces me.",

I was so wanting to like this place, but for the extra wait time and cost, the food is just so pathetically average.   THE BOTTOM LINE: Do yourself a favor and stick to In N Out. The hype on this place is off the hook, I just wish the actual food was also.",

    "text": "I wanted to see what this place was about so I decided to come here during the Fourth of July weekend. It was around 9pm and the place was still pretty busy and packed because of a holiday weekend. I ordered the smoke shack burger with a vanilla shake on the side. The service was good, we just had to wait about 20 minutes for our food, which I understand because it was a busy night. The price is high (approximately $6 for a burger, $5 for a small shake and total with tax is $15). There is limited seating, however, we got lucky and found one outside. The burger was pretty good, along with the vanilla shake. Will I be back? Maybe if I'm around the area and really craving a burger and a shake.",

The cheese on the cheese fries was gritty. The coffee shake had very little coffee flavor and tasted a little bit like dirt. Apart from the really nice and friendly staff I don't think this place has much to offer. Steer clear of this burger place and  go to one of the many other burger options on the strip.",

I got the kids some hotdogs and they really liked them. I did not try any shakes or specialty items. Be prepared to sit outside because there is very limited indoor seating and it is very busy. Enjoy that burger in 110 deg. Heat!",

I loved the fact the burger had a nice kick to it, maybe from the cherry pepper or the sauce, but wow, I was pleasantly surprised. BACON! Who doesn't love BACON in there burger.   Besides the food, the wait was short and I was able to find tables right away. The cashier was super friendly too.   I'm lactose intolerant but I had to try out the shakes, wasn't a big fan of the black&white but willing to try out more. Lets just say the bathroom was my best friend for the next day !",

    "text": "This place is legit. I am not sure if there is a better bang for your buck on the strip to be honest. I think the burger was $5.99 and a double is not much more. I have had one of each and both were great although the bun to meat/cheese ratio is better with the single. The most expensive part imo were the fries and drinks, but definitely worth getting to complete the meal. If I had to describe the burger, I would say it resembles a slightly smaller Ruby's Cheeseburger. You know, tastes like it was fried in butter or something. Whatever it is, it tastes great. Note that it's a different style burger than In-N-Out, which is amazing in its own right. Fries were crinkle cut like Del Taco, but they were better, more crispy I would say. Shakes were good too, not as good as a Ruby's shake but you wont be disappointed with the purchase.  I went twice on my last 2.5 day visit to Vegas, it was that good. In closing, this is an amazing food choice for a quick meal if you have other plans for the night.   I did not get a beer here, but they have above average choices (craft) if you need to re-energize your drunken state of mind.   Customer service was great too; the cashiers and food attendants were nice both times.  Location is right outside NY NY Casino, which is perfect for me as I hang out in the MGM - Bellagio region of the strip.   My exact meal that the review referenced was just a plain meat and cheese only burger, one time a double and the other time a single. Fries, and a Neapolitan shake were also ordered. My only complaint is they charge extra to mix flavors on the shake, which is ridiculous.  Also, can't comment on how True this is to the one in NY, as I have not been. I can vouch that I love burgers and am quite picky with them. I gladly give this the kev-dog stamp of approval and think you will enjoy this burger very much.",

After that, we still had to get the pager/buzzer thing to wait for our food. It took probably about another 15 mins. Finally, we got our food and I just got the regular Shackburger, Black and White milkshake, and french fries. Their prices are high and to be honest, I don't get the hype of this restaurant. It tastes like a plain regular burger that you could get at any other restaurant. In n Out is still way better than Shake Shack. Also, In n Out is so much cheaper! Shake Shack's burgers were very small and their buns are flat. The milkshake was pretty good though and the french fries were not too crunchy, more like hard. Although the food is okay, the service was meh. It took extremely long to get our food.",

A selection of couches, bar stools, and regular tables are provided for seating - something for everyone! The menu is displayed by the line, so that I could decide on my order before getting up to the counter. The selection of food is excellent (they even have hotdogs!) but a bit expensive. The cashier was rude and signaled us over with an abrupt wave of the arm and an unwelcoming face. The poor service was made up for by the delicious food! Flavorful, fresh, and hot. I'll be back here again.",

    "text": "Sorry burger connoisseurs out there.  This place is overrated.  I had to fly from Honolulu, to LAX to LV to try this place out and I felt like going to In-N-Out right after.  First off, I like to buy people lunch and 4 of us cost $75 (compared to me taking 10 people to InzNOutz cost $60)  I don't care much about how much a place cost but Shake Shake is way overrated in both taste and cost.  If you charge $10 bucks for a burger, I had better do cartwheels after I am done...  I had the Shack Stack - I guess it's a burger with a fried shroom and cheese.  Maybe the cook had an off day becoz the taste was just not good.  The oil may have been old...  The fries are a joke.  I gotz the Ore Ida ones with cheese and they weren't anything special.  My high school in the hoods fries were even better.  I had a chocolate - strawberry shake - sorry, LAME!  Taste like a chocolate milk, but a tad thicker.   I can make a better on in Ninja blender at home.  Plus they forgot my shake on my order...  On top of the not so good experience from this Burger Piggy, the workers there are nice but clueless.  They run around trying to complete every order correctly but there was a lot of customers coming back with missing items.  C'mon SS workers, the ordering is electronic - ain't that difficult!  I ordered 4 shakes and you gave me 3...",

The meat had good flavor like it was fresh off the grill. We also had a vanilla concrete with salted caramel sauce and this was the star of our dinner. Wow! So creamy and the salted caramel sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and salty.  Service was smiley and patient with us newbies. Quick, organized order pick up. Will definitely go back for some fries and try a shake next time!  Only complaint is that the restroom is.very.tiny. For such a big place on the strip, I think it was overlooked.

    "text": "My boyfriend vacationed in New York in early December where he was introduced to Shake Shack and fell in love and left me...just kidding!  My family and the boy took a short trip to Vegas before NYE and he found out there's a shake shack at the NYNY hotel so he dragged me there the first night we were there. I let him order the shack stack, crinkle fries, and a cranberry ginger lemonade to share since it was a midnight snack. My favorite burger place have always been In-N-Out and I can't imagine something else being more tastier and satisfying. The price is definitely pricier here, almost $10 for each burger so I had high expectations.  The interior was very nice and it was packed so I was lucky to find a table for my boy and I. Food came out about 10 minutes later and from the look of the burger, it looks really good, but I was scared to taste it just because I'm In-n-out biased.   Not much of a fan of mushrooms, but it was fried with some cheese filling so I guess that hides it. The first bite of the burger made me cry...not because the mushroom disgusted me, but because with the patty, lettuce, and everything...IT WAS ACTUALLY GOOD..like REALLY GOOD. The cheese-filled fried mushroom exploded in my mouth which gave me an instant reaction. I combined both burger and fries together for a combo bite and it literally can't get any better.  So now I'm here writing this review, crying in the inside, because for the first time I can admit that I can't be a bias for In-n-out if I fell in love with Shake Shack. The quality all around is way better for the burger AND fries; I always had a lowkey issue for in-n-out fries.  So my final statement is that if I could, I would go to shake shack overall, but since there isn't a location in California, I'll stick to In-n-out WHICH IS STILL TASTY AND SATISFYING.  Someone should petition to open a location in southern California. PLEASE. #ShakeShackCA2K16",

Their buns are nice and soft, but this just further emphasized the lack of crunch of some refreshing veggies. And the PRICE is 3-4x more than in-n-out! Their crinkle cut fries are crispy and delicious, and their shakes are pretty good too. They have a different shake featured every week.   We stopped by here twice and happened to get the same cashier both times (Kimberly). She could use a refresher in customer service skills. There were 2 other employees that were running around cleaning up tables and they were AMAZING. They were super polite and efficient and friendly!   Overall, good food and cool experience trying East coast food here. But happy to stick with in-n-out!",

We went at almost 2pm on a Monday and since we had reservations for a restaurant later that night we decided to split everything. Oh, and we didn't have any sort of line when we went.  Single shackburger - fan-freaking-tastic! Shackago dog - no poppy seed bun but still delicious none-the-less Small order of fries - so damn good! (I'm usually not one for \"crinkle\" fries but these were awesome!)  Didn't try the shake - will put on my to-do list for the next Vegas trip  I really liked the way the inside of the restaurant was set up. Had some seating areas that looked as though they would evoke conversation rather than people keeping their faces buried in their phones.  And the tables had a branding on them that said they were previously parts of a bowling lane in NY. Love the repurposed wood.  Lots of tables outside.",

Oh, I'd also say Shake Shack's cheese fries are better than In-n-Out fries, but I've always hated In-n-Out fries.

After finishing the burger, got back in line for custard. I've heard so much about their custard that I had to try it. I missed out on trying it in NY when the line was over 50 deep.  First off, huge debacle for trying to order a \"Shack Attack\" with vanilla instead of chocolate custard. I've worked fast food before and it isn't hard to ring up a substitution. Except the guy at the register had no clue what he was doing and rung it up as a create your own that cost almost $2 more.. and he wouldn't budge from it. OK, fine. I cancel that and just order a small vanilla custard.  Worst vanilla custard I have ever had. Lack of flavor or creaminess. Thought I was eating milk ice cream. I'm familiar to good custard having been introduced to Kopps & Culver's in Milwaukee. Even BurgerFi has better custard.  I came for the custard and left horribly disappointed.  2 stars for the Abita and the non-register customer service. The people cleaning the tables are as friendly as ever.",

If it allowed me, I'd give it a hundred stars for this location!  First off, if you are a Mlife platinum member you don't have to wait in the long line, luckily if you show your card at the door, you'll have your own!  Then when I got to the counter, I was greeted by an extremely nice, personable cashier named Michael.  Patient and knowledgeable about the burgers and hot dogs, he kindly took my order.  I truly wanted to tip him, but every which way, he refused to accept it!  After receiving my order from the pick up station and selecting my table, I was nicely greeted by Dorian, whom I believe was a busser perhaps.  He was extremely attentive to all the tables and was very observant towards everyone's needs!  He kept all the tables really clean and was very sincere and personable, too.  By far, there was excellent customer service overall!    Now about the food, I prefer the double meat patties, because you can really taste the freshly grilled flavor of the meat.  If you like your burger with some kick to it, there are options to accommodate your taste.  Also they're shakes are really tasty too.  If you're not full yet, which I truly doubt, you must try their extremely smooth frozen custard.  It's really delicious and yummy ending to your experience there!",

May be Shake Shack has it more juicy but taste wise, it is just the same as the rest of the burger places.

    "text": "Unreal...best burger I've ever had, hands down. Coming from a die hard Five Guys fan boy, this speaks volumes!  Had the double Shake Shack straight off the menu, no adders.  Took a bit for the order to come up, but they were busy and I don't mind waiting for quality, heck they even give you a buzzer so you know when your order's up, genius.  What stands out the most was how the melted american cheese formed a shell around the two patties, I honestly wondered the entire time I was eating how they did that.  You could tell the meat wasn't just ground beef -- come to find out its a mixture of brisket, short rib, and sirloin.  It takes great deal of pride and confidence in your burger to go that bold, and it pays off big.  This joint gains a great deal of respect from me for doing that.  The shack sauce was reminiscent of the animal sauce from In and Out, but a bit thinner, and I liked that -- not so mayonnaisey.  My best burger reality has shifted forever because of this place....",

Since everybody is comparing it to In N Out, it's WAY better than In N Out, which isn't too hard to do.  The only thing is the portions are small and it's pretty expensive.

They aren't bad, but they are about on par with Ore Ida frozen french fries.   That said, we got the Shack-a-Palooza, and it did not disappoint. The custard is wonderful. The flavor of the week was Oatmeal Creme Pie, and it was by far the best. The waffles tasted like funnel cake, which was a bit odd, but the 9 scoops of ice cream definitely took me to my happy place. I will be back for more flavors of the week.",

    "text": "Going into my dinner here at Shake Shack, I never thought anything would come close to my love for In N' Out Burger. Much to my surprise, Shake Shack came close and even surpassed In N' Out in several ways!  Service: Sorry, but In N' Out wins for service. When we arrived at Shake Shack there was a very long line, which wasn't a problem because it gave us time to discuss the menu (prominently displayed on a large wall right when you walk in). The line moved fast and soon enough it was our turn; however, the woman who took our order was ornery and short with us. B-  Decor: I LOVED the ambience and decor in Shake Shack. We snagged a spot on the large bar table in the center of the restaurant (shared by up to fifteen diners) and had a great view over the open kitchen and large flat screen TVs. I noticed couches, tables, and benches all throughout Shake Shack. A+  Food: We waited about 8-10 minutes for our food (as expected, given the large amount of people). It was well worth the wait! The burger patties were absolutely DIVINE. If you are looking for fresh and juicy, order the Shack Burger. I can't say enough good things about the patties. The only problem I had was that I asked for a lettuce-wrapped burger, and instead I got a patty on top of a slice of lettuce (making for quite a messy meal). In N' Out wins for food presentation and sauce but as much as it pains me to say it, Shake Shack has the better patty. A+  For three burgers (with added bacon), a side of fries, and a mango lemonade, it came to about $25.   Shake Shack definitely deserves the five stars.",

Ambience was ok. A lot of tables inside and outside. Bathrooms were clean. I ordered the Shake Stack burger which was actually good well maybe because it had a deep fried mushroom and i love mushrooms!  My bf ordered the ShackMeister burger (single patty $6.19) and it turned out to look like a kids burger. No wonder they offer double patty for $8.99. He wasnt very pleased with the burger, and i can understand why. He'd rather eat a Big Mac and it would be more fulfilling. We also ordered the cheese fries which was just ehh! The cheese was ok. I was expecting more of a nacho cheese.  It kinda sucks that my expectations of this place was so high and now im just bummed! :(",

    "text": "One of the items on my to do list in Vegas was to find a fun place to grab dessert. After leaving the nearby T-Mobile Arena, this seemed like the perfect place to stop (close by). We walked in the door & went to stand in line only to be told by an attendant at a completely different door that we would have to go out through that door & wait in line. The attendant at the door was letting one to two people in at a time. I felt this was kind of strange but she opened the door just far enough so we could slip past her to stand in line behind one other person. As soon as we walked out & got behind that person, she said it was ok for us to go in. Note: why not put a sign on the door leading everyone to the one door to stand in line. This was just awkward.  There was a short wait in line. We ordered a chocolate & strawberry milkshake. We waited for our order for about 5 minutes which wasn't bad for the number of people that ordered ahead of us. I was pretty disappointed at my milkshake. When you pay $6 dollars for a milkshake, I would expect them to at least fill the cup to the top. Well, they didn't. I was too tired & hungry to say anything but I was kind of annoyed.  The strawberry milkshake tasted really good so I was happy about that. And, my husband really liked his chocolate milkshake too (and his cup was filled to the top).",

We got the shack burgers and the shack stack, which were all pretty tasty, but small. For $9.49, I was expecting the Shack Stack to be enormous, but it was smaller than a regular fast food burger. The fries were nothing special, and the cheese fries were ok too.   Also, it's located on the strip so there's bound to be drunk people and reckless clubbers out. We sat next to the photo taking thing, and there was a huge crowd of obnoxious people yelling and climbing on each others back right next to our food. Thankfully none of them landed in our food.  Overall, the competition between In n Out and Shake Shack is hardly a competition. In n Out is still the reigning champ in my heart.",

I would say you do need to order at least fries on the side though if you're getting a single.

It was more expensive than what I would expect for fast food, but to try this place as a one-time experience, it wasn't disappointing. They hand you a pager that rings when your order it ready for pickup. It's pretty crowded but it took about 10 minutes to move to the front of the line.

Def not worth the $8, just get another chicken shack.",

So how was the burger from the prospective of a person who came from Texas? Actually it was pretty good. I like the style of their burger. Simple yet full of fresh ingredients, which is the key for great burgers. I also liked their fries a lot, and it would do for me. Well made burger and fries are my thing. Shake Shack definitely did it! And plus when you are hungry at midnight, what can beat a great burger? Furthermore, if you are really hungry, you can have their famous milk shakes. I didn't try it because I was focusing on their burger and fries. My friend tried their milk shakes and they said it was wonderful too. Not only they have traditional burgers, they also have options for healthy eaters. In short, check it out! If you are hungry, I am sure you will be well served.",

We also ordered the black and white shake and for some reason, it came sort of watered down or melted.  It tasted good but the consistency was as if it was sitting out for a good half an hour or so.  Another person from our party had the peanut butter shake and his was fine so maybe we just had a crappy batch.  It was all good but would still prefer in n out.",

However, their shakes didn't taste overwhelmingly better than other custard shakes I've had. I still recommend people to try it and the food is good. It just didn't meet what I was expecting.

I was really excited to try this place with my friends because we were all really hungry waiting for the night. Simple menu with delicious choices, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I got the snackmeister burger for 6.69. Kind of pricey, but it's probably in the novelty. The burger itself was just average. The meat was a little dry and salty, but all the toppings made up for it. My friend got the hot dog and it just looked like a measly little meat stick. It was a bit cold too :( A bit overpriced for what you're getting, in my opinion. I did, however, love the cheese fries. Carbs galore, so who can say no to that? The dessert was also really good. I believe it was the jackpot concrete, but I'm pretty sure I'm wrong. It had custard, sprinkles, and cake bits. CAKE BITS. It was definitely enough to share between three girls, and I'm glad we got it. If you're looking for something quick and filling, this can probably satisfy the craving. I just don't see the hype if you take out the name though.",

Love the way they package their to go orders.   First bite says it all--Its texture is soft, right away after chewing I knew this burger was good quality beef, so very good. The bun is excellent. However, I couldn't taste the lettuce or tomato, and I couldn't tell if the burger had a sauce/spread. What I could taste was the overpowering salt. Was it the meat or cheese that caused the saltiness?   All in a all, a good quality burger-- loved the bun, soft warm texture, a bit pricey but I get it. Overall way better than Five Guys (yuck), but In & Out is still the winner. With the Habit a close second--IMO.   I will definitely try a Shack Burger again is Los Angeles--and give their fries & shake a taste too!  Now on to try Wahlburgers......",

    "text": "This is another go to spot for me for a late night snack depending on what my husband and I are feeling like eating. Also if my kids are with us this is probably a place we consider going to.   I like how they updated the outside next to Shake Shack. It does look a lot nicer by since its right by the stadium now. But during the day this place gets packed pretty quick. It makes it a bit difficult to find seats when you have a family. But in the later evenings it's not so bad so you aren't looking for an open table like everyone else. I actually prefer coming in the evening to avoid the hassle.  Service has always been ok. It's not bad but not superb either. I've been to the other shake shack off the strip where they were extremely nice to me and my kids so this location just has ok service.   The food is always good. It always tastes fresh. But there are times I feel like my burger comes out a bit sloppy. I think what my husband likes most is that instead of the advertisements of all their locations on their tv, they now play the games on tv so it makes it more entertaining for him. Overall it's ok. Not bad not great just ok.  Yelp 2017 Review Challenge 93/100",

    "text": "Let me start with the good, the ambiance is really cool, especially for a burger place. The shakes are really delicious and I would sell an organ for more of those cheesy bacon fries! The not so good is that I tried their flagship burger and I wasn't impressed. The place has a very contemporary feel and the service was very good, everyone was polite and worked to get our order to us quickly. Tip, if you mix the blood orange lemonade with a splash of sprite, it tastes just like a fruity spritzer. My husband and I split the fries and we were fighting over them, yes they are that good! We ordered the shroom stack which was a combination cheeseburger and mushroom burger that had a fried portobello with melted cheese in the middle, and we added bacon! Sounds amazing right, you can imagine our disappointment when we were completely underwhelmed by the flavor. I would definitely return again but only for my fries/drink fix. I'll stick to In&Out for a burger instead.",

We just wanted to try many places so we just shared a few items.  A hot dog, chicken sandwich, and a marshmallow shake.   The shake was awesome and the chicken sandwich was also good.  You would think it would be dry and chewy, but it was juicy.  The only thing that we could have skipped was the hot dog.  If you are with someone it is best to find a seat first, because it can get quite busy and crowded really quick.",

Shake Shack has been described to me as this glorious burger and fries joint that I need to try before I die, but honestly, the food was just ok.  Maybe after getting my buzz on, the food would be pretty acceptable. But it just tastes like a fast food burger and fries but at a higher price.  The fries were cold when they came out. Maybe if they were burning hot, it would have tasted better. The cheese is kind of cheap tasting.  I think I'm just comparing the food here to other places in Vegas. There are just much better places around here to get burgers and better places to get loaded fries.  If you need a recommendation, let me know (: I'm a local.   I did like the ambience here though.",

    "text": "Shake Shack was high on our list of places to go in Vegas. We were 20 minutes ahead of the 11 AM opening, no one around, so we wandered around the park in front of the arena, and came back 5 minutes before they opened to find a long line! The wait wasn't too bad, as ordering at the counter was pretty efficient. It took some time to get our food as they were just starting for the day. Navigating the crowd to pick up our food and bring it to the table took some patience. As we were finishing our meal people were hovering near by waiting for our table. So the crowds are kind of annoying.  We both got double cheeseburgers and shared an order of chili cheese fries and an order of plain fries. The burgers were extremely good. The beef patty is full of flavor and has that hand-ground texture that marks an excellent burger. The bun and toppings were all very nice. The plain crinkle-cut fries were nothing special. Similar to Del Taco but we like the flavor of Del Taco's fries better. The chili and cheese brought the fries to another level, very good chili, but there was not enough of it. Despite the crowd, a server came by and asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. \"More chili?\" said David, joking. But sure enough she returned a minute later with a small serving of chili. With that addition, the fries were excellent. Top marks for attentive service.  Is it the best burger? Well it's right up there. We placed it above Smashburger and Habit Burger, which we both like, in the company of such burger luminaries as Umami Burger and In N Out. You will have to make your own ranking. We would go back there again, but given the crowds I might be just as happy going to one of our other top spots.",

The have a non-alcoholic drink called 50/50, half lemonade and half tea that I like too. The line is always out the door but service is pretty fast from what I remember. There's a good amount of seating but it does get super packed. I alllllllways get the mushroom burger which just oozes with cheese. I really should get a normal burger but every time I come I just remember how much I love that mushroom burger that I end up ordering it again! The fries are crinkle cut so they still have a softness to them and they're not too salty. Definitely one of my go-to places when I'm in Vegas!",

My fries were fresh with the right amount of crunch to softness. I think the shake was the best part of my meal. It was really good without being overwhelmingly sweet.

I signed up for the email club before we visited Las Vegas and they sent me a welcome email and enclosed in the email was a 20% off my first app order promo code. I placed the order through the app, which is very easy to do and arrived at the time designated in the text message I received. When I stepped up to the pickup counter, the employee abruptly asked me what I needed and I explained to her that I was picking up a mobile order and proceeded to show her the order confirmation on my app, as it instructed me to do once arrived. She said, \"I need a name!\" , so I have her my name. Seems like communication is off regarding pickup instructions. My food still wasn't ready even though I got the text that it was. After about three additional minutes of wait time, I was handed my bag of food. Once assembled, I couldn't wait to try it. My burger and fries tasted fresh and were flavorful. My travel partner's chicken bites were not hot,  but she insisted that they tasted fresh and flavorful. I will definitely not hesitate to eat at a Shake Shack in the future.",

The comparisons to In N Out are the most confusing to me. In N Out burgers are much bigger and the meat is flavorful.

    "text": "Finally, I've had the chance to try out New York's pride and joy burger joint. And how fitting of it to be located outside of NYNY on the Strip. It's hard to miss, all green and lit up. For such a popular 'Hot & New' place, it was surprisingly uncrowded and line-less at the register. Ah, the benefits of visiting Vegas when it's not peak season...  We ordered the ShackBurger, SmokeShack, fries, and milkshakes, which all was about 10 minute wait on the buzzers. My burger, the SmokeShack, was okay. I do love bacon on my burgers and theirs was good, but I felt that the peppers were overpowering and took away from the patty juice. Sidenote: is it me or does the water in Vegas have a funny aftertaste? Luckily we got milkshakes, which were okay--the chocolate was much better than their Smores custard of the week)--but cost just as much as the burgers. They did serve out crispy, good crinkle cut fries (which usually aren't my preferred style).   Shake Shack Las Vegas wouldn't be my first choice to dine at on the Strip, but it was a decent visit when trying out the brand. I'm not quite on board with the price to quality ratio, though, so 3.5 stars for me.  Disclaimer: My guest from the UK convinced me to bump up my 3.5 to a 4, mostly because this was \"the best fast food burger I've ever had\" and we ended up going again the next day. I tried the ShackMeister Burger that time, which was much better. The crispy shallots were a nice compliment to a more balanced flavor on the burger. Though spacious, there was a weird indoor smell, so we moved out onto the patio to sit both times.",

This was my second Shake Shack experience and it was as good as the first. I ordered their Bacon, White Cheddar Burger with all the fixings except for onions and I savored every morsel, in like 2 minutes, lol. It was so good and gone from my fingers too fast. I also had a side of fries. Crinkled cut these fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and worth the diet I broke to eat here. My husband ordered the Double Down Fries which feature melted cheddar cheese, bacon and chopped red peppers and they were just alright, nothing to brag about and something I don't think he'll order again.   For dessert I had their Blueberry Lemon Custard, their seasonal flavor of the day and it was wonderful. The flavor combination was perfectly balanced so that you could actually taste both the blueberry and lemon flavor. I'm looking forward to the day Shake Shack opens up in the Bay Area but until then, Vegas it is.",

Okay, I can walk that. 0.5 miles is no problem.  wrong.  with the crowd traffic and the humidity + heat AND no water to hydrate us along the way, yeah you can say we almost didn't make it. That would've been a story to tell.   Shake shack is located right on the strip. No need to enter NYNY and search for it inside. The line was relatively short on a Saturday night around 10-11PM. I wanted to see the difference between shake shack burgers and in-n-out burgers. So far, in my opinion, in-n-out still has the best taste in burgers. BUT the fries at shake shack were far superior. Crunchy and didn't get that weird soggy texture like in-n-out fries. The SHAKES WERE SOOOO GOOD. Got the Chocolate cookies and cream. Def. a fan of their fries and shakes now. Lemonade was aight, it wasn't as sour as I wanted it to be but it was still great. Overall, great first time experience.",

    "text": "OMG I love Shake Shack! I had never been to one before (west coast girl here) so I was super excited to see one in Las Vegas and MADE SURE to try it on my first day there.  I came in a little after Noon on a Friday and was glad to see that there was no line, but all the tables inside and outside were packed! Luckily I was there by myself so I was able to find a rouge chair and table to sit at and eat. They have a lot of seats and tables, but it's just that busy! When I left at almost 1:00pm it was even worse, so make sure to come early! They open at 11:00.  I ordered their Vegetarian Shroom Burger and a Peanut Butter Shake. They both came out quickly and the Shroom Burger was DELICIOUS! It's a fried mushroom cap stuffed with cheese. Nom nom nom! I actually don't really like mushrooms very much but I loved this one. Definitely a must try! The Peanut Butter Shake was yummy as well, and I loved that it was made with custard. I've missed frozen custard ever since I moved out of Colorado and was stoked to finally get to have some again.  I liked Shake Shack so much on my first visit, that I dragged my Husband back a few days later. He had the Chicago Dog which he thought was good (but messy to eat) and we split their Cheese Fries which were sooooo GOOD! Would definitely get them again. I got the Shroom Burger again (yum) and a Peanut Butter Malt this time, but it tasted exactly like their regular shake so don't spend the extra $$.  I can't wait to come back!",

I thought in n out was going to win easily. The burger was pretty good. I'd say it's at the same level of in n out, but the fries. The fries of in n out are far more superior than shake shacks. Shake shacks fries were doughy in the middle. You get that potatoey feeling and suddenly made the meal a lot heavier. In n out fries are always seasoned and cooked to perfection. Now it's time for you all to make your own decisions on who takes the crown for the best fast food burger joint.",

Well maybe for the cheese fries ( I want more of those damn fries) and maybe the Shake Stack ( I didn't get the chance to try this burger).   I tried the Smoke Stack which is a cheeseburger topped with all natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and shack sauce, and it was good, but not memorable compared to In and Out's burgers. The burger was even smaller than In and Out's burgers and the price was about three times more than what you would pay at In and Out. My friends warned me that the burgers were not that impressive at Shake Shack and they were right. However, their cheese fries was a winner. I loved the combination of the warm nacho cheese on their crinkle fries.  I also tried their strawberry shake, which is quite delicious, but I did not care for the price. To me, the burgers and shakes at Shake Shack is just too overpriced and I would stick to In and Out any day.   Also, lines are long!!! Thank god, my amazing friends were willing to grab Shake Shack while my lazy butt was in the hotel watching Rush Hour. Be prepared to wait in line and don't go while hungry.",

Overall, I've heard so much comparison between shake shack and in-n-out but I don't think they are comparable in that in-n-out is more fasfood-ish than shake shack and therefore, you're paying a lot less. In terms of comparison of deliciousness between the burger and fries between both, I can't decide! I probably have to try shake shack again.",

When I discovered there was one in Las Vegas and we were going to be there en route of a trip, I made a special point of stopping in.  Burger was perfect in size and juicy; bun a soft, yeast bread pillow to soak up the patty grease; toppings fresh, crisp, and plenty how I like it.  Fries had a good crunch for crinkle fries (I'm more familiar with the softer version and don't care for it) and topped with the cheese sauce made it even better.  Concrete didn't live up to expectations though. I ordered a small create your own to share considering everything else we ordered. The menu concretes had too many mix-ins for my taste so I went simple vanilla frozen custard with chocolate truffle cookie dough. The latter was very rich, too rich for me.  A table is quite hard to come by during lunch. A number of us were kind of hovering, surveying the tables, and anxiously waiting for people to leave so we could swoop in. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  Hope they bring Shake Shack to the Bay Area soon!",

I get dinner here on my first night and it wasn't packed which was good so I got to place my order quick. I do like how this place has lots of options to choose from compared to In-N-Out but that's all the credit they get. Quantity does not equal quality.  After going through their menu I decide to try their Smoke Shack burger since it \"supposedly\" comes with bacon. I did not get any bacon in my burger so either I got scammed or it's a separate charge. Whatever. I also wanted to get their loaded fries with cheese and bacon but 9 bucks for it? Screw that. I went with the cheese fries for $4 instead and a water bottle for $2.40 which my total came out to $14.31  I didn't have to wait too long for my food so that was a plus. However the burger wasn't mind blowing good like everyone is raving about. I was quite disappointed in the size of the burger for the amount I paid for which was nearly $7. The cheese fries were alright. I wanted to try their shakes but since I was paying a buttload for this place I opted not to.  Workers here were nice but overall my meal experience here was less than to be desired. I'm glad I got to try this place finally and I can say there is no need for me to go try the one in West Hollywood.",

I've had a hamburger and a chicken sandwich at this location and I actually loved both. Not to mention they have crinkle cut fries and I am a sucker for them. The shakes, ice cream, and cement are also delicious.

Right on the strip, you get to people watch as you sit and munch on a hot, juicy, burger wrapped in paper with two patties, two cheese, sliced tomato, leaf lettuce, sliced onion and a great sauce - this is one fantastic burger.   Shake Shack - one of my new favorites.",

Ordered two burgers and chili cheese fries.  The burgers were fantastic.  They sort of reminded me of 5 guys burgers, but better.  I could have done without the chili cheese fries, the cheese was kinda gross to me (but I also wasn't feeling so great with the heat).  The restaurant itself isn't as small as it appears and you can generally find seating.  If it wasn't 118 degrees out, I could have sat outside as there is plenty of places.  Overall I would return to shake shack again.",

    "text": "I had been waiting to try this place for a long time. Maybe the hype and excitement was too built up for me, but I actually wasn't at all wowed by my experience here at Shake Shack. It was not terrible however it certainly had hits and misses. Shake Shack is attached to New York New York Hotel and Casino, but you have to park at NY NY and walk through the casino out to the sidewalk on LV Blvd to enter Shake Shack. Walking inside I saw lots of heads and was actually glad we were getting our order to-go because seating inside was limited. I was surprised with the amount of customers eating inside that the line wasn't longer, but there was only one customer ahead of us. After placing our order we were told to stand off to the side near the pick-up area where it took a reasonable amount of time to receive our food and the employees who helped us were nice and helpful.  Chick'n Shack ($6.29) - Crispy chicken with lettuce, pickles and buttermilk herb mayo on a potato bun. The chicken was tasty and I really liked it, but the shredded lettuce was hot, wilted, didn't taste fresh and reminded me of what they put on the McChicken at McD's. I'd personally prefer a nice crisp piece of lettuce instead. I recently tried Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken in Downtown Summerlin and they also use shredded lettuce however it had a crisp and fresh taste to it unlike my experience here at SS. The buttermilk herb mayo could have been spread a bit heavier because I couldn't taste it at all and I love mayo on my chicken sandwiches. This sandwich was lacking in the tomato and bacon department and could even have benefited from a slice of cheese, all things I know now to add customized next time if I decide to give them another try. They have a Downtown Summerlin (happens to be right across from BRFC) location which I pass by regularly, so I'd more than likely try that one if I do and the chicken sandwich I'll have tweaked to my liking and I'll pay for the extra add-ons to make it that way. Extra bacon is currently $1.55 which isn't bad considering I don't buy drinks here and just food only. It can add up when buying the full meals, but we usually have our own fountain drinks that we stop at a corner store and get.   Cheese Fries ($3.99) - The cheese sauce was so thin and hardly had flavor. The fries themselves were just average tasting. I personally wouldn't bother with the fries again.  Hubby liked his Double Shack Burger, but felt it wasn't anything special for $8.09 and there wasn't enough bun for the amount of burger. I thought it looked wrapped in lettuce rather than bun at first glance. Hubby most likely will not return at his request, but I'll possibly give the chicken sandwich a try in the future.",

    "text": "As a individual trying to be a health freak, when i see no antibiotics, natural ingredients etc, it catches my attention and to try this place. Glad i did. The burgers are delicious!   I got the 'shroom burger (vegetarian), which is a portobello mushroom with muenster cheese, lightly battered and fried. Surprisingly it wasn't too greasy or filling. It was perfect with their signature sauce.  Hubby got the double cheeseburger which to me the meat taste like in n out but with a different kick and flavor in their signature sauce. I think they mixed a bit of horseradish and vinegar in it for that kick which was delicious! Compared to In n out though, they give you more meat which is thicker but then again its much costly.   Hubby prefers In n out while its hard to compare in my opinion as they both have their own flavors. Both are great!  I also got the cheese fries which they use the nacho cheese sauce which I love. Well im the worse person to ask in regards to the cheese because I just love cheese in general. No one calls me the dairy queen for nothing, you know. So if you don't like nacho cheese, get it plain.  Tried the shake as that's what everyone pretty much come here for but i have to say i wasn't a fan of it. Very filling and too sweet for my pallet. Level of sweetness is a bit sweeter than a coca cola on comparison and density is literally like a semi melted ice cream. Very thick/creamy. So if you like your shake very sweet and dense, you will like it. We got the black & white and the vanilla. Their most popular is black&white and PB.  Overall, great place, not too greasy for a burger joint. A bit too costly though for amount you get. So have to (minus 1-star).",

A dining table is blocking the restroom entrance, it's very hard for person with wheelchair or strollers get into the restroom.  I visited earlier today with my son in his stroller, I had to move the chair blocking the restroom entrance and one of their employees were just standing there (about a feet from me) and watching me moving their chair :)   The changing station in the restroom was kinda dirty. 2 used plastic cups were placing right there, and I notice the employee had just \"cleaned\" the restroom and filled up the paper towels like a minute ago.

The Las Vegas location is quite busy, but the long line goes by quickly. Wait time for food was about 15 minutes.   I got the 'Shroom Burger - a hot crispy mushroom filled with gooey cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sauce all nestled in two delicious buns. Ughh I'm drooling as I write about this. I also got a strawberry shake which was good but nothing too special. They have a special for the shakes which periodically changes, so check out what the special is on the menu wall if you wanna try something different! They also have a few beers on tap which is nice.   I'm surprised I liked this place so much since I'm not usually a big fan of burgers. But I gotta say this one definitely makes me want to come back for more!",

    "text": "My east coast burger-lovin' friends always rave about this place -- I've been privy to plenty of aerial instagram pics of crinkly fries pornographically smothered in cheese alongside half-exposed burgers in all their glory.  So naturally, when Vegas was bestowed with a Shake Shack on the strip, I was curious to see just what the hype was about.  First impression: there's a giant menu to greet you when you walk in. As a first-timer, this is useful. The interior has that modern wood/sleek metal combination look. The layout was bigger than I what I was expecting. When we went, late-night on a Thursday, there was plenty of seating available.   I opted for the standard: the single Shackburger with some crinkly fries. It was good. It reminded me a lot of In-N-Out, but at double the price. I guess this is where you'd go if you feelin' fancy. The crinkly fries were plumper and better than say, Raising Cane's. So I'll give them that.  Maybe I'll come back to try their shakes next time (since it IS called the SHAKE shack), maybe another burger or a chance on the hot dog, but for now, it wasn't really anything special for me...at least I can upload my very own aerial food picture now, though.",

It is also very spacious unlike the locations I have been to in New York.  My order came out fast and hot when I was there.      Everything about the burger is good.  The meat is cooked well and has great flavor.  The toppings are fresh and the cheese is melty.  The potato bun is soft and fluffy.  I love it all.  There is nothing too special about the fries but they are good and come out hot.  The shakes are to die for too.  I love the black and white shake which is a combination between vanilla and chocolate.  I also highly recommend the peanut butter chocolate shake as well - great peanut butter flavor.  I tried a custard concrete at this location which was super awesome too.  It was very rich and sweet though.  I couldn't finish a whole one by myself.  I definitely think this place is worth a try when you are craving a burger on the strip.",

I love the quality of meat. I could definitely taste how fresh it was! Mine were cooked perfectly each time. The sauce and everything else that went with it were great as well. The bread was soft and reminded me of a Hawaiian Kings bun but not as sweet. The fries the first time I got them were REALLY salty. Not sure if it was the batch I got but the second time around, I asked for no salt and they were perfect! The quality of their fries were up to par on my fry game. I also tried their \"concrete\" which is their famous custard blended with a topping. I got the chocolate with cookie dough topping. It was very sweet (even for me) but hit the spot in the heat. I pretty much drank it as I took my order to go, haha. Still yummy and I would definitely try another on my next visit. They have flavors of the week so that's always a nice twist on things. My only thing about this place is that it is pricey (at least compared to in-n-out and other fast food joints) but you do pay for quality, the service is a hit or miss, and it gets super busy as the hype is real. A good spot to try if you're on the south side of the strip in NY NY!",

    "text": "So I'm from California and I'm not a fan of In-n-Out! I know that seems to be a bit weird but honestly I've had better burgers and the ones at the Shake Shack are better! There just seems to be a difference in quality that stands out at the Shake Shack.   So I stuffed my face twice while I was on my trip. They open at 11 am and by 11:09 they were already starting to get busy so I would get there early. We passed by in the late afternoon and the line was WAY out the door. They have an outside line or \"C\" line for drinks and frozen custard only which is helpful when you want something quick.   I had the SmokeShack which had bacon, chopped cherry peppers and ShackSauce. The cherry peppers weren't too spicy but it gave the burger some good flavor. The bacon was nice and they weren't cheap with it either.   My second visit I had the 'Shack Stack which has a burger patty and the fried Portobello mushroom on it. The Portobello mushroom is fried and has cheese in the middle of it. It is kinda messy to bite into since the cheese just explodes out of it. While it did add some flavor, I didn't think the breading on the mushroom was all that great. It didn't have enough flavor to it. The meat on the burger though was very good and I enjoyed that.   I had the cheese fries the first time and the second time I added fried shallots to my cheese fries for a $1.00 more. Adding the shallots was worth the extra buck since it added some salty crunch to the cheese fries.   I had the shake of the week which was a peanut butter banana and it was good but the flavor seemed to get lost. It didn't matter though because I was still eating frozen custard and that makes it the best. I also had a black & white shake which is really just vanilla and chocolate blended together and that was super creamy and yummy. I also had an 'All shook up' concrete and that had way too much going on.  The concrete had vanilla custard, Gimme Some Sugar banana peanut butter cheesecake, and chocolate toffee. I didn't really taste the banana peanut butter in the cheesecake and the chocolate toffee got hard to eat as it was getting colder in the custard.   I loved going here and glad that I don't have to go to New York to try them now. I'll keep coming back because it was good and for what I got it wasn't too bad of a price.",

    "text": "So glad this opened up in Vegas! I have heard so many great things about this place, as I am sure you have too! Walking up to the building you just know things are going to be good! The place is very well lit and super cute and trendy inside. My favorite thing is the tv wall that showcases a bunch of images and videos from the NY location. It almost seems like you're in NY!   And now to the food! I love that they have seasonal desserts, great knowing the dessert menu isn't set and gives you a reason to want to come back. Of course that is asides from coming back for their awesome burgers and hotdogs! The burger is as good as people claim is! What really sold it for me though was there cheesy crinkle cut fries! So simple, yet so delish! My only disappointment was how small their burgers were. I def. could have eaten two in one sitting.  Overall, this place is def. worth the hype!  Now go out and try it for yourself!",

I liked the burger,it was cooked perfectly and I like the fact that they obviously use beef with some fat in it which keeps it juicy! The crinkle cut fries are great! I got mine with melted cheese but recommend skipping the cheese,better without it! I also didn't like the \"Shack Sauce\" had a weird taste I couldn't figure out. I'd come here again but would skip the sauce and get plain fries! Shakes were great! For those who want a comparison to In N Out, I'm from California and can say the Burgers are about equal with In N Out much cheaper but Shake Shack fries are MUCH BETTER than In N Out !!!",

Granted it only took 5-10 to get our food afterwards, it stands that the wait must be caused by the cashiers I guess(?) anyways, that knocked down my review a star.  The milkshakes were average in my opinion. Less than a block away, Blvd Creamery at Monte Carlo has better milkshakes if that's really what you're craving.  The burgers. I had their bacon cheeseburger. It was average in my opinion. My brother on the other hand had the burger that's a cheeseburger topped with their muenster-filled portobello, and I must say, that was delicious.  The fries were ok. From other reviews, you'd think they've never had crinkle cut fries before. Or that they've never had cheese on fries.  Overall, it was an ok place to try, but I don't see myself ever coming back here to eat.",

The was a bit of a lineup, but it moved quite quickly. After ordering, we're given a buzzer which was cool. A little more organized than calling out numbers. The location was kept very clean and modern inside. It wasn't too hard to find seats, as there is a lot of turn over here and guests are considerate to leave once done their meal.  We wanted to try the original, so we ordered the double, draft root beer and a strawberry shake. All GREAT! The burger was just so melt in your mouth delicious. It was a tad salty, but that didn't stop me from devouring this beast.  The shake was sooo friggen good. I would go back just for a shake, but it would be hard to resist a burger. The root beer was only alright, I'm not sure I would order it again.  Overall, I was amazed. Burgers are one of my favourite foods, I'm not easily amazed by a burger, but when I am, it's so eye opening.   This is a definite must when going to Vegas (or NY)",

It has that creamy cookies n cream texture but goes down smoothly with the fries and burger. shack burger, cheese fries and milkshake came out to be around $15.

The burgers are simple yet delicious. The fries aren't my favorite, but they're still good. We also tried their cold brew, peach lemonade, and creamsicle float. The peach lemonade was really good, although it was a bit too sweet. And the creamsicle was delicious (it's basically vanilla ice cream with orange soda; sounds weird but it was good!).",

So of course we had to be one of the first people to christen it. We showed up 1.5 hours before the official grand opening and were literally first in line haha. Instead of having us stand to the side in the cold, one of the staffers actually came out to greet us and then offered us some seating on the patio under the heaters. Great service even before the doors opened!   As for the food, my go-to is the Shack Stack with red peppers - a cheeseburger topped with a deep fried cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom. Heaven on a bun! I also breathed a sigh of relief when I heard that the crinkle cut fries are here to stay instead of the natural cut fries.

The \"sauce\" they have on the burger was a horrible orange looking color and it tasted like it was spoiled. (The same taste you get in the back of your throat when you have a cold).

    "text": "this is probably the only burger joint you will go to without feeling guilty  or greasy after you're done.  a little pricey  but worth the quality of meat. shakes are perfect not too thin and not to thick and bursting with flavor!   yeah its crowded and the lines are long but eh. it's the strip .. for locals it may not be enough to walk  on the wild side and trek the ever annoying strip and crowds of people. but if you have to go there anyways might and well  stop by for a bite.   everything is A la carte with strip prices so about $11-15 a meal  I took my kids and it wasn't too bad. it is loud so good for the family ... (not a date night place )   lines breeze by there's lots of cashiers. food is about 20 minute depending on the craziness.   the smoke shack double is the way to go (bacon...duh) cheese fries yum but plain is also good.   we've been here handful of times so we don't mind coming on a Sunday or weekday when it's not so crazy  things only reason the lack of a star is my roadhouse burger had carmelized onions that were way to gooey totally smushed my burger. shoulda stayed with my original smoke shack .",

    "text": "BELIEVE THE HYPE! Man I'm new to Vegas but I just might stay now. They got three of the most popular burger chains all within one mile of each other. In n Out, White Castle, and the incredible SHAKE SHACK. I didn't really expect too much besides a good burger. I've heard the comparisons to In n Out but I knew better than to compare and to take it as its own beast. Now I'm from LA, so In n Out is my thing but DAAAMMNNNNN. Not gonna lie we were blown away.  Ok first, we were trying to not be fat, so we decided to share. We fixed that later. We started with a smokeshack double, cheese fries, a coke, and a vanilla shake (Our idea of not being fat).  So first and foremost; the cheese fries are off the hook! I know it's just cheese and fries but they were bomb. My 5' girlfriend demanded her own cheese fries next time.  The vanilla shake was really good, and the fact that they only use sugar and milk products without any corn syrup makes it that much better.  Now the smokeshack double was good, however it came with peppers and that really affects the taste of the burger. So while it was good, I felt I didn't get a fair chance to really experience the flavor of their burger. So after we finished what we already ordered we did the fat thing and went back to get a shack burger with lettuce and tomato. And man, that's where it's at. They have different variations but I believe the original is the best. I'm coming back tomorrow. No lie. If they weren't already about to close when we left I would've gone back again tonight! Super bomb. And I didn't even know until we left but my girlfriend informed me that they only use grass fed certified Angus for their patties. That's just a bonus for me because I'll be back regardless. Good job east coast. Good job. Oh and the service was impeccable. But it wasn't busy when we went so I'm not sure how they handle the rush.",

Yeah the burgers are a little small but the quality of meat is much better than in n out. The only thing I wish that they offered is onions. Not even an option. I love raw onions on my burger. Their fries were good too. We got the loaded one with cheese, bacon & cherry peppers. The vegetarian burger was so good. Would eat here again",

It was just all printed out on a giant wall while you waited in line. I had ordered their original burger and fries then the frozen custard with waffle pieces was to die for. The meal was so good after it arrives in a quick manner which was nice to not have to wait long. The burger was very soft and had very good flavor. You can really taste the difference from a regular fast food joint. This is definitely a place to visit again!",

This LV location created some buzz as well, so we paid a visit. Myself and 3 companions went in April 2015 for supper.  I ordered the Smoke Shack single, crinkle cut fries and root beer. The fries were literally no different than the ones you were served in grade school or Ore Ida...the burger was dressed with lettuce, tomato and onion which were fresh enough, then some ham and bacon. ..really didn't detect those much, and the burger was pretty bland as well. The bun was basic. The only redeeming feature was the sauce which had a little tang to it. Quite honestly Culver's or Fat burger deliver better burgers...cheaper. The design of the restaurant was trendy and we were able to sit outside which I liked. Service was very cheery and pleasant which I appreceiated. By LV standards this is an affordable place to eat...but I still can't help but to feel that $17 is too much for a boring burger meal. Sorry.",

Both of our burgers were cooked perfectly... juicy! The buns are amazing. I'm not sure what buns they use, but woah. Weird, I know... but we both noticed that while eating.   So to avoid sounding anymore like Sir Mix A Lot... on to the shake! I got a vanilla shake... I honestly thought it'd be a little bigger, in size. But the shake quality and taste was a solid 8 out of 10.   Shake Shack serves up some crispy crinkle french fries...which we also enjoyed. This serving size is another that I thought would be a little bigger. For the strip, the pricing was less than we though it'd  be. Two burgers, one order of fries and a vanilla shake came up to $21 and some change, not cheap but not horrible either.   I love the decor! This location is clean and spacious... lots of tvs (mostly showing sports the night that we dined in). They also have a quick window (outside) for drink orders...and outdoor seating. It's best that you pay attention to the menu and know what you want to order while in line so that when you get to the window, you don't waste time. have never been to the Shake Shacks on the east coast, but this one is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!",

I got the shack stack which includes a fried portobello mushroom (that seemed to also be infused with cheese) and it was DELICIOUS.... Their hamburger buns are unique. They're really moist and fresh. The meat patties are bigger than In-n-out's. I will say the burgers are really small for the price. This place is PRICEY for what you get.  The shack stack was $9 something and it's about the size of an in-n-out burger.   The concretes are good but aren't really that crazy or special like they're hyped up to be IMO. I got the chocolate with Belgian waffle bits. It was crazy rich and sweet. And dense. And melted fast.   The cheese fries are soo good... I don't normally like crinkle cut but I liked these--probably because they were smothered in cheese.  Overall, I'd say: Really good but too expensive  Burgers are much oilier than in-n-outs  Service was good. Place was clean and lively   We got 2 shack stacks, 2 cheese fries, 1 chocolate shake and 1 chocolate concrete with Belgian waffle bits and it was $40.",

Holy crap to the chocolate shake. It taste. Like they grinded up real Hershey's bars into a shake form. It tasted like a real quality shake instead of the powder crap so many other places have.  Getting a main thing each, and then the fries and shake to split, left us both feeling perfectly satisfied, full, but not over the top.  I wish this place was in San Jose.",

My dad is a huge fan of their fries and loved their shack burger (as do my sister and I). He liked them because they were crispy and thick. We went at about 4-5pm and they had run out of their mango lemonade. The regular lemonade was refreshing. Like I said, this is rare that we all like a burger place. Shake shack, you are amazing!",

I ordered the shackstack, which is a regular cheeseburger with a fried cheese stuffed portabello mushroom acting as a second patty. The burden way delicious and juicy. I absolutely love how buttery the bun is and how well it compliments the flavors of the meat and portabello mushroom.

I went here for lunch one day with my coworkers when we needed to get out of the office, and you have no idea how happy I was. The energy in there is very positive and you leave completely satisfied!   Food - Absolutely fantastic! I had the specialty burger which had bacon and grilled onions. The meat was so tender, and it made my mouth water just looking at it. I am huge sucker for cheesy fries, so you can guess how excited I was to order those. I would have liked the fries to be a little crispier, but I will definitely ask if they can do that next time. The shake was so thick and creamy. I had the black and white (chocolate and vanilla swirl).  Would definitely come back!",

For paying $20 at In n Out for a good family meal, I'll pay $45 here. Shake Shack's shakes are phenomenal. Probably one of the best I've ever had. This place has a great atmosphere with TV's and the enormous amount of young people. However, this place does get very crowded around the 3 main feeding times. I would not wait in a  20 minute line for this food.",

I ordered the Smoke Shack with cheddar bacon fries and a drink.  The burger was pretty bland and did not have a lot of taste.  The only saving grace for this burger was the bacon.  The fries looked like they were previously frozen but had a nice crisp to it.  The fries had cheddar cheese with bacon sprinkled on it but tasted pretty rich and heavy.  Because of that, I didn't finished it.  The drink I had is standard for Coke, but I had to go to the counter to get my complimentary refill because the soft drink dispenser is not in the dining room.  Verdict on taste of food, specifically the burger, I would rate the food as average.  In N Out wins hands down on burger comparison based on taste.",

Typical fast food place, long line that moves quickly, ample seating. It's not as cheap (and probably why most people compare it to in-n-out) but the taste is definitely there. Check it out when you're on the strip, it's the only one on the west coast for now anyway.",

First off, don't compare it to In n Out.  They are both great in their own right.  I would compare Shake Shack to Super Duper Burger in San Francisco.  The patty was very good. Seared nice and juicy.  The highlight was the bun.  I believe it is a potato bun.  It is awesome  and just a moist bun, nothing I had before.  The burger is pretty small and I was thinking I should have gotten the double patty but I think I had my fill of calories.  That is why it reminds me of Super Duper Burgers.  The cheese fries were great.  As good as Nathan's cheese fries.  The custard was great.  Almost as good as Luv-it Custard.  The odd thing is that sodas are single serving and not the soda fountain.    All in all, I thought it was a great burger joint, and I wish they'd open on in San Diego as we really don't have many good burger places except for In n Out and Islands",

We waited around until 11 and cruised over.  Now, I remembered a friend of mine saying she went to the one in NYC and wasn't actually paying attention when she ordered so she got the mushroom burger and it was an actual portabella and not a burger with mushrooms and Swiss, so in looking over the menu I had to laugh.  I got the ShackMeister dog and my husband got the Shack-ago dog.  We split a small order of fries and I got a peanut butter shake.  I was on vacation, what can I say?  Sat down in a terribly uncomfortable booth.  It was wooden and my belt kept getting caught on the back of the booth so I was getting irked.  Food didn't take too long and we dug in - hot dogs were decent.  Mine had 2 kinds of cheese and some crispy french fried shallots.  I liked it and it hit the spot, but I wouldn't get it again.  Fries were good as well.  I love crinkle cuts, so that helped.  I'm not a burger eater, so may not be the place for me.  What I would get again is one of those shakes - whoa!  I'm not a huge ice cream fan, but this sucker was great!  Smooth and delicious with not an overpowering peanut butter taste.  I got a small, but I should have gotten something bigger since my husband kept saying, \"can I have some more?\"  So, next trip to Vegas, I get a really big shake to take while bumming around town...even though it will not last very long!",

The girl touched them with both her back and front of her hand as if she need to double confirm their coldness factory!  The cheesy fries taste like they have heated up canned cheese atop of them.  Basically Del-taco fries here.  We also had a custard and a concrete which were also just ok especially for the calories listed.  I was hoping the taste would match the calories but it didn't :-(.

Just under $10 bucks for a single burger and fries in this case was not worth it. Great location, busy place and I'm sure it will do great but i think I would rather catch a cab to im and out rather than eat here.",

The Burgers are about the best I have had better then 5 guys or In and Out. The Shakes are a yes also they change up the special flavors each week so I caught two of them Caramelized Peach which was good but not my flavor and Blueberry lemon curd which was off the chart good. I like that their sizes of both food and shakes are not huge you don't feel like you ate a Football after you leave there. I also tried one of their hot dogs and that was a hit also their take of a Chicago Dog.  I was bummed I did not get to try the Concretes which are like a Mcflurry but with crazy unique ingredients like peanut butter banana cheesecake. Next Time I will try them.   If your in Vegas its a Must try.",

The French fries were ok, Kroger brand frozen fries are just as good my kids got the shakes and they were happy with them, I think or maybe they were just SO parched because we were in Vegas on the hottest day!

I had a single Shackburger and a peanut butter milkshake. Granted the burger had decent flavor, and I probably should have gone with a double to get a little more meat because it was small, for $5.19. The milkshake was $5.25, and if you have read my previous reviews regarding milkshakes, you can't serve an expensive milkshake and only provide 12 oz of creamy goodness. It might have been 16 oz but if sure felt like 12. So that didn't work for me either.   Place was pretty busy for a Tuesday at noon, with a lot of tourists. The wait for the burger was only 5 minutes, which is better than In and Out. They give you a pager so you can wander around looking for a table. Fortunately one opened up just as I got my burger.  I'll come back, try the double burger, maybe add some bacon. I'll stick to ice tea for a beverage. Now I have to go give my friend some crap about his burger list!",

I had never been to a Shake Shack before so it took me a little bit to decide but I finally went with the Shack burger with fries and a coke. It was about $12 for everything which isn't too bad but as a native Californian, I'm used to paying $6 for this same kind of meal at In N Out. I got a little pager and found a table and I'd say within 5 minutes my food was ready. It was a really great burger, fries were good and it was plenty of food. If I can't get In N Out (being in Nashville now), I'd gladly pay for Shake Shack to get my burger fix if it's around since it'd technically be cheaper than the boutique eateries where 1 burger is $15 alone. I'd eat here again for sure.",

The fact that we dont even have shake shack in the bay makes it really hard to compare a burger that cost 3x more money.   I was in Vegas EDC weekend and decided to check out. The first thing that caught my eye was the prices. It is a lot more expensive for fast casual dining. at $10 per burger alone its pretty steep. I got the mushroom burger. The burger was a little bit bigger than In n out. Inside the mushroom was stuff cheese which i didn't know. It was awesome. I wish more places would cook the bun from the inside so its nice and crunchy and will hold its composure more.   There are a lot of better tasting burgers than In N out, but it still can't beat its value. SS was awesome but $16 meal is pretty steep. I will def make my way back her when i come back to vegas tho.",

I can say that SS has INO whooped. Their crinkle fries dominate INO's feeble potato slivers. But, their pricepoints are significantly different also. Basically triple. So to be fair to INO would I rate SS as thrice as good? Yes. So, I guess by my metric then they are equal.  The double Smokeshack I ate was flavorful. I could taste the seasoning on the meat & not just cheese like INO's. *Disclaimer-I order my burgers dry, no spread. Also, tried the Shack-cago dog. Pretty good.   Everyone was friendly except for the girl calling & handing out food. She had a sour look on her face especially for one as attractive looking as she was. The only negative. Perhaps she was having a bad day so I'll give her the BOTD.  Wish they had SS in OC. Closest location is Glendale or Hollywood. Boohoo.",

The short and dirty of this review is :Yes its super yummy, but NO, its not as good as in n out!!!!  Their burger is fresh and organic, no doubt. But its nothing any more special than in n out. The only thing I like better about Shake's burger is their bun. Its a potato bun and way moister than In n outs IMO!  Onto Fries. Fries are Better than in n out. They are crinkle kind and actually SALTED. I get their cheese sauce on them every time which is seriously magical. Its like queso- not a piece of sliced cheese melted on top.  Shakes are good- but not as amazing as a Neapolitan at In n out.  Also- its more expensive. $25 for 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries and 1 shake.  You get more bang for your buck at In n Out!  PS-they sell doggie biscuits which is A+++++ in my book.",

For the first time in my life I considered making an appointment with a psychiatrist. DurIng my downtime late at night I went through my friends list and pondered unfriending anyone that wrote positively about them.   I would describe the cheese fries this way: think of a bag of frozen fries at the grocery store, warm them up in the microwave a bit so they're soggy and not crispy, and throw on some melted cheese that they use on nachos at Little League and AYSO snack stands.  Ok, now that I got that off my chest, I think I can move on with my life.  Usually an opening with that much negatively would lead to a 1 or 2 star review, but to be fair I will rate Shake Shack as a whole:  +1 star for the spaciousness of their layout and overall presentation +1 for the outdoor seating facing The Strip  +1 for their custard window: I could see myself returning just for this +1 for their burgers: read everyone else's reviews  +1 for the variety of their hot dog options: hello chicken apple sausage +1 for the drinks: shakes and beer, and a beer float -3 stars for the cheese fries  After my meal, I returned to my hotel room and sat in the shower crying.",

We went during lunch time and even though they were busy, we are able to order pretty quickly and the food followed shortly after we are seated.   We decided to split a burger (mind you, we had never eaten here before) ordered fries and a chocolate malt. The burger is probably the perfect size for me, but for my hubs, it's a little too small. We ordered a shake shack burger - basically a cheeseburger. It was okay. Every bite I took, I couldn't help but just taste grease. I couldn't taste the special sauce either which was a big bummer.   But the fries were the best part about the $15 we spent there. The fries were pretty crispy, which is how I love my fries to be. I'm not a big fan of the crinkle fries, but I am if its from SS!   Overall it was an okay experience. I'm definitely open to trying something different the next time we come across SS.",

It was my first time here and I paid $15 for a burger, cheese fries and a milkshake. The burger honestly just tastes like something you can whip up at a picnic bbq. The cost of a burger here is almost an entire meal at In-N-Out. Nothing really impressive other than the decor and location. I thought it was really cute to put a Shake Shack in New York New York. Other than that, 3 stars goes to the cheese fries!",

Shakes made with custard not ice cream. I ordered the caramel- it was good not too sweet. My daughter had the shake of the week with raspberries and my son had the frozen custard of the week which was even better.  The peach lemonade my husband ordered was only mediocre. Outside has fans and misters above seating areas. As I am not a fan of shakes in general- it was not the greatest or the worst I've ever tried. Just wanted to see what all the hype was about.",

I enjoyed the expansive menu options but so far all the extra stuff beyond burgers and fries have been a let down.  In NYC I had an expensive premium coffee milkshake that was forgettable.  In Vegas I tried the Jackpot concrete that was basically Vanilla custard with some 3-4 stale tasting Belgian waffle chunks in it and sprinkles. As far as In n Out comparison goes, I'll give Shake Shack a slight edge on burgers and huge edge on fries.  But In n Out murders them on bang for buck.  If both In n Out and Shake Shack had equal prices and were available in my backyard, I'd probably visit them equally as often.",

I came at 1am and there weren't too many people in line, they close at 2am. Found out that one of the managers came from NY, awesome! The food was as great as I remember, and my BF commented that he liked it even better than the Shake Shack we had in NY. Service was on point, and we got our food pretty quickly. This place looks like a well oiled machine!  Must get the shack stack, the portabello burger on top of the cheeseburger is incredible, especially when you take that first bite and the muenster cheese ozzes out!

This location is located inside New York New York. I heard and read about the long lines here, but both times, I have been lucky and there was minimal lines. The employees here try very hard to move everyone along so the lines here move fairly quickly.   I have tried here the Shake burger (which is their normal hamburger with tomatoes, lettuce, onion, and cheese), fries (which are crinkle cut), cheese fries and vanilla shake. I have to give Shake Shack the edge (BARELY) on the burger and fries. The burger is delicious and tasty, with all the ingredients and meat tasting so fresh. The fries are crispy and oh so tasty. But, I am going to give it up to In N out for their animal fries (their version of cheese fries) and the shake. The cheese fries at Shake Shack tasted a little bland. It was pretty much the crinkle cut fries with cheese melted on it. Nothing special. The shake was also a bit of a let down. There was just nothing special about it. I had figured for the price I paid for it (which was a little more expensive than In N Out), it would be amazing.   So, bottom line, which do I like better??? I don't know!! I think both places are good, with certain items being better at each restaurant. I am sure I will change my mind each time on which is better.  For the time being, I am going to be happy knowing there are 2 fast food places that are so good and tasty.",

I wasn't a huge fan of the chocolate shake either - it was richer than I'd like. All of these things are personal tastes - the restaurant seemed clean. It was overpriced but on par for the vegas strip.",

    "text": "My first time trying the Shake Shack ever. The interior is nicely decorated, they need more seats inside though since it's always so hot in Vegas! As many fast food places are: you order, take a seat, and wait for your buzzer to go off to grab your food. Lines are quite long but go fairly fast and service is phenomenal.   Of course I had to try a SHAKE, hence the name! Our cashier said the 2 most popular shakes are the strawberry and coffee. The strawberry was so so, nothing amazingly special, I'll have to try the coffee next time. The strawberry shake tasted exactly like in n out burgers strawberry shake, but just more expensive. The cups seem small.  The BURGERS I tried were the Shackburger and the Smoke Shack Burger. I enjoyed the regular Shackburger more. The burger buns were made like pockets, I thought that was very creative and cool. The special shack sauce they used was tasty. And cheese was really good. The burger patty was a bit chewy. And the FRIES, the crinkled fries were my favorite part!!! We tried both the cheese fries and regular fries, both very crispy and again cheese was very delicious! Overall, I prefer in n outs burgers more, but fries more at the shake shack. As of now, the shakes are the same. And the selection is much larger than in n out, but it's also almost double the price! I don't know if they do free add ons to you burger like in n out does or not, will have to ask next time.",

I love the Shack Stack bc you can't say no to a fried cheese filled mushroom.  Or at least I can't.  This burger is so bomb.  Whenever I'm asked if I like In N Out or Shake Shack better, I'd have to go w/ Shake Shack (blasphemy, right).  I mean, if In N Out started making a burger with a fried cheese filled mushroom then maybe I'd like them better, but for now--it goes to Shake Shack.  One thing In N Out has on them is their fries. Not digging the fries. I usually get the cheese fries--bc, cheese--but don't like the texture of the fries and don't like how the cheese is that liquidy cheese. I prefer that square Kraft cheese, lol.  The line is always pretty long, but goes by quickly.  Good service and they have a guy directing people who don't like to pay attention to open registers.",

I got the Shake Stack - a delicious burger with a deep fried cheese stuffed portobello mushroom.  The bun was brioche like - very soft and delicious.  The bun is also a great concept - it is partially sealed on the bottom so juices don't go flowing everywhere.  The patty was flavorful and the veggies were fresh.  However, the portobello put it over the top and set it a part from all other fast food burgers.  The cheese fries were on point too - very crispy and just the perfect amount of cheese.  This was an amazing burger and lived up to its hype.    The service was great - employees were very friendly and the food came out fast.  It is such a bargain to be able to get a meal on the Strip for under $15.",

There's something about Shake Shack that makes it so good; maybe it's the soft steamy bun, the cheese, or the seasoned meat.  Or memories of New York... Whatever it is, Shake Shack is one of my favorite fast food stops in Vegas.    The ShackMeister, RoadSide, and Shroom Burger are some of the favorites I've tried; the hotdogs are pretty good too.  The sound of crinkle fries and nacho cheese doesn't sound too appealing, but at Shake Shack, is surprisingly good.    If you have room, try one of their delicious shakes; and if just looking for a drink, their lemonade is pretty awesome and resembles the lemonade from Hotdog on a Stick minus the hot girl churning lemons.    Can't wait for Shake Shack to come to Los Angeles.",

It's on that short list of places I've always wanted to try (along w/ Sonics, Applebees, 5 Guys, Chick-fil-A, etc) because we just don't have one in Hawaii. I can pass on something like Applebees, but when the Yelp Hawaii CM tells you to go visit Shake Shack on your visit to Vegas, then you do it! SUCH a good choice!  Where's it at? It's on the corner (outside) of the New York, New York hotel, across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe. They have indoor and outdoor seating, so spending a sunny day outside to nom could be nice! The inside is pretty modern, and there's a lot of seating.  Don't be scared of the line: They have stanchions set up to snake the line before you get to the ordering counter, and the line always fills the whole area set up for it. Don't fear! The line actually moves really quickly, and it's the perfect time to decide what you're going to order while you wait. They have a huge menu board set up next to the stanchions. Once you order, they give you a buzzer so you know when you're order is ready.  Food & Drinks: The burgers are yummy! The buns don't overtake the fillings, and the fillings are good...like, sure, I want bacon and cheese and peppers and tomato and lettuce and extra sauce! Oh, I can throw an extra patty and more cheese in there? Uh...YES! :D   They have burgers and they have fries, but that's not what they're known for, not really. Shake Shack is known for their shakes and frozen custards! What's the difference between regular run-of-the-mill ice cream and frozen custard? Frozen custard has eggs and cream and is made into a thick custard first before being frozen; regular ice cream is just heavy cream and flavoring generally frozen from its liquid state. In other words: frozen custard is MUCH richer (it's because of the eggs). The point is that you MUST get the frozen custard! You can get it plain or you can go all out and get it with the mix-ins, which is definitely the way to go!  FYI, this fast food burger joint also sells beer & wine! Don't be surprised, it's Vegas lol. They even have beers on tap! Obviously, must be 21+ to order that. :P  Conclusion: I totally wish we had one in Hawaii...man, it would be SO popular.",

Nothing special. Could've made it at home. Would've thought their base stuff would be at least decent. Nope. A whopper or  something from Wendy's would've been better. It was small and too simple for the price. Its more like In and Out nothing flashy. GOOD!? Get out of here.   Had to try a shake. Went with red velvet shake. Not bad. Good I liked it especially after walking the strip on a 100 degree kind of day but nothing special. Taste like a red velvet shake from anywhere else that serves it. Small and simple for the price once again. Strip price!? Maybe.  The atmosphere is pretty chill, I like it. They have nice inside with tvs and mostly spacious dining. Tables have lots of elbow room but back to back a little tight depending on who sits next to you. They have some seatings outside too.  I'm sure this place is good and I'm probably not only person to come in knowing nothing about the place but who's fault is it for my experience the employee or mine. Anyways I might try them out again but not anytime soon unless I hear about something I really have to try.  Easily accessible when walking along the strip but not so if your driving cause you have park at the nearest casino and walk.",

I don't understand what's so great about the cheese crinkle fries.. It was literally just like fries with nacho cheese on top. Definitely not worth the money.   My BF got the roadside burger which was like a double cheeseburger with grilled onions. It sounded and looked good BUT he didn't enjoy it. He said if he were to get In N Out instead, he would have enjoyed that more. Ha ha I agree!   Honestly... These burgers are mediocre and lack so much in flavor. They could do better.  Another downside about this place.. It's always packed and it's difficult finding seats indoors. Outdoor seating is available but wtheck I need air conditioning too man.",

I ordered the Smoke Shack and it was so good and full of flavor.   There was a bit of a mix up with my order, but it was easily fixed without issue and a big plus which I very much appreciate.    Having tried the Shake Shack in Central Park these burgers seemed small in portion and of course since its Vegas the price is also steep.",

Partly because I love In N Out and also because I had never tried Shake Shack and felt left out. We ended up here for lunch on a recent trip to Vegas. I was really excited to finally try it out... I hate to say it, I was not impressed.   We walked in at 1pm. There was a pretty long line, but went by pretty fast. I ordered their Shack Burger with cheese fries. The burger was very small and lackluster. The bun was chewy and doughy.  The meat tasted fresh and I think I remember some form of sauce, which was good, not great. Their cheese fries were pretty disappointing to me. It seems like they had just defrosted some curly fries that came in a bag you get from Costco, slapped on a Kraft cheese slice, microwaved it and charged me $4 bucks. How anyone can compare these fries to animal style fries worries me.   I finally tried it, so I'm happy, but I will probably not come back. I personally prefer In N Out. Much better food, portions and pricing.",

Hearing all the rave reviews from friends, it was on the top of my Must-Eat-List on a recent trip to Las Vegas.  Conveniently located outside the New York New York Hotel and Casino, Shake Shack is known for their long lines.  As we waited, my dad was in awe of why all these people would wait and laughed that it was just a burger.  But then he had his first ShackBurger.  He admitted that it was very good and that the sauce really set it apart.  I totally agreed.  While the burger is on the small side (I could easily eat two!), it is made from 100% all-natural Angus beef and cooked to medium (unless you request otherwise, but don't you dare!).  I absolutely loved the soft potato roll it's served on.  The crinkle cut fries were delicious as well.  Didn't try a shake, but saving that for next time.  Definitely worth the wait at least once in your life!",

    "text": "I've heard about Shake Shack a while back and have been meaning to give it a shot and so when I found out there was one in LV I was excited to try it. So excited that I got the whole shabang - a black & white shake, cheese fries, and double shackburger - for a whopping $19 thinking it would be enough for 2. Oh boy was I wrong.   The double shackburger was really good and juicy. I loved the sauce and taste but it was puny AF. It looked a bit smaller than the In out one but for triple the price. I finished my half in 3 bites and then moved onto the fries in hopes of finding more for my belly. Those crinkly fries were good and an average size. The black and white shake was not what it was sought out to be - a vanilla milkshake with chocolate sauce swirled in. It might as well been just a straight up chocolate shake. After this snack, I was left with wanting more but did not have the dough to fulfill my cravings. Even if I bought another burger I doubt that I would have been full anyway.   I like how this NY burger joint is located in the New York New York Casino across from MGM. Kinda cool :) The decor was nice and modern. Service uh was a tidbit rude at the cash register.  Long story short: great tasting but puny burgers And for that reason In N out will be my first choice.",

I can't describe it, likes like slightly buttered and grilled and is soft to the bite. It works. The sauce they put in the burger is so good. It's like this creamy aioli sauce. It really ties the burger together. I got the the shake burger, it's not super huge and it's around $5 something. So it's not the most cheapest burger but not expensive as well, just wished it was a little bigger for the price. I could of ate two and I'm a small person. Give it a try!! Wonderful burger.",

    "text": "This Shake Shack restaurant is conveniently located on the LV Strip on the outside of the NYNY Hotel on the corner closest to the Park MGM hotel. I live in NorCal and heard a lot of hype around this East Coast based establishment, so my family and I decided to give this try. From my overall experience based on guest services and food quality, I'm giving this Shake Shack location a solid 4 Stars. My wife and u ordered the Shake Shack burger and fries. If i can compare this to In and Out's burger, the Shake Shack burger was a tad more juicy and flavorful. The Shake Shack fries (thick, crinkle cut and crispy) are like night and day compared to In and Out's fries(thinner cut, not as crispy, but not as oily, if that makes sense). Food overall is a 5. The guest services I'd give a 3. The ordering part was fine and seamless. It was the pick up part with the buzzing pager that killed the service. When my pager buzzed, i figured my food order would be ready. That was not the case. I still waited by the pick up counter for close to 5 minutes after the pager buzzed. The nice lady at the pick up counter just kept on assuring me, my order was on its way. As to why i was paged so early when the order wasn't even close to being ready, was beyond me. Stupid. In summary,  food wise, come and get it. Guest services wise, this place is hit or miss. I'll probably still come back here, especially after a concert at Park MGM or T Mobile Arena.",

We're from California so everyone knows the West Coast favorite is In and Out. The first thing I noticed was Shake Shack's larger menu. They have singles and doubles like In and Out but they also offer chicken, hotdogs and a family favorite- crinkle fries. They also have a variety of shakes and custards.  Now for the great debate. All of the food was good. The burger was warm, flavorful, slightly greasy, served with lettuce, tomato and shack sauce between soft buns. Did I like it?  Yes. Was it better than In and Out? In my opinion no. It's personal preference really. I've just been spoiled by large stacked burgers, toasted buns and large slices of fresh lettuce, onion, tomato and In and Out sauce. Would I eat Shake Shack again- heck yea! Shake Shack's fries are better than In and Outs, I loved their crisp crinkle fries topped with cheese. Their chocolate milkshake was thick with just the right amount of sweetness. We're back home in California so I guess I won't be having any Shake Shack anytime soon unless we go on a trip to the E. Coast or back to Vegas!",

As a matter of fact, this appears to be the only Shake Shack on the Strip. You can easily get here if you are staying in any of the several hotels nearby.   The food, specially the burgers and the fries, are amazing and you can taste that it is made with quality ingredients. You can't beat a Double Shackburger with a side of Cheese Fries and a pint of ShackMeister Ale. Plus, the prices are exceptionally reasonable compared with other food joints in Vegas. Two people can have a proper meal for less than 30 bucks.  Service is above average.  During our stay in Vegas they had this special oktoberfest-themed menu, from which I had the chance to order a Bratburger (Hamburger topped with a flat-top griddled Usinger's cheddar-stuffed bratwurst, crispy ShackMeister Ale-marinated shallots and ShackSauce) and the aforementioned ShackMeister Ale. \"Sehr gut!\"",

During the most recent visit I ordered the Shroom Burger (Crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce) and fries. The mushroom was interesting and not bad but the cheese was extremely hot and messy every time I took a bite. Don't get me wrong, everything was good but it just wasn't anything special.   One thing I liked was the outside seating right on the strip. If it isn't summer, it is nice to sit outside and people watch while you're eating.  To me, if you're craving a fast food style burger, there are better options nearby.",

So, naturally, once Shake Shack opened here in Vegas, I went back to my reliable order and was not surprised.   Shack burgers are made with great quality beef, they use antibiotic and hormone-free Angus beef, I believe. And you can taste the quality of all of their other ingredients that make your meal. The burger is juicy, its cheesy, charred, and delicious.  Although the price point is a little high, I think the people who are skeptical of Shake Shack should at least give a try once.",

I got a shroom burger which is a deep fried mushroom filled with cheese but there was barely any cheese in it. I'm not even sure it was in my burger.   I also got the cheese fries but the fries were super oily. I didn't even finish them.   Shake shack has really good food and even though it's pricey and has small portions, it's absolutely delicious and worth it. HOWEVER I was really disappointed with the shake shack here, especially since it's the closest one available to the west coast.",

I ordered the single shack burger, cheese fries, and vanilla shake. It was pretty damn good. It made me full easily. The fries were crunchy and the shake was thick and creamy, just how I like it! Lmao. However, you have to pay for everything separately. You can't pay for anything as a full meal so I'd say it's kinda pricey for just a burger, fries, and a drink. My friend got the shake stack burger and she was almost halfway done eating it when she noticed a piece of long hair stuck to the meat and cheese. Kinda bad for trying a new place for the first time.  She complained about it and they made her a new burger AND she got a refund AND free custard! What great customer service! I'll for sure be back next time I go to Vegas.",

    "text": "Those burgers doe... The Shack Burger is probably one of the best burgers I've ever had.  And let's just get this out if the way: they are nothing like In-N-Out's burgs and quite frankly, not like any other burg I've ever had. The buns share the consistency of a King's Hawaiian roll, soft and squishy but not sweet like one. The patty is thin and flavorful, the cheese is basically Kraft American singles and melty, and the sauce is a pickle-ketchup-mayonnaisy mixup. Crinkle fries were good - they're kinda like Del Taco fries, only a little crunchier.   I was disappointed in the shake though, we got the \"black and white\" and it was nothing to write home about. I took 2 sips and was over that shizz.   The 'Shack is pretty expensive ($28) for 2 cheeseburgers, 1 fry and 1 shake, with small portions for the price. Don't get me wrong: I'm cool with small portions, as long as the price tag matches. That burger was great but everything else about the meal, meh. This place is also pretty packed, so be prepared. We waited in a long line for about 30-40 minutes at lunchtime. I didn't take pictures of the food because I was too busy stuffing it into my face...my bad for that. There's plenty of really good pictures in other reviews so please do scroll on.  Cool find for you grillers out there: my boyfriend found an awesome Shake Shack burger recipe hack, and it was probably the best burger I ever ate when he made it, so we were pretty excited to try the real deal. Here is the link if you want to try making them yourself, pretty epically yummo:  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Ffood%2Fhack-shake-shakess-burger-it-might-seem-crazy-80179725512.html&s=95420a0a84ce3de8b1281cf5f2d73fc631991a6daee1c132ab83703ac687e4da\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yahoo.com/food/hack-shak...</a>",

It's a well-known gourmet fast food joint in New York, so they decided to open one in New York New York @vegas. Much clever~~  FOOD: 1) Shack Stack-- ($9.49)  I thought this was the best thing on the menu! The fried portobello mushroom literally melted in your mouth. If you're not fond of mushrooms, you shouldn't order this bc the taste of the mushroom is infused into the cheese. The buns are buttery and crispy when bitten into & the party is cooked to perfection (medium to medium rare to be exact)  The actual burger is the size of a regular burger that you can order from in-n-out (maybe even smaller). But the height of the burger is 3.5-4 inches! You better open your mouth wide for this !!   2) Smoke Shack-- (single: $6.69) Shake Shack is also popular for their bacon! It had a smokey applewood taste to it. The burger also included pickled sweet red peppers which gave it a tangy-ish taste!   3) Chicken Dog-- ($4.50)  The texture was pretty chewy... And not worth the $4.50 in my opinion. The overall taste wasn't all that great either. It was smokey with a weird aftertaste. It didn't come with any condiments. No ketchup, mustard, relish, or anything. It was just the sausage and the hotdog bun -__-   Buttttt overall, I really really REALLY enjoyed this place. I mean, it's famous in New York for a reason right ?",

The patties are 100% beef with no fillers. The patties are bigger than In n Out and Five Guys. The meat is flavorful, grilled, and browned on both sides. It comes with lettuce,  tomatoes, and Shake sauce. The fries are crinkle type made from Yukon potatoes. The shake are so good! I had the vanilla malt and it was had just the right consistency to suck through the straw. If they opened one here, I would not think about going to another fast food burger joint. It's that good!",

    "text": "mmm great burgers! I actually really enjoyed shake shack. I got the shackburger, fries, and the shack attack with vanilla custard instead of chocolate. I know a lot of people think this place is overhyped but I loved it. The shackburger was really simple, the quality was great, the patty wasn't dry and it wasn't greasy at all. I really enjoyed dipping my fries into the shack attack for some reason, I like the mix of sweet and salty together. As for the shack attack, it was pretty good too! However it's just a better made McDonald's vanilla cone. I really liked the fudge it came with but the chocolate chunks it also came with made it too sweet so I would prob wouldn't ask for that again.   Overall I'm definitely coming here everytime I go to Vegas! I kept trying to like Earls Sandwiches and everytime I was disappointed.",

I  love the Shackburger with cheese crinkle fries! The shakes are seriously make-you-get-off-your-diet delicious.   I love that this location closes at 2am! I even got Shake Shack delivered via Postmates before! That was fun.  I usually park at New York, New York and walk through the casino to get the this location but now that the T-Mobile arena and park area is open, I can park at Monte Carlo and walk through that side street to get to Shake Shack.   People watching is definitely fun at this location. There is outdoor seating complete with water mists to keep you cool. However. the water mists do nothing on those 100+ degrees days.  Tip: If you are an M-life baller (\"noir\" level or whatever), there is a separate VIP line for you. I'm not one but wish I was!",

Quality meat and bun for sure however the meat is thicker than average burger so be prepared to deal with the feeling of having eaten too much grease.   Fries were very good and crispy although I still prefer McDs or in n out fries. Also tried the shackago hot dog which was very good. Unique tasting hot dog and something I would definitely try again.   Overall highly recommend this burger and considering that the price is reasonable I think in n out burger finally has a legit competitor (outside mom n pop burger joints)",

It's the little things that count in the end. And the team, the staff, the \"family\" behind the counter and working the line REALLY liked each other - that is SO rare.  High, high marks SS.

The burger was delicious, the fries were indescribable, and the shake was the cherry on top. I gave them 4 stars because the food was great and the price was decent, however the shake was pricey. Almost $6 for a small shake is insane to me when it is similar to an in n out shake I can get for less than $3. It was also hard to find a place to sit, but that may be because of its prime location on the strip and the tendency to be cheaper than most restaurants on the Vegas strip. Overall- good food, reasonable price.",

After 2 days of in n out, I would say that the burger at shake shack was more impressive as they had juicier patties and the shack stack which I ordered had the most succulent deep fried portobello mushroom I've ever had!  The shakes. I ordered the peanut butter shake which was so creamy and fragrant it was like having peanut butter right out of the jar but smoother and not as sweet. Definitely one of the better milkshakes I've had.  In comparison to in n out overall, I would definitely choose shake shack anytime. I've had enough burgers for this trip, but so glad I ended it off with shake shack. I still haven't found a burger that totally awed me, but this is close enough!",

Whatever burger you crave for, YOU SERIOUSLY CANNOT MISS!  First, I tried the Shroom burger because I wanted to try something different that most fast food restaurants don't have. It's safe to say I fell in love in love at first bite. Then I had the Chicken shack burger that had a sauceless slight spicy kick to the chicken which was just amazing. I loveeee spicy food & would normally go for any item that sounds spiciest on the menu. HOWEVER..  ...I finally tried their Shack burger! Their classic burger was the best one yet, which surprised me. Wayyyy better than In-N-Out or any other fast food restaurants. Their beef was just so juicy & contained a lot of flavor; I almost felt like I was eating a gourmet meal! For the rest of the trip, I stuck w the Shack burger. Even got one before I left to the airport & another to-go for when I got back home to Seattle. That's how you know it's real lol I'm drooling just thinking about it",

We got a root beer float, black and white milkshake with burger and fries. Burger is kinda small and crinkle fries weren't bad. It's hard to rate this place after having Bachi's gourmet burgers. But it does feel comparable to in n out.  Overall it does its job and hits the spot. I wouldn't mind coming again while in Vegas. Especially since they're open till 2am. Good late night snack. So many different things to try on their menu!",

I have wanted a Shack burger since I went to NYC, but did not have enough time.  On our last day of our Vegas trip, we stopped by here for lunch. I ordered a Shack Burger with no cheese and my cohort ordered the Smoked Shack.  As people that grew up with In-N-Out, I have to say that Shake Shack is slightly better. We also ordered the Shac-ago Dog and some fries.   I like that Shake Shack doesn't put too much sauce, but just the right amount. The bun was fluffy and I think a potato bread. It had the nice amount of lettuce and tomato (In-N-Out sometimes put too much lettuce). The patty was a nice portion around 1/3 lb and the fries (crinkle) and was the perfect end to the trip.   However, I still love Super Duper in SF the most, for my burgers.",

What makes it just as good as their West Coast rival is their BUN and BEEF.  It's a freshly made bun which doesn't over-bear but still has a great texture firmness and flavor to it.  The beef is moist, juicy and in perfect ratio to all the other ingredients.   Love the ice creams, the concretes, the shakes, and they even serve Craft Beers!",

The Smoke Shack burger and Cheese Fries are my go to. Shakemeister Ale and Shake Shacks wine goes great with all meals as well. I highly recommend this place, The burgers are always juicy and flavorful, Never dry and dull.",

    "text": "This place is delicious. When Shake Shack opened in Vegas I was so excited because the one in NYC is a staple of fast food in that area. It tasted similar to NYC if not the same, and I enjoyed every bite.   I admit it - I am a sucker for some good crinkle cut fries, and the ones at Shake Shack do not disappoint! Perfectly salted and fried to a crisp, but not too much so they're overly greasy. However, I did have their special fries earlier this month with cheese sauce and bacon and they were painfully salty. I was definitely puffy from all the salt for a few days.   Their shakes? Amazing. Simply amazing. All of them are fabulous. Grab one and then go across the street to the AC Store for a mini of Bailey's or a delicious dessert vodka to make it extra happy.   It doesn't matter which burger we get, each of them are delicious. My husband likes the Shake Shack with the fried mushroom or whatever it is and he is in Heaven each time he gets it.   I get the hamburger or cheeseburger either wrapped in lettuce or on their gluten free bun. Let me tell you something. They have the most delicious, squishy, buttery gluten free bun I've ever had. Their buns make me remember why I missed bread so much when my gluten allergy was at its worst over a decade ago. Perfect meat to bun ratio, and a delicious bite each time.   For the price, it is great. We always take friends there when they're in town. Great location too! Friendly staff, good food, and good times!",

Place is that crowded when it comes to sitting indoors as well, but I like the variety of food and shakes, especially the ones infused with alcohol.  Hehehe... There's also a couple items listed for dogs! Maybe I'll bring my spoiled princess here some time in the future.",

The burgers were juicy and flavorful and the fries outstanding. It made me feel like high school fries but upgraded to adult style.

Anyways, this place is not bad. I just don't think the burgers have enough taste and krinkle fries are what your parents give you in elementary school. :/ I like their peanut butter shake though!   Reason for low review is that, there's nothing special about this place. Basic af. Also, the prices are ridiculously expensive for that exact reason. When I can get a meal at In N Out for 1/2 of the price and it tastes 4x better, you best know where I be.",

Only drawback? PRICEY! Smoke shack - Niman Ranch applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce... everything you want and need in a burger! So tasty - a little smokey, a little spicy, BACON, cheese, seasoned patty. Special burger of the month - eh, but when in vegas, carpe diem! It was a \"nacho\" burrito with jalapenos and all. A little too spicy and nothing else. Cheese fries - simple, clean, yes!  What else is served? Plenty - hot dogs, shroom burgers, turkey. Also, beer and wine (we'd had too much at that point, water for me!)  Only difference? The lovely sparkly vegas bedazzling that everything gets when you're on the strip.  Location: At the New York, New York casino and hotel, for the most obvious reasons, right?  Until next time, Shake Shack.",

The burgers are good, the wait can be a bit of a tiebreaker though because the line can get you waiting for your food for around 15 minutes. If you're not starving and want decent burgers that you don't have to wait hours for in the area (looking @ you Gordon Ramsay's Burgr), this might be worth a shot. Growing up in California and subsisting on in-n-out though, I must suggest going there instead (can't beat the price-to-value ratio).",

I came here on a super hot day and we came in here to escape the heat and grab a quick bite to eat.  I'm sure everyone was trying to do the same because it was pretty packed.  The line was long and took about 10 minutes to get to the front.  Finding a table to seat all 7 of us was tough even though the restaurant itself is relatively large.    I tried a burger, cheese fries and black and white milkshake.  I much prefer the fries from In N Out.  Thought cheese on top of crinkle fries would be revolutionary but I think I actually prefer it without the cheese.  The fries were just mehhh - I just prefer thinner fries I guess!  The burger was good from what I remember.  But what was worth coming back for sure was the milkshake! So creamy and indulgent...makes me want to go back and try all the other flavors!!",

Not as flavorful as In N Out, and quite small. I got the double and it was cooked very well, but the overall burger lacked good flavor and mouthfeel.   Now, the fries and custard are fantastic. Absolutely perfect. However, Shake Shack is known as a burger joint. They should ditch the burgers and sell fries and custard only.  After the meal I felt ripped off. And this is the reason I don't frequent Five Guys. If I want to spend that much on a burger I'll go to Flemings and get a steakhouse burger with oozing, dripping flavor.   And a note. This location ran out of \"shack sauce.\" How the hell do you run out of your special sauce?  Pretty lame.   All in all, try it once then head out to In N Out and feed your entire family with better tasting burgers for 20% of the cost.",

I ordered the shack stack and a side of fries.   Shack Stack: 4/5 stars. Delicious! Especially with that fried Portobello mushroom with cheese oozing out yummm. The burger was smaller than I thought it would be... so it's definitely a bit pricey considering it was almost $10. It also came out lukewarm--it would've been even better had it come out hot.   Fries: 3/5. Pretty standard fries. Came out nice and hot.   We came back the next day to try their concrete and I must say that I was immensely disappointed by it.  We ordered a vanilla with the truffle cookie dough mix in and a vanilla with strawberry puree mixed in. It wasn't really anything special and for about $4 a scoop I should've just gotten regular ice cream elsewhere.   Overall, I would come back for the burger but I would skip the custard and concrete.",

On a recent trip to Vegas, boyfriend and I were starving late-night, and nothing sounded better than a burger, so away we went on a 20min walk down to New York New York. The place was buzzing with people, but the order line was relatively short, so we placed our order (two shack burgers, fries, side of cheese sauce), and proceeded to wait. Roughly 10mins later, we were rewarded with juicy burgers on soft, squishy buns. It's amazing how something so simple (bun, beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sauce) can be so delicious.  If you're looking for something delicious, quick, and affordable on the strip, Shake Shack's your best bet.",

I think this is the best tasting value in Vegas.   I would love to be able to try all the other menus items. Will return. Tasty.",

I ordered the Shake Stack. A portobello mushroom filled with muenster and cheddar cheese serve on top of a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and the shakesauce on a potato bun. The burger was juicy, taste fresh and the bun was soft to absorb the beef burger. The crinkle cut cheese fries was just okay. Not a fan of the processed cheese topping. Overall quality was just okay and does not compare to our West Coast favorite In and Out. Also the price is higher than your average burger joints prices. Love the location, but not a fan of the food.",

Line tends to walk out the door but it goes by quickly. If it's your first time I highly recommend the Shack Stack. It's a combo of their cheeseburger + shroom burger. The portobello mushroom is fried crisply and filled with melted cheese. The buns are unique bc they're soft and eggy.   Frozen custard was practically melted like the one I had in New York :-( The weekly flavor was strawberry almond.  Taste is comparable to the chain in New York but everything was slightly more salty and the fries a bit oily. I would be back for the burgers!",

I've heard comparisons about it being better than a beloved SoCal burger chain, but I think it's an unfair comparison. Shake Shack is what I would consider a \"gourmet fast food\" burger whereas the other chain serves a typical fast food burger. Get it? Got it? Good! Ok, now that we've gotten that out of the way...   This particular Shake Shack is located within the NYNY Hotel & Casino compound and is STILL worth venturing to. Yes, even with all that traffic on the strip. They have plenty of variety to choose from whether you enjoy burgers or hot dogs which you can have accompanied with fries and cheese fries. They also have shakes and custards along with beer and wine. Yup! You read that right folks, BEER and WINE!!! What's not to love about a good old fashioned American meal of burgers and fries when combined with alcohol? You kidding me? NOTHING! Get here and get here now! Before the lines get even longer! ;)",

Food is pre-made sitting under heat lamps. Even the sodas were already in containers, losing their carbonation awaiting to be ordered.   Smokeshack - I'm so glad I ordered a double because they are small greaseballs! The bacon could have been crispier. The brioche bun was a nice touch but was soaking in the burger grease. It was a good burger, not great. I would equate it to a burger at Wendy's.   Cheese fries - the cheese was semi cold by the time I got my order.   Seating - limited. This place is really small.   20 minutes after dining at Shake Shack, I was siting on the toilet praying to  Jesus to make the diarrhea stop. Would I come back? No! In-N-Out wins this round hands down!",

Shake Shack is located next to New York New York on the Las Vegas strip.  I kind of think the location is not too favourable considering it's towards the end of the strip where nobody really stays or goes to.    But anyways, the food.  They offer a couple different burgers but they're all definitely on the pricier side.  We ordered the ShackBurger and the ShackStack. The ShackBurger was a regular cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatos and Shacksauce at $6 for a single.  It was okay.. nothing too special about it.  However, the ShackStack was a whole nother story!  Basically it was a cheeseburger version of the \"shroom burger\" with lettuce, tomatos and Shacksauce.  The crisp fried portobello mushroom was stuffed with ooey gooey melted cheese....  Hands down, amaaaaazing.  I seriously inhaled this burger and forgot I was supposed to split half/half with my boyfriend..oops :) Definitely lives up to the hype & I would highly recommend this burger!   The only thing I didn't really like was how fries & drinks were not included in the prices and that you had to order them seperately.  I mean, the Shackburger was already $6 while the ShackStack was $10 but I guess you can't really complain when in Vegas.  Would I come back? Yes, but only for that ShackStack burger.",

However, I did like how the ends were kind crispy. I also loved the sweet potato bun! It did become a little soggy but the sweetness was very unique!  Cheese Fries: Awesome crinkle fries with melted cheese on top. The cheese kind of tasted like those Ritz cheese dip with crackers that you ate as a snack in elementary school. I know that's super specific, but it did!!! I was expected a nacho kind of cheese. It was unexpected but I liked it!  Custard: Yeah, you've got to get this! It's a great dessert that's very rich and smooth. Perfect ending to your meal.  It's really expensive (like they all say) but I guess that's how it is in the east coast? Yes, I did compare it to In n Out and of course I love In n Out better. It's cheaper and I can't get over their secret sauce. However, Shake Shack does have its perks so I can't really compare these two totally different burger joints!",

Shake Shack opened up a restaurant in New York New York on the Las Vegas strip. I saw the long lines during peak times so I figured getting there at 11:00 am would beat the crowds. Well there was still a small line but it disapated as soon as they opened. I ordered the Double meat Double cheese, fries and a drink. It's about double the price as In n Out. The crinkle fries are crisp and tasty.  The burger was fantastic. The quality of the beef tastes like a prime steak house burger. The toppings weren't overwhelming. The bun was light and flavorful.

I didn't think the Cheese Fries or Bacon Cheese Fries were anything special as they could've used more toppings. The chocolate and vanilla Shakes were just the right thickness for straw versus spoon usage. The Concretes were a Blizzard-done-right -- mixed perfectly -- softer than ice cream, yet firmer than frozen yogurt. Service was fast, yet pleasant.

The stack shack has a fried portebello mushroom with a single burger. I got the double smoke shack. The smoke comes with two burgers on top of delicous bacon. The shake was ok.

I had to go back 3 or four times to have them fix my order once my food was ready....it took them over 15 minutes to fix the order....by that time everyone else was practically done eating....  I don't understand what all the hype is...the burger  was ur typical fast food burger with more cheese and fat....that all I could taste anyway..cheese and grease.  Bottle line...nothing special not worth the hype in my opinion!",

Having eaten at Burgr a couple days before, the basic shack burger was just not good, especially for a burger over 5 bucks. My burger was dry and just not that great.   Cheese fries were executed well though. Crinkle fries were surprisingly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.   Shake Shack's offerings are pretty much like In and Out, except their burgers are a little fancier and their shakes have real ice cream.  This location does have ample seating and great staff though. They'd walk by collecting trays and asking if everything was okay.",

My meal consisted of the Shack Burger (Double), side of fries, and large drink, totaling $16 and some change.  The burger was cooked very nicely. The red peppers atop the melty cheese and excellently seasoned patty were warm and soft, the bun slightly toasted, and the slightly sweet \"southwest\" style Shack sauce was a tasty and flavorful touch. The fries were fresh and crispy, cross cut style. The drink was a regular soft drink, nothing out of the norm.   The atmosphere was busy. It was a warm environment full of socialization. Not too loud as to not hear your company in normal conversation, but not too low as to give off a boring vibe.  The staff seemed to be friendly, clear and concise with my order, though this is a counter style restaurant so interaction is limited.  The only qualm I have with this place was with the price. It is definitely a more upscale burger joint, and much of the price could in all fairness be contributed to its location on the Las Vegas Strip, but I would not  allow that to prevent you from at least trying it once.  All in all, this dining experience was solid and pleasant to say the least.",

I had the double cheese burger and my wife had the hot dogs. Shake Shack  definitely makes the Burger the star, the meat patty is very good and with the melted cheese on it. The condiments are on the side which you can add on if you want. This burger is a must try!  Location - Here is the one star deduction Shake Shack is located on the strip which makes foot traffic their main business, either park at Monte Carlo or NY NY and walk from there to reach this place. So anyone local travelling with kids this might be something to consider.  Restroom - Clean   Service - This is a burger joint so dont expect too much you order from a window and you get a Vibration Device which signals your to pick up your order. Shake Shack does have servers that cleans up tables, assist you on throwing the trash and opens the doors for you.   Overall - If you want Burgers Definitely try Shake Shack!",

So being that we were in Vegas, and there is a Shake Shack here, we put it on our list of \"must try's.\"   I love a good burger, and I have to admit...I was a bit underwhelmed after having a Shake Shack burger. First let me say, the burger and fries were good. It just wasn't what I was expecting considering what everyone was telling me about their burgers.   I ordered the Shack stack which is a Shack cheeseburger with a fried breaded portobello mushroom. My wife and son had the Shack burger with cheese. We also ordered fries and a shake. My wife loved the shake. The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Again, I want to emphasize that the burgers were good. I was just expecting more. I would still definitely eat at a shake shack again, but I don't think I would list it as one of my favorites.",

A positive was their fries were crinkled and crispy and if there is one super positive thing about trying Shake Shack, was the SHAKE!  I loved the mud slide flavor. Not too thick, not too watery, it was perfect right from receiving it.   I liked the service to be honest, Clare was super nice and patient, explaining some menu items.

Central Park is a thing on the strip of Vegas because the buck stops here!  No more, you no longer were going to walk past another shake shack. Your pride in the burger joints like In n Out and Culver's and the occasional Five Guys kept you at bay.  You didn't even get a shake shack burger, you got a  shroom burger because you don't see that every day. You bite into it and it's crispy and juicy and cheesy. It's so good you don't even miss meat. Because that's the best vegetarian meal you've ever had and it comes from a burger joint. You then wash it down with an exclusive shake shack beer from Brooklyn brewing company, and then you notice that the table you're sitting at is a bowling lane refurbished out of Brooklyn.  You then have your shake tres leches de dulce leches , and then you realized you wasted two trips to New York because of pride. You have too much pride in Culver's burgers and frozen custard. That shake changed a lot of things for you after that, life changes. You then say I'll be back!",

    "text": "This place exceeded my expectations by far. As a die hard in n out fan, this place in my opinion is just a different category. The price is not comparable to Southern California fast food. It was pretty pricey, over $30 for two combos.   But the taste was amazing. The chewy, fluffy potato bun complemented the entire burger. Definitely get the one with the deep fried mushroom cheese bomb. It was crispy, gooey, and a perfectly cooked mushroom that made the burger over the top. Fries were solid-- definitely a great fast casual restaurant before going to a show close by at NYNY. Still doesn't compare to the price quality ratio at In N Out, but a must try.",

I went here while on a girls' trip and lucky for us there was no line when we arrived but there was a restaurant full of people eating.   I ordered the cheeseburger and fries, which I always love. Their hamburger buns melt in your mouth and their patties are seasoned well. My friends got the chicken sandwich, one loved it, the other one wasn't too impressed, but she loved the fries (even though she isn't usually a fan of crinkle cut fries), so that was a good thing.   Overall, I enjoyed every bit of my fatty goodness! I will be back!",

Going here for lunch was crazy...actually a lot of places on the strip for food was crazy but not impossible (to find seats). I ordered the smoke shack and a black and white shake. The burger was HUGE! The black and white shake was vanilla custard stirred with chocolate fudge. I was in heaven :D My coworkers ordered the double down fries, the mushroom burger and the regular shack burger. I would ask for help eating the double down fries, The bowl is HUGE. Us three gals finished it, but imagine if you were just one person eating it!! The mushroom burger was interesting and as my coworker described it, it was cheese filled and it exploded on her LOL.  Seats get filled fast, so make sure you have friends to help look for spots as you wait for food. Overall food experience was great~ Would definitely eat here again when I come back!",

We placed our order, one chocolate, one vanilla shake.  We were given a buzzer and was ushered down the row to the pick up side of the counter.  We waited about 15 minutes to get our shakes.  The shakes were super thick and delicious.  We opted to sit outside on the patio in the shade rather then battle the mass amount of people fighting for tables inside. The patio was nice and quite and the slight breeze made it bearable to sit outside.  We drank our shakes and headed back to the car. Great treat!",

Chicken shack was disappointing because the first time I tried it, it was super juicy and not overly fried. This time it was super breaded and fried, and the chicken was dry. It was a let down.   Shack stack was great, I would say the best you can order. It's a meat patty with the shroom burger patty (fried portobello with cheese). It's filling and so good.   Black and white shake was also so tasty! It's not overly sweet. It's a vanilla shake with fudge mixed in. A perfect blend of chocolate and vanilla.  Fries were really crispy and tasty.",

We ordered two burgers and their (new) chicken sandwich. PLUS the special Shackmiester Ale, brewed by Brooklyn Brewery. Which in case you didn't know is awesome! It pairs well with everything on the menu and is made ONLY for Shake Shack.   I have to say I wasn't impressed with the layout of the restaurant. I feel like a better layout could tremendously improve the flow. It felt a bit closed off, I feel like there wasn't enough counter space, and the condiments were near a bunch of tables. It was crowded.   HOWEVER, I love love love this establishment. I make it a point to locate a Shake Shack in every city I go to. The food is incomparable. The experience is incredible. Go to Shake Shack - do it!!!! You won't regret it.",

I feel like I've been secretly at war with everyone from the East Coast because we have In-N-Out, but I've been humbled. Once walking in I noticed the large wall that explains their specialty burgers, fries and shakes. So immediately my eyes fell in love with the shake shake stack, a burger nestled in a fried cheese party with all the burger fixins. Also went with then bacon cheese fries.   We took a seat and waited for our creations, surprisingly we were helped pretty fast considering we were at the Las Vegas location. Our burgers were dropped off table side and it took one look to know this was going to be delicious. The cheese fries were crispy and buried under a cheesy fondue with crispy salty pieces of bacon. Along with the fries the burger had this taste that couldn't compare to any, a perfectly charred burger under all the loads of fries and melted cheese, it was magical!",

My husband went all in and got the double Smoke shack with bacon and cherry pepper adding a tad more flavor to the burger $9.79.  The layout of the place accommodates the Vegas crowd nicely and boy do they whip through that line like nobody's business with tight buzzer control and have your food out in minutes after ordering.  Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, it's fast food, but I enjoyed their decor.  Customer service at the counter can be more friendly or offering more suggestions.  Now, let's get down to the burger and fries.  My crinkle fries definitely needed to be well done, because the normally cooked ones didn't cut it for me.  Not my bag of potatoes and yes shapes do matter.  I don't mind them, they're just not mind blowing.  The plain buns, similar and tiny to In N Out is smothered in the Shack sauce, topped with their burger, a nice leafy lettuce, and two slices of tomato.  Slight difference in their sauce, but signature even to rave about?  This is all subjective.  I got a tiny sample of the chocolate shake, and it was a little too sweet for my taste.  Coming back for more?  Definitely won't be my first choice.  We're on a mission to try all the burger joints and see how they stack up to my all time favorite.  TMI- A little burp about an hour later got me feeling like the burger was too greasy for my taste.  Not a good feeling either.",

I actually might even like it better because this location is more modern, eye-pleasing, and spacious compared to its NYC counterpart.   We pretty much ordered everything off the menu and dug in. I really like all of the burgers here and even though I prefer eating at In-n-Out I'm not to type to get into heated debates when comparing the two. They both make delicious burgers and it boils down to personal preference. Despite the long line during my recent visit, it moved smoothly and honestly, few things can beat munching down on a shack burger while sipping on beer under some shade on the Las Vegas strip.",

Shake shack really stood out to me. The flavor gives you a kick of freshness with the taste of rich cheese and a well cooked chicken breast. Things got even better when we tried the bacon cheddar cheese fries! The melted cheesed was Fire! And the bacon pieces gave it an amazing tase.    Overall, I really enjoyed shake shack!

Similar to people's unfailing love for In-N-Out, it was enough that we decided to try it and see what all the fuss was about.   I had the Shack Stack, a cheeseburger topped with the mushroom burger (itself stuffed with cheese, breaded and fried) and then topped with some mysterious ShackSauce. I have to admit, it was really good. It came out so fresh and piping hot, my friend burned his tongue while taking his first bite. The melted cheese inside is like lava! They cook the burger to your desired temperature which made the practically-raw-eating animals in my company happy. And it was nice that they had a vegetarian option, although I'm not sure if it's cooked separately from the meat (guessing not). The fries were crispy with soft centers. I also had their signature lemonade of the day, Strawberry-Mint. It was good but admittedly, a little sweet and less tart than what I prefer.   Most in my party finished off their portions and came away satisfied. However, we agreed it was all pretty heavy, even for burgers... We were in Vegas, didn't drink, and really felt all that grease! We are definitely getting old. So, solid choice for burgers and lemonade but maybe not after you've walked 22k steps on the Strip.",

There's a new store that's opening in Seattle, so thought I must try out this hype before committing to the craziness in Seattle.   We ordered the shroom, smoke burgers, and the cheese and bacon fries. It was really flavorful and awesome.   The only thing I didn't like was once you enter the establishment, there's a menu on the wall when you come in, but no menu at the register. So it gets a little complicated to figure out what you wanted to order for the whole group. Other than that, it definitely live up to its hype.",

    "text": "Shake Shack seems to have more buzz than its worth but if you are looking for just a good burger it is worth the visit.   I am a fan of burgers in general and was hungry so here I was. I ordered up the ShackBurger with cheese and fries. It was awesome. The patty practically melts in your mouth. I hardly put it down and just kept taking bite after bite until it was devoured. The krinkle fries were also very good.   This is a touristy area with the Park near by and T-Mobile arena. The vibe is fun with games out front and great people watching. Its not slightly back from the street so you don't feel overly crowded.   Getting in there will be a line but it moves quickly. Drinks are self serve except beer and wine they will take care of. After you order you get a pager that flashes and buzzes for your pick up. Pretty easy process actually but do know what you want to order by the time you get to the register because there is no menu over their head like most places. It's actually on the entrance line from the front door.  Food is good, atmosphere is fun and open. I would come back if staying in the NY NY or hotels adjacent.",

    "text": "What's not to love here?!  I was in Las Vegas for just a couple more hours and walked across The Strip JUST for this since Shake Shake has not yet made its way to Washington State.  Being first-timers, we kept things simple with the classic Shack Burger, side of fries and a coffee shake. The Shack Burger embodied everything I could possibly ask for in a burger. The patty was juicy and the freshly-ground, natural beef made all the difference. Topped with colorful leafy lettuce, tomato and zesty Shack Sauce, it was delicious!  Pairing the burger with crispy crinkle fries and a creamy shake made for a satisfying lunch.   The pricing here is a little higher than your typical fast food restaurant, but the quality is much better and it shows!  The service was also reasonably quick and friendly considering the lunch crowd at noon. We were about to bus our table, but one of the staff members gladly collected our tray for us instead - how considerate!  Located right next to the New York New York hotel, Shake Shack is a terrific lunch option along The Strip if you're looking for something quick and affordable. Treat yourself!",

Located in the vicinity of the New York, New York Hotel (a fitting location), adjacent to the T-Mobile Arena and the Park Theater so its a good spot for post concert or hockey game grub. I went right after seeing a concert in the Park Theater.  It is on par with the New York locations. It did not fail to provide that luxurious, rich, decadent flavor that just coats your mouth with every bite. I got my usual order of a Shack Stack (cheese filled mushroom on top of a regular Shack beef burger), cheese fries and a shake. A shake is a must, it provides a creamy, sweet antagonist to the robust flavors of the burger and fries.   On this trip I also ate at In-N-Out, which is a great burger itself, but Shake Shack is king of the burger jungle.   This location has adequate seating. We were able to get a table even with the concert crowd.",

I was pleasantly surprised and very happy with the food. The French fries are wavy yet crispy, the burgers are well balanced and just down right delicious.

Shake Shack is pretty much busy at every waking hour of every weekend, so if you're lucky enough to catch them during their slow season then it makes it even more worth it. Even though they've expanded to SoCal, I still find myself coming here because it's become part of a tradition for me. That, and because nothing beats walking the strip with alcohol that you can bring in and out with you.  I always get the Original Shack Burger but you'll have to remember to ask for your fix-ins or they won't put it in the burger. The shack sauce is amazing and always worth adding on, and the fries are a must.  As far as drinks go, I like to do a blend of a chocolate and strawberry shake or an orange cream soda float.   This is located on the exterior of the New York New York hotel and is easily visible on the strip. Overall, I would certainly recommend coming here because of the decent prices and amazing quality food.  (8/100 - 2018)",

    "text": "A visit to Las Vegas normally means a stop at Shake Shack just outside of New York New York (since they now have a few locations in Las Vegas). My trip in January 2018 was no exception.  In the evening, my colleague who had picked/suggested Twin Peaks to eat at the previous day asked if I wanted to have dinner together again. Even though I wasn't really hungry due to me having had a large buffet brunch earlier that day, I was thinking of dropping by Shake Shack so I told him that we could meet there. He had never eaten there before so I told him that it was great burgers (albeit somewhat expensive), good fries, and great shakes.  He asked me what I recommended and I told him that I normally order the Shack Stack which is a meat patty along with a mushroom patty in a burger and I also get an order of fries and a peanut butter shake. Even though I gave him my recommendations, he opted to go for his own thing (regular hamburger, vanilla milk shake, and fries). He mentioned that he couldn't believe that I recommended and spent over $10 (not including taxes) on just a burger. I told him that it was a very good burger.  For my order this trip, I decided to get the Shack Stack, fries, and instead of getting a peanut butter shake this time, I went with a float. Out of the float flavours, I decided to go with a creamsicle float. If you like orange creamsicles, I really recommend the creamsicle float.  After ordering and paying, they hand you a \"pager\" which you hold onto until it vibrates. Once it vibrates, you go up to the counter to pick up your items. The wait wasn't too longer and was a typical wait at any fast food restaurant.  As always, the Shack Stack burger was very good. The crinkle fries were good. The creamsicle float was very good and will probably be my drink of choice from now on when I visit Shake Shack.  Total price tag (including taxes) was $20.54",

Whoever was working at the Cashier on the night of Sunday Nov 13 ( It was the colored girl, nothing against people of color btw.), she must have been having a terrible night.  She was very rude and had that \"I hate my job\" attitude. Not a smile, not a thank you, NOTHING! Not what you want from someone taking your order. Thankfully, the food was good and what I have come to expect.   If she hates her job so much, here's a tip, QUIT!!!  Got to watch the Patriots Vs. Seahawks too in the restaraunt. Cool.",

Tourists galore and it fits within the hole idea of being \"in New York\" since it's located at the New York, New York Hotel.  If you take a taxi, you have to pretty much make your way onto the Las Vegas Strip outside.  Ordered a Single ShackBurger and Cheese Fries.  My gf got the Shack Stack and regular fries.  My ShackBurger was okay.  It reminded me of a Wendy's burger.  My girlfriend's Shack Stack is a burger with a big piece of breaded mushroom.  That was alright except for the fact that it's priced at $10.  Worth $10?  No way.  As for the Cheese Fries.  Eh.  Cheese sauce on crinkle-cut fries.  Didn't wow me.  The regular crinkle-cut fries, it works.  Not sure how people can compare this to In N Out.  This place reminded me of Wendy's.  Sorry.  Not to say I wouldn't come back.  It's not something I'd crave.",

Seeing what the hype was about I decided to try it with a few friends...I originally wanted the ShackMeister Burger as I heard it was the burger on their secret menu to try but they sold out of it...so if you actually do read this review keep in mind I didn't have their best item on their menu...that's like going to In-N-Out and not having the option to order Animal Style...  I ordered:   Shack Burger - IMO the best burger out of the two that I tried...tasted fresh but god damn them buns were heavy that Sir-Mix-A-Lot would fuck with them...  Smoke Shack - sounded good, looked good, however left underwhelmed as the mixture of cheese, cherry peppers and bacon tasted borderline fake...no idea but it wasn't just my tastebuds that were fooled as everyone ordered the same burger at the table....  Shack-cago Dog - Basically a Chicago dog that was decent  Crinkle Cut Fries - Nice break from regular fries....  Jackpot Concrete - I love frozen custard....the Jackpot has Belgian Waffles and many toppings you would put on Belgian Waffles....I fucks with this   I don't usually provide a whole lot of weight on service in my reviews but let me be clear...the service to Shake Shack was fuckin incredible and they make sure to take care of you it's just that with other options in this city the food fell short imo...",

The fried chicken was perfectly breaded.  It was so crispy and flavorful, without having too much batter.  The chicken was so juicy inside.  My boyfriend had the shack stack, and he loooved it.

The restaurant has ample seating, but even so, we were lucky in finding a spot on this visit.  I ordered a veggie mushroom burger(trying to step out of the box) cheese fries and a peanut butter and chocolate concrete. First off, the burger was abit on the small side for the cost. My first bite was just bread and the mushroom, which has good flavor, but abit dry. On the second I got the cheese and that was an amazing bite. The cheese fries were delicious and spot on. The desert was ok, not bad but definitely not the best shake type dessert I've ever had.  The food here was good and worth a visit for. They also have a large selection of draft beers to choose from. I will probably return if I'm back in vegas.",

While I agree the burgers and fries are awesome, I hardly think you can compare the two mainly because Shake Shack is much more expensive than In n Out. Two burgers, one fries, and a root beer float cost over $26 - that's not really fast food price, it's more of a sit down burger joint price. I did really like the crinkle fries though - it was so perfectly crispy, perfectly seasoned. My Shack Stack was also delicious, although the whole time I was wishing they'd put more sauce in it.  I'd honestly just commit blasphemy and bring In n Out sauce to put on the burger here. Now THAT would be the best burger ever.",

    "text": "Ney York, is this all you got? I can't believe people are comparing this place to In-N-Out Burger. You can get a Double-Double combo for about $6 bucks at In-N-Out while a Double Shack Burger is $8 bucks a la carte.   I ordered the Shack Stack which is the cheeseburger with the cheese stuffed mushroom all in one. $10 bucks.   Burger was too salty. I couldn't taste the meat due to the giant battered and cheesy stuffed mushroom overpowering the meat. So the meat to cheese to bun ratio was way off in this burger. Does not live up to my expectation of what a $10 dollar burger should taste like.  Girlfriend ordered the double Smoke Shack: Double bacon cheeseburger. $10 bucks.  Burger again was too salty. She got 2 patties so this time the meat to bun ratio was much better. The pickled red peppers with its acidity balanced well with the richness of the melted cheese and bacon. Not a bad burger but not a $10 dollar burger by any means.  Fries: Probably the highlight of the meal. These are crinkle cut fries with just the right amount of crunch on the outside and they are thick enough that you get some chewy potato on the inside. Decent sized portion for $3 bucks.  Summary: Burgers are overpriced by $4 bucks. If you're comparing this to In-N-Out then do yourself a favor and get In-N-Out, you get the same size/type of burger at the price that it's worth.   If I was to spend $10 on a burger, then I'd go to Bachi Burger instead. Take notes Shack Shack, Bachi Burger is what a $10 burger should look and taste like.  TLDR: $10 price tag, $5 dollar burger.",

This location is by New York New York, and although there is a line out the door, the line goes by pretty fast because the workers regulate it quite well.  There are both indoor and outdoor seating, so it's not a huge deal trying to find somewhere to eat.  It's a fast ordering layout and you can customize all your orders which is fun and delicious!  Although it was busy, the worker that took my order had a huge smile on wanting to help us make our lunch items perfect for what we wanted to try.  We ordered the classic single shake shack burger, smoke shack, cheese fries, and their black and white shake to share. I loved their burger meat because they weren't packed tight, making the meat flavorful and perfectly cooked. The burger was honestly cooked and paired perfectly with all the fixings and my boyfriend definitely loved his smoke shack as well. The smoke shack also comes with bacon and chopped cherry peppers, which adds a really good flavor to their burgers as well. If you're a HUGE meat person, you can also order the burgers as a double portion.  I loved their cheese fries: Simple, crisp, with smooth and creamy cheese on it!! I rarely find a place that cooks crinkle cut fries very well, but their fries were perfectly crisp but fluffly on the inside.  I love oreo flavored milkshakes anywhere, but Shake Shack's black and white shake definitely hit the spot: cold, creamy, and velvety.  If you're in any town that has a shake shack right around you, I definitely recommend trying it out! The food was delicious at a good price in Vegas, and you can never go wrong while you're walking along the strip if you're near that area!",

Then they buzzed us with the buzzer they gave us and thought we were getting food, but all they did was talk more about the grilled onions and why they don't have it... Like, why would you tease me with that buzz? I was over the grilled onions already, geez.  * They did have bomb crinkle cut fries though.  * Burger was good, just not as good as I was expecting.

A few thoughts: - They have a special ale that Brooklyn Beer makes for them and it's really good. - I'm normally not much of a fan of crinkle-cut fries, but these are SO crispy on the outisde and perfect inside that they've converted me. - The cheese fries are an A+ variation. Not super cheesey tasting, yet somehow just right. - Not fan of their burger sauce, so maybe consider getting it on the side if you're on the fence about opaque condiments like I am. (For taste calibration purposes, I love In-n-Out spread and tartar sauce. SS sauce has an off-putting flavor I can't put my finger on.) - Hit the C window for a beer to drink while you wait in line, or to get a perfectly cold concrete for your walk to the slots.",

    "text": "I've been hearing great things (or rather, seeing great pictures on IG) about Shake Shack for a while, and I finally got to visit this past weekend.   My family and I tried to swing by for lunch on Saturday, but a gas line in NYNY broke, so all the restaurants there weren't able to cook anything. That meant no burgers. Boo. The next day, I called ahead (no long wait on the phone!) and was able to talk to the manager, who i believe is named Paul, and I confirmed that they got their griddles fixed!   So we got to Shake Shack right when it was supposed to open at 11:00am, but I guess they decided to open earlier to make up for lost sales the previous day because there was already an impressive line. No biggie though, the line moved so quickly that my group wasn't even ready to order when we got to the front.   I liked that there were plenty of options on the menu, but it wasn't overwhelming. I ordered the SmokeShack burger, cheese fries and a root beer float. They gave us one of those vibrating restaurant pagers while we waited. The food came out in a reasonable time seeing how busy it already was. When we got our food, I felt like the burgers seemed smaller than I thought they would be. The SmokeShack still tasted great though! Love the bun and cherry pepper. The fries were my definition of perfect fries. Golden and crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The root beer float tasted like your everyday root beer float, should've ordered a shake seeing how it is called Shake Shack, but I'll do that next time.  Awesome that they have an express line (C-Line) for drinks and cold items as well as a little Photo Booth that they make gifs out of apparently.  Definitely would love to eat here again!",

And I can get an equally excellent burger for much less $$ at In-N-Out.",

If I'm paying $40 for a couple of burgers, waiting 20+ minutes for the order, & driving/parking on the dreaded Vegas strip, it better have a \"wow\" factor.

It was small, and VERY greasy (I had to tear pieces of the bun off because they were soaked in grease), the meat had no flavor at all (hear of salt?).  The meat was slightly pink, and it just seemed under cooked.  My husband had the chicken sandwich.  It looked good, so I asked for one bite.  It was even greasier than my burger, and it tasted like burnt grease.  To top it all off, I was looking forward to a chocolate shake, but the shake machine was down.    Note to management:  get a second shake machine just in case the first one is inoperable.    I would recommend any other burger place over this one.  I will never return.",

Especially like the shack it was was chocolate cake mix, probably the highlight of the visit. I'm surprised they don't have more shake shacks around, this was a really nice experience. Food wasn't too greasy or overpowering. Usually when you enjoy a meal like this you want to take a nap afterwards, yet this didn't give that appeal.

The shakes were pretty good too.  Pricing of the burgers were decently priced.  I think the fries were expensive for what it was.  The way it works is that you order from the counter.  You're given a notifier for your order.  Once it's ready, you pick up your food at the counter.  Dining area was clean.  There are LCD TVs throughout airing sports.  All in all, great burger.  I'll be back.  Given the location, you would figure they would be open late.  On the weekends, they're open until 2am.  Sunday through Thursday, they close at midnight.  You're on the Strip!!!  We just came out of a Cirque show around 1100pm.  By the time, we got out of Mandalay Bay, it was about 11:45pm and was sad to find out Shake Shack closed at Midnight.  Bummer.  But I made it at opening time before our flight back home.  TIP:  Hook up to NYNY's WiFi for free",

I don't really get the comparison with in n out and while looking at other reviews, it seems as that is the case... While in n out is good, I don't think there is much to compare...   Both establishments make a decent \"plain\" burger... I do think that the shake shack patties have a little more flavor than in n outs... Also, in n out fries taste like cardboard, idk how anyone could like those... Shake shack crinkly fries are good and so I guess that's where my comparisons end... In my opinion, I would rather hit up shake shack then get in n out...   But enough about that...  I had the single Shackburger which comes standard with lettuce, tomato, and shake sauce... I also had an order of fries and the meal was good!   The size of the single Shackburger is a little on the small side so with that said, next time I would go for the Double... They're small but not White Castle small...  Next time I hope to try the Double, the cheese fries, and a shake....",

    "text": "THANK YOU AGAIN, VEGAS FOOD GOD!  First, you gave us Earl of Sandwhich. And now....Shake Shack!!!  Shake Shack is New York's version of California's In & Out (kinda).  It's considered a fast food joint like In & Out, but the burgers are a bit more gourmet (the bun is soo squishy and soft, noms).  Shake Shack is also a bit more hefty on the wallet for a fast food place.    I ate a meal at a Shake Shack in New York in 2011, and I seriously have been daydreamin' about eating it again someday.  Someday came when I randomly had a 3 hour layover in Vegas a few weeks ago and boom!  I took a cab (which was quadruple the price of my meal roundtrip) to recreate my love at first bite.  What can I say, love makes you do crazy things.  If you're in Vegas, experience a little bit of New York and order a ShackBurger, Cheese Fries, and a STRAWBERRY custard shake.  (Don't be tempted by other flavors...strawberry!  And if you fall victim to ordering something else, don't say I didn't warn you).  Just a heads up...this meal is about 1500 calories and $23.00 ish.    Fat belly, skinny wallet...but worttttth it.",

I will probably come here every time I'm in Vegas.  The only weird thing is the way their ordering system works.  The buzzer shouldn't go off unless the food is ready to be picked up.  My buzzer went off to go to the counter and get my food but I still had to stand and wait for a few minutes; it didn't make sense but once I tasted my food I didn't care anymore.  Better ingredients, lots of seating, and of course, very yummy burgers!",

I got a new burger with pattys fully cooked but the peppers on the top were ice cold causing the meat to get cold in the center. My friends food was also undercooked and she had already taken a few bites. The worst part is the pricing for the food, so much money for barely anything fries, burgers, and drinks are charged separately. I do not recommend going here at all.",

The customer service is awesome! The burger is amazing I love it!!",

    "text": "This was my first time at Shake Shack, ever (we don't have them where I'm from) & my first time in Las Vegas, period. My husband & I had been looking forward to checking out what all the fuss was about, and so we stopped in for dinner, the night before St. Patty's day, since we hadn't planned on being on the strip at all the next day. (We're not really into Vegas, we were there on a business trip) Like all places on the strip, it is busy, a line out the door, but we were determined. We actually kind of felt like we were in the soup nazi's line from that episode of Seinfeld, we just wanted to go up one at a time, order correctly, and move forward.. I decided to try the chicken shack, as I don't eat burgers, and the cheese fries, with a literal bottle of wine Lol & my husband had the regular Burger, regular fries & a lemonade, well, we were not disappointed~ I enjoyed my chicken sandwich very much, but the real winner was the cheese fries, I would describe their cheese as macaroni and cheese cheese, on top notch crinkle fries, and they were absolutely delicious! My husband says his Burger was the best Burger he's ever had & even the plain crinkle fries he insists are the best fries. I had wanted to try the chicken dog when we went back later in the week, but they said they were all out, but no worries, I'll gladly gain 10 pounds for another shot at those cheese fries, so I just had the same thing all over again & loved it just as much. Overall, I loved Shake Shack, and while I doubt I'll ever find myself in Las Vegas again, if I come across another shake shack somewhere else in the wild, I'll be all over it! Yum yum yum!!",

    "text": "Ah yes Shake Shack. I heard about this place through some East Coast youtubers who rave about it and knew they had one in Vegas so I hyped it up to my friends and made us walk all the way across the strip to get here (near New York- New York). The exterior building is pretty cool and when we got there it was late lunch but there was a decent line that went by pretty fast. We waited about 5ish minutes in line before we could order, which wasn't bad.   I ordered the original shake burger (I think that's what it's called?) a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato with their supposed shake sauce. I also got fries to share with my friend. We grabbed a wooden table in which I appreciated the decor and waited for our food via an electric beeper. Didn't take long before our group got our order.  Honestly, when I got the plate I felt a little underwhelmed. I expected so much and it looked like a small, regular cheeseburger. Now I must admit that the meat is juicy itself and was well made compared to the likes of In-N-Out, however it was just so small for the amount that it was that I just couldn't justify it. I could barely taste the shake sauce and even began wondering if there were any in my burger. I finished it in no time and started on the fries, which I must admit was pretty good. But that doesn't make up for the fact that the cheeseburger was just so...ordinary.   I thought this place was too hyped up and would not come back again unless it was for the fries. Would prefer In-N-Out way better, but it was nice to say I tried it!",

Friend in town had eaten here a couple days before I went. He wasn't impressed, but I was going to try it anyway. Everybody has different tastes, right?  Well, he was pretty much right on his opinion. Not a huge line at mid afternoon, but it was almost to the door inside. Ordering was pretty quick tho. Got the shake burger, with cheese and bacon added. Order of cheese fries, and a drink, not big on shakes, but in hindsight should'a checked one out.  Took almost 20 minutes for my order. Don't have to worry about overeating here, burger, fries, especially the drink (counter fills on all soda, so no self serve, but I did notice they do free refills if you go back to counter) were all on the small side.  Burger tasted good, no real complaints, but I don't think it was anything out of the ordinary. The cheese sauce on the fries at least had a good flavor, but it would have been nice if the sauce had covered all the fries. Fries are frozen crinkle cut, and while they were done good, crispy, they're frozen. I figured a place like this would be doing fresh cut. Soda cup was about 3-4 good swigs. I can appreciate the free refills, but wow, get bigger cups already. Like drinking out of a glorified dixie cup.  I dunno, almost $14 for the meal. I realize it's Vegas, and it's the strip, but it wasn't good enough I would consider coming back in next trip. Is this what New Yorker's consider a cult worthy hamburger joint?",

On a positive note, our wait was only 10 minutes compared to the 60 minute wait in West LA.   The verdict: Fries were good, but don't hold a candle to the In-N-Out well done fries. The meat in the burger was awesome and the bacon on mine was BAZANGA (meaning it wasn't some flimsy piece of micro-bacon but a crispy slice of thick cut deliciousness).  Overall: Good place, but this is the one and only time I will go out of my way for it. Where I live, there is no need. Within a mile of where I live, there is an In-N-Out, 2 Habits and a 5 Guys being built.   Best of Luck to you Shake Shack! May I suggest Muncie, Indiana for your next venture?",

    "text": "This place is amazing! My first time visiting Shake Shack was in Las Vegas. I had heard about this small chain but never tried it because there aren't any locations in my home state. Luckily this brand is gradually expanding and openly welcomes customer feedback (suggestions, praise, complaints). During the course of my 3 day vacation I dined here twice. They are open later on weekends so that was very convenient since we don't always eat at typical meal times when in Vegas.  Per my sister's recommendation, I tried the shake stack which is a traditional burger with a unique addition. Nestled in the middle of my burger was a fried portobello mushroom with gooey cheese that oozed out when bitten. If you aren't a fan of mushrooms you can order a regular burger, and if you're a vegetarian they have a burger with all of that minus the beef patty.  Word of caution, be sure to wait before taking a bite! Everything is made fresh from the moment you place your order. If you're an avid fan of fried food then you're all too familiar with the sensation of hot oil burning the roof of your mouth. The portobello mushroom is no different! Not only is the crispy crust emitting heat, but the mushroom and cheese inside are piping hot too. I wasn't given this warning before my first big chomp and quickly regretted my impatient stomach's desire to eat right away. This may not be a tactic that everyone would agree with, but my second time around I pressed down on my burger to squish the mushroom center enough to burst the crispy outer crust. Yes, cheese came oozing out immediately, but it allowed my food to cool down faster so that I could eat sooner :)  If you're ever in the Las Vegas area do your stomach and palate a favor and eat at Shake Shack! Here is a useful or maybe not useful list of all the lucky states/state capital that have been blessed with SS locations (Maryland, New York, Texas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and DC)  Until my next trip, I will be impatiently waiting for them to takeover in California :/",

Talk about some good timing. It was a little more challenging finding a place to sit but we managed to snag a table in under 5 minutes. Person who served me was super cool and super nice, even when I handed him the wrong amount of money (how embarrassing). I have to say the service here is pretty amazing considering it being just a fast food joint.   The menu is huge and clean; you can see it once you walk in. I'm a pretty simple person so I opted to get the Shack burger, which is the basic cheeseburger. The burger was pretty good, but I was a bit underwhelmed while eating it. There wasn't anything special about the patty but it was definitely cooked well. What won me over were the cheese fries. I love cheese and I love potatoes. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle-cut fries but holy cow, every ridge of their fries were crunchy and the cheese oozed over it made it 100 times better! Also got a vanilla shake which was delicious.  Overall, I'd come back again but I definitely prefer in-n-out more.",

Atmosphere: The place was really over the top with lights and what night considering it was vegas. However, the seating was great inside and out. The outside seating had misters which was great for the heat. Inside where mostly booths which were comfortable.   Service: The folks at the register were very friendly. Which is saying a lot because it was packed. They were moving the line rather quickly and we didnt have to wait long at all.  Food: It took about 10 minutes to get our food. We ordered the Double smoke shack, a single cheeseburger, and two single shake burgers. We got three orders of fries and a strawberry shake, chocolate and peanut butter shake to top it off. The burgers had the special shake seasoning which gave the burgers a wonderful charbroil. The burgers were perfect bun to meat ratio and lived up to the hype. The fries was fantastic. The shakes were thick and rich with flavor.  I would definitely go back when in Vegas.",

I figure I'd try the place out.  I ordered one burger with fries and an ice cream cup.  The bill came to $18.  For that price, I could have gotten three double doubles at In n Out and had a GREAT meal.  Their burger is about the size of an item on the McDonald's dollar menu with a little bit of extra secret sauce.  The ice cream was horrible.  I must have ordered the wrong thing because I could have gotten that cup for $1 at McDonald's and add in some dark chocolate chips.  My friend who really enjoys food, didn't think it was great either.  None of us will return to that place as the food and desserts are way overpriced.",

    "text": "Shake stack: think of a double cheese burger, but instead of 2 patties, it's one patty and one mushroom, and 2 different cheese (just refer to the menu for specific ingredients). The price for any double-patty is about $9-10. My boyfriend said a single is pretty small and won't fill me up, so I got the shake stack. I honestly don't think the beef patty was all that special in terms of taste. Yeah, the quality of beef may be fresh, but meh.  -The mushroom was good! Nice little crunch from the breading, and it goes well with the cheese that's melted inside the mushroom. I would probably suggest getting the mushroom on its own, instead of a shake stack. The mushroom patty sort of loses its shine when eaten with the beef.  -Most memorable part of the burger was the sauce. It's just right, not too heavy like innout's thousand island spread. Maybe cause it's more of an aioli.  -Lastly, I love the buns on these, because they're so soft. It's a personal preference. I'm not sure what it is, but it reminds me of potato buns/bread.  Shake: I got the shake of the week: mudpie. 2/5 stars. I don't like chocolate all that much, but I LOVE mudpie ice cream. Sadly, it tasted nothing like it. It was very sweet, and completely lacked coffee flavor. This (expensive) shake tasted like a milk-chocolate milkshake-reminded me a lot of Nestle milk chocolate, but in a thick milkshake form! Was it bad? No, it's just not what a mudpie is suppose to taste like.   Overall Thoughts:  -If youre in Vegas and want a good burger, I suggest spending an extra 5 bucks (14-15$) at Gordan Ramey's \"BURGR\" in Planet Hollywood. Yes, it's a little more expensive, but it's also bigger. But more importantly, you definitely taste the difference in flavor and quality of the patty!! -Many people compare this to innout and I don't think you can really compare the two. But if I had to choose with pricing excluded, strictly cheeseburger to cheeseburger, I'd pick innout. The seasoning on innout's patty is just so darn good and more complex. I feel like a shake shack burger can be emulated with some quality ground beef and some fresh cracked salt and pepper for the natural beef taste. It's good, but not exciting.",

I first heard of it online seeing celebrities posting mouth watering pictures on Instagram(: I'm not a big fan of In N Out although I've lived here 12 years so I can easily say this burger was better than In N Out in my opinion.  It's located right next to Tom's Urban which is a lot more helpful to follow than saying Starbuck's.  I don't think the location is great for locals- I live on Las Vegas Blvd, but not quite on the strip so I think that would stop me from coming here often.  Also, although the burger and shake were tasty (fries nothing special...5 Guys fries are better) I think this place is pricey.  I came with a friend and we both got shakes, burgers and one order of fries and it came to $26.  If they get one off the strip I may still go again- definitely not disappointing.",

Even though the line was to the outside it didn't feel too long. Especially once we ordered our food came out within five minutes.   Burger was very good. A little heavy in the flavor for me, but that could be because I was a bit full from all the drinking. Bread was soft and it tasted very cheesy (loved that). But seriously, kind of like a minor heart attack in the shape of a burger.   Fries: omg so delicious. Just the right balance of soft on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside.   The 50/50 drink is like half lemonade half tea. I figured with a burger I wouldn't want something too heavy to follow it. Really light, a bit sweet and totally good. Also free refills! But you have to go up to the counter to ask for refills   Location has indoor and outdoor seating. Big screen tvs to watch.",

    "text": "Shake Shack has been hailed as the east coast answer to In 'n Out. Given that both offer burgers that are about the same size with thin patties, and both compete as higher quality alternatives, against the mega burger chains in the fast food world, I'd say that's a pretty good claim.   So, let's pretend that the In 'n Out Double Double, and the Double Shake Shack burger are the same price. The In 'n Out Double Double is the better burger, but not by much. The Shake Shack Double is as fresh, and is cooked correctly to order with consistency. One thing I really liked were the cherry peppers. Every burger needs a distinctive touch, and the cherry peppers are that distinctive touch for Shake Shack. In 'n Out wins because their beef is tastier, and the beef should be the star of the burger, right? In addition, In 'n Out fries are better too (not that In 'n Out makes great fries, I just think krinkle fries suck), and so is the lemonade. Speed and quality of service is better at In 'n Out as well, but Shake Shack's speed and service was good. Probably not fair to compare, as Shake Shack is working with a much larger menu. Where Shake Shack really shines is in their menu variety. They have much more to offer than In 'n Out in every facet from burgers to drinks and desserts. Their menu is definitely more creative as well. Fortunately, I got to sample several items, as I was with a large party, and everything was good.  So, let's come out of the pretend world and face the reality that bother burgers are not the same price. The Double Shake Shack burger is $7.00 (at least at the Las Vegas location), while the In 'n Out Double Double is $3.75 (for you east coasters that have yet to try In 'n Out... no I am not kidding!). Sorry, but at $7.00, the Double Shake Shack Burger (and neither is the $6.00 single) is not a standout in the ever evolving world of competitive fast food burgers, and certainly nowhere near the value of In 'n Out's burgers. Simply put, while Shake Shack makes a good burger, In 'n Out offers a better burger at almost half the price. End of debate.  I was tempted to give Shake Shack 4 stars because of it's variety of menu items and over all good quality, but I can't. Why? Well besides the burgers being way overpriced, the fries were just average at best. Burgers and fries are the heart and soul menu items of any burger joint. I just can't see anything more than 3 stars for a burger joint that has okay fries and overpriced burgers. If they they lowered their burger prices by 25% or made great fries like say 5 Guys, then I could see 4 stars.",

Anyways, I recommend getting the Shack Stack burger (if you love cheese and mushrooms)!!! It's a combination of their cheeseburger & their mushroom burger. The best part about this burger is that not only there's a patty inside, but a deep-fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese. IT IS HEAVEN. Take a bite of that & that cheese is oozing on your burger! Bite with caution though because the oozing cheese is hot! I also recommend getting their cheese fries! Their fries are fresh and fried to perfection and it's that perfect melted cheese that tops it off!   Shake Shack, you just gave me a different perspective in burgers now! Thank you lol.",

The same 1/4 pound burger, fries and drink could be had for cheaper at the food court across the street. Speaking of which, the burger, while ok, lacked the flavor of most other high concept burger joints. They also make the mistake of getting cute with their \"Shack Sauce,\" a Frankenstein-ish connoction of ketchup, mustard and mayo mixed together. Granted they had ketchup and mustard stations but why not have that on hand in the kitchen?  And they serve crinkle fries. Really? This isn't an elementary school cafeteria.  And despite their prices this place is too cheap to spring for Coke so you get its dime store cousin, Pepsi.  Sorry. I hear a lot of good things about this place but I'm just not seeing the value.",

    "text": "We Americans are a funny group...don't mess with our country or our burgers! East Coast VS West Coast, gosh how did it come to this? The burger bar is set so high nowadays with each new burger joint trying to out do the other. Enjoying a burger is so subjective, it really is all about what you personally like. Its sort of similar to whether you like your margarita with or without salt, there is no right or wrong answer here people!    I personally am a burger purist and I don't like anything other than the old fashioned Cheeseburger with LTO. Well Shake Shack has officially turned me around. A burger thats topped with a Cheese Stuffed Portobello Mushroom?! WTH?! Just the sound of that makes me cringe but I knew this place came with high accolades so I took a chance and since that fateful day I have never ordered anything but the Shack Stack here. Its juicy, flavorful and it oozes...CHEESE! How fun is oozing cheese you ask? FREAKING FUN! Every bite I was amazed at how enjoyable this burger was and I honestly haven't been this excited for a burger in a long, long time. The saying.. \"Party In My Mouth\" is fitting here. TRY THIS BURGER!  When I first saw the fries I admit I started getting anxious and questioned this decision to walk through NY NY Casino for a burger with Sysco fries. Upon first glance I saw they are the type of fries I was served in school, you know those crinkled and soggy cardboard things the National School Lunch Program passed off as food? Well thankfully they were nothing like the sad sack of fries I was served in high school. These were perfectly and evenly crisped on all sides of the fry. I started chomping away in amazement on how they were able to achieve such an even crisp on all sides of a crinkle cut fry. How did they do it? nom nom...Why has it not been done before? nom nom nom.. This is amazing! I can't believe I'm going to say this... but I like crinkle cut fries now.  We also have enjoyed some of their shakes but my favorite will always be the black and white shake. I think thats where the east coast thing comes in.. I have never had a decent one here in town. Not sure why.. I usually get a puzzled stare when I have ordered one in the past but at Shake Shack I don't have to feel like an weirdo, I fit right in.   Shake Shack is by far the most talked about burger as of late in a city full of burger joints.  And Shake Shack is definitely a place that will stick around. I recommend going there.. Its that good!",

I took a bite of the chicken burger and gave it back to my bf because it was hella dry and greasy. Their shack sauce or what I think is mayo & 1/3 serving of ketchup ain't NADA compared to in & out's. Their fries reminded me of the ore-ida pixie crinkles my uncle use to make when I was younger, again nothing special here. If it was convenient and I wanted a burger I might come back but I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a MUST TRY!",

First I was disappointed at the large notice next to the shakes basically saying they can't guarantee cross contamination of allergens. While I'm grateful for the warning it was a disappointment they can't seem to make cross contamination a priority. Since I'm allergic to peanuts I didn't take the chance so over half their menu was of no use to me.  I had the shack burger and cheese fries. The burger was seasoned with some kind of garlic salt, I didn't care for at all and the size was kind of like a baby burger. The bun was good but other then that, mediocre at best. The fries were...well fries. Nothing special about them or the cheese sauce. In and Out is 10x better. Especially considering we could have had the same meal for half the price.",

Let me clarify, the burgers and fries were good but not of the extraordinarily awesome kind we were expecting. I mean, for the same quality AND much less (half the price), we could have ordered pretty much the same thing at In-N-Out and would have been much more satisfied.   Chick'n Shack ($6.29) - Fried chicken in a bun. The chicken was admittedly fried really well. Seemed to be average in terms of flavor. It is a small burger, though, so you'll definitely need to pair it with something else on the menu.   Cheese Fries ($3.99) - Crinkle-cut fries appear to be their \"thing.\" Fries with a few pumps of nacho cheese. Nothing to write home about.   Our main disappointment is with size, flavor, and price. We don't know what it is about East Coast fast food joints but In-N-Out takes it home any day.",

In my humble opinion, it is better not to judge or favoritize two iconic burger joints that is near and dear to our hearts. Just go and enjoy what they have to offer! Shake shack is a much needed fast food joint on the strip that is reliable, affordable, & tasty! Ordering and getting food doesn't take that long. Their shakes are thick, sweet, & creamy as should be. The holiday favor we tried was the White chocolate mocha. Their burger patties are fresh, if you like cheese, need to order the cheese burger! The soft and sweet bun wraps the savory patty with topping and that first bite off the burger will make you realize why the East coast folks love this burger franchise. Crinkled cut frys comes out hot and crispy and the cheese sauce with bacon bits are so good with those fries!! So if you're a visitor or even a local, brave the traffic down the busy Las Vegas Blvd and get to the shack~ You will enjoy what they have to offer!",

So I can to the shake shack here in Vegas and notice that there was no lines. Why not give it a try. When I looked at the menu the burger slap shot caught my eye because the name was so appealing.  I went up to order my food. The cashiers where super nice and helpful, the food came quick and when I took my first bite the juices of the meat exploded in my mouth. It was good. The meat was so Juicy, but the fried pickle wasn't fried anymore by the time I got my food. So that's for the one less star.   Other then that the food was great!",

It's crazy hectic and loud in here and it can be hard to find a seat.  I'm from Cali so I'm definitely going to compare this to the In N Out burger, which I love! The shack burger is pretty good, but I actually liked the crispy mushroom burger better because it's unique. I really like the crinkle cut fries and you can tell everything is cooked fresh. I do think the employees here can be friendlier, but I guess their jobs are hard and stressful so I can be understanding of that. In N Out wins in my book because it's cheaper and burgers taste better to me. This place is good, but overhyped and not worth dealing with the large crowds.",

The food was good, but nothing really amazing. Everything was hot and presented well, but just okay.   The register staff was a little pushy and rushed us a bit. We'd never been to a Shake Shack before so we needed a few extra minutes.   The restaurant was clean and convenient. The price was decent for Las Vegas and the overall value seemed okay.",

Parking, should you chose to park at the hotel, it's free for the first hour. Not sure how much it is after and for non-hotel residence.  Came in here on a not so busy day, however, the staff that helped us felt like she didn't enjoy her job. With no line behind us, I had to come to her as no one made eye contact with us or even called us to place our order. The first staff I approached kinda just looked away as if she was busy. Then the second staff didn't seemed happy I ended up with her station. No recommendations on what to order. No hi, welcome greeting. Nothing. Not even saying bye after paying.   The burger was okay. It was pretty pink in the middle so I didn't like that. The bread was too soggy for me as the cheese took over the whole burger. Watermelon basil drink was too sweet. We had to water it down so we can drink it. As for the fries, we ordered bacon cheese fries. I think it was not worth it as we couldn't hardly find bacon and had to scrap the plate for some cheese. Definitely lacking bacon and cheese for their bacon cheese fries.",

The meat was well seasoned and I was asked how I wanted it cooked which was great. The burgers are also topped with a special sauce that was very yummy.   The only negative was the cost. A single burger, fries, and a lemonade was over $13. Although I believe in you get what you pay for, I ended thus meal wanting a but more. If you are hungry, I strongly recommend getting a burger with 3 patties.",

The line can sometimes be super long and take 20+ mins to finally get to a cashier; however, on a Saturday night around 745, we were immediately whisked to the front. I will say the lady took FOREVER to take down my order. Sure, I get it was a LARGE order (ordered for 10 people), but if you're at a busy food & beverage place, you should be able to immediately take orders without me having to repeat myself or say one item per minute.  My only other comment is that the buzzers seem to not work. Mine rang, but I had to wait another 5 minutes before actually getting my food. Another person had hers buzz, but when she went up, it stopped buzzing. Please fix this! You cause a lot of hangry people to be a lot more angry this way.",

My favorite has to be the chicken shack burger (it's better than chick fil A by far) with the loaded fries! Great service and definitely a great experience! Cant wait to come back again.",

There are no places I'm aware of on the West Coast that serve custard, so I was particularly excited to learn their shakes are made with custard. I got the spicy bacon cheeseburger, cheese fries and a peanut butter shake. (You've got to put out of your mind how many calories you're eating when visiting this place.) I was not disappointed with the burger other than the size. My bad. Could have ordered a double patty. I was particularly pleased with the fries, of which I had low expectations going in--I've NEVER been a fan of crinkle cut fries (though I've only had the Oreda version made in your oven). The fries were perfectly crispy and salted. You really can't go wrong with cheese fries, can you? I would definitely go again and probably order another patty. Don't fret over the size of the patty; it's fine. I just happen to think all burgers should come at the half-pound size. Neither of my coworkers who I dragged along had even heard of Shake Shack before (for real!). I asked my West Coast coworker which is better: Shake Shack versus In-N-Out. Shake Shack won.",

Double bacon cheesy fries were \"MMM\"! Even had chicken burger and it was so good! The chicken had a very nice crispiness and very moist but not overly oily!   I like how they have cups for water or their house lemonades.   Long lines but goes by fast and good service, location was also easy to find and in a good area.

I didn't love that there was no menu to reference once you got to the actual register. Set up of the dining area didn't really make sense to me either. There was no clear walkway from between all the stations and tables.  The lady at the register was absolutely lovely. She was helpful and friendly, but I don't know how to say that without making you think of a naive minimum wage high school-er who hasn't had her enthusiastic spirit crushed by customer service yet. This lady was genuinely friendly. Extra star for her.  As for the food itself, I tried the spicy chicken sandwich, the shackburger, the fries, and the strawberry mint lemonade. I loved my spicy chicken sandwich. I think it's way better than the burger. It was actually seasoned and flavored. The burger relied on the shack sauce to save it, but the meat itself was plain. I'm not too big a fan of the buns used, but I did appreciate how it was cut so that the sandwiches kept their form. The fries are just fries, nothing wrong with them. The strawberry mint lemonade was actually too minty for me, but I just mixed in regular lemonade and it was delicious.   I would definitely be down to get the chicken sandwich again.",

    "text": "Finally got to try Shack Shake as it has come to my understanding that this is the In-n-Out equivalent over on the east coast!   Parking: Park at New York New York. Free the first hour! They don't do validation here, so if you don't want to pay extra, order fast and eat fast!   Access: You actually don't get access to Shake Shack from inside New York New York. You actually have to walk through the hotel and onto the strip. The entrance is very easy to locate, the giant Shake Shack sign is a dead giveaway.  Line: Due to the ongoing hype, the line is pretty long. It wraps around inside, but they have huge menus for you to look at while waiting to order your food. The wait was probably 10-15 minutes.  Seating: Plenty of seating available. My friends spotted a table right away, it's a little dirty but it's a fast food restaurant. We cleaned it up ourselves anyway.  Food: I got the single patty cheeseburger with a side of crinkle cut fries. The cheeseburger was really good. Patty was cooked medium, so it was very juicy. It was a good size too, I wasn't overly stuffed when I was done with my burger. The fries were extremely amazing. Deep fried, crispy, and not soggy! I usually don't like large crinkle cute fries, but these fries totally made me change my mind!   Overall, Shack Shake is somewhat comparable to In-n-Out. However, I still love In-n-Out because it's a lot cheaper and still just as good!",

    "text": "No one wants me to compare Shake Shack to In-N-Out but....I couldn't help it :(  Shake Shack burgers were really adorable and small and squishable. Visually very pleasing and clean, with bright yellow American cheese, dark green lettuce instead of icebergs, contrasting red tomatoes, and juicy thick patty instead of an extremely pounded-thin one. However, the Shake Shack burger really doesn't hold well - I feel like after a few bites into it, everything just melts with the squishy bun. The cheese is gooey - the gooeyness is great with the crisp crinkle fries, but in the burger, it sogs up the thin single leaf of lettuce that is inside. So at the end of it, I did not feel great haha. Maybe a Coke or a beer could help wash away the heaviness.   But the service is great, the interior here is very clean and in a great location. I still prefer In-n-Out because of the fresh onions and chili peppers and thicker leaves of lettuce that make me feel less heavy than Shake Shack, but I'd probably still go to Shake Shack for the gooey cheese fries haha.",

Sometimes, you can't handle another thing in your stomach and don't want to waste. This time, I also order the hot dog. In general, it was like a Chicago dog. I wish the bun was a bit more toasty because it just melted on the dog making it more like a corn dog. I like spice, so I'll ask for more peppers. It was on the light side.   Service is always quick and management makes efforts to keep. The place clean despite the heavy traffic.  Tip: Beware if over ordering.

There was a line when we arrived but it didn't take long to get to the front. My boyfriend ordered the double shack burger and I had the single shack burger. We also ordered three sides of crinkle cut fries. They give you a buzzer that lets you know when your food is ready. Every table was taken but we were able to snatch one that was really messy. No wonder it was open, no one else wanted it but one of the workers immediately came over to clean it which we really appreciated.  The food was delicious, just as I remembered it in LA. I think a lot of people tend to compare this place to In n Out. I've thought about it but I think they're both good in their own way and I'd continue to eat at both. In n Out is not as greasy IMO but Shake Shack just might be a tad more flavorful. I can't wait to go back to Shake Shack!",

I've only been here twice and honestly both times, I felt like complete crap and wanted to throw up and pass out while in line (TMI, sorry) but even through the worst times of my life, I have to go to Shake Shack for some cheese fries and shake stack burger because I know I'll feel better after.   I don't usually like crinkle-cut fries but the cheese fries are just soooo good and perfectly crispy. The shake stack burger is my favorite because of the fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese that literally drips out after you bite into it. Talk about cheese porn! Never had anything like it, and I fell in love. It's roughly $10 for a burger and they're actually pretty darn small, but I'm not trying to eat a huge meal while hungover anyway so it's always the perfect size for me. I don't know what it is about Shake Shack, but it literally revives me. We went in feeling like sh**, came out feeling brand new. Shake Shack has become a regular Sunday lunch place whenever I visit Vegas. Can't wait to be back!",

The burger was smaller here and to me didn't have the better taste.  Also pretty pricey for what you get.  Small bacon burger was $7.99.  Add on the small shake and fries and total was just under $17.  The only thing better here than In and Out was the fries.  Don't think I'd come back for a burger but may for one of their shakes.",

For whatever reason, they forgot to put in order. Our buzzer went off and  the only item that came out were the cheese fries. I told the girl working there that we order $60 worth of food. She was confused because she never the saw the order. I had to go back to our table and give her a copy of our receipt. So that was annoying because we had to wait even longer.   Everything is a la carte! This place is expensive for a fast food joint. I highly recommend the cheese fries and the chickn shack burger! Not sure if I'd come back though.",

I always get the Portabella Mushroom burger with cheese fries. Their cheese fries are amazing!! The food tasted great and fresh!",

A quick scan through Yelp found that a lot of people ordered the shack stack burger ($9.95) which is a burger with a shroom burger (like a fried mushroom with melted cheese).  I thought it was pretty good; the gooey-ness of the cheese was really good in the burger and the mushroom had a nice unique taste. The fries were... meh. I've never been a fan of crinkle cut fries and they weren't the crispiest either.  Overall it was kind of just an expensive burger that's not that big. At first try I would prefer In N Out but there is a Shake Shack opening close to me soon so I might have to give it another couple tries before I really say I like one over the other.",

I thought I should try it one more time before I left and when I was sober. And, hate to tell you, but it was just as damn good!

I was pleasantly surprised they also served Stumptown cold brew! Their desserts are also quite excellent. I've had the custard in the past.   Pretty efficient service - you wait in line, order food, they give you a buzzer that'll vibrate when your food is ready and you pick it up at the counter! Lots of space to eat. They also have misters outside so you can also eat out there. Can't wait to come back :)",

    "text": "I love burgers. Who doesn't? Us Americans are proud of this American staple and rightly so. According to the statistics, Americans eat 3 burgers a week, that's a total of 50 billion burgers a year. That's right, fifty billion.   Why are Americans so obsessed with a hamburger patty between two buns? Well, you don't have to go far to figure this out. Just read through the reviews on yelp or articles naming the 10 best burger places. The single common denominator is there is no one reason, everyone has their own opinion as to why or how they prefer their burger.   As for me, I've had my share of burgers. I may not eat the average 3 burgers a week, but I know what I like, similar to the billions of burger consumers out there in this world.   Which brings me to Shake Shack. Since this New York burger joint has gone public, there has been a lot more buzz surrounding it's burgers. They serve more than just burgers, such as hot dogs, but their core business is burgers. They also have some pretty good shakes I hear made with custard ice cream.   Their only location on the west is Las Vegas, but I hear they plan to expand into the LA market in 2016. Fortunately, I happen to be in Vegas for my brother's wedding and took the opportunity to see if this was a burger I would be willing to add to my burger diet.   First thing I noticed when I walked into the Shack was how many offerings they had on the menu. In addition to their burger options, there was a section for shakes and custard ice cream, as well as alcohol which included beer and wine.   I wasn't interested in the other distractions, I was focused on their burgers. I ordered the double with cheese. This comes with two decent size patties, tomato, one leaf of lettuce, soft bun, and their shack sauce. Onions are not included.   The size of the patties caught me off guard. They were bigger than I expected and a bit greasy. The paper for which the burger was wrapped in was soaked in grease. The patties had a nice outer crust. The shack sauce was nowhere to be found. I couldn't tell you whether or not I liked it because the flavor was missing. I did like the soft bun, but would have preferred it toasted. All in all, I thought the burger was okay, but a bit pricey.   The fries were good. I like the wrinkle shape and it the crispiness. They also have a cheese add on option.   I'm not sure if they offer refills on the drinks as there weren't any self serve drink stations.   For burger, fries, and small drink, it costs $14. This definitely isn't something I would eat on a regular basis given it's price point, but something I would eat occasionally.",

I definitely had high hopes but left feeling just okay. :'(   Here we go:  Shack stack - This is a cheese burger with a deep fried portobello mushroom filled with cheese, shack sauce, and your typical lettuce and tomato. It looked so good in pictures and the first bite definitely was glorious but I grew rather tired of it after 3 bites in. This burger was just too hearty and rich for me! Not being dramatic at all, but my heart felt heavy after the few bites. All the cheese was rather overwhelming, even for a burger lover like myself. The shack sauce was definitely too rich...as it tasted like it was just pure mayonnaise. The only reason I finished the burger was because it was $9.49.   Double down fries - These are crinkle cut fries topped with cheese, bacon, and red peppers. I love my fries, do not get me wrong...but these were just meh, nothing to rave about. The portion was pretty generous but the price is still steep for what it is...for ~$9.   Vanilla shake - Sadly, I think this was the highlight of my meal. The consistency was just right: not too thick and definitely not runny. Kept me pretty refreshed in the 103 degree weather this weekend.   I'm glad I got to try this place out, but nothing compares to my beloved In-N-Out.",

    "text": "I was a little hesitant to try out Shake Shack since i've heard many mixed reviews from friends that have previously went. I really can't pass up a place that has been hyped up just to see for myself. This particular Shake Shack is located in New York New York. Although the prices doesn't really justify what you get, everything connected to a Casino is always a little pricier than normal. We arrived at 5:00pm on a Saturday. The line was pretty long but it went by fairly quickly.  Double Shack Burger ($7.99): Double patty with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes and shack sauce. The burger was pretty good (we were also starving after the day club). There was nothing TOO special about it but the flavors were different than others I've tasted.  Crinkle Cut Fries ($2.95): My heart lies with in-n-out fries =( I am not a fan of the thicker cut french fries.  Strawberry Milkshake ($5.25): If there's one thing Shake Shack knows how to do right... it's the strawberry milkshake!! Price is steep but it was an absolutely perfect shake! Right consistency, sweetness level and strawberries. The strawberries didn't taste processed and this was not overly sweet compared to In-n-out! If you don't want a burger, at least grab a milkshake! +1 star itself for this yummy concoction.",

    "text": "I've always heard the hype about this NY staple, but honestly was never that intrigued to try it.  But since it was in Vegas and so was I the opportunity was seized. Really like the design both inside & outside. It's themed and branded throughout. I also was very impressed with the various vendors that were featured inside on the video screens. It shows a commitment to high quality and local vendors.  Now for the burgers. Let's use context. As the East Coast competitor to In & Out I'd say it tastes better. But before all you West Coast people start hating, here's why: the ingredients are better, but it's also more expensive so In & Out is a much better deal. I think you can get a 4x4 and In & Out for the same price as a Double Shack. But also the different kinds of custards and the cheese fries look amazing. So based on value In & Out blows this place away, but sheerly on taste Shack Burger wins. Not only are the patties bigger and have better quality meat, but the buns are softer and compliment the burger better.   Next time I want to get the cheese fries and try a shake. I wouldn't put this place in a gourmet burger category yet, but after tasting it I actually don't think it's a competitor of In & Out.   If you love burgers like I do it's worth a try.",

    "text": "Nope. Not gonna do it. Im gonna have to disagree with a majority of peeps being a fan of these guys with 4 stars. As to all up and coming trends, I usually feel the need to check it out just to satisfy my curiosity.  At first I thought they were actually inside the New York New York Hotel and Casino. Nope. To access them you have to go outside to go inside the restaurant. If you see a line going out the door and down the stairs, don't worry, this is normal for the time being. Im assuming eventually the hype will die down. To my surprise, the line moves pretty fast.  I like how they keep the line moving because they are fully staffed to handle the demand. This goes for cashiers, cooks, and bussers. The only issue I have with the place is that there are not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the lunch and dinner rush. From my observation, about half the time, people that ordered just had it to go because they did not want to hassle waiting for a table to open. If you are not by yourself, have another person scope for a table as soon as you get in line. By the time you order, you should have a table ready to go.   As for the food, I went with the Shack Stack ($9.49), Cheese Fries ($3.95), and a regular drink ($2.75). The Shack Stack was just a basic cheeseburger with a big ass breaded portobella mushroom filled with a some kind of liquid cheese. Pro tip: when you first get it, dont bite into it right away. Let it cool down a bit. Yes, I freakin burned my lips and tongue on the damn thing but it was pretty good though. The Cheese Fries were just that. Crinkle cut fries with a melted velveeta type cheese on it. As for the drink, THERE'S NO REFILLS!   In closing, spending 20 bucks for a basic cheeseburger meal with cheese fries and a drink is a bit much. Heck even 10 bucks might be overdoing it. I get it. Prices are jacked up because its located on the strip. It's good. Just not 20 bucks good. Its just ok. I finished my meal and it was just right. So you're telling me I gotta shell out 80 bucks for a family of 4 from a supposedly fast food joint? No thanks. This visit was my first. Might be my last.  Yelp 2015 review #13 512 overall",

    "text": "Justin Y: In-N-Out is the undisputed champion of Burgers, F*ck Shake Shack. Charton C: F*ck you, I tried Shake Shack once it's much better than In-N-Out, my favorite burger ever.  A lot of HYPE about this burger. The Shake Shack vs In-N-Out dispute went on for months and months, my head started to hurt. I was under a lot of pressure to try it by these two in my recent trip to Vegas.  (you may be laughing right now, but too bad i'm serious)  Overall, I think In-N-Out makes a better burger Shake Shack has crazy toppings to bring out more flavors and textures  In-N-Out just tastes fresh, it's TOTALLY California style with the fresh veggies and slim patties At Shake Shack, the \"Shake Stack\" with the cheese-filled mushroom patty is so friggen amazingly good. I would eat the muenster cheese-oozing mushroom by itself.  In-N-Out double double with all my preferred fixings is $3.45 My Shake \"Stack\" was $9.49  In-N-Out has chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry milkshakes (simple.) Shake Shack has frozen custard (heavenly), also tried the black & white, coffee (STRONG, they use Stumptown coffee).  At In-N-Out, potatoes are cut in front of your face, straight into the fryer.  Shake Shack has crinkled fries (\"no preservatives\" but I'm guessing once frozen)  So in the end, it's really a fight between East vs West.  It's hard to compare the two because it's a great simple burger vs an ok burger with great toppings.  All I can say is, get the Shake Stack instead of a regular burger.. that mushroom with the muenster cheese ooze was the best part of my Shake Shack experience",

    "text": "Democrat vs. Republican. East Coast vs. West Coast Hip Hop. Larry Bird vs. Magic Johnson. Connie Francis vs. Lesley Gore. Only one side can ever be chosen among these eternal rivals--you can like and respect both, maybe even listen to or agree with the other. But you know you've chosen a side from birth, and you will forever be linked in fraternity with your chosen grouping. Thus, on my recent visit to Vegas I was thrust into the most important debate of our times: Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out.  Living in Hawaii, I do not have the luxury to regularly patronize the establishments of In-N-Out or Shake Shack. When I would visit California or Vegas in years past, it became a family tradition that the first (or one of the first) places we would eat is In-N-Out. This is due to our mutual love of their fresh vegetables and toasty buns. But when I learned we would have the opportunity to try the Empire State's favorite franchise, well, I started spreading the news to all comers and goers.  Now, unfortunately for Shake Shack there were a few intangibles that colored our experience here. One: It was about 1am having just strolled on down from the T-Mobile Arena and the #iHeartFestival and we were tired and bodies aching. Two: We were both (me at the time especially), sick with really bad throat and head colds. Three: It's dry as hell in the desert for Hawaii kids used to being moisturized by our fragrant air. So take this all with a grain of gray salt.  Being my first time, I was in full-on EYES greater than STOMACH mode and ordered The Stack Shack (a damn fried cheesy mushroom!), Shackburger with onions (to compare with In-N-Out), Chicken Stack (because we fell for its photogenic tuchus), Cheese Fries, Regular Fries, Lemonade, a 32oz Shacktoberfest beer (because I'm a sucker for a souvenir mug), a Jackpot concrete and a beer float. WHOA ALEX, did you win big at the Blackjack table? That's what my credit card asked me at any rate.  The verdict? Well, The Stack Shack is delicious. I mean, you make a mushroom patty filled with cheese, you're going to get at least my mouth's attention with that. In the head-to-head, the patty is thicker for Shake Shack, but I didn't necessarily get that out-of-body nirvana I got the first time I tried In-N-Out as a young, impressionable collegiate man. That could've been the drugs, but I'm pretty sure it was the burger. I'm sorry Chicken Stack--I don't usually prefer chicken to beef and in this case I still don't. It was okay, but nothing special. Fries were good, but I still give the nod to In-N-Out's shoestring fries. The Jackpot was damn delicious, though. It's too bad by that point we were so full, Shacksauce was leaking out of my left nostril.   The atmosphere is very nice at this location. We chose to sat outside and it was nice to quietly eat amongst the din of Strip rabblerousers under the romantic glow of neon signs.   Overall, Shake Shack is definitely delicious and I feel like I know what to order the next time around (definitely get a Stack Shack and a concrete). Is it better than In-N-Out? I'm not sure I can make that decision at this point in time, but I will defer that opinion to my wallet: \"In-N-Out! In-N-Out!\"",

    "text": "So my friends have been raving about Shake Shack even before our trip started.  My closest buddies were planning to have lunch there, and my game plan was to meet them at this specific restaurant--which initially made me think, this place must be the bomb.   We all came here for lunch on Saturday afternoon after a night of crazy shenanigans.  Located right on the Strip, part of the NY NY property, there was no line--very lucky and surprised for a Saturday afternoon.  We placed our orders, and waited for a good ten minutes (much shorter than what I thought since it was crazy busy inside).  I will say that getting a table here is quite difficult because of the massive crowds, however people do get up and leave and that's the time to grab any table, essentially, when dining with 9 other people.    The burgers are to die for, in my opinion.  Sure, it's not a $20 burger, but for the price, this beats In N Out.  The fries are so-so, but hey, the most important item on the menu is the burger right?  The volume is quite thick, and one can easily get full of the one burger.    I must say that it was so fulfilling, and it was actually a nice place to eat.  It's got a young crowd to it.    So the most important question, as maybe some of you yelpers always find from my reviews....would I come back here again?  Yes, most definitely.  My overall grade?  A+",

    "text": "The hype is real. I wanted to like this place, I really did. Burgers are my all time favorite food, so it's extremely disappointing when it's not what it's made out to be. My girlfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday around 12:30 or so. It was quite busy but the lines were moving fast. We were able to snag a table before a flash flood of people came in.   The pager I was given for the food buzzed about 10 minutes after I ordered. I thought to myself \"Wow! This place has already impressed me\" Nope, I was wrong. I hand the person behind the counter my pager and she dumps it into a basket with a bunch of other ones. She proceeds to talk to a co-worker, when she finally turns back around she stared at me with a blank face as if I didn't just hand her my transponder. She asked if she could help me, and I'm stunned. I couldn't believe she did all that mindlessly. She takes my receipt and locates my beer and said the food will come out shortly.  15 minutes have gone by since my pager first buzzed and I'm getting quite impatient. I'm standing at the pick up counter at this point and she finally acknowledges my presence. She says \"You've been standing here for a while, what did you need?\" I tell her I'm still waiting for my food and she asks for the receipt. I tell her she took the receipt the first time and crumbled it after I got my beer. She then goes on the accuse me of lying and saying that the receipt was only for the beer. Ridiculous!!! I wish they had name tags, Jesus Christ. I recite my order and she turns around and like magic, my order appeared.   At this point I'm fuming and don't really have an appetite. But I paid $40 and damn well need to eat it now. I ordered the Smoke Shack for me, Stack Shack for my girlfriend and the Double down fries. The burger is mediocre at best. And the double down fries are pretty plain. Just has nacho cheese drizzled over it with small chunks of bacon on it. The ShackMeister beer also sucks.   It might just be that I came on an off day, but from what I experienced, it's all hype. Don't believe it. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for a burger.",

I'm sure I was destined for disappointment because of all the hype surrounding this place. My friends from NY are constantly raving about Shake Shack and the fated In N Out v. Shack Shake debate has been ongoing with people arguing for both sides.   This particular location is a Vegas hotspot, so there's almost always a line and finding a seat for a big group isn't easy. I got the Smoke Shake (cheeseburger with bacon and cherry peppers) and cheese fries. My experience was already going off to a bad start before even ordering because I didn't anticipate the prices here would be so hefty. My burger was about $7 and the fries are $3-4 (I forget). Once I got my food, I noticed the portion size...like, these burgers are pretty dang small. I also was expecting a bigger volume of fries, but I appreciated that they weren't drenched in cheese.   It wasn't all bad though: for the size, the burger was super filling. It's a pretty heavy meal, which can be good or bad depending on what you're into. The meat was flavorful and the cherry peppers were a GREAT addition to the bacon and meat (they weren't that spicy though, which was disappointing). And while I'm not usually a fan of crinkle-cut fries, I did enjoy the crunch factor of the fries and the flavor of the cheese.   Verdict: In N Out takes the cake for sure. It's cheaper, tastes fresher, and is faster. I think my friends all agreed as well. But Shake Shack wouldn't have such a loyal East Coast following if at least some people didn't find it amazing, so I'd recommend giving it a try at least once to gauge for yourself.  Also, free refills for soda!",

I decided on the SmokeStack (double burger with bacon, cheese and peppers), crinkly fries and a \"blueberry pie, oh my\" frozen custard.   The burger was great! It was spicy and the meat was juicy and messy. The fries were good. And that blueberry pie custard was friggin amazing. I was impressed with this spot.   Better than In n Out!

    "text": "Having now eaten at the Vegas outpost of the famous Shake Shack, I have to wonder:  why?  Why do people wait hours for this in NYC?  Maybe it tastes different there, I don't know.  I hope it does.  But, if I waited 4 hours for the burger and fries I ate at this location, I would be furious at both the situation and myself for allowing it to happen.  First of all, Shake Shack is \"inside\" NYNY, and I put inside in quotations because there is no way to access it from the casino.  You have to walk outside to get in.  This is incredibly annoying, and I can't remember another restaurant with a set up like this.  I could certainly be wrong, they may exist, but I've not seen it on the Strip.  We ate at Shake Shack at around noon on Thursday of the Pacquiao/Mayweather fight weekend.  There wasn't much of a line, although after we ordered it took a long time to get our food.  Far too long given how many people were working back there.  So long that I don't know that I would call Shake Shack \"fast food.\"  I went with the double smokestack and cheese fries, but I was told they didn't have the cheese sauce.  So, second annoyance.    When my food arrived, it was hot.  It had clearly been made fresh, which is good given how long it took.  The fries are crinkle cut, they were just the right amount of crispy and seasoned very well.  Most places just give you naked fries and leave the seasoning to you, so I've got to give it up to Shake Shack for seasoning properly.  The fries are good, but that's it.  Not earth shattering, not mind blowing, not revolutionary.  They're good.  I prefer thinner fries, so I like In N Out's better.  But, these were crispy and tasty.  The burger was a bit of a mess, it was difficult to eat without it falling apart.  The veggies were fresh; I particularly liked the pickles.  The meat is cooked all the way through but retained some juiciness.  It had a couple of crispy edges, which are my favorite.  But, not too many.  I would like it the patties were a little thinner.  The sauce was good, it's mayo based with a bit of a tang to it.  Tasted a little like dijon mustard to me, but only a little.  It's not like other fast food special sauces, which is a good thing.  My bacon needed to be cooked longer, it had virtually no crisp to it.  Again, I prefer In N Out.  The place is clean and employees are constantly asking if you need help, so that was appreciated.  Overall, glad I ate here.  Maybe it's me, maybe I am just missing something.  But, I don't see this as being worth a multi-hour wait, and for $13.50, it wasn't cheap either.  I'd eat at this location again, but only if I was near there and didn't have other plans.  I won't seek it out.",

Here in Houston, we still do not yet have a our first Shake Shack, so we still crave it how we used to chase down In N Out.  I always get the mushroom with their cheeseburger, it's the only way to go.  I actually got their cookies and cream shake and was disappointed.  Hopdoddy reigns supreme for that.

    "text": "Still not too sure why everyone keeps comparing Shake Shack to In n Out... to me, they're nothing alike.  Price: Shake Shack is definitely up there when it comes to fast food joints. Think Fat Burger prices, but maybe not quite as steep. 2 Smokeshacks, 1 cheese fries, and a 16oz Shackmeister ale came out to about $25. Meh.  Burger: The Smokeshacks we ordered came with bacon and cherry peppers. The peppers really added a great deal of flavor and they were a nice touch. I wish the cheese fries had them! The meat had a nice char and was good overall. It's about the same size as an In n Out burger.. but that's where the similarities end for me. The bun was soft and yellow, and looked much like a potato bread bun to me. Good overall, but not sure it's worth the ~$6 price tag.  Cheese fries: Crinkle cut fries tasted like the frozen kind you can fry up at home. The cheese sauce was too salty and just made the whole thing turn into a cheesy mashed potato-like dish. Wasn't too big of a fan and didn't really care for it. The dinky little popsicle stick-ish fork wasn't the most efficient eating utensil either...  Shackmeister ale: Ok so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but since we were here, I wanted to try their house beer! Brewed by Brooklyn Brewing, it popped up on my Untappd as a pale ale... uhhh no. It didn't taste anything like a pale ale, or at least what we're more familiar with on the west coast. It tasted like a light lager. Boyfriend said it reminded him of Dos Equis... Take that as you will. Wouldn't order it again.  The line: It wraps around inside, but when we got here around 3pm on a Friday, it reached just to the front door. The wait was about 15 minutes or so to the front counter where we placed our order. The wait for food was maybe another 10 minutes.  The service: They mess up orders here. A lot. The table behind us had their orders messed up from what we overheard, and they messed our order up as well. I had originally ordered the 32oz Shackmeister ale to share w/ the bf... but the server rang me up for the 16oz one, despite him verbally repeating my order to me and me, again, clarifying with him that I wanted the 32 oz. What'd we get? The 16 oz. (It's okay though--he actually ended up saving us bc the beer wasn't good anyway). And I'm not sure if it was intentional, but they also gave us 2 cheese fries, instead of the 1 we ordered. Were they making up for the other 16oz of beer that they didn't give us? Idk. But it worked to our advantage so whatevers. 2 cheese fries it is. Too bad the fries were too salty and mushy & we didn't even finish them anyway.  ---  TL;DR: Good burgers, soggy/salty cheese fries, expensive and not necessarily worth the wait if the line is long. I wouldn't mind eating here again, however I wouldn't wait in a line that went past the door if I had other options.",

There's something about how the meat is grilled and shaped that is so perfect, like homemade cooking. The buns are unbelievably soft and if I could have a mattress full of dem bunz then I would sleep on it. And the cheese is so yellow and enticing.   I'm gonna stop drooling about the shake burger cause I also had the chick'n shack! It's not a bad sandwich actually! The chicken is really crispy and not overwhelmingly fried or anything. It's complimented with fresh shredded lettuce and pickles.   If everyday were cheat day I would eat shack shake burgers all day.",

Not sure yet, might take another visit. :-P  They were totally packed, and still moved like a well oiled burger machine!  They have it down! We moved through the line quickly, our pager went off, and had food on the table promptly as well. Over all it was quite smooth.  It is loud, and kinda of a scene, if you like that. Has an AWESOME outdoor seating area, that when it is warmer will be THE place to sit and grab a burger, no doubt!  Would happily go back!",

Had the shack stack which was a cheeseburger, with a stuffed portabello mushroom inside, OMG. Amazing.   Had a the chocolate shake with Oreo crumbles also, not bad, but a little too rich for me..

There was a line outside when we got there, but the line moved really fast! Once we ordered the food, the food came out in 10-15min. Their fries go perfectly with their chocolate shake. I ordered a chicken burger as I wasn't in mood for beef burgers, but my friends enjoyed their burgers. The only downside to this place is that there are a lot of people that hogs tables before they get their food, making it hard to find somewhere to eat your meal.",

Everyone else had the original shake shack double burger and loved them. Burgers are very juicy! Cheese fries were nothing special just cheese fries. Milkshakes were pretty basic also.

A group of us came here on a friday afternoon for lunch after driving for about 3 1/2 hours from LA.  The line looked daunting but it actually was not too bad. They have many registers opened and the line went by pretty fast.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the Shack Stack, shared an order of crinkle cut fries, and a large soda.  Total came out to about $30 (OUCH) but it was worth it.  Especially that shack stack burger!!!!! It's even more worth it if you add bacon to it.  But be careful because it can be VERY hot when you bite into that cheese filled mushroom (yummmm).  Fries were crispy and perfect.    I definitely miss Shake Shack now that we've returned to reality.  Hopefully the next time I take a bite of that shake stack burger, it would be at the original location in New York City :)",

The size of the burgers are comparable to an In and Out.   The cheese fries were about what one would expect from cheese on fries. I appreciate that they used the kringle fries. I prefer thicker cut fries. We also had the Concrete which was pretty good, but I think we should of gone with a milkshake instead.

Shake shack burger patties have a great meaty flavor that amplifies them beyond their thin, fast food patty dimensions.  The shack burger is good, but the bacon green chile burger is incredible.  The chiles add a vinegary taste (serving a pickle-like purpose) which is a great balance to the savory meaty patty and creamy sauce.  I hope chiles become the new exciting pickle replacement at more burger joints.",

    "text": "Interestingly, this was my first time experiencing Shake Shack, despite the fact that a location in Orlando had been around for a few months before my trip to Las Vegas. In general, this location is very typical of other eateries along the strip--always busy, loud, and bright. However, we stopped in here twice and they do a very good job of getting the line moving along, even during the lunch rush.   As far as the food is concerned, there are a variety of burgers to choose from including beef, chicken, and veggie burgers. I decided to go with the smoke shack, which is served with cherry peppers and bacon. Crinkle cut fries and a fair trade coffee shake were also ordered to complete the Shake Shack experience. Overall, the burger and fries were delicious, with the burger patty slightly reminiscent of Steak N Shake, but much thicker and meatier with more flavor to it. The crinkle cut fries were also great but in my opinion could have been a little thicker to give them more flavor. The star of the meal was the coffee milkshake which so far has been the only custard style Ice cream I have truly enjoyed. Perhaps the coffee flavor balances out the twang of the custard that I'm not a huge fan of (probably because I didn't really experience this type of ice cream growing up). Regardless, I enjoyed our meal and look forward to trying out the other burger options offered by Shake Shack in the future.",

They have some service issues to work out which is to be expected since it's new (e.g., took 10 minutes to get me a draft bud light, tables weren't getting bussed, etc.). I know there's a huge SS vs In n Out debate and I think SS might have the edge but this place is so hard to get to (parking at NYNY is awful, there's no entrance from the casino, etc.) that for someone not within walking distance, just drive to In n' Out and if you do have a car, this place might not be worth the hassle of parking. Very, very solid 4 stars!",

With that confession out of the way, I must say I can totally understand what the hype about this place is, whereas I couldn't understand why people love In-and-Out so much. (separate review)  Within my 6 day stay in Vegas, I had two meals at Shake Shack. During the first visit, I tried the Shack Attack - It satisfied every craving at 1AM after just getting off the plane. The condiments table was surprisingly clean and organized, there was no mess to be seen as opposed to other fast food chains.   My second visit was a bit underwhelming, which was why I did not rate them a 5 star. This is because I tried their hot dog instead of sticking with the burger. I think I had a better hot dog from a street vendor... but the crinkly fries kept me satisfied!   I hope they expand to Canada one day!",

    "text": "There isn't a shake shack in San Diego at the moment (coming to La Jolla in 17) so I was interested in trying it out while in Vegas. I ordered a double burger and fries. Prices are notably higher than my favorite fast casual Burger joint, the Habit Grill.  To start I was not a fan of the bun. It was soft and mushy. I prefer it being slightly toasted to have a little contrast to the meat and toppings. I also felt the double patty was a little too much meat for the bun that was used. I ate about 4/5th of the burger before I was full. The crinkle cut fries also lacked seasoning for me.   Out of the three of us that ate, one friend liked his burger but none of us need to eat here again. They also orderd the cheese fries but it was severly lacking on the cheese sauce. One of them ordered a burger, cheese fries and shake and the total was $18 after tax.",

Everyone raves about Shake Shack, particularly my East Coast buds, and being an In n' Out advocate, I was eager to see what the all hubbub was about. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be.   I tried a peanut butter chocolate milkshake (DUH. SHAKE shack), fries, and their special burger Roadside Shack burger. I absolutely adored the shake. You can tell its a legit real ice cream, real peanut butter shake. I was majorly impressed. The fries were crispy and crinkle cut so naturally I loved them. However the actual burger was a huge disappointment. It was overly salty and the caramelized onions were composed of salty goo and a few diced onions. However, when my mouth adjusted to the aggressive amount of salt, I did get to taste the cheddar cheese and it was so good. Very natural, sharp cheddar.   I will definitely go back and try a different burger. Maybe this special won't last long. But be warned, the Roadside Shack is a dud.   The place does have wonderful ambience and its for sure a chill place to sit down and grab a bite on the strip. Doesn't feel like a fast food joint at all.",

Although I've only gone both times around 8pm, there is ALWAYS a line, however, its never a long wait to order. Both times I got the Shack Stake and both times there were amazing. Tried to get the fried mushrooms on the side, but they don't sell it, Sad. I've tried a few of their shakes and wasn't too impressed with them. The strawberry was decent. The same as everywhere else so nothing I'd go out of my way for.  I also tried their salted peanut butter shake and that was just a mistake. So salty. I know its salted, but it was as if someone was mad and decided to get back at the customers by loading up the salt content.   Other than that, the wait time was an average of 10-15 minutes for the food. Service was great. The place is kept clean even though they're so busy. I loved being able to sit outside with all the beautiful lights in the background.",

    "text": "My quest for the best chain burger has been one that's lasted at the very least the five years that I've taken my foodie habit a bit more serious than most, and it's been packed with hidden gems, unwarranted hype, plot twists, and a truly ridiculous amount of time spent on airplanes. However, the past two years or so have seen one champion sit atop the burgery throne, wearing the crown that comes with the title of best burger chain restaurant. Bow down In n' Out, The Habit, Whataburger, Five Guys, and Umami, because Shake Shack, as of 2015, is your king.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Irrespective of the weather, the time of day, or how long you've been in Vegas (too long most likely), Shake Shack on the strip is nothing short of a beautiful oasis. The desserts and shakes in and of themselves are better than anything you can find elsewhere, and the burgers truly are the stuff of legend. Fortunately, these goods will come from the fast, efficient, and friendly hands of a shake shack staff that can burn through a 50 person line faster than nearly anywhere else I've been, and they'll do it with a smile on their faces. Seating? Abundant, and even if things are packed it's likely you'll be able to post up either inside or out. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Shake Shack could, without a doubt, slap double digit Chipotle prices on their board and still make a killing, but even in Vegas, they don't. A single SmokeShack burger? $6.70. A hefty double? Still sub $10. Fries are reasonable, shakes are reasonable - everything is reasonable, and especially since it doesn't have to be, it's a beautiful thing because it's more than likely that you're not exactly here to spend the hoards of gold that you won at the casino. Star Granted.    Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  The burgers at Shake Shack are simple, and it's that simplicity that makes nailing down what makes them so good so frustrating. Is it the fluffy but oddly flavorful bun that so wonderfully absorbs the juices of the patty and cheese? It may well be. But then wait, is it the salty but flavorful perfectly cooked patty itself that pairs so beautifully with the bacon and truly out of this world chopped cherry peppers on the SmokeShack? Is it the simplicity of the fresh lettuce, tomatos, and cheese on the standard cheeseburger that make it such that you could down three without even slowing? I honestly and truly don't know the answer, but the burgers at Shake Shack are good almost beyond description. They're everything I've mentioned and even more given the classic but tasty fries and the exotic but equally classic milkshakes that will have you finding reprieve from the oppressive heat trapped within the strip. Shake Shack is perfect. Perfect. Dual Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Without question or hesitation - Shake Shack deserves all of the love and attention that they're getting, and the Vegas location is no different. This is the best chain burger out there. Star Granted.",

The burger was good and I'm always a fan of melted cheese on anything so them cheese fries were very good.

    "text": "The \"East Coast\" of In N Out... would I agree? Not quite sure if I can compare the two burger joints.  In N Out: 1. Fast, very fast food 2. More fresh ingredients 3. Lighter 4. Super affordable  Shake Shack: 1. Not-so-fast fast food 2. More gourmet 3. Heavier 4. Pricier  Shake Shack is more dine-in whereas In N Out (for me at least) is more of a drive-thru option. Shake Shack has more complex flavors and options, which obviously to some people may \"taste better\" since flavors are elevated. If you're looking for a simple, fresh, and cost-effective burger, then In N Out is for you! If you're looking for a once-a-week treat, go head to Shack Shack.   Both are good, but it all comes down to what kind of burger you're looking for. Shack Shack gives more options - beer, desserts... both delicious.  If you're looking for something unique, try the Shack Stack. Your taste buds will experience the euphoria of melted choose oozing out of the layers of the burger. Worth to pay a visit if you're here (instead of going all the way to NY!)",

One regular shake shack hamburger $6 did not fill me up.  I need to spend approximately $12 to fill me up.  That is pricey for eating hamburger. I also had the strawberry shake but kinda pricey for the amount they gave me.  I prefer the west coast In N Out burgers over the NYC's Shake Shack for the price and amount you get.

This place is very beautiful and modern with outdoor seating and water mists to keep customers cool from the scorching heat. However, my burger was also sweating oil due to the hot weather too. My burger was so greasy that the oil was seeping through the wrapper and onto my hands. I don't think it has that presentation that I was hoping for either. I like to eat with my eyes, so when I saw my burger lopsided as if it was just thrown together with no effort in presentation already made me score this restaurant on the low end of the scale. The fries were extra crispy, which I enjoyed. I also ordered a 50/50 (arnold palmer) and it tasted very diluted. Not so much tea or lemonade, just water. I think next time I'll stick to my cheeseburger and animal style fries.",

I'll take a good In-N-Out or Five Guys burger over Shake Shack any day. The prices at this location are high, probably because it's on the Strip.  I hear they've opened another one in Summerlin - maybe the prices are lower.   So... pros and cons:  + The fries are very good, probably better than In-N-Out, but a notch below Five Guys + Location is cool, great outdoor seating, view of the Strip + Shakes are very, very good  - Shakes are very, very small for the price - No soda refills - Busy and noisy (full of tourists) - Burgers are marginal and a bit small  So, maybe just maybe you should visit Shake Shack to say you've been there.

But only giving this place 3 stars for how tiny the portions are for the high price you pay. I paid more than $10 for a tiny burger with a Portobello mushroom wedged inside. I feel more satisfied and full after a $3-$4 In-N-Out burger, and the food comes out much quicker. Our food came out decently quick, but the cago dog took too long. The shack burger had quite a wait too for the most original thing you can order on the menu. Would I come here again? Sure! Would I come here again if there was an In-N-Out nearby? Probably not.",

I had the vegetarian burger, which was really good, and we shared fries. We were surprised that the burgers were smaller than expected. They definitely have a lot of variety on the menu, and the custard style ice cream (which I sampled) that is also used in the shakes was thick.   For the two of us, both with one beer each, the total came to about $35. It was reasonably priced as far as Vegas is concerned, however it left us a little lacking and there wasn't much \"wow\" factor for somewhere that has been talked up so much in the past. (Perhaps it's the novelty of having a Shake Shack out West that gets most people.) However, the wait staff was very friendly and helpful and we had a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "Is it better than In-N-Out? In some areas, the answer is yes, while other areas, definitely not. First of all, everything at Shake Shack costs more than In-N-Out. Maybe it's comparing apples and oranges?   I tried the Shack Burger, Cheese Fries, and Chocolate Shake. Everything was really good. I'll start with the burger. Meat quality I think is better than In-N-Out, but it lacks sauce (unlike that infamous spread at In-N-Out). I actually added some mustard to bring out some of that meat flavor. Moving onto the cheese fries. Yes, very good especially with that cheese drizzled on top. Can't go wrong, especially if you like the crinkle-style fries. Having said that, the In-N-Out fries are thinner and you can taste the freshness. Again, hard to compare? The shakes at Shake Shack definitely beats the shakes at In-N-Out. First of all, you can actually drink the shakes from the get-go versus having to wait  for some defrost action with the shakes at In-N-Out. My chocolate shake was not overly sweet and cold enough to make a decadent dessert drink. All in all, solid All American burger shop right on the LV strip. Plus, they have decent selection of draft beers. Must try Yelpers!",

The Smoke Shack, in particular, with cheese, bacon, cherry peppers and Shack sauce, is great. The Chicken Shack is really good too, as are the hot dogs and cheese fries.  The Jackpot concrete, with crispy Belgian waffles, strawberry goo and sprinkles, is worth blowing your diet. Like you didn't already with the burgers and cheese fries.",

When we got to ordering our food, I didn't know which beer I wanted, so the cashier allowed me to taste the different kinds and make a good decision.  He also thought we might have ordered a lot of food, so he informed us of that, which was nice, I could see people ordering too much food and getting upset that they don't finish it, but that was a normal order for me. For my meal, I got the shake burger, with loaded fries, and the scrimshaw to wash it down with.  He burger is decent, rather small, but tasted good.  It's served with a potato bun which makes it different in a way. In no way does it taste better than the double double at in n out though.  The loaded fries on the other hand were really good.  They had chopped up peppers, bacon, and cheese on it.  This is a huge serving, for 2-3 people, but I had it on my own, but didn't finish it.  I wish they could make an individual size for that, because it cost $8.99.  The cashier did warn me about it, so I'm fine with it. This to me is better than the animal fries at in and out.   It's a spot I'll go again for sure, maybe not here in Vegas, but as more spots pop up in Los Angeles, it'll be a good alternative to In n Out, but definitely doesn't beat it in my opinion.",

The lines get quite long here so you need to plan around it and come between lunch and dinner or late night when theres less people. Their burgers, while being on a the smaller side, have so much flavor. They are usually cooked just right (medium) and so they are nice and juicy as you take each bite.   You can't go with with a regular burger, crinkle fries, and a shake. Highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Whenever there's hype around a fast food place... I get skeptical so I was keeping my expectations low on this one.  So we got there around lunchtime and I was pretty hungry because I had skipped breakfast that morning.  I ordered the The Smokeshack which had peppers and bacon some fries and a concrete thing called the Shack Attack.  The burger was ok.  Nothing special.  I read some of the other 5 star reviews and everyone seems to compare it to In N Out so I too will compare it to In N Out.  I personally think the burgers at In N Out are better.  The burger that I got at Shake Shack was very underwhelming.  It was tiny for the price and the patty just wasnt all that.    The fries were fries.  I love the fact that they were crinkle cut fries, but flavor wise, nothing special.  I still think the fries at Mcdonalds is the absolute best and if you think my review is tainted because of that comment, SCREW YOU!  Just kidding =)  Lastly, the concrete thing I ordered.  It was called the Shack Attack and it contained the following:  Chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough and Mast Brothers Shake Shack dark chocolate chunks, topped with chocolate sprinkles'  Sounds good right?  It was ok.  The problem was that it was already melting by the time my buzzer went off.  I was so disappointed with this place that I went to Secret Pizza, ordered 2 slices and inhaled it.  Anyways, totally over-rated in my opinion, but to each their own.",

    "text": "Yayyyy!!!!  The Vegas location is open!!!  Now I can enjoy a favorite east coast burger spot a tad bit closer to home.  If I'm counting correctly, I will be the 113th review...a surprise considering they've already been in business close to 3 weeks.  However, NICE since the line wasn't absurdly long while we were there.  We only waited 15 minutes to order.  I'm sure by the time spring break comes around, that wait time will double, if not triple.    A resident at the New York New York Hotel, Shake Shack sits right along the strip, so you won't miss it.  There is ample seating indoors and outdoors, with tables, communal tables, and there's even a little lounging area...impressive.  Its wide open space allows for several big screen tvs that play sports channels.  The vibe is very hip and casual.    For my second visit at Shake Shack, I decided to try their Shack Stack...a breaded portobello mushroom burger atop a cheeseburger with that delicious bread that they use.  So good!  Of course I got the crinkle cut fries...yummy yum yum!  This time around, I tried dessert.  The shake...took a sip(s) of my hubby's caramel shake...not super sweet, just sweet enough.  I made sure I tried their frozen custard too.  They have weekly specials, along with their regular flavors of vanilla and chocolate.  I opted for the weekly special which was peanut butter banana.  Yes, highly recommended!!!!!!!!  Overall, I was a happy camper!!!!",

I ordered the SmokeShack single without the cherry peppers and an order of the cheese fries with a black and white shake to drink.  The bun on the burger was delicious! It was toasted and warm and the cheese was melted and gooey. The ShackSauce was on the creamy side and had some spice to it. The cheese fries were also yummy, they come with a fork that keeps your hands from getting messy (they are very cheesy cheese fries, just how I like 'em!). The black and white shake was okay, good, but not great. It was a blend of chocolate and vanilla so I would want to get a more specialized flavor the next time.   The line was long when we got there but they were efficient with taking orders and then getting your order out, so don't let that sway you! It was not a bad wait at all.",

I'm in love with their brioche bun which is very soft and moist, and the bun is not cut across all the way so when ur eating the ingredients are not going to fall out the other side, genius! They have a special Shack sauce, which actually kinda tastes like garlic infused mayonnaise. The Shack burger will come with cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce, but if u want to add pickles or onions, they most definitely can. The cheese fries sauce are hot when they are served to you which makes it so much better, it's sort of similar to a nacho cheese.   There are of course tables to sit at but there are also some lounge areas without a table. But I don't see it being a problem since your food is served to you on a metal tray which u can set in ur lap. Service is very friendly. It is located right outside the New York New York hotel right by the Brooklyn Bridge.",

    "text": "Ok- I finally get a chance to review this.   I was trying to find the right words to say because people are going crazy over this. I just needed time to sort out my thoughts so don't kill me but I must be True to myself...  I prefer In and Out over Shake Shack. THERE! I said it! So much has lifted off my shoulders. PHEW!  Now let me explain- it's not a horrible place but if you put a gun to my head- yeah- I said it....I pref in and out. One major thing is the bun.  It feels and taste like a Hawaiian roll.  If you're into that- then this is the place for you.  Me, on the other hand, I like em soft but NOT sweet.  I always get my buns extra toasty at In and Out and this was soft and I could imagine it soggy iN .2 seconds. It was the type of bun that would get in the nooks and crannies of your teeth and you wouldn't even know it but when you turn to your friends or boo, there would be white chewed up bun pieces in the interproximal of 6 or more places.   Fries with crinkled- reminded me of middle school and that's where it's gonna stay. The cheese dried immediately and made all of them stick together. Flavorless.   I'll just drive off the strip and stick to my go to but thanks for the 2nd meal after looking in the mirror :P",

Although more expensive than other fast food burgers, the meat quality, bun softness and overall taste make up for it! I got just a plain hamburger with lettuce, onions, tomatoes and light shack sauce. The line is a little slow as well when receiving the food and with a shake or fries, the prices can be high but it was delicious!",

But for a simple burger like so, it was a bit expensive.   the shake was delicious. i ordered the oatmeal cream pie shake since it was limited time offer and OH MY....i felt like i was eating a cookie but blended in milk. that strong oatmeal cinnamon flavor -- it was SO good.   i enjoyed my oatmeal cream pie shake more than the burger.",

The Shake Stack comes with a beef patty AND a deep fried portobello mushroom that is stuffed with cheese! The breaded crust on the portobello mushroom is like the outer layer of a really good onion ring and gives it a nice crunch before hitting the hot cheesy center. That combined with a charbroiled beef patty, fresh tomatoes, lettuce - added pickles- is absolutely amazing!!!!   Nothing beats the Shake Shack in NYC but it's still very good! Also a plus, the workers here are very nice, patient, and polite.",

    "text": "just SHAKE it!  As this review is LONG OVERDUE, I'll just summarize the main points:  1.  Located at New York, New York.  Shake Shack is actually located outside the hotel/casino.  Look for the various signs and arrows to help you find your way to this indigenous NYC establishment.  I walked over from the Luxor and all the signage was extremely helpful.  2.  Indoor and outdoor seating available.  3.  The menu is pretty straight forward:  Burgers, fries, shakes, and drinks.  I ordered a smoke shack burger, fries (crinkle cut), and a lemonade.  My downfall was not ordering a shake.  I must have been out of my mind honestly for failing to have the product synonymous with its name.  Well, I guess there's always a next time (which I'm sure there will be).  4.  The burger was outstanding!!  I first visited SS on a visit to NYC two years ago, and I will say that the food is as good as I remember it to be.  The burger was juicy and well prepared, while the bacon provided that extra goodness of flavor.  It was so delicious!  The fries were pretty awesome too; good portion and very crispy.    5.  The setting / atmosphere is spacious, airy and fun.  The service is efficient and quick.  The staff that helped me at the order counter was friendly but to the point as to keep the line moving.  Incidentally, the line moved at a very decent pace.  I didn't want to wait too long for my food as I observed that the kitchen operated as a well-conditioned machine; everyone has a specific job and all seemed very capable and productive.  The staff in the indoor dining room kept things neat and tidy.  BOTTOM LINE:  The burgers and fries are awesome!  Its cool and convenient to have this NYC eatery in Vegas.  I'll be back....... for a SHAKE!",

I don't eat meat, so my options were limited to the Portobello Mushroom burger to which I also added cheese fries. The burger was okay, but the mushroom was fried and it was too greasy for me. The cheese fries were served with a container of melted American cheese (to pour over it, I assume).  The nice thing about Shake Shack is that they serve alcohol (or at least at this location).  It was an okay, fast and relatively cheap meal but I prefer In N Out",

But I have now had the full experience and I can say that I am truly a fan!  Hubby and I shared a burger that was topped with bacon and a roasted red pepper sauce that was absolutely bursting with with flavor and juiciness! And while I'm not usually a fan of crinkle fries because they scream frozen and flavorless. But these not only had a decent crunch on the outside, but they also were nicely seasoned.   I chose to get a small custard. Being from the Midwest, I'm no stranger to awesome custard with which to create an amazing concrete. Usually with as many mix-ins as they allow. However, I decided to follow their lead this time and simply pick something from the menu. While it forever for them to prepare (compared to how fast I'm used to) and I did feel like the mix-ins were a bit on the skimpy side, this is some amazing custard! I'm not usually a fan of plain vanilla, but this stuff is extra good! It has a depth of flavor that I simply can't explain. On top of that, it has all the creamy perfection that you crave when it comes to custard. The more I write about this, the more I am convinced that I need to go get some right now, but this time get a large!...",

Do NOT let the pictures deceive you people, the burgers here are on the small side. It took about 15 minutes to get my burger after ordering and only one minute for me to finish it. It was good though don't get me wrong. That portobello mushroom was a perfect touch. But for the price and the wait, I don't think it's really worth it.  The crinkle cut cheese fries were pretty good but they were also on the small side. Their shakes weren't that great. I can't remember which ones I tried, but I went with three other people who all got different shakes and I just remember thinking that these were definitely a waste of calories and money.   Maybe it was just a little overhyped for me before I tried it but I feel like this place is just a solid 3 out of 5 stars in my book. I'll stick to my in-n-out thanks.",

If I paid $17 for food I would expect larger portions.  The shake (the coffee fair shake) was probably the best thing about the meal.  That was a $5 shake.  At least I can say I tried another Vegas eatery, but I would opt for a Gordon Ramsy Burgr by Planet Hollywood if I am gonna pay $17 for a meal.",

I ordered a custom concrete, fries, and a Shack Stack. The fries and Shack Stack were fine - burger was nice and juice, bread soft, cheese gooey, and the fries were nice and crisp. My concrete though? Completely melted and Shake Shack is roughly 2.6 miles from my office. Even if my driver was delayed a little bit, it shouldn't melt completely during a 7 minute drive (according to Postmates). On top of that, after it melted, it literally only filled up half the cup. Shouldn't my concrete be the last thing to be made to preserve it's temperature? Well, I guess I'm lucky that they forgot my napkins and utensils. I ended up having to drink my concrete.  To be clear, it wasn't so much the food, but the way my food was brought to me.",

    "text": "Like a few others, I also don't get the hype over Shake Shack considering the west coast has a plethora of restaurants offering delicious burgers at varying price points, flavor, and quality.  I ordered the double hamburger with no bun, as I tend to find the bun takes away from the flavor of a delicious burger. The burger patties were pretty small (see photo) and I requested for extra tomatoes and only received a total of 3 small slices. Their shacksauce wasn't memorable and I ended up excluding it from the burger. Sometimes I think, \"hmm maybe I just didn't order the right thing\", but then I remind myself that if the plain hamburger is lackluster, then they probably shouldn't have it on the menu. The crinkle fries were ordered as well done and were tasty, but I still prefer thin-cut fries (especially shoestring!). I skipped on their shakes as I didn't deem them worth of the extra calories, and my friends didn't either after consuming them.  Overall the employees are friendly and there's plenty of seating indoors as well as on the patio area. The line appears long, but it moves fairly quickly and the actual turnaround time of your meal is less than you'd expect. I'd still prefer In-n-Out in SoCal or SuperDuper Burgers in SF because their sauce is delicious, their fries crispy and flavorful, and the burger meat stands out.",

Shake shack is more expensive and feels more like a restaurant than fast food.  So here is the comparison:   Shake shack:  -Way better for fries - chicken sandwhich is really good and better than chick filet - more flavors for shakes  In n out - would say the burger is better for the price. I like the thousand island sauce and shake shack does not offer grilled onions - burger bun is not as soggy as shake shack",

After messing up my order, I came back to the counter and she accused me of \"trying to play a game\" on her. She failed to get it correct a second time, I came back and she rolled her eyes at me and said \"Can't you see I'm busy?\" NEVER have I been so disrespected by someone serving me, especially since I make it a point to always treat others the way I'd like to be treated. It's very disappointing to see that this location has an employee like this representing their establishment. Overall, great food. Definitely don't miss it. Hopefully this review will help management take proactive action in improving customer service.",

It was just ok for us--out of the five of us, only two would want to come back.  Personally, I thought the first bite was amazing--especially the fresh bun (was that a Hawaiian roll?).  But three or four bites in, the grease becomes a little much and it gets heavy.  The fries and shakes were also just ok for us--nothing over the top (in our humble opinion).  Nobody panic, we ate every morsel (and then felt guilty because of the grease) and nothing was wasted.    We wouldn't throw them out of bed for eating crackers, but we aren't in a race to go back.  LOL Glad we tried though!",

You order/pay at the counter, given a light thingy, pick up your food at the counter when it's ready..  Service here is great, friendly guys at the counter, and other employees checking on the dining room.   The burgers were delicious!!! I got their cheeseburger (added bacon), and hubby got their shack stack... The patty is so juicy and flavorful. The shack stack is a bit bigger. But my cheeseburger was a medium size, not that small, but not that big either. I was able to kill it. Haha the breaded mushroom on the shack stack is amazing. Great mushroom flavor with a little extra crunch and flavor from the breading.   Yes, I also ordered their version of a Chicago dog to try.. When in Vegas, right?? The flavor was great, but I did have some problems... The bun was too weak to support all the goodness, and it broke as soon as I tried to lift up the hot dog. Had to use a knife and fork... Also, the hot dog itself actually tasted a bit tough. Not buttery or juicy. Sigh!  Their crinkle cut fries were nice and crunchy.  Hubby ordered his fries with cheese, but you could probably do without, bc everything else is so rich and savory (and likely also with cheese), the cheese on the fries actually got overpowered!   They also have frozen custard and shakes. We asked for a \"Neapolitan\", which they were able to make. Nice and creamy. Good flavor.   Prices are alright, not to extreme, it's a more affordable meal on the strip.   Yum!",

Ended my most recent Vegas trip with lunch here - order times were super short, but wait time for food was about 10-15 minutes around 1pm on a Sunday. Not too bad!  I had the 'shroom burger and BF had the shack stack. Both were deeeelicious and we loved the gooey cheese that's baked (fried?) into the mushroom. We also noticed the bun was closed off on one side, so we wondered if that was on purpose to keep the cheese from oozing out the bottom. If so, smart! We also shared an order of cheese fries and a custard. I prefer the fries plain so you can really enjoy the crispness 'cause by the bottom, the fries were too cheesy. Custard was good, but too rich and sweet for me to take more than a couple bites!  Looking forward to making this a regular pit stop on future Vegas trips, and CAN'T WAIT for them to open their LA location in 2016!!",

Came here on a Friday night around 9PM and there was no line. I ordered the Shack Burger, a Chocolate Shake, and Cheese Fries.   (+) Shack Burger: Juicy medium rare beef patty, crisp lettuce and tomato, sweet/soft patty.  (-) Chocolate Shake: Diluted chocolate, tasted mostly like vanilla, melted quickly. (-) Cheese Fries: I could buy frozen Ore-Ida fries and melt a Kraft american cheese slice on top by myself.  They give you a buzzer, which allows you to go find a seat while you wait for your entire order to be ready presented on a metal tray. Indoor seating is limited to smaller parties, while outdoor seating has park tables. I recommend sitting outdoors because hey, when does it ever rain in Vegas? Sitting and admiring the bright lights, tall buildings, and hustle and bustle while eating your burger is the best way to start the night.",

When you park in the NY NY parking garage, it is a pretty long walk, which is the reason for me putting only 4-stars.   Service: It was good. The interactions with the workers are fairly short. The woman who took our order was nice. She was patient with us as we asked many questions about the menu and her opinion on the food. You pick up the food after your buzzer goes off. You grab your own condiments, napkins, drinks, and utensils. The cashiers are the ones grab the beer for you. If you want to stop by only for the custard, I recommend waiting in the short line outside. There is an express window for the custard.   Ambiance: The place is loud. Sometimes you will encounter drunk folks coming here. Just ignore them. It is great for kids since they can be as loud as they want. There is outside seating as well. The set up is organized. The place looks clean. I would have someone grab a table right when you walk in. They get taken up pretty fast!   Food: Delicious. I got the Shack Stack, cheeseburger with the Shroom Burger combined. It is SOOO GOOD! I would never want to eat another burger unless it has the fried portobello mushroom in it. lol We also got the fries, which were meh. They were fries. Nothing epic or special. For dessert, we got the custard with red velvet mix in it. This is very good and I highly recommend it.   Price: Fairly priced. I would say it is around $15 a person.   Drinks: Any alcohol you buy on the strip is overpriced. The soda drinks are decently priced at around $2. That is the average for this area.   Overall, it was a great experience that you recommend for you to experience! But, I must warn you the food is not as good as the Shake Shack in DC or NY and I don't know why.",

My friends and I got here right before peak dinner hour so the line was negligible.   I got the SmokeShack, it was pretty good, idk if I liked the chili peppers? I really liked the bread and how flavorful the patty was. The cheese fries were alright, kinda felt like it tasted like fake cheese (like they put on nachos) but tasted less like \"fake\" cheese.  The restaurant was really clean and well-ventilated! I like the ketchup and mustard dispensers, you don't have to pump it. It's more like a ketchup and mustard faucet. Lol",

The location is larger with much more seating, but the portion sizes were tiny! I ordered the shroom burger for $6.99 and cheese fries for $3.99. The fries were just as good as I remembered but I was so disappointed with the shroom burger. It was more like a snack for me. For $7, I'm expecting more than just a snack of a burger. A bigger dude would probably need 3 of them to feel full. It was fun to eat because they stuff the mushroom with cheese and fry the patty, but I was sad to see the burger done after 3-4 bites. At least the strawberry lemonade for $4 was good (regular size). 3 stars for the good cheese fries and larger seating area.",

The service has always been good.  This review is about the service and delivery of the food which after eating at so many, I would have hoped for the same.  Came on a Sunday night to intro my bestie to her first bite of the Shack.  Ya'll know the menu can be confusing at first and so it was unnecessary for the cashier to continue to yell at us that she was ready to take our order when we were conveying we were not ready.  Mind you, there was NO line ahead or behind us.  Then we order and my order must have been too small because she repeated: \"That's it?  You don't want nothing else?\" Ok - no biggie, but unnecessary after all the pre-yelling.  Then my buzzer calls I'm the only one within five feet of the pick up with a buzzing buzzer with three employees behind the counter.  Not a one gives a No. 2 about me so I look, it is what I ordered and the ticket has my name on it.  So I put my buzzer down and take the food.  NOW they see me and the employee yells: PUT THAT FOOD DOWN, IT'S NOT YOURS. YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S YOURS. I set it down, she looks at my buzzer, she looks at me, then she goes: oh, haha, it's yours.  And to top the cake, it was the ugliest looking 'shroom burger the Shack has ever presented me.",

    "text": "First off, to give my opinion on the rivalry: I think Shake Shack is much much better than In-N-Out. The burgers are dressed such that you can appreciate the flavor of each ingredient (there's not too many toppings, and one does not overpower any of the others). The burgers are half-wrapped in paper, making the eating much easier, as you can hold the burger by the paper and not have it drip all over you. The crinkle cut fries are crispy on the outside yet soft and steaming hot on the inside (our order came with cheese on top of the fries, and it was still crispy underneath the cheese). The atmosphere is slightly divey, as the wood for the tables look to be recycled from a previous use. It is very warm and brightly lit, and there is sufficient spacing between tables so you don't have to awkwardly glance away from adjacent tables.",

The place is an absolute zoo, but they have it so well organized you almost can't tell. Five of us got a table no problem. Lines were huge too.  Small portions, so be prepared for that.  For all you MLife people out there: Platinum and Noir card holders can skip the line - awesome perk.",

    "text": "I've heard sooo much about Shake Shack and how it compares to In-n-Out so I was looking forward to finally being able to try it for myself!  My friends and I came on a Saturday afternoon during Labor Day weekend and the line was pretty long but it moved fairly quickly. It was actually kind of nice standing in line because it gave us an adequate amount of time to decide what we wanted to order.  After reading through a bunch of reviews, I decided to order the Shack Stack and a side of cheese fries. The burger was a little smaller than I had anticipated but it was still so good nonetheless! I'm a big mushroom lover so the cheesy mushroom on top of the patty made the entire burger taste delicious. The ingredients tasted pretty fresh too. Even my friend who doesn't like mushrooms really enjoyed the bite she tried! From the rest of my friends' feedback from their orders, it seems like the Shack Stack is the only burger worth getting here. I could be wrong.. But they definitely didn't enjoy their burger as much as I enjoyed mine! So if you're a mushroom fan, definitely get the Shack Stack. It won't disappoint!    It is a little on the pricier side and definitely not as cheap as In-n-Out but it was good enough that I'll be back again whenever I'm in town next!",

My husband ordered a shack burger with cheese a Chicago dog and we split the loaded fries. My issue: the topping on the smoke shack and the loaded fries were the same and I had a cherry pepper overdose. Being from Indiana (the capital of the vomit inducing White Castle-originators of the crinkle cut fry) I am not obsessed with crinkle fries since they are common place. The burger was ok, nothing special for me. However, the coffee shake was amazing and I felt like a pretend New Yorker with an ice cream coffee product. My fiance enjoyed his stuff a little more than I did. If a shake shack open by me would I go? Yes. Will I make a special effort when I visiting Vegas again to go? No.",

    "text": "My actual rating: 3.5 -btw, when can we start giving halfsies!?  I had average expectations even though a friend hyped the sh*t out of Shake Shack to the point I was convinced he worked in their PR department. I was apprehensive about writing a review for Shake Shack because well, I just didn't care for it. Especially those super salty, crinkle cut fries that make me feel like I'm eating cafeteria food -remember those yucky Ore Ida fries? Or its overwhelming prices and lack of a salad option -YES, I do realize it's a BURGER place but at these prices and the fact they are closer to a restaurant than a fast food establishment, they could have at least one salad. I mean, even Jack in the Box has salads... Just think about it.  Ordered: - ShackBurger - double cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce.  - Crinkle Cut Fries - cripsy, crunchy, salty potato-y goodness! (copied from their menu. Oh yes, they do mean salty.)  - Beer Float - beer with a scoop of ice cream. Pretty self explanatory haha.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for shelling out a few more dollars for a great, restaurant worthy burger (like at BurGR ;) but not at Shake Shack. Although their burger was good, it didn't WOW me. Neither did their \"oh so famous\" crinkle cut fries, or their beer float. And call me a snob, a B, or any other name because you're one of those die hard SS fans but at these prices, I expect to be WOW'ed or at least impressed.  But I'm not saying they don't make yummy food, because they obviously do which is why they're expanding; [it's just not for me]. I waited to read Kevin's response to the whole Shake Shack vs In-n-Out debate: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thrillist.com%2Feat%2Fnation%2Fshake-shack-vs-in-n-out-which-is-better-shake-shack-or-in-n-out&s=393bff432bf90d83f5b3645ada6bc4bd6570b03fdd3b2dd1bf5038b92cd0ebab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thrillist.com/eat/nation...</a>  But I couldn't agree more with his points. I think if there's a next time, I'll stick to dessert only and maybe a Bag 'o' Bones for my puppy... that's if I get a puppy too lol!  **try it for yourself and form your own opinion; because that's what yelp reviews are: each individual's opinion. :)",

    "text": "I went here during the weekend of the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight. I'm not sure if pricing is the same as the ones in New York or just in Las Vegas, but I thought it was expensive for what I ordered. I took my family here for a late night snack and pretty much ordered almost the same thing all around except for shakes and a beer. We all ordered a single Shackburger and fries. I thought the burger was small for $5. At In N Out, that's almost a Double Double meal. Although $7 for a double cheeseburger is a little expensive, the flavor of the patty does stand out. The Shackmeister Ale was fairly priced at $6.50 as far as beers go at burger joints. I had a chocolate/strawberry shake for dessert because they ran out of vanilla custard. It was a delicious blend of ... you got it... chocolate and strawberry at $5. Shake Shack is worth a try when in Vegas, but I won't be craving it that much for what it's worth. Anyway, good burger joint if you're curious to try, but The Habit Burger and In N Out are still my favorite go-to joints for casual burgers.",

Not impressed at all, actually disappointed in the place . Pricey and lacking burger !! After ordering the double bacon burger and milk shake , mouth was waiting for explosion . Total flop after opening up the bag to see this small ass burger. Needless to say this place was a dud to me IMO . Oh yea the shake was also a bust for me . Never to return !!

We got there past 8PM and there was a line out the door to order food.  We noticed that there were tables inside and outside and since we had our kids with us, we picked a table outside.  I then lined up and it was very organized, someone was manning the door and handing out menus.  I don't believe I waited in the line long at all.  I ordered our food and then they give you those square things to alert you when your food is ready.  The food was actually VERY good and fresh.  We got a couple of shack burgers, fries, choc shake, a grilled cheese for my daughter.  The staff also keeps the whole place clean.  Very clean.  I can't wait to visit one in New York!",

I loved their crinkle fries which was nice and crispy.  The decor is very nice and love the way they did the seating with booths, tables, and couches.  It was very crowded with people consistently coming in and looking for seating as people left.  Wish they had one where I lived.  Their size is similar to In and out burgers which is not huge and their prices were more (not sure if that was the norm of 6.00 or because it was on the Vegas strip).  The shake was good and I ordered the fifty / fifty (like Arnold Palmer with half lemonade and ice tea).  Overall, I enjoyed it!",

This Shake Shack joint located in the New York New York hotel and casino is very easy to find (right by their Brooklyn bridge outside). I had a late lunch here on a Thursday, so there was just a very short line and ample seatings. I know, pre-tty rare for any Shake Shack. Unlike the New York locations, this restaurant is very spacious with a big screen, great for sports fans. My go-to order is their single Shackburger with cheese fries. Best part, is the food taste exactly like the NY Shake Shacks. I did try their shake flavor of the week, which was caramel pretzel...it wasn't very good, too sweet for my liking. But that didn't take away my first West Coast Shake Shack experience. Can't wait for the West Hollywood location to open next yr!",

I don't care about cost, because nothing in Vegas is affordable.  The burger was mehhh, the fries were Ore-Ida with nacho cheese sauce on them.  Not sure what the hullaballoo is about this place, but I'll take 5 guys any day of the week!  If you want a better experience go across the street to Fat Burger, it'll massacre Shake Shake every day of the week and twice on sunday!  Shake Shack's stock is tanking for a reason.......BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT GOOD!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of In-n-out so with all the Shake Shack hype, I was totally excited to try this place. Got a standard double shack burger, fries and a chocolate malt.  Burger was decent, seasoned well, bun was good.  Shack sauce is some kind of garlicky mayonaise.  I'm more of a mustard dude but it was ok.   Fries were your everyday crinkle cut fries, nothing special.  You can also get them with cheese which pretty much tastes like that canned cheese you get on nachos at the theater.  Where they failed me was the chocolate malt.   It had that over whipped foamy consistency like you get at a place like McDonald's.  I finally just threw it out.  Daughter had a concrete which looked nothing like the pictures.  Tiny little cup, half melted, with most of the cup being an empty hole from the blender.  At $46 bucks for a family of three, I wish we would of just took a cab to In-n-out.",

I thought these burgers were going to blow my mind, but they didnt. The extra star is for having a a cocktail drinks menu.",

Yes the taste is fairly good, presentation is there, flavor and textures are there... But I will not compare to other places since other places has different types of burgers and toppings.  Overall I will come back again.. and try other burgers and shakes.  :)",

    "text": "I see a lot of people comparing shake shack to in n out and I'll be straight up about that in n out is still Better. Haha you could never compare the almighty in n out to anything. As far as Shake shack, the food reminded me of a Wendy's bacon burger but bigger non squar patties and better taste. Only thing that made it different was the cherry peppers and sauce. But watch if u think you'll be like damn this guy is right. I had smoke shack double and fries and wasn't full after, Im literally going order more food bc I wasn't that impressed. Heard so much hype about this spot but it was nothing orgasmic or like made me wanna react like this a miracle of a burger. Mind you this based on what I ate. I didn't try any desserts or anything else. The pricing is way overpriced probably because it's founded in New York. I'm west coast born and raised so I'll always be biast. If I visited New York again I would not go out of my way to go to shake shack, I bet no one has said that yet... That alone should change ur mind. This is suppose to be a New York staple and it was whatever. I spent 15 dollars on a burger, fries, and drinks that alone ruined my appetite. Pricing is mayb more then New York to bc its on the strip. Who knows ..the pricing sucked for what your getting. Don't get me wrong the burger was a bomb ass burger cooked medium well...but damn 9.49 for a double burger...2.95 for freezer fries..2.25 for reg soda that was the size of a water cup.I thought this was suppose to be fast food not a restaurant I don't know what it was but mayb I should of asked for sauces on the side to dip in or customize my burger... Something to make me feel like I didn't get ripped off.........   Well round two let's see what's up. Hopefully this time it redeems my first experience. Ok round two was ten times better then my first round. Get the shack stack and a concrete and don't mess with anything else. That burger alone did it for me. Might be one of the best burgers I've ever had tell u the truth. So if your a shroom lover its on",

The cheese was put on the side since I ordered togo (which is better anyways, keeps the fries from getting soggy for slow eaters like myself). The Shack stack is the cheeseburger with a fried mushroom. Meat was good, mushroom was good, veggies are fresh & the cheese was pretty tasty. The only complaint I have is that when I requested the buns to be extra toasted the cashier says they run their buns through a machine so it'll burn the second round in. At In N Out, it is more possible since they toast their buns on the grill. Overall, I see why the east coast takes pride in this joint but In N Out still has my heart",

I'm not sure if it was because we were hungover, but the smokeshack burger was waaayyy too heavy. it has smoked bacon, chopped red chiles all smothered in sauce. #nothanks. the plain regular burger was the only thing we were able to finish, the lettuce & tomatoes tasted really fresh.   had in-n-out before we headed out back to los angeles, nothing compares. really.",

    "text": "There was a lot of hype about Shake Shack. I was very excited to go because Shake Shack is originally from New York,and I had heard that executives will send their secretaries to wait in line. Of course I was very eager to try this place, but I also hate going on the strip. I finally tried this place a few days.   I ordered the shack stack which comes with the one hamburger patty and a deep fried portobello mushroom with cheese. When I first bit into my burger, I thought wow this is amazing. It tastes so great. The patty is so flavorful. However, the way the burger is stuffed, I only got to bit into one bun and not both at the same time. After a while, it just got really really salty which was great because I could drink my lemonade. Only they stuffed my cup with ice and I only had a few sips of lemonade. Not worth it for $2.75 and what appeared to be a 12 oz cup.   When I first ordered, I ordered a shake stack, but I was charged for a double. I don't eat that much, so I did get a refund. However, they confused me. They should have told me they reopened my check and voided the amount. I thought they were going to do a refund and then recharge me, so I was very confused until my friend explained it to me.   I would consider maybe going again only if I had an out of town guest who wanted to visit. It's too pricey to be worth it.",

My first time having it and they butchered my order, which made me mad when I got home to enjoy my burger which I couldn't at all because it was wrong. Spent close to $20 per person and was not happy. I made sure to repeat my order back multiple times so how they got the whole thing wrong I don't know.  Shake was decent, I've had far better. I don't see the big hype of this place other than it being the first west coast restaurant.   Average food. Would have been better if I actually got what I ordered.",

    "text": "Shake Shack is here! And. About. Fricking. Time!  I've been looking forward to this location opening for the longest time. And already I've eaten here 4 times in my 2 trips to Vegas this month.   The first time my friend told me about Shake Shack, I was in disbelieve when he told me he thought the burgers at SS tasted better than In-N-Out. We're both In-N-Out faithfuls (and SoCal residents) so to hear this came as a bit of a shock and disbelief. And then I tried Shake Shack last year in Boston for the first time. And I was an instant fan. Since then, I've been craving Shake Shack for countless months and now it's only hours away in the West Coast!   Is Shake Shack truly better than In-N-Out? That will always be the big debate for Californians.  I would have to say yes (*gasp!) but it also depends on what you're basing it on.  For overall value, quality, fries, and those toasted buns, In-N-Out wins.  But for overall flavor and the taste of the meat, Shake Shack truly shines. And aren't the elements of a good hamburger judged on the quality and flavor of the meat patty, anyway? And their shakes are also just as delicious. They're thick, but you can still manage to easily suck through the straw without getting a hangover.  First timers, try the original ShackBurger to start your In-N-Out comparisons.  For those that want a kick in flavor, get the SmokeShack burger.  But my current favorite is the new ShackMeister with onion strings. It's full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Pair it with crinkle cut fries and a Red Velvet Shake, and life is complete. Enjoy.",

    "text": "i'm sure there will be an ongoing comparison between in n out and shake shack. it's unnecessary. both are great in their own ways. my friends and i went to vegas just to try shake shack. that's right, we drove 4+hrs for a burger. was it worth it? combined with the experience and spontaneity with friends, sure!   we made it here shortly before closing ~1:45am on a saturday and there was no line. we ordered one of each burger, the shackmeister hot dog, regular fries, and cheese fries to share. they have their own unique names but basically you have the (burger) options of: a hamburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger w/cherry peppers + bacon, the shroom burger, and the shroom + cheeseburger combined. burgers have special sauce and all the other stuff you'd expect in a burger (lettuce, tomatoes..).   the verdict? the meat burgers were solid and delicious, but not uhhhhhmazing. couldn't even taste the special sauce, and pretty small. the surprising favorite of mine is THE SHROOM BURGER. it's this amazingly deep fried pocket filled with a portabello mushroom and oozing Muenster cheese. it's so delicately fried, but packed with lots of flavor, and the mushroom is nice and tender. hands down my favorite burger there.   the shackmeister dog was nothing extraordinary. tasted like any other hot dog, but with crispy fried shallots at the top. good, but meh. my friends also tried the shackmeister ale and were impressed. as for the fries debate: cheese vs no cheese? i actually preferred the non cheese one because the cheese makes it soggy..HOWEVER, you can also ask for cheese on the side so i'd recommend doing that. best of both worlds.   service was great even though it was so late at night, lots of seating, beautiful venue with pretty glittery sign. DEFINITELY recommend this place i'm a hardcore in-n-out fan and will stick with their burgers, but the shroom burger is outta this world! we wanted to grab some burgers to bring back home, but the next day, line was loooooong around noon =(   TLDR: get the SHROOM BURGER, get regular fries and ask for CHEESE SAUCE on the side.",

Burgers were juicy, and their crinkle cut fries were delicious. Pricing is more expensive than in and Out, but still one of the most popular/affordable eats on the strip. They also serve beer!",

I ordered a chocolate peanut butter shake and when it was delivered to me they had a sticker covering the straw hole that said contains nuts.  Why would you do that???    I ordered an order of Cheese fries which were delicious   I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger add bacon minus tomatoes.   It came with cheese, bacon and meat.  Where is the onion, the pickle, lettuce?      On the menu it kept referring to a \"shake sauce\" on all the burgers and I asked the guy taking my order what it was and I was told I can't tell you.  I asked if it was mayo based and he again repeated I can't tell you.     As I was rushed through my order and could tell I was treated just as another person will cause me not to return here as I attend different events on the strip monthly and I will now take my business elsewhere due to the customer service but I am sure 1 person won't make this place change that.",

There is a lot of seating, tables inside and picnic tables outside. I had the Shack Stack (beef patty, mushroom patty, and cheese), cheese fries, and the fall special pumpkin concrete. It was a very good meal. I was stuffed afterward. (And yet I still had room for a crepe inside New York New York... I come to Vegas ready to eat!) Next time, I would probably try a different burger. The Shack Stack is good-- I like mushrooms, but they're not always my favorite, so the mushroom patty could be overpowering. I would like to try the Smoke Shack with bacon. The concrete was good, but I didn't know that concrete was ice cream, so I was expecting a shake. The cheese fries- delish. I would love to return here any time I'm on the Las Vegas strip.",

A few minutes later we'd arrived!  Very short line - we ordered 2 smoke stacks (one a double) an order of regular fries, one order of cheese fries, a small lemonade, and a bottled water.  We got our beeper and began hunting for a table. The short line was deceiving - this place was packed! Eventually we found a table. There's ample amounts of seats but it was very busy (and raining.)  Got the food - great burger. I loved the peppers paired with the lettuce and bacon. Sooo good! The cheese fries - eh. If liquified cheese is your thing, then go for it! Next time we'll just stick with the filtered water on tap, and get shakes instead.   $2.89 for the small lemonade $2.49 for the bottled water. $3.99 for the cheese fries, $2.99 for the regular fries, $6.99 for the single, and $9.79 for the double burger.. The prices were a bit steep.  I'd definitely come back while in Vegas, because the burgers and shakes are so tasty. Next time I'd visit while walking down the strip to avoid the parking fee (0-60 min free, anything over that ranges from $7-10.) Again, only gripes parking and pricing...I think I'm just too used to in-n-out. Having only been to be NYC locations, I think this is a well executed west coast version.",

We got the Shackburger and the Roadside burger (which may be seasonal? a new addition?), an order of cheese fries, and their Sin cider.  + The Shackburger was basically their classic cheeseburger, and I have to say, I think they do it much better than In-n-Out.  + Their Roadside burger was like a cheeseburger with caramelized onions and no veggies; it was okay but I definitely missed the produce.  + I love cheese so the cheese fries were a win in my book.  + Cider was okay, but was super carbonated IMO. I didn't eat much before lunch, so it definitely hit me a lot harder than it probably should have.   Any service you got was limited to ordering at the cash register, getting a buzzer, and waiting for your order to be ready at the counter. Very friendly during my visit.  The restaurant itself looked very modern, and had a mix of both outdoor and indoor seating.  Bathroom was pretty small. I think there were like two stalls and only one sink. Clean enough.  On our way out, we noticed the line out the door, and was glad we grabbed an early lunch. It was nice that they were handing out tea samples while you waited though (Their peach green tea was pretty sweet though)!  Would come back again for sure. In the meantime, I'll keep praying for them to expand to the Bay sooner!",
